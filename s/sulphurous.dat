5|$|In {{the first}} letter to Tacitus, Pliny the Younger {{suggested}} that his uncle's death {{was due to the}} reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, <b>sulphurous</b> gas that wafted over the group. However, Stabiae was 16km from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the volcanic gases, and so {{it is more likely that}} the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack. His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.|$|E

25|$|During World War I, the gas industry's by-products, phenol, toluene and ammonia and <b>sulphurous</b> {{compounds}} were valuable {{ingredients for}} explosives.

25|$|Pierre Choderlos de Laclos (1741–1803), {{the author}} of Les Liaisons dangereuses was first {{artillery}} officer, involved {{in the development of}} the hollow ball, charged with explosives, bursting on impact. In 1777 he received the mission to install the deemed Régiment de La Fère at Valence in the future barracks of the polygon. It was back in Besançon in the summer 1778, perhaps inspired by his city stay, that he undertook the drafting of hiss <b>sulphurous</b> novel.|$|E
25|$|Admiral Chambers {{on board}} the Montague, 4 November 1749, was taking an {{observation}} just before noon...he observed a large ball of blue fire about three miles distant from them. They immediately lowered their topsails, but it came up so fast upon them, that, before they could raise the main tack, they observed the ball rise almost perpendicularly, and not above forty or fifty yards from the main chains when it went off with an explosion, as great as if a hundred cannons had been discharged at the same time, leaving behind it a strong <b>sulphurous</b> smell. By this explosion the main top-mast was shattered into pieces and the main mast {{went down to the}} keel.|$|E
25|$|An {{overview}} of the eruption and seismic activity so far was published on IMO's website on 3 December. Insubstantial changes in the eruption occurred in December 2014. The lava field had increased to 82.8km2. The lava ran in a closed channel to the east 15km from the Baugur crater. M5+ quakes continued in the caldera; on December 19, vertical displacement at the caldera was measured at 56 metres. The eruption continued to emit intense <b>sulphurous</b> gasses which affected air quality throughout Iceland, depending on the weather conditions. On 25 December, a new earthquake sequence was recorded at the Geysir geothermal field 140 kilometres west of Bárðarbunga; the activity lasted for two days before fading out.|$|E
25|$|A VEI 3 {{eruption}} occurred from 17 January 1991 to 11 March 1991, producing 0.15km3 of lava and 2×107m3 of tephra. The eruption, {{which was}} preceded by <b>sulphurous</b> smells and earthquakes, started as a Plinian eruption, producing an ash cloud reaching an altitude of 11.5km within 10minutes which had travelled over 200km north-northeast to the coast within 3hours. The eruption then began producing andesitic lava, the flows eventually covering an area of 23km2 to an average depth of 6–7m. Initially, part of the Heklugja fissure and other fissures erupted with lava fountains reaching 300m in height. By the second day, the activity stopped {{in all but one}} fissure where the main crater formed. During these 2days, 800m3·s−1 of lava were produced, slowing to between 1m3s−1 and 14m3·s−1 for most of the eruption. This low viscosity lava had a SiO2 content of approximately 54%.|$|E
25|$|Both Suther and Régine Tessier, {{the latter}} in a sketch of Sage in Notable American Women: The Modern Period, note key {{features}} of Sage’s mature work. Most of Sage’s paintings focus on free-standing architectural structures, including walls, towers, and latticework, which could represent buildings either under construction or ruined and decaying. Some contain figures that {{might or might not}} be human, hidden by flowing drapery. (Le Passage, one of Sage’s last paintings, is perhaps the only one containing a definite human figure; even Small Portrait, thought by many to be a self-portrait, is hardly recognizable as a face.) Like Tanguy, Sage often sets her objects on deserts or plains that recede to immeasurably distant horizons. She renders her forms in meticulous, photographic detail, using a gray-green-ochre palette that Tessier describes as “reminiscent of the <b>sulphurous</b> light before a thunderstorm”. Critics frequently called Sage’s work disturbing or depressing, even when they praised her painterly skill.|$|E
25|$|The Greenside smelt mill {{was built}} in 182728, down in the Glenridding valley {{at the bottom of}} the Swart Beck, where there was a good water supply and where fuel could be brought up the valley without too much difficulty. Inside the mill there was {{probably}} a furnace to prepare the ore and a single ore hearth. The air blast was produced by bellows powered by a water wheel. Further buildings were erected in the 1830s, to house a slag hearth furnace, and a silver refinery. There was no extended chimney: clouds of toxic lead oxides and acid <b>sulphurous</b> fumes would have made the valley an unhealthy place. The flue {{was built in}} 1841 to a chimney 150m up the hillside; in 1855 it was extended to a chimney on the ridge above. Later, loops were added to increase its length. This long flue not only removed the noxious fumes, it also enabled the lead-rich dust to be recovered and returned to the smelter. The flue was built as a stone-arched cutting, following or cut into the bedrock. This served as a giant prospecting cross-cut and proved there was no extension to the Greenside Vein to the south.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cold weather}} {{preceding}} {{and during the}} Great Smog led Londoners to burn more coal than usual to keep warm. Post-war domestic coal tended to be of a relatively low-grade, <b>sulphurous</b> variety (economic necessity meant that better-quality [...] "hard" [...] coals tended to be exported), which increased the amount of sulphur dioxide in the smoke. There were also numerous coal-fired power stations in the Greater London area, including Fulham, Battersea, Bankside, Greenwich and Kingston upon Thames, all of which added to the pollution. According to the UK's Met Office, the following pollutants were emitted each day during the smoggy period: 1,000 tonnes of smoke particles, 140 tonnes of hydrochloric acid, 14 tonnes of fluorine compounds, and 370 tonnes of sulphur dioxide {{which may have been}} converted to 800 tonnes of sulphuric acid.|$|E

By the mid-eighteenth century, many houses in Shadwell had been rebuilt. [...] "Seamen, watermen and lightermen, coalheavers and shopkeepers, and ropemakers, coopers, carpenters and smiths, lived in small lathe and plaster or weatherboard houses, two storeys and a garret high, with one room on each floor"; the average rent was £2-7. In 1767, London coal workers who were protesting for higher wages began shooting at the landlord of the Roundabout Tavern in Shadwell; as a result, seven of them were hanged in the Sun Tavern fields. Their execution was witnessed by around 50,000 spectators, the largest crowd at a hanging since the hanging of Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers in 1760. in 1794, many houses on the Ratcliffe Highway were destroyed by a fire which [...] "consumed more houses than any one conflagration has done since the Great Fire of London", and also destroyed many boats, and around £40,000 of sugar.|$|E

The authorities, abandoning the mill, sought to save the warehouse, directing all their efforts on it, and were reinforced by the military with their fire engine. This effort was thwarted by the wide scattering of burning brands from the fallen factory roof, which gave additional stimulation to the burning sulphur. By 3 am, the entire warehouse was one body of flames [...] "most awfully magnificent". The <b>sulphurous</b> blaze illuminated the river and its shipping, the High Level Bridge, the Castle, the steeples of All Saints', St. Nicholas' and St. Mary's churches, and every prominent object, with a lurid purple light. From the various floors of the warehouse the sulphur flowed in torrents like streams of lava, and the building resembled [...] "a cataract on fire".
