40|$|The {{majority}} of gastrointestinal (GI) foreign bodies (FBs) discovered in adults {{are the result}} of intentional ingestion, most of which are found in patients with a preexisting psychiatric illness, with substance abuse disorders, or in people seeking secondary gain. No similar case of internal injuries following unintentional ingestion of a barbecue grill <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush</b> bristle has been reported. A 58 -year-old Caucasian male with no significant history presented with complaint of halitosis, not improving after oral care and dental hygiene measures. He denied any other symptoms. After ruling out oral causes of halitosis, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, which revealed a black wire-shaped metallic FB embedded in the duodenum. The FB was identified as a silver metallic flexible wire resembling the bristle of a barbecue grill <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush.</b> The halitosis resolved completely within 3 weeks of the removal of the FB. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of duodenal impaction of a barbecue grill <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush</b> bristle atypically presenting with halitosis. Physicians’ awareness of this potential injury from grill <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush</b> bristles would lead to a quick diagnosis after a focused history. Also avid grillers must be made aware of this potential hazard and should be encouraged to carefully examine the barbecue grill surface for any remnant bristle of the grill <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush.</b> Appropriate history taking, considering GI causes as potentially inducing halitosis, and an awareness of this entity among providers are important to facilitate prompt diagnoses and prevent major adverse outcomes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the accelerated ageing of polymer film reflecting surfaces under the conditions {{to be found}} during contact cleaning of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) collectors {{in the presence of}} dust and sand particles.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the accelerated ageing of commercially available silvered polymer film by contact <b>cleaning</b> using <b>brushes</b> {{and water in}} the presence of soiling created by dust and sand particles. These conditions represent cleaning regimes in real concentrating solar power (CSP) solar fields in arid environments, where contact <b>cleaning</b> using <b>brushes</b> and water is often required to clean the reflecting surfaces. Whilst suitable for glass reflectors, this paper discusses the effects of these established cleaning processes on the optical and visual characteristics of polymer film surfaces, and then {{describes the}} development of a more benign but effective contact cleaning process for cleaning polymer reflectors. The effects of a range of <b>cleaning</b> <b>brushes</b> are discussed, with and without the presence of water, {{in the presence of}} sand and dust particles from selected representative locations. The experiments were repeated using different experimental equipment at Plataforma Solar de Almería (PSA) in Spain and Cranfield University in the UK. The results highlight differences that are attributable to the experimental methods used. Reflectance measurements and visual inspection show that a soft <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush</b> {{with a small amount of}} water, used in a cleaning head with both linear and rotational motion, can clean polymer film reflecting surfaces without inflicting surface damage or reducing specular reflectance...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} clean the {{surfaces}} of air ducts in underground facilities, recent {{research has been conducted}} on driving the control and development of an autonomous mobile duct-cleaning platform. The duct-cleaning robots removes contaminants that are inside a duct using the friction between a rotating <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush</b> and the duct surface. For the effective removal of the contaminants and stable steering control of the autonomous mobile platform, the interaction force between the brush and the duct surface needs to be measured. However, {{it is not possible to}} achieve an accurate measurement of the contact force for the duct surface and brush, which has a nonlinear deformation characteristic. Therefore, in this study, a simple and robust controller has been proposed. This controller integrates the backstepping method with an I-PD controller for the robust platform control against irregular external forces on the <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush.</b> In addition, various trajectory tracking simulations have been conducted and the results present stable trajectory tracking of the mobile platform in air duct cleaning...|$|R

The name has long been in use for this type of brush, so named because its cleaning end resembles a [...] "wild" [...] head of hair. Turk's head brushes and brooms are used for domestic purposes, for cleaning artillery, for pharmaceutical use, for sweeping chimneys, and for other purposes.|$|R

Dual <b>cleaning</b> <b>brush</b> assemblies (to remove debris) and electric power winders (to reduce manual labor during cover removal) are normally used to efficiently maintain the covers while the carpet based gym covers are best cleaned using the Host Cleaning method with the covers still in place.|$|R
