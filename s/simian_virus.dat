25|$|Greater than 80% of {{mesothelioma}} {{cases are}} caused by exposure to asbestos. The greater the exposure the greater the risk. As of 2013 about 125 million people {{have been exposed to}} asbestos at work. High rates of disease occur in people who mine asbestos, produce products from asbestos, work with asbestos products, live with asbestos workers, or work in buildings containing asbestos. Asbestos exposure and the onset of cancer are generally separated by about 40 years. Washing the clothing of someone who worked with asbestos also increases the risk. Other risk factors include genetics and infection with the <b>simian</b> <b>virus</b> 40. The diagnosis may be suspected based on chest X-ray and CT scan findings, and is confirmed by either examining fluid produced by the cancer or by a tissue biopsy of the cancer.|$|E

40|$|Cross-neutralization and {{complement}} fixation tests demonstrated the immunological {{identity of the}} Delta herpesvirus, the 592 S virus, the Liverpool vervet monkey virus, the herpesvirus of patas monkeys, and the Medical Lake macaque virus. These viruses were isolated from diverse outbreaks of varicella-like disease in simians and from various simian species. All of the <b>simian</b> <b>viruses</b> were shown {{to be related to}} human varicella-zoster (V-Z) virus, as evidenced by the fact that immunization of monkeys with each of the <b>simian</b> <b>viruses</b> elicited the production of both neutralizing and complement-fixing antibodies to V-Z virus. However, cross-{{complement fixation}} tests indicated that the <b>simian</b> <b>viruses</b> are not so closely related to V-Z virus as they are to one another. Varicella or zoster infections in humans produced neutralizing and complement-fixing antibody responses to each of the simian viruses; the responses were more marked in zoster infections than in varicella infections but, in most patients, antibody levels produced to the <b>simian</b> <b>viruses</b> were much lower than those to the homologous V-Z virus...|$|R
40|$|<b>Simian</b> {{immunodeficiency}} <b>viruses,</b> <b>simian</b> T-cell lymphotropic <b>viruses,</b> and <b>simian</b> foamy <b>viruses</b> from nonhuman primates {{have crossed}} the species barrier to humans at several time points, leading to the HIV and human T lymphotropic virus epidemic and to sporadic cases of human infections with <b>simian</b> foamy <b>viruses,</b> respectively. Efficient infection and spread in humans differs between <b>simian</b> foamy <b>virus,</b> <b>simian</b> lymphotropic <b>virus,</b> and <b>simian</b> immunodeficiency <b>virus,</b> but seems also to differ among the different viruses from the same simian lineage, {{as illustrated by the}} different spread of HIV- 1 M, N O, P or for the different HIV- 2 groups. Among the four HIV- 1 groups, only HIV- 1 group M has spread worldwide, and the actual diversity within HIV- 1 M (subtypes, circulating recombinants) is the result of subsequent evolution and spread in the human population. HIV- 2 only spread to some extent in West Africa, and similarly as for HIV- 1, the nine HIV- 2 groups have also a different epidemic history. Four types of human T lymphotropic virus, type 1 to 4, have been described in humans and for three of them simian counterparts (simian T lymphotropic virus- 1, - 2,- 3) have been identified in multiple nonhuman primate species. The majority of human infections are with human T lymphotropic virus- 1, which is present throughout the world as clusters of high endemicity. Humans are susceptible {{to a wide variety of}} <b>simian</b> foamy <b>viruses</b> and seem to acquire these viruses more readily than <b>simian</b> immunodeficiency <b>viruses</b> or <b>simian</b> T lymphotropic <b>viruses,</b> but neither signs of disease in humans nor human-to-human transmission of <b>simian</b> foamy <b>virus</b> have been documented yet. The current HIV- 1 M epidemic illustrates the impact of a single cross-species transmission. The recent discovery of HIV- 1 P, HIV- 2 I, new human T lymphotropic virus- 1 and - 3 variants, as well as <b>simian</b> foamy <b>virus</b> infections in humans in Central Africa, show that our knowledge of genetic diversity and cross-species transmissions of simian retroviruses is still incomplete...|$|R
25|$|The {{epidemic}} of the immunodeficiency disease AIDS, {{which began in}} Sub-Saharan Africa in the 1930s as a mutation of the chimpanzee disease SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus), which was named Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), {{found its way to}} the shores of the United States as early as 1960, but was first noticed after doctors discovered clusters of Kaposi's sarcoma and pneumocystis pneumonia in young gay men in Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco in 1981. This strain was called HIV-1. A second strain, called HIV-2 was discovered; it is presumed to have mutated from SIVsmm, a strain of the <b>Simian</b> <b>virus</b> present naturally in the sooty mangabey, a monkey found primarily along the African coast from Senegal to Ghana. HIV-2 is common in West Africa, but is much rarer in the United States than HIV-1, which is more virulent and progresses more quickly to the fully fledged AIDS disease.|$|E
2500|$|When {{two or more}} viruses, each {{containing}} lethal genomic damage infect {{the same}} host cell, the virus genomes often can pair {{with each other and}} undergo homologous recombinational repair to produce viable progeny. [...] This process is known as multiplicity reactivation.

2500|$|Urine {{that leaves}} {{the body of a}} healthy person is close to being sterile and {{requires}} much less treatment for pathogen removal than feces or fecal sludge. However, a contamination of urine with fecal pathogens is possible if the UDDT is not used correctly, i.e. when some fecal matter finds its way into the urine compartment. Also, for a few specific diseases, the relevant pathogens may be found in the urine; for example: Leptospira interrogans, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi, Schistosoma haematobium, BK virus or <b>Simian</b> <b>virus.</b> The Ebola virus may also be found in urine from an infected person.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 2 (HIV- 2) {{is the result}} of cross-species transmission of <b>simian</b> immunodeficiency <b>virus</b> (SIV) from sooty mangabey monkeys to humans. Primer pairs (intHIV- 2 /SIV) based on a region of integrase that has considerable homology across HIV- 2 and SIV lineages were designed to develop a broadly cross-reactive molecular assay to detect lentivirus infection in primates. The intHIV- 2 /SIV primers detect HIV- 2 and <b>simian</b> <b>viruses</b> SIVcpz, SIVsmm, SIVsyk, SIVagm, and SIVmnd. The primers are also capable of amplifying some HIV- 1 strains. Additionally, sequences from the integrase amplicons were of sufficient genetic diversity to permit not only phylogenetic clustering of all <b>simian</b> <b>viruses</b> to their respective lineages but also HIV type and group classification. Thus, the primers described here provide a method to detect primate lentiviruses from diverse species of nonhuman primates, as well as from persons infected with HIV- 1 and HIV- 2...|$|R
40|$|Because Gibraltar’s macaques (Macaca sylvanus) have {{frequent}} {{contact with}} humans, we assayed 79 macaques for antibodies to enzootic primate viruses. All macaques were seronegative for herpesvirus B, <b>simian</b> T-cell lymphotropic <b>virus,</b> <b>simian</b> retrovirus, <b>simian</b> immunodefi ciency <b>virus,</b> and rhesus cytomegalovirus. Seroprevalence of <b>simian</b> foamy <b>virus</b> reached 88 % among adult animals. Animal reservoirs {{are the most}} likely sources of emerging infectious diseases that threaten human populations (1). Infectious agents from nonhuman primates, in particular, have caused a disproportionate number of new human diseases, leading to calls for international surveillance to monitor the human–nonhuman primate interface. This recognition in turn prompts a need for data focusing on areas and contexts in which humans and nonhuman primates come into contact, creating the potential for zoonotic transmission (2, 3). Over the past decades, several viruses enzootic to nonhuman primates have been described, and a substantial amount of literature is devoted to their biology, genetics, and capacity to cause disease in humans. The most well known among these, in terms of public health, is <b>simian</b> immunodeficiency <b>virus</b> (SIV), the progenitor of HIV.

Watson and Francis Crick's publication {{of the structure of}} DNA in 1953 and Fred Sanger's publication of the Amino acid sequence of insulin in 1955, nucleic acid sequencing became a major target of early molecular biologists. In 1964, Robert W. Holley and colleagues published the first nucleic acid sequence ever determined, the ribonucleotide sequence of alanine transfer RNA. Extending this work, Marshall Nirenberg and Philip Leder revealed the triplet nature of the genetic code and were able to determine the sequences of 54 out of 64 codons in their experiments. In 1972, Walter Fiers and his team at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the University of Ghent (Ghent, Belgium) were the first to determine the sequence of a gene: the gene for Bacteriophage MS2 coat protein. Fiers' group expanded on their MS2 coat protein work, determining the complete nucleotide-sequence of bacteriophage MS2-RNA (whose genome encodes just four genes in 3569 base pairs [...] ) and <b>Simian</b> <b>virus</b> 40 in 1976 and 1978, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Hunting and {{butchering}} {{of wildlife}} in Central Africa are known {{risk factors for}} a variety of human diseases, including HIV/AIDS. Due to the high incidence of human exposure to body fluids of non-human primates, the significant prevalence of <b>simian</b> immunodeficiency <b>virus</b> (SIV) in non-human primates, and hunting/butchering associated cross-species transmission of other retroviruses in Central Africa, it is possible that SIV is actively transmitted to humans from primate species other than mangabeys, chimpanzees, and/or gorillas. We evaluated SIV transmission to humans by screening 2, 436 individuals that hunt and butcher non-human primates, a population in which <b>simian</b> foamy <b>virus</b> and <b>simian</b> T-lymphotropic <b>virus</b> were previously detected. We identified 23 individuals with high seroreactivity to SIV.

The other virus, isolated from Congolese bonobos (Pan paniscus), is a distinct member of the HTLV- 2 clade and has been designated STLV- 2. The isolation of these two <b>simian</b> <b>viruses</b> shows that the spectrum of HTLVs/STLVs is larger than previously expected.

These data, together with our phylogenetic analyses, suggest an African origin of the HTLV/STLV ancestor, which provides new clues about virus dissemination. Furthermore, the atypical serological profiles exhibited by STLV-L or STLV- 2 infected animals in western blot, raise questions about the efficiency of current screening methods to type highly divergent HTLVs/STLVs.
