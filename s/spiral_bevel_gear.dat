40|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> are {{important}} components on all current rotorcraft drive systems. These components {{are required to}} operate at high speeds, high loads, and for an extremely large number of load cycles. In this application, <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> are used to redirect the shaft from the horizontal gas turbine engine to the vertical rotor. Because of the high expense of manufacturing these gears, methods that can achieve {{the same level of}} performance at reduced cost are highly desirable to aerospace gear manufacturers. Gears manufactured for aerospace applications use high-quality materials and are manufactured to tight tolerances. Special manufacturing machine tools and computer numerically controlled coordinate measurement systems have enabled rotorcraft drive system manufacturers to produce extremely high-quality gears during their normal production. Because of low production rates for rotorcraft, these gears are manufactured in small batches, and thus are unable to benefit from the economics of high production numbers as in other industries. In this investigation, two different manufacturing methods, face-milled and face-hobbed, were used to fabricate <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears.</b> For face-milled <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears,</b> grinding of the contacting surfaces is the final manufacturing step. At least two different specialty machines are needed to generate the teeth for face-milled <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears.</b> For face-hobbed gears, hard cutting is the final manufacturing process. The same machine is used to rough cut and finish cut the gears. This study compared the operational behavior of face-milled <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> with that of face-hobbed <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears.</b> Test hardware was manufactured to fit within NASA Glenn Research Center's <b>Spiral</b> <b>Bevel</b> Test Facility and to aerospace quality standards. Tests were conducted for stress, vibration, and noise. A comparison of the results attained indicated that the face-hobbed gears had a lower alternating stress level with a more even distribution of loading across the teeth, and slightly reduced levels of vibration and noise. Results of this study show that the face-hobbed method is a viable and lower-cost alternative for producing aerospace-quality spiral-bevel gears...|$|R

50|$|A hypoid {{is a type}} of <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> whose axis {{does not}} {{intersect}} with the axis of the meshing gear. The shape of a hypoid gear is a revolved hyperboloid (that is, the pitch surface of the hypoid gear is a hyperbolic surface), whereas the shape of a <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> is normally conical. The hypoid gear places the pinion off-axis to the crown wheel (ring gear) which allows the pinion to be larger in diameter and have more contact area. In hypoid gear design, the pinion and gear are practically always of opposite hand, and the spiral angle of the pinion is usually larger than that of the gear. The hypoid pinion is then larger in diameter than an equivalent bevel pinion.|$|E

50|$|Hypoid gears {{are still}} common in larger trucks {{because they can}} {{transmit}} higher torque. A higher hypoid offset allows the gear to transmit higher torque. However increasing the hypoid offset results in reduction of mechanical efficiency and a consequent reduction in fuel economy. For practical purposes, it is often impossible to replace low efficiency hypoid gears with more efficient spiral bevel gears in automotive use because the <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> would need a much larger diameter to transmit the same torque.

A limited slip differential was standard on some models and optional on others. The first generation IRS always had the disc brakes mounted inboard, the brake units being located immediately adjacent to the differential and braking its output shafts.|$|E

The first bikes were chain driven but changed to 1.5 in Dayton belts in the early 1990s. The ratio of the gear box used was 1.53:1. In 1999, a one-speed semi-automatic transmission was available for the motorcycles that utilized a torque converter and a pump {{with a set of}} clutch plates and steels basically added to the previous design gearbox, which worked very well.

50|$|By 1943, Partridge Wilson were {{producing}} {{vehicles with}} payloads of 7/10 cwt, 15 cwt, 18/25 cwt, and 40 cwt. The first three {{were aimed at}} the retail delivery market, and so were mainly supplied as bread vans and milk floats, while the 40 cwt model {{was designed as a}} lorry. All models were fitted with series traction motors and Bendix brakes. The 7/10 cwt model included a drum-type controller, with a constant delay between the stages. The larger vehicles used a fluid foot controller to regulate the speed of the vehicle. By this time they were using starting resistances, which were switched out of circuit as a camshaft on the controller rotated. Power was transmitted to the rear axle through a propellor shaft with Hardy-Spicer flexible couplings and a <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear.</b> On the larger models, the propellor shaft had Hardy-Spicer needle-roller joints, and was connected to an overslung worm drive on the rear axle. There was also a 30 cwt lorry with a tipping body available, although Hills in his summary of electric vehicles gives no further details, and the Wilson-Scammell electric horse was still in production.|$|E
50|$|Hypoid gears {{resemble}} {{spiral bevel}} gears except the shaft axes do not intersect. The pitch surfaces appear conical but, {{to compensate for the}} offset shaft, are in fact hyperboloids of revolution. Hypoid gears are almost always designed to operate with shafts at 90 degrees. Depending on which side the shaft is offset to, relative to the angling of the teeth, contact between hypoid gear teeth may be even smoother and more gradual than with <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> teeth, but also have a sliding action along the meshing teeth as it rotates and therefore usually require some of the most viscous types of gear oil to avoid it being extruded from the mating tooth faces, the oil is normally designated HP (for hypoid) followed by a number denoting the viscosity. Also, the pinion can be designed with fewer teeth than a spiral bevel pinion, with the result that gear ratios of 60:1 and higher are feasible using a single set of hypoid gears. This style of gear is most common in motor vehicle drive trains, in concert with a differential. Whereas a regular (nonhypoid) ring-and-pinion gear set is suitable for many applications, it is not ideal for vehicle drive trains because it generates more noise and vibration than a hypoid does. Bringing hypoid gears to market for mass-production applications was an engineering improvement of the 1920s.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to design and implement a seventh-order polynomial function of transmission error (TE) for <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> with an aim to reduce the running vibration and noise of gear drive and improve the loaded distribution of the tooth. Based on the constraint conditions of predesigned seventh-order polynomial function curve and the theory of linear algebra, the polynomial coefficients of the seventh-order polynomial function of transmission error can be obtained. By applying a method named reverse tooth contact analysis, the modified roll coefficients as well as parts of machine-tool settings for the face-milling of <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> can be individually determined. Therefore, a predesigned seventh-order polynomial function of transmission error for <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> can be obtained by the modified roll with high-order coefficients, and comparisons of the seventh-order polynomial and parabolic functions of transmission error are also performed. The achievement of <b>spiral</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> with the seventh-order function of transmission error can be accomplished on a universal Cartesian-type hypoid gear generator or a numerically controlled cradle-style hypoid gear generator due to its simple generating motion of axes of the cradle and the work piece. The results of a numerical example show that the bending stresses of the tooth of seventh-order are less than those of a parabolic one, while the contact stresses remain almost equivalent...|$|R
