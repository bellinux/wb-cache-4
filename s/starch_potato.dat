40|$|AbstractPotato late blight {{caused by}} the oomycete Phytophthora infestans is a devastating disease of potato worldwide. Most of the potato cultivars grown in {{conventional}} agriculture are susceptible, or at best moderately resistant, and require frequent applications of fungicides to avoid heavy yield losses. In field trials spanning four years, we have investigated the effect of potassium phosphite, an inorganic salt on potato late blight. Potassium phosphite is known to induce defence responses in potato and to also have direct toxic effects on oomycetes, which in turn counteract late blight and tuber blight development. However, {{the use of this}} salt is not yet implemented and approved in European potato cultivation. We compared the effect of phosphite alone with fungicides currently used in Swedish potato cultivation. We also investigated the combined use of potassium phosphite and reduced doses of fungicides. Table potato cultivars and <b>starch</b> <b>potato</b> cultivars with different levels of resistance were used. We found that potassium phosphite in combination with reduced doses of fungicides results in the same level of protection as treatments with the recommended full dose of fungicides. These combined treatments reduce the need of traditional fungicides and may also decrease the selection pressure for fungicide resistance development in the pathogen. In relatively resistant <b>starch</b> <b>potato</b> cultivars using phosphite alone gave sufficient protection against late blight. Furthermore, in <b>starch</b> <b>potato</b> a combination of phosphite and fungicides at two-week intervals provided similar protection to weekly applications of fungicide at the recommended dose. Foliar treatment with phosphite also gave protection against tuber blight at similar levels to that of the best-performing fungicide. Our data suggests that potassium phosphite could be used in potato cultivation in temperate regions such as in Sweden, at least in combinations with reduced rates of fungicides. The implementation of the use of phosphite in practical potato crop protection as part of an IPM strategy is discussed.

40|$|Arable farming {{systems in}} the Netherlands are {{characterized}} by crop rotations in which potato, sugar beet, spring onion, winter wheat and spring barley {{are the most important}} crops. The objectives of this study were to decompose crop yield gaps within such rotations into efficiency, resource and technology yield gaps and to explain those yield gaps based on observed cropping frequencies and alternative farmers' objectives. Data from specialized Dutch arable farms between 2008 and 2012 were used. Production frontiers and efficiency yield gaps were estimated using the stochastic frontier framework. The resource yield gap was quantified through the estimation of highest farmers' yields (Y HF, average across farms with actual yields above the 90 th percentile). Crop model simulations and variety trials were compiled to assess climatic potential yields (Yp) and technology yield gaps. The contribution of crop area shares and farmers' objectives to actual yields were assessed using regression analysis and based on five different farm level indicators (N production, energy production, gross margin, nitrogen-use efficiency and labour use), respectively. The average yield gap per crop (as percentage of Yp which is given in parentheses) was: 29. 2 % (of 72. 6 t ha − 1) for ware potato, 39. 7 % (of 71. 6 t ha − 1) for <b>starch</b> <b>potato,</b> 26. 4 % (of 107. 1 t ha − 1) for sugar beet, 32. 3 % (of 88. 3 t ha − 1) for spring onion, 25. 2 % (of 12. 3 t ha − 1) for winter wheat and 37. 5 % (of 10. 4 t ha − 1) for spring barley. The efficiency yield gap ranged between 6. 6 % (<b>starch</b> <b>potato)</b> and 18. 1 % (spring onion) of Yp. The resource yield gap was lower than 10 % of Yp for all the crops and the technology yield gap ranged between 7. 1 % (ware potato) and 30. 7 % of Yp (<b>starch</b> <b>potato).</b> There were statistically significant effects of potato (positive quadratic) and onion (positive) area shares on ware potato, sugar beet and winter wheat yields, of sugar beet area share (positive quadratic) on winter wheat yield and of cereal area share (negative) on sugar beet and winter wheat yields. Farmers' objectives explain part of the variability observed in crop yields which were 7 – 24 %, 13 – 24 % and 12 – 32 % lower than Y HF, respectively, for gross margin maximising, labour minimising and N use efficiency maximising farms. In addition, there was a significant positive relationship between gross margin and the yield of ware potato, sugar beet and winter wheat. By contrast, no significant relationships were found between crop yields and NUE or labour use. We conclude that most of the yield gap is explained by the efficiency yield gap for ware potato and spring onion and by both the efficiency and technology yield gaps for sugar beet and cereals. The resource yield gap explains most of the yield gap of seed potato, and the technology yield gap of <b>starch</b> <b>potato.</b> The results regarding the effects of cropping frequency and crop rotations to crop yields are not very conclusive which suggest that agronomic principles become less evident at 'systems level’ given the number of interacting factors at crop rotation level. Finally, although N and energy production are lower for gross margin maximising farms, most crop yields are not significantly different between farms with the highest N and energy production compared to farms performing best on economic (gross margin) objectives. </p...|$|E

The inhalatory exposure of the application workers was estimated from biological monitoring data. All workers collected urine and serum samples before, during, and after the fumigation season for monitoring of variables for kidney and liver function. Renal effect variables were alanine aminopeptidase (AAP), N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), retinol binding protein (RBP), and albumin (ALB) in urine, and β 2 -microglobulin (β 2 M-S) and creatinine in serum (Creat-S). Liver variables were alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TBIL) in serum and the urinary ratio of 6 -β-hydroxycortisol to free cortisol (βOHC/COR).  RESULTS—The geometric mean exposure of the application workers was 2. 7  mg/m 3 (8  hour time weighted average (8  hour TWA)); range 0. 1 - 9. 5 mg/m 3.

Samples with different levels of <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> (as 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 %) with constant amount of PE-g-MA as 5 % were prepared. In all samples amount of compatibilizer are the same. The effect of <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> content on the thermal properties of blend studied with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Result show with increasing <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> content, crystallization decreased. The biodegradation of blends was studied with soil burial and exposure to mould growth. Biodegradation determined by weight lose, the change in tensile properties of the sheets and mould growth. The results showed that with increasing <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> content biodegradability of blends increased. Biodegradation of the samples due to soil burial after 8 months revealed that {{the weight of the}} blends was decreased by increasing the <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> level...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of the addition of different amount of native <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> on both the rheological properties and consolidation of the dispersed hydroxyapatite powder in aqueous media were thoroughly investigated. The amount of native <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> addition has ranged from 10 to 40 vol. %. The {{results indicated that the}} rheological properties of the hydroxyapatite suspension were improved with addition of <b>potato</b> <b>starch.</b> The <b>potato</b> <b>starch</b> and HA particulates were found to be homogeneously distributed through SEM investigation. The relative density and the compressive strength of the consolidated slurries were increased with the increase of the starch amount till 30 vol. % addition and then decreased thereafter. Porous 3 D-HA sample would produce from the sintering of green sample via consolidation technique at 1300 °C for 2 h. The porous sample was found to possess apparent porosity of about 50 % with sufficient compressive strength...|$|R
