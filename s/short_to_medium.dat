He instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment.

For a typical [...]338 Lapua Magnum rifle for example, shooting standard 16.2 gram (250 gr) Lapua Scenar GB488 bullets at 905 m/s (2969 ft/s) muzzle velocity, field testing of the software should be done at ≈ 1200-1300 meters (1312 - 1422 yd) under International Standard Atmosphere sea level conditions (air density ρ = 1.225 kg/m³). To check how well the software predicts the trajectory at <b>shorter</b> <b>to</b> <b>medium</b> range, field tests at 20, 40 and 60% of the supersonic range have to be conducted. At those <b>shorter</b> <b>to</b> <b>medium</b> ranges, transonic problems and hence unbehaved bullet flight should not occur, and the BC {{is less likely to}} be transient. Testing the predictive qualities of software at (extreme) long ranges is expensive because it consumes ammunition; the actual muzzle velocity of all shots fired must be measured {{to be able to make}} statistically dependable statements.

40|$|Patellofemoral instability, also {{referred}} to as episodic patella dislocation (EPD), occurs at an incidence of 7 per 100, 000 people across all age groups. Many anatomical factors are known to contribute to EPD. The most common of these are trochlea dysplasia and patella alta. Patella alta is increasingly being recognized as a main contributing factor in EPD. This morphologic abnormality exists when the patella is located in an exaggerated proximal position such that it does not engage in the trochlea appropriately. The exact biomechanical mechanism that links patella alta to EPD is unclear, but {{it is likely to be}} multifactorial. A delay in patellofemoral contact and engagement predisposes to patella dislocation and potentially increased rates of patellofemoral osteoarthritis. Surgical management of patella alta in the setting of EPD aims to restore patella height and patella tendon length back to normal indices. The goal is to improve patellofemoral engagement and prevent further patella dislocations. The recommended procedures include a distalizing tibial tubercle osteotomy and patella tendon tenodesis, which are frequently combined with other procedures to stabilize the patella.
