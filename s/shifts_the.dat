5|$|Carpentier {{reduces the}} {{individuality}} of the characters, enhancing {{the notion of}} humanity, keeping {{in line with the}} theme of history as a repetition of patterns regardless of who is in power. The simultaneous presence of fact and fiction and the cycle of reversal of fortunes presents characters as functional variants of each other. Through frequent use of metonymy, whereby a part replaces a whole, for example, referring to soldiers as uniformes (uniforms), Carpentier <b>shifts</b> <b>the</b> focus from individuals to the collective.|$|E

50|$|ALU shift {{operations}} cause operand A (or B) {{to shift}} {{left or right}} (depending on the opcode) and <b>the</b> <b>shifted</b> operand appears at Y. Simple ALUs typically can <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> operand by only one bit position, whereas more complex ALUs employ barrel shifters {{that allow them to}} <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> operand by an arbitrary number of bits in one operation. In all single-bit <b>shift</b> operations, <b>the</b> bit <b>shifted</b> out of <b>the</b> operand appears on carry-out; the value of <b>the</b> bit <b>shifted</b> into <b>the</b> operand depends on <b>the</b> type of <b>shift.</b>|$|R

5|$|Since {{producers}} {{search for}} food and scroungers wait for opportunities to join, prey crypsis imposes a producer specific cost that <b>shifts</b> <b>the</b> producer scrounger equilibria towards more scrounging. Prey crypsis resulted in increased latency to eat the seed and increased number of detection errors. Moreover, {{the presence of a}} competitor negatively affected foraging efficiency under cyptic backgrounds. The foraging efficiency of individuals that had previously foraged with a competitor on cryptic seeds remained low even after the competitor had been removed. Thus, the costs of foraging on cryptic prey may be greater for social foragers than for solitary foragers.|$|E
5|$|The not-guilty verdict led to {{widespread}} dismay, and, as a result, the U.S. Congress {{and a number}} of states rewrote laws regarding the insanity defense. The old Model Penal Code test was replaced by a test that <b>shifts</b> <b>the</b> burden of proof regarding a defendant's sanity from the prosecution to the defendant. Three states have abolished the defense altogether.|$|E

50|$|The {{addition}} of a ball-and-spring-type detent on <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> sleeve and detents on <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> rail assists <b>the</b> driver in <b>shifting</b> quicker. <b>The</b> detent raises the force required to move <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> lever which prevents excess movement of the shifter by the driver, and reduces the chance of double bump. Tension between <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> sleeve and <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> rail also prevents the sleeve from vibrating while in gear.|$|R
5|$|Cubs start {{following}} their mothers at six weeks. The mother frequently <b>shifts</b> <b>the</b> cubs to new locations. A study of play behaviour of cheetah cubs showed that cubs tend to play after nursing or {{while they are}} on the move with their mothers. Play involves plenty of agility; attacks are seldom lethal. Playing cubs stay near their mothers. The study further revealed that while the cubs showed improvement in catching each other as they grew up, the ability to crouch and hide did not develop remarkably. Thus, it was suggested that play helps develop only certain aspects of predator defence. Weaning occurs at three to six months of age. The mother brings kills to her cubs; the cubs might purr as the mother licks them clean after the meal. Cubs as young as six months try to capture small prey like hares and juvenile gazelles. However, they may have to wait until as long as 15 months of age to make a successful kill on their own.|$|E

Also on 1 April, Plan Alamo was implemented to utilize {{and defend the}} DAO compound and its annex as an evacuee holding area, intended to care for 1,500 evacuees for five days. By 16 April, Alamo was complete: water, C-rations, petroleum, oil and lubricants had been stockpiled, backup electricity generators had been installed, sanitary facilities were completed, and concertina wire protected the perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the episode}} also {{focused on the}} divorce's effects on Milhouse {{and there was a}} subplot that {{involved}} Bart being jealous of Milhouse and wishing that Marge and Homer would also separate. Several scenes were written and animated for the episode, but ultimately they were cut because the script was very long. The third act of the episode <b>shifts</b> <b>the</b> focus from the Van Houtens to Homer and Marge because the writers felt that tertiary characters could not carry an audience's interest for an entire episode. Bill Oakley has said that he felt the episode would have failed had they stuck with the Van Houtens for the third act and most of the other writers also felt that it was the right move.|$|E

5|$|He {{returns to}} the {{observation}} room and finds the letter he'd written to Amanda, in which he'd used his knowledge of her role in Jill's miscarriage to blackmail her into killing Lynn Denlon. The letter was found by Pamela and given to Jill, who uses it to ambush Hoffman as William reaches {{the end of his}} path with one second left, finding himself between the cages. It is revealed that Pamela is his sister, while Tara and Brent are Harold's family. Tara is informed by a videotape of Kramer that she can either kill William or free him using the switch; when she is unable to make a decision, Brent angrily <b>shifts</b> <b>the</b> switch and a bed of needles swings down and injects William's body with the acid, killing him. Jill restrains Hoffman and locks a new reverse bear trap to his head. She shows him the sixth envelope, which contains his photo, and leaves him with 45 seconds but no key. Hoffman escapes by breaking his hand and jamming the trap as it activates, and he pulls his head free, ripping open his cheek.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of urban areasin particular Antananarivohave been {{hardest hit by}} economic downturns and economic policy <b>shifts.</b> <b>The</b> national economic crisis in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and the World Bank's imposition of a structural adjustment program lowered living standards for the average resident of the city. The end of state subsidies, rapid inflation, higher taxes, widespread impoverishment {{and the decline of}} the middle class were especially evident in Antananarivo, as was the growing wealth of a tiny political and economic elite in the city. In 2007, two thirds of Antananarivo residents had access to electricity, while ten percent of households owned a scooter, car or other motor vehicle. Running water was installed in fewer than 25 percent of homes, small restaurants and businesses in 2007, necessitating the collection of water from household wells or neighborhood pumps and the use of outdoor pit toilets detached from the main building. In 2007, 60 percent of households were using shared public latrines. Most homes use charcoal for daily cooking; stocks of charcoal and rice are kept in the kitchen. The average city household spends just under half of its budget on food. Owing to its increasingly high cost, consumption of meat by city residents has sharply declined since the 1970s; the urban poor eat meat on holidays only once or twice a year.|$|E
