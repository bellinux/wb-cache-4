5|$|Work on {{the second}} bridge {{commenced}} on 8 June 1965, increasing {{the height and width}} in accordance with Ministry of Transport requirements. Around this time, the station itself was upgraded: the platforms were demolished and replaced, and new waiting shelters were erected. A new booking office, facing Station Road and approached by a flight of stairs, was built alongside a new booking lobby, toilets and <b>staff</b> <b>accommodation.</b> New entrances to the platforms were built, and the entire station was installed with electric lighting. Station Road was significantly widened and rerouted slightly in 1967 in a further attempt to accommodate increasing traffic.|$|E
5|$|To {{pay for the}} {{demolition}} of the 1960s extension, the consent application indicated that the University planned to sell off {{another part of the}} current South Stoneham estate, currently occupied by a tennis court and caretakers' house, for a residential scheme comprising 65 flats. In addition, to replace the student accommodation that {{the demolition}} would remove, the plan was for another building containing 64 student flats plus <b>staff</b> <b>accommodation</b> to be constructed on {{the eastern part of the}} site. The plan also indicated the provision of better access to the site including new footpaths alongside Monks Brook and the River Itchen as well as the possibility of handing part of the site to the city council as a nature conservation area. The University also planned a series of repairs and alterations to the original house.|$|E

5|$|Fort Yellowstone was a U.S. Army fort, {{established}} in 1891 at Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone was designated in 1872 but the Interior Department {{was unable to}} effectively manage the park. Administration {{was transferred to the}} War Department in August 1886 and General Philip Sheridan sent a company of cavalry to Mammoth Hot Springs to build a cavalry post. The army originally called the post Camp Sheridan in honor of General Sheridan but the name was changed to Fort Yellowstone in 1891 when construction of the permanent fort commenced. The army administered the park until 1918 when it was transferred to the newly created National Park Service.

25|$|In its {{days as a}} {{boarding}} school pupils at Exhall Grange were placed into one of six houses, each of which had approximately 50 boarding and day pupils {{ranging in age from}} 5 to 18. The school was unusual in that all meals were taken in houses, as opposed to a central dining system. The boys' houses were named Canterbury, Lancaster, Warwick and Windsor. The girls' houses were Avon and Kenilworth. A seventh house, York House, was originally also a boys' house, but was closed as part of the rebuilding logistics, and the boys were distributed between the remaining four. An eighth house, Malvern, was used for <b>staff</b> <b>accommodation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Servants' {{quarters}} {{are those}} parts of a building, traditionally in a private house, which contain the domestic offices and <b>staff</b> <b>accommodation.</b> From the late 17th century until the early 20th century, they were a common feature in many large houses. Sometimes they {{are an integral part}} of a smaller house—in the basements and attics, especially in a town house, while in larger houses they are often a purpose-built adjacent wing or block. In architectural descriptions and guidebooks of stately homes, the servants' quarters are frequently overlooked, yet they form an important piece of social history, often as interesting as the principal part of the house itself.|$|E
25|$|At the University of Sydney, Blacket {{built the}} Anglican St. Paul's College and {{supervised}} {{the building of}} the Catholic College of St John's after the resignation of its designer William Wardell. Insofar as the building was completed, he was faithful to Wardell's design, but he omitted several features, such as the western cloister, for lack of funds. In 1881, Blacket designed the Clarke Buildings of Trinity College, a residential college affiliated with the University of Melbourne. These residential buildings were executed in brick, with decorative stone features and carved columns. He later also added a kitchen and <b>staff</b> <b>accommodation</b> block. A design for a chapel at the College was not proceeded with. The Clarke Buildings were extended and completed and Arthur Blacket in 1888.|$|E
50|$|Initially {{the mine}} was {{scheduled}} to close in 2001, however due to improved mining techniques, the mine life was extended one year to 2002. Reclamation procedures following {{the closure of the}} Polaris mine set a new standard for mine closure in the territory of Nunavut. Reclamation of the mine site began while the mine was still operating, this work was planned to ensure it would not have an adverse effect on the mining operation (such as removal of unused buildings). Cominco intended to bury most of the buildings and materials in a nearby quarry, with the permafrost preventing contamination. Cominco offered the <b>staff</b> <b>accommodations</b> to the federal government for use as a penal colony on the island. Household items were offered to residents of nearby Inuit communities. Cleanup of the Polaris mine site took two years, with environmental monitoring until 2011.|$|R

25|$|Vale Royal was {{purchased}} by ICI in 1947. The chemical company initially used the abbey as <b>staff</b> <b>accommodation</b> and then, from 1954 to 1961, as the headquarters for its Alkali Division. ICI moved out in 1961 and for some years the future of Vale Royal was in doubt. There were abortive schemes to use the abbey as a health centre, a country club, a school and even a prison (this latter proposal was resisted by local inhabitants as strongly, though less violently, as the original foundation of the abbey had been, and did not occur). In 1977, the abbey {{was made into a}} residential care home for people with learning difficulties. Since 1998, Vale Royal has been home to a private golf club. In addition to use by the members, the house is available for weddings and corporate and private events.|$|E
25|$|While <b>staff</b> <b>accommodation</b> {{continues}} to be built for hotels and similar buildings, in domestic use it has declined along with the numbers of staff kept. This major decline began in Europe following World War I. In Europe many owners of large mansions have {{gone so far as}} to demolish whole service wings. Queen Elizabeth II made this decision at Sandringham House in the 1980s, while at West Wycombe Park the roofless former service wing now contains a garden. In many other houses open to the public the former servants' domains are now restaurants, shops and offices, while the bedrooms are let to holiday makers and tourists. Where staff are retained in private houses, they are more likely to live in purpose-built apartments created from the former servants' quarters, or as at Woburn Abbey converted from former stables; at Woburn the servants' attic bedrooms have now been altered to provide more spacious bedrooms for the use of the owners, thus providing a retreat and privacy from the paying public viewing the rooms below.|$|E

40|$|Background : It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that people with intellectual disability (ID) might {{be similar to the}} general population in the way they respond to significant life events. Some preliminary findings have demonstrated that adults with ID who have experienced recent life events have an increased probability of having psychiatric problems. The aims of the present study were to determine whether previous findings can be replicated, and to examine the influence of additional diagnoses associated with ID on the strength of relationships between life event frequency and psychiatric problems. Methods : Adults with ID (n = 624), living either in <b>staffed</b> community <b>accommodation</b> or in family or foster homes, were assessed on the Developmental Behaviour Checklist for Adults (DBC-A) and a 37 -item life events checklist. Carers who knew the person well acted as proxy informants. Results : People living in <b>staffed</b> <b>accommodation</b> experienced more life events than people living with natural or foster families. Life event frequency predicted DBC-A total score, five of six sub-scale scores, and caseness status, after significant demographic factors were taken into account. However, the strength of correlations between life event frequency and DBC-A total score varied among sub-groups identified by type of developmental disability and level of ID. Conclusions : Weak but significant associations between emotional and behavioural problems and life events experienced by adults with ID were demonstrated, but it was also shown that the strength of such associations varies among sub-groups of this heterogeneous population. Future research needs to take account of the circumstances surrounding the life changes, the period of time over which changes might have taken place, and the meaning that the person might attach to the changes. Research into the causal relationship between exposure to life events and the onset of psychiatric problems is also warranted. <br /...|$|R
