40|$|<b>Staphylococcal</b> <b>food</b> {{poisoning}} {{represents the}} most prevalent foodborne intoxication worldwide. It is caused by oral intake of enterotoxins preformed by Staphylococcus aureus in food. The relevance of newly described enterotoxins in outbreaks of <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>food</b> poisoning is controversially discussed. Although the staphylococcal enterotoxins SEG, SEI, SEM, SEN, and SEO elicit emesis in a monkey feeding assay, {{there has been no}} conclusive proof of their emetic activity in humans. In this study, we provide further evidence suggesting that one of these enterotoxins or a combination of SEG, SEI, SEM, SEN, and SEO cause <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>food</b> poisoning. We investigated two outbreaks registered with the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, in which only Staphylococcus aureus strains harboring the egc cluster, including seg, sei, sem, sen, and seo linked to typical signs of <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>food</b> poisoning were isolated. The outbreaks were caused by consumption of raw goat cheese and semi-hard goat cheese, and were linked to strains assigned to CC 45 (agr type I) and CC 9 (agr type II), respectively. These outbreaks provide further evidence that newly-described staphylococcal enterotoxins are likely to cause <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>food</b> poisoning in humans...|$|R
40|$|<b>Staphylococcal</b> <b>food</b> {{poisoning}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common food-borne diseases and results from the ingestion of staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) preformed in food by enterotoxigenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus. To date, more than 20 SEs have been described: SEA to SElV. All SEs have superantigenic activity whereas only a few have been proved to be emetic, representing a potential hazard for consumers. Characterization of <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>food</b> poisoning outbreaks (SFPOs) has considerably progressed compared to 80 years ago, when staphylococci were simply enumerated and only five enterotoxins were known for qualitative detection. Today, SFPOs can be characterized by a number of approaches, such as the identification of S. aureus biovars, PCR and RT-PCR methods to identify the se genes involved, immunodetection of specific SEs, and absolute quantification by mass spectrometry. An integrated gene-to-protein approach for characterizing <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>food</b> poisoning is advocated...|$|R
40|$|<b>Staphylococcal</b> <b>food</b> {{poisoning}} {{is caused}} by ingestion of enterotoxins preformed in the food contaminated essentially through human manipulation or raw material obtained from animals. Although coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus is the main agent responsible for <b>food</b> <b>intoxication,</b> some researches emphasise that coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are able to produce staphylococcal enterotoxins and may be a potential cause of food poisoning. In the present study CNS were isolated from foods and the toxigenic capacity of the strains determined. A total of 88 food samples were analysed and 22. 7 % were positive for CNS strains. Staphylococcal counts ranged from 3. 0 x 10 Â² to 1. 4 x 10 (6) CFU/g or mL of food examined. S. epidermidis predominated among the isolates (40 %). Further isolates included S. xylosus (20 %), S. warneri (20 %), S. saccharolyticus (15 %), and S. hominis (5 %). Four isolates were positive for enterotoxin genes, as detected by polymerase chain reaction, with sea being the predominant gene. Although no enterotoxin production was detected by the reverse passive latex agglutination method, the data showed that the toxigenic capacity of CNS should not be ignored, requiring investigation of this group of microorganisms in food...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is an {{important}} aetiological agent of <b>food</b> <b>intoxications</b> in the European Union as it can cause gastro-enteritis through the production of various staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) in foods. Reported enterotoxin dose levels causing food-borne illness are scarce and varying. Three food poisoning outbreaks due to enterotoxin-producing S. aureus strains which occurred in 2013 in Belgium are described. The outbreaks occurred in an elderly home, at a barbecue event and in a kindergarten and involved 28, 18, and six cases, respectively. Various food leftovers contained coagulase positive staphylococci (CPS). Low levels of staphylococcal enterotoxins ranging between 0. 015 ng/g and 0. 019 ng/g for enterotoxin A (SEA), and corresponding to 0. 132 ng/g for SEC were quantified in the food leftovers {{for two of the}} reported outbreaks. Molecular typing of human and food isolates using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and enterotoxin gene typing, confirmed the link between patients and the suspected foodstuffs. This also demonstrated the high diversity of CPS isolates both in the cases and in healthy persons carrying enterotoxin genes encoding emetic SEs for which no detection methods currently exist. For one outbreak, the investigation pointed out to the food handler who transmitted the outbreak strain to the food.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus coagulase type VII strains {{have been}} the strains most {{frequently}} isolated from <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>food</b> poisoning outbreaks in Tokyo, Japan. We applied pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of chromosomal DNA digested with SmaI to characterize 129 coagulase type VII strains. These were isolated from 129 cases occurring in outbreaks in 35 districts during a 16 -year period (1980 â 1995). The 129 outbreak strains were classified into three types, designated A (n = 115), B (n = 10), and C (n = 4). Types A and C were further divided into 33 (A 1 to A 33) and 4 (C 1 to C 4) subtypes, respectively. Strains of the same subtypes were isolated from food poisoning cases in the same districts at time intervals of 1 or 2 to 5 years. PFGE typing {{appears to be a}} useful method for subdividing strains of S. aureus coagulase type VII.

40|$|The {{staphylococcal enterotoxins}} (SEs) are {{secreted}} by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus {{and are the}} most common causative agent in <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>food</b> poisoning. The <b>staphylococcal</b> enterotoxin A (SEA) has been associated with large <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>food</b> poisoning outbreaks, but newer identified SEs, like staphylococcal enterotoxin H (SEH) has recently been shown to be present at similar levels as SEA in food poisoning outbreaks. Thus, we set out to investigate the thermo-stability of the three-dimensional structures of SEA, SEH and staphylococcal enterotoxin E (SEE), since heat inactivation is a common method to inactivate toxins during food processing. Interestingly, the investigated toxins behaved distinctly different upon heating. SEA and SEE were more stable at slightly acidic pH values, while SEH adopted an extremely stable structure at neutral pH, with almost no effects on secondary structural elements upon heating to 95 Â°C, and with reversible formation of tertiary structure upon subsequent cooling to room temperature. Taken together, the data suggests that the family of staphylococcal enterotoxins have different ability to withstand heat, and thus the exact profile of heat inactivation for all SEs causing food poisoning needs to be considered to improve food safety...|$|R

40|$|The International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods (ICMSF) has {{recently}} proposed a scheme {{for the management}} of microbial hazards for foods that involves the concept of food safety objectives (FSOs). FSOs are intended to specify the maximum levels of hazardous agents required to meet a given public health goal. This scheme offers flexibility for the food industry in terms of allowing the use of alternative but equivalent means for achieving a given FSO. This paper illustrates the application of the ICMSF model via the analysis of the microbiological hazard of Staphylococcus aureus in cream- lled baked goods. Cream-filled baked goods have a notorious history as vehicles for foodborne illness, particularly <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>food</b> poisoning.
