500|$|In 1860, the Highland Railway {{decided to}} {{construct}} a railway line going from Inverness through Easter Ross. The line was completed by 1862, and the following year, on 23 May 1863, Evanton gained its own railway station. However, the station was called Novar, and was not renamed [...] "Evanton" [...] until 1937. Sadly for the local economy, the station was closed in June 1960. The platforms remain there to this day, but the <b>signal</b> <b>posts</b> have been destroyed. The Inverness to Thurso railway line, known today as [...] "Far North Line", still passes by the seaward side of the town, and the trains can still be heard from a great distance. The nearest train station is Alness.|$|E
2500|$|Melton {{manufactured}} ferro-concrete fence posts, {{then from}} 1915, <b>signal</b> <b>posts.</b> During World War I, Marriott {{was asked by}} the Government to develop building blocks for postwar housing (as there has been bombing). Although concrete had been used before on the railways, William mass-produced it and made everything out of concrete. There were many patents produced relating to developments in concrete sleepers, chairs and <b>signal</b> <b>posts.</b> When the original Holt station burnt down, Melton concrete works produced a new concrete station. Today there are still many examples of the concrete products, including the lamp posts at Sheringham station on the North Norfolk Railway and the station sign at West Runton railway station. Cromer signal box base is made of Melton concrete. After 1916, the M used the concrete blocks for box construction, however only Cromer Beach was built to this design. Gedney railway station ...|$|E
2500|$|On 13 June Scout and her sister-ship [...] chased three vessels {{into the}} Barbate river. Raitt sent boats from both Scout and Redwing {{to destroy the}} vessels, which {{consisted}} of a Spanish privateer, a Letter of Marque and a felucca The Spanish privateer was the De Bonne Vassallio, of one 24-pounder and two 6-pounder guns. She had a crew of 42 men, all but four of whom escaped ashore. The only British casualty was one man whom a splinter injured when the privateer blew up. The boarding party also captured two <b>signal</b> <b>posts,</b> together with their flags.|$|E
50|$|On 19 November 1926, {{a private}} owner wagon disintegrated, derailing the train {{that it was}} part of. A <b>signal</b> <b>post</b> was {{partially}} brought down, obstructing an adjacent line. An express passenger train had the sides of its carriages ripped open by the <b>signal</b> <b>post.</b> Eleven people were killed.|$|R

60|$|The English watched Buonaparte {{in these}} preparations, and Buonaparte watched the English. At the {{distance}} of Boulogne details were lost, but we were impressed on fine days by the novel sight of a huge army moving and twinkling like a school of mackerel under the rays of the sun. The regular way of passing an afternoon in the coast towns was to stroll up to the <b>signal</b> <b>posts</b> and chat with the lieutenant on duty there about the latest inimical object seen at sea. About once a week there appeared in the newspapers either a paragraph concerning some adventurous English gentleman who had sailed out in a pleasure-boat till he lay near enough to Boulogne to see Buonaparte standing on the heights among his marshals; or else some lines about a mysterious stranger with a foreign accent, who, after collecting a vast deal of information on our resources, had hired a boat at a southern port, and vanished with it towards France before his intention could be divined.|$|E
50|$|Materials {{that were}} {{commonly}} used to make <b>signal</b> <b>posts</b> for semaphore signals included timber, lattice steel, tubular steel and concrete. The Southern Railway in Great Britain frequently made use of old rail for <b>signal</b> <b>posts.</b>|$|E

Although the Ordnance Survey map circa 1880 does not show the railway itself, it does show two tunnels and two <b>signal</b> <b>posts.</b>|$|E
50|$|Further {{alterations}} {{occurred in}} May 1991, including {{the removal of}} a number of sidings, crossovers, disc signals and <b>signal</b> <b>posts,</b> and the sleeving {{of a number of}} levers.

50|$|Nothing {{remains of}} the station today; the site is marked only by some old {{semaphore}} <b>signal</b> <b>posts,</b> some slates and a platelayers' hut. The station {{was the only one}} on the line built of blue bricks. The surrounds were not developed {{at the time of the}} station's existence so having fulfilled its political function it closed, in 1859.|$|E
50|$|The OS maps of 1896 and 1910 show a {{substantial}} infrastructure {{with a double}} track mainline and four sidings running off to a loading dock and a goods shed with a crane, a signal box {{at the far end}} of the southern end of the eastern platform, <b>signal</b> <b>posts,</b> weighing machine, pedestrian overbridge and several platform buildings. In 1946 the main platform buildings were still substantially intact.|$|E

A couple of sidings appear to end in a small goods shed. In 1903 the layout is {{the same with the}} addition of several small buildings. The station used to carry a significant amount of timber traffic originating in the surrounding forests.|$|E
50|$|Bolsters are baulks {{of timber}} fixed across the bed. The bed is thus not flat, but most loads such as girders, rails, timber lengths, <b>signal</b> <b>posts</b> etc are stiff {{enough that they}} only need to be {{supported}} at intervals, not continuously across a flat planked bed. The space between baulks allows room for tie-down chains or lifting strops, making this bolster design easier to work with than a completely flat bed.|$|E
50|$|Fixed {{communication}} at trackside {{is provided}} by telephone. These are primarily provided for signallers to communicate with train crew, via telephones mounted on <b>signal</b> <b>posts,</b> and with the public through telephones located at level crossings.GAI-Tronics provides many of the telephones sited on trackside and at level crossings. They also provide Public Access Help Points on platforms and stations to provide passengers with easy access to Information and Emergency control centres.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 November 1926, {{a private}} owner wagon of a goods train {{disintegrated}} near [...] station, Yorkshire, derailing the goods train {{that it was}} part of. A <b>signal</b> <b>post</b> was partially knocked over, obstructing the adjacent line. An express passenger train had the sides of its carriages ripped open by the <b>signal</b> <b>post,</b> killing eleven people. A direct consequence of this accident was that private owner wagons had to be registered with railway companies before {{they were allowed to}} run on main lines. They were also subject to a detailed inspection every ten years.|$|R
