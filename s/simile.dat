5|$|In the {{cultures}} of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, animal stereotypes grew until {{by the time of}} Virgil, animal epithets could be applied to anything from an abstract concept like love or fear, to a whole civilisation. An author could use an animal's name to emphasise a theme or to provide an overview of a complex epic tale. For example, Homer uses animal similes in the Iliad and the Odyssey, where the lion symbolises qualities such as bravery. This leads up to the lion <b>simile</b> {{at the end of the}} Odyssey, where in Book 22 Odysseus kills all Penelope's suitors. In the Iliad, Homer compares the Trojans to stridulating grasshoppers, which the classicist Gordon Lindsay Campbell believes to imply that they make a lot of noise but are weaker and less determined than they think. In the Aeneid, Book 4, Virgil compares the world of Dido, queen of Carthage, with a colony of ants. Campbell argues that Dido's people are hardworking, strong, unfailingly loyal, organised, and self-regulating: just the sort of world that the hero Aeneas would like to create. But, Campbell argues, the <b>simile</b> also suggests that Carthage's civilisation is fragile and insignificant, and could readily be destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Poetry uses {{forms and}} {{conventions}} to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly figures of speech such as metaphor, <b>simile</b> and metonymy create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.|$|E

The use of a dragon eating a man is to symbolise former member Hester being consumed by depression, symbolised by the dragon being blue, and this brought his time on earth to an early end. The cover art is almost completely composed of newspaper cuttings collaged together, even the image of the man and the dragon are newspaper cuttings which Seymour painted onto.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the meaning of}} like as used in <b>similes</b> {{in the light of}} relevance theory. <b>Similes,</b> even though superficially indistinguishable from literal comparisons, are found to be closer to metaphors. Therefore, it is proposed that like in <b>similes</b> is different from like employed in literal comparisons. In particular, it is claimed that, contrary to the current relevance-theoretic position on this issue, like in <b>similes</b> introduces an ad hoc concept. This like is seen as both conceptual and procedural and, as such, it is distinct from both the conceptual like used in literal comparisons and the procedural like functioning as a pragmatic marker. Such a solution accounts for the similarities and differences between <b>similes,</b> metaphors and literal comparisons...|$|R

5|$|As per Tulsidas, the Nirguna Brahman (quality-less impersonal absolute) and Saguna Brahman (personal God with qualities) {{are one and}} the same. Both, Saguna (qualified Brahman) and Aguna (or Nirguna - {{unqualified}} Brahman) are Akath (unspeakable), Agaadh (unfathomable), Anaadi (without beginning, {{in existence}} since eternity) and Anupa (without parallel) (अगुन सगुन दुइ ब्रह्म सरूपा। अकथ अगाध अनादि अनूपा॥). It is the devotion (Bhakti) of the devotee that forces the Nirguna Brahman which is quality-less, formless, invisible and unborn, to become Saguna Brahman with qualities. Tulsidas gives the example of water, snow and hail to explain this – the substance is the same in all three, but the same formless water solidifies to become hail or a mountain of snow – both of which have a form. Tulsidas also gives the <b>simile</b> of a lake – the Nirguna Brahman is like the lake with just water, while the Saguna Brahman is a lake resplendent with blooming lotuses. In the Uttar Kand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas describes in detail a debate between Kakbhushundi and Lomasa about whether God is Nirguna (as argued by Lomasa adhering to monism) or Saguna (as argued by Kakbhushundi adhering to dualism). Kakbhushundi repeatedly refutes all the arguments of Lomasa, to the point when Lomasa becomes angry and curses Kakbhushundi to be a crow. Lomasa repents later when Kakbhushundi happily accepts the curse but refuses to give up the Bhakti of Rama, the Saguna Brahman. Though Tulsidas holds both aspects of God to be equal, he favours the qualified Saguna aspect and the devotees of the highest category in the Ramcharitmanas repeatedly ask for the qualified Saguna aspect of Rama to dwell in their mind. Some authors contend from a few couplets in Ramcharitmanas and Vinay Patrika that Tulsidas has vigorously contradicted the denial of Avatar by Kabir. In several of his works, Kabir had said that the actual Rama is not the son of Dasharatha. In the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas, Shiva tells Parvati – those who say that the Rama whom the Vedas sing of and whom the sages contemplate on is different from the Rama of Raghu's race are possessed by the devil of delusion and do not know the difference between truth and falsehood. However, such allusions are based on interpretations of the text and do not hold much water when considered in the context of Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas, in none of his works, has ever mentioned Kabir.|$|E

40|$|The present thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>similes</b> within the Sanskrit Epics. Acknowledging the fact that, {{as a product of}} an oral tradition, both Epics display upamas which do not fulfil any specific function within the narrative, but are merely employed as “line-fillers”, this research investigates <b>similes</b> employed with a specific purpose within the texts. The methodology employed is the contextual analysis of passages drawn from both Epics: <b>similes</b> occurring within each section are translated and taken into account in the immediate context in which they occur. The current research suggests the following arguments: · That the range of <b>similes</b> employed within a passage is chosen according to the subject-matter of the passage, thus implying a connection between the subjectmatter and the ranges of upamanas employed. · That the <b>similes</b> often fulfil more than one purpose at a time: a secondary function often occurs when <b>similes</b> appear in sequences. · That each Epic displays comparisons whose function is specific to that Epic. · That Mahabharata and Ramayaoa display comparisons fulfilling a similar function when occurring in similar contexts. Comparisons are generally employed by the bard in order to draw the audience's focus on a particular moment within the narrative: the analysis of similarities and differences between the function of comparisons featured in each Epic suggests a more central role of <b>similes</b> within the non-verbal dialogue between the bard and the audience...|$|R

25|$|As {{with other}} {{classical}} Latin poetry, the meter {{is based on}} the length of syllables rather than the stress, though the interplay of meter and stress is also important. Virgil also incorporated such poetic devices as alliteration, onomatopoeia, synecdoche, and assonance. Furthermore, he uses personification, metaphor and <b>simile</b> in his work, usually to add drama and tension to the scene. An example of a <b>simile</b> can be found in book II when Aeneas is compared to a shepherd who stood on the high top of a rock unaware {{of what is going on}} around him. It can be seen that just as the shepherd is a protector of his sheep, so too is Aeneas to his people.|$|E

25|$|Fuller {{states that}} in the Nikayas, right-view {{includes}} non-dependence on knowledge and views, and mentions the Buddha's <b>simile</b> of his dhamma as a raft that must be abandoned.

In his view, both texts exhibit this particular approach not as an attack on practice or knowledge, but to point out that attachment to the path is destructive. Similarly, the text's treatment of concentration meditation is intended to warn against attachment to insight, and communicate that insight into the nature of things necessarily involves a calm mind.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Are there {{possible}} {{benefits to}} be gained from emulating the human way (of thought and language) with a machine way? This article outlines the concepts of <b>similes</b> and metaphors. This article aims to emphasise that <b>similes</b> and metaphors can be utilised to help understand and extract useful information from spatial data. As <b>similes</b> and metaphors are utilised in human language and understandings it may also be efficacious for spatial domains, in that it may inform and allow us to understand spatial complexities. <b>Similes</b> and metaphors are the verbal expressions of similarity. This article couches <b>similes</b> and metaphors in our spatial language (verbal expressions) as spatial similarity. The author realises that spatial similarity is just one subset of our spatial cognition ability. The general concept outlined in this article is that spatial similarity is a generative technique to analyse the cached information inherent in spatial sciences. This similarity technique is utilised to group natural kinds that manifest similar amenities in complex environments. If we then know or understand one spatial entity in this natural group (s 1) then we might understand other entities within that same natural group (s 1) from the complex environment. 1...|$|R

40|$|Many figurative {{expressions}} {{are fully}} conventionalized in everyday speech. Regarding the neural basis of figurative language processing, research has predominantly focused on metaphoric expressions in minimal semantic context. It remains unclear in how far metaphoric expressions during continuous text comprehension activate similar neural networks as isolated metaphors. We therefore investigated {{the processing of}} <b>similes</b> (figurative language, e. g. He smokes like a chimney!) occurring in a short story. Sixteen healthy, male, native German speakers listened to <b>similes</b> that came about naturally in a short story, while blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) responses were measured with {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). For the event-related analysis, <b>similes</b> were contrasted with non-figurative control sentences. The stimuli differed with respect to figurativeness, while they were matched for frequency of words, number of syllables, plausibility and comprehensibility. <b>Similes</b> contrasted with control sentences resulted in enhanced BOLD responses in the left inferior (IFG) and adjacent middle frontal gyrus. Concrete control sentences as compared to <b>similes</b> activated the bilateral middle temporal gyri as well as the right precuneus and the left middle frontal gyrus. Activation of the left IFG for <b>similes</b> in a short story is consistent with results on single sentence metaphor processing. The findings strengthen the importance of the left inferior frontal region in the processing of abstract figurative speech during continuous, ecologically-valid speech comprehension; the processing of concrete semantic contents goes along with a down-regulation of bilateral temporal regions...|$|R
