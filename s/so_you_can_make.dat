2500|$|In {{the fifth}} ODI game, England batsman Jos Buttler was {{controversially}} run out backing-up at the non-striker's end by Sri Lankan bowler Sachithra Senanayake, a dismissal called Mankading. Senanayake had warned Buttler twice {{before in the}} same game about moving out of his crease, before he removed his bails and appealed to umpire Michael Gough. Speaking after the game, Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews defended the decision by saying [...] "what we did was completely within the rules." [...] England coach Peter Moores said he was [...] "disappointed" [...] in Mathew's decision. Former England captain Michael Vaughan said it was [...] "no way to play the game", but another former captain, Michael Atherton, defended the decision saying [...] "You {{see a lot of}} batsmen wandering aimlessly out of their ground. It's a good lesson for him - don't be dozy and keep your bat in your crease". [...] Australian captain Michael Clarke said that [...] "I think as long as the player's warned, it's in the rules <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> whatever decision you want". Buttler's dismissal by Senanayake was the first instance of Mankading in international cricket since Peter Kirsten's innings was ended by Kapil Dev during an ODI between South Africa and India in 1992.|$|E

It would result in a thinner device because you don’t have the pieces of glass. It could conform around the sides, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> show information on the sides.
