5000|$|Android 7.1 adds native API {{support for}} {{implementing}} image keyboards; multi-endpoint telephony; <b>shortcut</b> <b>menus</b> and rounded icon assets for apps on launchers; {{and support for}} the Google Daydream virtual reality platform. The Google Daydream feature is a specific [...] "VR mode", with advanced technology for reduced graphics latency, a [...] "sustained performance mode" [...] to assist developers in optimizing apps to a device's thermal profile, a new head tracking algorithm which combines the input from various device sensors, and integration of system notifications into the VR user interface.|$|R
5000|$|Optionally {{specify the}} text {{displayed}} in the <b>shortcut</b> <b>menu</b> for the verb above. Use an ampersand (&) to select a hotkey for the menu. See below for an example.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] and letter {{method used}} for acutes and cedillas {{does not work}} for {{applications}} which assign <b>shortcut</b> <b>menu</b> functions to these key combinations. For acute accents the [...] and apostrophe method should be used.|$|E
50|$|To simplify {{and speed}} up communication, the IraqComm {{interface}} provides a <b>shortcut</b> <b>menu</b> of frequently used phrases. The user {{can change the}} phrase to be translated by editing it with thekeyboard or by selecting a similar-sounding phrase with a single press of a button.|$|E
5000|$|Workspaces: {{groups of}} web browser windows and tabs in them. A user can have {{multiple}} workspaces for different web research topics and quickly switch between {{them with a}} key <b>shortcut</b> or <b>menu</b> choice.|$|R

Touching the background or the <b>Shortcut</b> <b>Menu</b> {{on the right side}} of the phone brings up a customizable menu with 11 icons. A shortcut can be set to a program (including downloaded ones), a menu, a library, and other features on the phone.|$|E
50|$|Combo shortcuts {{are also}} {{introduced}} where players {{are able to}} assign physical/magical attacks onto the controller buttons. This reduces the time taken to create a Combo attack as one character can attack immediately after another with a simple press of the button. However, this makes the game more challenging as players have to decide quickly what kind of attack they should follow up next as the combo <b>shortcut</b> <b>menu</b> appears only for {{a short amount of}} time i.e. when the preceding character is in the midst of launching his/her attack.|$|E
50|$|In Windows programming, an {{accelerator}} table allows {{an application}} to specify {{a list of}} accelerators (keyboard <b>shortcuts)</b> for <b>menu</b> items or other commands. For example, Ctrl+S is often used as a shortcut to the File→Save menu item, Ctrl+O is a common shortcut to the File→Open menu item, etc. An accelerator takes precedence over normal processing and can be a convenient way to program some event handling.|$|R
5000|$|There is no {{automated}} installer. To install and run Memoranda, {{a user should}} manually unpack {{the distribution}} and run the startup script (.bat or [...]sh depending on the platform). Creating the desktop and <b>menu</b> <b>shortcuts</b> is also a responsibility of user.|$|R
2500|$|The {{ampersand}} {{character is}} used as a special character in at least some versions of the database software originally created in Denmark under the name Navision (the software has since been acquired by Microsoft). Using this character in either [...] "Text" [...] or [...] "Code" [...] fields could create difficulties for performing certain tasks in Navision, such as filtering records (either by the user or by programming). It is also used as described below to indicate <b>shortcuts</b> in <b>menu</b> items and labels.|$|R

50|$|Third party chat servers {{were used}} {{primarily}} to host chat {{rooms on the}} network. This {{is because of the}} improved administration systems in third party servers as well as the ability to host a chat room without having to use the winmx client. Some Third party chat clients also contained useful <b>shortcuts</b> or <b>menus</b> to make administrating a channel easier. For normal users, chat clients or the WinMX client itself could be used to view rooms independently of the server. Web listings of the chat room were also available.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports on}} the results of an {{experiment}} comparing two graphical adaptive menus for smartphones in order to improve their hierarchical navigation: " <b>Shortcut</b> <b>Menu</b> " and " Step-by-Step Menu " keep constant the actual presentation of initial menus and overlay them with a prediction window displaying the most frequently used menu items, wherever they are located in the hierarchy. In order to reach predicted items, the " Step-by-Step Menu " maintains the consistency with the initial menu through a level-by-level navigation while the " <b>Shortcut</b> <b>Menu</b> " directly moves the end user towards the predicted menu item, thus shortcutting the hierarchical navigation. Thirteen subjects performed fifty tests each on smartphones and data were collected about their item selection time and error rate. The " Step-by-Step Menu " has a positive impact on both variables, whether frequently used menu items are accurately predicted or not. The " Step-by-Step Menu " is fast, but could induce some problems when prediction is wrong...|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{by using}} an input device (keyboard, mouse) {{information}} may be transferred into the computer and drawings created in the Auto CAD can be edited using natural language. A system has been developed to generate mechanical objects, from basic primary drawings such as circle, arc, and line. Drawing commands are given in linguistic form and edit tool commands are given by using function keys from the keyboard or from the <b>shortcut</b> <b>menu.</b> The edit tools are fillet, chamfer, and trim. This project {{has the ability to}} magnify the image for better viewing. In this project a new technique has been introduced to select an object. Each object has been given a unique numerical name, thus allowing the object to be selected as many times as the name is chosen. The main goal of this project is to create a simple and easier way to draw objects without using a mouse. This will allow a physically disabled person or a person who is unable to use a mouse to draw a basic drawing by using a keyboard. This process is much more interactive and user friendly. The developed software can calculate intersection points and can write and read DXF files, which can be read by AutoCAD. After reading the DXF file it can redraw it on an AutoCAD interface. This software has been developed using Visual Basic 6, as part of the proposed system. It also provides a good foundation for a software operated by natural language communication...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper investigates using stroke {{gestures}} as <b>shortcuts</b> to <b>menu</b> selection. We first experimentally {{measured the}} performance and ease of learning of stroke shortcuts in comparison to keyboard shortcuts {{when there is no}} mnemonic link between the shortcut and the command. While both types of shortcuts had the same level of performance with enough practice, stroke shortcuts had substantial cognitive advantages in learning and recall. With the same amount of practice, users could successfully recall more shortcuts and make fewer errors with stroke shortcuts than with keyboard shortcuts. The second half of the paper focuses on UI development support and articulates guidelines for toolkits to implement stroke shortcuts {{in a wide range of}} software applications. We illustrate how to apply these guidelines by introducing the Stroke Shortcuts Toolkit (SST) which is a library for adding stroke shortcuts to Java Swing applications with just a few lines of code...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} Leaf menu, a {{new type}} of contextual linear menu that supports curved gesture shortcuts. By providing an alternative to keyboard <b>shortcuts,</b> the Leaf <b>menus</b> can be used for the selection of commands on tabletops, but its key benefit is its adequacy to small handheld touchscreen devices (PDA, Smartphone). Indeed Leaf menus define a compact and known layout inherited from linear menus, they support precise finger interaction, they manage occlusion and they can be used in close proximity to the screen borders. Moreover, by providing stroke shortcuts, they favour the selection of frequent commands in expert mode and make eye-free selection possible...|$|R
25|$|Windows Installer can {{advertise}} {{a product}} rather than actually install it. The product will appear installed to the user, {{but it will}} not actually be installed until it is run for the first time by triggering an entry point (by means of a Start <b>menu</b> <b>shortcut,</b> by opening a document that the product is configured to handle, or by invoking an advertised COM class). A package can be advertised by an administrator using Group Policy or other deployment mechanism, or by running the msiexec executable with the /jm (for per-machine advertisement) or /ju (for per-user advertisement) switch. Some MSI packages authored in InstallShield may prevent the use of these and other native MSI features.|$|R
50|$|Modules {{are what}} make LiteStep look and behave {{the way you}} want it to. There are {{graphical}} modules that are used to build GUI elements and non-graphical modules used to create hotkeys, watch window classes for scripted events, and create LiteStep-specific commands called !bang commands. !bang commands are a way to execute event-driven functions within a given theme. These commands can reference files, folders, namespaces, executables, or elements of the theme itself. Many !bang commands are hardcoded into the LiteStep core, and others may be provided through user scripts or through the currently loaded modules. Bangs are the primary way you control the modules. !bangs can be triggered through a hotkey, popup <b>menu,</b> <b>shortcut,</b> or through module-specific events.|$|R

40|$|The {{datasets}} {{being produced}} by high-throughput biological experiments, such as microarrays, have forced biologists {{to turn to}} sophisticated statistical analysis and visualization tools {{in order to understand}} their data. We address the particular need for an open-source exploratory data analysis tool that applies numerical methods in coordination with interactive graphics to the analysis of experimental data. The software package, known as explorase, provides a graphical user interface (GUI) on top of the R platform for statistical computing and the GGobi software for multivariate interactive graphics. The GUI is designed for use by biologists, many of whom are unfamiliar with the R language. It displays metadata about experimental design and biological entities in tables that are sortable and filterable. There are <b>menu</b> <b>shortcuts</b> to the analysis methods implemented in R, including graphical interfaces to linear modeling tools. The GUI is linked to data plots in GGobi through a brush tool that simultaneously colors rows in the entity information table and points in the GGobi plots. ...|$|R
5000|$|Another early {{example of}} the boss key is in the IBM PC version of Asylum, which clears the screen when F9 is pressed. Certain games have taken {{the idea of the}} boss key and used it to comic effect. Infocom's adult-themed Leather Goddesses of Phobos (only the IBM PC version) had a boss key which would hide the game and show a screen {{designed}} to look like a Cornerstone database view. Upon closer inspection, however, the screen was not exactly boss safe, being populated with order info on rather ridiculous adult items, including an [...] "inflatable milkman". Sierra On-Line's comedy/sci-fi adventure game Space Quest III had a so-called boss key available from the game's pulldown menu. However, when the user selected it, the screen would cut to black and inform the user that his or her boss wouldn't be happy if he or she knew how long the user had been playing the game. It then displayed the total elapsed game time. The first few games in Sierra's Leisure Suit Larry series included a boss key in the pulldown <b>menus</b> (<b>shortcut</b> usually Ctrl+B). However, when this is used, it results in an instantaneous game over with the first game saying [...] "Sorry, but you'll have to restore your game; when you panic, I forget everything!" [...] The computer submarine game, GATO, when ESC was clicked, brought up a Lotus 1-2-3 type spreadsheet screen.|$|R
2500|$|Windows Vista and its successors added {{minor changes}} to the menu. Prior to Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the Start menu {{consisted}} of a group of menus and sub-menus that cascaded and expanded, obscuring the initially visible portions of the screen beneath them. In Windows Vista, however, cascading menus were replaced by a sliding window in the left pane of the Start menu. Whenever All Programs item is clicked, the contents of the left pane slide off the left edge of the Start menu and the All Programs menu slides in from the right edge of the left column. This menu presents a tree view of it hierarchy that expands towards the bottom, with a vertical scrollbar whenever needed. Also added in Windows Vista is a Search box that allows users to search for the Start <b>menu</b> <b>shortcuts</b> or other files and folders. The search box features incremental search: If indexing is not turned off, the search box returns results on-the-fly as users type into it. Since the found items can be immediately opened, the Start menu search box replaces the function of Run command from previous versions of Windows. The Run command can also be added separately to the right column in the Start menu. In Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the search results pane covers both columns of the Start menu. The search box is extended to support searching Control Panel items. The right column in Windows 7 links to Libraries instead of ordinary folders. Most importantly, however, items on the Start menu support Jump lists through cascade buttons on their right. Unlike prior versions, the ability to revert to the [...] "Classic" [...] Start menu design is no longer available.|$|R
