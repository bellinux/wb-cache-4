The experiments were conducted on winter cereal seeding in a Po valley farm in October 2011. The tests were carried out as follows: wheat variety seeding, over corn and alfalfa crops, in large plots with three repetitions for each thesis. They included: <b>sod</b> <b>seeding</b> anticipated by round up weeding {{in the case of}} the plots over alfalfa; traditional plowing at 35 cm followed by rotary tillage and combined seeding (seeder plus rotary tiller); minimum tillage based on ripping at the same depth (35 cm) and combined seeder (seeder plus rotary tiller). The following farm operations - fertilizer, and other agrochemical distributionshave been the same in all the considered theses. The results, statistically significant (P< 0. 001) in terms of yields, highlighted slight differences: the best data {{in the case of the}} traditional plowing both in the case of wheat crop over corn and alfalfa (84. 43 and 6. 75 t/ha); slightly lower yields for the <b>sod</b> <b>seeding</b> (6. 23 and 79. 9 t/ha for corn and alfalfa respectively); lower in the case of minimum tillage (5. 87; 79. 77 t/ha in the two situations).

Three sowing techniques, broadcasting, <b>sod</b> <b>seeding</b> and strip seeding, each with two rates of fertiliser, 150 or 300 kg/ha molybdic sulphur superphosphate (8 % P, 20 % S), were used. By mid December, 48 % and 38 % establishment had occurred in the strip and <b>sod</b> <b>seeding</b> treatments respectively, but only 10 % in the broadcast. Strip seeding resulted in the earliest taproot and rhizome development of Caucasian clover and the greatest lateral spread of rhizomes. However, all plants strip and <b>sod</b> <b>seeding</b> developed rhizomes after nine months. Plants established by broadcasting were small with few rhizomes in the first season. The higher fertiliser rate improved establishment and growth, particularly in the strip seeding treatment. Strip seeded Caucasian clover established as rapidly as white clover and plants were similar in size after five months. However, Caucasian clover had a larger underground mass {{which could lead to}} greater persistence. A grazing trial was established to observe how two cultivars of Caucasian clover and two seed lines of zig zag clover responded to four diverse grazing treatments. The experiment was located at Lincoln University, latitude 43 º 39 S and longitude 172 º 28 E on a medium to free-draining soil of medium fertility with an annual rainfall of 651 mm. In March 1989 a seed production experiment was established and consisted of Caucasian clover cultivars Alpine and Monaro and zig zag clover seed lines Porters Pass and Kentucky. In spring of 1992 high endophyte ryegrass was direct drilled into this experiment. The first grazing to establish main plot treatments occurred in early October 1993. The experiment design was a randomised block design with two replicates of four treatments. The treatments included two grazing frequencies; rotational grazing and set stocking; and two grazing intensities; hard and lax. Point analysis was used {{to measure the}} botanical composition of the pastures. Only the hexaploid Monaro Caucasian clover was agronomically suitable as a companion for high endophyte ryegrass and white clover under the range of grazing managements. The zig zag clovers showed a classic hay type species inability to persist and contribute to dry matter production under grazing. The diploid Alpine Caucasian clover persisted undergrazing but had a low cover percentage. Monaro Caucasian clover had a mean seasonal cover of between 14 % and 21 % in the grazing treatments, contributing more to pasture cover in the rotationally grazed treatments.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the best method to establish subterranean clover on medusahead infested ranges in Western Oregon. Secondary objectives of this study were to determind the effects of management treatments on (a) subterranean clover density, (b) density of medusahead and other vegetation, and (c) yield of subterranean clover. Four treatments for establishing subterranean clover were compared including two seeding methods superimposed over six old treatments for controlling medusahead. The results of this experiment are as follows: Subterranean clover density was found to be significantly higher early in the season in the <b>sod</b> plus broadcast <b>seeded</b> area, in all but the chemically treated areas, when compared with the <b>sod</b> <b>seeded</b> area. The number of subterranean clover plants per square foot in May was significantly higher in the <b>sod</b> plus broadcast <b>seeded</b> areas in all but the chemical treatment. There was a great loss of subterranean clover plants in both methods of seeding from March through April; this was due to poor nodulation. Vegetation density was significantly lower in the chemical-mowed and sheep-grazed treatments in May. Medusahead density was lower in only the chemical-mowed treatment. It appears that removing the old vegetation before applying paraquat makes the chemical more effective in controlling medusahead and other vegetation. The yield of vegetation other than subterranean clover ranged from 1, 871 to 2, 437 pounds per acre. The yield of vegetation in the chemical-mowed and sheep-grazed treatment was significantly lower than in the mechanical and control treatment. Subterranean clover yields, which were highest in the <b>sod</b> plus broadcast <b>seeded</b> areas, ranged from 22 to 397 pounds per acre. The chemical-unmowed treatment along with a previous control treatment had the highest yield: the lowest yield was obtained in the mechanical treatment combined with a late grazed treatment. Low yields of subterranean clover were attributed to lack of nodulation which probably was caused by dessication of rhizobja prior to sowing (a 24 hour delay in broadcast inoculated seed), drying after seeding because of poor coverage in drill rows and lack of available phosphorus. In establishing subterranean clover on similar sites, reduction of vegetation would be of prime importance. Prior grazing would be beneficial as shown, but because of the unpalatable and low nutritional value of annual grasses in summer and autumn, vegetation removal might depend on use of fire or mechanical means, with or without herbicides. For stand establishment sod- seeding was more effective than broadcasting the seed. A higher rate of seeding is suggested when surface broadcasting seed onto undisturbed soil. Continued work on establishing of subterranean clover on medusahead infested sites should include the variables mentioned above...|$|R

40|$|The {{invasion}} and persistence of smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.) {{is a serious}} problem facing managers of prairie remnants on the northern Great Plains. This study, conducted from 1988 - 91 at Mead, Nebraska, and from 1989 - 91 at Pipestone National Monument, Minnesota, consisted of 3 components. The first component measured changes in smooth brome tiller density and biomass and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) flower culm density in mixed stands following spring burns. Burning was timed to coincide with four smooth brome growth stages and included repeated burns in consecutive years. Burning during smooth brome tiller elongation, heading, and flowering significantly reduced tiller density and biomass. Burning early, at tiller emergence, had no effect on smooth brome in years when precipitation was normal or below normal. However, with above normal precipitation, biomass more than doubled after an early burn. Repeated burns, at the time of tiller elongation and later stages, maintained low tiller density and biomass. A single burn, however, allowed full to partial recovery. The greatest increase in big bluestem flower culm density was coincident with the greatest decrease in smooth brome tiller density. ^ A second component of the study compared differences in the microenvironment between sites dominated by smooth brome and those dominated by big bluestem following early spring burning. Burning smooth brome dominated sites during a dry period resulted in lower soil moisture and lower soil temperatures when compared to burned sites dominated by big bluestem. ^ The third component of this study compared the effectiveness of burning a pure stand of smooth brome at tiller elongation to other methods of smooth brome suppression before <b>sod</b> <b>seeding</b> big bluestem. Atrazine was the only treatment effective in reducing smooth brome tiller density.

A recent report from the Stoneville unit shows that “a combination of late summer mowing, fall herbicide application, and normal winter conditions can prevent TSA survival. ” Although the plant is known to overwinter as far north as 35 degrees latitude, Bryson says early detection and other control methods by persistent cattle ranchers in several states have prevented cattle from spreading the weed northward. He says Florida cattle ranchers were aided by recent severe winters and drought. The Cattle Connection Cattle cannot resist the sweet smell of TSA’s golf-ball-sized, yellow fruit, Bryson says. “Cows will reach into the prickly plant with their long tongue and snatch the mature fruit off without getting injured,” he says. When cattle are moved to neighboring states for winter feeding, they transport ingested seeds with them. The seeds are also spread by way of composted manure, grass <b>seed,</b> <b>sod,</b> or hay, as well as by deer and other wildlife. TSA infests pastureland by outcompeting forage grasses, and the prickly foliage drives cows from shaded areas, leading to heat stress. Losses to Florida cattle ranchers are estimated to be about $ 11 million annually...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} {{the question of}} {{the presence or absence of}} legumin in the seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris L. it was decided to investigate the globulin fraction of seed proteins from mature seeds of French bean. A legumin protein was partially purified and the N- terminal sequences of both subunit polypeptides of a 75 kDa legumin subunits determined, which proved unequivocally that these polypeptides are subunits of a P. vulgaris legumin. The N-terminal amino acid determination of further five disulphide-linked polypeptides of lower Mr revealed that all these polypeptides may well derive from the 75 kDa P. vulgaris legumin as the N-terminal amino acids showed complete sequence homology. The size differences of these legumin subunits might be due to peptide cleavage at the C-terminal end of the legumin a-chains. Potential mechanisms for this catalytic event are discussed. In addition, a second protein. Glycoprotein I, an albumin type seed protein, was isolated from the albumin fraction of the seed proteins of P. vulgaris and the N-terminal amino acids of its subunits were determined. The obtained sequence data of the three different subunits revealed high similarity to the hyper-variable region of legumin J and K from pea. Whilst it is not inconceivable that both polypeptides represent independent protein subunits reflecting the same evolutionary mechanisms to increase the nitrogen content of storage proteins, based on the sizes of the Glycoprotein I subunits and the sequence similarity to the hyper-variable region of a-chains of legumins the hypotheses is discussed that Glycoprotein I may derive from a P. vulgaris legumin by cleavage of peptides from the C-terminal end of the a-chain and formation of a new polypeptide, Glycoprotein I, with new solubility characteristics (water-soluble like albumins). Furthermore, Glycoprotein I was investigated during seed germination by immunodetection with antibodies raised against the purified protein. The results showed that Glycoprotein I serves as a reserve protein in an early stage of seed germination. In order to obtain extensive sequence information on legumins from P. vulgaris it was decided to attempt to amplify a legumin gene fragment from genomic DNA of P. vulgaris using the polymerase chain reaction technique. Southern analysis of PGR products using a pea-legumin as a probe gave strong evidence for the successful amplification of legumin encoding genes from genomic P. vulgaris DNA. However, neither the cloning of these PGR products nor the repeats of this PGR experiment were successful. A new PGR approach to amplify legumin gene fragments from genomic DNA of P. vulgaris using an oligonucleotide sequence for the reverse primer designed on the basis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the β-chain is discussed. The nucleotide sequence of a PGR artefact of one of the unsuccessful repeats of the PGR experiment showed sequence similarity to Arcelin 2, a gene found in wild types of P. vulgaris. Arcelin proteins provide the plant with resistance against an important pest weevil, but have never been observed in cultivars of P. vulgaris. Arcelin genes are thought to have been either totally lost or inactivated during domestication of the French bean. Further isolated and identified proteins from the albumin fraction of seed proteins from P. vulgaris include a superoxide dismutase (SOD). The determination of the N-terminal amino acids of the subunit poypeptide provides the first reported sequence information of a <b>SOD</b> in mature <b>seeds</b> of higher plants. The potential localisation within the seed tissue and the putative role of the presence of a <b>SOD</b> in mature <b>seeds</b> during dormancy is discussed. Two more polypeptides were isolated from the albumin fraction and identified by N- terminal sequencing as chitinases. Whereas pvchi 25 showed high sequence similarity to class n chitinases, pvchi 32 was shown to be a class III chitinase. Pvchi 32 provides the first reported class HI chitinase in mature seeds of higher plants and the second so far described glycosylated chitinase. The potential use of these seed chitinases in crop protection is discussed. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of both enzymes was tested as well as cross-reactivity to antibodies raised against ethylene-induced bean leaf chitinases. Pvchi 25 was observed during seed germination by immunodetection confirming its role in the protection of the seed during dormancy and early germination...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 The {{effect of}} {{increased}} manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (cAPX) on various abiotic stresses was studied using transgenic tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) plants. Transformants were selected in vitro based on kanamycin resistance, confirmed by PCR and northern blot analyses. Northern blots showed an enhanced gene expression of Mn-SOD and cAPX in transgenic Mn-SOD and cAPX plants, respectively. APX native gel assay showed APX activity in transgenic cAPX plants several fold {{greater than in}} wild-type (WT) plants {{in the absence of}} stress. An additional Mn-SOD enzyme activity band was detected by native PAGE in transformed Mn-SOD plants. Germination of cAPX tomato plant seeds at low temperature (9 °C) was greater than of WT seeds. Leaf tissues of the transgenic cAPX plants had lower electrolyte leakage in response to cold temperatures (4 °C) than leaf tissues of WT plants. Transgenic Mn-SOD plants also showed resistance to the superoxide- generating herbicide methyl viologen (MV, 10 ⁻⁴ M). The total SOD activity was 1. 5 - to 2 -fold higher and APX activity was 6 - to 7 -fold higher in transgenic Mn- SOD plants than in WT plants under MV stress, respectively. Germination of Mn- <b>SOD</b> tomato plant <b>seeds</b> in the presence of 150 mM NaCl was greater than in seeds from WT plants. Transgenic Mn-SOD shoots developed more roots under salt stress (200 mM and 250 mM NaCl, respectively). Both transgenic Mn-SOD and cAPX plant seedlings had enhanced ability to tolerate NaCl stress (200 mM and 250 mM). Total APX activity of transgenic plants was several fold higher than that of WT under salt stress (200 mM NaCl). Leaves and fruits from Mn-SOD or cAPX transgenic tomato plants were more resistant to heat (40 °C) and UV-B (2. 5 mW/cm² for 5 days) stresses compared to WT plants, respectively. Detached fruits from transgenic plants showed more resistance to sunscald in a field test. APX activity in leaves of the transgenic cAPX plants was several fold higher than that of WT plant leaves when exposed to the heat, drought, and UV-B stresses...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} general remarks on the {{establishment}} of the direct seed-drilling which may recover wasted pastures in the highland area of Kyushu. The pasture management from the viewpoint of its maintenance and utilization is indispensable to the sustainable production of livestock from pastures. In pastures in the highland area of Kyushu which belongs to the Asian monsoon zone, the persistence of temperate pastures is limited to short years on account of unfavorable conditions such as high temperature and large rainfall in summer and the difficulty in pasture management. The author investigated the vegetation changes {{that took place in the}} pasture management related to weather, grazing and fertilization factors. This resulted, however, in wasted pastures owing to overgrazing and fertilizing in summer, where bare grounds appeared and were occupied by various weeds and there was a reduction of main valuable grass species. Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) is considered a main grass in the highland area of Kyushu. Then, to recover vegetation simply in wasted pastures, I made attempts at overseeding and weed control which were considered of importance to the pasture management. Moreover, as the overseeding was not easy, some basic experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of various factors on the establishment of seed drilled into pasture sods. First, to promote the germination rate of seeds, the following two experiments were conducted. (1) Effects of soaking or air-drying pretreatment and sprinkling the seed bed on the early germination of orchardgrass. It was suggested that seed soaking or air-drying pretreatment promoted the early germination rate of the seed in case of low-moisture soil. (2) Effects of three water holding materials (vermiculite, Sphagnum, synthetic resim) added to the surface of low-moisture volcanic ash soil on the soil water cpntent and early germination of orchardgrass. It was suggested that adding water holding materials to the surface of low-moisture volcanic ash soil promoted the germination rate of the seed directly drilled into deteriorated pasture sods by improving soil water condition. Second, to promote {{the establishment of the}} seedlings of orchardgrass oversown into the bare ground, orchardgrass sod or Kentucky bluegrass <b>sod,</b> effects of <b>seeding</b> time (Aug. 1, Sep. 1, Oct. 1), nitrogenous fertilization (5 kgN/ 10 a of fast-release fertilizer, 5 kgN/ 10 a or 10 kgN/ 10 a of slow-release fertilizer) and post-sowing trimming frequency (none, once, twice) were conducted. It was suggested that (1) seeding time should be chosen according to the vegetation condition of pastures, (2) the form and amount of fertilizer applied were dependent on the seeding time, and (3) trimming the existent sward around orchardgrass seedlings should be done to give favorable light condition. Third, effects of time and frequency of cutting on stem density and plant length of orchardgrass which had been drilled in the previous year into the bare ground, orchardgrass sod and Kentucky bluegrass sod. It was suggested that cutting at the early heading stage in the next spring was important to increase stem density and plant length. Results of the present study suggested that overseeding in October with the application of slow-release fertilizer at 5 kgN/ 10 a level followed by twice post-sowing trimming and cutting the grass at early heading stage in the next spring were most effective for the establishment of orchardgrass drilled into tussock-formed orchardgrass sward...|$|R
