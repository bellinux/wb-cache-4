Designed by the engineer Emilio Mitre (son of the Argentine president Bartolomé Mitre), the hotel had 3 floors, a lift and 50 rooms with a ground floor dining room seating 200 people. There were salons for smoking, billiards, and for ladies. The hotel had a confiteria, tennis courts, a cricket pitch, an area for roller skating, and there was a garage for cars. An Andalusian patio and a winter garden were constructed and in 1895 the hotel was authorised to open a casino.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{shifts the}} debate on {{sustainable}} tourism destinations from an emphasis on ecotourism and eco-resorts towards sustainable urban tourism destinations. A quantitative online survey of visitors to Melbourne, Australia, examined tourists' pro-environmental behaviours in four major categories: recycling; green transport use; sustainable energy/material use (lighting/water usage), and green food consumption. It explores five major antecedents to those categories: habitual behaviour, environmental attitudes, facilities available, a {{need to take a}} break from environmental duties, and sense of <b>tourist</b> <b>social</b> responsibility. The paper also examines the poorly understood belief that pro-environmental behaviour weakens when residents become tourists. Existing habits were found to strongly influence all four urban pro-environmental behaviours. Available facilities are the second most important antecedent. Overall, urban tourist pro-environment behaviour drivers differ markedly from those of residents or ecotourists. A range of tourism industry and public sector agency policy recommendations are made, in terms of developing specific, well sited and easy to find/use environmental infrastructure assets such as recycling facilities and public transport, reducing implementation barriers and in formulating an overall pro-environmental image for the destination. The study envisages a new concept, <b>tourist</b> <b>social</b> responsibility, with high relevance to furthering tourism's sustainability.

40|$|Social {{interaction}} and meeting other travellers {{is an integral}} part of the backpacking experience. Backpackers' preference for budget accommodation means that they often stay in communal hostel rooms, facilitating this social interaction. The exchange of information about travel experiences as a product of the social interaction between backpackers throughout their travels has important implications for where they stay, what they see and the meanings they derive from their journeys. While word-of-mouth promotion is consistently identified as a key characteristic of backpacking tourism and an important source of information used in travel decision-making, there has been little research done in an effort to investigate this phenomenon. While social situation analysis has been employed to examine tourist-guide interaction, as well as interactions between hosts and guests, it has not been used to examine interactions between travellers.

40|$|In recent decades, tourism {{has become}} an {{important}} industry; it is an economic activity that is in continuous evolution.

Creating value for an Alpine destination means to create tourism products targeted to specific market segments and providing services for these segments. If environmental, cultural, and economic impacts of tourism in mountain destinations are managed with the right balance, many benefits can be realized both for mountain communities and those who choose to experience these destinations. Mountain tourism, which accounts for 18 - 20 per cent of the global tourism, is a heterogeneous scenario within this industry in terms of characteristics, <b>social</b> aspects, <b>tourist</b> offers and management approaches.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} uncover the factors, regularities, and tendencies which govern and {{describe}} activity space pattern, structure, and formation in small tourism-dependent {{areas of the world}} economic periphery (hinterland resorts). Tourist/resident socio-spatial relations are viewed in the context of activity participation, the patronage of attractions, and the <b>social</b> profiles of <b>tourists</b> and residents. It is considered important that the nature of international tourism presents a special problem in the investigation of activity space; the massive influx of metropolitan visitors to hinterland resorts dramatises and localises the First World-Third World relationship. The activity spaces of tourists and residents, based on various measures of visitation at attractions, are mapped. These perspectives are then synthesized into a single picture of tourist and resident activity space, via the notion of person-time. The structure of the activity spaces is then investigated in terms of the factors which describe participation and visitation, and the factors which discriminate between tourist space and resident space. The judgements of tourists and residents, concerning the perception of each group by the other along bi-polar constructs, are used to evaluate the objective prior distinction (activity spaces) and to pinpoint the constructs that tourists associate with residents and resident places and residents with tourists and tourist places. It is shown that even though tourists and residents do not use the constructs identically, the dimensionality implied in tourist space and resident space remains intact. Finally, the <b>social</b> affiliations of <b>tourists</b> and residents are used to demonstrate how tourist space and resident space manifest themselves socially, and to show the social nature of activity space formation...|$|R
