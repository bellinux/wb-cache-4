50|$|The PDZ {{domain of}} <b>SCRIB</b> binds {{directly}} to the human papillomavirus E6 protein. <b>SCRIB</b> is targeted for ubiquitination by a complex of E6 and UBE3A and E6 induces degradation of <b>SCRIB.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, <b>SCRIB</b> {{has been}} identified as a tumor suppressor along with DLGAP5 (Discs large) and LLGL1 (Lethal giant larvae). Specifically, <b>SCRIB</b> deficient mutants have been shown to promote the activity of numerous oncogenes. For example, <b>SCRIB</b> is known to inhibit breast cancer formation and the depletion of <b>SCRIB</b> promotes neoplastic growth by disrupting morphogenesis and inhibiting cell death through an association with Myc. In human cells expressing oncogenic Ras or Raf, it was found the loss of <b>SCRIB</b> resulted in the invasion of the extracellular matrix by various cell types. This is believed to be a direct result of regulation of the MAP Kinase pathway by <b>SCRIB.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>SCRIB,</b> {{also known}} as Scribble, SCRIBL, or Scribbled homolog (Drosophila), is a {{scaffold}} protein which in humans is encoded by the <b>SCRIB</b> gene. It was originally isolated in Drosophila melanogaster in a pathway ({{also known as}} the Scribble complex) with DLGAP5 (Discs large) and LLGL1 (Lethal giant larvae) as a tumor suppressor. In humans, <b>SCRIB</b> is found as a membrane protein and is involved in cell migration, cell polarity, and cell proliferation in epithelial cells. There is also strong evidence that <b>SCRIB</b> {{may play a role}} in cancer progression because of its strong homology to the Drosophila protein.|$|E

In June 2009, <b>Scribd</b> launched <b>Scribd</b> Store, and shortly thereafter closed a deal with Simon & Schuster to sell ebooks on <b>Scribd.</b> In 2012, the company became profitable.|$|R
50|$|Adler {{received}} {{inspiration for}} <b>Scribd</b> from {{a conversation with}} his father, who had difficulty publishing an academic paper in a medical journal.

50|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, <b>SCRIB</b> is {{involved}} in synaptic function, neuroblast differentiation, and epithelial polarization. Mechanistically, the human homolog is a scaffold protein linked to cellular differentiation centered on the regulation of epithelial as well as neuronal morphogenesis. Deficiency in <b>SCRIB</b> impairs many aspects of cell polarity and cell movement. <b>SCRIB</b> is also likely involved in establishing apical-basal polarity as well as progression from the G1 phase to S phase in the cell cycle {{as a result of}} its relationship with cell proliferation and exocytosis.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{its role}} in cell {{polarity}} and cell motility, <b>SCRIB</b> has also been implicated in epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is linked to tumor metastasis and proliferation in many cancers. EMT is implicated in cancer progression by allowing static epithelial cells to become migratory and allowing these cells to adapt to as well as colonize new environments. In cancerous epithelial tissues, <b>SCRIB</b> is found primarily in the cytosol as opposed to its usual location in the membrane, thus further implicating a role in tumor progression and EMT for <b>SCRIB.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>SCRIB</b> {{is found}} in the cell {{membrane}} most often as a peripheral membrane protein. The Scribble complex is localized at the basolateral membrane. <b>SCRIB</b> is also found in cellular junctions such as adherens junctions and tight junctions. Specifically, it is located in the kidney, skeletal muscles, liver, lung, breast, intestine, placenta and epithelial cells.|$|E
50|$|In June 2009, <b>Scribd</b> {{launched}} the <b>Scribd</b> Store, enabling writers to easily upload and sell digital copies {{of their work}} online. That same month, the site partnered with Simon & Schuster to sell e-books on <b>Scribd.</b> The deal made digital editions of 5,000 titles available for purchase on <b>Scribd,</b> including books from bestselling authors like Stephen King, Dan Brown, and Mary Higgins Clark.|$|R
50|$|In October 2013, <b>Scribd</b> {{launched}} a subscription ebook service, {{and signed a}} deal with HarperCollins to make their backlist books available on <b>Scribd.</b> <b>Scribd</b> currently has more than 300,000 titles from 1,000 publishers in its book subscription service.|$|R
