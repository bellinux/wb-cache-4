50|$|A <b>slip</b> <b>lane</b> is a {{road traffic}} lane {{provided}} at an intersection to allow vehicles to {{turn at the}} intersection without actually entering it and interfering with through traffic. It therefore is not controlled by any traffic signals at that intersection. There {{are two types of}} <b>slip</b> <b>lane</b> - those where the lane continues into its own lane in the road which it turns into and those where the lane terminates at the point where it enters the road turned into.|$|E

50|$|According to Alberta Transportation, “truck aprons are {{designed}} to support the weight of large trucks and help long vehicles turn safely through roundabouts. Truck aprons are between the road portion of the roundabout and the inner circle of the roundabout. On <b>slip</b> <b>lanes,</b> the truck apron is located between the road surface (bitumen) and the sidewalk.Both in roundabouts and <b>slip</b> <b>lanes</b> the truck apron is raised slightly, {{in an attempt to}} keep light vehicles on the main road surface. The truck apron is constructed of reinforced concrete.In many parts of North America planners, designers, and builders attempted to make truck aprons and roundabouts more attractive by stamping and colouring the concrete. From a distance the concrete looks like red paving stones.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are some}} {{priority}} [...] "head start" [...] lanes at various intersections that allow buses bypass traffic queues and then enter the intersection before other traffic. Major roundabouts have special <b>slip</b> <b>lanes</b> that allow buses to skip queues {{and having to}} give way to the right.|$|R

30|$|The expressways {{are mostly}} 3 -lane dual carriageways, except at certain {{locations}} {{where they are}} upgraded to 4 -lane dual carriageways. The expressways have on-ramps and <b>slip</b> <b>lanes</b> that allow the vehicles to enter or exit, respectively. All the arterial roads are 2 -lane dual carriageways. The lane widths are 3.7  m for expressways and 3.4  m for other roads. The speed limits vary from 80 to 90  km/h for expressways and 60 to 70  km/h for arterials roads.|$|R
5000|$|At Weelsby Road, {{there existed}} previously, a subway beneath the Grimsby to Louth Railway {{and to provide}} access to the new road, the subway was filled in and a new traffic signal {{junction}} created. [...] Some residential property was purchased by agreement and this allowed the construction of <b>slip</b> <b>lanes</b> from Weelsby Road to the new Peaks Parkway and Peaks Parkway itself to be widened to allow 2 lanes in each direction immediately at the junction.|$|R
50|$|Truck aprons {{are used}} on roundabouts and <b>slip</b> <b>lanes</b> to {{compensate}} for the off-tracking of larger vehicles.Off-tracking is the shorter path that the rear wheels follow as a vehicle moves around a corner. The longer the vehicle and the sharper the turn, the greater the deviation between the path of the front wheels and the rear wheels, or off-tracking.On some smaller roundabouts, the larger vehicle may have to proceed straight across the truck apron to safely navigate the roundabout.|$|R
5000|$|On 7 September 2012, BEST {{announced}} that it would implement a bus rapid transit system (BRTS) with dedicated lanes on the GMLR.

The project will cost [...] Existing service roads {{on each side of the}} artery will be converted into additional drive lanes, expanding the road to four lanes in each direction. The <b>slip</b> <b>lane</b> will be reserved for BEST buses.|$|E
50|$|Between Crosby and Athens, {{the route}} meandered about, {{travelling}} in a generally east-southeast direction through {{the communities of}} Forfar, Philipsville and Delta. At Delta, the highway becomes sandwiched between Upper and Lower Beverley lakes, curving northeast around the southern shores of the former. At Washburns Corners, the route turns east until reaching Athens. The final segment of Highway 42 — between Athens and Forthton — zigzagged northeast and southeast. Midway between the two communities, it passed through Glen Elbe. The route ended at a junction with Highway 29, where a <b>slip</b> <b>lane</b> connected eastbound Highway 42 with southbound Highway 29 towards Brockville.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{distinguishing}} {{differences of}} a Melway-style map from other Australian street directories {{is in the}} rendering of roads. Rather than the traditional drawing of two lines with the road name printed in-between, (known as 'double casing') Melway maps show a single line with the name above or below the road, in many colours reflecting the identity or usage of the road. This allows for much more detail {{to fit into the}} same size map, as well as showing dual carriageways, <b>slip</b> <b>lanes,</b> service roads, speed bumps, roundabouts, and other useful information.|$|R
5000|$|The {{transport}} {{engine of}} Citybound is its most developed features {{to date and}} was released in the Road and Traffic Prototype 1, the game's first public release in early 2017. In Citybound roads are defined by the sum of their composite lanes such as traffic lanes, median strips, on-street parking, or bus lanes. New lane additions snap onto {{the edge of an}} existing road and the whole constructed road can be drawn together. The distinction of lanes as independent elements drawn together allows them to separate for much more organic and realistic road junctions entailing merging <b>lanes</b> and on-ramps, <b>slip</b> <b>lanes,</b> and turning lanes.|$|R
50|$|The {{project was}} {{completed}} by Habib Construction Services and consists of four bridges, two along Ferozepur Road, an exit ramp towards Wahdat road, and a canal bridge for canal service roads. Flyover no. 1 carries Kalma Chowk Flyover-bound traffic while Ichra-bound traffic is being served through Flyover no. 2. Traffic coming from Kalma Chowk Flyover bound to Wahdat road makes use of the exit ramp. The canal bridge is for U-turns. The structures consist of massive reinforced concrete piles, piers, transoms, I&L-shape pre-stressed girders, box girders and deck slabs. Reinforced concrete retaining walls are designed to serve as ramps of flyovers. In addition to these structures, various <b>slip</b> <b>lanes</b> and service roads have been constructed at grade.|$|R
50|$|About 0.3 mi {{east of the}} Palmetto Expressway, SR 878 has {{a partial}} diamond {{interchange}} with Southwest 72nd Avenue, which only allows westbound entry to and eastbound exit from the Snapper Creek Expressway. Immediately afterwards, SR 878 turns to the southeast and prepares to meet its eastern terminus at the South Dixie Highway (US 1) at a surface intersection 0.6 mi later, passing under the Metrorail line and associated MetroPath just before doing so. Traffic heading south along US 1 from eastbound SR 878 moves into a <b>slip</b> <b>lane,</b> while that wishing to head north along US 1 enters it at an oblique angle, aided by traffic signals. The only access onto SR 878 westbound from US 1 is for southbound traffic; motorists heading north along US 1 are guided to SR 878 by signage along Southwest 67th Avenue and Southwest 80th Street.|$|E
50|$|Truck aprons {{are used}} on slip lanes to {{compensate}} for a larger vehicle’s off-tracking and reduce the points of conflict in an intersection.On smaller intersections or roundabouts, the truck apron allows for bigger right-turning vehicles to navigate the corner without {{the rear of the}} vehicle travelling over the sidewalk. By essentially widening the corner, the truck apron reduces the possibility of the rear portion of the vehicle driving over the sidewalk and striking a pedestrian or a fixed object.On larger multi-lane intersections, the truck apron reduces points of intersection between large right-turning vehicles and lanes of opposing traffic. By widening the <b>slip</b> <b>lane</b> via the truck apron, large right turning vehicles are able to turn directly into the right-hand lane of the road onto which the vehicle is turning. The trailer or rear of the vehicle will safely off-track into the truck apron.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} terminus of {{the highway}} is at the Eelup Roundabout, a large, traffic light controlled roundabout that distributes traffic to Koombana Drive, Sandridge Road, Robertson Drive and Forrest Highway. Traffic coming from Forrest Highway has a <b>slip</b> <b>lane</b> that allows free flowing of traffic onto Robertson Drive, whereas the southbound Forrest Highway traffic must proceed through 2 sets of traffic lights. After the roundabout, the road continues South as a 80km/hr zone. There is a traffic light controlled intersection with Picton Road and South Western Highway (Northern Section, which proceeds as State Route 20), from which the road becomes a 70km/hr zone. The road crosses over the Australind railway line and then descends into the Bunbury Industrial Area, with a major traffic light controlled intersection with South Western Highway (Southern Section, which proceeds as National Route 1) and Brittain Road. The road continues south, now an 80km/hr zone, followed by a sharp turn towards the west, meeting an intersection with Sommerville Drive. Following the Sommerville Intersection, there is access provided to TAFE, the ECU Campus and the Hospitals. The roads southern terminus is with Bussell Highway at a roundabout with Bussell Highway gaining the State Route 10 marker in the southerly direction.|$|E
50|$|The {{first section}} was {{completed}} in 1972 and bypassed the suburb of Green Island.This section began {{at the southern end}} of Kaikorai Valley Road at Burnside, and travelled south for 2.5 kilometres, dividing Green Island from Abbotsford. It ended {{at the southern end of}} Green Island, and connected with the main south road through Fairfield. Construction of this section of motorway is considered by some people to have been a causal factor of the Abbotsford Landslide in 1979.Around the same time, construction began on the section traversing Saddle Hill, from Mosgiel to Fairfield. Earthworks were undertaken to allow for the construction of a four-lane motorway with northbound and southbound <b>slip</b> <b>lanes</b> extending from a future interchange with SH87 at Mosgiel. At the time the road was constructed with two lanes and a northbound passing lane northward from the SH1/SH87 intersection.|$|R

As for Lane, he had {{overestimated}} his strength. A deadly numbness attacked his nerves, and he had almost lost the sense of touch. When they arrived at Mel's home the snow-storm had abated somewhat, and the lighted windows of the cottage shone brightly.|$|R
50|$|The lane-by-lane {{capacity}} and performance analysis method used by Sidra Intersection helps {{to identify any}} de facto exclusive lanes, unequal lane utilisation, modelling of short lanes (turn bays, lanes with parking upstream, and loss of a lane at the exit side) and lane blockage in shared lanes including lanes containing opposed (permitted) turns, <b>slip</b> (bypass) <b>lane</b> movements and turns on red. Intersections and networks can be modelled in detail using this method with advantages over approach-based and lane group-based methods.|$|R
40|$|Right-turn bypass lanes can be {{implemented}} in conventional and innovative roundabout intersections to increase the capacity and improve the global functional performances. The Right-turn bypass lanes (also called slip lanes) can be distinguished according to the planimetric layout and the entry control type (stop, yield slip or Free Flow acceleration lane). This paper presents a closed-form model for the estimation of capacity, delays and level of service of roundabout equipped with Right-turn bypass lanes, considering the effect of geometric <b>slip</b> <b>lane</b> schemes, control type, vehicular and pedestrian flow. In order to examine the traffic conditions which can benefit from <b>slip</b> <b>lane</b> roundabouts in terms of capacity and delays, compared to traditional schemes which have no additional lanes, {{a great number of}} analyses have been carried out by considering different O/D matrices and vehicle and pedestrian flow vectors. Such comparisons have been made by considering the control delays in function of different O/D matrices. Such O/D matrices describe the most significant situations of traffic demand which can be of interest for the road intersections under study. </p...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the success of}} the new Ghost Island diverge layout, which is an alternative design incorporating a wide 'tiger-tailed' ghost island painted area. It enables drivers to leave the motorway either at the first exit point entering <b>slip</b> <b>lane</b> 1 or at the second exit point entering <b>slip</b> <b>lane</b> 2. It has performed successfully as an anti-swooping measure at three UK sites monitored by the Transport Research Laboratory (M 20 /M 26 in Kent, M 6 J 4 a near Binningham and M 27 /M 3 near Southampton). Swooping is defined as vehicles cutting directly from lanes 2 or 3 or the maintine into the slip road in order to leave the mainline, typically within 500 m of the diverge point. In order to comb and confirm the objective data collected from the TRL video trial at the M 27 /M 3, a subsequent questionnaire survey was carried out between November 2000 and March 2001 on 54 drivers familiar with the Before and After layouts. Results showed a favourable response to the new layout in terms of drivers experiencing smoother flow, a reduction in last minute lane changes and easier access to the M 3. Recommendations were made with regards to incorporating these designs as standard diverge layouts as well as consulting drivers more extensively before any major new motorway junction schemes are implemented...|$|E
40|$|A turbo {{roundabout}} is {{a particular}} type of roundabout where all lanes are bounded by traffic signs and by non-mountable curbs installed at entering and circulating lanes. Turbo roundabouts also have a very particular shape to accomplish the splitting of traffic streams and to prevent cars weaving through. These aspects make turbo-roundabouts more appropriate than roundabouts when a higher level of safety has to be guaranteed, particularly in presence of relevant pedestrian and two-wheels traffic volumes. Only in some traffic conditions, turbo roundabouts can offer higher capacities than conventional double-lanes roundabouts, so if more capacity must be guarantee a bypass lane can be added to the turbo roundabouts layout. This paper presents a closed-form model for the estimation of capacity, delays and level of service of turbo-roundabout equipped with Right-turn bypass lanes, considering the effect of geometric <b>slip</b> <b>lane</b> schemes, control type, vehicular and pedestrian flow...|$|E
25|$|The {{motorway}} {{joins the}} M42 in both directions, with northbound traffic taking the left lane to exit eastbound, eventually forming the outer lanes of the M42 via a tight-bending two lane connecting road, {{and the right}} lanes being taken eastbound. Similarly, southbound, eastbound traffic from the M42 splits off from the outer two lanes, whereas westbound traffic of the M42 has a single lane, widening to a two <b>lane</b> <b>slip</b> road, which merges with the middle lane and forms the outer lane of the southbound M40.|$|R
60|$|Breaking {{the thought}} off abruptly, he passed down the dim {{hallway to the}} door of the club-rooms. He raised the axe and was about to smash the lock when he espied a key in the keyhole. The door was not locked. Lane set down the axe and noiselessly turned the knob and peeped in. The first room was dark, but the door on the {{opposite}} side was ajar, and through it Lane saw the larger lighted room and the shiny floor. Moving figures crossed the space. Removing the key, <b>Lane</b> <b>slipped</b> inside the room and locked the door. Then he tip-toed to the opposite door.|$|R
60|$|Several {{days passed}} before Lane felt himself {{equal to the}} momentous {{interview}} with Mel Iden. After his call upon Mel's father and mother he was overcome {{by one of his}} sick, weak spells, that happily had been infrequent of late. This one confined him to his room. He had about fought and won it out, when the old injury {{at the base of his}} spine reminded him that misfortunes did not come singly. Quite unexpectedly, as he bent over with less than his usual caution, the vertebra <b>slipped</b> out; and <b>Lane</b> found his body twisted like a letter S. And the old pain was no less terrible for its familiarity.|$|R
