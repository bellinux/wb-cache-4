5|$|In February 1965 Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin {{travelled}} to Hanoi {{to rebuild}} Soviet ties with North Vietnam, {{and the formation}} of a military alliance was on the agenda. Coincidentally, <b>senior</b> <b>security</b> adviser to the U.S. President McGeorge Bundy was also in Saigon to report on the political chaos in South Vietnam. In the shadow of those events, the Viet Cong 409th Battalion staged an attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965. This time, with his victory in the 1964 presidential election secured, Johnson decided to launch Operation Flaming Dart which entailed strikes on North Vietnamese military targets. However, with Kosygin still in Hanoi during the U.S bombing, the Soviet government decided to step up their military aid to North Vietnam, thereby signalling a major reversal of Khrushchev's policy in Vietnam.|$|E

They may not be arrested for nonpenal offenses, such as debt and civil offenses. Arrested individuals must also be allowed to contact their families and consult with attorneys. In practice, security officials routinely violated all of these requirements.|$|E

2500|$|An unnamed <b>senior</b> <b>security</b> {{official}} {{stated that}} about 30 U.S. Marines, {{scheduled to go}} to Afghanistan, were staying at the hotel, and they were {{believed to have been}} the targets of the bombing.

According to the Dawn, a number of the marines who stayed at the hotel sustained injuries; the newspaper also cited an unnamed law enforcement official stating [...] "personnel of a U.S. security agency" [...] were in all likelihood a target of the attack. There are also reports that more Americans were present at the hotel, as several senior CIA officers were visiting Islamabad {{at the time of the}} attack and were believed to be staying at the hotel, according to unnamed [...] "well placed sources". A 29 May 2009 press release from NSA reads: CTM3 Matthew J. O'Bryant, USN, a Navy Cryptologist, was assigned to Navy Information Operations Command (NIOC) Maryland.
