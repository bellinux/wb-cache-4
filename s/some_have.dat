5|$|Elaborate lattices {{are found}} in Indian Jaali work, carved in marble to adorn tombs and palaces. Chinese lattices, always with some symmetry, exist in 14 of the 17 {{wallpaper}} groups; they often have mirror, double mirror, or rotational symmetry. <b>Some</b> <b>have</b> a central medallion, and <b>some</b> <b>have</b> a border in a frieze group. Many Chinese lattices have been analysed mathematically by Daniel S. Dye; he identifies Sichuan as {{the centre of the}} craft.|$|E
5|$|A thru-hike {{generally}} requires five {{to seven}} months, although <b>some</b> <b>have</b> done it in three months, and several trail runners have completed the trail in less time. Trail runners typically tackle the AT with automobile support teams, without backpacks, and without camping in the woods.|$|E
5|$|Above the {{basement}} rise two storeys, ornamented with quatrefoils and niches originally holding about four hundred statues, with three hundred surviving until the mid-20th century. Since then, <b>some</b> <b>have</b> been restored or replaced, including the ruined figure of Christ in the gable.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} {{quite a bit of}} {{criticism}} of the World3 model. <b>Some</b> <b>has</b> come from the model creators themselves, <b>some</b> <b>has</b> come from economists and <b>some</b> <b>has</b> come from other places.|$|R
25|$|Many {{other types}} of tunnels were adapted for shelters to protect the civil population, and the {{military}} and administrative establishment in the UK during the war. <b>Some</b> <b>had</b> been built many years before, <b>some</b> <b>had</b> been part of an ancient defence system, and <b>some</b> <b>had</b> belonged to commercial enterprises, such as coalmining.|$|R
6000|$|We {{begun to}} meet swarms {{of folks who}} were coming back. <b>Some</b> <b>had</b> harps and nothing else; <b>some</b> <b>had</b> hymn-books and nothing else; <b>some</b> <b>had</b> nothing at all; all of them looked meek and uncomfortable; one young fellow hadn't {{anything}} left but his halo, and he was carrying that in his hand; {{all of a sudden}} he offered it to me and says-- ...|$|R
5|$|After Kamo's {{release from}} prison, {{he worked in}} the Soviet customs office, by some {{accounts}} because he was too unstable to work for the secret police. He died in 1922 when a truck hit him while he was cycling. Although there is no proof of foul play, <b>some</b> <b>have</b> theorized that Stalin ordered his death to keep him quiet.|$|E
5|$|After the war, all {{the cast}} members also disclaimed responsibility, {{pleading}} {{that they had}} been coerced into participating in the film. According to his biographer Friedrich Knilli, Marian never came to terms with his having accepted the role of Süß and became an alcoholic, dying shortly after the war in a 1946 car accident. <b>Some</b> <b>have</b> attributed the accident to suicide.|$|E
5|$|Any form {{of muscle}} damage of {{sufficient}} severity can cause rhabdomyolysis. Multiple causes can be present simultaneously in one person. <b>Some</b> <b>have</b> an underlying muscle condition, usually hereditary in nature, {{that makes them}} more prone to rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
50|$|There {{was some}} caudal fin variety among Stethacanthus species; while <b>some</b> <b>had</b> low angle heterocercal tails, <b>some</b> <b>had</b> tails {{approaching}} homocercal. The broad hypochordal lobe {{was supported by}} long, splayed fin radials.|$|R
5000|$|The Serbs {{were wearing}} {{camouflage}} uniforms, black masks, black gloves, and carrying automatic weapons. You {{could only see}} their mouth and two eyes. They had stripes with {{the colors of the}} Serbian flag falling loose. <b>Some</b> <b>had</b> their heads covered; <b>some</b> uncovered. <b>Some</b> <b>had</b> bandanas; I don’t remember the color. <b>Some</b> <b>had</b> short hair; <b>some</b> <b>had</b> long hair. They carried knives in their hands: straight knives bent at the end, about as wide as one’s arm, and two feet long[...] [...] [...] To look at them was scary. The Serbs weren’t driving military vehicles; they were driving cars stolen in Kosovo.|$|R
6000|$|I {{mentioned}} {{a great number}} of people whom I <b>had</b> formerly known. <b>Some</b> were dead, some were gone away, <b>some</b> <b>had</b> prospered, <b>some</b> <b>had</b> come to naught; but as regarded a dozen or so of the lot, the answer was comforting: ...|$|R
5|$|As {{leaders in}} the punk rock scene, the Ramones' music has usually been {{identified}} with that label, while <b>some</b> <b>have</b> defined their characteristic style more specifically as pop punk and others as power pop. In the 1980s, the band sometimes veered into hardcore punk territory, as can be heard on Too Tough to Die.|$|E
5|$|As of 2007, {{according}} to a report submitted on his behalf, Churchill has written 10 books on his own and co-authored 4. <b>Some</b> <b>have</b> been reprinted with updates. He has written 51 book chapters, 3 law reviews, and 50 scholarly essays; 27 of these were refereed. He has edited 4 volumes and co-edited 3 more.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{to generalize}} {{ordinary}} quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, {{so as to}} include gravity have led to serious problems. <b>Some</b> <b>have</b> argued that at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (quantum) field theory of gravity. At very high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly divergent and lead to models devoid of predictive power ("perturbative non-renormalizability").|$|E
5000|$|... 1950/51: Cosmos {{started making}} {{a type of}} small [...] "chariot"-type wetsub called Ippocampo (Italian for [...] "seahorse") for tourist and sports use. <b>Some</b> <b>had</b> a petrol engine with a long intake air hose to a float; <b>some</b> <b>had</b> a battery-electric engine.|$|R
60|$|All {{the costumes}} were not exactly alike. <b>Some</b> <b>had</b> more green, <b>some</b> <b>had</b> less. In <b>some</b> the {{sleeveless}} boleros {{were of a}} darker red, and <b>some</b> <b>had</b> poorer aprons, without such gorgeous bands at the bottom. And some were evidently old: probably thirty years old: still perfect and in keeping, reserved for Sunday and high holidays. A few were darker, ruddier than the true vermilion. This varying of the tone intensified {{the beauty of the}} shuffling woman-host.|$|R

5|$|Branham's {{father was}} an alcoholic, and William Branham often talked about how his {{upbringing}} was difficult and impoverished. As a child, he would often wear a coat, held closed by safety pins, without a shirt underneath. <b>Some</b> <b>have</b> called his claims of poverty into question, because, among other things, {{he was able to}} purchase a new car when he was 18 years old.|$|E
5|$|Chickadees and titmice {{are mainly}} small stocky {{woodland}} species with short stout bills. <b>Some</b> <b>have</b> crests. They are adaptable birds, with a mixed diet including seeds and insects.|$|E
5|$|Critics have derided {{the novel}} for being {{derivative}} of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. <b>Some</b> <b>have</b> accused Brooks of lifting the entire plot {{and many of}} his characters directly from Lord of the Rings; others have praised its execution despite the lack of originality.|$|E
60|$|The Catholics were, for {{the most}} part, roughly armed. <b>Some</b> <b>had</b> pikes, <b>some</b> <b>had</b> swords, others axes, choppers, or clubs; but none now thought of defence. The arms that had been brought out {{for the work of}} murder were thrown away, and there was no thought, save of flight.|$|R
50|$|In {{most cases}} this {{requires}} {{at least a}} three-room setup, comprising a live studio, a server/software room, and an analyst’s room. The configuration of these rooms varies from casino to casino, with <b>some</b> <b>having</b> several gaming tables in one room, and <b>some</b> <b>having</b> a single table in each room.|$|R
60|$|They were {{plump and}} {{comfortable}} looking, and Dot {{had no idea}} {{there were so many}} kinds and colors of pussys in the world. <b>Some</b> <b>had</b> long, silky hair, and some short, velvety hair; <b>some</b> <b>had</b> long, bushy tails, some short tails and some no tails at all. They were white and black, blue and gray, yellow and red, speckled and tortoise-shell in color. <b>Some</b> <b>had</b> pretty ribbons around their necks and some of the older ones wore spectacles; but all were as neat as wax, and seemed well cared for.|$|R
5|$|Dark beers {{are usually}} brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base {{with a small}} {{proportion}} of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade. Other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers. Very dark beers, such as stout, use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer. <b>Some</b> <b>have</b> roasted unmalted barley.|$|E
5|$|Domestic {{horses were}} brought to Canada by humans, but <b>some</b> <b>have</b> since {{established}} feral populations. There are approximately 2,000 wild horses in western Canada and another 300 on Sable Island. See free-roaming horse management in North America.|$|E
5|$|Dsungaripterids are {{traditionally}} {{thought of as}} being specialist molluscivores, using their powerful jaws to crush the shells of molluscs and crustaceans. While this remains the dominant view of dsungaripterid paleobiology today, <b>some</b> <b>have</b> suggested that they were generalistic omnivores eating a variety of hard foods, as dsungaripterids are better adapted to terrestrial movement rather than wading and are found in inland deposits.|$|E

5|$|During Tkach's tenure, {{the changes}} that he {{implemented}} stirred much controversy and significant dissent among those who continued to follow Armstrong's theology. The dissenters labeled the changes as heresy and many left to form new church organizations. Within the mainstream Christian community, <b>some</b> <b>have</b> hailed Tkach's reforms, which brought a church from the fringe to orthodoxy, as unprecedented.|$|E
5|$|Florence Harding became deeply {{involved}} in her husband's career, both at the Star and once he entered politics. Exhibiting her father's determination and business sense, she helped turn the Star into a profitable enterprise through her tight management of the paper's circulation department. She has been credited with helping Harding achieve more than he might have alone; <b>some</b> <b>have</b> suggested that she pushed {{him all the way}} to the White House.|$|E
5|$|Following Marsh, Ceratopsia has {{usually been}} {{classified}} as a suborder within the order Ornithischia. While ranked taxonomy has largely fallen out of favor among dinosaur paleontologists, some researchers have continued to employ such a classification, though sources have differed on what its rank should be. Most who still employ the use of ranks have retained its traditional ranking of suborder, though <b>some</b> <b>have</b> reduced {{to the level of}} infraorder.|$|E
50|$|Cabbage Patch Ponies toys {{were made}} by Hasbro, which had a license to {{manufacture}} Cabbage Patch Kids from 1988 until 1994. They were made of rubber and came in different colors; <b>some</b> <b>had</b> glittery bodies. <b>Some</b> <b>had</b> hair that could be combed, while others had yarn for hair.
