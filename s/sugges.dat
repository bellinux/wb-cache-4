40|$|We {{describe}} a hippocampal neural {{model in which}} spatio-temporal features of the environment are extracted by visually driven neurons. The neuronal firing activity implicitly measures properties like agent-landmark distance and egocentric orientation to visual cues. This leads to a neural representation where populations of place cells encode spatial locations within the environment. In addition, temporally asymmetric long-term potentiation of synapses between place cells is used to learn a vector field representation providing a navigational map. We present experimental results obtained by testing our model with the mobile Khepera robot. 1 Introduction Navigation of perceptually complex animals relies on (more or less explicit) spatial representation.

40|$|This thesis compares rough sets theory #RS# and {{principal}} component analysis #PCA# used for preprocessing coarsely discrete numerical datasets for classi#ers based on neural networks #NN#. Preprocessing the training data will often improve the learning time of NN. For numerical datasets, PCA has a long and proven record of being a competent frontend to NN. Recently, RS has been suggested for reducing the dimensionality of nominal datasets. Many datasets are characterised by having only coarsely discrete numerical values, and both PCA and RS are potential candidates for reducing such datasets. The result of the experiments in this thesis shows that, for the particular classi #cation problems studied, RS is a competent alternative to PCA as a frontend to NN when the dataset contains coarsely discrete numerical values.
