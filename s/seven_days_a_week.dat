40|$|This paper aims to {{show how}} bird {{behaviour}} {{can be used to}} guide best practice bird management plans for landfill sites. Bird hazards at landfill sites represent {{one of the most significant}} yet predominantly controllable off-airfield concerns for flight safety. ICAO standards provide airport operators with the opportunity to attempt to eliminate such hazards from the environment surrounding their aerodrome. Bird numbers were recorded at five landfill sites with active integrated deterrence regimes in place and at a landfill site with bird exclusion netting. Both netting and integrated strategies delivered highly effective levels of control although breakdown frequencies and amounts varied. Behavioural observations of birds showed that active systems can be significantly improved by ensuring dawn to dusk, <b>seven</b> <b>day</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> deterrence is implemented and that netting systems can be improved by ensuring adequate maintenance and back-up control is specified within management plans. Irregular failures in control do not generally result in birds utilising a site. Nevertheless, failures should be rectified immediately if birds are noted around a site or within 3 hours if not. Gulls required only 20 minutes of cumulative foraging time on a landfill site to meet their daily energy requirements. Spo...|$|R
