40|$|We report {{continuing}} {{investigations into}} practical {{applications of the}} ac Josephson effect {{as the basis for}} a voltage-tunable radio-frequency oscillator. We have previously demonstrated experimentally that useful power levels (10 s of nW) and linewidths of a few kHz can be achieved in the heterodyne output from a High-Temperature-Superconducting Resistive SQUID (HTS-RSQUID) operating in the frequency range 1 - 50 MHz.

25|$|Every inline series-connected ammeter, {{including}} a multimeter in a current range, {{has a certain}} resistance. Most multimeters inherently measure voltage, and pass a current to be measured through a shunt resistance, measuring the voltage developed across it. The voltage drop {{is known as the}} burden voltage, specified in volts per ampere. The value can change depending on the range the meter selects, since different ranges usually use different <b>shunt</b> <b>resistors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{common and}} simple {{approach}} to current sensing {{is the use}} of a <b>shunt</b> <b>resistor.</b> The voltage drop across the shunt is proportional to its current flow. Both alternating currents (AC) and direct currents (DC) can be measured with the shunt resistor.The high performance coaxial shunt have been widely used for many applications fast rise-time transient currents and high amplitudes but, highly integrated electronic devices prefer low-cost surface mounted devices (SMDs), because of their small sizes and relatively low prices.The parasitic inductance present in the shunt affects high precision current measurement. Although this affects only the magnitude of the impedance at relatively high frequency, but also its effect on the phase at line frequency causes a noticeable error at a low power factor. The low cost and high reliability make the low resistance current shunt a very popular choice for current measurement system. The major disadvantage of using the shunt is that fundamentally a shunt is a resistive element, the power loss is thus proportional to the square of the current passing through it and consequently it is a rarity amongst high current measurements.Fast-response for measuring high-impulse or heavy-surge currents is the common requirement for shunt resistors. In 1981 Malewski, designed a circuit to eliminate the skin effect and later in 1999 the flap-strap sandwich shunt (FSSS) was introduced from a flat-strap sandwich resistor. The properties of the FSSS in terms of response time, power loss and frequency characteristics, are the same as the <b>shunt</b> <b>resistor</b> but the cost is lower and the construction technique is less sophisticated, compared to Malewski and the coaxial shunt.|$|E

Modification to read standby power has been described and discussed in detail (with oscilloscope waveforms and measurements). Essentially, the meter's <b>shunt</b> <b>resistor,</b> used to generate a voltage proportional to load current, {{is replaced by a}} much larger value, typically 100 times larger, with protective diodes.

5000|$|A {{wattmeter}} is used {{to measure}} electrical power. Inexpensive plugin wattmeters, sometimes described as energy monitors, are available from prices of around US$10. Some more expensive models for home use have remote display units. In the US wattmeters can often also be borrowed from local power authorities or a local public library. [...] Although accuracy of measurement of low AC current and quantities derived from it, such as power, is often poor, these devices are nevertheless indicative of standby power, if sensitive enough to register it. Some home power monitors simply specify an error figure such as 0.2%, without specifying the parameter subject to this error (e.g., voltage, easy to measure), and without qualification. Errors of measurement at the low standby powers used from about 2010 (i.e., less than a few watts) may be a very {{large percentage of the}} actual value—accuracy is poor. Modification of such meters to read standby power has been described and discussed in detail (with oscilloscope waveforms and measurements). Essentially, the meter's <b>shunt</b> <b>resistor,</b> used to generate a voltage proportional to load current, is replaced by one of value typically 100 times larger, with protective diodes.

40|$|We {{investigated}} current-voltage {{characteristics of}} unshunted and externally shunted Josephson junctions (JJs) with high critical current densities, Jc, {{in order to}} extract their basic parameters and statistical characteristics for JJ modeling in superconducting integrated circuits and to assess their potential for future technology nodes. Nb/AlOx-Al/Nb JJs with diameters from 0. 5 μm to 6 μm were fabricated using a fully planarized process with Mo or MoNx thin-film <b>shunt</b> <b>resistors</b> with sheet resistance Rsq = 2 Ω/sq and Rsq = 6 Ω/sq, respectively. We used our standard MIT LL process SFQ 5 ee to fabricate JJs with Jc = 0. 1 mA/μm^ 2 and our new process SFQ 5 hs to make JJs with Jc = 0. 2 mA/μm^ 2 and higher current densities up to about 1 mA/μm^ 2. Using LRC resonance features on the I-V characteristics of shunted JJs, we extract the inductance associated with molybdenum <b>shunt</b> <b>resistors</b> of 1. 4 pH/sq. The main part this inductance, about 1. 1 pH/sq, is the inductance of the 40 -nm Mo resistor film, while the geometrical inductance of superconducting Nb wiring contributes the rest. We attribute this large inductance to kinetic inductance arising from the complex conductivity of a thin normal-metal film in an electromagnetic field with angular frequency ω, σ(ω) =σ 0 /(1 +iωτ), where σ 0 is the static conductivity and τ the electron scattering time. Using a resonance in a large-area unshunted high-Jc junction excited by a resistively coupled small-area shunted JJ, we extract the Josephson plasma frequency and specific capacitance of high-Jc junctions in 0. 1 to 1 mA/μm^ 2 Jc range. We also present data on Jc targeting and JJ critical current spreads.

50|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{resistance of}} a conducting element, usually a copper trace in Printed circuit Board(PCB) can use {{be used as}} sensing element instead of a <b>shunt</b> <b>resistor.</b> Since no additional resistor is required this approach promises a low-cost and space saving configuration with no additional power losses either. Naturally, the voltage drop of a copper trace is very low due to its very low resistance, making {{the presence of a}} high gain amplifier mandatory {{in order to get a}} useful signal.There are several physical effects which may alter the current measurement process: thermal drift of the copper trace, initial conditions of the trace resistance etc. Therefore, this approach is not suitable for applications that require a reasonable accuracy due to the large thermal drift. In order to overcome the problems associated with the temperature drift, a digital controller can be used for thermal drift compensation and calibration of the copper trace.A significant drawback of this kind of current sensor is the unavoidable electrical connection between the current to be measured and the sense circuit. By employing a so-called isolation amplifier, electrical isolation can be added. However, these amplifiers are expensive and can also deteriorate the bandwidth, accuracy and thermal drift of the original current sensing technique. For these reasons, current sensing techniques based on physical principles that provide intrinsic electrical isolation deliver a better performance at lower costs in applications where isolation is required.|$|E
5000|$|To equalise long video lines, {{a network}} with Cauer {{topology}} {{is used as}} the Z impedance of a Zobel constant resistance network. Just as the input impedance of a Bode network is used as the Z impedance of a Zobel network to form a Zobel Bode equaliser, so the input impedance of a Cauer network is {{used to make a}} Zobel Cauer equaliser. The equaliser is required to correct an attenuation increasing with frequency and for this a Cauer ladder network consisting of series resistors and shunt capacitors is required. Optionally, there may be an inductor included in series with the first capacitor which increases the equalisation at the high end due to the steeper slope produced as resonance is approached. This may be required on longer lines. The <b>shunt</b> <b>resistor</b> R1 provides the basic loss of the Zobel network in the usual way.The dual of a RC Cauer network is a LR Cauer network which is required for the Z' impedance as shown in the example. Adjustment is a bit problematic with this equaliser. In order to maintain the constant resistance, the pairs of components C1/L1', C2/L2' etc., must remain dual impedances as the component is adjusted, so both parts of the pair must be adjusted together. With the Zobel Bode equaliser, this is a simple matter of ganging two pots together - a component configuration available off-the-shelf. Ganging together a variable capacitor and inductor is not, however, a very practical solution. These equalisers tend to be [...] "hand built", one solution being to select the capacitors on test and fit fixed values according to the measurements and then adjust the inductors until the required match is achieved. The furthest element of the ladder from the driving point is equalising the lowest frequency of interest. This is adjusted first as it will also have an effect on higher frequencies and from there progressively higher frequencies are adjusted working along the ladder towards the driving point.|$|E
