25|$|The prince {{next came}} across a railway <b>switchman</b> who told him how {{passengers}} constantly rushed {{from one place to}} another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and not knowing what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to look out the windows. A merchant then talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated thirst, which was very popular, saving people fifty-three minutes a week. The prince replied that he would instead gladly use that extra time to go around finding fresh water, again underscoring the materialism and lack of spirituality of a world that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to fight}} both {{soldiers}} and scabs without help, the <b>switchmen</b> ended their strike on August 25, 1892. The <b>switchmen</b> agreed {{to return to}} work, but the railroads blacklisted most of the workers.|$|R

25|$|Born in Isabel in Edgar County {{in eastern}} Illinois, Hunt visited Wyoming {{for the first}} time as a semi-professional {{baseball}} player. He graduated from Illinois Wesleyan University and then worked as a railroad <b>switchman</b> to put himself through dental school at Saint Louis University. After graduating in 1917, he moved to Lander, Wyoming, and established a practice. He joined the United States Army Dental Corps when the United States entered World War I, and served as a lieutenant from 1917 to 1919. After postgraduate study at Northwestern University in 1920, Hunt resumed his practice in Lander. He was president of the Wyoming State Dental Society and began his career in government when appointed as president of the Wyoming State Board of Dental Examiners, serving from 1924 to 1928.|$|E
25|$|In July 1919 Wedge {{moved from}} El Paso to Tucson, Arizona {{to begin his}} studies at the University of Arizona. Initially Wedge worked as a <b>switchman</b> for the Southern Railroad for eight hours each night from midnight. By January 1920 Wedge was {{employed}} as a clerk at the Southern Railroad, and lived in a boarding house on East 13th Street, Tucson {{with his wife and}} son. After twelve months at the University, Wedge completed his course requirements and graduated in June 1920 with a Bachelor of Arts degree where he studied Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and the sciences. Wedge was able to speak six languages. In Spring 1921 Wedge's application for admission was accepted to the Graduate School of Education at Harvard University, where he planned to earn a Ph.D. in social and educational psychology. To earn sufficient funds to study at Harvard, Wedge accepted the position as the principal of the Union High School in Benson, Arizona.|$|E

25|$|The strike {{began to}} collapse. The railroads brought in {{hundreds}} of strikebreakers. Striking <b>switchmen</b> were beaten by troops and Erie County sheriff's deputies. Troops broke up mass meetings, clubbing workers with the butts of their rifles. The violence led <b>switchmen</b> on the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (known by the pronunciation of its acronym as the 'Nickel Plate') and the New York Central Railroad to strike in sympathy.|$|R
25|$|On August 12, <b>switchmen</b> in the Buffalo railyards {{struck the}} Lehigh Valley Railroad, the Erie Railroad and the Buffalo Creek Railroad after the {{companies}} refused {{to obey the}} new law.|$|R
50|$|Strikebreakers {{were hired}} by the railway {{in order to keep}} the line open, many of whom had little railway experience, making the already {{dangerous}} job of coupling and uncoupling cars performed by <b>switchmen</b> in the yards and on the sidings even more deadly. Consequently, the strike against the CB&Q was joined on March 23 by the members of the SMAA. The railway brakemen remained on the job, however, helping to operate the trains of the CB&Q while the three brotherhoods of the running trades were on strike, although the level ill feeling on the part of striking engineers, firemen, and <b>switchmen</b> towards the brakemen was said to be comparatively small.|$|R
2500|$|On April 26 {{sabotage}} {{caused the}} derailment of {{a freight train}} near Wyandotte, Kansas, where two non-striking crewmembers were buried in wreckage and the mud of the Kaw River.

And on April 8 a striker named John Gibbons was fatally shot by a [...] "non-union <b>switchman</b> and private watchman" [...] in St. Louis.|$|E
2500|$|Limiting the locomotive's success {{were several}} {{mechanical}} and ergonomic drawbacks. [...] The mechanical components within the engine compartment {{were difficult to}} access and maintain, reducing its appeal among railroad shop crews. [...] The locomotive's carbody lacked the full-length walkways of a true switch engine (a mistake not repeated on the subsequent [...] "GP" [...] series of diesels or other road switchers), {{making it difficult for}} the brakeman or <b>switchman</b> to move from one point on the locomotive to another during switching operations. [...] Finally, although the industrial designers at EMD tried to build a carbody that evoked high-class passenger trains while retaining the utilitarianism of railroad work, the visual design never quite became popular. [...] Even though the BL2 wasn't very successful, EMD's engineers learned much from the endeavor, and incorporated all of the good ideas from it into the company's widely successful GP series of locomotives.|$|E
2500|$|On April 19, 1966, Speck {{returned}} {{to stay at}} his sister Martha's second-floor apartment at 3966 N. Avondale Ave. in the Old Irving Park neighborhood on the Northwest side of Chicago, where she lived with her husband, Gene Thornton, and their two teenage daughters. Martha {{had worked as a}} registered nurse in pediatrics before she was married and her husband Gene worked nights as a railroad <b>switchman.</b> Speck told them an unbelievable story about having to leave Monmouth after refusing to sell narcotics for a [...] "crime syndicate" [...] there. Gene Thornton, who had served in the U.S. Navy, thought that the U.S. Merchant Marine might provide a suitable occupation for his unemployed brother-in-law, so on April 25 he took Speck to the U.S. Coast Guard office to apply for a letter of authority to work as an apprentice seaman. The application required being fingerprinted and photographed, and having a physical examination by a physician.|$|E

2500|$|Lee Bowers, a {{railroad}} <b>switchman</b> {{who was sitting}} in a two-story tower, had an unobstructed view of the rear of the stockade fence atop the grassy knoll during the shooting. He saw a total of four men in the area between his tower and Elm Street: a middle-aged man and a younger man, standing [...] apart near the triple underpass, who did not seem to know each other, and one or two uniformed parking lot attendants. At the time of the shooting, he saw [...] "something out of the ordinary, a sort of milling around", which he could not identify. Bowers testified that {{one or both of the}} men were still there when motorcycle officer Clyde Haygood ran up the grassy knoll to the back of the fence. In a 1966 interview, Bowers clarified that the two men he saw were standing in the opening between the pergola and the fence, and that [...] "no one" [...] was behind the fence at the time the shots were fired.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of January 15, 1953, the Pennsylvania Railroad's Federal, the {{overnight}} train from Boston, crashed into the station. [...] When the engineer tried to apply the trainline brakes two miles out of the platforms, he discovered that he only had engine brakes. A <b>switchman</b> on the approach to the station noticed the runaway train and telephoned a warning to the station, as the train coasted downhill into track 16. The GG1 locomotive, No. 4876, hit the bumper block at about , jumped onto the platform, destroyed the stationmaster’s office {{at the end of}} the track, took out a newsstand, and was on its way to crashing through the wall into the Great Hall. Just then, the floor of the terminal, having never been designed to carry the weight of a locomotive, gave way, dropping the engine into the basement. The [...] electric locomotive fell into about the center of what is now the food court. Remarkably, no one was killed, and passengers in the rear cars thought that they had only had a rough stop. An investigation revealed that an anglecock on the brakeline had been closed, probably by an icicle knocked from an overhead bridge. The accident inspired the finale of the 1976 film Silver Streak. The durable design of the GG1 made its damage repairable, and it was soon back in service after being hauled away in pieces to the PRR's main shops in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Before the latter action was undertaken, however, the GG1 and the hole it made were temporarily planked over and hidden from view due to the imminent inauguration of General Dwight D. Eisenhower as the thirty-fourth President of the United States.|$|E

60|$|Where he {{gets his}} English is his own secret. There is nothing like it {{elsewhere}} in the earth; or even in paradise, perhaps, but the other place is probably full of it. You hire {{him as soon as}} you touch Indian soil; for no matter what your sex is, you cannot do without him. He is messenger, valet, chambermaid, table-waiter, lady's maid, courier--he is everything. He carries a coarse linen clothes-bag and a quilt; he sleeps on the stone floor outside your chamber door, and gets his meals you do not know where nor when; you only know that he is not fed on the premises, either when you are in a hotel or when you are a guest in a private house. His wages are large--from an Indian point of view--and he feeds and clothes himself out of them. We had three of him in two and a half months. The first one's rate was thirty rupees a month that is to say, twenty-seven cents a day; the rate of the others, Rs. 40 (40 rupees) a month. A princely sum; for the native <b>switchman</b> on a railway and the native servant in a private family get only Rs. 7 per month, and the farm-hand only 4. The two former feed and clothe themselves and their families on their $1.90 per month; but I cannot believe that the farmhand has to feed himself on his $1.08. I think the farm probably feeds him, and that the whole of his wages, except a trifle for the priest, go to the support of his family. That is, to the feeding of his family; for they live in a mud hut, hand-made, and, doubtless, rent-free, and they wear no clothes; at least, nothing more than a rag. And not much of a rag at that, {{in the case of the}} males. However, these are handsome times for the farm-hand; he was not always the child of luxury that he is now. The Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces, in a recent official utterance wherein he was rebuking a native deputation for complaining of hard times, reminded them that they could easily remember when a farm-hand's wages were only half a rupee (former value) a month--that is to say, less than a cent a day; nearly $2.90 a year. If such a wage-earner had a good deal of a family--and they all have that, for God is very good to these poor natives in some ways--he would save a profit of fifteen cents, clean and clear, out of his year's toil; I mean a frugal, thrifty person would, not one given to display and ostentation. And if he owed $13.50 and took good care of his health, he could pay it off in ninety years. Then he could hold up his head, and look his creditors in the face again.|$|E

6000|$|I {{say this}} woman seemed {{glad to be}} greeted in Italian, but not, so far as I could see, surprised; and {{altogether}} {{the most amazing thing}} about my doorstep acquaintance of her nation is, that they are never surprised to be spoken to in their own tongue, or, if they are, never show it. A chestnut-roaster, who has sold me twice the chestnuts the same money would have bought of him in English, has not otherwise recognized the fact that Tuscan is not the dialect of Charlesbridge, and the mortifying nonchalance with which my advances have always been received has long since persuaded me that to the grinder at the gate it is not remarkable that a man should open the door of his wooden house on Benicia Street, and welcome him in his native language. After the first shock of this indifference is past, it is not to be questioned but it flatters with an illusion, which a stare of amazement would forbid, reducing the encounter to a vulgar reality at once, and I could almost believe it in those wily and amiable folk to intend the sweeter effect of their unconcern, which tacitly implies that there is no other tongue in the world but Italian, and which makes all the earth and air Italian for the time. Nothing else could have been the purpose of that image-dealer whom I saw on a summer's day lying at the foot of one of our meeting-houses, and doing his best to make it a cathedral, and really giving a sentiment of medieval art to the noble sculptures of the facade which the carpenters had just nailed up, freshly painted and newly repaired. This poet was stretched upon his back, eating, in that convenient posture, his dinner out of an earthen pot, plucking the viand from it, whatever it was, with his thumb and fore-finger, and dropping it piecemeal into his mouth. When the passer asked him [...] "Where are you from?" [...] he held a morsel in air long enough to answer [...] "Da Lucca, signore," [...] and then let it fall into his throat, and sank deeper into a reverie in which that crude accent even must have sounded like a gossip's or a kinsman's voice, but never otherwise moved muscle, nor looked to see who passed or lingered. There could have been little else in his circumstances to remind him of home, and if he was really in the sort of day-dream attributed to him, he was wise not to look about him. I have not myself been in Lucca, but I conceive that its piazza is not like our square, with a pump and horse-trough in the midst; but that it has probably a fountain and statuary, though not possibly so magnificent an elm towering above the bronze or marble groups as spreads its boughs of benison over our pump and the horse-car <b>switchman,</b> loitering near it to set the switch for the arriving cars, or lift the brimming buckets to the smoking nostrils of the horses, while out from the stable comes clanging and banging with a fresh team that famous African who has turned white, or, if he is off duty, one of his brethren who has not yet begun to turn. Figure, besides, an expressman watering his horse at the trough, a provision-cart backed up against the curb {{in front of one of}} the stores, various people looking from the car-office windows, and a conductor appearing at the door long enough to call out, [...] "Ready for Boston!"--and you have a scene of such gayety as Lucca could never have witnessed in her piazza at high noon on a summer's day. Even our Campo Santo, if the Lucchese had cared to look round the corner of the meeting-house at its moss-grown head stones, could have had little to remind him of home, though it has antiquity and a proper quaintness. But not for him, not for them of his clime and faith, is the pathos of those simple memorial slates with their winged skulls, changing upon many later stones, as if by the softening of creeds and customs, to cherub's heads,--not for him is the pang I feel because of those who died, in our country's youth exiles or exiles' children, heirs of the wilderness and toil and hardship. Could they rise from their restful beds, and look on this wandering Italian with his plaster statuettes of Apollo, and Canovan dancers and deities, they would hold his wares little better than Romish saints and idolatries, and would scarcely have the sentimental interest in him felt by the modern citizen of Charlesbridge; but I think that even they must have respected that Lombard scissors-grinder who used to come to us, and put an edge to all the cutlery in the house.|$|E
