5|$|Monotype later {{created a}} bold and bold italic (called a <b>semi-bold</b> in some digitisations) {{to match the}} roman and italic of the {{original}} release. (True bold type {{did not exist in}} Kis's time.) Released in 1967, Fleet Titling was a capitals-only alphabet intended to serve as a companion for titling use. It was created by Monotype's occasional collaborator John Peters, a Cambridge University Press designer who also worked as a private printer. Monotype used it for their logo and letterhead. More oddly, Monotype in the 1960s used Ehrhardt as a base for printing in the Initial Teaching Alphabet. This alphabet system, intended to be used to teach children to read, used alternative characters for different sounds spelled with the same letter, like t's and c's dropped below the baseline of the text.|$|E

5000|$|Trajanus Antiqua (roman) + Trajanus Kursiv (italic) + Trajanus Halbfett (<b>semi-bold)</b> (1939, Stempel + Linotype (Frankfurt)), {{named for}} the same Roman emperor as Carol Twombly's Trajan but a very {{different}} design, being a Medieval. See Fr. Edward Catich's research {{for more on the}} origin of the typeface Trajan. The <b>semi-bold</b> weight however, was prepared by the foundry, Chappell having only made drawings (starting with a broad nibbed pen, then refining the contours using opaque white as if using an engraver) for the roman and italic designs. The Huxley House specimen book for it was featured in an AIGA design annual.|$|E
50|$|Josef Týfa first {{published}} the Academia typeface in 1967-68. It was the winning design from competition aimed at new typeface for scientific texts, announced by Grafotechna. It was cut and cast in metal in 1968 in 8 and 10 point sizes of plain, italic and <b>semi-bold</b> designs.|$|E
5000|$|... (optional) example {{phrases and}} {{sentences}} in <b>semi-bold</b> italicized pinyin, but without characters, which users can find through alphabetic lookup, followed by English renderings in Roman type (e.g., [...] "1tóutòng 头痛 [...] {{have a headache}} Zhè shì zhēn ràng rén ~! This gives one a real headache!") ...|$|E
5000|$|Sized between 11 and 13 points (96 dpi), glyphs have {{inconsistent}} stroke weight {{without the}} activation of ClearType. Sometimes, {{especially on the}} Mac OS X and Linux platforms, these problems can sometimes be avoided by displaying fonts in <b>semi-bold</b> or bold as their normal (lightest) font weight.|$|E
50|$|Open Sans is {{available}} in {{a large number of}} variants. There are five weights (300 Light, 400 Normal, <b>Semi-Bold</b> 600, Bold 700 and Extra Bold 800), each of them with an italic version, totaling ten variants. There is also a separate font called Open Sans Condensed with 3 width variations.|$|E
50|$|Software {{that enables}} to {{calculate}} interpolations and extrapolations between one light and one bold font version was than added {{and made it}} possible to create fonts such as ultra-light, <b>semi-bold</b> and extra bold variations. This invention drastically reduced time and effort for font manufacturers to create these intermediate fonts and was frequently used, particularly in Japan.|$|E
50|$|Some {{principles}} from RNIB's guidelines 'See It Right' {{are transferred}} directly to stave notation in MSN. The staves and note stem thickness correspond to a thickness of letters in 16 point typefaces. Spaces between systems and between staves within a system are sufficiently large, although more use {{is made of}} left and right margins. Text is sans serif, <b>semi-bold</b> or bold.|$|E
50|$|Microsoft {{licensed}} {{rights to}} Verdana to Font Bureau {{for a new}} Verdana Pro release, published in 2013. Verdana Pro adds light, <b>semi-bold</b> and black styles with italics, as well as condensed styles with italics across all weights. The expanded family was designed for organisations which had made extensive use of Verdana due to its availability but desired additional versions for greater flexibility. It is sold separately through print and web licenses, being sold by Font Bureau and Ascender. A similar Georgia Pro release was announced at the same time.|$|E

50|$|There {{presently}} exist two modern releases, by Monotype and Lanston Type (LTC). Monotype’s current {{release is}} much larger than that included with Microsoft products, and includes additional light, <b>semi-bold,</b> extra- and ultra-bold styles. Even less commonly seen are the quirky Art Deco-influenced display alphabet Twentieth Century Poster, intended to be complementary, and Twentieth Century Classified, a small print design with a very high x-height. This veers away from the strict geometry of the main design, featuring a more conventional double-story ‘a’, presumably to be more legible. A similar design was offered by Linotype’s Spartan, which may be an influence. Lanston's design is in a narrower range of styles, but includes a set of additional stylistic alternates and small capitals. LTC has also digitised other Hess sans-serif designs, such as Jefferson Gothic (a titling caps design similar to Twentieth Century Poster, but more condensed) and Tourist Gothic (an earlier grotesque design, to which Hess also added rounded caps). Twentieth Century Poster has also been revived under the name as Renard Moderne by the company Nick's Fonts, a release that includes small capitals as a lower case.|$|E
50|$|Despite Carter's {{training}} {{in the art of}} traditional punchcutting, his career developed at a time when metal type was rapidly being displaced by phototypesetting. This reduced the cost of designing and using a wide range of typefaces, since type could be stored on reels of film rather than as blocks of expensively-engraved metal. In a book on Carter's career, historian James Mosley, {{a few years older than}} Carter, would write of the period of their upbringing:The Monotype classic fonts dominated the typographical landscape...in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type...seemed at last to be happening.'Carter eventually returned to London where he became a freelancer. By 1961 Carter was able to use the skills he acquired to cut his own version of the <b>semi-bold</b> typeface Dante. An early example of his work is the masthead logo he designed for the British magazine Private Eye in May 1962, still in use. Previously the lettering had been different for the masthead of each issue; it was based on a font ('a bit of nameless juvenilia') which was never ultimately published. He also did early work for Heathrow Airport.|$|E
40|$|Make Perhaps This Out Sense of Can You contextualises Bob Cobbing’s {{work as a}} poet as well as {{looking at}} his legacy as an organiser. The day is built around {{concerns}} that continue to be relevant today, such as the value of artist-led publishing initiatives, the productive qualities of an archive, the role of regional arts centres, and the intersections between art, literature and music. Make Perhaps This Out Sense of Can You is programmed by William Cobbing and Rosie Cooper and presented by Camberwell, Chelsea & Wimbledon (CCW) Graduate School. A special screen printed poster was designed for the symposium by Camberwell BA graphics students Louis Hodge and Tom Stone, utilising the <b>Semi-bold</b> Flaxman letterpress, located at the letterpress workshop at Camberwell College of Arts. The symposium coincided with the Raven Row event 'Bob Cobbiiiiiiiiing Live', an evening celebrating the work of Bob Cobbing, with performances by Brian Catling, Beth Collar, Hannah Silva and David Toop...|$|E
