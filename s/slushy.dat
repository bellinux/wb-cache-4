On 29 March 1843, Macdonald celebrated his first election victory, with 156 votes against 43 for his opponent, a Colonel Jackson. He also suffered what he termed his first downfall, as his supporters, carrying the victorious candidate, accidentally dropped him onto a <b>slushy</b> street.|$|E
5|$|In the 1903 CAHL season, Ottawa and the Montreal Victorias both {{finished}} {{in first place}} with 6–2 records. The top scorers were the Victorias' Russell Bowie, who scored seven goals in one game and six in another, and McGee, whose top performance saw him score five goals in a game. The two clubs faced off in a two-game total goals series to decide the league championship and Stanley Cup. The first game, played in Montreal on <b>slushy</b> ice that made it a desperate struggle to score, ended 1–1. The return match in Ottawa, witnessed by three thousand fans, was on ice coated with an inch of water. The conditions did not hinder Ottawa, as they won 8–0, with McGee scoring three goals and the other five shared among the three Gilmour brothers, Dave (3), Suddy (1) and Bill (1), to win their first Cup. This started {{a period in which}} the team held the Stanley Cup and defeated all challengers until March 1906.|$|E

25|$|Thawing {{conditions}} can impair mobility and put soldiers {{at risk of}} trench foot by creating mud {{on the ground and}} by the weakening and breakup ice cover on bodies of water. Maintaining roads becomes more difficult during spring thaw run off and requires mud removal by heavy equipment. <b>Slushy</b> and muddy ground causes clothing and equipment to become wet, damp and dirty. Muddy conditions greatly inhibited Napoleon's ability to maneuver in Russia and also the German attempt to take Moscow in World War II.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects on}} the Interior of British Columbia when a Chinook is in effect are the reverse. In a rainy spell, most of the heavy {{moisture}} will be soaked out by the ramparts of mountains before the air mass reaches the Fraser Canyon and the Thompson River-Okanagan area. The effects {{are similar to those}} of an Alberta Chinook, though not to the same extreme, in part because the Okanagan is relatively warmer than the Prairies, and because of the additional number of precipitation-catching mountain ranges between Kelowna and Calgary. When the Chinook brings snow to the coast during a period of coastal cold, bright but chilly weather in the interior will give way to a <b>slushy</b> melting of snow, more due to the warm spell than because of rain.|$|E
25|$|In general, cloud-to-ground (CG) {{lightning}} flashes {{account for}} only 25% of all total lightning flashes worldwide. Since {{the base of a}} thunderstorm is usually negatively charged, this is where most CG lightning originates. This region is typically at the elevation where freezing occurs within the cloud. Freezing, combined with collisions between ice and water, appears to be a critical part of the initial charge development and separation process. During wind-driven collisions, ice crystals tend to develop a positive charge, while a heavier, <b>slushy</b> mixture of ice and water (called graupel) develops a negative charge. Updrafts within a storm cloud separate the lighter ice crystals from the heavier graupel, causing the top region of the cloud to accumulate a positive space charge while the lower level accumulates a negative space charge.|$|E
500|$|At [...] CDT on 20 April 2010, {{during the}} final phases of {{drilling}} the exploratory well at Macondo, a geyser of seawater erupted from the marine riser onto the rig, shooting [...] into the air. [...] This was soon followed by the eruption of a <b>slushy</b> combination of drilling mud, methane gas, and water. The gas component of the <b>slushy</b> material quickly transitioned into a fully gaseous state and then ignited {{into a series of}} explosions and then a firestorm. An attempt was made to activate the blowout preventer, but it failed. The final defense to prevent an oil spill, a device known as a blind shear ram, was activated but failed to plug the well.|$|E

50|$|Bubble tea cafés will {{frequently}} serve drinks without {{coffee or}} tea in them. The base for these drinks is flavoring blended with ice, often called snow bubble. All mix-ins {{that can be}} added to the bubble tea {{can be added to}} these slushie-like drinks. One drawback is that the coldness of the iced drink may cause the tapioca balls to harden, making them difficult to suck up through a straw and chew. To prevent this from happening, these <b>slushies</b> must be consumed more quickly than bubble tea.|$|R
500|$|... "2 Become 1" [...] was co-written by the Spice Girls {{along with}} {{partners}} Richard Stannard and Matthew Rowe. Stannard and Rowe also co-produced the track. After writing more uptempo dance-based songs, such as [...] "Wannabe", {{the group and}} the two producers decided to write a slow ballad.

500|$|The {{conditions}} underfoot were <b>slushy</b> {{during the}} day, {{as the temperature}} warmed up. Shackleton resolved to {{do most of the}} trekking at night, sledging the three lifeboats of the Endurance behind them. The sledging was hard work and after little more than a week, Shackleton and his men were forced to camp once more. [...] Underneath, the ice continued to move northwards, and by April 1916, the floe they were on was nearly within sight of Elephant Island but beginning to break up. Shackleton ordered the expedition to the lifeboats, placing Worsley in charge of one of them, the Dudley Docker. [...] It took a week to reach Elephant Island, the ice and currents inhibiting progress.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} to the South-east Alaskan ports were the All-Canadian routes, so-called because they mostly stayed on Canadian soil throughout their journey. These were popular with British and Canadians for patriotic reasons and because they avoided American customs. The first of these, around [...] in length, started from Ashcroft in British Columbia and crossed swamps, river gorges, and mountains until it met with the Stikine River route at Glenora. From Glenora, prospectors would face the same difficulties as those who came from Wrangell. At least 1,500 men attempted to travel along the Ashcroft route and 5,000 along the Stikine. The mud and the <b>slushy</b> ice of the two routes proved exhausting, killing or incapacitating the pack animals and creating chaos amongst the travellers.|$|E

Mario Tarradell of the Dallas Morning News remarked [...] "No Me Ames" [...] as an [...] "island flavored" [...] song. Lauri Mascia of the Sun-Sentinel expressed disappointment over the song and felt that the tropical version did not fit the album.

500|$|Matthew Rettenmund, {{author of}} Encyclopedia Madonnica complimented the vocals on the song, calling them [...] "elegantly layered... and an inventive, {{overlapping}} vocal rap {{that makes it}} a standout production".

Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna complimented the radio friendly sound of the song, but felt that the lyrics [...] "had been used in countless songs", rendering them incoherent. Chris Willman from Los Angeles Times criticized the song's lyrics, saying: [...] "Despite having crafted some of the best singles of the '80s, and despite being a genuine wit, Madonna can tend toward terribly banal rhymes."

And rousing Regionals-winning anthem 'Loser Like Me' landed like an exuberant <b>slushy</b> in the face [...]" [...] Katie Morgan of Billboard praised the performance of [...] "Candles", and called it [...] "beautifully intimate", and commended The Warblers' [...] "solid performance". Todd VanDerrWerf of The A.V. Club responded negatively to [...] "Trouty Mouth", but was generally pleased with the other songs. VanDerWerff went on to praise the voice of Lea Michele: [...] "The first song Rachel sang at regionals [...] was a nicely done little ballad, the sort of song you could both see someone like Rachel writing and later belting." [...] James Poniewozik also praised the voice of Michele, as well as her character development. He opined, [...] "That said, I like the arc of Rachel-as-songwriter, which has played to some of Lea Michele's greatest strengths both as a comic and dramatic actress." [...] Robert Canning of IGN found the original songs to be [...] "hilarious". He opined, [...] "Getting to run through a series of comical and catchy false starts was entertaining. Santana's 'Trouty Mouth' was sultry and hilarious. Puckerman's rocking ode to Lauren, 'Big Ass Heart,' was also a ridiculous treat. And then both were outdone by Mercedes' stomping, Amy Winehouse-aping 'Hell to the No'." ...|$|E

Stadiums for sports and rock concerts sell beer and other mild alcoholic beverages, usually in plastic disposable cups since glass bottles could be used as projectiles by unruly spectators.
