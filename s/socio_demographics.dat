40|$|Abstract: Associations between {{contaminated}} land and <b>socio</b> <b>demographics</b> are well documented in high-income countries. In low- and middle-income countries, however, {{little is known}} about the extent of {{contaminated land}} and possible demographic correlations. This is an important yet sparsely researched topic with potentially significant public health implications as exposure to pollution remains a leading source of morbidity and mortality in low-income countries. In this study, we review the associations between several socio demographic factors (population, population density, unemployment, education, and literacy) and contaminated sites in Ghana. Within this context, both correlation and association intend to show the relationship between two variables, namely contaminated sites and <b>socio</b> <b>demographics.</b> Aggregated district level 2010 census data from Ghana Statistical Service and contaminated site location data from Pure Earth’s Toxic Sites Identification Program (TSIP) were spatially evaluated using the number of sites per kilometer squared within districts as the unit of measurement. We found a low to medium positive correlation (ρ range: 0. 285 to 0. 478) between contaminated sites and th...|$|E

Our study builds on representative household survey data, providing information on various <b>socio</b> <b>demographics,</b> household electricity consumption and ownership of solar facilities. The redistributive effects of the feed-in tariff are evaluated by means of various inequality indices. All the inequality measures indicate that Germany's feed-in tariff is mildly regressive.

This study {{was aimed at}} identifying the sociodemographic profile and presenting symptoms of the disease amongst patients attending the virology clinic at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH), Kano, and to assess the relationship with known confounding factors. A total of 430 HIV infected patients attending the virology clinic at AKTH were recruited into the study. Medical records as obtained from the center were reviewed and pretested, structured and mainly closed ended questionnaires were administered on the patients to extract data on <b>socio</b> <b>demographics,</b> symptoms and attitude to retroviral tests. Data on 400 out of 430 patients were analysed {{with a mean age}} of 33. 6 years. 67. 2 % of them were females and 29. 5 % had no formal education with 10. 5 % having postgraduate education.

Fever was the main presenting symptom in 28. 3 % of them, while cough brought 16. 3 % of them to the clinic, and premature labour occurred in less than 1 % of them. Sexual habit was associated with economic status, level of education and marital status of the population.

40|$|This is a {{cross-sectional}} study on school bullying involving 410 standard six students from seven national primary {{schools in the}} Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur. Information on bullying, victimization and bully-victim were gathered using a Malaysian selfrating bullying questionnaire. <b>Socio</b> <b>demographic</b> characteristics {{of the respondents were}} also obtained. 41. 2 % of these children reported having been victims of bullies whilst another 17. 6 % who had been bullied turned aggressor (bully-victims). Only 2. 4 % admitted to being the bully. Significant <b>socio</b> <b>demographic</b> characteristics include sex, ethnicity and academic performance were assessed. In the multivariate analysis, the bullies (OR= 9. 19, CI= 1. 74 - 8. 45) and the bully-victims (OR= 11. 43, CI= 1. 7 - 73. 08) were significantly associated with being male. Similarly, having at least six siblings were significantly associated with bullies (OR= 14. 33, CI= 1. 66 - 123. 66), and bully-victims (OR= 16. 88, CI= 1. 67 - 170. 60). Victims were significantly associated with Indian ethnicity (OR= 6. 23, CI= 1. 14 - 34. 07) and having older fathers (OR= 0. 87, CI= 0. 78 - 0. 96). This study suggests that school bullying is common even in the primary schools.

40|$|Background: The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} tri-dimensional (3 D) movies has raised public concern and media interest {{about the safety}} of projected images for spectators. No specific instrument exists to assess the occurrence of visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) symptoms in 3 D movie spectators in movie theaters. Methods: We developed a questionnaire containing 20 items divided into <b>socio</b> <b>demographics,</b> individual characteristics, movie vision characteristics and VIMS symptoms (during, right after, and at two hours from the viewing of the movie). The questionnaire was self administered to 38 subjects, asking them to report time taken for its completion, comments and eventual difficulties in interpreting items. Results: Poor understanding or problems in identifying the correct item choice were noted for 4 questions belonging to the <b>socio</b> <b>demographics</b> section that were simplified in {{the final version of the}} questionnaire. Two other questions were merged into one after homogeneity analysis. Most VIMS symptoms were observed during the movie and quickly thereafter. Tired eyes was the symptom most often reported (39. 5 % of responders) followed by headache (18. 4 %), dizziness (18. 4 %) and nausea (15. 8 %). Double vision and palpitation were reported with very low frequency (respectively 5. 3 % and 2. 3 %) and vomit was not reported by any respondent. Homogeneity of symptom items was good (Cronbach alpha= 0. 69). Reliability analysis showed satisfactory item-total correlations (alpha coefficient ranging from 0. 61 to 0. 73). Conclusions: The refined survey questionnaire can be applied in future studies to assess the frequency of VIMS symptoms in spectators of 3 D movies and to identify the risk factors connected to inter-individual differences in susceptibility and to the characteristics of the movie viewing...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the associations between socio-demographic factors, nutritional knowledge, weight management knowledge, lifestyle factors, dietary intake and anthropometric factors with body weight status (BMI) among Iranian postgraduate students in UPM.

In order to increase carpooling, {{it is important to}} understand why people do or not carpool. This study, carried out a large sample of drivers, was aimed at (1) identifying whether or not people carpool, (2) investigating the factual data (e. g. <b>socio</b> <b>demographics,</b> transportation accessibility) and motivational factors (e. g. attitudes regarding car use, public transportation, environment) upon which carpoolers and noncarpoolers differ, and (3) highlighting the main determinants of the practice of carpooling.

In our sample, 52. 5 % of the participants said they were using carpooling. Carpoolers and non-carpoolers were similar in terms of kilometers driven per year, distance to their workplace or schools/universities, and public transportation accessibility. Compared to non-carpoolers, carpoolers were more likely to be women, have children, have positive attitudes toward public transport, and be more environmentally aware.

Method: A total of 145 of 200 married women of reproductive age who were pregnant or had experienced birth responded to the questionnaire about their ANC visits.
