Approximately 16 <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> replicates were collected and sorted for every one drop or benthic sled sample. The drop sampler collected {{the greatest number of}} species and provided the highest density estimates for the majority of crustaceans and small demersal fishes; the sled provided comparable density estimates for penaeids and small demersal nekton, while under-representing more mobile fishes. Densities of small benthic nekton were underestimated by the <b>cast</b> <b>net,</b> but it provided the highest density estimates for larger and mobile fishes. Within the selectivity constraints of each gear, the sled and <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> provide viable alternatives to the drop sampler for sampling particular nekton from shallow open water habitats...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{establish}} trends in the <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> fishery of Kainji Lake, Nigeria. The <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> fishery was second in importance to the gillnet fishery {{in the early years}} after impoundment of the lake and still continues to be {{an important component of the}} fishery. Some of the economically important species such as Citharinus spp, Tilapia spp, Labeo spp, Alestes spp and Synodontis spp are exploited by <b>cast</b> <b>nets.</b> The study has not revealed any drastic perturbation in the species diversity, catch composition, and any real ecosystem overfishing. On the other hand, both the catfish, Auchenoglanis spp and the predator Hydrocynus spp appear to have increased in the catch in recent years. Never-the-less there is a decline in the mean weight of the major exploited fish species due to the capture of under sized fishes without allowing them to grow to 'legally' marketable sizes. The use of small meshed <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> and also fishing in the shallow waters of the lake can give rise to this situation. Thus, there are signs of growth overfishing in the fish stocks. It must also be acknowledged that the situation is complicated by the fact that in a multi-gear fishery as on Kainji Lake, the <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> fishery could not be managed in isolation without due regard to the other competing gears. The catch per unit of effort (CPUE) has declined in the <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> fishery possibly due to the increase in effort by the major fishing gears over the years. The ongoing extension campaigns by the KLFPP appears to be having the desired effect, as there was reduction in the number of the major fishing gears on the Lake in 1997. It can be anticipated that if this trend continues, the CPUE will recover in the long run. Yields observed from the mesh selectivity study revealed that for major species in the <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> fishery, both by number and weight, were maximal at 2. 5 inch mesh, which contrasts with the fact that current minimum allowable mesh in the Fisheries Edict for the Lake is 2. 0 inch. The adoption of 2. 5 inch as the minimum allowable mesh in the <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> fishery is recommended to be included in future revision of existing regulations. It is also recommended that for this control to have a desired effect, the <b>casting</b> of the <b>net</b> from the shore should be prohibited so as to reduce the incidence of juvenile mortality in the nursery areas.

40|$|Red drum is one ofthe {{most popular}} species sought by anglers in Florida Bay, yet juveniles are rarely encountered. We {{evaluated}} Florida Bay as a nursery area for red drum by sampling for recently-settled late larvae in basin areas within the bay with an epi-benthic sled at six stations in November 2000, and at seven stations during December 2000 through February 2001. In November 2000 we surveyed potential sampling sites in quiet backwaters adjacent to mangroves for juvenile red drum. A total of 202 sites were sampled mainly in northern Florida Bay and adjacent waters with a <b>cast</b> <b>net.</b> We collected only one recently-settled red drum larvae and no juveniles. Obviously the sites that we sampled in Florida Bay and adjacent waters are not nursery habitat for this valuable species. Sled collections {{were dominated by}} bay anchovy, Anchoa mitchilli, but densities were biased by one collection. Five small resident species were among the dominant species: rainwater killifish, Lucania parva; dusky pipefish, Syngnathus floridae; dwarf seahorse, Hippocampus zosterae; and clown goby, Microgobius gulosus. Three species that spawn outside Florida Bay in the GulfofMexico were common: pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides; pigfish, Orthopristis chrysoptera; and silver perch, Bairdiella chrysoura. Twenty-seven species were collected with the <b>cast</b> <b>net.</b> Hardhead silversides (Atherinomorus stipes), bay anchovy, tidewater mojarra (Eucinostomus harengulus), silver jenny (Eucinostomus gula), and goldspotted killifish (Floridichthys carpio) were the most common in <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> collections. Although only one red drum was collected, we were able to: (1) identify mesohaline waters from our <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> sites to test our preliminary assessment that mesohaline habitat might be limited in Florida Bay, (2) document the distribution and abundance of fishes collected by <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> that should enhance our understanding of ichthyofauna in the Northern Subdivision ofFlorida Bay and adjacent waters, and (3) from epibenthic sled collections, describe the habitats, abundance and distribution of recently settled larvae/small juveniles/small resident fishes during late fall and winter. This information should be useful to managers and future research. (PDF contains 34 pages...|$|R

40|$|Most {{studies of}} seabirds that involve {{trapping}} and marking birds {{are carried out}} at breeding colonies. This bias toward the breeding period and colony-based research is partially caused by difficulties in capturing birds at sea. From 2005 to 2007, we used a <b>cast</b> <b>net</b> thrown by hand from a fishing boat to capture albatrosses and petrels at sea in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. About 500 birds of 13 species were captured, {{ranging in size from}} the 30 -g Wilson's Storm-petrel (Oceanites oceanicus) to the 10 -kg Wandering Albatross (Diomedea exulans). <b>Cast</b> <b>nets</b> are potentially useful for capturing any seabird that can be attracted close to fishing vessels by bait, such as sardines, squid, offal, or shark liver, thrown into the water. Our method was most effective for capturing bold species, such as Cape (Daption capense), Spectacled (Procellaria conspicillata), and White-chinned (Procellaria aequinoctialis) petrels and Great Shearwaters (Puffinus gravis), but was not effective for capturing shy species, such as Cory's (Calonectris diomedea), Cape Verde (Calonectris edwardsii) and Manx (Puffinus puffinus) shearwaters, species that rarely sit on the water, such as Wilson's Storm-petrels, Thin-billed (Pachyptila belcheri) and Antarctic (Pachyptila desolata) prions and Atlantic Petrels (Pterodroma incerta), and species with excellent diving abilities, such as Sooty Shearwaters (Puffinus griseus).
