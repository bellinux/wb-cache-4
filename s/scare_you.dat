5|$|Crawford's {{appearance}} in the 1969 television film Night Gallery (which served as pilot to the series that followed), marked one of Steven Spielberg's earliest directing jobs. She made a cameo appearance as herself in the first episode of the situation comedy The Tim Conway Show, which aired on January 30, 1970. She starred {{on the big screen}} one final time, playing Dr. Brockton in Herman Cohen's science fiction horror film Trog (1970), rounding out a career spanning 45 years and more than eighty motion pictures. Crawford made three more television appearances, as Stephanie White in a 1970 episode ("The Nightmare") of The Virginian and as Joan Fairchild (her final performance) in a 1972 episode ("Dear Joan: We're Going to <b>Scare</b> <b>You</b> to Death") of The Sixth Sense.|$|E
500|$|The album also {{contains}} a hidden track at the end called [...] "Bite Me." [...] The [...] "song", which consists of several seconds of loud music and Yankovic screaming, appears after 10 minutes of silence following [...] "You Don't Love Me Anymore". According to Yankovic, the song was supposed to [...] "come on [...] and <b>scare</b> <b>you</b> to death." [...] Later pressings of Off the Deep End by Volcano and pressings outside the USA took away the hidden track and silence. The track is a nod to Nirvana; certain pressings of Nevermind featured a hidden track entitled [...] "Endless, Nameless".|$|E
500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Dig My Grave" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} by Parry Gettelman of the Orlando Sentinel as [...] "an angry, fuzzed-out rocker". The vocals for the track were recorded through a guitar fuzz-box in order to distort them. [...] "I Palindrome I", is the final single that was released to promote Apollo 18. [...] The circular nature of the song's lyrical themes is reinforced by its title and use of palindromes. In fact, the song is notable for featuring a word-by-word palindrome in one of the verses: [...] "'Son, I am able', she said, 'though you scare me.' 'Watch', said I. 'Beloved", I said, 'watch me <b>scare</b> <b>you,</b> though.' Said she, 'Able am I, son.'" [...] "She's Actual Size" [...] was written by Flansburgh after he contemplated the imagery of someone viewing a departing person in a mirror; he felt that the symbolism was a [...] "really succinct way of talking about leaving somebody behind". The band later expressed disappointment with the [...] "definitive" [...] version featured on this album, largely because the song continued to develop as the band played it live. Flansburgh called the album version [...] "timid" [...] and noted that [...] "later performance versions of [...] have so much more spirit than the recorded version." [...] Although Linnell and Flansburgh usually write songs individually, [...] "My Evil Twin" [...] was an example of the two collaborating. Linnell wrote the musical structure of the song, rendering it as a MIDI file, and Flansburgh then wrote the melody and the lyrics. [...] "Mammal" [...] discusses various members of the titular vertebrate class, and, according to Linnell, poetically explores the fact that all mammals have hair {{at some point in their}} lifespan. According to Linnell, most of the scientific information in the song was gathered from an encyclopedia.|$|E

500|$|In his 1980 commentary, Philip K. Dick {{pointed out}} the moral {{ambiguity}} of the story, laying out its political implications: [...] "Should we have a leader or should we think for ourselves? Obviously the latter, in principle. But – sometimes there lies a gulf between what is theoretically right and that which is practical." [...] This quote became {{part of a larger}} political analysis of Dick's work in How Much Does Chaos <b>Scare</b> <b>You?</b> by Aaron Barlow, Associate Professor of English at New York City College of Technology. In analyzing Dick's short fiction, Barlow presented their themes against the backdrop of post-September 11, 2001 America. In particular, Barlow compared many of the philosophical underpinnings of Neoconservatism, and its rise to prominence during the George W. Bush administration, to the philosophy of Philip K. Dick. [...] "To ," [...] writes Barlow, [...] "the elites were both alien and dangerous. To him, the focus of vision and of political debate should never be on the rulers, but on the little person, the shopkeeper, the mechanic." [...] In his dissection of Dick's work, Barlow compared several stories in which normal humans lose some form of liberty in their society to an elite group. Examples presented include [...] "Autofac", [...] "Null-O", and [...] "Some Kinds of Life". From these stories, Barlow drew three themes important to Dick's anti-government writings: first, that humanity is often doomed by institutions of power created by the humans themselves; second, that paranoia is a natural aspect of governance, as [...] "o elite can ever completely trust the people it governs," [...] and this distrust leaves a governed people in perpetual danger; and third, that the belief that individuality must be sacrificed—either for the sake of social stability or survival—is a constant threat. [...] "To Dick," [...] Barlow adds, [...] "there are few attitudes more dangerous than this." [...] Each of these themes would be revisited in [...] "The Last of the Masters".|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{scored the}} game 7.6 out of 10, writing [...] "it {{might be a}} little too {{straightforward}} in spots, but it does make for a solid action game." [...] He concluded that [...] "although The Suffering tends to rely more on startling you with visual effects and sudden attacks than on actually trying to <b>scare</b> <b>you,</b> it's still a pretty refreshing take on horror-themed games. [...] more monsters, more ways to do them in, and perhaps some slightly more-involving puzzles would have probably made the game feel more in-depth. But even taking this into consideration, The Suffering is a fun action game." ...|$|E
2500|$|The role {{reversal}} between Travolta and Cage was {{a subject of}} praise, as were the stylized, violent action sequences. Critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film {{three out of four}} and remarked that, [...] "Here, using big movie stars and asking them to play each other, Woo and his writers find a terrific counterpoint to the action scenes: All through the movie, you find yourself reinterpreting every scene as you realize the [...] "other" [...] character is [...] "really" [...] playing it." [...] Rolling Stones Peter Travers said of the film, [...] "You may not buy the premise or the windup, but with Travolta and Cage taking comic and psychic measures of their characters and their own careers, there is no resisting Face/Off. This you gotta see." [...] Richard Corliss of Time said that the film [...] "isn't just a thrill ride, it's a rocket into the thrilling past, when directors could <b>scare</b> <b>you</b> with how much emotion they packed into a movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|Andrew Rice of The New York Times commented: [...] "Kunle Afolayan {{wants to}} <b>scare</b> <b>you,</b> {{he wants to}} thrill you, {{he wants to make}} you laugh, but most of all, he would like you to suspend your disbelief — in his plots, yes, which tend to be over the top, but also about what is {{possible}} in Africa." [...] Shari Bollers of Afridiziak stated [...] "All the characters were created to enable the audience to warm up to them and to laugh with and at them. With its switching of dual languages of native and English, it was easy to follow. It was a film that included everyone and warmed us with the humour. Whether Nigerian or not you will find this film funny." [...] Caitlin Pearson of The Africa Channel stated: [...] "What makes the plot of Phone Swap engaging are the performances from its all-star cast, and a visual range in its cinematography that allows us to see more of Nigeria than any claustrophobic Nollywood film could ever hope to do. [...] Francis McKay of Flick Hunter gave a 3 out of 4 stars and concluded: [...] "Kunle Afolayan crafted a highly watchable film with a good story and a cast led by two talented actors. The film is a good representation of Nigeria...".|$|E
