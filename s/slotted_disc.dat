50|$|Stampfer {{read about}} Faraday's {{findings}} in December 1832 and {{was inspired to}} do similar experiments, which soon led to his invention {{of what he called}} Stroboscopischen Scheiben oder optischen Zauberscheiben (stroboscope discs or optical magic discs). Stampfer had thought of placing the sequence of images on either a disc, a cylinder (like the later zoetrope) or, for a greater number of images, on a long, looped strip of paper or canvas stretched around two parallel rollers (much like film reels). He also suggests covering up most of the disc or the mirror with a cut-out sheet of cardboard so that one sees only one of the moving figures, and painting theatrical coulisses and backdrops around the cut-out part (somewhat similar to the later Praxinoscope-Theatre). Stampfer also mentioned a version which has a disc with pictures on one end and a <b>slotted</b> <b>disc</b> {{on the other side of}} an axis, but he found spinning the disc in front of a mirror more simple. By February 1833 he had prepared six double-sided discs, which were later published by Trentsensky & Vieweg. Matthias Trentsensky and Stampfer were granted an Austrian patent (Kaiserlichen königlichen Privilegium) for the discs on 7 May 1833.|$|E
40|$|A load–displacement {{prediction}} for a bended <b>slotted</b> <b>disc</b> {{using the}} energy method Noor Fawazi 1, 2, Jung-Youn Lee 3 and Jae-Eung Oh 4 A <b>slotted</b> <b>disc</b> spring {{consists of two}} segments: a coned disc segment {{and a number of}} lever arm segments. In this study, a load–displacement formula for the <b>slotted</b> <b>disc</b> spring is newly developed in the form of energy method by considering both rigid and bending deflections of the two segments. This formula is developed with the aim to further improve the SAE formula which is limited to a straight <b>slotted</b> <b>disc</b> spring. The coned and the lever arm angles of the straight <b>slotted</b> <b>disc</b> spring are the same. They are different for a bended <b>slotted</b> <b>disc</b> spring. Because of this limitation, it is geometrically impractical to employ the SAE formula for a bended <b>slotted</b> <b>disc</b> spring. To achieve the goal of this study, new calculations based on geometric and material properties inputs are developed for a bended <b>slotted</b> <b>disc</b> spring. A firm background study based on the theory of Almen is presented in developing new load–displacement calculations for a bended <b>slotted</b> <b>disc</b> spring...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{calculation of}} the load-displacement prediction for a <b>slotted</b> <b>disc</b> spring is proposed. There {{are two types of}} <b>slotted</b> <b>disc</b> spring; a straight <b>slotted</b> <b>disc</b> spring and a bended <b>slotted</b> <b>disc</b> spring. By considering these two types of <b>slotted</b> <b>disc</b> spring, this work attempts to extend the previous work on load-displacement prediction for the <b>slotted</b> <b>disc</b> spring using the energy method. To show the validity of the improved method, the load-displacement results using the improved computation, the previous proposed method, and the finite element analyses are compared. In this work, the improved computation and the finite element analyses have accounted for the radial deflection of the disc spring which is different in the previous work. The radial deflection of the disc spring was ignored in the previous work and the comparison to the finite element analyses without accounting the radial deflection is not practical. The present work is compared to the finite element analyses which make the comparison to be more reasonable and more practical...|$|E

50|$|During the {{production}} of the Model AA, the wheels were also changed. Spoked wheels similar in appearance to Model A wheels but much heavier were used during 1928-1929. Twenty inch 6 <b>slot</b> <b>disc</b> wheels were produced by Budd for Ford. In 1930, a new style 20 inch 5 <b>slot</b> <b>disc</b> wheel was adopted. These wheels were used for 1930 and part of 1931. The final wheels were a further modification of the 1930 wheel, with a raised center to reinforce the wheels and allow spacing of dual wheels in the rear so the tires would not rub against each other. The dual wheels were used for a variety of body styles, including dump trucks, tow trucks, tankers, fire trucks, and flatbed stake trucks. Wheel nuts changed with each new style of wheel to meet the changes made in the designs of the wheel. Special wheels were produced for ambulances, buses, and funeral coaches (hearses).|$|R

50|$|An {{incorrect}} explanation sometimes {{given for}} brake fade is heated brake shoes evaporate to generate gas that separate {{them from the}} drum. Such effects are easy to imagine, but physically impossible, due to the large volume of gas {{that would be required}} for such an effect. A gas bearing would need gas replenishment as fast as the disc or drum moves, since it has no gas on its surface as it approaches the pad or shoe. Also, disc brakes use much the same materials and operate well with little fade, even when the discs are glowing hot. If brake materials outgassed at drum temperatures, they would also outgas at disc temperatures and would fade substantially. Since discs have little fade, they also demonstrate outgassing is not a source of fade. Some disc brakes are drilled or <b>slotted,</b> but smooth <b>discs</b> show no more fade.|$|R

40|$|Aluminium based {{metal matrix}} {{composites}} {{are widely used}} in automobile components such as cardan shaft of Chevrolet corvette, disc brake and engine push rod. In this experiment a Hybrid Metal Matrix Composites (HMMC) are fabricated and drilled. Drilling {{is the process of}} making <b>slots</b> in <b>disc</b> brake and thread in the engine parts. The surface quality of the drilled specimen depends on the speed, feed, drill type and the thrust force. Thrust force plays the major role in drilling the specimen. In this experiment HMMCs are fabricated using two processes-called, sonication and casting. Sonication is the process of coating the carbon nanotubes over the silicon carbide particles (SiCp). Semisolid stir casting is used to reinforce the coated SiCp in the LM 25 alloy. A drilling process is performed on HMMC to analyse {{the extent to which the}} input parameters influence the thrust force and Ovality. The tools used for drilling are solid carbide tools of three different diameters. Taguchi’s experimental design is adopted for the drilling operation. A mathematical model is used to determine the influence of input parameters on the outputs thrust force and ovality. This paper proves the combination of N 3, f 1 and d 1 of the carbide tool results in the lowest value of thrust force and ovality while drilling HMMCs. In this work the HMMC is prepared by coating the abrasive nature, silicon carbide particle and there is a good interfacial bonding between the reinforced particle and matrix and the drilling process becomes smoother. The new being of this article is the treated ceramics, SiCp with carbon nanotubes. This HMMC shows the improved mechanical properties compared to other metal matrix composites surveyed in the literatures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBroaching is the {{standard}} machining process for fir-tree <b>slots</b> in turbine <b>discs.</b> Due {{to the fact that}} Inconel 718 turbine discs belong to the safety critical components of aero engines, there are high demands on dimensional accuracy and surface quality. The cutting parameters as well as tool, fixture and machine tool are critical factors to fulfill these high requirements. Within the next years the process has to be designed for the needs of new turbine disc geometries, disc materials and tool materials. Therefore, detailed knowledge about process forces is an essential prerequisite. Modern 2 D FEM simulations enable calculations of the thermo- mechanical load collective in the chip-tool interface. A 2 D chip formation model of the broaching process has been designed to calculate cutting forces for process relevant parameters, as the rake angle, rise per tooth and cutting speed. Depending on these parameters a multivariate regression model has been de- veloped. The chip formation and the multivariate regression model have been validated on a test bench for fundamental cutting investigations, simultaneous process forces were measured and high speed films were recorded. This paper thoroughly discusses the results and evaluates the application potential...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} sources of stress arising in {{turbomachinery}} blades are the centrifugal loads acting at any section of the airfoil.
