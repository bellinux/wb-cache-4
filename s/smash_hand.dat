5000|$|Six balls {{into the}} morning session, Abdul Razzaq was lbw to Corey Collymore, and the West Indians in the crowd hoped for a quick finish. Far from it, as Kamran Akmal and Naved-ul-Hasan added 19 before Naved-ul-Hasan was forced to retire with a <b>smashed</b> <b>hand.</b> That gave the West Indies some hope, as they wrapped up the innings ten overs {{into the morning}} session, but those 38 runs conceded could have proven costly. The West Indian reply was {{anything}} but cautious, as Chris Gayle started the innings with smashing three fours off the injured Naved-ul-Hasan, who bowled six overs for fifty runs on the day - he was taken off after two overs for 22 with the new ball, then bowled another spell of four overs for 28. They raced to 48 for 0 before Gayle was tricked by an away-swinger from Abdul Razzaq, giving an outside edge to Kamran Akmal. Devon Smith and Ramnaresh Sarwan slowed down, scoring only 11 before Devon Smith was out to a grubber from Abdul Razzaq, so the innings was finely poised at 59 for 2.

His durability was sufficient to withstand the combined attacks of all the Avengers, and he demonstrated remarkable healing abilities, recovering in seconds after Daisy Johnson used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does.|$|R
