5|$|After {{losing his}} reelection bid in 1861, Stevenson, a known Confederate sympathizer, <b>stayed</b> <b>out</b> {{of public life}} {{during the war and}} was {{consequently}} able to avoid being imprisoned, as many other Confederate sympathizers were.

Although a fiscal conservative, he advocated a new tax to benefit education and created the state bureau of education.|$|E

5|$|From July to August 1764, Johnson {{negotiated}} a treaty at Fort Niagara with about 2,000 Native Americans in attendance, primarily Iroquois. Although most Iroquois had <b>stayed</b> <b>out</b> of the war, Senecas from the Genesee River valley {{had taken up}} arms against the British, and Johnson worked {{to bring them back}} into the Covenant Chain alliance. As restitution for the Devil's Hole ambush, the Senecas were compelled to cede the strategically important Niagara portage to the British. Johnson even convinced the Iroquois to send a war party against the Ohio Native Americans. This Iroquois expedition captured a number of Delawares and destroyed abandoned Delaware and Shawnee towns in the Susquehanna Valley, but otherwise the Iroquois did not contribute to the war effort as much as Johnson had desired.|$|E

5|$|At {{the first}} round of pit stops, Hamilton had a lead of nearly 20seconds over Massa, and fuelled longer than all the other drivers in the points-scoring {{positions}} when he pitted on lap18.

The two drivers then nearly collided at the hairpin, with Hamilton holding back {{for the rest of the}} lap waiting for Trulli to pit.
