5000|$|Annie {{was born}} in Springhead, Saddleworth, in the West Riding of Yorkshire (part of the Borough of Oldham), on 13 September 1879, the 4th {{daughter}} (of 12 children) of Nelson Horatio Kenney (1849-1912) and Anne Wood (1852-1905); the family was poor and working class, and Kenney started part-time work in a local cotton mill {{at the age of}} 10, as well as attending school; turning full-time at 13 - which involved 12-hour shifts from 6 in the morning to 6 in the evening. She was employed as a [...] "tenter", a weaver's assistant, part of her job being to fit the bobbins and to attend to the strands of fleece when they broke; during one such operation, one of her fingers was ripped off by a <b>spinning</b> <b>bobbin.</b> She remained at the mill for 15 years, becoming involved in trade-union activities, furthering her education through self-study, and promoting the study of literature amongst her work colleagues - inspired by Robert Blatchford's publication, The Clarion; she was also a regular church attender [...]|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Mary Ann founded Nantucket Looms {{and then the}} Nantucket School of Needlery, the only {{licensed}} needle arts school in the US. The mission of the School was to train local young women in the needle arts, creating a form of employment which offered to them careers on the island as instructors in the resident School and teachers for the School's Nantucket School of Needlery Home Study Course, which Mary Ann wrote and illustrated in review with them. Support from the Nantucket Historic Trust provided pay and housing for professionals in the textile arts {{from all over the}} world to teach needlery at the resident classes. Workshops were offered year round in subjects such as tapestry, weaving, vegetal dye, <b>spinning,</b> <b>bobbin</b> lace, and silk screen printing. Mary Ann began her book collection as a personal research tool and source for her home study courses. The collection was acquired through working with rare book dealers who specialized in her textile and decorative art interests, and was housed and curated in a library at the School. When the School closed in the late 1970s, Mary Ann had moved to Williamstown; the collection was too large to house at home. In the interests of her continued research and the significance of maintaining the entire collection in a single library available to scholars, the Clark Library was selected as the recipient of the collection.|$|E
5000|$|Yarn {{clearing}} {{is usually}} {{part of the}} yarn winding step. The yarn {{from a number of}} <b>spinning</b> <b>bobbins,</b> called 'cops', is wound on to larger packages called 'cones' for subsequent processing into fabric. During the winding the yarn was traditionally passed through the narrow slit in a steel plate of a yarn clearer or slub-catcher. The object was to catch thick places, or slubs, which occurred when the spinning process suffered an aberration, and to prevent them being woven into the fabric to present unsightly faults.|$|R
60|$|All the time, like motion without thought, {{her fingers}} teased out the fleece, drawing {{it down to}} a fairly uniform thickness: brown, old, natural fingers that worked as in a sleep, the thumb having a long grey nail; and from moment to moment there was a quick, {{downward}} rub, between thumb and forefinger, of the thread that hung in front of her apron, the heavy <b>bobbin</b> <b>spun</b> more briskly, and she felt again at the fleece as she drew it down, and she gave a twist to the thread that issued, and the <b>bobbin</b> <b>spun</b> swiftly.|$|R
50|$|An example gear {{application}} {{would be}} a device that winds thread onto a conical <b>bobbin</b> on a <b>spinning</b> machine. The <b>bobbin</b> would need to wind faster when the thread is near the apex than when it is near the base.|$|R
60|$|Her thread broke. She {{seemed to}} take no notice, but {{mechanically}} picked up the shuttle, wound up a length of worsted, connected the ends from her wool strand, set the <b>bobbin</b> <b>spinning</b> again, and went on talking, in her half-intimate, half-unconscious fashion, {{as if she were}} talking to her own world in me.|$|R
50|$|The {{idea was}} taken up by John Lombe who, with his brother Thomas, engaged Sorocold to build a new, larger mill, based on the Italian pattern, {{on the site of}} the old one, {{completed}} in 1722. For Sorocold, who had previously been engaged with pumps and water wheels, this was something of a challenge. The machinery when finished contained 10,000 spindles, with 25,000 <b>spinning</b> reel <b>bobbins,</b> nearly 5000 star wheels, over 9000 twist bobbins and 46,000 winding bobbins, all to be driven by a single water wheel. Lombe's Mill, extensively reconstructed after a fire in 1910, is now the Derby Industrial Museum.|$|R
50|$|Ralph's {{father died}} when James three years old, who as the eldest of three sons was set {{to work at the}} age of six-and-a-half as a doffer in a cotton mill. He worked half-time until the age of eleven, when he began {{full-time}} work,(The doffer's job {{was at the end of}} the <b>spinning</b> process, replacing <b>bobbins</b> which had filled with thread with empty ones).|$|R
40|$|Yarn {{diameter}} is {{an important}} property which affects the physical properties of the end products. Variations in yarn diameter cause undesirable effects such as imperfections in the knitted or woven fabric and difficulties in weaving prep-aration stages. Thin places in the yarn cause low breaking strength creating difficulties in the downstream processes such as warping, sizing and weaving. Thick places and neps cause appearance imperfections in the fabric. As is known in winding, yarns on <b>spinning</b> <b>bobbins</b> are assembled into larger yarn packages with different tech-niques of splicing. In splicing, {{it is very important}} to obtain a splice with a diameter that is close to the diameter of the parent yarn for the reasons mentioned above. Many studies have been carried out in order to investigate the effects of splicing parameters on the diameter of the splices in yarns. Cheng and Lam investigated different properties of spliced ring spun yarns such as abrasion, bending rigidity and appearance [1, 2]. 1 They used an overall score to evaluate the data obtained from experiments and found that yarn linear density and the degree of overlapping of yarn ends mostly affect the overall spliced yarn properties [1, 2]. Das et al. studied the parameters of fiber friction, yarn twist and splicing air pressure. They observed that the diameter of the splices in yarn is influenced by yarn twist and splicing air pressure [3]. Drobina and Machnio applied image analysis for the identification of the geometric sizes of spliced zones [4]. Hassen et al. found that increasing the time of water injection and yarn overlapping length improved the appear-ance of splices in yarns in water injection splicing [5]. Lewandowski and Drobina investigated the geometric sizes of combed wool yarns spliced under different condition...|$|R
25|$|During the American Revolutionary War, {{she went}} to work to help support the family by sewing, knitting, <b>spinning,</b> and weaving <b>bobbin</b> lace. From the lacemaking she derived the most profit, and when, after the Revolution, this {{resource}} failed, lace then being imported, she had financial difficulties. Soon after, she had the opportunity to tutor three young men of her neighborhood in Latin and Greek; and so well was this work done that one of them afterward said that her tuition principally fitted him for college.|$|R
5000|$|... "Fibreglass {{reinforced}} plastics" [...] or FRPs (commonly {{referred to}} simply as fibreglass) use textile grade glass fibres. These textile fibres {{are different from}} other forms of glass fibres used to deliberately trap air, for insulating applications (see glass wool). Textile glass fibres begin as varying combinations of SiO2, Al2O3, B2O3, CaO, or MgO in powder form. These mixtures are then heated through direct melting to temperatures around 1300 degrees Celsius, after which dies are used to extrude filaments of glass fibre in diameter ranging from 9 to 17 µm. These filaments are then wound into larger threads and <b>spun</b> onto <b>bobbins</b> for transportation and further processing. Glass fibre {{is by far the}} most popular means to reinforce plastic and thus enjoys a wealth of production processes, some of which are applicable to aramid and carbon fibres as well owing to their shared fibrous qualities.|$|R
50|$|For {{automation}} in link spinning/winding {{there is}} the so-called “in-line steamer”. The first known process of this type is the Steamatic process by Resch. In this case the heat setting process happens in between the ring spinning and the winding machines. As soon as the ring spinning frame has finished <b>spinning,</b> the loaded <b>bobbins</b> are transported into the in-line steamer. Those bobbins are steamed there with a vacuum method and dried again within seconds. After steaming and drying, the bobbins are transported on to the winding machine where they are re-wound onto a cross-wound package.|$|R
25|$|When skeining from wheel <b>spun</b> yarn, the <b>bobbin</b> {{can either}} {{be removed from the}} wheel and placed on a kate, or skeined {{directly}} from the wheel. If the bobbin is left on the wheel the tension on the drive band must be lessened in order to allow the bobbin to turn freely. Yarn spun on spindles {{can either be}} left on the spindle, or slipped onto a dowel for plying. The spindle or dowel is either placed in a lazy kate, or even a bowl to keep the spindle in one place while winding off the yarn.|$|R
2500|$|In mule {{spinning}} the roving is {{pulled off a}} bobbin and fed through some rollers, which are feeding at several different speeds. This thins the roving at a consistent rate. If the roving was not a consistent size, then this step could cause {{a break in the}} yarn, or could jam the machine. The yarn is twisted through the <b>spinning</b> of the <b>bobbin</b> as the carriage moves out, and is rolled onto a cylinder called a spindle, which then produces a cone-shaped bundle of fibres known as a [...] "cop", as the carriage returns. Mule spinning produces a finer thread than the less skilled ring spinning.|$|R
50|$|In a {{spinning}} mule, the roving is pulled off bobbins and sequentially fed through rollers operating at several different speeds, thinning the roving at a consistent rate. The yarn is twisted through the <b>spinning</b> of the <b>bobbin</b> as the carriage moves out, and is rolled onto a cop as the carriage returns. Mule spinning produces a finer thread than ring spinning. Spinning by the mule machine is an intermittent process as the frame advances and returns. It is the descendant of a device invented in 1779 by Samuel Crompton, and produces a softer, less twisted thread that is favored for fines and for weft.|$|R

There are descriptions of kneading-troughs for robot skin, great vats for liver and brains, and a factory for producing bones. Nerve fibers, arteries, and intestines are <b>spun</b> on factory <b>bobbins,</b> while the Robots themselves are assembled like automobiles.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{high-speed}} traversing mechanism {{using two}} electro-rheological clutches is described. An {{application of the}} traversing mechanism is in winding textile filaments onto <b>spinning</b> or weaving <b>bobbins.</b> The design specifications are a traverse speed of 5 m/s; a turn round period of 10 – 20 ms and a traverse length of 250 mm. The turn round position must be controllable and repeatable within 1 mm and the traverse length requires to be periodically varied in order to shape {{the ends of the}} resulting bobbin. These combined criteria of high speed and controllability makes the use of electro-rheological fluids an attractive proposition. The paper considers the effects of the main geometric and fluid parameters on the performance of the mechanism and uses this to outline the limiting performance of the mechanism, together with the effects on the precision of the mechanism. The paper also outlines control aspects of the mechanism and uses this to indicate important areas for consideration in the future development of electro-rheological fluids. Key Words: electro-rheological fluids, high-speed mechanisms, high-speed clutche...|$|R
