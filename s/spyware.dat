5|$|Announced September 8, 2003, version 2004 adds adware, <b>spyware,</b> and {{keylogger}} protection. PC Magazine {{found the}} added protection to be weak. Out of the <b>spyware</b> samples Norton detected, {{a significant number}} were not removed completely, requiring manual removal. Norton also did little to prevent <b>spyware</b> infections.|$|E
5|$|The {{installation}} {{was noted}} as lengthy by PC Magazine, especially on malware-infected systems. <b>Spyware</b> detection has been tweaked {{since the last}} release. It has been updated to better identify keyloggers. In PC Magazine testing, Norton successfully detected all 11 <b>spyware</b> threats and removed all but two. PC Magazine did give Norton credit even when manual removal was required. The suite also removed three of four commercial keyloggers. When attempting to install the <b>spyware</b> on a clean system, Norton blocked all 11 {{and two of the}} four commercial keyloggers. In most cases, it did not block the installation, however Norton did call for a scan after the <b>spyware</b> was installed. In PC Pro testing, Norton detected 78 percent of <b>spyware,</b> removed 82 percent, and blocked 65 percent from installing.|$|E
5|$|In PC Magazine testing, Norton {{detected}} 15 of 16 <b>spyware</b> samples. 13 of the 16 were removed. Against eight commercial keyloggers, {{the suite}} removed all the samples. On a clean system, Norton blocked 14 of the 16 <b>spyware</b> samples from installing, and stopped {{seven of the}} eight keyloggers from installing.|$|E
5|$|AntiVirus Protection: Protects your Mac®, iPhoto® pictures, iTunes® media, iMovie® {{projects}} {{and all your}} important stuff from viruses, <b>spyware</b> and other threats without slowing down your computer.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Fortinet {{researchers}} said a Facebook widget from Zango had tricked {{more than}} three million users into downloading malicious <b>spyware</b> under the guise of telling users their secret crush. Zango denied the allegations, saying their software was opt-in.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) is an {{antivirus}} software (AV) product that provides protection against {{different types of}} malicious software such as computer viruses, <b>spyware,</b> rootkits and Trojan horses. Before version 4.5, MSE ran on , Windows Vista and Windows 7, but not on Windows 8 and later, which have built-in AV components. MSE 4.5 and later do not run on Windows XP. The license agreement allows home users and small businesses to install and use the product free of charge. It replaces Windows Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, and the free Windows Defender, which until Windows 8 protected users from only adware and <b>spyware.</b>|$|E
5|$|On August 14, 2006, Rob McKenna, the Attorney General of {{the state}} of Washington charged Movieland, Digital Enterprises, Herd, and Garroni with violating the state's Computer <b>Spyware</b> Act and its Consumer Protection Act.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendants}} {{were subject to}} fines of up to $100,000 per violation of the <b>Spyware</b> Act and $2,000 per violation of the Consumer Protection Act if found liable. They were also subject to paying restitution to affected consumers.|$|E
5|$|CryptoWall 3.0 used a payload {{written in}} JavaScript {{as part of}} an email attachment, which {{downloads}} executables disguised as JPG images. To further evade detection, the malware creates new instances of explorer.exe and svchost.exe to communicate with its servers. When encrypting files, the malware also deletes volume shadow copies, and installs <b>spyware</b> that steals passwords and Bitcoin wallets.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, Fortinet {{created a}} {{standalone}} subsidiary, Fortinet Federal, focused on cybersecurity products for government agencies. Former National Security Agency director Mike McConnell is on Fortinet Federal’s board, and 12 of the 15 U.S. Cabinet departments use Fortinet products. That same year, Fortinet researchers discovered a <b>spyware</b> that scams victims by impersonating the IRS and MacRansom, a ransomware program specifically targeting Mac computers.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials is an {{antivirus}} software (AV) product that fights malicious software (malware), including computer viruses, <b>spyware,</b> Trojan horses and rootkits. It replaces Windows Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, {{and the free}} Windows Defender, which until Windows 8 only protected users from adware and <b>spyware.</b> It automatically checks for and downloads the virus definitions it relies on from Microsoft Update, a web-based software service updated three times a day. Users may alternatively download the updates manually from the Microsoft Security Portal website. On 30 September 2011, a faulty definition update caused the product to incorrectly tag Google Chrome as malware. The issue was resolved within three hours. MSE originally ran on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7, although versions 4.5 and later do not run on Windows XP and Microsoft stopped producing definition updates for Windows XP on 14 July 2015.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009, AV-TEST {{conducted}} {{a series of}} trials on the final build of the product in which it detected and caught 98.44 percent of 545,034 computer viruses, computer worms and software Trojan horses as well as 90.95 percent of 14,222 <b>spyware</b> and adware samples. It also detected and eliminated all 25 tested rootkits, generating no false-positives. Between June 2010 to January 2013, AV-TEST tested Microsoft Security Essentials 14 times; in 11 out of 14 cases, MSE secured AV-TEST certification of outperforming AV industry average ratings. Microsoft Security Essentials 2.0 was tested and certified on March 2011. The product achieved a protection score of 2.5 out of 6, a repair score of 3.5 out of 6 and a usability score of 5.5 out of 6. Report details show that although version 2.0 was able to find all malware samples of the WildList (widespread malware), it was not able to stop all Internet-based attacks because it lacks personal firewall and anti-spam capabilities. In an April 2012 test, version 2.1 achieved scores of 3.0, 5.5 and 5.0 for protection, repair and usability. Version 4.0 for Windows 7 SP1 (x64) was tested in June 2012 and achieved scores of 2.5, 5.5 and 5.5 for protection, repair and usability. In October 2012, the product lost its AV-TEST certification when Microsoft Security Essentials 4.1 achieved scores of 1.5, 3.5 and 5.5 for its protection, repair and usability.|$|E
25|$|As the <b>spyware</b> threat has worsened, {{a number}} of {{techniques}} have emerged to counteract it. These include programs designed to remove or block <b>spyware,</b> as well as various user practices which reduce the chance of getting <b>spyware</b> on a system.|$|E
25|$|HuntBar, aka WinTools or Adware.Websearch, was {{installed}} by an ActiveX drive-by download at affiliate Web sites, or by advertisements displayed by other <b>spyware</b> programs—an {{example of how}} <b>spyware</b> can install more <b>spyware.</b> These programs add toolbars to IE, track aggregate browsing behavior, redirect affiliate references, and display advertisements.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, <b>spyware</b> {{remains a}} costly problem. When {{a large number}} of pieces of <b>spyware</b> have {{infected}} a Windows computer, the only remedy may involve backing up user data, and fully reinstalling the operating system. For instance, some <b>spyware</b> cannot be completely removed by Symantec, Microsoft, PC Tools.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, lawmakers {{introduced}} a bill in 2005 entitled the Internet <b>Spyware</b> Prevention Act, which would imprison creators of <b>spyware.</b>|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{some types}} of <b>spyware</b> disable {{software}} firewalls and antivirus software, and/or reduce browser security settings, which opens the system to further opportunistic infections. Some <b>spyware</b> disables or even removes competing <b>spyware</b> programs, {{on the grounds that}} more spyware-related annoyances increase the likelihood that users will take action to remove the programs.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2005 {{study by}} AOL and the National Cyber-Security Alliance, 61 percent of {{surveyed}} users' computers were infected with form of <b>spyware.</b> 92 percent of surveyed users with <b>spyware</b> {{reported that they}} did not know of its presence, and 91 percent reported that they had not given permission for the installation of the <b>spyware.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Spyware</b> {{producers}} argue that, {{contrary to}} the users' claims, users do in fact give consent to installations. <b>Spyware</b> that comes bundled with shareware applications may be described in the legalese text of an end-user license agreement (EULA). Many users habitually ignore these purported contracts, but <b>spyware</b> companies such as Claria say these demonstrate that users have consented.|$|E
25|$|Such {{programs}} {{inspect the}} contents of the Windows registry, operating system files, and installed programs, and remove files and entries which match a list of known <b>spyware.</b> Real-time protection from <b>spyware</b> works identically to real-time anti-virus protection: the software scans disk files at download time, and blocks the activity of components known to represent <b>spyware.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Windows Registry {{contains}} multiple sections where {{modification of}} key values allows software {{to be executed}} automatically when the operating system boots. <b>Spyware</b> can exploit this design to circumvent attempts at removal. The <b>spyware</b> typically will link itself from each location in the registry that allows execution. Once running, the <b>spyware</b> will periodically check {{if any of these}} links are removed. If so, they will be automatically restored. This ensures that the <b>spyware</b> will execute when the operating system is booted, even if some (or most) of the registry links are removed.|$|E
25|$|A <b>spyware</b> program rarely {{operates}} {{alone on}} a computer; an affected machine usually has multiple infections. Users frequently notice unwanted behavior and degradation of system performance. A <b>spyware</b> infestation can create significant unwanted CPU activity, disk usage, and network traffic. Stability issues, such as applications freezing, failure to boot, and system-wide crashes are also common. <b>Spyware,</b> which interferes with networking software commonly causes difficulty connecting to the Internet.|$|E
25|$|If a <b>spyware</b> {{program is}} not blocked and manages to get itself installed, it may resist {{attempts}} to terminate or uninstall it. Some programs work in pairs: when an anti-spyware scanner (or the user) terminates one running process, the other one respawns the killed program. Likewise, some <b>spyware</b> will detect attempts to remove registry keys and immediately add them again. Usually, booting the infected computer in safe mode allows an anti-spyware program {{a better chance of}} removing persistent <b>spyware.</b> Killing the process tree may also work.|$|E
25|$|Unauthorized {{access to}} a {{computer}} is illegal under computer crime laws, such as the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the U.K.'s Computer Misuse Act, and similar laws in other countries. Since owners of computers infected with <b>spyware</b> generally claim that they never authorized the installation, a prima facie reading {{would suggest that the}} promulgation of <b>spyware</b> would count as a criminal act. Law enforcement has often pursued the authors of other malware, particularly viruses. However, few <b>spyware</b> developers have been prosecuted, and many operate openly as strictly legitimate businesses, though some have faced lawsuits.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spyware</b> {{does not}} {{necessarily}} spread {{in the same way}} as a virus or worm because infected systems generally do not attempt to transmit or copy the software to other computers. Instead, <b>spyware</b> installs itself on a system by deceiving the user or by exploiting software vulnerabilities.|$|E
25|$|Malicious programmers have {{released}} {{a large number}} of rogue (fake) anti-spyware programs, and widely distributed Web banner ads can warn users that their computers have been infected with <b>spyware,</b> directing them to purchase programs which do not actually remove spyware—or else, may add more <b>spyware</b> of their own.|$|E
25|$|Former New York State Attorney General {{and former}} Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer has pursued <b>spyware</b> {{companies}} for fraudulent installation of software. In a suit brought in 2005 by Spitzer, the California firm Intermix Media, Inc. ended up settling, {{by agreeing to}} pay US$7.5million and to stop distributing <b>spyware.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some copy-protection {{technologies}} have borrowed from <b>spyware.</b> In 2005, Sony BMG Music Entertainment {{was found to}} be using rootkits in its XCP digital rights management technology Like <b>spyware,</b> not only was it difficult to detect and uninstall, it was so poorly written that most efforts to remove it could have rendered computers unable to function.|$|E
25|$|Some ISPs—particularly {{colleges and}} universities—have taken a {{different}} approach to blocking spyware: they use their network firewalls and web proxies to block access to Web sites known to install <b>spyware.</b> On March 31, 2005, Cornell University's Information Technology department released a report detailing the behavior of one particular piece of proxy-based <b>spyware,</b> Marketscore, and the steps the university took to intercept it. Many other educational institutions have taken similar steps.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spyware</b> is a {{piece of}} {{software}} that obtains information from a user's computer without that user's consent.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} on December 24, 2005 that then-Florida Attorney General Charlie Crist was investigating Sony BMG <b>spyware.</b>|$|E
25|$|On January 26, 2006, Microsoft and the Washington state {{attorney}} general filed suit against Secure Computer for its <b>Spyware</b> Cleaner product.|$|E
25|$|A popular generic <b>spyware</b> {{removal tool}} used by those that {{requires}} {{a certain degree of}} expertise is HijackThis, which scans certain areas of the Windows OS where <b>spyware</b> often resides and presents a list with items to delete manually. As most of the items are legitimate windows files/registry entries it is advised for those who are less knowledgeable on this subject to post a HijackThis log on the numerous antispyware sites and let the experts decide what to delete.|$|E
25|$|On November 21, 2005, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott sued Sony BMG. Texas was {{the first}} state in the United States to bring legal action against Sony BMG in {{response}} to the rootkit. The suit was also the first filed under the state’s 2005 <b>spyware</b> law. It alleged that the company surreptitiously installed the <b>spyware</b> on millions of compact music discs (CDs) that consumers inserted into their computers when they play the CDs, which can compromise the systems.|$|E
25|$|Before Internet Explorer 6 SP2 was {{released}} {{as part of}} Windows XP Service Pack 2, the browser would automatically display an installation window for any ActiveX component that a website wanted to install. The combination of user ignorance about these changes, and the assumption by Internet Explorer that all ActiveX components are benign, helped to spread <b>spyware</b> significantly. Many <b>spyware</b> components would also make use of exploits in JavaScript, Internet Explorer and Windows to install without user knowledge or permission.|$|E
25|$|They {{can provide}} {{real-time}} protection {{in a manner}} similar to that of anti-virus protection: they scan all incoming network data for <b>spyware</b> and blocks any threats it detects.|$|E
