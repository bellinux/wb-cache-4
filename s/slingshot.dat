5|$|In Angry Birds, {{the player}} {{controls}} {{a flock of}} multi-colored birds that are attempting to retrieve their eggs, which have been stolen {{by a group of}} hungry green pigs. In each stage of the gameplay, enemy pigs are sheltered by structures made of various materials such as wood, glass, and stone resembling children's toy building blocks. The objective of the game is to eliminate all the pigs on the level. Using a <b>slingshot,</b> players launch a limited set of birds with the goal of either striking the enemy pigs directly or damaging their surrounding structures, causing the blocks to collapse and squash the pigs. The player must set the angle and force of the bird's travel by pulling back on the <b>slingshot</b> (using intuitive touch-controls in the mobile versions). The launch process is quick and casual, with no visible trajectory data, and a player simply selects a point in the X-Y field behind the launch post from which the virtual <b>slingshot</b> will be released. In various stages of the game, additional objects such as TNT crates and rocks are incorporated into the structures, and power-ups may be used to enhance the birds to attack hard-to-reach pigs.|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} of paintball uses <b>slingshots</b> instead of markers to propel the paintballs. Because <b>slingshots</b> may shoot faster than 90 m/s, sometimes up to 150 m/s, most paintball fields don’t allow them. A normal game usually requires all players to use <b>slingshots,</b> but some games may allow certain players to use pump-action markers vs. <b>slingshots,</b> such as Cowboys and Indians.|$|R

5|$|Amir {{meets the}} man, who reveals himself as Assef. Sohrab is being kept at Assef's house. Assef agrees to {{relinquish}} him if Amir can beat {{him in a}} fight. Assef then badly beats Amir, breaking several bones, until Sohrab uses a <b>slingshot</b> to fire a brass ball into Assef's left eye. Sohrab helps Amir out of the house, where he passes out and wakes up in a hospital.|$|E
5|$|Assef, {{an older}} {{boy with a}} sadistic taste for violence, mocks Amir for socializing with a Hazara, which is, {{according}} to Assef, an inferior race whose members belong only in Hazarajat. One day, he prepares to attack Amir with brass knuckles, but Hassan defends Amir, threatening to shoot out Assef's eye with his <b>slingshot.</b> Assef backs off but swears to get revenge.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Dawn of Mana {{takes place in a}} full three-dimensional world, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the main character, Keldric, and is followed for almost all of the game by a fairy spirit, Faye. Unlike previous {{games in the}} series, Dawn is an action-adventure game, rather than an action role-playing game; as such, gameplay is focused on movement and attacking enemies, rather than leveling-up character statistics. Keldric is able to run, roll, and jump through the game world. Keldric has access to a vine-like plant attached to his arm, which can be used at any time as either a sword, a whip, or a <b>slingshot.</b> The sword can be used to hit enemies and objects, the whip can grab and throw enemies and objects, and the <b>slingshot</b> can throw collectible pebbles as projectiles. Faye can cast magic spells, selectable by the player.|$|E

5|$|In the game, players use a <b>slingshot</b> {{to launch}} birds at pigs {{stationed}} in or around various structures {{with the goal}} of destroying all the pigs on the playing field. As players advance through the game new types of birds become available, some with special abilities that can be activated by the player. Rovio Mobile has supported Angry Birds with numerous free updates that add additional game content, and the company has also released stand-alone holiday and promotional versions of the game.|$|E
5|$|The China National Space Administration offers NASA the Taiyang Shen, a {{classified}} booster rocket that {{can carry a}} payload to Mars. Meanwhile, JPL astrodynamicist Rich Purnell devises a trajectory to divert Hermes back to Mars for a rescue {{more than two years}} earlier, using the Chinese booster to resupply Hermes for an additional eighteen months. Sanders rejects the plan, refusing to risk the crew, but Henderson surreptitiously sends the details to Hermes. The crew unanimously vote for the plan, and NASA — powerless to stop them — resupplies Hermes as it uses Earth's gravity to <b>slingshot</b> back to Mars.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} race, Greg Biffle {{was the leader}} at the start. On the fourth lap, Kenseth passed Biffle {{to take over the}} lead. He lost the {{position}} when Joey Logano and Kyle Busch moved into the top two places. Biffle passed Kyle Busch by the 29th lap and held it during his pit stop 14 laps later. With three laps remaining in the race, Kenseth attempted a race-winning <b>slingshot</b> and passed Biffle when the final lap started and held it to win the second Gatorade Duel. There were five lead changes among five different drivers and no cautions were shown {{during the course of the}} second race.|$|E
50|$|<b>Slingshots</b> {{have been}} used as {{military}} weapons, but primarily by guerrilla forces due to the primitive resources and technology required to construct one.

5|$|The {{children}} liked animals, {{and their}} menagerie included dogs, cats, birds, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, a Shetland pony and a parrot. The children once used their animals {{to conduct a}} circus {{on the grounds of}} the Governor's Mansion. Hogg charged each visitor five cents, but was forced to return the money when her father discovered the scheme. In later years, the family added a bear, a horse, a fawn, cockatoos, and two ostriches named Jack and Jill to their collection of animals. In response to a challenge from her brothers, Hogg once mounted one of the ostriches, but was thrown from its back after one of the boys hit it with a <b>slingshot.</b> Ima and her ostriches later became the protagonists of a picture book, Ima & the Great Texas Ostrich Race, by Margaret Olivia McManis and Bruce Dupree.|$|E
5|$|Virgin Interactive {{produced}} an adventure {{game for the}} series named Cover-Up At Roswell, released in August 1996. Known as Escape from Quest World in development, Roswell cost $1million to make. Virgin handled all marketing, sales, and distribution; Turner cross-promoted. Developers recycled fifty minutes of footage and art from six season one episodes to construct a new story about the Quest family gathering alien artifacts and saving an extraterrestrial from autopsy at The Pentagon. Jeremiah Surd and the Men in Black of General Tyler plan to misuse the technology and try to hinder the Quests. Gameplay consists of clicking areas on images of locations to navigate paths. Players sometimes encounter minigames, such as guiding a diving bell away from rocks or shooting rats with a <b>slingshot.</b> Virgin designed certain segments to be viewed with packaged stereostopic Chromatek plastic glasses.|$|E
5|$|William D. Haywood {{was born}} in 1869 in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. His father, a former Pony Express rider, died of {{pneumonia}} when Haywood was three years old. His maternal grandfather was an Afrikaner born in the Orange Free State in 1820. At age nine, he injured his right eye while whittling a <b>slingshot</b> with a knife, permanently blinding his right eye. Haywood never had his damaged eye replaced with a glass eye; when photographed, he would turn his head to show his left profile. That same year, he began working in the mines, never having received much formal education. After brief stints as a cowboy and a homesteader, he returned to mining in 1896. High-profile {{events such as the}} gradual demise of the Molly Maguires, the Haymarket Massacre in 1886 and the Pullman Strike in 1894 fostered Haywood's interest in the labor movement.|$|E

5|$|Dawn of Mana {{opens on}} the fictional island of Illusia, {{a place where}} the giant Mana Tree lies dormant. Much of the story takes place on Fa'Diel, a {{continent}} composed of the five nations of Jadd, Topple, Ishe, Wendell, and Lorimar. At the start of the game Ritzia, a Maiden in charge of tending to the Tree, and Keldric, her knight and the player-controlled character, have left their village to find Ritzia's missing pet. While they are out, Illusia is attacked by King Stroud of Lorimar. The pair rush to the Tree of Mana, thinking that Stroud intends to attack the legendary beast that lies sleeping underneath its roots. While searching for the beast, Keldric finds a seed of the Tree, which attaches to his arm and can transform into a <b>slingshot,</b> a whip, or a sword. They also find Faye, a spirit child, who can cast magic and joins them. When they reach the center of the labyrinth of roots, Stroud's men catch up to them; they had been searching for Ritzia, not the beast. Stroud intends to open a portal to Mavolia, a land of darkness sealed away for centuries, and believes Ritzia is part of the key as a Maiden had been a part of opening the portal before. Stroud leaves with Ritzia to find the rest of the key, and Keldric and Faye chase after them.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a {{proposal}} for an asteroid mission was submitted to the European Space Agency (ESA). Named the Asteroidal Gravity Optical and Radar Analysis (AGORA), this spacecraft was to launch some time in 1990–1994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids. The preferred target for this mission was Vesta. AGORA would reach the asteroid belt either by a gravitational <b>slingshot</b> trajectory past Mars or {{by means of a}} small ion engine. However, the proposal was refused by the ESA. A joint NASA–ESA asteroid mission was then drawn up for a Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar Electric Propulsion (MAOSEP), with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of Vesta. NASA indicated they were not interested in an asteroid mission. Instead, the ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive. Other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by France, Germany, Italy and the United States, but none were approved. Exploration of Vesta by fly-by and impacting penetrator was the second main target of the first plan of the multi-aimed Soviet Vesta mission, developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991–1994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding.|$|E
5|$|Johnson went up {{the track}} on lap 52, but regained control of his car. Six laps later, after the leaders ran single file, Kenseth {{received}} help from Johnson while running on the outside line {{to prepare for a}} race winning <b>slingshot.</b> Kenseth slid underneath teammate Biffle as they started the final lap, as Biffle attempted to block Kenseth. Kenseth maintained the lead and crossed the finish line on lap 60 to win the race, with Smith in second and Johnson third. Sadler and Biffle rounded out the top five finishers. Blaney and Nemechek earned the second pair of transfer spots to qualify for the Daytona 500. Bayne, Tony Raines and David Stremme secured qualification for the Daytona 500 based on their lap times in the qualifier, with Terry Labonte using a champion's provisional to qualify. The following six drivers failed to qualify for the Daytona 500 because they did not finish high enough in their respective Duels or turn a fast-enough qualifying lap: Waltrip, Richardson, Bill Elliott, Mike Wallace, Kenny Wallace and J.J. Yeley. The second race had a total of five lead changes among four different drivers and no cautions were shown. Biffle's total of 40 laps led was the highest of any competitor. Kenseth led two times for a total of ten laps.|$|E

5|$|The 1976 Daytona 500 {{is known}} for the final lap battle between Pearson and Petty. In 2007, ESPN rated the race as the fourth most {{interesting}} Daytona 500. Petty was leading Pearson going into the last lap {{by a couple of}} car lengths. Pearson used the draft to attempt a <b>slingshot</b> pass against Petty {{at the end of the}} back stretch on the last lap, but his car pushed high into the final turn while going around another car. Petty edged under Pearson, and their cars crashed into each other on the frontstretch in the final turns. They both spun out into the infield grass approximately 100 feet (30 meters) short of the finish line. Benny Parsons who was driving the third place car, was over a lap behind the disabled cars. With Petty unable to restart his car, Pearson slowly drove his Wood Brothers Mercury over the grassy infield past the finish line for his only Daytona 500 victory. He won a series-best ten races in 1976, but finished ninth in season points after competing in only 22 of 30 events. He won his only IROC race at the first race of IROC III in 1975/1976 at Michigan International Speedway and finished fifth in points.|$|E
5|$|The {{video of}} the song {{features}} {{the majority of the}} film's cast at a celebration event where this song is performed. To entertain the attendees that have arrived at Pooja's (Renuka Shahane) baby shower, her sister Nisha (Madhuri Dixit) and her husband's cousin Rita (Sahila Chadha) arrange a comic skit. While Nisha is presented as a pregnant lady with a pillow stuffed belly, Rita is seen in a young man's get-up which resembles to that of Prem (Salman Khan) who is Pooja's devar (younger brother-in-law). Throughout the song's lyrics, Nisha tells everyone of how Prem is deewana (crazy) and always tries to woo girls. The fake Prem, i.e. Rita, always tries to flirt and tease all the ladies, especially Nisha. He also hits Nisha's bum with a marigold flower, using a <b>slingshot.</b> Afterwards, the fake Prem is shown being beaten by all the present ladies. Then, the real Prem, who was secretly watching the comic skit, comes in and hits Nisha's bum again with a marigold flower. Following this, Prem jumps off the balcony and hangs onto the chandelier. Afraid of being caught red handed in imitating him, Nisha and Rita try to run away. Surprisingly, Prem begs pardon for his behaviour towards Nisha. The video ends with Prem faking a pregnant lady in lingerie. The clip has a large group of female dancers dancing in-sync in the background. Amongst the prominent star cast of the film, Bindu, Himani Shivpuri, Priya Arun, Laxmikant Berde, are also seen throughout the video.|$|E
