25|$|There is {{no formal}} {{document}} or white {{paper from the}} government of Ontario actually explaining how the current system is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Although the provincial government officially describes the system it has established as a 'hybrid' of planning and market models, debates {{on the merits of}} a centrally planned system versus a competitive market approach persist.|$|E

They had two daughters, Tenya and Taryn. Eugene, whose father owned the Chevrolet dealership in Hillsboro, Oregon, was serving in the Air Defense Command when they were married. The couple moved to Hillsboro after Eugene was told officer's wives were not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many real {{dynamical}} {{systems do}} not exactly fit this model. In fact, unmodelled dynamics can seriously degrade the filter performance, {{even when it}} was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with unknown stochastic signals as inputs. The {{reason for this is that}} the effect of unmodelled dynamics depends on the input, and, therefore, can bring the estimation algorithm to instability (it diverges). On the other hand, independent white noise signals will not make the algorithm diverge. The problem of distinguishing between measurement noise and unmodelled dynamics is a difficult one and is treated in control theory under the framework of robust control.|$|E
25|$|Vicky (Sally Ann Marsh) - Mrs Dribelle's niece. She was {{supposed}} to have been an accountant, but Vicky had dreams of being part of a band. She moves into the upstairs flat in after Alec Smart is thrown out. She is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for her auntie, but she is always secretly auditioning for jobs as a drummer. She hides her drum kit in the bath when Mrs Dribelle visits as she disapproves of it. Vicky and Badger got on very well as they both love mashed potato. She ended up going on tour with a travelling band as a drummer. Vicky only appeared in Series 7.|$|E
25|$|The La Copa Junior tournament did {{not return}} until 2005 when CMLL revived the concept and {{presented}} it as an annual recurring tournament. Like the 1996 version the 2005 tournament played out over 2 editions of CMLL's Super Viernes shows, on February 22, 2005 and March 1, 2005. Héctor Garza was originally <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> the tournament, {{but was unable to}} return to Mexico due to commitments in the United States of America and had to be replaced by Apolo Dantés. Olímpico was unable to compete due to a neck injury, forcing CMLL to replace him with Máscara Mágica and the 1996 winner Emilio Charles Jr. had {{to pull out of the}} tournament due to a hand injury, he was replaced by Brazo de Oro. The tournament came down to Dr. Wagner Jr. and Shocker facing off in the finals, with Shocker winning the whole tournament.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a new small-signal {{model for}} the Class-E DC-DC {{converter}} with piezoelectric transformer is presented. The model was obtained using the generalized averaging method, through Fourier harmonics approximation. The model describes all poles and zeros of the system, being accurate for heavy and light loads. The converter was <b>suppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> under Zero Voltage Switching conditions, and this information was used to simplify the model derivation. Experimental frequency responses demonstrate similar results with the presented model, what validates the method for a higher order resonant converter. The measurements were achieved for a 3 W step-down converter, with universal 85 - 265 V AC input and 6 V DC output voltages...|$|R
50|$|In March 2017, city's Transportation Secretariat sent a memo {{in which}} {{warned that the}} project is not {{adjusted}} for such a major traffic section. Secretariat warned that the planned dispersion of the water will make the roads wet and slippery in summer and create ice in winter, as it is <b>suppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> throughout the year, thanks to the special heaters. They concluded that the fountain projected that way is not suitable for the highly frequent roundabout but rather for the parks and open green areas and that it can endanger the traffic. Ban on further construction was suggested if the inadequacies are not fixed. Solution {{turned out to be}} a changed direction of the sprinklers, 74 out of 458, within the fountain.|$|R
25|$|Women’s {{participation}} on {{the home}} front was essential to the war effort. Leading into the Second World War, the ‘breadwinner model’ indicated that married women belonged in the home, with men working. Men were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and play in the public domain with the private realm supposedly being the domain of women. The outbreak of World War II forced society to rethink women’s role outside of the home. The largest contribution by the majority of Canadian women was through unpaid volunteer work, through their domestic abilities and skills; women were able to support the nation and the war effort. The government called upon women to participate in volunteer programs. Women began collecting recycled items such as paper, metal, fat, bones, rags, rubber, and glass. Clothing was also collected by Canadian women for free distribution overseas. They also prepared care packages to send to the men and women overseas. Canadian women were responsible for maintaining the morale of the nation. All over Canada, women responded to demands made upon them by not only selling war savings stamps and certificates but purchasing them as well, and collecting money to by bombers and mobile canteens. If you were a young unattached woman in 1939, the war offered unprecedented opportunities {{on the home}} front. Young women were given a chance to move away from home, go to parties and dances in the name of patriotic duty.|$|E
500|$|The Brazilian {{naval fleet}} in Uruguay was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in {{conjunction}} with a Brazilian land force. But months passed, and the [...] "Army of the South" [...] (called the [...] "Division of Observation" [...] until the ultimatum) stationed in Piraí Grande (in Rio Grande do Sul) was still not ready to cross into Uruguayan territory. Its main objectives were to occupy the Uruguayan towns of Paysandú, Salto and Melo; once taken, they were to be handed over to Flores and his Colorados.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the local}} {{newspapers}} were quick {{to respond to the}} rebellion. An article in The Craftsman dated 2 June 1733 described the actors as [...] "malecontent Players" [...] who were busy in mutiny. On 7 June, the Grub-Street Journal stated, in an article by Musaeus, that Theophilus was selfish. Another article in the Grub-Street Journal, by Philo Dramaticus, attacked the management for not understanding how theatres are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> The managers were the first to state their defence and argued that everything they did was correct and that the actors had no reason to complain, especially over the treatment that they received.|$|E

50|$|Here populations with {{a society}} {{structure}} are modeled by so-called resource-dependent branching processes (RDBPs).The objective of RDBPs is to model different society structures and {{to compare the}} advantages and disadvantages of different societies, with the focus being on human societies. A RDBP is a discrete time branching process (BP) in which individuals are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in order <b>to</b> be able to live and to reproduce. The population decides on a current society form by a policy, that is a prescription of rules how available resources are to be distributed among the individuals. Policies may change over the generations by the interaction of individuals.|$|R

500|$|After a few months, Schudde was {{surprised}} that Bakshi was still showing up to work, and promoted him to cel painter. Bakshi began to practice animating; to give himself more time, {{at one point he}} slipped ten cels he was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on into the [...] "to-do" [...] pile of a fellow painter, Leo Giuliani. Bakshi's deception was not noticed until two days later, when he was called to Schudde's office because the cels had been painted on the wrong side. When Bakshi explained that Giuliani had made the mistake, an argument ensued between the three. Schudde eventually took Bakshi's side. By this point, the studio's employees were aware of Bakshi's intention to become an animator, and he began to receive help and advice from established animators, including Connie Rasinski, Manny Davis, Jim Tyer, Larry Silverman and Johnnie Gentilella.|$|E
500|$|To {{create a}} more urban record, Milian had a list of {{producers}} {{that she wanted to}} work with for So Amazin. She said that in most cases, even when she had R producers, most songs would end up being pop instead of R L.A. Reid suggested to Milian that she should work with Cool & Dre, with whom she ended up working with as the first people to start off the album. Although Milian was originally <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with several different music producers, she felt that the chemistry they had in the first week was so [...] "instant and real" [...] that she felt she could not get a better [...] "vibe" [...] with anybody else other than them. Together, they produced four songs in the first few days, which prompted Milian to ask her label if she could continue working with the duo. At the same time, Cool & Dre called their managers to ask if they could continue working with Milian. Milian felt that it was [...] "just the perfect connection", and that working with them [...] "just felt so original". The singer described Cool & Dre as [...] "beat makers", rather than just hip-hop producers, and believed that she was really able to express herself lyrically through their music.|$|E
500|$|Whereas Milian's {{previous}} albums had pop and R stylings, she {{was encouraged}} by Island Def Jam to target a new audience and release an urban record. Explaining the change, Milian {{said that one of}} her main problems was that previous releases would often find mainstream success, but would be relatively unsuccessful on urban radio. As an R artist, she wanted to build her core audience–a true fan base that would support her through time–to increase her career's longevity. The main purpose of her genre change was {{to go back to the}} streets and add to her core audience. To create a more urban record, Milian had a list of producers that she wanted to work with. L.A.

500|$|Limbaugh's {{appearance}} in the episode has drawn both praise and criticism from news outlets, including Daniel Foster of National Review who commented, [...] "It is to Mr. Limbaugh's credit that he can make fun of himself. But Seth MacFarlane, the whiskey-soaked Dada creator of Family Guy, is responsible for more sophomoric cartooning than the combined patrons of America’s truck stop and dive bar bathrooms." [...] Foster went on to add, [...] "I can only look at the Limbaugh-MacFarlane mash-up with a wary eye." [...] Columnist Matt Lewis of Politics Daily also questioned Limbaugh's appearance on Family Guy, citing his support for former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin, whose daughter, Bristol Palin, has openly criticized MacFarlane and called the show's writers [...] "heartless jerks." [...] In contrast, John Nolte of Andrew Breitbart's Big Hollywood wrote, [...] "What MacFarlane’s doing fits exactly into our template. He’s entitled to his opinion, {{worked very hard to}} reach the top of the most difficult business there is to succeed in, and in turn uses that forum to further his own agenda— that’s how it’s <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> But {{at the same time he}} doesn’t completely shut us out." [...] Prior to the episode's official broadcast on television in the United States, Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post called Limbaugh's guest {{appearance in}} the episode [...] "genuinely funny," [...] and David Weigel of Slate commented, [...] "I'm not at all surprised that Limbaugh would embrace the show and answer its mockery of conservatives; the plotline [...] is a perfect conservative narrative." ...|$|E
