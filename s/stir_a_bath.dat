30|$|Sol–gel methods, especially, the {{well-known}} ‘Pechini method’, {{have been another}} option for the synthesis of perovskite-type oxides in previous studies [66, 67]. This method involves the mixing of perovskite precursors in nitrate and oxide form followed {{by the addition of}} a chelating agent, ethylene glycol as the sol-forming product, desiccation and calcination. For example, Song et al. [67] prepared LaCrO 3 for Ni/MH batteries using the Pechini method. They used a mixture of La(NO 3) 3 · 6 H 2 O, Cr(NO 3) 3 · 9 H 2 O, citric acid, and ethylene glycol.

30|$|GO {{suspension}} {{was successfully}} prepared using modified Hummer’s method [19]. Graphite powder was mixed with concentrated H 2 SO 4 and continuously <b>stirred</b> in <b>an</b> ice <b>bath</b> for 10  min. Then, KMnO 4 was slowly added into the above solution {{with vigorous stirring}} for 6  h and {{the temperature of the}} mixture was kept below 20  °C. The mixture was then reacted for 2  h before being transferred to a 40  °C water bath with vigorously stirred. Next, the temperature of the solution was adjusted to a constant 90  °C for 60  min while water was added continuously. The mixture was stirred overnight for complete oxidation of the graphite. During the oxidation, the color of the suspension changed from dark purplish green to dark brown. Distilled water was added to the suspension followed by a few drops of H 2 O 2 to stop the oxidation process. The resultant GO suspension was centrifuged at 10 000  rpm and washed with 1.0  M HCl in aqueous solution to remove the unexfoliated particles.

Equations, correlating the electrolytes concentrations at pore bases during the oxide growth and the bath bulk concentrations with the charge transport numbers of the different ions, were also derived. These, referring to cylindrical pores, can be considered to be approximately applicable to the case of the real shape of elongated pores.

Its application provided, consistently with other experimental evidence, that a critical electrolyte concentration exists between 5 and 15 % w/v. Above the critical concentration the normal mechanism of oxide production and film growth is valid and the model applies; below the critical concentration, where the model does not apply, a deficient growth of the oxide is observed. The experimental results and their treatment by the developed model showed that the electrolyte concentration generally affects parameters such as the weight and porosity of the film, the pore base hemispherical surface area, the time at which the pore external diameter approaches cell width, the time interval in which the model applies, the parameters involved in the developed kinetic model, etc. Their variation with electrolyte concentration was well justified by the fact that the rate of the dissolution of the anodic Al 2 O 3 in an open circuit has a maximum at a specific concentration and the electrolyte concentration is variable along pores being maximum at pore bases...|$|R
