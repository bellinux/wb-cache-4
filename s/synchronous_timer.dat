30|$|A remote client {{machine was}} used to access the GSD tool running on the {{instance}} via its public IP address. Apache JMeter {{is used as a}} load balancer as well as a load generator to generate workload (i.e., requests) to the instance and monitor responses [37]. To measure the effect of tenant isolation, tenant 1 was configured to simulate a large instant load by: (i) increasing the number of requests using the thread count and loop count; (ii) increasing the size of the requests by attaching a large file to it; (iii) increasing the speed at which the requests are sent by reducing the ramp-up period by one-tenth, so that all the requests are sent ten times faster; and (iv) creating a heavy load burst by adding the <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Timer</b> to the Samplers in order to add delays between requests, such that a certain number of requests are fired at the same time. This treatment type can be likened to an unpredictable (i.e., sudden increase) workload [3] and aggressive load [17].|$|E
5000|$|The {{synchronous}} motor and induction motor {{are the most}} widely used types of AC motor. The difference between the two types is that the {{synchronous motor}} rotates at a rate locked to the line frequency. The synchronous motor does not rely on current induction to produce the rotor's magnetic field. By contrast, the induction motor requires [...] "slip", the rotor must rotate slightly slower than the AC current alternations, to induce current in the rotor winding. Small synchronous motors are used in timing applications such as in <b>synchronous</b> clocks, <b>timers</b> in appliances, tape recorders and precision servomechanisms in which the motor must operate at a precise speed; speed accuracy is that of the power line frequency, which is carefully controlled in large interconnected grid systems.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an architecture of signaldependent analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based on MINI-MAX sampling scheme that allows achieving high data compression rate and power reduction. The proposed architecture {{consists of a}} conventional <b>synchronous</b> ADC, a <b>timer</b> and a peak detector, and AD conversion is carried out only when input signal peaks are detected. To improve the accuracy of signal reconstruction, MINIMAX sampling is improved so that multiple points are captured for each peak, and its effectiveness is experimentally confirmed. In addition, power reduction, which is the primary advantage of the proposed signal-dependent ADC, is analytically discussed and then validated with circuit simulations. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} egg {{hatching}} was mostly done manually by humans, but {{the level of}} effectiveness and efficiency of time still less attention. The design tool automatically egg hatching began to be applied and developed to improve the effectiveness of egg hatching process itself. This final project design process of egg incubators with synchronous motor and a microcontroller as a regulator of temperature and humidity incubator space. Synchronous motor {{is used as a}} driving force to rotate the egg rack for eggs can be heated evenly. Rotating synchronous motors governed by a timer every 3 hours with rotation angle 25 °C. While the microcontroller serves to maintain temperature and humidity eggs in it so it remains constant in accordance with the desired temperature and humidity. In this case used as an object at room temperature regulated incubators. These eggs hatch tool uses <b>synchronous</b> motor, <b>timer,</b> microcontroller ATMega 16, LM 35 temperature sensors, transformers, Relays, LCD, Heater and Fan. Mikrokotroller ATMega 16 has shaped temperature sensor inputs. These sensors will detect the temperature within the incubator room and display it on the LCD. Incubator using a heater which is used as a heat source, and then blown into the incubator space for heat evenly within the incubator, so that the incubator will work automatically. This tool works automatically to respond to the temperature scale that is detected by the sensor temperature. Microcontroller then processes the temperature and gives the output that has been programmed in advance. The temperature is then displayed on the LCD. Heater and fan will turn on automatically when there are changes in temperature, adjusted for the program. These incubators require 80 watts of power and total electrical energy consumption for 1 - 14 days to incubate eggs...|$|R
