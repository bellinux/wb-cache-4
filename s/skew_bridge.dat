This paper clarifies the mechanism of rotations of <b>skewed</b> <b>bridges</b> and shows the effectiveness of cable restrainers on the mitigation of the rotations. Three configurations of cable restrainers are clarified here: 1) cable restrainers in the weak axis, 2) cable restrainers in the longitudinal direction, and 3) cable restrainers crossing the ends of adjacent decks.

40|$|In the US, nearly 33. 5 % {{of highway}} <b>bridges</b> are <b>skewed.</b> In the past, these <b>skewed</b> <b>bridges</b> have been {{analyzed}} as straight bridges. Nevertheless, there exists an extensive literature indicating the mechanical behavior of <b>skewed</b> <b>bridges</b> being {{quite different from}} their straight counterparts. In this thesis, {{to better understand the}} behavior of <b>skewed</b> <b>bridges,</b> experimental, numerical, and analytical researches have been conducted. The analytical method proposed here is {{the first of its kind}} in the <b>skewed</b> <b>bridge</b> research, and is expected to aid the bridge engineers with their design. First, a three dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) model was developed and was calibrated by the physical measurement results of a real <b>skewed</b> <b>bridge</b> over M- 85 and I- 75 in Michigan. In this FEA model, generic bridges with various parameters such as different diaphragm types, bearing types, girder spacings, girder types, span lengths, and skew angles were analyzed to study the behavior of <b>skewed</b> <b>bridges.</b> The results were compared to the AASHTO-LRFD Specifications and as expected it was observed that the specifications does not cover all the aspects of a <b>skewed</b> <b>bridge</b> behavior. In addition, analytical solutions for skewed thick plates under transverse load and <b>skewed</b> <b>bridges</b> subjected to truck load were developed. The thick plate solution was obtained in a framework of oblique coordinate system. The governing equation in that system was first derived and the solution was obtained using the deflection and rotation as derivatives of a potential function developed here. The solution technique was applied to two illustrative application examples and the results were compared with numerical solutions. The two approaches yielded results in good agreement. Then, <b>skewed</b> beam <b>bridges</b> were modeled as an assemblage of several individual skewed thick plates supported on beams. To confirm the validity of the analysis process and the solution obtained, the moment and shear responses to truck loads are acquired using the analytical method and compared with that from FEA. In addition, the lateral distribution factors for moment and shear used in routine design is investigated based on comparison of the analytical approach and FEA. Finally, suggestions for future research are presented, including development of the temperature effect analysis and dynamic analysis. These analyses will provide further understanding of the behavior of <b>skewed</b> <b>bridges...</b>|$|R

The contract was re-let to James Wilson of Pontefract on 28 May 1830 for £420, an increase of £93 over the original tender. As the principles were not completely understood, the work continued to prove difficult and its imminent collapse was solemnly predicted {{right up until the}} time, {{a few days before the}} opening of the branch, the centring was removed and the crown of the arch settled by less than half an inch (13mm).|$|E
40|$|T-beam Bridge is {{a common}} choice among the {{designers}} for small and medium span bridges. In order to cater to greater speed and more safety of present day traffic, the modern high ways are to be straight as far as possible. This requirement, along with other requirements for fixing alignment of the bridges, is mainly responsible for provision of increasing number of <b>skew</b> <b>bridges.</b> The presence of <b>skew</b> in a <b>bridge</b> makes the analysis and design of bridge decks intricate. For the T- beam <b>bridges</b> with small <b>skew</b> angle, it is frequently considered safe to ignore the angle of skew and analyze the bridge as a right bridge with a span equal to the skew span. However, T-beam bridges with large angle of skew can have a considerable effect {{on the behavior of}} the bridge especially in the short to medium range of spans. In this paper an analytical study using three dimensional finite element methods was performed to investigate the effect of skew angle on behavior of simply supported reinforced concrete T-beam bridge decks. The parameters investigated in this analytical study were the span lengths and skew angle. The finite element analysis (FEA) results for <b>skewed</b> <b>bridges</b> were compared to the reference straight bridges (nonskewed). The geometric dimensions of the T-beam bridge decks and the loading used are in compliance with AASHTO standard specifications. The FEA results and comparison of <b>skewed</b> <b>bridge</b> with straight bridge indicate that max. Live load bending moments and deflections decreases in T- beams for <b>skewed</b> <b>bridges,</b> while max. shear, torsion and supports reactions increases in some T-beams for <b>skewed</b> <b>bridges</b> for all considered span lengths (12, 16, 20 and 24 m). This study disagreement with the AASHTO standard specifications as well as the LRFD in recommending that <b>bridges</b> with <b>skew</b> angle less than or equal 20 ° be designed as straight (non <b>skewed)</b> <b>bridges</b> also it recommended that engineers are better to perform three dimensional finite element analysis for <b>skewed</b> T-beam <b>bridge</b> decks...|$|R
40|$|<b>Skew</b> <b>bridges</b> with separation/expansion joints {{are one of}} {{the most}} common types of {{existing}} bridges worldwide. Earthquake reconnaissance reports indicate that <b>skew</b> <b>bridges</b> often rotate in the horizontal plane, increasing the chances of unseating at their acute corners. This behaviour is triggered by the oblique, in-deck, contact which leads in coupling of the longitudinal and the transverse response, binding in one of the obtuse corners and subsequently rotation in the horizontal plane, in such a way that the skew angle increases. Despite the recorded evidence from previous earthquakes, and most empirical vulnerability methodologies, which acknowledge skew as a primary vulnerability factor of bridges, the relevant literature lacks a thorough theoretical study and is mostly confined to empirical descriptions of the phenomenon. This study examines both the case of deck-abutment impact, as well as, the impact between adjacent deck segments, of <b>skew</b> <b>bridges.</b> It shows that the coupling, and hence the unseating during an earthquake excitation, after deck-abutment collisions is not a factor of the skew angle alone, but rather of the total geometry in plan plus the contact parameters. Finally, it offers closed-form solutions for all physically feasible post-impact states observed in <b>skew</b> <b>bridges...</b>|$|R

30|$|The seismic {{vulnerability}} of highway bridges remains an important problem and has received increased attention {{as a consequence}} of unprecedented damage observed during several major earthquakes. A significant number of research studies have examined the performance of <b>skew</b> <b>bridges</b> under service and seismic loads. The results of these studies are particularly sensitive to modeling assumptions in view of the interacting parameters. In the present study, three-dimensional improved beam-stick models of two-span highway <b>bridges</b> with <b>skew</b> angles varying from 0 ° to 60 ° are developed to investigate the seismic response characteristics of <b>skew</b> box girder <b>bridges.</b> The relative accuracy of beam-stick models is verified against counterpart finite element models. The effect of various parameters and conditions on the overall seismic response was examined such as skew angle, ground motion intensity, soil condition, abutment support conditions, bridge aspect ratio, and foundation-base conditions. The study shows that the improved beam-stick models can be used to conduct accurate nonlinear time history analysis of <b>skew</b> <b>bridges.</b> <b>Skew</b> angle and interacting parameters were found to have significant effect on the behavior of <b>skewed</b> highway <b>bridges.</b> Furthermore, the performance of shear keys may have a predominant effect on the overall seismic response of the <b>skew</b> <b>bridges.</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{analytical and}} experimental investigation was undertaken {{to study the}} load distribution characteristics of simply supported and two-equal-span continuous skew composite concrete slab on compact steel girder bridges. Detailed parametric studies were conducted to find the effect of several parameters upon the load distribution characteristics in <b>skew</b> <b>bridges</b> {{at different stages of}} loading. In this work, both the nonlinear finite element method and the yield-line theory were employed in the theoretical analyses. The finite element method was used to study the behaviour and response of <b>skew</b> composite <b>bridges</b> in the elastic and post-elastic ranges of loading. The nonlinear finite element analysis was also used to conduct a parametric study and to evaluate the ultimate-load capacity of <b>skew</b> <b>bridges.</b> Moreover, the analysis through yield-line theory was utilized to yield different general formulae to predict the failure load of <b>skew</b> composite <b>bridges.</b> The most probable failure patterns were based on both the experimental and parametric studies. Five small-scale models of four-girder and five-girder <b>skew</b> composite <b>bridges</b> were constructed and tested to failure in order to verify the analytical approaches and to study the load distribution characteristics of <b>skew</b> <b>bridges</b> with varying parameters. The tested models were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of three simply supported single span <b>skew</b> composite <b>bridge</b> models with an angle of skew of 45 ∘ while the second group consisted of two two-equal-span continuous <b>skew</b> composite <b>bridge</b> models with the same angle of skew as the first group. Good comparisons between the theoretical and experimental results for all five models were shown. The analysis of the results from the parametric study revealed that the ultimate-load capacity and the load distribution characteristics of <b>skew</b> composite <b>bridges</b> are influenced by several factors such as: angle of skew, aspect ratio of the bridge, load position, type of interconnection of different elements of the bridge, continuity, presence of transverse diaphragms, and the sectional moment capacities.

Two-dimensional analysis {{is the only}} way to analyze prestressed bridges and members because otherwise the hand calculations are extremely difficult. <b>Skewed</b> <b>bridges,</b> however, need to be analyzed and designed three-dimensionally. Based on engineering inspection, it is possible to tell how a non-skewed symmetric bridge will behave. However, the knowledge of how a <b>skewed</b> <b>bridge</b> will behave cannot be obtained by inspection only. Finite element analysis can be used to model a bridge and discover how the bridge will react to dead loads and post-tensioning forces. When a bridge is built on a skew, the acute corners of the bridge support much less concrete weight than the obtuse corners of the bridge. If the post-tensioning force causes a decrease in load at the acute corners of the <b>skewed</b> <b>bridge</b> and if the <b>skew</b> of the <b>bridge</b> is great enough, there is a concern that there could be uplift at these acute corners of the bridge.
