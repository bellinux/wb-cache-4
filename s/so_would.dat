5|$|In January 1934, Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot {{announced}} that they had bombarded elements with alpha particles and induced radioactivity in them. By March, Fermi's assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. In March 1934, Fermi {{wanted to see if}} he could induce radioactivity with Rasetti's polonium-beryllium neutron source. Neutrons had no electric charge, and <b>so</b> <b>would</b> not be deflected by the positively charged nucleus. This meant that they needed much less energy to penetrate the nucleus than charged particles, and <b>so</b> <b>would</b> not require a particle accelerator, which the Via Panisperna boys did not have.|$|E
5|$|The British Indian Ocean Territory {{currently}} has no permanent population {{although there is}} a sizeable population who were born in the BIOT but currently live in Mauritius and the United Kingdom and <b>so</b> <b>would</b> be eligible to compete on birth criteria.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, the Allies {{spent the}} evening heatedly debating their course of action. The Peloponnesians were {{in favour of}} evacuating, {{and at this point}} Themistocles {{attempted}} his ruse with Xerxes. It was only when Aristides, the exiled Athenian general arrived that night, followed by some deserters from the Persians, with news of the deployment of the Persian fleet, that the Peloponnesians accepted that they could not escape, and <b>so</b> <b>would</b> fight.|$|E

Well, if <b>so,</b> he still <b>would</b> follow them. Perhaps her body was buried in the north. If <b>so,</b> he <b>would</b> be buried there also; perhaps her Soul dwelt in the north. If <b>so,</b> his soul <b>would</b> fly thither to join it. The Kaffirs would kill him in the pass. Well, if <b>so,</b> he <b>would</b> die with his face set northwards whither Rachel drew him.|$|R
5|$|Bednar has {{featured}} {{heavily in}} the Ex's public profile, and advocated for openness in communications. Food Building vendor Epic Burgers and Waffles' cronuts were tainted by Staphylococcus aureus toxin in 2013, a result of third party maple bacon jam. He advocated that the corporation discuss the issue directly and claimed doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> increase the fair's credibility with the public.|$|E
5|$|Gliding did {{not return}} to the Olympics after the war for two reasons: a {{shortage}} of gliders, and the failure to agree on a single model of competition glider. (Some in the community feared doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> hinder development of new designs.) The re-introduction of air sports such as gliding to the Olympics has occasionally been proposed by the world governing body, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), but has been rejected on the grounds of lack of public interest.|$|E
5|$|Photons mediate {{electromagnetic}} {{interactions between}} particles in quantum electrodynamics. An isolated electron {{at a constant}} velocity cannot emit or absorb a real photon; doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> violate conservation of energy and momentum. Instead, virtual photons can transfer momentum between two charged particles. This exchange of virtual photons, for example, generates the Coulomb force. Energy emission can occur when a moving electron is deflected by a charged particle, such as a proton. The acceleration of the electron results in the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation.|$|E
5000|$|For example, in the {{sentence}} [...] "Tode-s dua~dua le halin nahi-s deken", tode means lay, <b>so</b> tode-s <b>would</b> refer to laying multiple things, as the -s indicates plurality. Dua {{is the number}} two, <b>so</b> dua~dua <b>would</b> translate to the English [...] "pair" ...|$|R
50|$|For example, if multi-byte accesses must be 16 bit-aligned, {{addresses}} (given in bytes) at 0, 2, 4, 6, and <b>so</b> on <b>would</b> {{be considered}} aligned and therefore accessible, while addresses 1, 3, 5, and <b>so</b> on <b>would</b> be considered unaligned. Similarly, if multi-byte accesses must be 32-bit aligned, addresses 0, 4, 8, 12, and <b>so</b> on <b>would</b> be considered aligned and therefore accessible, and all addresses in between {{would be considered}} unaligned. Attempting to access a unit larger than a byte at an unaligned address can cause a bus error.|$|R
50|$|Motoko Kusanagi's {{body was}} {{designed}} by Masamune Shirow to be a mass production model <b>so</b> she <b>would</b> not be conspicuous. Her electrical and mechanical system within is special and features parts unavailable on the civilian market. Shirow intentionally chose this appearance <b>so</b> Motoko <b>would</b> not be harvested for those parts.|$|R
5|$|Richard John Charles Tomlinson (born 13 January 1963) is {{a former}} officer of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). He {{believes}} he was subject to unfair dismissal from MI6 in 1995, and attempted to take his former employer to a tribunal. MI6 refused, arguing that to do <b>so</b> <b>would</b> breach state security, although Tomlinson disputed this reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Under modern {{constitutional}} conventions, {{the sovereign}} acts {{on the advice}} of his or her ministers. Since these ministers most often enjoy the support of parliament and obtain the passage of bills, it is improbable that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent. Hence, in modern practice, royal assent is always granted; a refusal to do <b>so</b> <b>would</b> be appropriate only in an emergency requiring the use of the monarch's reserve powers.|$|E
5|$|William Herschel {{discovered}} {{the first two}} moons, Titania and Oberon, in 1787, {{and the other three}} ellipsoidal moons were discovered in 1851 by William Lassell (Ariel and Umbriel) and in 1948 by Gerard Kuiper (Miranda). These five have planetary mass, and <b>so</b> <b>would</b> be considered (dwarf) planets if they were in direct orbit about the Sun. The remaining moons were discovered after 1985, either during the Voyager 2 flyby mission or with the aid of advanced Earth-based telescopes.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, almost all design work was halted, although work on turrets and gunnery arrangements by Germaniawerft's designers continued until the German invasion of the Netherlands in May. The first 1047-class ship was scheduled to be completed in 1944, <b>so</b> <b>would</b> in any case have been too late to stop the Japanese advance into the Dutch East Indies. Due to the war, final plans for the ships were never completed, and the ships were never constructed.|$|E
5|$|A deal {{to upgrade}} {{several of the}} Chinooks was reached in May 1991. Under this arrangement, seven of the {{surviving}} CH-47Cs were sold to the US Army for $A40 million, the funds being used to partly {{cover the cost of}} upgrading the remaining four to CH-47D standard. The total cost of the project was $A62 million, of which $A42 million was required to upgrade the four helicopters and the remainder for spare parts, administration and new facilities for the Chinooks at Townsville. All eleven Chinooks were shipped to the United States in September 1993, and the upgraded helicopters returned to Australia in 1995. It was decided to transfer the Chinooks to the Australian Army, as by this time the RAAF no longer had significant expertise in operating the type and doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> concentrate all of the ADF's battlefield helicopters with the same service.|$|E
5|$|Advantages over {{conventional}} diesel equipment included increased availability, higher speed through curves, {{and decreased}} weight which caused less wear on the tracks. Impressed with their reliability, Amtrak purchased the trainsets and ordered another four trainsets, which entered service in 1975 on the Chicago–Milwaukee and Chicago–Detroit corridors. The purchase {{price for the}} six trainsets was $18 million. Amtrak contemplated ordering an additional 14 trainsets for the partially-electrified Northeast Corridor between Boston and New York City. Doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> have required a significant rise in fares between the two cities, and the United States Department of Transportation blocked the proposal.|$|E

5|$|Amompharetus: The {{leader of}} a {{battalion}} of Spartans, he refused to undertake the night-time retreat towards Plataea before the battle, since doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> be shameful for a Spartan. Herodotus has an angry debate continuing between Pausanias and Amompharetus until dawn, whereupon {{the rest of the}} Spartan army finally began to retreat, leaving Amompharetus' division behind. Not expecting this, Amompharetus eventually led his men after the retreating Spartans. However, another tradition remembers Amompharetus as winning great renown at Plataea, and it has thus been suggested that Amompharetus, far from being insubordinate, had instead volunteered to guard the rear.|$|E
5|$|At noon on May 6, 1955, Conant, {{along with}} the high commissioners from Britain and France, signed the {{documents}} ending Allied control of West Germany, admitting it to NATO, and allowing it to rearm. The office of the United States High Commissioner was abolished and Conant became instead the first United States Ambassador to West Germany. His role was now to encourage West Germany to build up its forces, while reassuring the Germans that doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> not result in a United States withdrawal. Being fluent in German, Conant {{was able to give}} speeches to German audiences. He paid numerous visits to German educational and scientific organizations.|$|E
5|$|Australia allows gay men {{and lesbians}} to serve openly. Openly gay and lesbian {{personnel}} were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this change at the time, and it caused considerable public debate. Opponents of lifting the ban on gay and lesbian personnel argued that doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> greatly harm the ADF's cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused relatively few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on gay service did not have any negative effects on the ADF's morale, effectiveness or recruitment and retention, and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments.|$|E

50|$|In 1978, Michael Gazzaniga and Joseph DeLoux {{discovered}} a unique phenomenon among split-brain {{patients who were}} asked to perform a simultaneous concept task. The patient was shown 2 pictures: of {{a house in the}} winter time and of a chicken’s claw. The pictures were positioned <b>so</b> they <b>would</b> exclusively be seen in only one visual field of the brain (the winter house was positioned <b>so</b> it <b>would</b> only be seen in the patient’s left visual field (LVF), which corresponds to the brain’s right hemisphere, and the chicken’s claw was placed <b>so</b> it <b>would</b> only be seen in the patient’s right visual field (RVF), which corresponds to the brain’s left hemisphere.|$|R

5|$|By 1980, the {{authorities}} {{had no choice}} but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic levels, but they knew that doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> likely spark another worker rebellion. Western bankers providing loans to the Polish government at a meeting at the Bank Handlowy in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that low prices of consumer goods could no longer be subsidized by the state. The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat. A wave of strikes and factory occupations began at once, with the biggest ones taking place in Lublin in July 1980.|$|E
5|$|By 19:30, the High Seas Fleet, {{which was}} {{by that point}} {{pursuing}} the British battlecruisers, had not yet encountered the Grand Fleet. Scheer had been considering retiring his forces before darkness exposed his ships to torpedo boat attack. He had not yet made a decision when his leading battleships encountered {{the main body of}} the Grand Fleet. This development made it impossible for Scheer to retreat, for doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> have sacrificed the slower pre-dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron, while using his dreadnoughts and battlecruisers to cover their retreat would have subjected his strongest ships to overwhelming British fire. Instead, Scheer ordered his ships to turn 16 points to starboard, which would bring the pre-dreadnoughts to the relative safety of the disengaged side of the German battle line.|$|E
5|$|Flying at {{low level}} {{provided}} protection against fighters as well. Radars {{of the era}} {{did not have the}} ability to look down; if the radar were aimed down to detect targets at a lower altitude, the reflection of the ground would overwhelm the signal returned from a target. An interceptor flying at normal altitudes would be effectively blind to bombers far below it. The interceptor could descend to lower altitudes {{to increase the amount of}} visible sky, but doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> limit its radar range in the same way as the missile sites, as well as greatly increasing fuel use and thus reducing mission time. The Soviet Union would not introduce an interceptor with look-down capability until 1972 with the High Lark radar, and even this model had very limited capability.|$|E
