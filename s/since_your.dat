25|$|Sir, I {{have the}} honor of informing you that I have arrived in this port with a {{commission}} from the Supreme Government of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata to take possession of these islands {{on behalf of the}} country to which they belong by Natural Law. While carrying out this mission I want to do so with all the courtesy and respect all friendly nations; one of the objectives of my mission is to prevent the destruction of resources necessary for all ships passing by and forced to cast anchor here, as well as to help them to obtain the necessary supplies, with minimum expenses and inconvenience. <b>Since</b> <b>your</b> presence here is not in competition with these purposes and in the belief that a personal meeting will be fruitful for both of us, I invite you to come aboard, where you'll be welcomed to stay as long as you wish; I would also greatly appreciate your extending this invitation to any other British subject found in the vicinity; I am, respectfully yours. Signed, Jewett, Colonel of the Navy of the United Provinces of South America and commander of the frigate Heroína.|$|E

500|$|Jeff Gerstmann, {{co-founder of}} Giant Bomb, felt that while Forza Motorsport 4 was a [...] "fantastic driving game" [...] it merely {{felt like an}} {{incremental}} improvement on its predecessor. [...] "I found myself getting a very 'annual sports game update' vibe off of it," [...] stated Gerstmann. Justin Calvert of GameSpot agreed; he said that Forza Motorsport 4 refines upon its predecessor, [...] "but also feels {{just a little too}} familiar". X-Plays Jason D'Aprile also felt that Forza Motorsport 4 an improvement over Forza Motorsport 3, [...] "making it the absolute king of the road." [...] He cited the game's audio and visuals, the number of cars and tracks, the online play and variable skill level all as high points. However, D'Aprile felt that the Kinect implementation was [...] "a gimmick" [...] and expressed disappointment that there was not more content involving Top Gear. Matthew Kato, reviewer for Game Informer, was unimpressed by Forzas Kinect integration as well. He felt that Kinect-based racing [...] "isn’t satisfying <b>since</b> <b>your</b> arms get tired and the game controls the gas and brake for you." ...|$|E
500|$|Work on the game's storyline {{and levels}} began in January 1993. Jones {{recalled}} that starting from cliché plots they moved towards [...] "very interesting and unique but {{extremely difficult to}} understand stories". One of the more complicated stories cast the player {{as one of a}} group of Roman soldiers who discovered a mountain spring that extended their lives. Every seven years one soldier would be picked to descend into the caves and bring back more water. If the leader died, a new one would be selected to undertake the journey to ensure their survival. [...] "It was a very interesting plot <b>since</b> <b>your</b> quest wasn't necessarily virtuous, it didn't involve doing good things or saving the world," [...] Jones said. [...] "It was just you were chosen, more or less against your will, to become the next leader of this freak cult of immortals." [...] The final plot occupied a middle ground between the simple and complex stories, because the developers did not want to force players to become deeply involved in the story.|$|E
500|$|A common {{concern was}} that it was simply too {{vulnerable}} in traffic. Your Computer commented that [...] "a periscope would be handy if you intended driving the C5 on busy roads <b>since</b> <b>your</b> head is only at bonnet level." [...] The Guardian's motoring correspondent wrote of her [...] "grave misgivings about its use in congested traffic... On a sharp turn it too easily lifts a rear wheel, is hazardously silent, and low down. It disappears below a car driver's sight-line when pulling up alongside. The prospect of these vehicles merging into heavy traffic, dwarfed by heavy lorries, buses, and cars, is worrying. Their low speed risks turning them into mobile chicanes for other traffic." [...] Another Guardian writer wrote that he [...] "would not want to drive [...] C5 in any traffic at all. My head was on a level with the top of a juggernaut's tyres, the exhaust fumes blasted into my face. Even with the minuscule front and rear lights on, I could not feel confident that a lorry driver so high above the ground would see me." [...] Sinclair issued a publicity photograph showing the C5's industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, in a C5 alongside a cardboard cutout of an Austin Mini to illustrate that the C5 driver's seated position was actually higher than that of a Mini driver.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the deaths}} {{of his wife and}} daughters, Thomas Cromwell was devoted to his son, Gregory, and his sister Catherine's son, Richard Williams (alias Cromwell) and they were a close family. One of Richard's letters to his uncle bemoaned their {{separation}} from one another. He wrote that [...] "I never more desired anything, than <b>since</b> <b>your</b> departure, to see you, nor thought time longer in your absence." [...] Gregory was equally effusive in a letter where he asked only for his father's blessing, which he described as [...] "more treasure unto me then all the abundance of worldly goods." [...] Gregory remained close to his father and looked up to his older cousin, Richard Cromwell, who had distinguished himself by his military skill and gallantry. Richard Cromwell adopted his uncle Thomas Cromwell's surname when he was made a Privy Councillor in 1531. Richard must have been fond of Gregory, leaving him [...] "a great horse" [...] in his will.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, the twenty-fifth {{anniversary of}} Powell's [...] "Rivers of Blood" [...] speech, Powell {{wrote an article}} for The Times, in which he claimed the {{concentration}} of immigrant communities in inner cities would lead to [...] "communalism", which would have grave effects on the electoral system: [...] "communalism and democracy, as the experience of India demonstrates, are incompatible". In May, he spoke for Alan Sked of the Anti-Federalist League (the forerunner of the United Kingdom Independence Party) who {{was standing at the}} Newbury by-election. Sked went on to lose his deposit at the by-election, polling only 601 votes (1.0%). At Michael Portillo's fortieth birthday party the same month, Thatcher greeted him enthusiastically and asked him: [...] "Enoch, I haven't seen you <b>since</b> <b>your</b> eightieth-birthday dinner. How are you?" [...] Powell replied, [...] "I'm eighty-one". Powell's opinion of Thatcher had declined after she endorsed John Major at the 1992 general election, which he believed to be a repudiation of her fight against European integration after the Bruges speech.|$|E

Disappointed by the reception of his work in mathematical circles, Grassmann lost his contacts with mathematicians as well as his interest in geometry. The last years of his life he turned to historical linguistics and the study of Sanskrit. He wrote books on German grammar, collected folk songs, and learned Sanskrit. He wrote a 2,000-page dictionary and a translation of the Rigveda (more than 1,000 pages) which earned him a membership of the American Orientalists' Society. In modern ...|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara {{cited the}} Torah's {{requirement}} for corroborating witnesses {{to support the}} Mishnah's prohibition of circumstantial evidence in capital cases. The Mishnah reported that they admonished witnesses in capital cases not to testify based on conjecture (that is, circumstantial evidence) or hearsay, for the court would scrutinize the witnesses' evidence by cross-examination and inquiry..

It was taught in a Baraita that Rabbi Simeon ben Shetach said that he once did see a man pursuing his fellow into a ruin, and when Rabbi Simeon ben Shetach ran after the man and saw him, bloody sword in hand and the murdered man writhing, Rabbi Simeon ben Shetach exclaimed to the man, [...] "Wicked man, who slew this man?

2500|$|During the Reconstruction Era, in 1870, former slave James Webster Smith, {{through private}} sponsorship, {{became the first}} African American cadet to enroll at West Point. Smith, however, was {{immediately}} and severely hazed by white cadets. It is believed that the Academy's military establishment was determined to force Smith out. One of Belknap's nephews, a cadet at the Academy, had been reprimanded (but not otherwise punished) for hazing Smith. In one instance, Smith was arrested and taken to a military court for fighting a white cadet. However, Major General Oliver O. Howard, an advocate for African American civil rights and {{in charge of the}} trial, acquitted Smith of all charges and gave him a light punishment for unruly conduct. This outraged the Academy's Bureau of Military Justice, who made a formal protest to Belknap on November 20, 1870. In a second instance in January 1871, Smith was arrested again for not holding his head up when marching, after being severely harassed by white cadets. This time Smith was convicted and his case was appealed to [...] Belknap. Smith was recommended for expulsion, but Belknap intervened with President Grant, who changed the sentence to setting Smith back one academic year, which caused him to repeat his Plebe year. Smith continued at West Point until 1874, when Professor Peter S. Michie, a white supremacist, gave Smith a private test, in defiance of traditional West Point practice. Smith was forced out of West Point after having supposedly failed the test and being denied a chance to retest. Belknap concurred when Major General Thomas H. Ruger, appointed Superintendent of West Point in 1871, reduced the amount of hazing of cadets by 1873 and made strong efforts to eradicate the [...] "discreditable" [...] practice. Belknap admired Ruger's performance as West Point Superintendent and stated, [...] "I am pretty satisfied with the success of your management, and private conversations with officers of all grades, & with civilians too, who have been there <b>since</b> <b>your</b> accession..." [...] Other African Americans followed Smith's entrance into West Point and Henry O. Flipper became the first to graduate from the Academy in 1877. In 1997, President Bill Clinton attempted to acknowledge and right the wrong done to Smith by awarding him a posthumous commission as a second lieutenant.|$|E
