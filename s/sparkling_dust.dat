60|$|For a {{long time}} after the course of the steamer Sofala had been altered for the land, the low swampy coast had {{retained}} its appearance of a mere smudge of darkness beyond a belt of glitter. The sunrays seemed to fall violently upon the calm sea--seemed to shatter themselves upon an adamantine surface into <b>sparkling</b> <b>dust,</b> into a dazzling vapor of light that blinded the eye and wearied the brain with its unsteady brightness.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2004 {{the film}} was re-released on DVD Tales of Wonder Music and Animation Classics (also called Paul McCartney - Music & Animation Collection), to mark its 20th Anniversary, along with two other shorts {{directed}} by Geoff Dunbar, Tropic Island Hum and Tuesday. This version contains an alternative opening, which begins in an old bedroom filled with Rupert merchandise. We see Paul McCartney opening a large chest and digging through old dusty books until he comes upon an old Rupert book. He takes {{it out of the}} chest, blows on it, and <b>sparkling</b> <b>dust</b> flies away from the book. McCartney opens the book to reveal his childhood house address, a possible reference to the VHS covers of this film. The page then turns to the title card. The print of this version is also matted, cropping {{the top and bottom of}} the image to an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 widescreen, which was how {{the film was}} exhibited theatrically. The opening for this edition was previously used at the start of a music video for the song [...] "We All Stand Together".|$|E

"Self-willed, strong-minded, humorous, generous {{of spirit}} and, {{for all his}} fame as down to earth as the folk who once adorned the {{terraces}} {{in the hope of}} seeing him <b>sparkle</b> gold <b>dust</b> on to their harsh working lives." [...] Les Scott describing Matthews' personality in the epilogue to his autobiography.|$|R
60|$|How {{all things}} <b>sparkle,</b> The <b>dust</b> is alive, To the birth they arrive: I snuff {{the breath of}} my morning afar, I see the pale lustres {{condense}} to a star: The fading colors fix, The vanishing are seen, And the world that shall be Twins {{the world that has}} been. I know the appointed hour, I greet my office well, Never faster, never slower Revolves the fatal wheel! The Fairest enchants me, The Mighty commands me, Saying, 'Stand in thy place; Up and eastward turn thy face; As mountains for the morning wait, Coming early, coming late, So thou attend the enriching Fate Which none can stay, and none accelerate. I am neither faint nor weary, Fill thy will, O faultless heart! Here from youth to age I tarry,-- Count it flight of bird or dart. My heart at the heart of things Heeds no longer lapse of time, Rushing ages moult their wings, Bathing in thy day sublime.|$|R
60|$|As for Sihamba Jan {{wished to}} send her away, but Suzanne, who had grown fond of her, begged {{him that he would}} not do so, at least until he had spoken with her. So he ordered one of the slaves to fetch her, and {{presently}} the little woman came, and having saluted him, sat herself down {{on the floor of the}} sitting room after the Kaffir fashion. She was a strange little creature to see in her fur kaross and bead broidered girdle, but for a native she was very clean and pretty, with her wise woman's face set upon a body that had it been less rounded might almost have been that of a child. Also she had adorned herself with great care, not in the cast-off clothes of white people but after her own manner, for her wavy hair which stood out from her head was powdered over with that <b>sparkling</b> blue <b>dust</b> which the Kaffir women use, and round her neck she wore a single string of large blue beads.|$|R
