Sisal co-products and residues are identified and quantified; Environmental and socio-economic indicators are applied. Energy potential and bioproducts from sisal in Brazil have been studied in universities and research centers, but not sufficiently quantified, so the scientific bases for this purpose are still limited. Considering an annual sisal fiber production in Brazil at 100, 000 MT, and a 4 % yield from the fiber extraction process, an estimated 2. 4 million metric tons of products are thus generated by the defibering process, consisting of pulp, <b>sisal</b> <b>tow,</b> and juice. Furthermore, an estimated 900, 000 metric tons per year of residual biomass from the stems {{at the end of the}} 10 -year productive cycle is produced and presently left to rot in the field...|$|E
