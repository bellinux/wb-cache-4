5|$|A concave line of {{abrasion}} {{and polishing}} {{can be found}} on both one of the central kerb-stones on the western end of the monument and a kerb-stone on the south-east of the monument. These have been attributed to the <b>sharpening</b> of flint and other stone axe-blades on these sarsens. It is possible that these tools were sharpened for use in cutting and carving the timber levers and struts which would have been used in erecting the stones and constructing the tomb. Similar evidence for the <b>sharpening</b> of tools has been found at West Kennet Long Barrow, as well as later prehistoric monuments such as Stonehenge.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{the early}} {{occupation}} of Ditton is scant. A Mesolithic tranchet axe, a <b>sharpening</b> flake, three microliths and 36 blades were found at Ditton, but the exact site of the find is now unknown. Mesolithic flint implements, Iron Age pottery and pit dwellings have also {{been reported in the}} Holt Hill area of Ditton.|$|E
5|$|Irving's {{writings}} on Columbus are {{a mixture of}} history and fiction, a genre now called romantic history. Irving based them on extensive research in the Spanish archives, but also added imaginative elements aimed at <b>sharpening</b> the story. The first of these works {{is the source of}} the durable myth that medieval Europeans believed the Earth was flat. (See Myth of the flat earth.) According to the popular book, Columbus proved the Earth was round.|$|E

5|$|Unlike a teacher-student relationship, {{in which}} the student memorizes and repeats the {{material}} back in tests, chavrusa-style learning puts each student {{in the position of}} analyzing the text, organizing his thoughts into logical arguments, explaining his reasoning to his partner, hearing out his partner's reasoning, and questioning and <b>sharpening</b> each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights into the meaning of the text.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, <b>sharpening</b> the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E
5|$|The {{artefacts}} recovered include {{fragments of}} pottery, charcoal, bone and a whetstone (a stone for <b>sharpening</b> blades). Later, on excavation, spinning whorls and weaving combs were found, suggesting textile production, although {{this may have}} been for domestic use rather than industry. Evidence of bronze-casting and iron-smelting were found. Fine jewellery made from bronze bone have also been found showing a high degree of craftsmanship. Files and hammer heads were examined by metallography which showed that carbon compositions were found to be generally low. In 1905 an early British tin coin was discovered, believed to be from the 1st century A.D, which was sent to the British Museum. Various other objects from the excavation are also help by the British Museum.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a double <b>sharpened</b> CIC decimation filter, {{which consists of}} generalized comb filter as first stage, <b>sharpened</b> comb filter as second and third stage. The comb decimation filter at the first stage operates at the input sampling rate, <b>sharpened</b> second stage operates at lower sampling rate as compared to first stage and <b>sharpened</b> third stage operates at lower than {{the first and second}} stages. This reduces the sampling at every stage of the three stage CIC decimation filter. The <b>sharpened</b> second stage produces the narrow passband droop and better stop band alias rejection. This narrow passband droop will be compensated with the help of third stage which is <b>sharpened</b> section. This filter structure is designed in MATLAB Simulink environment and implemented with help of Virtex-V XC 5 VLX 110 T- 3 ff 1136. Device utilization and simulation results are tabulated...|$|R
50|$|Threshold {{controls}} the minimum brightness change {{that will be}} <b>sharpened</b> or how far apart adjacent tonal values have to be before the filter does anything. This lack of action is important to prevent smooth areas from becoming speckled. The threshold setting {{can be used to}} <b>sharpen</b> more-pronounced edges, while leaving subtler edges untouched. Low values should <b>sharpen</b> more because fewer areas are excluded. Higher threshold values exclude areas of lower contrast.|$|R

5|$|Much of this {{acceptance}} {{has been}} based on the erroneous assumption that the canines are grooved instead of ridged; grooved canines in Euchambersia would parallel the fangs of various venomous snakes as well as the venom-delivering incisors of the living solenodons. This interpretation, which has consistently appeared in literature published after 1986, was determined by Julien Benoit {{to be the result of}} the propagation of Broom's overly reconstructed diagram of the skull, without the context of the actual specimens. This line of evidence has been raised to support the necessity of a re-evaluation the hypothesis of a venomous bite in Euchambersia. Additionally, Benoit argued that grooved and ridged canines are not necessarily associated with venomous animals either, as shown by their presence in hippopotami, muntjacs, and baboons, in which they play a role in grooming or <b>sharpening</b> the teeth; in the latter two, ridged canines are also accompanied by a distinct fossa in front of the eye, which is entirely unconnected with venom. Furthermore, grooved and ridged teeth in non-venomous snakes are used to reduce suctional drag when capturing slippery prey like fish or invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain {{in a way that was}} beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of <b>sharpening</b> the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Gawain {{leaves for}} the Green Chapel with the girdle wound twice around his waist. He finds the Green Knight <b>sharpening</b> an axe and, as promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing Gawain flinches {{slightly}} and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain doesn’t flinch {{with the second}} swing; but again the Green Knight withholds {{the full force of}} his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily Gawain tells him to deliver his blow and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck. The game is over. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was a trick of the 'elderly lady' Gawain saw at the castle, who is actually the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Arthur's sister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death. Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully but the Green Knight laughs and professes him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the girdle as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The Knights of the Round Table absolve him of blame and decide that henceforth that they will wear a green sash in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as a reminder to be always honest.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} whether cone beam CT (CBCT) enhancement filters influence {{the diagnosis of}} longitudinal root fractures. Methods: 40 extracted human posterior teeth were endodontically prepared, and fractures with no separation of fragments were made in 20 teeth of this sample. The teeth were placed in a dry mandible and scanned using a Classic i-CAT (R) CBCT device (Imaging Sciences International, Inc., Hatfield, PA). Evaluations were performed with and without CBCT filters (<b>Sharpen</b> Mild, <b>Sharpen</b> Super Mild, S 9, <b>Sharpen,</b> <b>Sharpen</b> 3 x 3, Angio <b>Sharpen</b> Medium 5 x 5, Angio <b>Sharpen</b> High 5 x 5 and Shadow 3 x 3) by three oral radiologists. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was calculated by the kappa test. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were determined. McNemar test was applied for agreement between all images vs the gold standard and original images vs images with filters (p 0. 05). Conclusions: Although no statistical differences was observed in the diagnosis of root fractures when using filters, these filters seem to improve diagnostic capacity for longitudinal root fractures. Further in vitro studies with endodontic-treated teeth and research in vivo should be considered...|$|R
30|$|Previous to SVM training, it {{is crucial}} to preprocess each image where this {{procedure}} involves histogram equalization, filtering using a median filter, followed by the <b>sharpen</b> filter.

25|$|The {{geometry}} and <b>sharpening</b> of the cutting edges {{is crucial to}} the performance of the bit. Small bits that become blunt are often discarded because <b>sharpening</b> them correctly is difficult and they are cheap to replace. For larger bits, special grinding jigs are available. A special tool grinder is available for <b>sharpening</b> or reshaping cutting surfaces on twist drill bits in order to optimize the bit for a particular material.|$|E
25|$|There is {{support for}} several methods of <b>sharpening</b> and {{blurring}} images, including the blur and sharpen tool. The unsharp mask tool {{is used to}} sharpen an image selectively— it only sharpens areas of an image that are sufficiently detailed. The Unsharp Mask tool is considered to give more targeted results for photographs than a normal <b>sharpening</b> filter. The Selective Gaussian Blur tool works in a similar way, except it blurs areas of an image with little detail.|$|E
