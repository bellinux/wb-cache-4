50|$|The AFC {{is placed}} in front of the powered roof supports, and the {{shearing}} action of the rotating drums cutting into the coal seam disintegrates the coal, this being loaded onto the AFC. The coal is removed from the coal face by a <b>scraper</b> <b>chain</b> <b>conveyor</b> to the main gate. Here it is loaded onto a network of conveyor belts for transport to the surface. At the main gate the coal is usually reduced in size in a crusher, and loaded onto the first conveyor belt by the beam stage loader (BSL).|$|E
40|$|The {{safety of}} coal ploughs {{was to be}} {{enhanced}} by reducing servicing and repair operations, which are carried out in critical working areas, in cramped conditions and with poor visibility and insecure footing. Based on the experience so fara with pretensioning systems for <b>scraper</b> <b>chain</b> <b>conveyors,</b> new systems for coal ploughs were constructed and tested. Failures like chain rupture followed by crash situations can be prevented by constant monitoring and optimised control of the plough chain tension. This will also help to prevent secondary damage which requires long repair times. Optimal pretensioning will also prolong the life of chains and other components by reducing power, vibrations and wear.

40|$|The basic {{behavior}} of mining crushed goods in <b>chain</b> <b>scraper</b> <b>conveyors</b> was examined using a special test stand. The characteristics resistance {{lines of the}} upper end-piece were determined for conveyor idle {{as a function of}} the determinative crushed good characteristics (granular structure, moisture content, type of goods) on the size of the conveyor load, on the conveyor construction and on the stopped time of the conveyor. Crushed goods with a narrow granular profile and sphere-like grains caused about 35 % greater resistance than fine coal and raw coal with broad granular profile. For goods containing water more than 10 % by weight, the solids friction retreated in favor of flow friction. The coefficient of resistance decreased considerably in the range of lower speeds and then increased with increasing conveyor speed. The conveyance of sandstone ore required about 280 % greater specific drive than the conveyance of raw coal. Resistance coefficients for coal and raw coal showed no dependence on the design of the conveyor. Start-up of loaded conveyors after longer stop times was simulated and the specific break-loose force was determined...|$|R
