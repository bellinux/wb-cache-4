40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} transformation of Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. <b>sepedonicus,</b> the {{potato ring rot}} bacterium, with plasmid vectors. Three of the plasmids used, pDM 100, pDM 302, and pDM 306, contain the origin of replication from pCM 1, a native plasmid of C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis. We constructed two new cloning vectors, pHN 205 and pHN 216, by using the origin of replication of pCM 2, another native plasmid of C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis. Plasmids pDM 302, pHN 205, and pHN 216 were stably maintained without antibiotic selection in various strains of C. michiganensis subsp. <b>sepedonicus.</b> We observed that for a single plasmid, different strains of C. michiganensis subsp. <b>sepedonicus</b> showed significantly different transformation efficiencies. We also found unexplained strain-to-strain differences in stability with various plasmid constructions containing different arrangements of antibiotic resistance genes and origins of replication.

The best transformation efficiencies were obtained when C. michiganensis subsp. <b>sepedonicus</b> cells were grown on DM agar plates, harvested during the early exponential growth phase, and used fresh (without freezing) for electroporation.

Stem and petiole samples from susceptible and tolerant cultivars (Russet Burbank and Belrus, respectively), inoculated with 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7. 2) or 102 or 109 cfu of either an aggressive or a less aggressive C. m. <b>sepedonicus</b> strain, were processed by directly blotting cut tissue sections on nylon membranes, macerating frozen tissues, and applying xylem fluid collected by centrifugation to nylon membranes (stems only).

40|$|Molecular {{biological}} {{studies on}} Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. <b>sepedonicus,</b> the causal agent of {{bacterial ring rot}} of potato, have gained greater feasibility due to the recent availability of whole genomic sequences and genetic tools for related taxa. Here, we describe the first report of construction and characterization of a transposon (Tn) mutant library of C. michiganensis subsp. <b>sepedonicus</b> sp. strain R 10. Since virulence of R 10 in potato has been shown previously {{to be associated with}} elicitation of a nonhost hypersensitive response (HR), the mutant library was screened initially for loss of HR in tobacco. The screen identified two HR-negative mutants containing Tn insertions within the same gene, CMS 2989 (chp- 7), although at distinct locations. chp- 7 is one of 11 pat- 1 homologs in C. michiganensis subsp. <b>sepedonicus.</b> HR-negative mutants of R 10 multiplied to the same extent as wild type in planta but were less virulent in potato.

40|$|Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. <b>sepedonicus</b> is a plant-pathogenic {{bacterium}} and the causative {{agent of}} bacterial ring rot, a devastating agricultural disease under strict quarantine control and zero tolerance in the seed potato industry. This organism {{appears to be}} largely restricted to an endophytic lifestyle, proliferating within plant tissues and unable to persist {{in the absence of}} plant material. Analysis of the genome sequence of C. michiganensis subsp. <b>sepedonicus</b> and comparison with the genome sequences of related plant pathogens revealed a dramatic recent evolutionary history. The genome contains 106 insertion sequence elements, which appear to have been active in extensive rearrangement of the chromosome compared to that of Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis. There are 110 pseudogenes with overrepresentation in functions associated with carbohydrate metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and pathogenicity. Genome comparisons also indicated that there is substantial gene content diversity within the species, probably due to differential gene acquisition and loss. These genomic features and evolutionary dating suggest that there was recent adaptation for life in a restricted niche where nutrient diversity and perhaps competition are low, correlated with a reduced ability to exploit previously occupied complex niches outside the plant. Toleration of factors such as multiplication and integration of insertion sequence elements, genome rearrangements, and functional disruption of many genes and operons seems to indicate that there has been general relaxation of selective pressure on {{a large proportion of the}} genome...|$|E

Both proteins exhibited strong antibacterial activity against the phytopathogenic bacterium Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. <b>sepedonicus</b> (50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) 1. 5 – 8 lM) and antifungal activity against the phytopathogenic fungi Colletotrichum coccoides and Botrytis cinerea (IC 50 5 – 14 lM).

40|$|The {{quarantine}} bacterium Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. <b>sepedonicus</b> (Cms) causes bacterial {{ring rot}} (BRR) in potato but is difficult to detect, hampering the diagnosis of this disease. ELISA immunoassays have not been widely used to detect Cms because commercially available anti-Cms antibodies detect mainly EPS-producing bacteria and can fail to detect strains that do not produce EPS. In the current study, we developed {{a new type of}} polyclonal antibody that specifically detects Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. <b>sepedonicus</b> bacteria irrespective of their EPS level. We first found that the presence of bacterial EPS precluded quantitative measurement of bacteria by currently available immunoenzymatic methods, but that washing Cms cells with acidic and basic buffers to remove EPS before analysis successfully standardized ELISA results. We used a mix of three strains of Cms with diverse EPS levels to generate antigen for production of antibodies recognizing Cms cells with and without an EPS layer (IgG-EPS and IgG-N-EPS, respectively). The resulting IgG-N-EPS recognized almost all Cms strains tested in this work regardless of their mucoidal level. The availability of this new antibody renders immunological diagnostics of Cms more sensitive and reliable, as our newly developed antibodies can be used in many type of immunoassays.

As the agents feasible for use in this purpose, we examined the selenium nanocomposites obtained from the macrobasidiomycetes' submerged cultures. For exploring the bionanocomposites effect on Cms, the methods of agar well diffusion, the suspension turbidity measurement, and the colony-forming units count were applied.

The suppression action of nanocompostes was elucidated by means of both agar well diffusion assay and colony-forming units count. Thus, the results obtained demonstrate the occurrence of bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of the substances under study, and favor the supposition on advisability of further research into the selenium nanocomposites as the agents for agricultural recovery from the bacterial pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Two {{homogeneous}} proteins {{active in}} vitro against the bacterial pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. <b>sepedonicus</b> {{were obtained from}} a crude cell-wall preparation from the leaves of Columbia wild-type Arabidopsis. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of these proteins allowed their identification as lipid transfer proteins (LTP-a 1, LTP-a 2); the LTP 1 -a 1 sequence was identical to that deduced from a previously described cDNA (EMBL M 80566) and LTP-a 2 was quite divergent (44 % identical positions). These proteins were not detected in the cytoplasmic fraction by Western-blot analysis. Proteins LTP-s 1 and LTP-s 2 were similarly obtained from spinach leaves; LTP-s 1 was 91 % identical to a previously purified spinach LTP (Swiss Prot P 10976), and LTP-s 2 was moderately divergent (71 % identical positions). About of the total LTPs were detected in the cytoplasmic fraction from spinach by Westem-blot analysis. Concentrations of these proteins causing 50 % inhibition (EC- 50) were in the 0. 1 – 1 μM range for the bacterial pathogens C. michiganensis and Pseudomonas solanacearum and close to 10 μM for the fungal pathogen Fusarium solani...|$|E
