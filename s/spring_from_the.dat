5|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} principles <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> basic idea {{of the rule of}} law. These may be divided into two groups: principles that ensure the law is capable of guiding its subjects' behaviour, and principles establishing legal machinery to secure compliance with the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|Fragments 2 and 3, giving {{accounts}} of Jesus' baptism and temptation or transfiguration, <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> widespread Greco-Roman {{myth of the}} descent of divine Wisdom; this underlies the parallel passages in the gospels of Matthew(11.25–30), Luke(7.18–35 and 11.49–51) and John(1.1–18), {{as well as the}} Gospel of Thomas. The differences between fragment 3 and the orthodox canonical gospels are considerable: their third-person narrative has become an account by Jesus himself, Satan is replaced by the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is identified as Jesus' mother.|$|E
5|$|The thorax, which {{develops}} from segments 2, 3 and 4 of the larva, {{consists of}} three invisibly divided segments, namely prothorax, metathorax and mesothorax. The organs of insect locomotion – the legs and wings – are borne on the thorax. The forelegs <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> prothorax, the forewings and middle pair of legs are borne on the mesothorax, and the hindwings and hindlegs arise from the metathorax. In some cases, the wings are vestigial.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} smaller {{architectural}} works within cathedrals {{which have the}} curvilinear tracery. These include the arcading in the Lady Chapel at Ely, which also has the widest vault in England, the pulpitum screen at Lincoln and richly decorated doorways at Ely and Rochester. Characteristic of this period of Gothic is elaborate lierne vaulting in which the main ribs are connected by intermediate ribs which do not <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wall and so are not major structural members. The vaults of Bristol are the most famous examples of this style, which {{can also be seen}} at York.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong {{opposition}} to Silent <b>Spring</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> chemical industry. DuPont (a main manufacturer of DDT and 2,4-D) and Velsicol Chemical Company (exclusive manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor) were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin as well as The New Yorker and Audubon unless the planned Silent Spring features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process Silent Spring had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).|$|E
5|$|MD150 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US40 (Pulaski Highway) in East Baltimore. The route heads south as Haven Street, a four-lane undivided street that passes through an industrial area. East of the Highlandtown neighborhood, MD150 turns east onto Lombard Street, which crosses over three rail spurs that head south to Canton; one line splits from CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision, {{while the other}} two <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Amtrak Northeast Corridor and are operated by Norfolk Southern Railway. The state highway's run on Lombard Street ends at Ponca Street; Lombard Street continues east toward ramps to northbound I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) and Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. MD150 turns south onto Ponca Street, a four-lane divided highway that has a ramp to southbound I-895 toward the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel. The highway follows Ponca Street to the Greektown neighborhood, where MD150 turns east onto Eastern Avenue and immediately crosses over I-895.|$|E

5|$|Wilkins Peak is not gated, {{and it can}} {{be reached}} via an unpaved road known as Wilkins Peak Road that starts on U.S. Route 191 {{southwest}} of Rock Springs, Wyoming. The mountain can also be accessed via another unpaved road that begins in the Scott's Bottom Nature Area in Green River, Wyoming. The peak is accessible year-round, weather permitting. The Green River access road is in worse shape than the Rock Springs side, and it has several road hazards such as steep grades, poor grading, and off-road vehicle traffic. Along with serving radio needs, the peak also is a popular hiking and mountain biking location in the area. There are many smaller roads and trails that <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> peak that offer varied degrees of challenge.|$|E
5|$|The French grand {{plan called}} for two French armies to press against the flanks of the {{northern}} armies in the German states while a third army simultaneously approached Vienna through Italy. Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's army would push southeast from Düsseldorf, hopefully drawing troops and attention toward themselves, which would allow Moreau's army an easier crossing of the Rhine between Kehl and Hüningen. According to plan, Jourdan's army feinted toward Mannheim, and Charles quickly reapportioned his troops. Moreau's army attacked the bridgehead at Kehl, which was guarded by 7,000 imperial troops—troops recruited that <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Swabian circle polities, inexperienced and untrained—which amazingly held the bridgehead for several hours, but then retreated toward Rastatt. On June 23–24, Moreau reinforced the bridgehead with his forward guard. After pushing the imperial militia from their post on the bridgehead, his troops poured into Baden unhindered. Similarly, in the south, by Basel, Ferino's column moved speedily across the river and proceeded up the Rhine along the Swiss and German shoreline, toward Lake Constance and into {{the southern end of}} the Black Forest. Anxious that his supply lines would be overextended, Charles began a retreat to the east.|$|E
5|$|The French {{plan called}} for its two armies to press against the flanks of the Coalition's {{northern}} armies in the German states while simultaneously a third army approached Vienna through Italy. Specifically, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's army would push south from Düsseldorf, hopefully drawing troops and attention toward themselves, which would allow Moreau’s army an easier crossing of the Rhine and Huningen and Kehl. If all went according to plan, Jourdan’s army could feint toward Mannheim, which would force Charles to reapportion his troops. Once Charles moved the mass of his army to the north, Moreau’s army, which {{early in the year}} had been stationed by Speyer, would move swiftly south to Strasbourg. From there, they could cross the river at Kehl, which was guarded by 7,000-man inexperienced and lightly trained militia—troops recruited that <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Swabian circle polities. In the south, by Basel, Ferino’s column was to move speedily across the river and advanced up the Rhine along the Swiss and German shoreline, toward Lake Constance and spread into {{the southern end of the}} Black Forest. Ideally, this would encircle and trap Charles and his army as the left wing of Moreau's army swung behind him, and as Jourdan's force cut off his flank with Wartensleben's autonomous corps.|$|E

25|$|The Roman Catholic Church {{suffered}} persecution in Nazi Germany. As {{a totalitarian}} ideology, the Nazis claimed jurisdiction over all collective and social activity, interfering with Catholic schooling, youth groups, workers' clubs and cultural societies. Nazi ideology {{could not accept}} an autonomous establishment, whose legitimacy did not <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> government. It desired the subordination {{of the church to}} the state. The Nazi leadership hoped to dechristianise Germany in the long term.|$|E

25|$|Conversion, being a {{wrongful}} act, cannot <b>spring</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{exercise of}} a legal right.

The general rule {{is that there is}} no conversion until some act is done which is a denial or violation of the plaintiff's dominion over or rights in the property. To constitute a conversion of a chattel, there must be an unauthorized assumption of the right to possession or ownership. The act must have the essence of a tort.|$|E
