On that date Valdez ran over seventy-five yards of open terrain, under {{constant}} enemy fire, to aid a fallen Marine. He then moved the wounded man to a <b>safe</b> <b>area</b> and, quickly and competently, rendered medical assistance. Again exposing himself to enemy fire, Valdez moved across approximately fifty yards of open ground to another Marine. While treating the second Marine, he positioned himself between {{the man and the}} hostile fire. It was at this time that Valdez was mortally wounded by enemy small-arms fire.|$|E
5|$|On 10 and 11 April 1994, {{during the}} Bosnian War, the United Nations Protection Force called in air strikes {{to protect the}} Goražde <b>safe</b> <b>area,</b> {{resulting}} in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Goražde by two US F-16 jets acting under NATO direction. This resulted in the taking of 150U.N. personnel hostage on 14April. On 16April a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Goražde by Serb forces. A two-week NATO bombing campaign, Operation Deliberate Force, began in August 1995 against the Army of the Republika Srpska, after the Srebrenica massacre.|$|E

40|$|Are <b>safe</b> <b>areas</b> an {{effective}} option to protect civilian populations from mass atrocities {{when they are}} targeted by their own state? <b>Safe</b> <b>areas</b> disappeared from the international lexicon following the failures in Bosnia and Rwanda. But they are now receiving a second look {{as a way of}} responding to mass atrocities without full-scale military intervention. This article argues that the earlier generation of <b>safe</b> <b>areas</b> failed not due to their size or cost, but rather because of problems inherent with their underlying logic. <b>Safe</b> <b>areas</b> were based either on logics of consent or the presence of a credible military force. Hybrid <b>safe</b> <b>areas</b> (such as in Bosnia) were based on neither of these, but instead relied on the legitimacy inherent in the UN Security Council. Crucially, in cases where civilians were being directly targeted by belligerents, both hybrid and consent-based <b>safe</b> <b>areas</b> collapsed. This has direct ramifications for present discussions around the Protection of Civilians agenda and the Responsibility to Protect doctrine...|$|R

50|$|The {{establishment}} of the UN <b>Safe</b> <b>Areas</b> is considered today {{to be one of}} the most controversial decisions of the United Nations. The resolutions were unclear about the procedure by which these <b>safe</b> <b>areas</b> were to be protected in a war zone like Bosnia and Herzegovina. The resolution created a difficult diplomatic situation because the member states that voted in favor of it were, for political reasons, not willing to take the necessary steps to ensure the security of the <b>safe</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} a three-step method was adopted for evacuation planning. At {{the first step}} appropriate safe places for evacuation were identified and extracted using RS and image processing techniques.

In {{this research}}, {{in order to simplify}} the modeling, the Euclidian distance was utilized. At the third step, by considering and optimizing different factors (such as distance from <b>safe</b> <b>areas,</b> the capacity of the <b>safe</b> <b>areas,</b> and the population of the building blocks) optimum distribution of people to the <b>safe</b> <b>areas</b> was determined.

25|$|On 18 January 2010 Cvetković {{was arrested}} by the Israeli International Investigations Unit as he is {{suspected}} to {{have participated in the}} Srebrenica genocide. On 15 August 2013 Cvetković was extradited from Israel to Bosnia and Herzegovina to stand the trial on the charges of participation in Srebrenica genocide. The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina confirmed the indictment against Cvetković on 12 September 2013. He was accused that, {{as a member of the}} 10th Sabotage Detachment of the Main Staff of the Army of Republika Srpska, in late June 1995, he participated in the launch of the first attack on the UN <b>safe</b> <b>area</b> of Srebrenica and the UNPROFOR base with the aim to intimidate the Bosniak population, and that, on 11 July 1995, he participated in the military operation “Krivaja -95”, or the capture of the UN <b>safe</b> <b>area</b> of Srebrenica. He was also accused that, after the entry into Srebrenica, and after the entire Bosniak population had been expelled from the <b>safe</b> <b>area,</b> on 16 July 1995, at the Branjevo Farming Cooperative, together with other members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment, he fired form an automatic rifle at the detainees gathered in groups of ten men, on which occasion, at least nine hundred detained Bosniak men and young boys from the Srebrenica enclave were summarily executed, and only two detainees survived.|$|E

Henry Haslam served as MP during the Second World War and the five years of the Churchill Wartime Government. The veteran politician Sir Peter Tapsell was MP for the town from 1966 to 1983 and from 1997 to 2015, being Father of the House of Commons from 2010 to 2015. Following a redistribution of parliamentary constituencies, Edward Leigh was the MP from 1983 to 1997.|$|E

They asserted that when the last call finally identified Donegall Street as the site of the bomb, there wasn't enough time to clear the street. The Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade admitted responsibility for the bomb, which also injured 148 people, but claimed that the security forces had deliberately misrepresented the warnings in order to maximise the casualties.

25|$|People {{who are not}} {{registered}} {{players are}} not allowed to interfere with gameplay. Under the original rules, this includes spying on the other team, or helping players stay in a <b>safe</b> <b>area</b> by bringing them food or doing something for a player which would otherwise require them to leave a safe-zone. If a non-player is shot with a Nerf dart or attacked by a player in any way, they should report the player(s) involved if the incident was intentional. Players who attack non-players will be banned under most rules. The original rules, and most University custom rules, stress the importance of safety in the game. The rules stress the safety of the players and non-players by not allowing realistic looking weaponry, weaponry which could hurt on impact, or dangerous behavior during gameplay.|$|E
25|$|Adults of C. cadaverina {{lay their}} eggs in open wounds or natural body {{openings}} on carrion, typically in small clusters or scattered singly. The eggs usually hatch out within 24 to 72 hours depending on the season. The eggs will then hatch into larvae that will go through three instars (stages). Each one of these stages is separated by a molt. During a molt, the larvae shed its outer layer {{in order to accommodate}} for new growth that comes with increased consumption of food needed for energy stores. The first instar typically lasts for approximately 20 hours, while the second instar lasts for 16 hours followed by the third instar for 72 hours. After the larvae have completed their development and stored as much energy as possible, they disperse to a <b>safe</b> <b>area</b> to complete their next stage, the pupal stage. This stage lasts for about 9 days before the fly finally emerges as an adult. The total lifecycle of C. cadaverina can take anywhere from 17–19 days depending on the temperature.|$|E
