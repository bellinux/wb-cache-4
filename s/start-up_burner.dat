40|$|Fuel-cell-based {{auxiliary}} power units offer power generation with reduced fuel consumption and low emissions. A very promising {{system is the}} combination of an autothermal reformer with a high-temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cell. A fast start-up procedure is a crucial requirement {{for the use of}} this system as an {{auxiliary power}} unit. This paper reports on the development of a suitable start-up strategy for a 10 [*]kWel auxiliary power unit with a <b>start-up</b> <b>burner.</b> A commercially available diesel burner was tested as a start-up device. A dynamic MATLAB/Simulink model was developed to analyze different start-up strategies. With the currently available apparatus and <b>start-up</b> <b>burner</b> it takes 2, 260 [*]s before power generation can begin according to simulation results. The fuel processor alone would be ready for operation after 1, 000 [*]s. An optimization of the fuel cell stack with regard to its thermal mass would lead to a start-up time of 720 [*]s. A reduction to 600 [*]s is possible with a slight customization of the <b>start-up</b> <b>burner...</b>|$|E
40|$|This report {{discusses}} Test Campaign TC 12 of the Kellogg Brown & Root, Inc. (KBR) Transport Gasifier {{train with}} a Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation (SW) particle filter {{system at the}} Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF) located in Wilsonville, Alabama. The Transport Gasifier is an advanced circulating fluidized-bed reactor designed to operate as either a combustor or a gasifier using a particulate control device (PCD). While operating as a gasifier, either air or oxygen {{can be used as}} the oxidant. Test run TC 12 began on May 16, 2003, with the startup of the main air compressor and the lighting of the gasifier <b>start-up</b> <b>burner.</b> The Transport Gasifier operated until May 24, 2003, when a scheduled outage occurred to allow maintenance crews to install the fuel cell test unit and modify the gas clean-up system. On June 18, 2003, the test run resumed when operations relit the <b>start-up</b> <b>burner,</b> and testing continued until the scheduled end of the run on July 14, 2003. TC 12 had a total of 733 hours using Powder River Basin (PRB) subbituminous coal. Over the course of the entire test run, gasifier temperatures varied between 1, 675 and 1, 850 F at pressures from 130 to 210 psig...|$|E
40|$|Together {{with the}} {{high-temperature}} polymer electrolyte fuel cell, the reactor for the autothermal reforming (ATR) of liquid hydrocarbons, such as diesel fuel or kerosene, {{is the key}} component of the Jülich fuel cell system in the 5 kWe power class. This paper presents some of Jülich’s most recent development {{in the field of}} ATR reactors, specifically the ATR 12. ATR 12 is characterized by a new concept for the internal generation of superheated steam as one of the ATR reactants using concentric shells instead of coiled tubing and particularly by the integration of an electric heating wire to enable fast and autonomous start-up. Three different experimental procedures for heating up the ATR 12 are presented and discussed, the most suitable of which enables the start-up of the ATR 12 within approximately 15 min. As a consequence, from the system perspective, the bulky <b>start-up</b> <b>burner,</b> which is also difficult to control, along with the corresponding heat exchanger unit, can be dispensed with. Additionally, comprehensive steady-state experiments identify suitable reaction conditions for the operation of the ATR 12...|$|E

The Transport Gasifier is an advanced circulating fluidized-bed gasifier designed to operate as either a combustor or a gasifier in air- or oxygen-blown mode of operation using a particulate control device (PCD). Test run TC 11 began on April 7, 2003, with startup of the main air compressor and the lighting of the gasifier <b>start-up</b> <b>burner.</b> The Transport Gasifier operated until April 18, 2003, when a gasifier upset forced the termination of the test run. Over {{the course of the}} entire test run, gasifier temperatures varied between 1, 650 and 1, 800 F at pressures from 160 to 200 psig during air-blown operations and around 135 psig during enriched-air operations. Due to a restriction in the oxygen-fed lower mixing zone (LMZ), the majority of the test run featured air-blown operations...|$|E
40|$|The {{reforming}} of biomass-derived oxygenates such as ethanol or glycerol {{has been}} deeply studied. However, {{the stability of}} catalyst formulations developed for glycerol reforming was not {{the main focus of}} this development work to date. In the case of propylene glycol, few studies have been addressed to date. Propylene glycol serves as coolant in many mobile applications nowadays and therefore a distribution grid already exists. The practical processing of larger amounts of polyalcohols such as propylene glycol to synthesis gas for fuel cell applications in reactors larger than laboratory scale suited for distributed applications has not been adequately addressed to date. The current work deals with (a) the development of stable catalyst formulations for propylene glycol reforming and (b) reformer and fuel processor development for the steam reforming of propylene glycol in the power range exceeding 17 kWthermal of the synthesis gas product. A self developed stable catalyst formulation was incorporated into a plate heat-exchanger reformer. The energy required to drive the endothermic steam reforming reaction was foreseen to originate from the combustion of fuel cell anode off-gas and additional propylene glycol in a future technical process. Therefore the demonstrator was composed of layers for energy supply carrying a micro-structured catalytic burner, which was fed with anode off-gas surrogate and reaction layers which carried catalyst for the oxidative steam reforming of propylene glycol. A complete integrated and compact fuel processor is under development including <b>start-up</b> <b>burner</b> and CO clean-up. It is to the authors’ knowledge the first fuel processor for steam reforming of polyalcohols of that size presented in open literature...|$|E

GCT 3 was planned as a 250 -hour test run to commission the loop seal and continue the characterization {{of the limits of}} operational parameter variations using a blend of several Powder River Basin coals and Bucyrus limestone from Ohio. The primary test objectives were: (1) Loop Seal Commissioning [...] Evaluate the operational stability of the loop seal with sand and limestone as a bed material at different solids circulation rates and establish a maximum solids circulation rate through the loop seal with the inert bed. (2) Loop Seal Operations [...] Evaluate the loop seal operational stability during coal feed operations and establish maximum solids circulation rate. Secondary objectives included the continuation of reactor characterization, including: (1) Operational Stability [...] Characterize the reactor loop and PCD operations with short-term tests by varying coal feed, air/coal ratio, riser velocity, solids circulation rate, system pressure, and air distribution. (2) Reactor Operations [...] Study the devolatilization and tar cracking effects from transient conditions during transition from <b>start-up</b> <b>burner</b> to coal.

Test run GCT 3 was started on December 1, 2000, with the startup of the thermal oxidizer fan, and was completed on February 1, 2001. This test was conducted in two parts; the loop seal was commissioned during {{the first part of this}} test run from December 1 through 15, which consisted of hot inert solids circulation testing. These initial tests provided preliminary data necessary to understand different parameters associated with the operation and performance of the loop seal. The loop seal was tested with coal feed during the second part of the test run and additional data was gathered to analyze reactor operations and to identify necessary modifications to improve equipment and process performance. In the second part of GCT 3, the gasification portion of the test, from January 20 to February 1, 2001, the mixing zone and riser temperatures were varied between 1, 675 and 1, 825 F at pressures ranging from 200 to 240 psig.
