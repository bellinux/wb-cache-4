5|$|Drosera anglica, {{commonly}} known as the English <b>sundew</b> or great <b>sundew,</b> is a carnivorous plant species belonging to the <b>sundew</b> family Droseraceae. It is a temperate species with a generally circumboreal range, although it does occur as far south as Japan, southern Europe, and the island of Kauai in Hawaii, where it grows as a subtropical <b>sundew.</b> It is thought to originate from an amphidiploid hybrid of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis, meaning that a sterile hybrid between these two species doubled its chromosomes to produce fertile progeny which stabilized into the current D. anglica.|$|E
5|$|The corms of the {{tuberous}} sundews {{native to}} Australia {{are considered a}} delicacy by the Australian Aborigines. Some of these corms were also used to dye textiles, while another purple or yellow dye was traditionally prepared in the Scottish Highlands using D. rotundifolia. A <b>sundew</b> liqueur is also still produced using a recipe from the 14th century. It is made using fresh leaves from mainly D. capensis, D. spatulata, and D. rotundifolia.|$|E
5|$|The genus, though, is very {{variable}} {{in terms of}} habitat. Individual <b>sundew</b> species have adapted {{to a wide variety}} of environments, including atypical habitats, such as rainforests, deserts (D. burmannii and D. indica), and even highly shaded environments (Queensland sundews). The temperate species, which form hibernacula in the winter, are examples of such adaptation to habitats; in general, sundews tend to inhabit warm climates, and are only moderately frost-resistant.|$|E
25|$|The {{first volume}} deals {{exclusively}} with tuberous <b>sundews</b> (genus Drosera). The second {{is devoted to}} pygmy <b>sundews,</b> but also includes three tuberous species described {{since the publication of}} the first volume, as well as two other <b>sundews</b> that do not fit elsewhere (D.glanduligera and D.hamiltonii). The final volume includes the remaining <b>sundews</b> of Australia, together with native species of Aldrovanda, Byblis, Cephalotus, Nepenthes, and Utricularia. Each species is given a four-page treatment, with one page for a botanical description, one for a line drawing of the author's creation, one for a distribution map, and one for assorted colour photographs.|$|R
50|$|Tuberous <b>sundews</b> are {{species of}} the genus Drosera that have evolved to live in summer drought {{conditions}} and aestivate as a dormant underground tuber. While many tuberous <b>sundews</b> are ground-hugging rosettes, D. peltata is an upright species with a simple or branching inflorescence.|$|R

5|$|The lake {{is home to}} American beavers, as well {{as great}} blue heron, swans, snow geese, common loons, and many other types of waterfowl, with Canada goose, ring-necked duck, mallard, and wood duck the most {{commonly}} seen. The bogs, marshes, and swamps contain frogs and salamanders, and provide a habitat for carnivorous plants like the pitcher plant and <b>sundew.</b> Black Moshannon State Park is home to many common species of songbirds, including ovenbirds.|$|E
5|$|Drosera anglica {{grows in}} open, non-forested habitat with wet, often calcium-rich soils. These include bogs, marl fens, quaking bogs, cobble shores, and other {{calcareous}} habitats. This tolerance of calcium is relatively {{rare in the}} rest of the genus. D. anglica is often associated with various sphagnum mosses, and many times grows in a soil substrate that is entirely composed of living, dead, or decomposed sphagnum. The sphagnum wicks moisture to the surface while simultaneously acidifying it. What soil nutrients are not seeped away by the constant moisture are often used up by the sphagnum or made unavailable by the low soil pH. Since nutrient availability is low, competition from other plants is diminished, allowing the carnivorous English <b>sundew</b> to flourish.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the <b>sundew</b> genus {{stretches}} from Alaska in the north to New Zealand in the south. The centers of diversity are Australia, with roughly 50% of all known species, and South America and southern Africa, each with more than 20 species. A few species are also found in large parts of Eurasia and North America. These areas, however, can be considered to form {{the outskirts of the}} generic range, as the ranges of sundews do not typically approach temperate or Arctic areas. Contrary to previous supposition, the evolutionary speciation of this genus is no longer thought to have occurred with the breakup of Gondwana through continental drift. Rather, speciation is now thought to have occurred {{as a result of a}} subsequent wide dispersal of its range. The origins of the genus are thought to have been in Africa or Australia.|$|E
5|$|Vegetative {{reproduction}} occurs {{naturally in}} some species that produce stolons or when roots {{come close to}} the surface of the soil. Older leaves that touch the ground may sprout plantlets. Pygmy <b>sundews</b> reproduce asexually using specialized scale-like leaves called gemmae. Tuberous <b>sundews</b> can produce offsets from their corms.|$|R
5|$|Tuberous sundews: These nearly 50 Australian species form an {{underground}} tuber {{to survive the}} extremely dry summers of their habitat, re-emerging in the autumn. These so-called tuberous <b>sundews</b> can be further divided into two groups, those that form rosettes and those that form climbing or scrambling stems. Tuberous <b>sundews</b> comprise the subgenus Ergaleium.|$|R
2500|$|Schnell {{suggested}} {{that some of}} the book's smaller images would benefit from enlargement, finding certain morphological details difficult to discern. He added that [...] "some might question" [...] the inclusion of many undescribed taxa and several newly described species of tuberous <b>sundews,</b> the latter appearing somewhat out-of-place in a book otherwise devoted to pygmy <b>sundews.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{tree nursery}} was {{established}} at Kinloch in 1960 {{in order to}} support a substantial programme of re-introducing twenty native species including silver birch, hawthorn, rowan and holly. The forested area, which consists of over a million re-introduced native trees and shrubs, is essentially confined to the vicinity of Kinloch and the slopes near this site surrounding Loch Scresort and on nearby Meall á Ghoirtein. The island's flora came to widespread attention with the 1999 publication of the book A Rum Affair by Karl Sabbagh, a British writer and television producer. The book told of a long-running scientific controversy over the alleged discovery of certain plants on Rùm by botanist John William Heslop-Harrison—discoveries that are now considered to be fraudulent. Heslop Harrison is widely believed to have placed many of these plants on the island himself to provide evidence for his theory about the geological development of the Hebridean islands. Nonetheless, the native flora offers much of interest. There are rare arctic sandwort and alpine pennycress, endemic varieties of the heath spotted-orchid and eyebright, as well as more common species such as <b>sundew,</b> butterwort, blue heath milkwort and roseroot. A total of 590 higher plant and fern taxa have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|The large {{diversity}} of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the herbage and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is {{more than any other}} mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. Adams is home to many rare plants including tall bugbane, Suksdorf’s monkeyflower, northern microseris (Microceris borealis), Brewer’s potentilla (Potentilla breweri), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many meadows and wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta paintbrush, arrowleaf ragwort, penstemons, lupines, monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog blueberry, highbush cranberry, <b>sundew,</b> purple cinquefoil, and flatleaf bladderwort, in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a beautiful display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob’s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.|$|E

5|$|Medicinal {{preparations}} {{are primarily}} made using the roots, flowers, and fruit-like capsules. Since all native <b>sundews</b> species are protected {{in many parts}} of Europe and North America, extracts are usually prepared using cultivated fast-growing <b>sundews</b> (specifically D. rotundifolia, D. intermedia, D. anglica, D. ramentacea and D. madagascariensis) or from plants collected and imported from Madagascar, Spain, France, Finland and the Baltics.|$|R

25|$|Tannersville Cranberry Bog - Tannersville Cranberry Bog is in Pocono Township, Monroe County. This bog, {{owned by}} The Nature Conservancy, is the southernmost low-altitude hemiboreal bog. The bog {{is home to}} rare orchids and some {{carnivorous}} plants like <b>sundew</b> and the pitcher plant.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 20th century, {{the area of}} {{heathland}} has been substantially reduced by the encroachment of scrub, birch, alder and willow. The incursion of trees has caused the heath to become drier, resulting {{in the loss of}} some wet heath plants, including bog asphodel and round-leaved <b>sundew.</b>|$|E
25|$|Drosera meristocaulis is a {{perennial}} {{species in the}} carnivorous plant genus Drosera, {{the only member of}} the subgenus Meristocaulis. It is a small, rosette- and branched stem-forming <b>sundew</b> that has many morphological affinities to the Australian pygmy sundews. D.meristocaulis is wholly endemic to Pico da Neblina, an isolated mountain on the Brazil-Venezuela border.|$|E

25|$|The Lake District {{is home to}} a {{great variety}} of wildlife, due to its range of varied topography, lakes and forests. It {{provides}} a home for the red squirrel and colonies of <b>sundew</b> and butterwort, two of the few carnivorous plants native to Britain. The Lake District is a major sanctuary for the red squirrel and has the largest population in England (out of the estimated 140,000 red squirrels in the United Kingdom, compared with about 2.5million grey squirrels).|$|E
25|$|These traps may {{be active}} or passive, {{depending}} on whether movement aids the capture of prey. For example, Triphyophyllum is a passive flypaper that secretes mucilage, but whose leaves do not grow or move in response to prey capture. Meanwhile, sundews are active flypaper traps whose leaves undergo rapid acid growth, which is an expansion of individual cells as opposed to cell division. The rapid acid growth allows the <b>sundew</b> tentacles to bend, aiding in the retention and digestion of prey.|$|E
