We optically acquired fiber bundle size measurements {{to learn about}} the pre-needling process, the hydroentangling process and the influence of fiber blend composition on fiber entanglement. Fiber entanglement measurements were compared to basis weight uniformity measurements. One of the bed sheet developments utilized a combination of bonding technologies (<b>spunlacing</b> and thermal bonding) that used low energy.

30|$|In today’s fast-spaced life, {{convenience}} {{has become}} the priority for wipe products such as moist toilette tissues, bath/bathing wipes, and dispersible moist wipes [1]. When referring to the wiping material that requires for skin contact, <b>spunlace</b> nonwovens have emerged as the preferred fabrics. <b>Spunlace</b> fabrics comprise the largest segment of nonwovens for wipes due to their excellent properties [2]. Unfortunately, the traditional <b>spunlace</b> nonwoven wipes often contain fully entangled synthetic fibers and are difficult to be dispersed or degraded after being discarded into toilet, which results in adversely impacting plumbing or wastewater infrastructure.|$|E
30|$|As of now, wetlace {{technology}} for dispersible moist wipe has been drawing great attention due to sufficient wet strength in use and rapid disintegration after use [3, 4]. It {{is evident that}} wetlace method contains wetlaid and <b>spunlace</b> processes. Wetlaid process offers high production speed and great flexibility to achieve homogeneous paper-based products [5, 6]. <b>Spunlace</b> uses fine, closely spaced, high-speed waterjets that strike a web of fibers on a drum or a belt to form <b>spunlace</b> nonwoven by rearranging and entangling the fibers [7]. <b>Spunlace</b> nonwoven with excellent properties (softness, comfortable, and high strength) can be widely applied in disposable moist wipes [8, 9]. However, material wet strength and dispersibiltiy {{is a couple of}} contradictions. To maintain the balance between them, reasonable processing technology needs to be chosen.|$|E
30|$|In the <b>spunlace</b> process, it {{had five}} {{manifolds}} labeled at jet heads 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (JH 1, JH 2, JH 3, JH 4 and JH 5), {{as shown in}} Fig.  1 a. Figure  1 b showed the change of wetlaid nonwoven structure after <b>spunlace</b> process. For all the samples, JH 1 and JH 2 pressures both were kept constant at 40 bars. While it used the JH 3, JH 4, or JH 5, each manifold was operated at the same waterjet pressure of 55 bars. In addition, each wetlaid nonwoven was respectively strengthened with four schemes of waterjet pressure sums (80, 135, 190, and 245 bars), which are listed in Table  2. The jet strips fitted into the jet heads had 24 nozzles·cm− 1 of 0.12  mm in diameter.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} an {{experimental study of}} three types of non-woven preforms (needlepunched, <b>spunlaced</b> and mat manufactured using a paper-making process) intended as composite reinforcement. These are potentially very attractive for transport applications. First, the influence of processing on elementary fiber tensile properties is shown to be limited. Then the preforms are evaluated in polypropylene matrix composites and mechanical properties are determined. The structure of non-woven reinforcements {{is strongly dependent on}} the manufacturing route. By varying the fiber content it is shown that the most efficient reinforcement for flax fibers is the mat produced by paper processing. The new <b>spunlaced</b> reinforced composites are shown to have slightly lower tensile properties (15 % lower strength, and 25 % lower stiffness) compared to mat composites at equivalent volume fraction, but further optimization is possible for these materials. Based on the measured constituent properties micromechanics models have been used to estimate composite stiffness. A good correlation is obtained between test results and model predictions...|$|R

Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) as a {{thermoplastic}} and biodegradable material holds good prospect in medical, agricultural, apparel, upholstery, hygiene, {{and other}} {{applications in the}} form of fiber. Among them, the nonwoven produced with PLA fiber {{is one of the most}} important forms. In this paper, the biodegradable properties of PLA fiber were reviewed. Moreover, some manufacturing processes of the biodegradable PLA product, such as <b>spunlaced,</b> spunbonded thermal, spunbonded needle punched, melt-blown were also summarized. It also draws some conclusions about the current problems and the prospect...|$|R
50|$|Hydroentanglement is {{sometimes}} known as <b>spunlacing,</b> this term arising because the early nonwovens were entangled on conveyors with a patterned weave {{which gave the}} nonwovens a lacy appearance. It can also {{be regarded as a}} two-dimensional equivalent of spinning fibres into yarns prior to weaving. The water pressure has a direct bearing on the strength of the web, and very high pressures not only entangle but can also split fibres into micro- and nano-fibres which give the resulting hydroentangled nonwoven a leatherlike or even silky texture. This type of nonwoven can be as strong and tough as woven fabrics made from the same fibres.|$|R
30|$|As expected, wetlace {{material}} {{belongs to}} <b>spunlace</b> nonwoven. The properties of wetlace nonwoven are also determined by fiber entanglement degree [10]. As for wetlace nonwoven, many factors affect fiber entanglements and cohesions, i.e., pressure sum, fiber blend ratio, and basis weight [11]. Pressure sum represents {{the sum of}} each Jet Head pressure in <b>spunlace</b> process and always {{gives rise to the}} fiber entanglements. A high pressure sum has greatly potential to change the web structures and significant effect on the properties of subsequent products [7, 12]. Different fibers have different flexibility property. There is no doubt that different fiber blend ratios lead to different fiber entanglements and cohesions under the same waterjet pressure sum [13]. At the same time, different basis weights significantly affect the processing and production properties [14]. However, there are not reported studies for wood pulp/Lyocell wetlace nonwovens involving in these parameters.|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  3 a, Lyocell fiber has {{circular}} cross-section and smooth surface. Figure  3 b shows that wood pulp has flat cross-section {{and the surface}} is uneven with a few drapes along the fiber axis. After <b>spunlace,</b> Lyocell and wood pulp are swirled and entangled with each other. Notably, the nonwoven shown in Fig.  3 d is bonded at pressure sum of 245 bars and it visually displays {{a greater number of}} “U” shape entanglements (red circle regions) compared to the nonwoven, as shown in Fig.  3 c, which is produced at pressure sum of 135 bars. It {{may be due to the}} fact that the increase in pressure sum results in increasing the fiber entanglements [7]. Meanwhile, the red dashed area (see Fig.  3 d) exhibits obvious condensed ribbon-like structures (<b>spunlace</b> channels). However, wetlace nonwoven suffered from pressure sum of 135 bars has not obvious channel region due to low water pressure sum in manufacturing [2].|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of five {{decontamination}} methods on the filter quality (qf) of three commercially available electret masks-N 95, Gauze and <b>Spunlace</b> nonwoven masks. Newly developed evaluation methods, the overall filter quality (qf,o) and the qf ratio were applied {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of decontamination methods for respirators. A scanning mobility particle sizer is utilized to measure the concentration of polydispersed particles with diameter 14. 6 - 594 nm. The penetration of particles and pressure drop (Δp) through the mask are used to determine qf and qf,o. Experimental results reveal that the most penetrating particle size (MPS) for the pre-decontaminated N 95, Gauze and <b>Spunlace</b> masks were 118 nm, 461 nm and 279 nm, respectively, and the respective penetration rates were 2. 6 %, 23. 2 % and 70. 0 %. The Δp through the pretreated N 95 masks was 9. 2 mm H 2 O at the breathing flow rate of heavy-duty workers, exceeding the Δp values obtained through Gauze and <b>Spunlace</b> masks. Decontamination increased the sizes of the most penetrating particles, changing the qf values of all of the masks: qf fell as particle size increased because the penetration increased. Bleach increased the Δp of N 95, but destroyed the Gauze mask. However, the use of an autoclave reduces the Δp values of both the N 95 and the Gauze mask. Neither the rice cooker nor ethanol altered the Δp of the Gauze mask. Chemical decontamination methods reduced the qf,o values for the three electret masks. The value of qf,o for PM 0. 1 exceeded that for PM 0. 1 - 0. 6, because particles smaller than 100 nm had lower penetration, resulting in a better qf for a given pressure drop. The values of qf,o, particularly for PM 0. 1, reveal that for the tested treatments and masks, physical decontamination methods are less destructive to the filter than chemical methods. Nevertheless, when purchasing new or reusing FFRs, penetration should be regarded as the priority...|$|E
40|$|New {{nonwoven}} products containing {{cotton and}} Lyocell (Trademarked name Tencel), low temperature thermal-bondable bicomponent olefin/polyester, or comber noils were developed using needlepunching and <b>spunlacing</b> (hydroentanglement).

We acquired detailed basis weight uniformity measurements {{to learn about}} processing {{and the influence of}} fiber blend composition on web uniformity. Basis weight uniformity was evaluated without regard to web direction ("Total" uniformity), along the machine direction (MD uniformity) and across the cross direction (CD uniformity) at numerous size resolutions.

In this paper, we propose {{a new approach}} integrating an agent- based modelling with case-based reasoning that utilizes similarity measures and preferences module. The main purpose of our study is to compare and evaluate the most suitable similarity measure for our case. Furthermore, operators that are usually geographically dispersed, have to collaborate and negotiate to achieve mutual agreements, especially when their proposals (diagnosis) lead to a conflicting situation. The experimentation shows that the suggested agent-based approach is very interesting and efficient for operators and experts who collaborate in INOTIS enterprise...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} examine {{objective}} evaluation equations for disposable diaper's top sheets, representative top sheets are evaluated by those equations and by subjective method comparing with reusable diaper's fabrics. Following conclusions were obtained. Objective evaluation equation for primary hand (DPCM- 1) is useful for calculation of primary hands "NAMERAKASA" and "KOSHI", however, it is not effective to "SOFUTOSA" and "FUKURAMI". Two objective evaluation equations for total hand value (THV) (DPCM- 2, 3) are both available for top sheets. THV decreased {{in the order of}} spunbond, air-through, meltblow, and <b>spunlace</b> for both objective and subjective values. Used fabric for reusable diapers examined here (plain weave) has higher "NAMERAKASA", "SOFUTOSA" "FUKURAMI" and THV, however, lower "KOSHI" than the original fabric. © 2008 The Textile Machinery Society of Japan...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The spunlacing {{technique}} for producing auto interior nonwovens is examined. A 50 / 50 flax/polypropylene nonwoven is processed using an AquaJet <b>spunlace</b> system with two different spunlacing settings. The spunlaced nonwovens are thermally bonded into 2 D and 3 D interior parts {{by a panel}} press and a stamp-forming press. Physical properties, mechanical properties, and moldability of the nonwovens after spunlacing and molding are evaluated in accordance with relevant European and German industrial standards. The statistical method of variance analysis and image analysis method are used for data process. The research work finds that the spunlacing process brings some technical merits for the flax/polypropylene nonwoven in auto interior applications, in particular, an enhancement of tensile and flexural strengths, a large thickness reduction with controlled ultimate weight, and a competitive moldability. The experimental data also reveals that using a setting *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the fabrication of thin film silicon solar cells constructed onto polyester textile substrates is presented. The absence of a photovoltaic effect {{was found to be}} due to oxygen contamination in the silicon layers of the cell stack. This was concluded from FTIR absorption lines, as the Si-H 2 peak had been blue-shifted from its original location, through the inductive effect of oxygen atoms being incorporated into the molecule. From the current-voltage analysis of the cells, the oxygen contamination was reconfirmed, as an electric field ample enough to create a depletion region across the i-layer to result in a PV effect, could not be established. Through the use of fibre melding techniques, amorphous/nanocrystalline silicon semiconductor junctions were successfully deposited on thermally bonded nonwoven <b>spunlace.</b> (hydroentanglement) PET. This new technique reduoed the density of electrical breaks within the textile, thus rectifying junctions possessing characteristics analogous to those deposited on solid glass sheets produced.

40|$|Surgical gowns are {{considered}} non active medical devices. They can be single-use or reusable and during an operation {{they are in}} constant contact with the human skin. Interaction with human senses is therefore an important performance property.

A parameter laboratory instrument was designed at the University of Minho based on an innovative method of acessing friction coefficient of 2 D surfaces (fabrics, nonwovens, soft papers). Unlike other methods, the instrument FRICTORQ is based on a rotary movement and therefore on the measurement of a friction reaction torque. A short description of the FRICTORQ instrument will be given as well as its fundamentals and working principle followed by a study, where a comparison of the coefficient of friction between three different materials for manufacturing surgical gowns was performed.

40|$|Nonwoven {{single-use}} surgical gowns {{are used}} and frequently {{touched by the}} human skin. Interaction with human senses is therefore an important performance property. When touched by the human hand, friction {{is one of the}} first feelings and therefore friction coefficient is an important parameter. Recently, a patented laboratory instrument was investigated and designed at the University of Minho based on an innovative method of accessing friction coefficient of 2 D surfaces (fabrics, nonwovens, soft papers). Unlikely other methods, FRICTORQ is based on a rotary movement and therefore on the measurement of a friction reaction torque. On the more recent version the contact between the 2 D sample and the instrument contact sensor is restricted to 3 small special elements radially disposed at 120 °. Providing during the test a relative displacement of approximately 90 °, it is assured that a new portion of the sample is always moved under the sensors. In the model, friction coefficient is worked out from the friction reaction torque measured by means of a high sensitivity torque sensor, the normal load created by the contact sensor and a geometrical parameter. Contact pressure on the fabric samples was set to 3, 5 kPa and the linear velocity in the geometric centre of each contact element was approximately 1, 5 mm/s. In the paper, a description of the instrument is given as well as its fundamentals and working principle followed by a study, where a comparison between three different materials for manufacturing medical gowns was performed under controlled atmosphere.
