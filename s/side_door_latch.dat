50|$|Unfortunately {{a problem}} with the van's <b>side</b> <b>door</b> <b>latch</b> meant they were delayed for an hour, and the {{brothers}} had to wait for that hour. But when they saw it, they put their plan into action. Michael hid under the dash while Patrick drove the car. After pulling the armored car over, Patrick went {{to the side of the}} van and approached the guards and asked the driver to step out but then Michael went to the other side of the armored car and the brothers took the guards captive. Patrick Poland continued to drive the fake police vehicle while the other was to drive the armored truck. But when Patrick took off his brother did not follow so he reversed the fake cruiser in front of the armored car and then proceeded to see what was going on. By the time he reached the back Michael was already beating the two guards and Patrick told him to stop it and Michael went to get a pair of tasers which they used to stun the guards. The two brothers then drove the vehicles to a remote area near the town of Bumble Bee, where they abandoned the truck. Patrick's decision to reverse the car to a spot in front of the van, left the tire tracks which would later be found by investigators.|$|E
40|$|Physical {{modeling}} is a {{modeling and}} simulation technique that captures the physics and mathematics of a system through high fidelity dynamic models {{which are based on}} equations and symbolic manipulation. In this study, a physical model of a <b>side</b> <b>door</b> <b>latch</b> release mechanism for an automotive application has been developed in Dynamic Modelling Laboratory (Dymola) which is a popular multi-domain object-oriented physical modelling tool. The performance of the developed door lock model is evaluated against measurements from a real vehicle door latch. The variables of the developed physical model of the door latch are parameterized against supplier specification or calculated from standard textbook equations. The model accurately emulates the degree of mobility of the door latch design by investigating the required voltage and timing requirements for the locking/unlocking functions, given a set of parameters within the normal operating range. ...|$|E
5000|$|Sgt. Mark Smith, {{head of the}} {{forensics}} unit of the Saint John Police Force, said {{he spent}} 3 days following the July 14, 2011 search of Dennis's home doing a [...] "very thorough search" [...] of Dennis's car. [...] Ten {{different areas of the}} car were swabbed, including the driver's <b>side</b> <b>door</b> inside <b>latch</b> and handle, the trunk release button, the headlight switch, signal light switch, the steering wheel, the emergency brake, and seats of the car. The swabs were sent away on July 21, 2011, for forensic testing at the RCMP crime lab in Nova Scotia, but no blood or DNA was detected through these tests, either.|$|R

50|$|A {{door handle}} is an {{attached}} object or mechanism used to manually open or close a door. In the United States, a door handle generally refers to any fixed or lever-operated <b>door</b> <b>latch</b> device.

50|$|They {{are used}} in many dishwashers to release the {{detergent}} dispenser <b>door</b> <b>latch.</b> The wax motor acts like a solenoid when activated by the dishwasher's timer or control, and the piston operates the mechanism which then releases the catch for the dispenser door.

"The {{potential}} for long term Convair liability has been causing me increasing concern for several reasonsâ€¦ The fundamental {{safety of the}} cargo <b>door</b> <b>latching</b> system has been progressively degraded since the program began in 1968...
