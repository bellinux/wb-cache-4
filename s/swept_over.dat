5|$|As Siletzia accreted it also {{jammed the}} {{existing}} subduction zone, halting subduction of the Farallon plate. This terminated the Laramide orogeny {{that had been}} uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and triggered the ignimbrite sweep, a wave of large-volume silicic magmatism that <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> much of western North America between 50 and 20 Ma. This undoubtedly affected the enigmatic and controversial Challis Arc (stretching from southeastern British Columbia to the Idaho Batholith, roughly parallel with the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament), but {{the details of this}} are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{countries}} {{felt the}} effects of Hurricane Dean as its path through the Caribbean Sea claimed 42lives. The hurricane first brushed the Lesser Antilles on August 17, 2007, and as it passed through {{the interior of the}} Caribbean its outer rain bands <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> the Greater Antilles. It passed Jamaica as a Category4 hurricane, and strengthened to a Category5 storm as it made landfall on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula on August 21. A second landfall on August 22 was less devastating.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Favio, {{flooding}} <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> Mozambique weeks earlier, forcing 163,000persons to seek shelter. The floods started in late December2006 when the Cahora Bassa Dam overflowed its banks. The floods escalated in February2007 when the Zambezi River broke its banks, flooding the surrounding areas in Mozambique. A total of 80,600 people were evacuated from their homes in the Tete, Manica, Sofala and Zambezia provinces on February14. Twenty-nine people were confirmed dead due to the pre-Favio flood.|$|E
5|$|Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Cayman Islands {{experienced}} high {{surf and}} heavy rains, though despite a power outage in Grand Cayman, no significant damage was reported. There, 2000people weathered the storm in temporary shelters. The hurricane's outer bands <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> Cuba between August 19 and August 21, bringing heavy rain and high seas, yet sparing the island from damaging winds. Rain from Hurricane Dean flooded several roads throughout Puerto Rico, {{and there was}} heavy surf along the island's coast, but no deaths or injuries were reported.|$|E
5|$|Rain from Hurricane Dean closed several roads {{throughout}} Puerto Rico {{and there}} was heavy surf along the island's coast, but no deaths or injuries were reported. The hurricane's outer bands <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> Cuba between August 19 and August 21, bringing heavy rain and high seas, but sparing the island its damaging winds. In the Cayman Islands, rain flooded roads and there were high waves along the coast, but no deaths or serious injuries were reported. There were localized power outages and the water supply was shut off briefly, {{but the rest of}} the island's infrastructure was unaffected. Approximately 2,000people weathered the storm in temporary shelters.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Dean in the Greater Antilles were spread over six {{countries}} and included 20deaths. Hurricane Dean {{formed in the}} Atlantic Ocean west of Cape Verde on August 14 {{as part of the}} 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. The Cape Verde-type hurricane tracked steadily westward into the Caribbean, where it rapidly intensified. Its outer bands <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> the Greater Antilles; the storm surge was felt from the eastern side of Puerto Rico to the western tip of Cuba. It brushed the island of Jamaica as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale before striking Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula at Category5 strength.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{fringes of}} Hurricane Dean <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> Haiti {{bringing}} heavy squalls. On Gonâve Island, {{thousands of people}} lost power and some took shelter in schools and churches. The roof of the Hopital St. Michel in Jacmel, damaged before the storm, leaked significantly leading to water damage in the operating room. Two {{people were killed in}} Tiburon and Moron, towns in the south and southeast of the island, respectively. Seven other storm-related deaths were confirmed but few details were given. Another four were injured in a sailboat after disregarding warnings to stay in port. Several hundred homes were destroyed due to the resulting landslides. In the department of Sud-Est, Nippes, Centre, and Artibonite, 5,154people retreated to temporary shelters. Hurricanes typically pose significant hazards to potable water in Haiti, but Hurricane Dean produced only a modest 2.06inches (52mm) of rainfall. As such, the storm caused no major problems with water and sanitation, except in the town of Bainet, where the temperamental water system was compromised.|$|E
5|$|With no {{prospect}} of Tony's money, Beaver loses interest in Brenda, who is left adrift and in poverty. Meanwhile, Tony has met an explorer, Dr. Messinger, and joins him on an expedition {{in search of}} a supposed lost city in the Amazon rainforest. On the outward journey, Tony engages in a shipboard romance with Thérèse de Vitré, a young girl whose Roman Catholicism causes her to shun him when he tells her he has a wife. In Brazil, Messinger proves an incompetent organiser; he cannot control the native guides, who abandon him and Tony {{in the depths of the}} jungle. Tony falls ill, and Messinger leaves in their only canoe to find help, but is <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> a waterfall and killed.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Dean, at {{its second}} landfall, dropped 4 to 8in (100 to 200mm) of {{rainfall}} across {{the western states}} of Jalisco and Nayarit. This rainfall trigged a mudslide in Jalisco which fell on 10houses and killed one of the occupants. Landslides in Puebla killed five people, and another was crushed when a wall in his house collapsed. One person in Veracruz was electrocuted after touching a power line while repairing his roof. In Michoacán, as the outer bands of the storm <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> the state, a man sheltering under a tree was struck by lightning. Two women died in Hidalgo when heavy rain collapsed their house's roof. Another man drowned while trying to cross a rain-swollen river in Tlacolula, Oaxaca. The heavy rains caused dozens of smaller landslides throughout the country, particularly in Veracruz and Tabasco, {{but most of them}} caused no fatalities. At least 50,000houses were damaged to varying degrees throughout the country. Although Dean's rains caused flooding as far inland as Mexico City, where they closed a portion of Puebla-Mexico highway, the damage was concentrated in the states of Quintana Roo and Veracruz.|$|E
5|$|In 750 CE, {{the last}} Umayyad caliph Marwan II was {{defeated}} by the Abbasid As-Saffah in the Battle of the Zab {{on the banks of}} the Khazir River, a tributary to the Great Zab. When the Mongols <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> Iraq in the 13th century and sacked Arbil, many survivors sought a refuge in the inaccessible valleys of the Great Zab. The Sapna Valley was home to both Christian and Muslim communities, as evidenced by Christian artefacts found at Zawi Chemi Shanidar. During the 19th century, the area was controlled by local Kurdish leaders. During World War I, heavy fighting took place in the area, and Rowanduz was pillaged by Russian soldiers in 1916. Following World War I, episodes of heavy fighting took place between the Barzani tribe – striving for the establishment of an independent Kurdish polity – and several other Kurdish tribes, and between the Barzanis and the Iraqi Government. The last of these uprisings started in 1974 and led to heavy bombardments of towns and villages in the Great Zab basin.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April, 4th Regiment Hurricanes {{successfully}} {{shot down}} a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter over Nova Gradiška. The following day, {{two or three}} of the remaining 105th Squadron Hurricanes were burned by ground crews at Veliki Radinci, while other machines from the same squadron flew to Bijeljina, where other aircraft had concentrated. This move had only just been completed when a large formation of German Bf 110s <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> the airfield and destroyed over two dozen aircraft, including {{all but one of the}} 105th Squadron Hurricanes. At Knić, approaching German vehicles caused the last two 163rd Squadron Hurricanes to scramble, flying to Zemun. The first pilot landed safely, but was immediately captured by armed Volksdeutsche. The other pilot, seeing that Zemun was not safe, broke off and tried to fly to Bjeljina, but ran out of fuel and was killed when he tried to crash-land near Valjevo. Even at this late stage, the 4th Regiment still had five or six airworthy Hurricanes. They continued to chase reconnaissance aircraft throughout the day, shooting down one Ju 88 near Banja Luka. When German bombers again attacked the airfields around Mostar, the one remaining Hurricane of the Air Training School attacked a Ju 88 but was hit by return fire, forcing the pilot to bail out.|$|E

25|$|The Bhakti {{movement}} {{refers to}} the theistic devotional trend that emerged in medieval Hinduism and later revolutionised in Sikhism. It originated in the seventh-century south India (now parts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala), and spread northwards. It <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> east and north India from the 15th century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century CE.|$|E
25|$|In the WB-62 Sumerian king list recension, Ziusudra, or Zin-Suddu of Shuruppak is {{recorded}} as having reigned as both king and gudug priest for 10 sars, or periods of 3,600 years, although {{this was probably}} a copy error for 10 years. In this version, Ziusudra inherited rulership from his father Šuruppak (written SU.KUR.LAM) who ruled for 10 sars. The line following Ziusudra in WB-62 reads: Then the flood <b>swept</b> <b>over.</b> The next line reads: After the flood <b>swept</b> <b>over,</b> kingship descended from heaven; the kingship was in Kish. The city of Kish flourished in the Early Dynastic period soon after an archaeologically attested river flood in Shuruppak (modern Tell Fara, Iraq) and various other Sumerian cities. This flood has been radiocarbon dated to ca. 2900 BC. Polychrome pottery from the Jemdet Nasr period (ca. 3000–2900 BC) was discovered immediately below the Shuruppak flood stratum, and the Jemdet Nasr period immediately preceded the Early Dynastic I period.|$|E
25|$|After the Enlightenment, {{most of the}} expeditions {{that went}} to East Africa and the Pacific had Teide {{as one of the}} most {{rewarding}} targets. The expedition of Lord George Macartney, George Staunton and John Barrow in 1792 almost ended in tragedy, as a major snowstorm and rain <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> them and they failed to reach the peak of Teide, just barely getting past Montaña Blanca.|$|E

25|$|Mallory {{organised}} a third unsuccessful {{attempt on}} the summit, departing as the monsoon season arrived. While Mallory was leading a group of porters down the lower slopes of the North Col of Everest in fresh, waist-deep snow, an avalanche <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> the group, killing seven Sherpas. The attempt was immediately abandoned, and Mallory was subsequently accused of poor judgement, including by expedition participants such as Dr. Longstaff.|$|E

While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town.|$|E
25|$|Hurricane Betsy <b>swept</b> <b>over</b> the New Orleans area on {{the evening}} of September 9, 1965.

Arabi and Chalmette are in St. Bernard Parish east and below New Orleans on the east bank of the Mississippi River. All of St. Bernard parish is sandwiched between the MRGO and the Mississippi River.|$|E
