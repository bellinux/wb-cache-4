30|$|The {{bacteriocin}} {{production and}} detection {{was performed in}} vitro and accompanied by the production of other bacterial metabolites (such as lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide) that were previously described for this strain. Thus, {{to assure that the}} bioactivity assessed for the protein extract was not related to these metabolites, their effect was neutralized. Thus, the experimental results suggest that a proteinaceous antimicrobial compound, bacteriocin, had been produced and secreted by LaKS 400 into the extracellular culture medium. The bacteriocin production occurs during the exponential phase reaching its maximum during the stationary phase of the strain growth curve (between 24 and 30  h after the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>fermentation),</b> as described for other bacteriocins (De Vuyst et al. 1996; De Vuyst and Vandamme 1992; Zamfir et al. 2000).

This change in the bioactivity can be related to protein aggregation or proteolytic degradation of the bacteriocin (Law and Kolstad 1983).|$|R
30|$|We {{discussed}} {{lag phase}} in previous paper (Hussain et al. 2015), as adaptation time of yeast within new environment at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>fermentation.</b> The reason observed {{might be the}} occurrence of significant mass transfer effects when reaction takes place inside the catalyst (beads) (Salmon and Robertson 1987; Anselme and Tedder 1987). The effect of internal mass transfer resistance on lag phase could be understood from Figs.  2 and 3 which shows that lag phase duration for both types of beads (chitosan and non-chitosan coated) sharply reduced by reducing the size of beads. In literature, there is enough data on the inhibition of yeast growth and metabolic activities by high initial substrate concentration (Galaction et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2012), and the result depicts that substrate or product inhibition phenomenon can limit the efficiency of ethanol production and leads to enhance the lag phase <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> process.

40|$|Three {{different}} processes combining cooking (C), {{addition of}} malt (M) and/or backslop inoculation (1) were investigated {{to increase the}} energy density (ED) of ben-saalga, a millet-based fermented gruel and their effects on fermentation kinetics and microbiological characteristics were assessed. In the process combining cooking and inoculation (CI) and in the control (traditional processing methods), glucose and fructose were the main sugars and their concentrations decreased during the settling step (fermentation). In the process combinations that included the addition of malt (CM and CMI), maltose was the main sugar that accumulated during settling. In the CM process combination, the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> was considerably delayed due to the marked reduction in natural microflora during cooking. In contrast, in the CI and CMI process combinations, inoculation by back slopping accelerated acidification, resulting in a pH value of below 4. 0 after 7 h <b>of</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Although malt was added at a very low rate (0. 125 %), gruels made using CM and CMI process combinations, and prepared at a suitable consistency, had an ED close to or above 84 kcal/ 100 g of sweetened gruel, the minimum value required for complementary food.

30|$|In our {{previous}} study (Hussain et al. 2015 a) using packed bed bioreactor, {{we found that}} at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> process lag phase (an adaptation phase) time is more at a lower flow rate and less at higher flow rate. The presence of lag phase is the indication of concentration gradient around the surface and within the beads that can be controlled by the optimized flow of the fluid medium. In SCBBR, no lag phase was found due to efficient mixing or mass transfer and less concentration gradient {{to such an extent}} to induce the lag phase. In SCBBR pH and temperature are controlled by complete mixing with the help of agitation. Consequently, the hydrodynamics of the broth in and around the basket shows an important effect on the mass transfer processes involved in substrate conversion. The basket has the advantage of permitting greater contact between reactants and biocatalyst, which in turn increases the reaction rate and efficiency of bio-catalytic reaction and the bio-catalyst is separated from the reaction mixture simply by draining the circulating liquid (Baltaru et al. 2009).|$|R

30|$|In {{homogeneous}} catalytic reaction, {{mass transfer}} effect is considered as negligible because reactant (glucose) and catalysts are in one phase while in heterogeneous, both are in different phases. The catalyst normally is in solid phase and reactants are in liquid phase {{and the reaction}} {{is dependent on the}} mass transfer (Klaewkla et al. 2011), meaning that reaction only takes place when reactants are transferred to the catalytic reaction site by diffusing across external fluid layer around the catalyst (external mass transfer) into pores within catalyst (Internal mass transfer). In heterogeneous reaction, improvement of mass transfer and elimination of limitations are desired objectives (Salmon and Robertson 1987). In this research, our purpose was to understand the mechanism of internal mass transfer effect on immobilized system used for ethanol production and the performance of packed bed bioreactor. Internal mass transfer resistance is strongly depended on these parameters: glucose concentration in the medium, coating on alginate beads (chitosan and non-chitosan coated beads), flow rate and size of beads. However, it can also be compensated to a certain extent, by varying the above mentioned parameters and its effect can be observed on lag phase at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>fermentation,</b> consumption <b>of</b> glucose in medium and production of ethanol.|$|R

30|$|The {{impact of}} pH coupled to process {{design for the}} {{conversion}} of the energy crop Arundo donax to ethanol was assessed in the present study under industrially relevant solids loadings. Two main process strategies were investigated, i.e. the traditional simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) and a HYBRID design, where a long high temperature enzymatic hydrolysis step was carried out prior to continued low temperature SSCF, keeping the same total reaction time. Since acetic acid was identified as the major inhibitor in the slurry, the scenarios were investigated under different fermentation pH in order to alleviate the inhibitory effect on, in particular, xylose conversion. The results show that, regardless <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> pH, a higher glucan conversion could be achieved with the HYBRID approach compared to SSCF. Furthermore, it was found that increasing the pH from 5.0 to 5.5 for the fermentation phase had a large positive effect on xylose consumption for both process designs, although the SSCF design was more favored. With the high sugar concentrations available at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> during the HYBRID design, the ethanol yield was reduced in favor of cell growth and glycerol production. This finding was confirmed in shake flask fermentations where an increase in pH enhanced both glucose and xylose consumption, but also cell growth and cell yield with the overall effect being a reduced ethanol yield. In conclusion this resulted in similar overall ethanol yields at the different pH values for the HYBRID design, despite the improved xylose uptake, whereas a significant increase in overall ethanol yield was found with the SSCF design.|$|R

In this case, first resistance issue is the fluid film around matrix surface and its thickness which depends on various physical properties of the fluid, i.e., substrate concentration and velocity of the fluid (8). Higher substrate concentration can raise concentration gradient difference between the bulk liquid and interior surface of beads possibly causing inhibition of substrate. Warnock et al.

50|$|Today's {{winemaking}} {{for both}} traditionalists and modernists include strict hygiene controls {{and the use}} of some modern winemaking equipment. Rather than fall into one hardline camp or the other, many producers take a middle ground approach that utilizes some modernist techniques along with traditional winemaking. In general, the traditional approach to Nebbiolo involves long maceration periods of 20 to 30 days {{and the use of}} older large botti size barrels. The modern approach to Nebbiolo utilizes shorter maceration periods of 7 to 10 days and cooler fermentation temperatures between 82 and 86 F that preserve fruit flavors and aromas. Towards the end <b>of</b> the <b>fermentation</b> period, the cellars are often heated to encourage the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> malolactic <b>fermentation</b> which softens some of Nebbiolo's harsh acidity. Modern winemakers tend to favor smaller barrels of new oak that need only a couple years to soften the tannic grip of the wines. As new oak imparts notes of vanilla, {{it has the potential to}} cover up the characteristic rose notes of Nebbiolo.|$|R
40|$|Whole-plant corn silages {{were treated}} with Ecosyl® or Foraform® in one trial and Biomate® or Biomate + Cold-flo® in the second trial. In both trials, the silages were well preserved, but all were highly {{unstable}} in air during the first 3 to 4 weeks of the feed-out period. Foraform-treated silage was 2 to 6 degrees F cooler than its control, but Cold-flo-treated silage was 2 to 8 degrees F warmer during the first 10 days post-filling. Laboratory silo results showed that both control silages fermented extremely fast; however, inoculated silages had slightly lower pH and higher lactic acid values through the first 4 to 7 days postfilling. Foraform lowered the initial pH of the ensiled material, restricted subsequent fermentation, and produced a silage with about one-half the acid content compared to its control. Cold-flo raised the initial pH and delayed the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>fermentation,</b> but resulted in a silage with greater acid content and an increased dry matter loss. Though not significant, calves fed Ecosyl, Foraform, and Biomate silages had about 6 percent better feed conversion than those fed control silages and gain per ton of crop ensiled was also higher for the three treated silages. Cold-flo-treated silage produced 3. 5 lb less gain per ton of crop ensiled than its control. Whole-plant forage sorghums {{were treated with}} TriLac® in one trial and Silagest® in the second trial. Inoculated silages had slightly lower ensiling temperatures than controls. All silages fermented rapidly, but both inoculants increased ensiling efficiency as indicated by higher lactic to acetic acid ratios (in laboratory silos) and decreased dry matter losses (in farm-scale silos). Calves fed Silagest silage outperformed those fed control silages, and both inoculants increased gain per ton of crop ensiled over control silages...|$|R
30|$|The <b>fermentations</b> <b>of</b> {{the design}} {{were carried out}} in stirred flasks {{containing}} 200  mL of culture medium in duplicate. The temperature was 30  °C and the stirring speed was 200  rpm; Tween 20 (0.01 %) was added to each flask to improve the emulsification of the oil. The pH was adjusted to 6.0 with sodium hydroxide at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fermentation.</b> The inoculum consisted of a preculture of Y. lipolytica in YEPD medium, of which we added a volume corresponding to 10 % <b>of</b> the total <b>fermentation</b> volume. The cells of this culture were harvested in the period between the first third {{and the end of}} the exponential growth phase. We took samples every 8  h and we measured the enzymatic activity of lipases and the biomass. These measurements were performed in triplicate. The growth kinetics and the enzyme production of each data point were estimated from the average of the results of these three measurements for every treatment (data not shown). Data analysis was performed using JMP statistical software v. 5.0. 1.2 (SAS Institute 2015) to determine which factors influence the production of lipases and how they do it.|$|R
40|$|Background   Information {{about the}} extent of {{carbohydrate}} digestion and fermentation is critical to our ability to explore the metabolic effects <b>of</b> carbohydrate <b>fermentation</b> in vivo. We used cooked 13 C-labelled barley kernels, which are rich in indigestible carbohydrates, to develop a method which makes it possible to distinguish between and to assess carbohydrate digestion and fermentation. Materials and methods   Seventeen volunteers ingested 86 g (dry weight) of cooked naturally 13 C enriched barley kernels after an overnight fast. 13 CO 2 and H 2 in breath samples were measured every half hour for 12 h. The data of 13 CO 2 in breath before the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fermentation</b> were used to fit the curve representing the digestion phase. The difference between the area under curve (AUC) of the fitted digestion curve and the AUC of the observed curve was regarded to represent the fermentation part. Different approaches were applied to determine the proportion of the 13 C-dose available for digestion and fermentation. Results   Four hours after intake of barley, H 2 -excretion in breath started to rise. Within 12 h, 24 – 48...|$|R
50|$|Sour mash is {{a process}} used in the distilling {{industry}} that uses material from an older batch <b>of</b> mash to <b>start</b> the <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> a new batch, analogous to the making sourdough bread with a starter. The term sour mash {{can also be used}} as the name of the type of mash used in that process, and a whiskey made using this process can be referred to as a sour mash whiskey. Sour mash does not refer to the flavor of the whiskey, as is sometimes thought.|$|R
40|$|Limited {{information}} {{is available on the}} impact of the NaOH treatment on table olive fermentations, and for this reason a polyphasic approach has been adopted here to investigate its effect on the fermentation dynamics and bacterial biodiversity. The microbial counts of the main groups involved in the transformation have not shown any differences, apart from a more prompt <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fermentation</b> when the olives were subjected to the NaOH treatment. The data produced by culture-independent analyses highlighted that the <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> table olives not treated with NaOH {{is the result of the}} coexistence of two different ecosystems: the surface of the olives and the brines. A sodium hydroxide treatment not only eliminates this difference, but also affects the bacterial ecology of the olives to a great extent. As proved by high-throughput sequencing, the <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> the olives not treated with NaOH was characterized by the presence of halophilic bacteria, which were substituted by Lactobacillus at the later stages <b>of</b> the <b>fermentation,</b> while enterobacteria were dominant when the olives were treated with sodium hydroxide. Higher biodiversity was found for Lactobacillus plantarum isolated during untreated fermentation. Different biotypes were found on the olive surface and in the brines. When the debittering process was carried out, a decrease in the number of L. plantarum biotypes were observed and those originating from the surface of the olive did not differentiate from the ones present in the brines...|$|R
25|$|Advances in {{viticulture}} {{have helped}} {{to bridge the gap}} between modern and traditional producers. Better canopy management and yield control have led to riper grapes being harvested earlier with more developed tannins in the grape skins. , winemaking for both traditionalist and modernist Barolo producers includes strict hygiene controls and the use of some modern winemaking equipment such as temperature-control fermentation vessels.
