50|$|The closure is {{supplied}} to the bottler with an aluminum foil layer liner already inserted. Although {{there are various}} liners to choose from, a typical induction liner is multi-layered. The top layer is a paper pulp that is generally spot-glued to the cap. The next layer is wax {{that is used to}} bond a layer of aluminum foil to the pulp. The bottom layer is a polymer film laminated to the foil. After the cap or closure is applied, the container passes under an induction coil, which emits an oscillating electromagnetic field. As the container passes under the induction coil (sealing head) the conductive aluminum foil liner begins to heat due to eddy currents. The heat melts the wax, which is absorbed into the pulp backing and releases the foil from the cap. The polymer film also heats and flows onto the lip of the container. When cooled, the polymer creates a bond with the container resulting in a hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>product.</b> Neither the container nor its contents are negatively affected; The heat generated does not harm the contents.|$|E

A negative control may be prepared by pre-incubating the medium, or by aseptically transferring medium into a separate suitable sterile container and incubating the control simultaneously with the media fill test containers. The controls should be incubated under the same conditions as the media fill containers (EN ISO 14644 1 Cleanroom and associated controlled environments Part 1 classification of air cleanliness). Positive control test and growth promotion testing of the medium are usually performed by a commercial vendor or microbiology department of the hospital. In any case, inoculation of the positive control container is always performed in an area separated from the critical manufacturing area.|$|E

40|$|The {{dispute in}} EC – <b>Seal</b> <b>Products</b> raises {{fundamental}} {{questions about the}} relationship between public morals and international trade.

The dispute was filed in 2009 by Canada and Norway against the EU, which in the same year had banned <b>seal</b> <b>products</b> from being imported and placed on its market. According to the EU, the policy was introduced in response to European moral outrage at the inhumane killing of seals. The EU seal regime included a series of exceptions. In particular, it allowed imports of <b>seal</b> <b>products</b> hunted by Inuit or other indigenous communities, as well as imports of <b>seal</b> <b>products</b> processed and re-exported by EU producers.

40|$|To {{what extent}} does the legal {{framework}} of the World Trade Organization (WTO) permit trade restrictions that, at least in part, express the moral beliefs of particular societies and have a root in noninstrumental morality?

While the WTO dispute settlement system is no stranger to cases regarding the treatment of animals, the policies at issue in earlier cases related to objectives-such as conservation of exhaustible natural resources that are anchored in environmental science and international policy, or that are related instrumentally to the protection of human life and health or economic interests. The EU <b>seal</b> <b>products</b> ban is in part aimed instrumentally at improving animal health and welfare, but it is also based on a level of protection for the animals in question that is grounded in the community 2 ̆ 7 s ethical beliefs about the nature of cruelty and the unacceptability of consumption behavior that is complicit with that cruelty...|$|R
40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} drive towards {{improvements}} and achieving success in effective and long term sealing of portland cement concrete pavement contraction joints. A variety of joint <b>sealing</b> <b>products</b> and procedures have been applied in Iowa in search of improvements in seal performance.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the relationship between the}} law of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and morally motivated legislation of the WTO 2 ̆ 7 s Member states. Building on our 2012 article entitled Permitting Pluralism, we argue that the WTO should adopt a pluralistic approach to morally motivated legislation of its Member states. That is, WTO law should allow the greatest latitude possible for states to adopt morally motivated legislation, and should permit all types of moral and religious reasons for restricting international trade, including non-instrumental moral reasons. The WTO should not attempt to second-guess the moral and religious commitments of its Members, and it should permit morally complex legislation, involving trade-offs and multiple, possibly competing, motivations. Instead the WTO should confine its role to a thorough analysis of any discriminatory aspects of the measure to determine whether the measure is protectionist. This approach is justified by the WTO 2 ̆ 7 s institutional capacity and purpose, when understood in historical context. After articulating this pluralist approach, we analyze the recent EC - <b>Seal</b> <b>Products</b> dispute at the WTO, a watershed WTO case on morally motivated domestic legislation, to determine whether the WTO 2 ̆ 7 s adjudicatory bodies adopted an appropriate attitude to the European Union 2 ̆ 7 s legislation banning the importation of <b>seal</b> <b>products</b> for explicitly moral reasons, out of concern for animal welfare. We argue that the <b>Seal</b> <b>Products</b> case largely followed our pluralist approach, adapting the law of the WTO to accommodate non-instrumental moral reasons for regulating by WTO Member states. Finally, we defend the <b>Seal</b> <b>Products</b> decision against criticisms that have emerged in the scholarly literature, including those that have criticized our pluralistic approach to morally motivated legislation...|$|R

40|$|Since 1972 {{restrictions}} {{arising from}} the United States Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) have seriously hampered efforts to develop commercial markets for <b>seal</b> <b>products</b> to the United States, and other international markets influenced by the MMPA. This has resulted in significant negative economic impacts {{on the east coast}} Canadian seal fishery. The exemption of harp <b>seal</b> <b>products</b> from the restrictive grip of the MMPA is critical if the United States market for <b>seal</b> <b>products</b> is to be effectively developed. It is anticipated that access to the United States market would present new market opportunities for the sealing industry, particularly in the fur and neutraceutical sectors. The U. S. 'health food' sector alone is estimated to be worth $ 80 billion per year (Ho, 2003). This market includes all omega-three, oil based concentrates and a full range of herbal and homeopathic remedies purchased through the health food system. [...] There is limited historical United States market data for <b>seal</b> <b>products,</b> as <b>seal</b> <b>products</b> impacted by 'MMPA' have not been exported to that market since the early 1970 's. Therefore, to evaluate market potential, this report establishes linkages using similar products in the categories of other furs and marine oils. The potential American market for fashion fur items is significant, with United States fur sales of $ 1. 53 billion reported in 2002. ([URL] These strong market indicators might present an opportunity for the Canadian sealing industry, should the American market become accessible.
