5|$|Player {{controls}} include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, firing torpedoes, and hyperspace. Initially {{these were}} controlled using the front-panel test <b>switches</b> on the PDP-1 minicomputer, with four <b>switches</b> for each player, but these {{proved to be}} awkward to use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power <b>switches.</b> The location of the <b>switches</b> also left one player {{off to one side}} of the CRT display due to the limited space in front of the computer, which left them at a disadvantage. To alleviate these problems, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. The gamepad had a switch for turning left or right, another for forward thrust or hyperspace, and a torpedo launch button. The button was silent so that the opposing player would not have a warning that the player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a cooldown period.|$|E
