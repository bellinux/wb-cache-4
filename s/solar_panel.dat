5|$|The REVA NXR {{exhibited}} in the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and the Nissan Leaf SV trim both have roof-mounted solar panels. These solar panels are designed to trickle charge the batteries when the car is moving or parked. Another proposed technology is REVive, by Reva. When the REVA NXR's batteries are running low or are fully depleted, the driver is able to send an SMS to REVive and unlock a hidden reserve in the battery pack. Reva has not provided details on how the system will work. The Fisker Karma uses <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> in the roof to recharge the 12-volt lead-acid accessory battery. The Nissan Leaf SL trim also has a small <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> {{at the rear of}} the roof/spoiler that can trickle charge the auxiliary 12-volt lead-acid battery.|$|E
5|$|By 2009, Purina {{was one of}} Nestlé's {{fastest growing}} divisions, due to an {{increasing}} willingness by consumers {{to spend more money}} on petcare. In 2008, it formed a separate company called PurinaCare with headquarters in San Antonio, Texas that sold pet insurance. PetCare was later acquired by Pethealth Inc. in 2013. By 2009 Purina had also introduced pet litter products and built new manufacturing facilities in Russia and Thailand. Its Colorado plant built the largest privately owned <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> system in the state. In September 2010, Nestlé reached an agreement to acquire Waggin' Train, a producer of pet treats with $200 million in annual revenues.|$|E

My {{goal was to}} take a look at <b>Solar</b> <b>panels</b> from the past as well as <b>Solar</b> <b>panels</b> from the present and see what kind of {{differences}} there are. <b>Solar</b> <b>panels</b> have changed over the years. Although <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> are not new, the use of them has been slow due to cost. <b>Solar</b> <b>panels</b> are a great energy source that is almost unlimited.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the interest for <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> as a standardised catalogue option for new houses. A survey done by SIFO from August 2013 {{shows that there}} is a large interest for <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> amongst house owners in Sweden. In California construction companies have started offering <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> to their house buyers as a standardised option. This study examines if a similar model may be applied here in Sweden. The thesis starts with a literature study on <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> regarding technique, development, utilization and history. Then the laws, regulations and grants and such regarding <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> will be clarified. With this as groundwork the interest among the queue for lots in Lunds municipality through a web based survey will be examined. Thereafter the interest amongst construction companies will also be examined through a web based survey. The gathered data is presented with diagrams and charts. Finally the collected data will be summarized and analyzed and the future of <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> in Sweden, especially <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> as a standardised option for new houses, discussed. The study has shown {{that there is a}} big interest among potential house buyers and also among the construction companies for <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> and also for <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> as a standardized option. The probabilities and assumptions that energy prices will rise, system prices for <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> will continue to go down and environmental interest and care will grow lead to the conclusion that {{it is only a matter}} of time until <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> become a standardized option for new houses on the Swedish market. Also that the technical solutions which allows solar cells to be integrated into construction materials would be very fitting as a standardized option...|$|R
50|$|Although the {{vehicles}} were electric and had <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> on the roof, propulsion was not {{powered by the}} <b>solar</b> <b>panels</b> but by the original vehicle's batteries which were charged at power outlets or, when no power outlet was available, by generators.

5|$|Due {{to their}} {{location}} near the beachfront, the station roof's solar panels {{needed to meet}} stringent hurricane standards, and as such, the panels for the station were rigorously tested in a laboratory in York, Pennsylvania. It is the New York City Subway's first solar-powered subway station. The solar panels are expected to last for at least 35 years, and a catwalk is located below the roof if any <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> replacements were ever needed. As a bonus feature, a low voltage current, which is emitted from the panels, serves as a deterrent against pigeons.|$|E
