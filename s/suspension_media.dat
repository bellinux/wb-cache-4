40|$|Microorganisms are {{essential}} regulators of soil functioning, {{as they are}} involved in many crucial processes such as organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling, soil structure and fertility. Currently, there is a growing interest in functional diversity, such as the number and type of substrates used for energy metabolism (CLPP-community level physiological profiling). Such metabolic diversity of heterotroph soil bacteria is frequently investigated through Biolog Ecoplates, containing 31 of the most useful carbon sources for the soil community. The metabolic diversity of soil bacteria might be an interesting biological indicator of soil quality, and also a useful tool for investigating the link between land use change, climate warming, soil carbon, microbial diversity and activity. Methods related to Biolog-CLPP reported in the literature differ in the suspension medium and extraction method, the type and density of inoculums, the inoculation procedures and conditions of incubations. For example, various combinations of extraction methods and <b>suspension</b> <b>media</b> are being used for the first bacterial extraction step. Despite such methodological differences, Biolog-CLPP data are often compared across studies. The development of a standardised method for Biolog-CLPP is however essential improving the relevance and significance of results across studies.

The microbial extraction efficiency was tested by plate counts for a total of twelve combinations of three <b>suspension</b> <b>media</b> and four extraction methods.

Bacterial cells (approximately 10 (10) cells per ml) suspended in 0. 02 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6. 8) caused the clumping of standard fibronectin, collagen, gelatin, and fibrinogen latex suspensions within 2 min on glass slides.

Methods and Results: A plasma discharge was generated between two circular aluminium electrodes at 40 kV. E. coli suspensions (10 ^ 7 CFU/ml) in either maximum recovery diluent (MRD) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were treated in a 96 -well microtitre plate inside a sealed package. The effects of treatment time, post-treatment storage time, either direct or indirect samples exposure to the plasma discharge and <b>suspension</b> <b>media</b> were studied. Regardless of the media tested, 20 s of direct and 45 s of indirect plasma treatment resulted in complete bacterial inactivation (7 log CFU/ml).

For both genotypes somatic embryos were obtained in both MS based liquid and semisolid media with or without 50 and 100 mM NaCl.

Current drug treatments have limited effectiveness in improving symptoms. Celavie Biosciences LLC has developed a human fetal brain-derived, pluripotent, nontumorigenic, hypoimmunogenic stem cell line with a normal karyotype (hfSC) that has previously shown an ability to migrate, differentiate and reduce structural and functional deficits in other neurodegenerative animal models. In this study, I examined if injected hfSCs into male Wistar rat CA 3 hippocampal lesions will survive and possibly differentiate into mature pyramidal neurons, thereby diminishing neuronal damage. It has been established that the CA 3 region of the hippocampus is involved in consolidating short-term memory to long-term memory and in spatial navigation. I stereotactically lesioned the CA 3 regions at 50 days bilaterally with the neurotoxin NMDA (1 ??l containing 7. 5 mg/ml; - 3. 5 mm AP; ?? 2. 0 L and - 2. 5 V).
