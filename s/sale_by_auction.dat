5|$|In March 1954, Air Kruise {{applied for}} {{permission}} to operate Dakotas on routes between Lympne and Le Touquet, Calais and Ostend. On 29 April, the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation offered Lympne for <b>sale</b> <b>by</b> <b>auction</b> in London. Bidding reached £88,000 but the reserve was £100,000 and the airport was not sold. On 28 August, Silver City Airways trialled a Westland-Sikorsky WS-51 helicopter on cross-Channel flights. Permission had been granted {{for the use of}} these aircraft for freight operations and it was intended to introduce them on 1 April 1955. On 3 October, Silver City Airways operated their last flight out of Lympne as operations were being transferred to the new Lydd (Ferryfield) Airport which had opened on 6 July 1954. A total of 33,487 car ferry flights had been made from Lympne since the service had started in 1948. As of 1 November, Lympne closed as a public airport, although private flying was allowed as long as no passengers were carried for hire or reward.|$|E
25|$|Because of his {{involvement}} in this litigation and in arranging for the <b>sale</b> <b>by</b> <b>auction</b> of his prizes and their cargoes, Ordronaux was inactive as a privateer for approximately the next twelve months. The sale of Concord alone raised the sum of $24,409. This was shared between her owners and each named member of her crew in proportions given in the surviving court documents. But most significantly, Ordronaux now had sufficient funds to buy a ship of his own.|$|E
25|$|Carthage {{also sent}} caravans into the {{interior}} of Africa and Persia. It traded its manufactured and agricultural goods to the coastal and interior peoples of Africa for salt, gold, timber, ivory, ebony, apes, peacocks, skins, and hides. Its merchants invented the practice of <b>sale</b> <b>by</b> <b>auction</b> {{and used it to}} trade with the African tribes. In other ports, they tried to establish permanent warehouses or sell their goods in open-air markets. They obtained amber from Scandinavia, and from the Celtiberians, Gauls, and Celts they got amber, tin, silver, and furs. Sardinia and Corsica produced gold and silver for Carthage, and Phoenician settlements on islands such as Malta and the Balearic Islands produced commodities that would be sent back to Carthage for large-scale distribution. The city supplied poorer civilizations with simple products such as pottery, metallic objects, and ornamentations, often displacing the local manufacturing, but brought its best works to wealthier ones such as the Greeks and Etruscans. Carthage traded in almost every commodity wanted by the ancient world, including spices from Arabia, Africa and India, and slaves (the empire of Carthage temporarily held a portion of Europe and sent conquered barbarian warriors into Northern African slavery).|$|E

500|$|Another form of wife selling was by deed of conveyance. Although {{initially}} {{much less}} common than <b>sale</b> <b>by</b> <b>auction,</b> the practice became more widespread after the 1850s, as popular opinion {{turned against the}} market sale of a wife. The issue of the commonly perceived legitimacy of wife selling was also brought to the government. In 1881, Home Secretary William Harcourt was asked to comment on an incident in Sheffield, in which a man sold his wife for a quart of beer. Harcourt replied: [...] "no impression exists anywhere in England that the selling of wives is legitimate", and [...] "that no such practice as wife selling exists", but as late as 1889, {{a member of the}} Salvation Army sold his wife for a shilling in Hucknall Torkard, Nottinghamshire, and subsequently led her by the halter to her buyer's house, the last case in which the use of a halter is mentioned. The most recent case of an English wife sale was reported in 1913, when a woman giving evidence in a Leeds police court during a maintenance case claimed that her husband had sold her to one of his workmates for £1 (equivalent to about £ in [...] ). The manner of her sale is unrecorded.|$|E
500|$|In 1985 Randall H. Langer, a young {{real estate}} {{developer}} active in apartment rehabilitation in the neighborhood, aided {{the creation of a}} local historic district, the Sheridan Park Historic District, which critics charged was of dubious historical value and created to facilitate gentrification. Nineteen tax delinquent properties in Uptown were offered for <b>sale</b> <b>by</b> <b>auction</b> by Cook County in Fall, 1987. Since 1983 Cook County had a program to afford local governments the opportunity to acquire tax delinquent properties for almost nothing, prior to the county's scavenger sale to the public, if the local government had a specific development plan. On October 28, 1987, Shiller urged the Tax Delinquency Subcommittee of the Cook County Board to accept a no-cash bid from the City for the 19 tax-delinquent parcels in Uptown. A decision was deferred when Commissioner Rosemarie Love requested a delay on grounds that the Washington administration had not provided a development plan. Subcommittee chairman Commissioner Richard Siebel said the County's no-cash sales program was [...] "designed to place property back on the tax rolls as quickly as possible – not for land-banking. It's not appropriate for us to pass this until the city tells us, parcel by parcel, what they intend to do and how they plan to pay for it." [...] Another commissioner noted that the City already owned 7,000 tax-delinquent properties, and another added, [...] "Properties we gave to the city 12 years ago are still war zones. I don't want the same thing to happen here." ...|$|E

50|$|The land grant policy {{changed after}} 1825 as the Upper Canadian {{administration}} faced {{a financial crisis}} that would otherwise require raising local taxes, thereby making it more dependent on a local elected legislature. The Upper Canadian state ended its policy of granting land to “unofficial” settlers and implemented a broad plan of revenue-generating sales. The Crown replaced its old policy of land grants to ordinary settlers in newly opened districts with land <b>sales</b> <b>by</b> <b>auction.</b> It also passed legislation that allowed the auctioning of previously granted land for payment of back-taxes.|$|R

2500|$|Aslacton Mill was {{probably}} built in 1834, {{although there was}} a mill in Aslacton as early as 1751. Benjamin Gibson is the first recorded miller and the mill was owned by Barnabas Burroughes from 1872 until his death on 18 December 1899. The mill passed to his widow and after her death on 4 August 1903, the mill was offered for <b>sale</b> <b>by</b> <b>auction</b> at the Railway Inn, Tivetshall on 25 August 1903. [...] The top bid of £350 was below the reserve price, so the mill remained unsold. The mill was sold in October 1903 to Samuel Fickling. He died in March 1913, leaving the mill to his widow. On her death in May 1915 the mill passed to their son Arthur Robinson Fickling, who sold it to Selina Herring in October 1915 for £400. The mill was sold to John Colchester in 1929. The sails were removed c1930 and the mill worked by steam engine. Colchester worked the mill by steam engine, and then an oil engine, until 1938.

The data obtained from the total 149 timber auctions inthe period 1998 - 2002 were used as material in this study. The effects of seasonal and other factors on the auctionprice of beech timber were investigated by variance analysis, season and month indexes, and correlation,regression and factors analyses respectively. At the end of statistical analyses, it was determined that the seasonsaffected the beech timber prices at the 90 % significant level. The most positive effect in spring and the mostnegative effect in winter were determined. The month most affecting timber price was April. Also, the factorsthe most affecting the price of beech timber <b>sale</b> <b>by</b> <b>auctions</b> were determined as follows: (1) Timing of theauctions, (2) Quantity of supply and size of timber stack, (3) Demand level, (4) Quality and appropriateness tostandardization in timber production.

2500|$|The giant {{trevally}} {{is considered}} one of the top gamefish of the Indo-Pacific region, having outstanding strength, speed and endurance once hooked. It can be taken by many methods, including baits of cut or live fish and squid, as well as a wide array of lures. The species is commonly taken on bibbed plugs, minnows, spoons, jigs and poppers, [...] soft plastic lures and saltwater flies. In recent years, the development of both jigging and surface-popping techniques has seen the giant trevally become an extremely popular candidate for catch and release fishing, with many charter operators based around this concept. The species is also popular with spearfishermen throughout its range. The species' edibility has been rated from poor to excellent by different authors, although numerous cases of ciguatera poisoning have been reported from the species. Detailed tests on a large (1 m) specimen taken from Palmyra Island showed the toxicity of the fish's flesh, liver and washed intestinal tract produced no or weakly positive symptoms to laboratory mice, but the digested contents of the intestine were lethal. The authors argued, based on this test, the flesh of giant trevally was safe to consume. However, analysis of case studies in which ciguatera poisoning was reported after eating the fish suggested an accumulative effect occurs with repeated consumption; and tests like the one outlined above are not reliable, as the toxin appears to be distributed haphazardly throughout each fish. Since 1990, giant trevally taken from the main Hawaiian islands have been blocked from <b>sale</b> <b>by</b> <b>auction</b> internationally due to concerns over liability from ciguatera poisoning.|$|E
