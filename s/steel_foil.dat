50|$|From {{the start}} onwards, {{the issue of}} postage stamps {{balanced}} between two goals, to introduce Bhutan to the world community and to provide revenue, in particular foreign exchange. We will find this reflected in the faces on the stamps: at one side Bhutanese themes and {{at the other side}} typical international thematic and commemorative subjects appealing to the philatelic market. The first stamp manager, Burt Todd, added to the latter goal with great success, and often as world’s first, special materials (<b>steel</b> <b>foil,</b> silk, gold color metal foil, molded plastic), special shapes (round, triangular), special printing (3D) and special effects (perfumed ink, real playable gramophone recordings).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel technique for joining similar and dissimilar metal foils, namely micro clinching with cutting by laser shock forming. A {{series of experiments}} were conducted to study the deformation behavior of single layer material, during which many important process parameters were determined. The process window of the 1060 pure aluminum foils and annealed copper foils produced by micro clinching with cutting was analyzed. Moreover, similar material combination (annealed copper foils) and dissimilar material combination (1060 pure aluminum foils and 304 stainless <b>steel</b> <b>foils)</b> were successfully achieved. The effect of laser energy on the interlock and minimum thickness of upper foils was investigated. In addition, the mechanical strength of different material combinations joined by micro clinching with cutting was measured in single lap shearing tests. According to the achieved results, this novel technique is more suitable for material combinations where the upper foil is thicker than lower foil. With the increase of laser energy, the interlock increased while the minimum thickness of upper foil decreased gradually. The shear strength of 1060 pure aluminum foils and 304 stainless <b>steel</b> <b>foils</b> combination was three times as large as that of 1060 pure aluminum foils and annealed copper foils combination...|$|R
