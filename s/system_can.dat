40|$|A {{framework}} is defined within which reactive <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> be studied formally. The {{framework is}} based upon s-categories, a new variety of categories, within which reactive <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> be set up {{in such a way}} that labelled transition <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> be uniformly extracted. These lead in turn to behavioural preorders and equivalences, such as the failures preorder (treated elsewhere) and bisimilarity, which are guaranteed to be congruential. The theory rests upon the notion of relative pushout previously introduced by the authors. The framewor...|$|R
5000|$|The {{input-output}} {{characteristics of}} discrete-time LTI system are completely described by its impulse response [...]Some {{of the most}} important properties of a system are causality and stability. Unlike CT systems, non-causal DT <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> be realized. It is trivial to make an acausal FIR system causal by adding delays. It is even possible to make acausal IIR <b>systems.</b> Non-stable <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> be built and can be useful in many circumstances. Even non-real <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> be built and are very useful in many contexts.|$|R
5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions in a close binary <b>system</b> <b>can</b> result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters. The total angular momentum {{of the system is}} conserved, but the angular momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.|$|E
5|$|Alterations in the {{autonomic}} nervous <b>system</b> <b>can</b> lead to orthostatic hypotension (low {{blood pressure}} upon standing), oily skin and excessive sweating, urinary incontinence, and altered sexual function. Constipation and impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility) can be {{severe enough to}} cause discomfort and even endanger health. Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and paresthesia (tingling and numbness). All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary <b>system</b> <b>can</b> not yet be ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star. From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E

Optional {{fourth and fifth}} tanks {{can be added to}} act as a reservoir supply, topping up the main tanks during flight, increasing range or endurance. The AW101 can also be outfitted with a probe for aerial refuelling. Self-sealing fuel tanks are an optional item to be selected by the customer. An inlet particle separator <b>system</b> <b>can</b> be installed, protecting the engine when operating in sandy environments.|$|E
5|$|Encrypting File System (EFS) {{may be used}} in {{conjunction}} with BitLocker to provide protection once the operating system is running. Protection of the files from processes and users within the operating <b>system</b> <b>can</b> only be performed using encryption software that operates within Windows, such as EFS. BitLocker and EFS, therefore, offer protection against different classes of attacks.|$|E
5|$|In {{telecommunication}} networks, heterodyning {{is used to}} move {{frequencies of}} individual signals to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television <b>system</b> <b>can</b> carry 500 television channels {{at the same time}} because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. Continuous wave (CW) doppler radar detectors are basically heterodyne detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.|$|E

These run {{as part of}} the normal build process and extensively exercise the interpreter and its core modules. Perl developers rely on the functional tests to ensure that changes to the interpreter do not introduce software bugs; additionally, Perl users who see that the interpreter passes its functional tests on their <b>system</b> <b>can</b> have a high degree of confidence that it is working properly.|$|E
5|$|Red maple is a {{good choice}} of a tree for urban areas when there is ample room for its root system. Forming an {{association}} with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi can help A. rubrum grow along city streets. It is more tolerant of pollution and road salt than Sugar Maples, although the tree's fall foliage is not as vibrant in this environment. Like several other maples, its low root <b>system</b> <b>can</b> be invasive and it makes a poor choice for plantings near paving. It attracts squirrels, who eat its buds in the early spring, although squirrels prefer the larger buds of the silver maple.|$|E
