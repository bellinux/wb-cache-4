Late in 1987 questionnaires were sent to the consultant physicians, geriatricians, and nephrologists who had reported on the 181 patients, asking whether the patient had started receiving dialysis, had received a transplant, or had died.

40|$|Abstract The {{last few}} decades have {{witnessed}} major growth in the evidence base on effective client interven-tions used by social workers and other health and social service professionals. As the pressure for service agencies to offer empirically <b>supported</b> <b>treatments</b> has been increasing, financial and time constraints have driven {{a decline in the}} frequency and amount of supervision pro-vided within many of these organizations. While the reduction in staff supervision presents a challenge for effective implementation of all treatments, there are com-prehensive empirically <b>supported</b> <b>treatment</b> models for clients that serve as exemplars of supervisory practice through their explicit requirements, processes and tools for supervision and supervisor development. After a review of the current status of supervision nationally, an implemen-tation science-based approach is described, which builds organizational support for supervision and promotes opti-mal supervisory practice through training and consultation of supervisors and supervisees. The elements of this comprehensive approach, developed by the Yale Program on Supervision, are detailed. Supervisory policies, prac-tices, and tools created by the developers of empirically <b>supported</b> <b>treatments</b> and similarly grounded in the prin-ciples of implementation science are offered as further examples of strategies for ensuring effective supervision...|$|R
