40|$|The {{portfolio}} of impacts that are quantified in {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) has grown to include rather different stressors than those that were the focus of early LCAs. Some of the newest life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models are still in an early phase of development and {{have not yet been}} included in any LCA study. This is the case for <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> and noise impacts, which have been only recently modeled. <b>Sound</b> <b>emissions</b> are matter-less, time dependent, and bound to the physical properties of waves. The way <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> and the relative noise impacts are modeled in LCA can show how new or existing matter-less impacts can be addressed. In this study, we analyze, through the example of <b>sound</b> <b>emissions,</b> the specific features of a matter-less impact that does not stem from the use of a kilogram of matter, nor is related to the emission of a kilogram of matter. We take as a case study the production of energy by means of wind turbines, contradicting the commonly held assumption that windmills have no emissions during use. We show how to account for <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> in the life cycle inventory phase of the life cycle of a wind turbine and then calculate the relative impacts using a noise LCIA model...|$|R

40|$|The {{hardenability}} {{of steel}} {{through the whole}} workpiece depends on several facts: chemical composition, the type of steel, {{the size and shape}} representing the mass of the workpiece, microstructure prior to heat treatment, the type of quenching medium applied, the quenching method and the quenching process itself. Most common difficulties encountered are caused by deviations due to a vapour film formation around the workpiece. The vapour film formed around the workpiece produces an uneven removal of heat and consequently, a different microstructure than the one expected. In order to control the hardening process, one should be able to monitor the quenching process in real time. The paper treats an experimental setup comprising detection of <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> together with some results obtained in the course of quenching. Due to heat transfer from a specimen to a quenching medium, film boiling and nucleate boiling occur around a heated specimen, which strongly affects sound-pressure signals emitted from the surface during quenching. Different amplitudes of emitted sound-pressure signals at different frequencies therefore mostly depend on the wetting behaviour around the surface of the specimen. It has turned out that an analysis of <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> signals can provide useful information that confirms differences occurring in quenching specimens with different shapes in different quenching media under different quenching conditions.

The paper treats an experimental setup comprising detection of <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> in the course of quenching process. Due to heat transfer from a specimen’s surface to a quenching medium, film boiling and nucleate boiling occur round a heated specimen, which strongly affects quenching. An investigation of <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> in the quenching process was carried out with cylindrical specimens made of chrome-molybdenum heat-treatable steel 42 CrMo 4 quenched in different quenching media.

Analysis of <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> signals can give useful information and confirm the differences caused by different quenching conditions. Analysis of the quenching results obtained from sound-emission signals during the quenching process can be confirmed by variations of residual stresses and hardness in the cross section.

40|$|Hypothesis: Acoustical {{measurements}} can be {{used for}} functional control of a direct acoustic cochlear stimulator (DACS). Background: The DACS is a recently released active hearing implant that works on the principle of a conventional piston prosthesis driven by the rod of an electromagnetic actuator. An inherent part of the DACS actuator is a thin titanium diaphragm that allows for movement of the stimulation rod while hermetically sealing the housing. In addition to mechanical stimulation, the actuator emits sound into the mastoid cavity because of the motion of the diaphragm. Methods: We investigated the use of the <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> of a DACS for intra-operative testing. We measured <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> in the external auditory canal (PEAC) and velocity of the actuators stimulation rod (Vact) in five implanted ears of whole-head specimens.

Results: <b>Sound</b> <b>emission</b> of the DACS with a signal-to-noise ratio > 10 dB was observed between 0. 5 and 5 kHz.

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} mechanisms {{responsible for}} the production of noise present in the flow field around the Hubco A-bar roof rack have been investigated experimentally. The frequency spectra of <b>sound</b> <b>emissions</b> were determined using sound measurement equipment in the field and in a specially designed low noise wind tunnel. Flow visualisation and hotwire anemometry techniques were also used to establish a model of the flow around the roof rack. Correlation was drawn between flow phenomena and <b>sound</b> <b>emissions.</b> The source of the annoying tonal emission was established to be a periodic vortex shedding from the trailing edge of the aerofoil shaped profile. Treatments to reduce or eliminate this <b>sound</b> <b>emission</b> were developed, based upon changing the flow pattern {{across the surface of the}} roof rack. The generation of chordwise trailing vortices near the leading edge of the A-bar was found to be effective in noise abatement by disturbing the formation of the regular vortex street. These chordwise vortices may also break up the spanwise correlation of the periodic wake reducing the strength of the noise emission. Chordwise vortices are generated by installation of cross flow inducing obstructions such as cylinders, hemispheres, serrations and diagonal steps near the leading edge.
