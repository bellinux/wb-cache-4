50|$|British, German, other {{national}} and international test codes are used to standardize the procedures and definitions used to test <b>steam</b> <b>turbines.</b> Selection of the test code to be used is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, and has some significance {{to the design of}} the turbine and associated systems. In the United States, ASME has produced several performance test codes on <b>steam</b> <b>turbines.</b> These include ASME PTC 6-2004, <b>Steam</b> <b>Turbines,</b> ASME PTC 6.2-2011, <b>Steam</b> <b>Turbines</b> in Combined Cycles, PTC 6S-1988, Procedures for Routine Performance Test of <b>Steam</b> <b>Turbines.</b> These ASME performance test codes have gained international recognition and acceptance for testing <b>steam</b> <b>turbines.</b> The single most important and differentiating characteristic of ASME performance test codes, including PTC 6, is that the test uncertainty of the measurement indicates the quality of the test and is not {{to be used as a}} commercial tolerance.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>turbines</b> {{also had}} capital cost and {{operating}} advantages over reciprocating engines. The condensate from steam engines was contaminated {{with oil and}} could not be reused, while condensate from a turbine is clean and typically reused. [...] <b>Steam</b> <b>turbines</b> were a fraction of the size and weight of comparably rated reciprocating <b>steam</b> engine. <b>Steam</b> <b>turbines</b> can operate for years with almost no wear. Reciprocating steam engines required high maintenance. [...] <b>Steam</b> <b>turbines</b> can be manufactured with capacities far larger than any steam engines ever made, giving important economies of scale.|$|R

5|$|While GE had {{initially}} hoped {{to deliver a}} prototype <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> locomotive to UP in 1937, none were completed until December 1938, which were then delivered for testing in spring 1939. In total, the two prototype locomotives had taken almost two years to complete.|$|E
50|$|The final major {{evolution}} of the steam engine design {{was the use of}} <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> starting in the late part of the 19th century. <b>Steam</b> <b>turbines</b> are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines (for outputs above several hundred horsepower), have fewer moving parts, and provide rotary power directly instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means. <b>Steam</b> <b>turbines</b> virtually replaced reciprocating engines in electricity generating stations early in the 20th century, where their efficiency, higher speed appropriate to generator service, and smooth rotation were advantages. Today most electric power is provided by <b>steam</b> <b>turbines.</b> In the United States 90% of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources. <b>Steam</b> <b>turbines</b> were extensively applied for propulsion of large ships throughout most of the 20th century.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>turbines</b> It {{has been}} {{proposed}} [...] that <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> be used to convert {{the heat from the}} fusion chamber into electricity. The heat is transferred into a working fluid that turns into steam, driving electric generators.|$|R

5|$|The Mahans {{featured}} improvements over previous destroyers, with 12 torpedo tubes, superimposed gun shelters, and generators {{for emergency}} use. Standard displacement increased from 1,365 tons to 1,500 tons. The class {{introduced a new}} steam propulsion system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with {{a new type of}} lightweight <b>steam</b> <b>turbine,</b> proving simpler and more efficient than the Mahans' predecessors—so much so that it was used on many subsequent wartime US destroyers.|$|E
5|$|The final {{evolution}} of ironclad propulsion was {{the adoption of}} the triple-expansion steam engine, a further refinement which was first adopted in , laid down in 1885 and commissioned in 1891. Many ships also used a forced draught to get additional power from their engines, and this system was widely used until the introduction of the <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> in the mid-1900s (decade).|$|E

A winch used to move railway wagons at Hemyock Dairy near Wellington was built by J. Lynn of Sunderland. There is a runnable Crossley diesel engine dating from 1935. There is a Spirax Sarco 'Ogden pump' used to pump condensate from steam lines. The collection includes the boiler which powered the Telescopic Bridge, Bridgwater.|$|E

5|$|Arthur William Radford {{was born}} on 27 February 1896 in Chicago, to John Arthur Radford, a Canadian-born {{electrical}} engineer, and Agnes Eliza Radford (née Knight). The eldest of four children, he was described as bright and energetic in his youth. When Arthur {{was six years old}} the family moved to Riverside, Illinois, where his father {{took a job as a}} managing engineer with Commonwealth Edison Company. John Radford managed the first <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> engines in the United States, at the Fisk Street Generating Station.|$|E
5|$|One {{alternative}} was the turbo-electric drive where the <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> generated electrical power which then drove the propellers. This was particularly favoured by the US Navy, which {{used it for}} all dreadnoughts from late 1915–1922. The advantages of this method were its low cost, the opportunity for very close underwater compartmentalization, and good astern performance. The disadvantages were that the machinery was heavy and vulnerable to battle damage, particularly the effects of flooding on the electrics.|$|E
5|$|The nominal 250 MW solar {{electric}} generating facility generates steam {{in solar}} steam generators, which will expand through a <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> generator to produce electrical power from twin, independently operable solar fields, each feeding a 125 MW power island. The plant should generate 617,000 MWh of power annually, enough power {{for more than}} 88,000 households and will prevent the emission of over 430 kilotons of CO2 a year. Pacific Gas & Electric has agreed to a 25-year power purchase agreement.|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{generation}} was the sector {{with the highest}} productivity growth in the U.S. {{in the early twentieth}} century.

5|$|Trough systems {{convert the}} heat from the sun into electricity. Because of their {{parabolic}} shape, trough collectors can focus the sun at 30-60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the focal line of the trough. Synthetic oil circulates through the pipe and captures this heat, reaching temperatures of 390°C (735°F). The hot oil is pumped to a generating station and routed through a heat exchanger to produce steam. Finally, electricity is produced in a conventional <b>steam</b> <b>turbine.</b> The SEGS plants operate on natural gas on cloudy days or after dark, and natural gas provides 25% of the total output.|$|E
5|$|Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (Wadzek's Struggle {{with the}} <b>Steam</b> <b>Turbine)</b> is a 1918 comic novel by the German author Alfred Döblin. Set in Berlin, it narrates the futile and often {{delusional}} {{struggle of the}} eponymous industrialist Wadzek against Rommel, his more powerful competitor. In its narrative technique and its refusal to psychologize its characters, {{as well as in}} its vivid evocations of Berlin as a modern metropolis, Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine has been read as a precursor to Döblin's better-known 1929 novel Berlin Alexanderplatz.|$|E
5|$|The <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> {{section of}} a power plant, the turbine hall, {{generally}} costs about $1/W, and the electrical equipment to feed that power to the grid is about another $1/W. To reach the projected total CAPEX quoted in LIFE documents, this implies that the entire nuclear island has to cost around $4/W for LIFE.2, and just over $2/W for LIFE.3. Modern nuclear plants, benefiting from decades of commercial experience and continuous design work, cost just under $8/W, with approximately half {{of that in the}} nuclear island. LLNL's estimates require LIFE.3 to be built in 2040 for about half the cost of a fission plant today.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{the rest}} of the Tucker-class ships—which had differing {{arrangements}} of <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> and reciprocating engines for cruising—Wadsworth was designed with what became the main United States prototype installation of her two Curtis geared <b>steam</b> <b>turbines.</b> According to Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906–1921, the mechanical design for Wadsworth had a [...] "considerable effect" [...] on post-1915 U.S. destroyer designs.

50|$|Electrical power {{stations}} use large <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> driving electric generators to produce most (about 80%) of the world's electricity. The advent of large <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> made central-station electricity generation practical, since reciprocating steam engines of large rating became very bulky, and operated at slow speeds. Most central stations are fossil fuel {{power plants and}} nuclear power plants; some installations use geothermal steam, or use concentrated solar power (CSP) to create the <b>steam.</b> <b>Steam</b> <b>turbines</b> {{can also be used}} directly to drive large centrifugal pumps, such as feedwater pumps at a thermal power plant.|$|R
5|$|Construction of {{the first}} phase, the A Station, began in March 1929. The main {{building}} work {{was carried out by}} John Mowlem & Co, and the structural steelwork erection carried out by Sir William Arrol & Co. Other contractors were employed for specialist tasks. Most of the electrical equipment, including the <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> turbo generators, was produced by Metropolitan-Vickers in Trafford Park, Manchester. The building of the steel frame began in October 1930. Once completed, the construction of the brick cladding began, in March 1931. Until the construction of the B Station, the eastern wall of the boiler house was clad in corrugated metal sheeting as a temporary enclosure. The A Station first generated electricity in 1933, but was not completed until 1935. The total cost of its construction was £2,141,550. Between construction beginning in 1929 and 1933, there were six fatal and 121 non-fatal accidents on the site.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{power is}} usually {{generated}} by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or {{from other sources}} such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric {{power in the world}} using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention {{in the late nineteenth century}} of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.|$|E
5|$|Firedrake, {{the sixth}} ship {{of her name}} in the Royal Navy, was built by Parsons Marine <b>Steam</b> <b>Turbine</b> Company, Wallsend, {{although}} her hull was sub-contracted to Vickers Armstrongs. She was laid down at their Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne shipyard on 5 July, launched on 28 June 1934, {{the same day as}} her sister ship, , and completed on 30 April 1935. The ship cost 243,966 pounds, excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament. Firedrake was initially assigned to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet, but was sent to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet, together with most of her sisters, during the Abyssinian crisis, in September and remained there until December. Firedrake was refitted at Gibraltar from 14 December 1935 to 11 February 1936. She briefly returned home to give leave to the crew later that month, but she returned to the Mediterranean in March and remained there until July when she began a refit at Sheerness Dockyard.|$|E
