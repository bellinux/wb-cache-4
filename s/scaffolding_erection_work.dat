50|$|Unlike {{the heavy}} masonry engine house {{used to support}} the beam and pivot of a {{conventional}} beam engine, the grasshopper beam was pivoted on a swinging link. The crankpin was carried directly by the beam and moved {{in a straight line}} vertically, the beam pivot moving slightly sideways on its link to allow this. This simplified the need for a parallel motion linkage on the piston rod. Grasshopper engines were thus lighter than conventional beam engines and could be built completely in factories, rather than requiring considerable <b>erection</b> <b>work</b> to be carried out on-site. This encouraged the use of grasshopper engines for smaller sized engines. Some makers, notably Easton & Amos of Southwark, specialised in such engines. Many were used for pumping, but not for powering large mills.|$|R

In the current global framework, with growing oil price instability and the environmental requirements derived from compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, the sustainability of this technological solution inevitably passes through continued improvement of energy efficiency of the physical processes involved, as well as the use of renewable energy resources, such as for example, solar energy.

The builders were Hardy & Co. of Woking whose tender of £5,578 on 16 September 1912 was accepted for the <b>erection</b> <b>work,</b> {{and one of the}} contractors was electricity company Hunt & Sons of Charles Street, Herne Bay, who ran a cable underground from their works, beneath Canterbury Road and through the cliff. The entertainers Rouse, Way & Wilson made an advance investment of £700 in the theatre, the profits to be shared by the Council. The excavation commenced in October 1912, and [...] "many thousands of yards of London Clay" [...] were removed to extend the building into the cliff. The 1904 building was incorporated and extended as a theatre, concert hall and dance hall below the Downs on East Cliff, and the existing small auditorium became the vestibule for the new hall. The 1913 Hall was designed to accommodate 1,500, with 1,100 in the open-air theatre on the roof. The high price for this build partly reflects the large excavation into the cliff for the Hall, and the early use of ferro-concrete, with steel bars made by the Spiral Bond Bar Company, who had patented the process that they used in the same year.

40|$|Traditional cast in situ {{construction}} {{has been a}} common practice adopted by building industry in this country. This process could not meet the huge demand on affordable housing which is the major issue now because it requires large number of workers, massive casting and <b>erection</b> <b>work,</b> and longer construction time. As a solution to this, a precast system needs to be innovated {{as an alternative to}} this traditional system. Current research has been focusing on precast panel system made of conventional concrete. Therefore, this research investigated the structural behaviour of single and two connected Sandwiched Precast Foamed Concrete Panel (PLFP). Eight single PLFP and three sets of connected PLFP panels were cast using foamed concrete as the wythe and polystyrene as the core layer. The panels were strengthened with steel bar reinforcement embedded in both wythes which were connected to each other by the steel shear truss connectors. Single PLFP panels were tested under axial load while connected PLFP panels were tested under flexural load test. The results were analyzed in term of the panel’s ultimate load, crack pattern and mode of failure, load-deflection and load-strain profiles. It was found that the ultimate load recorded in single PLFP panels from experiment showed good agreement with the values from previous research. Connected PLFP panels were able to sustain slightly lower ultimate load compared to single PLFP panel. The percentage difference between these ultimate load values is about 14 %. The value of ultimate load recorded for single and connected PLFP panels were 171 kN and 147 kN, respectively. For both single and connected PLFP panels, it was observed that ultimate load, crack pattern and failure mode, load-deflection and load-strain profiles were significantly influenced by the panel’s slenderness ratio. Finite element analysis using LUSAS software is also carried out to study the effect of slenderness ratio on ultimate load. It was observed that the difference value between FEM and Experimental for single and connected PLFP panels are in a good agreement which recorded 4. 5 % and 5. 8 %, respectively...|$|R

It consumed 26,500 tons of steel, out of which 23,000 tons of high-tensile alloy steel, known as Tiscrom, were supplied by Tata Steel. The main tower was constructed with single monolith caissons of dimensions 55.31 x 24.8 m [...] with 21 shafts, each 6.25 metre square. The Chief Engineer of the Port Trust, Mr. J.

Work could not be started as World War I (1914-1918) broke out. Then in 1926 a commission under the Chairmanship of Sir R. N.
