The general US {{population}} has adequate iodine nutrition, with {{women of childbearing age}} and pregnant women having a possible mild risk of deficiency. In Japan, consumption was considered much higher, ranging between 5,280μg/day to 13,800μg/day from dietary seaweed or kombu kelp, often in the form of Kombu Umami extracts for <b>soup</b> <b>stock</b> and potato chips. However, new studies suggest that Japan's consumption is closer to 1,000–3,000μg/day. The adult UL in Japan was last revised to 3,000µg/day in 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{geographical}} territory was {{abundant in}} rich food sources from land animals to sea life and plants and animals. For meat, deer, bear, elk, duck, swan, and small rodents such as squirrel. With ocean food it was mussels, sea eggs, cockles, clams, seaweed, herring, trout, crab, urchin, sea lion, seal, {{all kinds of}} salmon. [...] For berries and plants, it was different kinds of wild blueberry, blackberry, salmon berry, salal berry, five different kinds of grass and the roots of different plants. Ooligans were once in their river system and Ooligan grease was once made from it. [...] Sea food, particularly salmon was their main staple. [...] It was this abundance of sea food and salmon that their diet was considerably heavy on natural fats and oils. This left relatively small amounts of carbohydrates in the diet. [...] To ensure that essentials vitamins are acquired, they eat almost all parts of animals which they harvest. [...] Bones used for <b>soup</b> <b>stock</b> provide leached calcium, as do ground calcined shells. Vitamin A is obtained from liver. Vitamin C is primarily found in berries and some other plants, such as skunk cabbage leaves. Intestines and stomachs can be eaten to provide vitamin E and the vitamin B complexes. [...] Within the decade following the establishment of Fort Langley in 1827 the Squamish had begun extensive farming of potatoes. [...] Recent shifts away from a traditional diet, relatively low in carbs and sugar has led to many health problems in the present day Squamish community.|$|E
