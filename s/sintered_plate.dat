The heated element for Fluorinert FC- 72 was a thin plate made of Haynes- 230. Infrared thermography was used to determine changes in the temperature on its outer smooth side. The porous surface in contact with the fluid in the minichannel was produced in two processes: sintering or soldering of Fe powder to the plate. The results were presented as relationships between the heat transfer coefficient and the distance from the minichannel inlet and as boiling curves. Results obtained for using a smooth heated plate at the saturated boiling region were also presented to compare. In the subcooled boiling region, at a higher heat flux, the heat transfer coefficient was slightly higher for the surface prepared via soldering. In the saturated boiling region, the local heat transfer coefficients obtained for the smooth plate surface were slightly higher than those achieved from the <b>sintered</b> <b>plate</b> surface.

40|$|Hydrogen {{produced}} by water electrolysis is a promising storage medium for renewable energy. Reducing the capital cost of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers without losing efficiency {{is one of}} its most pressing challenges. Gas diffusion layers (GDL), such as felts, foams, meshes and <b>sintered</b> <b>plates,</b> are key stack components, but these are either inefficient or expensive. This study presents a new type of GDL produced via vacuum plasma spraying (VPS), which offers a large potential for cost reduction. With this technology, it is possible to introduce a gradient in the pore-size distribution along the thickness of the GDL by varying the plasma parameters and titanium powder particle sizes. This feature was confirmed by cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray computed tomography (CT) and mercury intrusion porosimetry allowed determining the porosity, pore radii distribution, and pore entry distribution. Pore radii of ca. 10 mm could be achieved in the layers of the GDL close to the bipolar plate, while those in contact with the electrodes were in the range of 5 mm. The thermally sprayed Ti-GDLs allowed achieving PEM electrolyzer performances comparable to those of the state-of-the-art <b>sintered</b> <b>plates</b> and far superior than those of meshes. Moreover, a numerical model showed that the reduced capillary pressure and tortuosity eliminates mass transport limitations at 2 A cm- 2.

40|$|When an {{unsteady}} wake from an upstream body impinges on a downstream body, {{the resultant}} interaction noise can be significant. The use of distributed blowing {{through the surface}} of a cylinder to reduce this source of noise was investigated experimentally. Two configurations were tested, one with a cylinder upstream of an H-beam (denoted the OH configuration) and the other with an H-beam upstream of the cylinder (denoted the HO configuration). The mean velocities and velocity fluctuations were determined in the flowfield using particle image velocimetry. The application of blowing to the OH configuration reduced the streamwise Reynolds stress (u′u′). This resulted in a noise reduction of 9. 2 dB at a Strouhal number (St) of 0. 2. There was a broadband noise reduction of 3 dB averaged over a Strouhal number range 0. 05 < St < 5. The effect of blowing on the HO configuration was to inhibit the strong crossflow Reynolds stress (w′w′) between the H-beam and the cylinder. This resulted in a noise reduction of 15 dB at a Strouhal number of 0. 8. There was a broadband noise reduction of 4. 6 dB averaged over the frequency range 0. 05 < St < 6. 3.

The rise velocities of individual bubbles with hydrate shells of different thickness and the consumption rates of methane gas were measured. A kinetic model was developed to correlate the experimentally measured gas consumption rate data. It was found that the hydrate formation rate on the surface of the moving bubble was high, but the formed hydrate shell was not very easy to be broken up. The bubbles with hydrate shells tended to agglomerate rather than merge into bigger bubble. This kind of characteristic of hydrate shell hindered the further formation of hydrate and led to the lower consumption rate of methane. The consumption rate of methane was found to increase with the decrease of temperature or increase of pressure. The increase of gas flux led to a linear increase in consumption rate of methane.

40|$|Single phase {{solutions}} containing three components {{have been observed}} to exhibit foaminess near a single to two liquid phase boundary. It was seen, in a <b>sintered</b> <b>plate</b> column under mass transfer conditions, that distillation systems where the liquid appeared as one phase {{in one part of}} a column and two phases in another part, exhibited foaminess when the liquid concentration was near the one phase to two phase boundary. Various ternary systems have been studied in a 50 plate. 30 mm i. d. Oldershaw column and it was observed that severe foaming occurred in the middle section of the column near the one liquid phase to two liquid phase boundary and no foaming occurred {{at the end of the}} column where liquid was either one phase or two phase. This is known as Ross type foam. Mass transfer experiments with Ross type ternary systems have been carried out in a perspex simulator with small and large hole diameter trays. It was observed that by removal of the more volatile component, Ross type foam did not build up on the tray. Severe entrainment of liquid was observed in all cases leading to a 'dry' tray, even with a low free area small diameter hole tray which was expected to produce a bubbly mixture. Entrainment was more severe for high gas superficial velocities and large hole diameters. This behaviour is quite different from the build up of foam observed when one liquid phase/two liquid phase Ross systems were contacted with air above a small sintered disc or with vapour in an Oldershaw distillation column. This observation explains why distillation columns processing mixtures which change from one liquid phase to two liquid phases (or vice versa) must be severely derated to avoid flooding. Single liquid phase holdups at the spray to bubbly transition were measured using a perspex simulator similar to that of Porter & Wong (17). i. e. with no liquid cross flow. A light transmission technique was used to measure the transition from spray regime to bubbly regime. The effect of tray thickness and the ratio of hole diameter to tray thickness on the transition was evaluated using trays of the same hole diameter and free area but having thickness of 2. 38 mm, 4 mm, and 6. 35 mm. The liquid holdup at the transition was less with the thin metal trays. This result may be interpreted by the theory of Lockett (101), which predicts the transition liquid holdup in terms of the angle of the gas iet leaving the holes in the sieve plate. All the existing correlations have been compared and none were found to be satisfactory and these correlations have been modified in view of the experimental results obtained. A new correlation has been proposed which takes into account the effect of the hole diameter to tray thickness ratio on the transition and good agreement was obtained between the experimental results and the correlated values of the liquid holdup at the transition. Results have been obtained for two immiscible liquids [kerosene and water] on trays to determine whether foaming can be eliminated by operating in the spray regime. Kerosene was added to a fixed volume of water or water was added to a fixed volume of kerosene. In both cases, there was a transition from spray to bubbly. In the water fixed system. the liquid holdup at the transition was slightly less than the pure kerosene system. Whilst for the kerosene fixed system, the transition occurred at much lower liquid holdups. Trends In the results were similar to those for single liquid phase. New correlations have been proposed for the two cases. It has been found that Ross type foams, observed in a <b>sintered</b> <b>plate</b> column and in the Oldershaw column can be eliminated by either carrying out the separation in a packed column or by the addition of defoaming additives...|$|E

In Brazil, exotic species of marine algae are being grown on a commercial scale {{in order to meet}} the demand of industrial phycoloide. The aim of this study was to analyze the texture of aqueous gels made with milk and carrageenan extracted from seaweed S. filiformis, cultivated in CearÃ through sporulation natural technique, in order to establish a comparison between these gels and those prepared with commercial carrageenans (iota and kappa carrageenan). The algae were grown through sporulation natural, where monthly PVC structures (25 mm) in size 25 x 44 cm, each containing a single nylon cord (10 mm) of 23 m length were kept at depths of 1 and 2 m over a period of nine months. For extraction of carrageenan were collected at both depths seaweed samples S. filiformis backstage with higher and lower biomass, some for the rainy season (January and April) and dry (October and November). Initially, the algae were dried, crushed in electric grinder and subjected to aqueous extraction (1. 5 % m / v), stirring every 20 minutes in a water bath at 90 ÂC for 4 h. The homogenates were filtered through nylon cloth, the waste discarded. The filtrates were subjected to filtration on a vacuum funnel <b>sintered</b> <b>plate,</b> and carrageenans obtained were frozen, lyophilized and weighed. The highest yields were obtained from carrageenan seaweed collected from the scenes that have accumulated during the dry spores (35. 6 % - November 2 M to 45. 3 % - October 1 M), while the algae that accumulated during the rainy season had the lowest incomes (29 6 % - April 1 M to 33. 8 % - April 2 M). In contrast, levels of total sugars ranged between 37. 6 and 50. 5 % and the content of carrageenan sulfate ranged from 21. 6 to 33. 3 % according to the levels already checked to carrageenans of the iota type. The texture of aqueous gels in the presence of CaCl 2 and 0. 1 % milk prepared with carrageenan S. filiformis and commercial concentrations of 0. 5 and 1. 5 %, were analyzed for firmness, adhesiveness, cohesiveness, springiness, gumminess and chewiness. All samples with carrageenan derived from S. filiformis backstage obtained values of firmness, gumminess and chewiness than those found for &# 953;-carrageenan commercial. Backstage November had the highest values in the parameter of firmness for aqueous gels and compared to &# 953;-carrageenan commercial dairy. Adhesiveness, elasticity and cohesiveness showed values close to those found for &# 953;-carrageenan commercial. The results for firmness and chewiness of &# 954;-carrageenan were superior when compared to commercial car &# 953;-carrageenan and S. filiformis. The gels formulated with milk obtained results strongly higher than those formulated with a solution of calcium chloride 0. 1 % due to interactions between the proteins and the milk carrageenan. With the data obtained it can be concluded that the use of carrageenan S. filiformis derived by sporulation natural cultivation is capable of forming gels when compared to stronger &# 953;-carrageenan commercial could generate savings through the use of lower concentrations of the carrageenan commercial, to obtain the desired firmness of a product...|$|E

In all cases the batches of powders were processed under identical conditions with sintering carried out in laboratory. Damage study of the <b>sintered</b> carbides <b>plates</b> during cutting tests have been interpretated following the Taylor's law, relating the tool lifes as a function of cutting speed...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{catalysts}} for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) based on MgO with a varying content of Li was synthesized by the gel combustion method. The resulting catalytically active systems were studied {{by a combination}} of TEM and SEM methods. Samples with low abundance of Li exhibit a hierarchical pore system built from tubular structures made from primary MgO particles. Upon calcination at 1073 K these particles undergo a change in shape from cubic via truncated octahedral to platelet morphologies depending on the content of Li in the precursor. Morphological indications were found for the role of Li as flux in this transformation. The modification of the primary particle morphology led to a drastic change in secondary structure from open sponges to compact <b>sintered</b> <b>plates</b> upon addition of Li above 10 wt% to the precursor. The microstructure of the primary particles reveals two families of high-energy structures namely edge-and-step structures and protrusions on flat terraces. A relation was found between catalytic function in OCM and the transformation from cubic to complex terminated particles. Based on these findings it is suggested that sites active for the coupling reaction of methane are related to the protrusions arising from segregation of oxygen vacancies to the surface of MgO...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} numerically {{the dynamics}} of crack propagation along a weak plane using a model consisting of fibers connecting a soft and a hard clamp. This bottom-up model has previously been shown to contain the competition of two crack propagation mechanisms: coalescence of damage with the front on small scales and pinned elastic line motion on large scales. We investigate the dynamical scaling properties of the model, both on small and large scale. The model results compare favorable with experimental results on stable crack propagation between <b>sintered</b> PMMA <b>plates...</b>|$|R
40|$|The temperature, velocity, and {{concentration}} distributions were measured in boundary layers adjacent to heated vertical polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and wood (Southern Pine) surfaces, {{and next to}} a heated, vertical, <b>sintered</b> bronze <b>plate</b> through which propane was injected. The temperature, velocity, {{and concentration}} were measured as functions of position and time using thermocouple probes, flow visualization techniques, and heterodyne holographic interferometry, respectively. The measured distributions were compared {{to the results of}} a simple model. The agreement between the measured values and the results of the model was generally good and was within the experimental uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUsing a multi-resolution technique, we analyze large {{in-plane}} fracture fronts {{moving slowly}} between two <b>sintered</b> Plexiglas <b>plates.</b> We {{find that the}} roughness of the front exhibits two distinct regimes separated by a crossover length scale δ^*. Below δ^*, we observe a multi-affine regime and the measured roughness exponent ζ_∥^- = 0. 60 ± 0. 05 is {{in agreement with the}} coalescence model. Above δ^*, the fronts are mono-affine, characterized by a roughness exponent ζ_∥^+ = 0. 35 ± 0. 05, consistent with the fluctuating line model. We relate the crossover length scale to fluctuations in fracture toughness and the stress intensity factor...|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} ISO - 11092 or the Ret or Hohenstein test [...] In this test, fabric is placed above a porous (<b>sintered)</b> metal <b>plate.</b> The plate is heated and water is channeled into the metal plate, {{simulating}} perspiration. The plate is then kept {{at a constant}} temperature. As water vapor passes through the plate and the fabric, it causes Evaporative Heat Loss and therefore more energy is {{needed to keep the}} plate at a constant temperature. Ret is the measurement of the resistance to evaporative heat loss. The lower the Ret value, the less resistance to moisture transfer and therefore higher breathability.|$|R
40|$|Measurements of thermo- and diffusio-phoretic {{velocities}} of {{aerosol particles}} (camauba wax, paraffin and sodium chloride) were performed in microgravity conditions (Drop Tower facility, in Bremen, and Parabolic Flights, in Bordeaux). In {{the case of}} thermophoresis, a temperature gradient was obtained by heating the upper plate of the cell, while the lower one was maintained at environmental temperature. For diffusiophoresis, the water vapour gradient was obtained with <b>sintered</b> <b>plates</b> imbued with a water solution Of MgCl 2 and distilled water, {{at the top and}} {{at the bottom of the}} cell, respectively. Aerosol particles were observed through a digital holographic velocimeter, a device allowing the determination of 3 -D coordinates of particles from the observed volume. Particle trajectories and consequently particle velocities were reconstructed through the analysis of the sequence of particle positions. The experimental values of reduced thermophoretic velocities are between the theoretical values of Yamamoto and Ishihara [Yamamoto, K., Ishihara, Y., 1988. Thermophoresis of a spherical particle in a rarefied gas of a transition regime. Phys. Fluids. 3 1, 3618 - 3624] and Talbot et al. [Talbot, L., Cheng, R. K., Schefer, R. W., Willis, D. R., 1980. Thermophoresis of particles in a heated boundary layer. J. Fluid Mech. 101, 737 - 758], and do not show a clear dependence on the thermal conductivity of the aerosol. The existence of negative thennophoresis is not confirmed in our experiments. Concerning diffusiophoretic experiments, the results obtained show a small increase of reduced diffusiophoretic velocity with the Knudsen number...|$|R
