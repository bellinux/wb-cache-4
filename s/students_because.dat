As in Leeds, Priestley established classes for the youth of his parish and by 1781, he was teaching 150 <b>students.</b> <b>Because</b> Priestley's New Meeting salary was only 100 guineas, friends and patrons donated money and goods to help continue his investigations. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1782.|$|E

25|$|The {{entrance}} {{of a new}} life means changing and adapting. Beginning freshmen enter a new phase that affects the way they eat. They are unaware of their nutrition and they only want something from what they see. High school {{is very different from}} what college is. Students transition from being in small classroom into big lecture rooms. The same goes for food, they transition from being served in cafeterias to buffet styles in college. Dining centers excite new <b>students</b> <b>because</b> this is a new experience, therefore they grab more than what they should. It’s something new and it’s what they’re paying for.|$|E

25|$|The SBOE sets {{curriculum}} {{standards for}} Texas {{public schools and}} exerts considerable influence over the selection and content of Texas school textbooks used by over five million K-12 <b>students.</b> <b>Because</b> {{of the size of}} Texas' textbook market, learning materials developed for Texas are often used in other states as well. The SBOE has faced school textbook controversy in the past when former board members tried to inject ideologically-driven information into science, history, and social studies textbooks that they believed was vital to be taught in Texas schools. With Bruner on the SBOE, citizens fear the far-right conservative would have an agenda to mount a similar attack on facts.|$|E

Two test scores were created: raw {{scores of the}} number of correct responses (out of 17), and proportions of answers correct out of the number attempted by each <b>student</b> <b>because</b> <b>students</b> sometimes skipped questions. Changes in student interest in mathematics and robotics, and recognized value of math in robotics were also scored to investigate whether participation in the intervention changed students’ opinions.|$|R
25|$|The {{first big}} city to aggressively promote {{the use of}} Norplant was Baltimore. Baltimore {{targeted}} teenagers because the birthrate was three times higher than other states. In Baltimore, about ten percent of girls between ages 15 and 17 gave birth during 1990. Young mothers would often {{drop out of school}} and struggle to raise the child in poverty. The mayor at the time, Kurt Schmoke, pushed for laws that would give teen girls more access to Norplant. Norplant was eventually given to teen girls at schools without parental consent. Programs were designed for, and performed in, predominantly black schools. Laurence G. Paquin Middle School became the first school to provide Norplant to their students. Paquin Middle School had 355 female students but only 5 of them were not black. Their program started off as a pilot program and soon other urban high schools like San Fernando High School in Los Angeles and Crane High School in Chicago’s West Side adopted the program of providing Norplant to their <b>students.</b> <b>Because</b> of a focus on predominantly black schools, questions of racism arose amongst black community leaders.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} what {{followed}} during the students' clash with the police vary. According to police reports, the police chased the <b>students</b> <b>because</b> they had hijacked three buses and attempted to drive them off {{to carry out the}} protests and then return to their college. Members of the student union, however, stated that they had been protesting and were hitchhiking when they clashed with the police. As the buses sped away and the chase ensued, the police opened fire on the vehicles. Two students were killed in one of the buses, while some fled into the surrounding hills. Roughly three hours later, escaped students returned to the scene to speak with reporters. In a related incident, unidentified gunmen fired at a bus carrying players from a local soccer team, which they had presumably mistaken for one of the buses that picked up the student protestors. Bullets struck the bus and hit two taxis. The bus driver, a football player, and a woman inside one of the taxis were killed. The next morning, the authorities discovered the corpse of a student, Julio César Mondragón, who had attempted to run away during the gunfire. His eyes had been gouged out and the skin of his face flayed to a bare skull. In total, 6 people were killed and 25 wounded.|$|E

Tina is very loyal to Mia, who consults her for sensitive advice rather than the harsher Lilly.
