In New England the soft-shell clam is preyed heavily upon by northern moon snails and invasive green crabs. They are also a favorite of sea gulls, which pull the clam from the sand, climb to about 15 - 20 ft, and then drop the clam on a hard surface, breaking the shell.

40|$|Sperm {{concentration}} and sperm ageing effects on fertilisation success were evaluated {{in the laboratory}} in the free-spawning Antarctic <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>clam</b> Laternula elliptica and Antarctic limpet Nacella concinna. Fertilisation success was highly dependent on sperm concentration. Highest levels of fertilisation success were consistently replicated at 107 sperm ml- 1 for L. elliptica, and 106 to 108 sperm ml- 1 for N. concinna. However, both species exhibited extremely low fertilisation rates at concentrations 106 sperm ml- 1 N. concinna displayed a rapid increase in abnormally developing larvae which, along with only a small decline in total fertilisation success above 108 sperm ml- 1, was taken to indicate polyspermy. A small increase in abnormal development followed by a rapid decline in fertilisation success at high sperm concentrations (> 107 sperm ml- 1) for L. elliptica was attributed to oxygen depletion. Using the optimum sperm concentration found for fertilisation success, spermatozoa were capable of fertilising fresh ova for > 90 h in L. elliptica, and 65 h in N. concinna. The sperm concentrations required for fertilisation success and sperm longevities reported here are at least {{an order of magnitude}} greater than those reported for nearshore temperate molluscs. Our data strongly suggest that the specific reproductive behaviour and timing of spawning activities displayed by these Antarctic molluscs is vital to enhance fertilisation success in the polar marine environment. ...|$|E

We tested the resilience of juvenile stages compared to adults in 4 species of Antarctic marine invertebrate over 3 different rates of experimental warming. The species used represent 3 phyla and 4 classes, and were the <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>clam</b> Laternula elliptica, the sea cucumber Cucumaria georgiana, the sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri, and the seastar Odontaster validus. All four species are widely distributed, locally abundant to very abundant and are amongst the most important in the ecosystem for their roles.

40|$|Increasing {{temperatures}} and glacier melting at the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) are causing rapid changes in shallow coastal and shelf systems. Climate change-related rising water temperatures, enhanced ice scouring, {{as well as}} coastal sediment runoff, in combination with changing feeding conditions and microbial community composition, will affect all elements of the nearshore benthic ecosystem, {{a major component of}} which is the Antarctic <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>clam</b> Laternula elliptica. A 454 -based RNA sequencing was carried out on tissues and hemocytes of L. elliptica, resulting in 42, 525 contigs, of which 48 % was assigned putative functions. Changes in the expression of putative stress response genes were then investigated in hemocytes and siphon tissue of young and old animals subjected to starvation and injury experiments in order to investigate their response to sedimentation (food dilution and starvation) and iceberg scouring (injury). Analysis of antioxidant defense (Le-SOD and Le-catalase), wound repair (Le-TIMP and Le-chitinase), and stress and immune response (Le-HSP 70, Le-actin, and Le-theromacin) genes revealed that most transcripts were more clearly affected by injury rather than starvation. The upregulation of these genes was particularly high in the hemocytes of young, fed individuals after acute injury. Only minor changes in expression were detected in young animals under the selected starvation conditions and in older individuals. The stress response of L. elliptica thus depends {{on the nature of the}} environmental cue and on age. This has consequences for future population predictions as the environmental changes at the WAP will differentially impact L. elliptica age classes and is bound to alter population structur...|$|E

40|$|Shellfish {{have the}} {{capacity}} to accumulate chemical contaminants found in their biotope and therefore present a potential risk for consumers. This study was conducted to assess the chemical risks associated with consumption of shellfish harvested on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River’s lower estuary. A survey was carried out on 162 recreational harvesters, and shellfish were sampled for chemical contaminant analysis. We quantified 10 metals, 22 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 14 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and 10 chlorinated pesticides. We subsequently evaluated cancer and noncancer risks for four consumption scenarios based on our survey results and published results. <b>Soft-shell</b> <b>clams</b> (Mya arenaria) were by far the most consumed shellfish species. Of the 56 selected contaminants, 36 were detected in the 23 homogenates of <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clam</b> meat. None of the contaminants found in the <b>soft-shell</b> <b>clams</b> were associated with intakes that exceed the main exposure limit recommendations proposed to prevent noncancer effects. However, several limits must be considered before drawing conclusions about the relative safety of shellfish consumption regarding this end point.

It is possible that clams feeding on the low quantity diet were expending more energy in obtaining particles (higher ingestion rate despite lower food concentrations) but perhaps less energy in digesting them (clams feeding on the low quantity diet had an absoiption efficiency equal to those feeding on the 10 mg diet, but over a longer gut retention time.
