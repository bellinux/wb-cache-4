40|$|Determining <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>distribution</b> is {{critical}} to identify sites which {{are at risk of}} N and P loading. Equally important are determining factors that influence such distribution (e. g. land use, land management, topography, etc.). In this research, <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>distribution</b> and its influencing factors were studied in a small-scaled watershed in the purple soil region of Sichuan Province, China. The watershed is 1. 3 km 2 with a complex land management system including agriculture and forestry. Surface soil samples (0 ¿ 20 cm) from 48 sites within the watershed were collected in the spring of 1999 and analysed for chemical properties. When spatial distribution patterns of soil organic matter and soil nutrients were considered, several patterns were evident. Soil organic matter and total nitrogen coincided with high soil nutrients {{in the center of the}} watershed. Total phosphorus was linked to low soil nutrient contents on hilltops, while total potassium was characterized by low variability and high soil nutrient content throughout the watershed. Water-soluble nutrients in soils were highly variable throughout the watershed. Results of this study indicate that land use, topography and other variables play important roles in controlling the spatial distribution of most soil nutrients. However, the relative roles of these indices were nutrient specific. The relationship was therefore complex. Land use, silt, and sand content contributed to a high level of heterogeneity for soil organic matter and total nitrogen with the former being the dominant factor. Land use, particle size distribution (silt and sand) and topographic factors (slope and elevation) contributed to the variability of total phosphorus. However, particle size distribution and topographic factors were the dominant factors affecting total phosphorus. Elevation influenced the concentration of total potassium and land use controlled the concentration of dissolved phosphorous. No significant relationship was found between the studied characteristics and nitrate nitroge...|$|E

Different ecosystems have different characteristic to affect the diversity and abundance of Collembola. In the ecosystem, Collembola {{have an important role}} in biocontrol, decomposition, <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>distribution,</b> stimulation of soil microbial activity and as an alternative feed for predators. This study was aimed to investigate the diversity and abundance of Collembola in four ecosystems at Harapan forest, i. e. secondary forest, rubber forest, rubber smallholder and oil palm smallholder. To achieve the objective, soil samples were taken at 48 observation points in the four ecosystem. The soil samples were then extracted by Kempson Extractor. The diversity and abundance of Collembola in four ecosystems were categorized as medium to high. The total of individual and population of Collembola in the secondary and rubber forest ecosystems were likely to be higher than in the rubber and oil palm smallholders. This study had also identified four orders, 14 families and 31 genera of Collembola, where Isotomiella and Proisotoma dominated the genus of Collembola in the four ecosystems.

A field experiment was conducted during the wet season (June-October) of 2014 planting season at two locations within the Research Farm of the College of Agriculture, Jalingo, Taraba State, Nigeria {{to determine the effects of}} cattle manure rates on <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>distribution</b> and yield of cotton. Four nitrogen rates in cattle manure (150, 200, 250 and 300 kg N/ha) and a control (no amendment) were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The experimental soil was loamy sand whether at the surface (0 - 15 cm), subsurface (15 - 30 cm) or sub subsurface (30 - 60 cm) with clay content increasing down the profile. The soil pH was moderately acid at the surface but strongly acid at the sub surfaces. Nutrient distribution in the soil after cotton harvest shows that nutrients in the soil were affected by rates of application of cattle manure with the values increasing with increase in manure rates and decreasing as the soil depth increases. The yield components such as cottonseed yield, lint yield, seed yield, number of bolls per plant and boll weight were significantly (P < 0. 05) improved compared with the control. The highest cottonseed yield of 1453 kg/ha was produced from plots treated with 250 kg N/ha.

The collected data were analysed descriptively. The study indicates that chemical characteristics of soil on leda stand is better than that of the virgin forest and the best of all other stands. Only the N content which is higher in the virgin stand than in any other stands in the plantation forest. The nutrient content of P, Ca, and Mg are higher in leda, whereas mangium has the highest content of K. Sengon has the least content of all observed nutrients. Mangium has the highest total biomass and nutrient accumulation (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) but sengon has the lowest. The accumulation of N, P, K of mangium is higher than the content found in the soil underneath the stand. On the contrary, Ca and Mg are found higher in the soil. Similar results are found in sengon and leda stands. Based on basal area and dominant height measurements the three-species plantations are considered low in productivity and categorised as site quality I.

We set up mesocosms (trays 49 × 49 cm and 12 cm deep) with the same amount of available P, but distributed either homogeneously or heterogeneously, in randomly arranged cells (7 × 7 cm each) with high or low available P. The trays were planted with either 1 or 4 seedlings of T. subterraneum per cell. Half of the trays were inoculated with spores of the mycorrhizal fungus Gigaspora margarita. We harvested the plants when leaves just started to overlap, 8 weeks after planting. Plants growing in high P cells had the lowest percentage infection, but the highest mean shoot and root biomass and root length. The mean size of the plants in each cell was determined mainly by local P concentration. However, in plants growing in high density, low P cells, ca. 20 % of the variability in plant biomass was explained by the number of adjacent cells with high P. Patchy trays had the highest total shoot biomass, independently of mycorrhizal infection or plant density. Inoculated trays (M) had higher total shoot biomass and relative competition intensity (measured as reduction in plant biomass due to increased density) than non-inoculated trays (NM). Plant density reduced the plant response to mycorrhizal infection, and its effect was independent of P distribution. All populations growing in patchy trays, and low density mycorrhizal ones, had the highest plant-size inequality, presumably because patchy distribution of P and mycorrhizal infection increased competitive asymmetry. We conclude that mycorrhizal symbiosis has the potential to strongly influence plant population structure when <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>distribution</b> is heterogeneous because it promotes pre-emption of limiting resources.

This pattern has an important effect on soil moisture and soil nutrients. The Danangou catchment, a typical small catchment, was selected to {{study the effects of}} land use and its patterns on soil moisture and nutrients in this paper. The results are as follows: The comparisons of soil moisture among seven land uses for wet year and dry year were performed: (1) the average of soil moisture content for whole catchment was 12. 11 % in wet year, while it was 9. 37 % in dry year; (2) soil moisture among seven land uses was significantly different in dry year, but not in wet year; (3) from wet year to dry year, the profile type of soil moisture changed from decreasing type to fluctuation-type and from fluctuant type to increasing type; (4) the increasing trend in soil moisture from the top to foot of hillslope occurred in simple land use along slope, while complicated distribution of soil moisture was observed in multiple land uses along slope. The relationships between soil nutrients and land uses and landscape positions were analysed: (1) five nutrient contents of soil organic matter (SOM), total N (TN), available N (AN), total P (TP) and available P (AP) in hilly area were lower than that in other areas.

Simulations conducted with Monte Carlo techniques {{were used to}} expose roots to different levels of nutrient variability with numbers of patches set at 10 large or 1000 small patches over the rooting zone of a single tussock. With constant uptake kinetics, simulated whole-plant uptake of both NO 3 − and P by established or growing roots was highest in <b>soils</b> with the <b>nutrients</b> distributed uniformly but declined with increasing <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> variability for both nutrients. The decline was greater for NO 3 − than for P and was greater for both ions in <b>soils</b> with <b>nutrients</b> distributed in the 10 large patches. The reduction in predicted nutrient uptake with increasing variability was more pronounced with higher mean concentrations of P, while mean concentration {{had little effect on}} the pattern of NO 3 − uptake.

Vegetation throughout the southwestern United States has changed from perennial grassland to woody shrubland over the past century. Previous studies on the development of 'islands of fertility' focused primarily on only the most limiting, plant-essential element, soil nitrogen (N). The research presented here addressed the question of whether other plant-essential elements, namely phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), showed similar concentration gradients under the desert shrub Larrea tridentata (creosotebush). It also examined whether the spatial distribution of N, P, and K differed from that of essential, but non-limiting nutrients, namely calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sulfur (S), and non-essential elements, namely sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), and fluoride (F). Within adjacent grassland and shrubland plots, surface soils were collected under and between vegetation and analyzed for a suite of soil nutrients. <b>Soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>distribution</b> followed a uniform pattern that mirrored the spatial homogeneity of bunchgrasses in the grassland, but followed a patchy distribution that mirrored the spatial heterogeneity of individual shrubs in the shrubland. The main differences were that in the grassland, all elements were uniformly distributed, but in the shrubland the plant-essential elements, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, were concentrated under the shrub canopy, and the non-limiting and non-essential elements were either concentrated in the intershrub spaces or were equally concentrated under shrubs and in the interspaces. Our results show how vegetation shifts from grassland to shrubland contribute to long-term, widespread change in the structure and function of desert ecosystems...|$|E

Repeated prescribed burning {{has been used to}} control Prosopis distribution, but effects of fires on grassland <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>distribution</b> and aboveground plant biomass are also largely unknown. I examined recent research concerning P. velutina natural history, emphasizing characteristics that contribute to range expansion. I also evaluated Prosopis management practices [...] -which include herbicide treatment, prescribed burning, grazing reduction, and mechanical removal [...] -and management goals [...] -which involve complete removal, no removal, and limited removal. Of these, limited removal is the most beneficial, using an herbicide application followed by periodic prescribed burning. In 1997 I established a study area at Fort Huachuca Military Reservation in southeastern Arizona, selecting two adjacent sites with similar soil composition and topography but different fire histories. I examined spatial and seasonal changes in composition and distribution of available soil N and litterfall. My results indicated these were more spatially and temporally heterogenous on sites with low fire frequency and high P. velutina stand development. In 1998 I selected nine sites at Fort Huachuca on two upland surfaces located < 1 km apart, with similar soil physical characteristics and fire frequencies ranging from 0 to 5 fires/decade. I evaluated relationships between fire frequency, soil nutrient status (pH, available P, organic C, total N, and available N), and aboveground plant biomass, including that of the non-native Eragrostis lehmanniana (Lehmann lovegrass). Soil pH and ammonium significantly decreased with increased fire frequency on one surface, and available P significantly decreased with increased fire frequency on the other surface. Available P and pH were significantly different between the 2 surfaces, but aboveground biomass was similar. Soil nutrient status and biomass were not related, suggesting plant-available soil nutrients may not control plant distribution or recovery following fire. E. lehmanniana biomass was negatively correlated with native grass and forb biomass, and tended to increase with increasing fire frequency. Surface litter and E. lehmanniana biomass were correlated, and may increase fire frequency, an important consideration when implementing grassland fire management practices...|$|E

Methods A 100 m × 100 m forest plot was established on a hillside in a karst area in Maolan National Nature Reserve, Guizhou Province, Southwest China. All woody species with a diameter at breast height ≥ 1 cm were identified and surveyed. Surface soil samples (0 – 10 cm) were collected from a grid of 10 m × 10 m for the analysis of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients.</b> The spatial variability of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> and its impact on distributions of tree species were analyzed by using geo-statistic methods (semivariogram and Kriging interpolation) and ordination (canonical correspondence analysis, CCA). Important findings The coefficient of variation for <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> ranges from 10 % to 80 %, and can be considered relatively moderate. Total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), total magnesium (TMg) and pH show strong spatial autocorrelation, while organic matter (OM), total calcium (TCa), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) show moderate spatial autocorrelation. The variation range of soil TCa is the smallest (56. 2 m) and those of OM, TP and AK are larger. Spatial distribution of TP, TK, TCa, TMg, AP and pH decreases with increasing elevation and decreasing cover of bare rock, while OM increases with increasing elevation, which indicated that the spatial distributions and variability of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> were mainly affected by topographic factors and habitat characteristics (especially elevation, slope, slope aspect, slope location and cover of bare rock). CCA indicated that the spatial <b>distribution</b> of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients,</b> especially TK, TMg, pH, TCa and OM, has an important impact on tree species composition and distribution, and thus showed a prevalence of soil resource-based niche differentiation among tree species.

40|$|Aims: The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypotheses}} that <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> patchiness can differentially benefit the decomposition of root and shoot litters and that this facilitation depends on plant genotypes. Methods: We grew 15 cultivars (i. e. genotypes) of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under uniform and patchy <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients,</b> and contrasted their biomass and the subsequent mass, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics of their root and shoot litters. Results: Under equal amounts of <b>nutrients,</b> patchy <b>distribution</b> increased root biomass and had no effects on shoot biomass and C:N ratios of roots and shoots. Roots and shoots decomposed more rapidly in patchy nutrients than in uniform nutrients, and reductions in root and shoot C:N ratios with decomposition were greater in patchy nutrients than uniform <b>nutrients.</b> <b>Soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> patchiness facilitated shoot decomposition more than root decomposition. The changes in C:N ratios with decomposition were correlated with initial C:N ratios of litter, regardless of roots or shoots.

Our results showed that: (1) females suffered greater negative effects and exhibited lower defense capacities than did males under HUVB radiation, low <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status and their combination; (2) low <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status reduced plant's sensitivity to HUVB radiation by increasing allocation to defense and decreasing allocation to growth compared with high <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status.

40|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> is an {{important}} aspect {{that contributes to the}} soil fertility and environmental effects. Traditional evaluation approaches of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> are quite hard to operate, making great difficulties in practical applications. In this paper, we present a series of comprehensive evaluation models for <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> by using support vector machine (SVM), multiple linear regression (MLR), and artificial neural networks (ANNs), respectively. We took the content of organic matter, total nitrogen, alkali-hydrolysable nitrogen, rapidly available phosphorus, and rapidly available potassium as independent variables, while the evaluation level of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> content was taken as dependent variable. Results show that the average prediction accuracies of SVM models are 77. 87 % and 83. 00 %, respectively, while the general regression neural network (GRNN) model’s average prediction accuracy is 92. 86 %, indicating that SVM and GRNN models can be used effectively to assess the levels of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> with suitable dependent variables. In practical applications, both SVM and GRNN models can be used for determining the levels of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient...</b>|$|R

However, the knowledge of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> conditions from Hani terraced paddy fields is limited. This paper investigates such <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> parameters as organic matter (OM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP), total potassium (TK), available potassium (AK) of four sampling sites of paddy fields under special geographical environment and agricultural technology, and compares the differences of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> related to spatial patterns and temporal periods. Correlation analysis is performed to analyze the impact of environmental factors on <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients,</b> as well as the relationships between <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> parameters and altitude, slope direction, gradient and distance from village. The results show that there were some differences separately in the content of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> such as OM, TN, TP, AP, TK and AK. The AK and AP levels are lower in the fallow period than that in the tillage period, only OM level in the fallow period is higher than that in the tillage period; TN, TK, TP levels are nearly similar in the tillage and the fallow period. Unlike great differences in two periods, <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> content in the ridge of fields is identical basically with the content in the corresponding paddy fields. Correlation analysis shows that <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> of AK, TP, TN and OM have distinctive negative correlations with distance from villages, while AP and TK display a slight fluctuation...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Growing {{concerns}} {{about the need to}} increase crop productivity without causing environmental injury have led to the deployment of site-specific strategies in <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> management, where nutrients are applied in variable rates to fit local requirements. Variable rate application of nutrients is typically based on a rigorous sampling regime and time-consuming data analyses. The ability to monitor <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> concentration efficiently is highly desirable. Approach: On-site monitoring of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> concentration offers the opportunity for higher density measurements at relatively lower costs. This would allow for an efficient mapping of nutrient variability to facilitate variable-rate nutrient application. Results: Implementation of nutrient management programs using sensor technology potentially promotes environmental stewardship while maintaining crop productivity and profitability. Rapid and non-destructive quantification of spatially-variable <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> has been made possible with on-the-go sensors such as optical, electromagnetic and electrochemical sensors.

After its introduction into the zone of West Africa in 1890, the area planted to cocoa increased rapidly to its present 1. 5 million hectares and yield increased to peak of 310, 000 tons in 1965. However, as early as 1940 manifestation of deficiency symptoms necessitated the need for research to balance <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients,</b> and from 1966, yield declined gradually to its present 155, 000 tons, and many workers have attributed this yield decline essentially to <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> imbalance.

40|$|Maize is the world’s {{third most}} {{important}} cereal after wheat and rice. It {{serves as a}} staple food to more than 1. 2 billion of the world population. However, its production is threatened by declining soil fertility; mainly due to low inputs of fertilizers containing major elements to replenish lost <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> and unsustainable <b>soil</b> tillage practices linked to mono-cropping. To examine the influence of N, P and K and residual compost on maize growth and yield, an experiment was carried out at the Hatfield Experimental Farm of the University of Pretoria. Utilizing the long-term maize trial, controls (0 and W), seven inorganic fertilizer treatments (N, P, K, NP, NK, PK & NPK) and seven organic + inorganic fertilizer treatments (WN, WP, WK, WNP, WNK, WPK & WNPK) were used. The influence of these fertilizer and residual compost treatments on maize seed viability (germination), plant growth, reproductive development, pollen performance, grain yield parameters, yield and grain yield water-use efficiency was investigated. Higher seed viability was associated with balanced <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status (WNPK & NPK), whilst deficient <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status (0, N, P & K) resulted in lower seed viability. Plant growth (plant height, total dry mass and LAI) and reproductive development (tassel length, ear length, and days to tasseling and silking) were positively influenced by a balanced <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status and residual compost. Deficiencies in <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> restricted maize plant growth and delayed reproductive development. This highlighted {{the importance of a}} balanced <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status in attaining a vigorous crop and good reproductive development. <b>Soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> deficiencies (0, P & K treatments) enhanced the production of pollen (mass per plant), but resulted in low pollen quality (viability and germination). Balanced <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status (WNPK & NPK) resulted in the production of high quality pollen (viability and germinability), which however had a low mass. In both 2012 / 2013 and 2013 / 2014 seasons, maize grain components; cob length, number of kernel rows per cob, number of kernels per row, mass per kernel and mass of 100 kernels were positively influenced by balanced <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status. Grain yield and water use efficiency were also positively influenced by a balanced <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status (WNPK & NPK), whilst deficient <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status had a negative effect.

40|$|The Gonghe Basin {{region of}} the Tibet Plateau is {{severely}} affected by desertification. Compared with other desertified land, the main features of this region is windy, cold and short growing season, resulting in relatively difficult for vegetation restoration. In this harsh environment, identification the spatial <b>distribution</b> of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> and analysis its impact factors after vegetation establishment will be helpful for understanding the ecological relationship between soil and environment. Therefore, in this study, the 12 -year-old C. intermedia plantation on sand dunes {{was selected as the}} experimental site. Soil samples were collected under and between shrubs on the windward slopes, dune tops and leeward slopes with different soil depth. Then analyzed soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK). The results showed that the spatial heterogeneity of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> was existed in C. intermedia plantation on sand dunes. (1) Depth was the most important impact factor, <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> were decreased with greater soil depth. One of the possible reasons is that windblown fine materials and litters were accumulated on surface soil, when they were decomposed, more nutrients were aggregated on surface soil. (2) Topography also affected the <b>distribution</b> of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients,</b> more <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> distributed on windward slopes. The herbaceous coverage were higher and C. intermedia ground diameter were larger on windward slopes, both of them probably related to the high <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> level for windward slopes. (3) Soil "fertile islands" were formed, and the "fertile islands" were more marked on lower <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> level topography positions, while it decreased towards higher <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> level topography positions.

Experiments were conducted in the shelter forest lands drip-irrigated with underground saline water. Our results indicated that there are canonical correlations among <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients,</b> microbial amount and enzyme activity. The correlation between <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> and <b>soil</b> microbial biomass was mainly attributed to total nitrogen, organic matter, total phosphate of nutrient factors, and amount of actinomycetes, carbon and phosphate content in microbe. The correlation between <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> and <b>soil</b> enzyme activity was due to organic carbon, available potassium in soil and soil enzyme activities such as catalase activity and phosphatase activity. The correlation between soil microbial mass and activities of soil enzymes was due to phosphate and nitrogen contents in microbe and soil enzymes invertase and phosphatase activities. In addition to the correlations of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> and <b>soil</b> bio-activities, there is a vertical difference between these three factors in soil. We concluded that irrigation with saline groundwater had major effects on soil mineralization process.
