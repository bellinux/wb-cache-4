The aims of this study were to examine and compare the pharmacokinetic properties of the quinolones oxolinic acid, flumequine, <b>sarafloxacin,</b> and enrofloxacin after intravascular and oral administration to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) by using identical experimental designs. The study was performed in seawater at 10. 2 +/- 0. 2 degree C with Atlantic salmon weighing 240 +/- 50 g (mean +/- standard deviation). The bioavailability varied considerably among the four quinolones. Following oral administration of medicated feed, the bioavailabilities of oxolinic acid, flumequine, <b>sarafloxacin,</b> and enrofloxacin were 30. 1, 44. 7, 2. 2, and 55. 5 %, respectively. Taking the different dosages (25 mg/kg of body weight for oxolinic acid and flumequine and 10 mg/kg for <b>sarafloxacin</b> and enrofloxacin) into account, enrofloxacin showed the highest maximum concentration in plasma, followed by flumequine, oxolinic acid, and <b>sarafloxacin.</b> Following intravenous administration, the volumes of distribution at steady state of oxolinic acid, flumequine, <b>sarafloxacin,</b> and enrofloxacin were 5. 4, 3. 5, 2. 3, and 6. 1 liters/kg, respectively. Hence, all the quinolones showed good tissue penetration in Atlantic salmon. The elimination half-life of three of the quinolones, oxolinic acid, flumequine, and <b>sarafloxacin,</b> was {{less than or equal to}} 24 h, with oxolinic acid showing the shortest (18. 2 h). On the other hand, the elimination half-life of enrofloxacin was estimated to be 34. 2 h, almost twice that of oxolinic acid.

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the efficacy of}} continuous or pulsed-water medication with enrofloxacin, danofloxacin, and <b>sarafloxacin</b> in eight groups of 90 chicks each by using an infectious bronchitis virus-Escherichia coli model of colisepticemia. The model produced lesions of typical those occurring in birds with severe colisepticemia; for the infected, nonmedicated birds the mortality was 43. 5 % and the morbidity was 89 %, 17. 8 % of birds had severe lesions, and the birds had a mean air sac lesion score of 2. 58. This experiment showed that continuous dosing and pulsed dosing are clinically equivalent. However, for all fluoroquinolones studied, there was a trend for the continuously mediated birds to have lower mortality and less severe disease than birds receiving pulsed doses. Compared with infected, nonmedicated controls, only birds continuously medicated with enrofloxacin had a significantly lower morbidity (32 %), and only birds medicated with enrofloxacin and danofloxacin (continuous and pulsed treatments) had significantly lower mortality (6. 7 and 11. 0 % and 16. 8 and 19. 2 % for continuous and pulsed treatments with enrofloxacin and danofloxacin, respectively). A significantly lower proportion of birds only in the groups medicated with enrofloxacin had severe lesions (for birds receiving continuous and pulsed treatments, 2. 2 and 6. 7 %, respectively). Birds medicated {{with any of the}} three fluoroquinolones (continuous and pulsed treatments) except pulsed-water treatment with <b>sarafloxacin</b> had significantly reduced mean air sac lesion scores compared with the scores for nonmedicated birds (air sac lesion scores, 0. 60 and 0. 83, 1. 38 and 1. 63, and 1. 80 and 2. 05 for birds receiving continuous and pulsed treatments with enrofloxacin, danofloxacin, and <b>sarafloxacin,</b> respectively). The performance of the birds that survived the challenge or that recovered after receiving medication was not compromised compared to the performance of noninfected birds.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antimicrobial}} activities of oxolinic acid, flumequine, <b>sarafloxacin,</b> enrofloxacin, and oxytetracycline against strains of bacteria pathogenic to fish (Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, atypical A. salmonicida, Vibrio salmonicida, Vibrio anguillarum, and Yersinia ruckeri) were determined at two different incubation temperatures, 4 and 15 degrees C, by a drug microdilution method. The main {{objective of the}} study was to examine the effect of incubation temperature on the in vitro activities of 4 -quinolones and oxytetracycline against these bacteria. When tested against A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, all of the quinolones examined had MICs two- to threefold higher at 4 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. Similarly, 1. 5 - to 2 -fold higher MICs were recorded for all of the quinolones except <b>sarafloxacin</b> at 4 degrees C than at 15 degrees C when the drugs were tested against V. salmonicida. In contrast to those of the quinolones, the MICs of oxytetracycline were two- to eightfold lower at 4 degrees C than at 15 degrees C against all of the bacterial species tested. Of the antimicrobial agents tested against the bacterial species included in the study, enrofloxacin was the most active and oxytetracycline was the least active. <b>Sarafloxacin</b> was slightly more active than flumequine and oxolinic acid, especially against oxolinic acid-resistant A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida strains...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{indirect}} competitive ELISA (icELISA) {{method for}} multiresidue determination of Fluoroquinolones (FQs) residues in fish samples has been developed. For this purpose, <b>Sarafloxacin</b> (SAR) {{was employed to}} synthesize the immunogen and coating antigen through EDC conjugation method, and cell fusion technology was used to produce anti-SAR monoclonal antiobdy. Based on the square matrix titration, an icELISA method was established. The dynamic range for <b>Sarafloxacin</b> in assay buffer was from 0. 004 to 18 ng/mL, with LOD and IC 50 value of 0. 002 ng/mL and 0. 32 ng/mL, respectively. After optimization, the physiological pH (7. 4) was selected for the immunoassays, and this assay could tolerate up to 10 % acetonitrile. The results of this assay showed a high cross- reactivity to Difloxacin (85. 5 %), Norfloxacin (61. 7 %), and Pefloxacin (34. 8 %). Under the 10 -fold dilution in authentic fish samples, the regression curve equations for <b>Sarafloxacin,</b> Difloxacin, Norfloxacin and Pefloxacin were y= 1. 0114 x - 0. 4003, R 2 = 0. 9901; y= 0. 9782 x + 0. 2754, R 2 = 0. 9807; y= 0. 9892 x + 0. 0489, R 2 = 0. 9843; and y= 0. 9797 x + 0. 8017, R 2 = 0. 9844, respectively.

Difloxacin and <b>sarafloxacin</b> {{were evaluated}} for palatability, toxocity, and residues {{with respect to}} shrimp, after 15 days of feeding medicated diets. The pharmacokinetics and bioavailabilities of sulphadimethoxine (SDM) and ormetoprim (OMP) were also established for shrimp. Reductions (p < 0. 05) in difloxacin feed palatability were noted {{as a function of}} dose. Total survival and mean survival time (p < 0. 05) decreased as a function of dose. Signs of animal stress, i. e., lethargic behavior, was also noted in the highest dose group. Shrimp tissue levels of difloxacin were inconclusive and not readily determined with the current analytical methods for the drug in shrimp. However, indications were that elimination may be rapid, i. e., tissue t 1 / 2 of 11. 4 h with peak tissue levels following a standard dose response. Feed palatability was reduced (p < 0. 05) as a function of <b>sarafloxacin</b> dose. Lower weight gains in the higher dose groups were also noted. Neither the total survival nor the mean survival time (p < 0. 05) were affected by <b>sarafloxacin</b> dose. Feed Conversion Ratio's increased with dose, indicating possible subchronic toxicity. <b>Sarafloxacin</b> elimination was rapid, with a tissue t 1 / 2 of 13. 4 h and tissue levels decreased to below detectable limits by day 14 of withdrawal in all treatments. Peak tissue levels followed a standard dose response. The hemolymph concentrations versus time data for both SDM and OMP were fitted well by two compartment models. The SDM:OMP parameter estimates of CLs, Vss, and terminal phase t 1 / 2 were 194 : 2045 ml/kg*h, 1735 : 25, 442 ml/kg, and 6. 9 : 11. 5 h, respectively. Plasma protein binding of SDM and OMP was 5. 2 % and 12. 1 %, respectively. The bioavailabilities of SDM:OMP were 30 : 38 %.

40|$|Fluoroquinolones are {{commonly}} used to treat gastroenteritis caused by Campylobacter species. Domestically acquired fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter infection has been documented recently in the United States. It has been proposed {{that the increase in}} resistance is due, in part, to the use of fluoroquinolones in poultry. In separate experiments, the effects of <b>sarafloxacin</b> and enrofloxacin treatment of Campylobacter jejuni – infected chickens on the development of ciprofloxacin resistance were measured. Fecal samples were collected before and after treatment and were cultured for C. jejuni. When enrofloxacin or <b>sarafloxacin</b> was used at US Food and Drug Administration–approved doses in broiler chickens, resistance developed rapidly and persisted in C. jejuni. MICs of ciprofloxacin increased from a base of 0. 25 mg/mL to 32 mg/mL within the 5 -day treatment time frame.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the FQ resistance of 235 E. coli isolates recovered from chickens and turkeys. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by a microdilution method, whereas mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of the target genes, gyrA and parC, were detected by a PCR-based method. High resistance rates (> 60 %) were observed for nalidixic acid, flumequine, and difloxacin, whereas resistance to ciprofloxacin, danofloxacin, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, and <b>sarafloxacin</b> was less frequently reported (< 40 %). Sixty-four isolates (27. 2 %) showed full susceptibility toward the tested FQ, but 57 isolates (24. 2 %) were resistant to all tested FQ. The remaining 114 E. coli isolates (48. 5 %) were grouped in 5 different resistance patterns. Isolates resistant only to flumequine or nalidixic acid or both possessed 1 gyrA mutation, whereas isolates with further resistance to enrofloxacin, difloxacin, danofloxacin, and <b>sarafloxacin</b> had in addition 1 or 2 parC substitutions.

Experiments were conducted to evaluate the quantitative, fluorescent antibody technique (QFAT) {{that is used to}} detect, identify, and quantify both typical and 'bar form' Renibacterium salmoninarum cells. Smears of kidney tissue from naturally and artificially infected salmonids, both with and without chemotherapy, were quantitatively examined throughout the course of R. salmoninarum infections. Detection and quantification by QFAT has been reported to provide assessments of prevalence and severity of R. salmoninarum of individual fish. These assessments and the occurrence of 'bar forms' of R. salmoninarum have been used as an indication of recovery within a population. 'Bar forms' were observed in kidney tissue smears of fish that survived bacterial challenge when treated with erythromycin. The 'bar form' was also detected when rainbow trout were artificially infected with lower doses of live R. salmoninarum and in fish that were injected with irradiation-inactivated R. salmoninarum cells. By examining R. salmoninarum cultures in vitro by QFAT, it was determined that 'bar forms' did not occur on artificial media even when antibiotics were incorporated into the agar. When QFAT was compared to direct fluorescent antibody technique (DFAT) and quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), it was determined that QFAT had similar sensitivity as ELISA but was more sensitive than DFAT. QFAT was also used to predict minimum mortality. Experiments were also conducted to evaluate drug regimes to treat both artificial and natural R. salmoninarum infections. Erythromycin was administered by intraperitoneal injection in different doses and at selected days post infection. Erythromycin decreased percent mortality and increased mean day to death, but did not completely eradicate R. salmoninarum from infected test animals. <b>Sarafloxacin</b> and erythromycin were incorporated into daily ration of artificially infected test animals. Contrary to erythromycin, <b>sarafloxacin</b> did not decrease mortality or increase mean day to death when tested in vivo against R. salmoninarum. A new drug, A- 77143, was tested in vitro to determine if it was bactericidal and its minimum inhibitory concentration. When A- 77143 was compared to other antibiotics, it had a relatively low minimum inhibitory concentration and was shown to be bactericidal against the eight strains of R. salmoninarum tested...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} three analytical methods developed for the simultaneous determination of eight quinolones regulated by the European Union (marbofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, danofloxacin, enrofloxacin, difloxacin, <b>sarafloxacin,</b> oxolinic acid and flumequine) in pig muscle, using liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FD), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The procedures involve an extraction of the quinolones from the tissues, a step for clean-up and preconcentration of the analytes by solid-phase extraction and a subsequent liquid chromatographic analysis. The limits of detection of the methods ranged from 0. 1 to 2. 1 ng g− 1 using LC-FD, from 0. 3 to 1. 8 using LC-MS and from 0. 2 to 0. 3 using LC-MS/MS, while inter- and intra-day variability was under 15 % in all cases. Most of those data are notably lower than the maximum residue limits established by the European Union for quinolones in pig tissues. The methods have been applied for the determination of quinolones in six different commercial pig muscle samples purchased in different supermarkets located in the city of Granada (south-east Spain) ...|$|E
40|$|The primary photophysical {{properties}} of several antibiotic drugs of the fluoroquinolone class {{have been studied}} {{in order to understand}} better and rationalize the mechanisms leading to phototoxicity due to these drugs. The light absorption and emission {{properties of}} various fluoroquinolones have been characterized and, in most cases, they were found to be dependant on medium conditions such as pH and buffer content. Fluoroquinolones have been found capable of binding to DNA, affecting their emission from the excited state. Light-induced production of excited species by FQs and their subsequent reactivity are thus influenced by the characteristics of the medium. Finally, an unprecedented behaviour has been found for the triplet state of fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin, <b>sarafloxacin,</b> enoxacin norfloxacin when it is formed in the presence of certain inorganic salts commonly used as buffers. The triplet state formed {{at the end of the}} excitation pulse reacts with anions such as phosphate and bicarbonate to form another triplet state of lower energy. This previously unreported effect has implications in the photo toxic potential of fluoroquinolones in cellular environments. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{contribution}} {{reports on}} the spectroscopic characterization of antibacterial drugs from the group of the quinolones, bacterial DNA and the topoisomerase II enzyme gyrase; {{as well as on}} the spectroscopic observation of their interaction. The vibrational modes of the Raman spectra are assigned with the help of DFT calculation. Fluoroquinolones are the dominant gyrase inhibitors and play an important role amongst all prescribed antibacterial drugs. The target of the quinolones was found to be the bacterial DNA-gyrase-complex. The detailed mechanism of biological action on a molecular level is yet not fully understood, but of great interest [1]. A model of the proposed quinolone-DNA-gyrase-complex is shown in figure 1 a. The goal is to proof the model and to characterize the specific interactions of the single components with each other on a molecular level. In this study we report on spectroscopic investigations of a variety of gyrase inhibitors (nalidixic acid, oxolinic acid, cinoxacin, flumequine, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, <b>sarafloxacin</b> and moxifloxain). Raman spectra were recorded using micro-Raman techniques with excitation at different wavelengths, both in the off-resonant region (532 nm, 633 nm, 830 nm, 1064 nm, see figure 1 b) and in the absorption region (resonance Raman spectroscop...|$|E
40|$|EN] An {{assessment}} of the concentrations of thirteen different therapeutic pharmaceutical compounds was conducted on water samples obtained from different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) using solid phase extraction and high- and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-MS/MS and UHPLC-MS/MS), was carried out. The target compounds included ketoprofen and naproxen (anti-inflammatories), bezafibrate (lipid-regulating), carbamazepine (anticonvulsant), metamizole (analgesic), atenolol (?-blocker), paraxanthine (stimulant), fluoxetine (antidepressant), and levofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and <b>sarafloxacin</b> (fluoroquinolone antibiotics). The relative standard deviations obtained in method were below 11 %, while the detection and quantification limits were {{in the range of}} 0. 3 ? 97. 4 ng·L- 1 and 1. 1 ? 324. 7 ng·L- 1, respectively. The water samples were collected from two different WWTPs located on the island of Gran Canaria in Spain over a period of one year. The first WWTP (denoted as WWTP 1) used conventional activated sludge for the treatment of wastewater, while the other plant (WWTP 2) employed a membrane bioreactor system for wastewater treatment. Most of the pharmaceutical compounds detected in this study during the sampling periods were found to have concentrations ranging between 0. 02 and 34. 81 ?g·L- 1...|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{development}} and validation of a multiresidue method {{for the detection of}} 11 quinolones (marbofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, danofloxacin, lomefloxacin, enrofloxacin, <b>sarafloxacin,</b> difloxacin, oxolinic acid, nalidixic acid, flumequine) in muscle and eggs were reported. The method involved an extraction with a methanol/metaphosphoric acid mixture and a clean up by Oasis hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) cartridge. The validation was performed according to the Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC. Linearity, specificity, decision limit (CCα), detection capability (CCβ), recovery, precision (repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility), and ruggedness were determined. Depending on the analytes, CCα and CCβ ranged from 113 to 234 Â μg/kg and from 126 to 282 Â μg/kg in muscle samples, whereas in eggs, these parameters were between 5. 6 and 7. 4 Â μg/kg and between 6. 1 and 9. 8 Â μg/kg, respectively. In both the examined matrices, the recovery values were always higher than 90 Â % and precision, calculated as relative standard deviation, was equal to or lower than 16 Â % for repeatability and 23 Â % for within-laboratory reproducibility.

40|$|AbstractAn {{indirect}} competitive ELISA {{has been}} developed for the determination of Norfloxacin (NFLX) residue in chicken liver. For this reason, carbodiimide active ester method was employed to synthesize the artificial antigen of NFLXBSA, and coating antigen of NFLX-OVA, and rabbits were used to produce the anti-NFLX polyclonal antibody. Based on the square matrix titration, an icELISA method was developed for the quantitative detection of NFLX. The dynamic range was from 0. 006 to 38 ng/mL, with LOD and IC 50 value of 0. 004 ng/mL and 0. 48 ng/mL, respectively. Except for a high cross-reactivity to Ciprofloxacin (38 %) and <b>Sarafloxacin</b> (33 %), negligible cross-reactivity to the other compounds was observed. After optimization, 10 -fold dilution in chicken liver extract gave an inhibition curve almost {{the same as that}} in PBS buffer. When spiked in liver extract at 8, 20, and 50 ng/mL, the recovery rate was 90 - 117. 8 % for intra-assay, and 97. 5 - 114. 4 % for inter-assay, respectively. The relative standard deviation ranged from 5. 6 - 9. 2 % for intra-assay and 5. 9 - 11 % for inter-assay. Therefore, the developed icELISA method could be used for the routing screening of NFLX residues in chicken edible tissues...|$|E
