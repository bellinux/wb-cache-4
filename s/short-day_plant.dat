50|$|Quite a {{few players}} in this process are conserved across all the plants studied. Sometimes though, despite genetic conservation, the {{mechanism}} of action {{turns out to be}} different. For example, rice is a <b>short-day</b> <b>plant,</b> while Arabidopsis thaliana is a long-day plant. Now, in both plants, the proteins CO and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) are present. But, in Arabidopsis thaliana, CO enhances FT production, while in rice, the CO homolog represses FT production, resulting in completely opposite downstream effects.|$|E

50|$|Cockleburs are <b>short-day</b> <b>plants,</b> {{meaning they}} only {{initiate}} flowering when {{the days are}} getting shorter {{in the late summer}} and fall, typically from July to October in the Northern Hemisphere. They can also flower in the tropics where the daylength is constant.|$|R
50|$|Florigen {{was first}} {{described}} by Soviet Armenian plant physiologist Mikhail Chailakhyan, who in 1937 demonstrated that floral induction {{can be transmitted}} through a graft from an induced plant to one {{that has not been}} induced to flower. Anton Lang showed that several long-day plants and biennials could be made to flower by treatment with gibberellin, when grown under a non-flower-inducing (or non-inducing) photoperiod. This led to the suggestion that florigen may be made up of two classes of flowering hormones: Gibberellins and Anthesins. It was later postulated that during non-inducing photoperiods, long-day plants produce anthesin, but no gibberellin while <b>short-day</b> <b>plants</b> produce gibberellin but no anthesin. However, these findings did not account for the fact that <b>short-day</b> <b>plants</b> grown under non-inducing conditions (thus producing gibberellin) will not cause flowering of grafted long-day plants that are also under noninductive conditions (thus producing anthesin).|$|R

50|$|Artemisia annua {{belongs to}} the plant family of Asteraceae and is an annual <b>short-day</b> <b>plant.</b> Its stem is erect {{brownish}} or violet brown. The plant itself is hairless and naturally grows from 30 to 100 cm tall, although in cultivation {{it is possible for}} plants to reach a height of 200 cm. The leaves of A. annua have a length of 3-5 cm and are divided by deep cuts into two or three small leaflets. The intensive aromatic scent of the leaves is characteristic. The Artemisinin content in dried leaves is in between 0% and 1.5%. New hybrids of Artemisia annua developed in Switzerland can reach a leaf artemisinin content of up to 2%. The small flowers have a diameter of 2-2.5 mm and are arranged in loose panicles. Their color is green-yellowish. The seeds are brown achenes with a diameter of only 0.6-0.8 mm. Their thousand-kernel weight (TKW) averages around 0.03 g (in comparison, wheat has a TKW of approximately 45 g).|$|E
5000|$|In 1920, W. W. Garner and H. A. Allard {{published}} their discoveries on photoperiodism {{and felt}} it was the length of daylight that was critical, but it was later discovered that {{the length of the}} night was the controlling factor. Photoperiodic flowering plants are classified as long-day <b>plants</b> or <b>short-day</b> <b>plants</b> even though night is the critical factor because of the initial misunderstanding about daylight being the controlling factor. Along with long-day <b>plants</b> and <b>short-day</b> <b>plants,</b> there are plants that fall into a [...] "dual-day length category". These plants are either long-short-day plants (LSDP) or short-long-day plants (SLDP). LSDPs flower after a series of long days followed by short days whereas SLDPs flower after a series of short days followed by long days. [...] Each plant has a different length critical photoperiod, or critical night length.|$|R
50|$|<b>Short-day</b> <b>plants</b> flower {{when the}} night lengths exceed their {{critical}} photoperiod. They cannot flower under short nights or if a pulse of artificial light is shone {{on the plant}} for several minutes during the night; they require a continuous period of darkness before floral development can begin. Natural nighttime light, such as moonlight or lightning, is not of sufficient brightness or duration to interrupt flowering.|$|R
50|$|The plants grow {{mainly by}} {{vegetative}} reproduction: two daughter plants bud {{off from the}} adult plant. This form of growth allows very rapid colonisation of new water. Duckweeds are flowering plants, and {{nearly all of them}} are known to reproduce sexually, flowering and producing seed under appropriate conditions. Certain duckweeds (such as L. gibba) are long-day plants, while others (such as L. minor) are <b>short-day</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R
50|$|The growth habit, size, and {{proportions}} of maca are roughly {{similar to those}} of radishes and turnips, to which it is related. The green, fragrant tops are short and lie along the ground. The thin, frilly leaves sprout in a rosette at the soil surface, not growing more than 12-20 cm in height. The leaves show a dimorphism according to reproductive stage. They are more prominent in the vegetative phase, and are continuously renewed from the center as the outer leaves die. The off-white, self-fertile flowers are borne on a central raceme, and are followed by 4-5 mm siliculate fruits, each containing two small 2.0-2.5 mm reddish-gray ovoid seeds. Seeds are the maca’s only means of reproduction. Maca reproduces mainly through self-pollination and is an autogamous species. The genome consists of 64 chromosomes. From experiments with different day lengths, maca is a <b>short-day</b> <b>plant.</b> Some sources consider the maca to be an annual plant, as in favorable years it can complete a lifecycle within a year.|$|E
5000|$|Phytochrome {{comes in}} two forms: pr and pfr. Red light (which is present during the day) {{converts}} phytochrome to its active form (pfr). This then triggers {{the plant to}} grow. In turn, far-red light {{is present in the}} shade or in the dark and this converts phytochrome from pfr to pr. Pr is the inactive form of phytochrome and will not allow for plant growth. This system of pfr to pr conversion allows the plant to sense when it is night and when it is day. [...] Pfr can also be convereted back to Pr by a process known as dark reversion, where long periods of darkness trigger the conversion of Pfr. This is important in regards to plant flowering. Experiments by Halliday et al. showed that manipulations of the red-to far-red ratio in Arabidopsis can alter flowering. They discovered that plants tend to flower later when exposed to more red light, proving that red light is inhibitory to flowering. Other experiments have proven this by exposing plants to extra red-light {{in the middle of the}} night. A <b>short-day</b> <b>plant</b> will not flower if light is turned on for a few minutes in the middle of the night and a long-day plant can flower if exposed to more red-light in the middle of the night.|$|E
50|$|P. ahipa is {{member of}} the Fabaceae and {{predominantly}} self-pollinating. The Andean bean is a perennial plant and can grow in erect, semierect or twining forms. The erect species can grow to 15-40 cm tall, the semierect one about 30-60 cm, and the twining forms 60-200 cm long. These plants are herbaceous and lignified depending on the genotype. They do not show a lateral axis. The leaves are trifoliate with stipules or pinnately arranged leaflets with caduceus stipels. The flowers, which grow on short stalks, are white blossoms or of a pale lavender colour. They show a tubular calyx and a papilionaceous corolla. Generally, the flowers exhibit an internally curved stigma {{in close contact with}} the anthers. This habitus is very unfavourable in connection with the pollination behaviour of insects, as they are not able to pollinate the flowers very effectively. Additionally, the pollen fertility is often not very high. It varies between 45 and 100%. The flowering pattern is not consistent. Each season, 100 - 800 flowers per plant can be produced. P. ahipa is a <b>short-day</b> <b>plant,</b> so flowering takes place under decreasing day length. The pods are 13-17 cm long and up to 16 mm wide. The seeds are black, lilac, maroon, or black and white mottled. They are round, kidney-shaped, and about 0.8-1 cm long. Seed production differs from plant to plant and lies between 20 and 100 per plant. The thousand grain weight is around 300 g.|$|E
40|$|Many {{plant species}} are {{sensitive}} {{to changes in the}} seasons, especially with regard to their reproductive behaviour. Sexual or vegetative reproductive structures are often only formed at times of the year when days are sufficiently long, or short. Plants perceive daylength in the leaves, but reproductive changes occur in shoot apices in response to the movement of signals throughout the plant. There is good evidence that phytochrome A is an essential component of the daylength-sensing mechanism in long-day plants, and preliminary evidence suggests a potential interaction between phytochrome C and daylength sensitivity in <b>short-day</b> <b>plants.</b> The sensitivity of reproductive processes to photoperiodic control is directly altered by photoreceptor action, particularly in the case of phytochrome B, which has a major influence on whether flowering or tuberization occurs under non-inductive conditions in both long- and <b>short-day</b> <b>plants,</b> but is not involved in daylength measurement. The signals which move from leaves to the sites of reproductive development are not known, but there is good evidence that gibberellins may be important and some preliminary indication that brassinosteroids might also be involved in photoperiodic signallin...|$|R

50|$|S. rostrata can be {{propagated}} vegetatively (from stem-cuttings or ratooning) or from seed. It takes 50 to 60 days to grow. Plants propagated from cuttings grow 2 to 2.5 {{times faster}} than seeded plants in the first 42 days. S. rostrata grows naturally in waterlogged and alluvial soils. It tolerates freely drained, poorly drained, and flooded soils with moderate fertility, though it does not grow well in heavy clay soils. S. rostrata tolerates a pH down to 4.3 to slightly alkaline, but nitrogen-fixation is reduced in acidic conditions. It is adapted to low and moderate salinity but seed germination and growth decreases as salinity concentration increases. The ideal water requirement is 600-1000 mm rainfall. It is a tropical plant with an optimal temperature of 25° C.The addition of lime in highly acidic soils and phosphorus in soils with low fertility improves growth and nitrogen fixation of S. rostrata. It fixes large amounts of nitrogen in only 6-8 weeks if the appropriate strain of Azorhizobium caulinodans {{is present in the}} soil. S. rostrata is a <b>short-day</b> <b>plant</b> with a day length of 12-12.5 hrs. During shorter day lengths it flowers earlier, however, when day lengths are longer than 12 hrs, then it flowers later. Its use as a green manure is limited to that part of the year with longer day lengths because during this period vegetative growth is extended and more biomass is produced.|$|E
50|$|Finger millet is a <b>short-day</b> <b>plant</b> with {{a growing}} optimum at 12 h daylenght for most varieties. Its main growing area ranges from 20° N to 20° S, meaning mainly the {{semiarid}} to arid tropics. Nevertheless, finger millet {{is found to be}} grown at 30° N in the Himalaya region (India and Nepal). It is generally considered as a drought tolerant crop. But compared with other millets, such as pearl millet and sorghum it preferes moderate rainfall (≥500 mm annually). The majority of worldwide finger millet farmers grow it rainfed, although yields often can be significantly improved when irrigation is applied. In India, finger millet is a typical rabi (= dry season) crop. Heat tolerance of finger millet is high. For Ugandan finger millet varieties for instance, the optimal average growth temperature ranges at about 27 °C, while the minimal temperatures shouldn't be lower than 18 °C. Relatively to other millet species (pearl millet and sorghum) finger millet has a higher tolerance to cool temperatures. It is grown from about 500 meters above sea level up to about 2400 meters above sea level (e.g. in Himalaya region). By that, it can be cultivated on higher elevations than most tropical crops. Finger millet can grow on various soils, including highly weathered tropical lateritic soils. Furthermore, it can tolerate soil salinity up to a certain extent. Its ability to bear waterlogging is limited, therefore good drainage of the soils and moderate water holding capacity are optimal. Finger millet can tolerate moderately acidic soils (pH 5) but also moderately alkaline soils (pH 8.2).|$|E

50|$|Much {{emphasis}} is placed on photoperiod when discussing plant development. However, it is the number of hours of darkness that affects a plant’s response to day length.In general, a “short-day” is one in which the photoperiod is no more than 12 hours.

40|$|Phytochromes confer the {{photoperiodic}} {{control of}} flowering in rice (Oryza sativa), a <b>short-day</b> <b>plant.</b> To {{better understand the}} molecular mechanisms of day-length recognition, we examined the interaction between phytochrome signals and circadian clocks in photoperiodic-flowering mutants of rice. Monitoring behaviors of circadian clocks revealed that phase setting of circadian clocks is not affected either under short-day (SD) or under long-day (LD) conditions in a phytochrome-deficient mutant that shows an early-flowering phenotype with no photoperiodic response. Non- 24 -hr-light/dark-cycle experiments revealed that a rice counterpart gene of Arabidopsis CONSTANS (CO), named PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY 1 (Heading date 1) [SE 1 (Hd 1) ], functions as an output of circadian clocks. In addition, the phytochrome deficiency {{does not affect the}} diurnal mRNA expression of SE 1 upon floral transition. Downstream floral switch genes were further identified with rice orthologs of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). Our RT-PCR data indicate that phytochrome signals repress mRNA expression of FT orthologs, whereas SE 1 can function to promote and suppress mRNA expression of the FT orthologs under SD and LD, respectively. This SE 1 transcriptional activity may be posttranscriptionally regulated and may depend on the coincidence with Pfr phytochromes.

There are however concerns about the carcinogenicity of some of these growth regulators.

40|$|This {{study is}} about how changed light {{conditions}} induce dormancy in plants. It is divided in two parts. First a literature study where quantification of light, the concept dormancy, photoperiod and light quality are discussed. Second an experimental part, where the importance of light for sprouting capacity in root buds of perennial sow thistle (Sonchus arvensis L.) is investigated. In the science in how flowering in plants are induced the concepts short day/long day plants and light dominant/dark dominant are well-established. These concepts can also be applied to how light induce dormancy in plants. Plants are divided into <b>short-day</b> <b>plants</b> and long-day plants depending on if endodormancy is induced when day length is longer than a critical threshold value (long-day plants) or shorter than a critical threshold value (<b>short-day</b> <b>plants).</b> Plants can detect both light quality and photon irradiance. Both decrease in the dusk and can therefore be of importance to denote the day length. For {{the most of the}} plants that has been studied, it has been showed that it is the duration of night length (dark dominant) that is important not the daylight as the classification (short-day/long-day) might trick you to believe. But it also exist plants that the duration of the light is important (light dominant), even then they is less common. Studies in spruce (Picea abies) have showed that light quality might be important for how dormancy is induced. So it is many aspects of lights that theoretically can be of importance for how dormancy is induced in plants. Earlier studies have shown that perennial sow thistle has a dormancy stage in autumn. This reduces the sprouting capacity after fragmentation and makes the plant less vulnerable to mechanical control at autumn. In the experimental part perennial sow thistle was exposed to three treatments: (i) long-day with low intensity (18 / 6 light/dark, photon irradiance 324 μmol/m 2 s), (ii) short-day with low intensity (12 / 12 h light/dark, photon irradiance 324 μmol/m 2 s) and (iii) short-day with high intensity (12 / 12 h light/dark, photon irradiance 485 μmol/m 2 s). Sprouting capacity was evaluated based on proportion of sprouting buds from short fragments. Neither of the daylength treatments used here had any significant effect on sprouting capacity. Sprouting capacity was higher when the irradiance was low. This was not expected and is probably not the cause of dormancy induction in perennial sow thistle...|$|R
