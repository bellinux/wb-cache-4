25|$|A {{buffer strip}} {{is an area}} of land {{maintained}} in permanent vegetation that helps to control air, soil, and water quality, along with other environmental problems, dealing primarily on land that is used in agriculture. Buffer strips trap sediment, and enhance filtration of nutrients and pesticides by slowing down runoff that could enter the local surface waters. The root systems of the planted vegetation in these buffers hold soil particles together which alleviate the soil of wind erosion and stabilize stream banks providing protection against substantial erosion and landslides. Farmers can also use buffer strips to <b>square</b> <b>up</b> existing crop fields to provide safety for equipment while also farming more efficiently.|$|E
