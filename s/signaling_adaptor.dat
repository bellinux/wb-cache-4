Previously in 2003, a Japanese team had already demonstrated several genes involved in NF-kappaB activation. Shu's team discovered that over-expression of one of these genes had a strong effect on IRF3 activation. Through a series of experiments, they discovered that the product of this gene greatly influences TLR3-independent IFN-β signaling. It was named VISA (virus-induced <b>signaling</b> <b>adaptor).</b> It can also interact with TRIF and TRAF6, and plays an essential role in virus-triggered TLR3-independent and TLR3-mediated antiviral IFN signaling. In 2008 they discovered another adaptor protein, MITA, through expression cloning. MITA is related to VISA, and has the ability to mediate virus-triggered IRF3 activation and IFN expression. Their later studies showed that by ubiquitination and degradation of MITA, E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF5 can negatively regulate cellular antiviral signaling.|$|E

Tumors showed extensive squamous differentiation, a phenotype commonly seen with activation of the canonical β-catenin signaling pathway.

40|$|Transmembrane <b>signaling</b> <b>adaptor</b> DAP 12 has {{increasingly}} been recognized for its {{important role in}} innate responses. However, {{its role in the}} regulation of antimicrobial T cell responses has remained unknown. In our current study, we have examined host defense, T cell responses, and tissue immunopathology in models of intracellular infection established in wild-type and DAP 12 -deficient mice. During mycobacterial infection, lack of DAP 12 leads to pronounced proinflammatory and Th 1 cytokine responses, overactivation of Ag-specific CD 4 and CD 8 T cells of type 1 phenotype, and heightened immunopathology both in the lung and lymphoid organs. DAP 12 -deficient airway APC display enhanced NF-B activation and cytokine responses upon TLR stimulation or mycobacterial infection in vitro. Of importance, adoptive transfer of Ag-loaded DAP 12 -deficient APC alone could lead to overactivation of transferred transgenic or endogenous wild-type T cells in vivo. We have further found that the immune regu-latory role by DAP 12 is not restricted only to intracellular bacterial infection, since lack of this molecule also leads to uncontrolled type 1 T cell activation and severe immunopathology and tissue injury during intracellular viral infection. Our study thus identifies DAP 12 as an important novel immune regulatory molecule that acts, via APC, to control the level of antimicrobial type 1 T cell activation and immunopathology.

40|$|Background/Aims: After {{treatment}} with heat-killed Propionibacterium acnes mice show dense hepatic granuloma formation. Such mice develop liver injury in an interleukin (IL) - 18 -dependent manner after challenge with a sublethal dose LPS. As previously shown, LPS-stimulated Kupffer cells secrete IL- 18 depending on caspase- 1 and Toll-like receptor (TLR) - 4 but independently of its <b>signal</b> <b>adaptor</b> myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD 88), suggesting importance of another <b>signal</b> <b>adaptor</b> TIR domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-beta (TRIF). Nalp 3 inflammasome reportedly controls caspase- 1 activation. Here we investigated {{the roles of}} MyD 88 and TRIF in P. acnes-induced hepatic granuloma formation and LPS-induced caspase- 1 activation for IL- 18 release. Methods:Mice were sequentially treated with P. acnes and LPS, and their serum IL- 18 levels and liver injuries were determined by ELISA and ALT/AST measurement, respectively. Active caspase- 1 in LPS-stimulated Kupffer cells was determined by Western blotting. Results: Macrophage-ablated mice lacked P. acnes-induced hepatic granuloma formation and LPS-induced serum IL- 18 elevation and liver injury. Myd 88 (-/-) Kupffer cells, but not Trif(-/-) cells, exhibited normal caspase- 1 activation upon TLR 4 engagement in vitro. Myd 88 (-/-) mice failed to develop hepatic granulomas after P. acnes treatment and liver injury induced by LPS challenge. In contrast, Trif(-/-) mice normally formed the hepatic granulomas, but could not release IL- 18 or develop the liver injury. Nalp 3 (-/-) mice showed the same phenotypes of Trif(-/-) mice. Conclusions: Propionibacterium acnes treatment MyD 88 -dependently induced hepatic granuloma formation. Subsequent LPS TRIF-dependently activated caspase- 1 via Nalp 3 inflammasome and induced IL- 18 release, eventually leading to the liver injury.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs), key players in innate immunity, are upregulated in atherosclerotic lesions, but their functional role in human atherosclerosis is unknown. We explored the effects of blocking TLR- 2, TLR- 4, and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD 88), a <b>signaling</b> <b>adaptor</b> shared by most TLRs and interleukin- 1 receptor (IL- 1 R), in an in vitro model of human atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Carotid endarterectomies were obtained from patients with symptomatic carotid disease. Cells were isolated via enzymatic tissue dissociation and cultured in {{the presence or absence}} of TLR signaling blockers. A dominant-negative form of MyD 88 (MyD 88 (DN)) decreased the production of monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 /CCL 2 (P= 0. 000), IL- 8 /CXCL 8 (P= 0. 006), IL- 6 (P= 0. 002), matrix metalloproteinase- 1 (MMP- 1; P= 0. 002), and MMP- 3 (P= 0. 000), as well as nuclear factor-kappaB activation (P< 0. 05) in atheroma cell cultures. IL- 1 R antagonist, TLR- 4 blocking antibodies, or overexpression of a dominant-negative form of the TLR- 4 <b>signaling</b> <b>adaptor</b> TRIF-related adaptor molecule reduced nuclear factor-kappaB activity but did not have a broad impact on the production of the mediators studied. In contrast, TLR- 2 neutralizing antibodies inhibited nuclear factor-kappaB activation (P< 0. 05) and significantly reduced monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 /CCL 2 (P= 0. 000), IL- 8 /CXCL 8 (P= 0. 009), IL- 6 (P= 0. 000), and MMP- 1 (P= 0. 000), MMP- 2 (P= 0. 004), MMP- 3 (P= 0. 000), and MMP- 9 (P= 0. 006) production.
