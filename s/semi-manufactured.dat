40|$|The {{present study}} has been {{conducted}} in the year 2008 to assess the determinants of exports in Pakistan during 1970 - 2006 using econometric techniques. Time series data ranging from 1970 to 2006 on total exports, primary commodities exports, <b>semi-manufactures</b> and exports of manufactured goods has been taken from Economic Survey of Pakistan (Statistical Supplement, 2006 - 07). Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test {{has been used for}} checking the stationarity of the data. Furthermore, the Johenson Co-integration test (likelihood ratio statistic) has been used to detect the long-term relationship among the series. The method of ordinary least square has been used to assess the determinants of exports in Pakistan. The results indicate that 1 % increase in the exports of primary commodities brings 0. 97 % increase in total exports in Pakistan. Similarly, 1 % increase in the exports of <b>semi-manufactures</b> leads to increase total exports by 0. 99 %.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the ongoing interactions that take place between buyers and sellers of business services after the contract has been signed. This ongoing interaction is important since services are produced and consumed simultaneously; therefore, both buyer and seller {{have to make an}} effort to ensure that the ongoing service exchange is successful. We adopt the Interaction Model originally developed by the Industrial Marketing and Purchasing Group for studying buyer-supplier interactions in marketing and purchasing of industrial goods, and adapt this to business services. As such, we bring forward a classification that differentiates between various business services and the required customer-supplier interface and interaction patterns on the basis of how the service is used / applied in the buying company’s business process. The classification distinguishes four types of service application: components, <b>semi-manufactures,</b> instruments and consumables. In two subsequent series of theory-building case studies, we developed effective patterns of interaction {{for each of the four}} service types. As such, the classification of business services has been developed into a typology of effective buyer-seller interaction. We demonstrate that this effective buyer-seller interaction is a necessary condition for successful ongoing service exchange.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose – Most {{existing}} classifications {{of business}} services {{have taken the}} perspective of the supplier as opposed to that of the buyer. To address this imbalance, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to propose a classification of business services based on how the buying company applies the service with respect to its own business processes. Design/methodology/approach – The paper considers some specific aspects of the process of buying and exchanging business services, focusing on the everyday production and consumption of services as opposed to the initial purchasing and negotiation phases. Findings – Earlier literature has developed similar, albeit less elaborate classifications, but does not provide detailed insight into how such classifications are related to differentiated buyer-supplier interaction. This classification distinguishes between four business service applications; as a component, <b>semi-manufacture,</b> instrument or consumable. For each of these four types of services, interaction has to achieve different objectives and consequently they differ with regards to required organizational resources in terms of required capabilities and buyer-supplier interfaces. Research limitations/implications – Primarily conceptual and exploratory in nature, this paper is intended as a review of existing literature and possible starting point for further empirical validation and theoretical refinement. The paper contends that the differences in application have a significant impact on interaction patterns, but this is not to say that other variables have no impact on buyer-supplier interaction patterns. Subsequent research should seek to control for those other possible sources of variation. Practical implications – The overall implication of this classification is that for different services, the buying company should assess how they are applied. Subsequently, it is relevant for firms to consider what functional aspects are crucial and who are likely to become, or who should be involved and to what extent, in the purchasing decision process and in the interactions that take place after the decision has been made...|$|R

40|$|Folate {{concentrations}} in berries and berry products were investigated, determining folate retention from raw {{material to the}} final product. Folate content was quantified using a modified and systematically evaluated radioprotein-binding assay (RPBA). The optimised RPBA was demonstrated to be a useful method for folate quantification in berries containing mainly 5 -CH₃-H₄folate. Results after internal evaluation regarding selectivity, background radiation, unspecific binding, and accuracy are presented. To avoid unspecific binding purification of sample extracts by solid phase extraction prior to quantification was included for some berries. Microbiological assay (MA) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to compare obtained folate concentrations and to characterise individual folate forms in tested matrices. The predominating folate form in all tested berries was 5 -CH₃-H₄folate. Therefore, the recently commercially available natural form (6 S) - 5 -CH₃-H₄folate was chosen as calibrant. Berries rich in folate were rosehips (100 - 180 µg/ 100 g fresh weight) and strawberries (70 - 90 µg/ 100 g fresh weight). These two model berries were used to study factors affecting the folate content in berries. Significant effects on folate content were observed from cultivar, grade of ripeness and year of harvest. Folate retention in the two model berries was studied during storage, drying procedures and in commercial products. After storage of fresh strawberries in the refrigerator high folate retention was obtained, whereas storage in room temperature and at exposure to light resulted in folate losses. In rosehips folate retention during various drying procedures was improved by minimising the drying time using high temperature and cutting of berries into slices. Water content affected the stability of both folates and ascorbic acid during drying. Almost no folate losses occurred when strawberries were cooked as jam or stewed as strawberry desserts from frozen berries, with a folate retention of 79 - 103 %. Commercial products from both berries contained 10 - 20 µg of folate per 100 g FW. Berries and <b>semi-manufactures</b> of berries are suitable ingredients in various food products to increase their nutritional value regarding folate intake.

40|$|In {{the context}} of its regular {{business}} cycle monitoring and forecasting exercise WIFO in late 1994 sampled some 3, 000 manufacturing, construction, and public utility companies for their investment plans. The results suggest that in these sectors aggregate investment continued falling in 1994, by an estimated 5 percent (to a total of Sch 84. 5 billion). Plans for 1995 provide for an increase by 13 percent. Including estimates {{for the rest of}} the economy, total gross fixed investment is projected to expand by 7 ½ percent in nominal and 5 percent in real values, thereby giving support to the business cycle recovery under way. In manufacturing industry, investment has been declining for the last three years, in 1994 by 5 percent in volume. The investment ratio (as percent of turnover) fell from 7. 4 percent in 1992 to 5. 6 percent in 1994, confirming the usual time lag of investment vis-à-vis the pick-up in final demand and output. Capacity utilization, while rising from 81 percent to 83 percent, still remains below the long-term average. According to the new plans, industrial investment is set to rise by 8 percent volume in 1995. This rebound, a consequence of the rise in demand since mid- 1993, is still cautious due to the persistent substantial amount of spare capacity. Rationalization remains the dominant motive for capital spending for 39 percent of firms, although the share of those citing capacity enlargement has increased from 23 percent to 27 percent. Industrial employment, which fell by more than 3 percent in 1994, may still not have reached a turning point. The strongest rebound in investment is likely to occur in the basic and <b>semi-manufactures</b> industries (oil, steel, non-ferrous metals). This sector was hit the most by the past recession and has to make substantial efforts to secure its competitiveness. Investment propensity remains moderate for the time being in the fast-rising sector of technical manufactures, and appears to be further weakening in the textile branches. Investment spending in the construction industry, having stagnated in the previous year, is estimated to increase by 4 percent and 6 percent (current values), respectively, in 1994 and 1995. Survey responses from electricity companies suggest a rise by 4 ½ percent for 1994 and by 23 percent for 1995. Investitionstätigkeit kommt in Schwung.

40|$|Recovery {{continued}} {{over the}} summer and into early fall without accelerating. Exports remain the driving force for increased capacity utilization and a brightening investment climate. Continued lively domestic demand gives the upturn a broader base but, together with disappointing net receipts from summer tourism, acts as a drag on the current external account. Having passed its trough about a year ago, business activity in Austria {{is still in the}} early stage of a moderate upturn. Its further course will be largely determined by developments abroad as foreign demand is typically the growth engine {{at this stage of the}} cycle. Exports have recently been strong towards some eastern neighbor countries, the former Soviet Union, and overseas markets. The Austrian supply structure with its relatively large share of <b>semi-manufactures</b> and highly competitive machine tools and other investment goods sector was conducive to a reinforcement of market shares. On the traditional markets in Western Europe performance was mixed. Past exchange rate shifts and sluggish domestic demand in Germany exerted a dampening effect. Moreover, the sweeping rationalization and cost-cutting measures in the German automobile industry may, on the whole, not have benefited Austrian suppliers. The order situation suggests further export and output growth for the months ahead. In many European countries demand buoyancy has extended from exports to private investment. Wage moderation and rising capacity utilization have boosted corporate profitability, such that comparatively high real interest rates should not impede the recovery, at least not in the short run. Domestic demand continues to rise although activity in the construction sector has slackened since last spring. Income gains from tax cuts have to a large extent been either saved or spent on services, particularly foreign travel. Retail sales of consumer durables have so far remained subdued as households expect price cuts after accession to the EU. The labor market has reacted relatively quickly to the rebound in output. The construction sector, retail trade, and many other services are hiring new labor and, even in manufacturing, personnel cuts have come to a halt. In November, registered unemployment fell by 14, 400 year-on-year. Price stabilization has made slow progress in recent months. In October, the annual inflation rate fell below 3 percent. Housing costs and service prices have posted above-average increases throughout the recession; but also for manufactures, inflation is relatively strong given the altogether stable import and producer prices.

30|$|The modern service {{industry}} {{is an important}} component of the national economy, and accelerating the development of the modern {{service industry}} is an important way to expand domestic demand and transform the pattern of economic development. In general, the development of China's modern service industry is still at a low level, and current taxation system and policies are not conducive to its development. The pilot work of changing sales tax to a value-added tax (VAT) is of great importance to eliminating double taxation in the area of the modern service industry, reducing its tax burden, pushing manufacturing enterprises to voluntarily divest producer services, and increasing the supply of producer services. It is imperative to carry out the reform of changing sales tax to a VAT, but since the current VAT was designed based on the features of manufacturing, simple reproduction of it for the service industry on which sales tax is currently levied is obviously too simple, for there are fundamental differences between the process of production and the operation of the service industry and that of manufacturing. In manufacturing, production mainly relies on physical materials including raw materials, fuels, power, <b>semi-manufactures,</b> and so on, and in the current VAT system, after the deductions are made, the object of taxation is basically the added value of products. However, in the service industry, a great deal of production and operation does not rely primarily on the consumption of materials, but on that of non-material human capital and intangible assets including ‘taste,’ ‘originality,’ and so on (Gao 2012). If labor costs in the service industry cannot be deducted, it is possible that the burden of some modern service industries would be heavier than that before the reform, which obviously runs counter to the intent of the reform. For the purpose of encouraging the development of the modern service industry, it has been suggested that intangible assets, human capital, and so on be included in the scope of VAT deduction as early as possible. In addition, there is no explicit instruction in the reform plan of ‘changing sales tax to VAT’ for tax exemption of service exports. Taxes are levied on service products exported from China and compared with the service industry in countries where a VAT is levied on the service industry, the service industry in China is in a disadvantageous position in the international market. In order to strengthen the competitiveness of China's service industry in the international market, especially in the producer services trade, specific measures and rules for the implementation of exempting, deducting and reimbursing taxes levied on the service industry must be worked out as soon as possible.|$|R
40|$|The {{regional}} {{business cycle}} pattern in Austria in 1995 {{was shaped by}} the strong performance of the export-oriented manufacturing industries in the first half-year. Locations with strong concentration on the production of consumer goods and services fared comparatively less well. Despite {{the problems in the}} tourism sector, the western region achieved markedly stronger output growth (+ 2. 6 percent in volume) than the South (+ 1. 8 percent) and East (+ 1. 6 percent). In manufacturing, traditional industrial sites in Upper Austria (output + 9. 5 percent) and Styria (+ 9. 3 percent), but also in Carinthia (+ 4. 6 percent) benefited for most of the year from growing demand for <b>semi-manufactures</b> and investment goods as is typical for the early stage of recovery. However, eastern regions with production concentrated on consumer goods found little scope for expansion. In tourism, structural problems and external constraints led to further output losses in major target areas in the West (overnight stays in the state of Salzburg – 5. 5 percent, in Tyrol – 4. 8 percent) and the South (Carinthia – 5. 2 percent). Only the city tourism (Vienna + 1. 4 percent) posted further gains. Less export-oriented industries remained under the influence of rather sluggish internal demand. Retail sales in Carinthia and Styria fell slightly, due to increased cross-border shopping following the devaluation of the Italian Lira; in the Eastern region (Burgenland – 6. 6 percent, Vienna – 1. 8 percent) price differentials vis-à-vis neighboring transition countries caused shifts in purchasing power to these countries, since they have also made progress in upgrading the quality of goods supplied; retailers in the state of Salzburg (– 4. 7 percent) and in Tyrol (– 2. 2 percent) suffered from the fewer number of tourists from abroad. Construction output also fell nearly everywhere, except in Vienna (+ 3. 3 percent) and Upper Austria (+ 5. 3 percent). The regional spread of GDP growth, measured at the Federal state level, has been substantial, with those states showing a high share of manufacturing industry taking the lead (Upper Austria + 4. 0 percent, Styria + 2. 9 percent, Lower Austria + 2. 5 percent, Vorarlberg + 2. 1 percent). States with a relatively high share of services production fared less well (Tyrol + 1. 5 percent, Vienna + 1. 3 percent, Salzburg + 1. 0 percent). "Losers" were the structurally weaker states of Carinthia (– 0. 4 percent) and Burgenland (– 2. 3 percent). The differential between the Austrian NUTS-II regions has thus become somewhat wider in 1995. Frühzeitige Konjunkturwende bestimmt regionale Entwicklung.

Foreign trade of the EU is heavily concentrated: the three largest countries (Germany, France, United Kingdom) account {{for more than half of}} total exports; the largest six countries account for more than four fifths (81 percent) of EU exports. About one fourth of EU exports originate in Germany alone. The EU countries conduct the major part of their foreign trade with each other. Intra-EU exports total 63 percent of total exports of the EU; intra-EU imports total 61 percent of total imports of the EU. With a share of 65 percent, Austria's integration into the EU is slightly above average. Even though Austria is one of the smaller EU countries, countries which as a rule are intensively engaged in trade, the relation of exports to GDP was only 22. 7 percent, slightly above the EU average (22. 3 percent). The EU's exports to countries outside the EU (extra-EU exports) amounted to 8. 4 percent of GDP. This figure was lower than that for Japan (8. 6 percent) and slightly higher than that for the USA Thus, foreign trade plays approximately the same role in all the regions of the triad. 75 percent of Austria's intra-EU imports originate in those seven EU countries which are considered likely candidates for the EMU. In both France and Germany, this figure is only 55 percent. These two countries, therefore, have the utmost interest in maintaining strict exchange rate discipline in the envisaged "EMS II". Austria is mainly concerned with Italy's participation in the EMU, because in that case the share of EU trade not jeopardized by exchange rate fluctuations would rise above 90 percent. The importance of the developing countries as a market for EU exports rose substantially during the early 1990 s. Sales to the non-OPEC countries advanced very rapidly, while OPEC's share in exports declined. 17. 7 percent of total extra-EU exports or almost half of the exports to the developing countries go to the Far East; the corresponding figures are 7. 5 percent for the Middle East, 8. 1 percent for Africa, and 5. 7 percent for Latin America. In Austria, 22 percent of extra-EU exports were destined for the developing countries; Austria also had a relatively strong position in the OPEC (6 percent). Manufactured products dominate foreign trade of the EU: this group accounts for 84. 1 percent of total exports, and 78. 8 percent of total imports, with machinery and transport equipment constituting the most important items. The share of <b>semi-manufactures</b> (mostly low-grade goods used in manufacturing) in exports is substantially smaller in the EU (18. 2 percent) than in Austria (28. 9 percent); steel accounted for only 3. 5 percent of total EU exports (Austria 5. 3 percent); the figures for textiles are 3. 1 percent (4. 1 percent). As far as intermediary products are concerned, agricultural products with a share of 10 percent are the most important export items. Außenhandel der EU.
