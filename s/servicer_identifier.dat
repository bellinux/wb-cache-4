40|$|Abstract The {{assumption}} {{of the availability of}} port information at design time of service compositions in Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) is not valid for an increasing number of hosts on the Internet that do not have a public, static IP address. Existing workflow engines do not support services deployed on such hosts, as service invocations require the availability of port information defined either in concrete WSDL definitions or within a deployment descriptor of the BPEL workflow engine. This paper presents a workflow engine that supports runtime look-up of service endpoints based on a P 2 P middleware. Using a <b>service</b> <b>identifier</b> based on a DHT <b>identifier,</b> <b>Service</b> Proxy objects that encapsulate port information are downloaded over the structured P 2 P network from the host where the service is deployed. A Service Proxy delegates service invocations to an abstract protocol adaptor framework that uses dynamic invocation mechanisms to provide a protocol-independent execution of remote services, e. g., over GIOP/IIOP or SOAP. This allows us to specify binding- and port-agnostic service compositions in BPEL using abstract WSDL and our <b>service</b> <b>identifiers.</b> To validate our approach, we extended the ActiveBPEL workflow engine to support the discovery protocol adaptor. ...|$|R

40|$|Currently the Internet {{has only}} one level of name resolution, DNS, which {{converts}} user-level domain names into IP addresses. In this paper we borrow liberally from the literature to argue {{that there should be}} three levels of name resolution: from user-level descriptors to service identifiers; from <b>service</b> <b>identifiers</b> to endpoint identifiers; and from endpoint identifiers to IP addresses. These additional levels of naming and resolution (1) allow services and data to be first class Internet objects (in that they can be directly and persistently named), (2) seamlessly accommodate mobility and multihoming and (3) integrate middleboxes (such as NATs and firewalls) into the Internet architecture. We further argue that flat names are a natural choice for the <b>service</b> and endpoint <b>identifiers.</b> Hence, this architecture requires scalable resolution of flat names, a capability that distributed hash tables (DHTs) can provide...|$|R

The former designation for the service was the number 1, itself introduced in 1924, a designation shared by all Brighton Line mainline services. The letter designations did not appear on earlier equipment that carried the former route numbers. Therefore, older equipment that carried the number 1 (notably the D-type Triplex) continued to be signed 1 until they were withdrawn from service in 1965.|$|R

50|$|Just as HTTP is a {{stateless}} protocol, so is SMS. As SMS became interoperable across rival {{networks in}} 1999, and text messaging started its ascent towards becoming a ubiquitous global form of communication, various enterprises {{became interested in}} using the SMS channel for commercial purposes. Initial services did not require session management since they were only one-way communications (for example, in 2000, the first mobile news service was delivered via SMS in Finland). Today, these applications {{are referred to as}} application-to-peer (A2P) messaging as distinct from peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging. The development of interactive enterprise applications required session management, but because SMS is a stateless protocol as defined by the GSM standards, early implementations were controlled client-side by having the end-users enter commands and <b>service</b> <b>identifiers</b> manually.|$|R

An inefficient service version management with arbitrary decisions could lead to disconnections between service consumers and service providers.

The goal of this thesis is to specify, design and implement a service evolution management system for a multi-tenant aware ESB solution, so that the ESB could have the capabilities to manage the changes of multiple service versions between service consumers and service providers in a transparent manner. Furthermore, a function should be provided to check the compatibility between service versions, and, moreover, the calculation of <b>service</b> <b>identifiers</b> should be executed automatically, because service descriptions do not contain version-related information...|$|R
