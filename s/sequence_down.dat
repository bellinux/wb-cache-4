It {{was evident that}} Berks meant to finish the battle off-hand, whilst Jim, {{with two of the}} most {{experienced}} men in England to advise him, was quite aware that his correct tactics were to allow the ruffian to expend his strength and wind in vain. There was something horrible in the ferocious energy of Berks's hitting, every blow fetching a grunt from him as he smashed it in, and after each I gazed at Jim, as I have gazed at a stranded vessel upon the Sussex beach when wave after wave has roared over it, fearing each time that I should find it miserably mangled. But still the lamplight shone upon the lad's clear, alert face, upon his well- opened eyes and his firm-set mouth, while the blows were taken upon his forearm or allowed, by a quick duck of the head, to whistle over his shoulder. But Berks was artful as well as violent. Gradually he worked Jim back into an angle of the ropes from which there was no escape, and then, when he had him fairly penned, he sprang upon him like a tiger. What happened was so quick that I cannot set its <b>sequence</b> <b>down</b> in words, but I saw Jim make a quick stoop under the swinging arms, and at the same instant I heard a sharp, ringing smack, and there was Jim dancing about {{in the middle of the}} ring, and Berks lying upon his side on the floor, with his hand to his eye.|$|E

40|$|For {{applications}} such as videophone or videoconferencing, {{we all agree that}} foreground object {{is more important than the}} background information. Nevertheless, in most conventional video codecs, such as H. 261, due to the variation of the background lighting, noise or other unpredictable reasons, a large amount of available bandwidth is used to code the residue blocks at the background. Thus, it makes the coding inefficient when we consider the subjective visual quality of the foreground object. In this paper we proposed an object-based coding method. It tries to identify the foreground object and then put most of the resources to code it. We suggest a block-based DWT as a coding kernel because of its simple structure and outstanding performance. Experimental results show that we can compress a video <b>sequence</b> <b>down</b> to below 20 kb/s while having a reasonable visual quality...|$|E

Hence LHS 1070 is a valuable object to understand the onset of dust formation in cool stellar atmospheres. This work aims at determining the fundamental stellar parameters of LHS 1070 and to test recent model atmospheres: BT-Dusty,BT-Settl, DRIFT, and MARCS models.

40|$|Recent wide-field {{near-infrared}} {{surveys have}} uncovered {{a large number}} of cool brown dwarfs, extending the temperature <b>sequence</b> <b>down</b> to less than 500 K and constraining the faint end of the luminosity function. One interesting implication of the derived luminosity function is that the brown dwarf census in the immediate (< 10 pc) solar neighborhood is still largely incomplete, and some bright (J< 16) brown dwarfs remain to be identified in existing surveys. These objects are especially interesting as they are the ones that can be studied in most detail, especially with techniques that require large fluxes (e. g. time-variability, polarimetry, high-resolution spectroscopy) that cannot realistically be applied to objects uncovered by deep surveys. By cross-matching the DENIS and the 2 MASS point-source catalogs, we have identified an overlooked brown dwarf -DENIS J 081730. 0 - 615520 - that is the brightest field mid-T dwarf in the sky (J = 13. 6).
