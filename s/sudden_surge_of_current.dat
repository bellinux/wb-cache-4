5000|$|The {{electrodes}} of {{the lamp}} are usually {{connected to a}} capacitor, which is charged to a relatively high voltage (generally between 250 and 5000 volts), using a step up transformer and a rectifier. The gas, however, exhibits extremely high resistance, and the lamp will not conduct electricity until the gas is ionized. Once ionized, or [...] "triggered", a spark will form between the electrodes, allowing the capacitor to discharge. The <b>sudden</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> electric <b>current</b> quickly heats the gas to a plasma state, where electrical resistance becomes very low. There are several methods of triggering.|$|R

50|$|One {{explanation}} for the effect is a cold-induced malfunction of the hypothalamus, {{the part of the}} brain that regulates body temperature.

By designing an OMA under which its deadweight loss is appropriately distributed to them, they avoid the retaliation approved by GATT which causes an additional deadweight loss.
