25|$|According to the Constitution of the Athenians, Solon legislated for all {{citizens}} to be admitted into the Ekklesia and for a court (the Heliaia) to be formed from all the citizens. The Heliaia {{appears to have been}} the Ekklesia, or <b>some</b> <b>representative</b> portion of it, sitting as a jury. By giving common people the power not only to elect officials but also to call them to account, Solon appears to have established the foundations of a true republic. However some scholars have doubted whether Solon actually included the Thetes in the Ekklesia, this being considered too bold a move for any aristocrat in the archaic period. Ancient sources credit Solon with the creation of a Council of Four Hundred, drawn from the four Athenian tribes to serve as a steering committee for the enlarged Ekklesia. However, many modern scholars have doubted this also.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>representative</b> {{examples}} of the Anatolian beyliks' architecture are İlyas Bey Mosque at Balat (Milet) (1404), İsabey Mosque at Selçuk (1375), Ulucami Mosque at Birgi (1312) built by the Aydın beylik. The above mosques, although being successors of Seljuq architecture, differ greatly in the increase of decorations in the interior and exterior spaces and the different placement of the courtyards and minarets. Karaman beylik also left noteworthy architectural works, such as Ulucami Mosque in Ermenek (1302), Hatuniye Madrassa in Karaman (1382), Akmedrese Madrassa in Niğde (1409), all of which respect a new style that considers and incorporates the exterior surroundings also. One of the first {{examples of}} the Anatolian beylik architecture hinting at the forming of the Ottoman architecture that aims at uniting the interior space beneath one big dome and forming a monumental architectural structure is Ulucami Mosque in Manisa (1374) built by the Saruhan beylik. Also worth noting is the increase in constructions of madrassas that points at the beyliks' attaching greater importance to sciences.|$|E

500|$|At {{the heart}} of New Age Politics is a {{critique}} of the consciousness we all supposedly share, a [...] "six-sided prison" [...] that has kept us all trapped for hundreds of years. [...] The six sides of the [...] "prison" [...] are said to be: patriarchal attitudes, egocentricity, scientific single vision, the bureaucratic mentality, nationalism (xenophobia), and the [...] "big city outlook" [...] (fear of nature). [...] Since consciousness, according to Satin, ultimately determines our institutions, prison consciousness is said to be ultimately responsible for [...] "monolithic" [...] institutions that offer us {{little in the way of}} freedom of choice or connection with others. [...] <b>Some</b> <b>representative</b> monolithic institutions are: bureaucratic government, automobile-centered transportation systems, attorney-centered law, doctor-centered health care, and church-centered spirituality.|$|E
500|$|Late Bronze Age Greece {{was divided}} {{into a series of}} warrior kingdoms, the most {{important}} being centered in Mycenae, to which the culture of this era owes its name, Tiryns, Pylos and Thebes. From the 15th century BC, Mycenaean power began expanding towards the Aegean, the Anatolian coast and Cyprus. Mycenaean armies shared several common features with other contemporary Late Bronze Age powers: they were initially based on heavy infantry, with spears, large shields and in some occasions armor. In the 13th century BC, Mycenaean units underwent a transformation in tactics and weaponry and became more uniform and flexible and their weapons became smaller and lighter. <b>Some</b> <b>representative</b> types of Mycenaean armor/weapons were the boar's tusk helmet and the [...] "Figure-of-eight" [...] shield. Moreover, most features of the later hoplite panoply of Classical Greece were already known at this time.|$|E

500|$|To {{explain how}} to break free of the prison and its institutions, Satin {{develops}} a [...] "psychocultural" [...] class analysis that reveals the existence of [...] "life-", [...] "thing-", and [...] "death-oriented" [...] classes. [...] According to Satin, life-oriented individuals constitute an emerging [...] "third force" [...] in post-industrial nations. [...] The third force is generating a [...] "prison-free" [...] consciousness consisting of androgynous attitudes, spirituality, multiple perspectives, a cooperative mentality, local-and-global identities, and an ecological outlook. [...] To transform prison society, Satin argues, the third force {{is going to have}} to launch an [...] "evolutionary movement" [...] to replace– or at least supplement– monolithic institutions with life-affirming, [...] "biolithic" [...] ones. [...] <b>Some</b> <b>representative</b> biolithic institutions are: deliberative democracy as an alternative to bureaucratic government, bicycles and mass transit as an alternative to the private automobile, and mediation as an alternative to attorney-centered law. [...] According to Satin, the third force will not have to overthrow capitalism, since Western civilization– not capitalism– is said to be responsible for the prison. [...] But the third force will want to foster a prison-free New Age capitalism through intelligent regulation and elimination of all subsidies.|$|E
