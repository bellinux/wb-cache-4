60|$|I do not {{suppose there}} is any magical thing in any fairyland to compare with the Record Book, {{on the pages of}} which are {{constantly}} being printed a record of every event that happens in any part of the world, at exactly the moment it happens.

And when they are so, it will not breed any confusion or mistake about them, though the senses should (as <b>sometimes</b> <b>they</b> <b>do)</b> convey them from the same object differently on different occasions, and so seem to err. For, though {{a man in a}} fever should from sugar have a bitter taste, which at another time would produce a sweet one, yet the idea of bitter in that man's mind would be as clear and distinct from the idea of sweet as if he had tasted only gall. Nor does it make any more confusion between the two ideas of sweet and bitter that the same sort of body produces at one time one, and at another time another idea by the taste, than it makes a confusion in two ideas of white and sweet, or white and round, that the same piece of sugar produces them both in the mind at the same time. And the ideas of orange-colour and azure, that are produced in the mind by the same parcel of the infusion of lignum nephritmim, are no less distinct ideas than those of the same colours taken from two very different bodies.|$|E
