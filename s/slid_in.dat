5|$|In {{the top of}} {{the eighth}} inning, with one out and two men on base, Red Sox closer Foulke came in to pitch. Édgar Rentería singled towards Ramírez in left field, who unintentionally kicked the ball away, {{allowing}} Jason Marquis to score. Walker also hit the ball towards Ramírez in the next at bat. Ramírez <b>slid</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to try to catch the ball, but tripped and deflected the ball for his second error in two plays, and the fourth Red Sox error in the game. Roger Cedeño scored on the play to tie the game at nine. In the bottom of the eighth inning, however, Jason Varitek reached on an error, and Bellhorn then hit a home run off the right field foul pole, also known as Pesky's Pole, for his third home run in as many games to give the Red Sox a two-run lead. In the ninth inning, Foulke struck out Cedeño to win the game for the Red Sox 11–9.|$|E

25|$|The Contemporary Tower, {{the most}} {{prominent}} of the resort's four stand-alone buildings, was built as an A-frame with outer walls which slope inwards around an inner atrium. This design was a collaboration by Disney, the United States Steel Corporation, and Los Angeles architect Welton Becket. To construct the building, steel frames were erected on-site and modular pre-constructed rooms, designed by California architect Donald Wexler, were lifted into place by crane. Most of Disney's Polynesian Village Resort and the Court of Flags Resort were built the same way, except rooms were stacked instead of <b>slid</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
25|$|Moreover, Green Party leader John Gormley {{publicly}} {{stated that}} trust between the coalition parties had been greatly eroded, perhaps irreparably. At that point, members of Fianna Fáil, including {{many of those}} who had previously announced support for Cowen in the party's confidence motion, began questioning his leadership and pressing for his resignation from leadership before the election. The press, meanwhile, compared the attempted reshuffle and its fallout to the GUBU political disaster of the early 1980s Charles Haughey government, up to that point the most sensational political scandal {{in the history of the}} Republic. Fianna Fáil, already at a record low 14% approval rating, <b>slid</b> <b>in</b> the wake of the botched reshuffle to 8%.|$|E
25|$|In this game, Tim Tebow {{also created}} an iconic image {{of himself and}} the Gators for 2008. Because of the rainy {{conditions}} in Tallahassee that day, the field was extremely wet and slippery, affecting play on both sides. On a 4-yard TD run into the endzone, Tebow <b>slid</b> <b>in</b> on the wet turf, causing {{the front of his}} white Away jersey to get wet red paint on it. The paint also got on his face and helmet and stayed on {{for the majority of the}} game. The red paint resembled blood to many people which provided Tebow with a bravado of bravery and passion, which also highlighted his intense sideline celebrations and enthusiasm. The image of Tebow's paint-stained Jersey became one of the lasting and memorable images in sports for 2008 and for the decade at large.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, the Parrot has {{accompanied}} the Pirates on road trips if {{the game is}} within close proximity to Pittsburgh. For instance, the Parrot appeared at two games for the Pirates during a weekend interleague series against the Cleveland Indians in Cleveland in 2012, with the Parrot having friendly interactions with the Indians mascot, Slider, and even assisting <b>Slider</b> <b>in</b> interfering with the Indians Hot Dog Race, much like what the Parrot does with the Great Pierogi Race.|$|R
25|$|Button {{qualified}} in seventh, {{but took}} a five-place grid penalty {{for changing the}} gearbox in his McLaren. As a result his teammate Magnussen moved into seventh. Despite improving his car's balance, Räikkönen slid several times after a front-end problem could not be rectified, creating understeer, and was restricted to starting eighth. Sutil took ninth and Maldonado, who was the fastest driver not to advance into the final part of qualifying, rounded out the top ten, but <b>slid</b> <b>in</b> turn 19, losing about two-tenths of a second, preventing him from bettering his time. Pérez used two set of super-soft tyres in the first session to ensure he made {{the second part of}} qualifying and took 11th. Hülkenberg was forecast to qualify in the top ten until a tear-off visor wrapped itself around one of his front tyres entering turn 12. He had no grip, ran wide, and lost time, restricting him to qualifying 13th. Kvyat complained of tyre temperature issues after being delayed by slower traffic on his out-lap and could only muster 14th. However, he was handed a ten-place grid penalty for changing an engine component. His teammate Vergne moved into his former starting position and was the fastest driver not to enter the second session by five hundredths of a seconds. Vergne attributed this to changing to an old less powerful engine and excessive oversteer. Esteban Gutiérrez lined up in 15th ahead of Grosjean. Vettel opted to do one lap on soft compound tyres to comply with the 107% rule and took 17th. He started from the pit lane after changing his engine, his sixth of the season.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-seventeenth century, {{what was}} known as a hunter's horn {{underwent}} transformation into an [...] "art instrument" [...] consisting of a lengthened tube, a narrower bore, a wider bell, and much wider range. The details of this transformation are unclear, but the modern horn or, more colloquially, French horn, had emerged by 1725. The slide trumpet appeared, a variation that includes a long-throated mouthpiece that <b>slid</b> <b>in</b> and out, allowing the player infinite adjustments in pitch. This variation on the trumpet was unpopular due to the difficulty involved in playing it. Organs underwent tonal changes in the Baroque period, as manufacturers such as Abraham Jordan of London made the stops more expressive and added devices such as expressive pedals. Sachs viewed this trend as a [...] "degeneration" [...] of the general organ sound.|$|E
500|$|The gradual {{accumulation}} of {{ice on the}} Laurentide ice sheet led to a gradual increase in its mass, as the [...] "binge phase". Once the sheet reached a critical mass, the soft, unconsolidated sub-glacial sediment formed a [...] "slippery lubricant" [...] over which the ice sheet <b>slid,</b> <b>in</b> the [...] "purge phase", lasting around 750 years. The original model (MacAyeal, 1993) proposed that geothermal heat caused the sub-glacial sediment to thaw once the ice volume was large enough to prevent the escape of heat into the atmosphere. The mathematics of the system are consistent with a 7,000-year periodicity, similar to that observed if H3 and H6 are indeed Heinrich events (Sarnthein et al. 2001). However, if H3 and H6 are not Heinrich events, the Binge-Purge model loses credibility, as the predicted periodicity is key to its assumptions.|$|E

Cavendish moved up the order, behind two other riders – 's Daryl Impey and [...] rider Óscar Freire – and <b>slid</b> <b>in</b> behind Greipel with around [...] to go. Cavendish launched his sprint off Greipel's wheel with [...] left, and got the better of him by half a wheel to take his 21st Tour stage victory, moving out of a tie with Luxembourg's Nicolas Frantz for sixth place on the all-time Tour stage wins list. Greipel, Goss, Veelers and 's Alessandro Petacchi completed the top five on the stage, with Sagan taking the points classification lead, and the green jersey, from 's Fabian Cancellara with sixth place. Cancellara maintained his seven-second overall lead over Cavendish's teammate Bradley Wiggins.|$|E
500|$|Friday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} 90 minutes. The cars went out {{one at a}} time in the reverse order of the fastest combined practice laps. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. The session took place in dry and sunny weather conditions. Bräck recorded the track speed record at Rockingham Motor Speedway and secured his first pole position of the season, the seventh of his CART career, as well as his second at the circuit, with a time of 24.908 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Michael Andretti who set a lap time two-hundredths of a second slower than Bräck. Da Matta qualified third. He had removed his foot from the accelerator pedal when driving through the fourth turn and felt he could have started from first place. Takagi took fourth, and Franchitti started fifth after steering right to the track's outside on his second lap due to oversteer and reduced his speed preventing him from setting a faster time. Junqueira's car was set up with a large amount of downforce which restricted him to sixth, and Paul Tracy secured seventh because his car <b>slid</b> <b>in</b> the third and fourth turns. Tony Kanaan qualified in eighth and was satisfied with his lap which was recorded in a back-up car.|$|E

2500|$|P.G.L. Dirichlet {{published}} his works in both French and German. The strict original meaning {{of either the}} German , or the French , corresponds to the English , an open-topped box that can be <b>slid</b> <b>in</b> {{and out of the}} cabinet that contains it. These terms were morphed to the word , standing for a small open space in a desk, cabinet, or wall for keeping letters or papers, metaphorically rooted in the structures that house pigeons. Considering the fact that Dirichlet's father was a postmaster, necessarily best acquainted to furniture of type pigeonhole, common for sorting letters in his business, the translation by pigeonholes may be a perfect transfer of Dirichlet's terms of understanding. The meaning, referring to some furniture features, has since been strongly overtaken and is fading, especially among those who do not speak English natively, but as a lingua franca in the scientific world, in favour of the more pictorial interpretation, literally involving pigeons and holes. It {{is interesting to note that}} the suggestive, though not misleading interpretation of [...] "pigeonhole" [...] as [...] "dovecote" [...] has lately found its way back to a German [...] "re-translation" [...] of the [...] "pigeonhole"-principle as the [...] "Taubenschlag"-principle.|$|E
2500|$|On lap 124, {{the race}} for the {{beneficiary}} resulted in the [...] "Big One". This began when Earnhardt, Jr. spun Brian Vickers into traffic {{toward the end of the}} backstretch, collecting race dominator Busch and his brother Kurt, Robby Gordon, Jamie McMurray, Carl Edwards, Denny Hamlin, Scott Speed, and Earnhardt, Jr.'s teammate Jimmie Johnson. R. Gordon's car <b>slid</b> <b>in</b> front of Earnhardt, Jr. within a couple of feet of contact. Many of Earnhardt Jr.'s fans, the Daytona 500 participants, and the drivers believed that the contact was done intentionally; and many fans (including those of the #88 fans) and drivers (such as Vickers, Ku. and Ky. Busch, R. Gordon, Hamlin, and McMurray gave NASCAR requests and calls to black-flag Earnhardt, Jr. [...] Earnhardt was penalized on two counts by NASCAR; [...] first, he was sent to the tail end of the longest line for overasggressive driving, and the ensuing penalty meant he was not granted the beneficiary as a result. [...] (A driver cannot cause the caution in order to be granted the beneficiary.) [...] Brian Vickers was angry and said when interviewed [...] "To wreck somebody intentionally like that in front of the entire field is really kind of dangerous. That's my biggest problem with it. But, apparently, (Earnhardt, Jr.) wanted a caution pretty bad." [...] Both Vickers and Earnhardt, Jr. were a lap down before the wreck occurred, and Earnhardt, Jr. was unaware that he was battling Vickers for the position. [...] At this time, Kevin Harvick pushed Matt Kenseth into a battle for first between Kenseth and Sadler. On lap 138, Jeff Burton smacked the wall, collecting Paul Menard. Burton was then black-flagged for having a piece of sheetmetal hanging from his bumper.|$|E
