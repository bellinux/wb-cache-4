40|$|International audienceToday, {{there is}} no consensus, either in {{engineering}} sciences or in ergonomics, on {{the best way of}} introducing ergonomics–taking into consideration the human operator–into the design cycle of human–machine systems. Several authors agree in saying that the analysis and the design of complex, modern systems require an update of the methodological tools in relation to: the notions of “system” and “complexity”; and the effects of automation on the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>installations</b> by the human operator. This chapter supports this notion. After presenting classic design approaches, the chapter looks at two methods that seek to integrate the different components of the system during design: the method by Long, Dowell and Timmer, which aims to define the performance criteria of the system that could orient the design choices, and the method developed by Rasmussen, then by Rasmussen, Pejtersen and Goodstein and by Vicente in a didactical form...|$|E

One of the factor that supporting confidence is room chief. Room chief as first manager and front line that have responsibility to the nursing process activity and facilitating nursing so that can execute nursing practice according to standard. But there’s any breakdown of the room chief duty that cannot execute yet so the room chief performance not like expected yet. This research was execute in 22 inpatient chief sample in Dr. Kariadi Hospital Semarang. The purpose {{of this research is}} to know factors that related with chief performance in Dr. Kariadi Hospital Semarang. This research is use questionaire and analyzing data with Fisher Extract test and Analysis Corelasy Product Moment Pearsent.

40|$|Building {{information}} modelling {{has proven to}} be an effective tool for both engineering and construction management. It can be used from early conceptual design to detailed design and for creating construction phase models. It is also a practical tool for managing communication and other data between Designers, Constructor, Fabricators and Contractors. This Master’s thesis is a company specific case study and written for localizing potential in more BIM based project management. Main objective of the research is to formulate a sketch of a suitable BIM based installation logistics and project management system focusing on packing management system and packing order. The research has been delimited to pertain steel frame elements of power plant engine hall. In order to achieve the main objective, installation logistics and other construction management related properties of the chosen softwares Tekla Structures and Tekla BIMsight are examined. Main interests of the constructor company concerning construction management and especially installation logistics are also localized. Furthermore, quality standards for modelling and packing process are defined to achieve the main objective. As a result, findings of the research and suggested tools are evaluated based on the needs of the constructor. Tekla Stuctures can be used for conceptual design, for generating drawings and report, and for erection scheduling. In addition, it {{has turned out to be}} practical software for managing frame element delivery and data needed for site management. Organizer found in Tekla Structures especially is a handy tool for managing information needed for coordination of a site and frame element delivery. Tekla BIMsight is software for project collaboration and can be used for combining the models of different project stakeholders and for frame element unloading and installation management. Tekla BIMsight is a practical tool for making assembly plans and progress reports <b>of</b> site <b>installation</b> works. It can also be used for the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> works, for frame element unloading and grouping, and for on-site collaboration between structural and MEP works. Use of note files compatible to Tekla Structures and Tekla BIMsight enables BIM based communication between Structural Designers, Project Engineers and Site Supervisors throughout the project. The best way to ensure a practical frame element packing order is to attach an installation sequence number pointing out the required packing order for each steel assembly and to publish these numbers in an assembly list. It is also practical to divide an engine hall for modules and phases if needed using the Organizer tool in Tekla Structures, and to utilize this division for managing frame element delivery. Still, for developing installation logistics further, it is recommendable to seek better frame installation management through more integrated BIM based communication protocols...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundFrom 1992 to 1999, {{an average}} of more than 18, 000 unintentional home injury deaths {{occurred}} in the U. S. annually. PurposeThe objective {{of this study was}} to provide current prevalence estimates of fatal unintentional injury in the home. MethodsData from the 200022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2008 National Vital Statistics System were used in 2011 to calculate average annual rates for unintentional home injury deaths for the U. S. overall, and by mechanism of injury, gender, and age group. ResultsFrom 2000 to 2008, there was an annual average of 30, 569 unintentional injury deaths occurring in the home environment in the U. S. (10. 3 deaths per 100, 000). Poisonings (4. 5 per 100, 000) and falls (3. 5 per 100, 000) were the leading causes of home injury deaths. Men/boys had higher rates of home injury death than women/girls (12. 7 vs 8. 2 per 100, 000), and older adults (22 ̆ 030580 years) had higher rates than other age groups. Home injury deaths and rates increased significantly from 2000 to 2008. ConclusionsMore than 30, 000 people die annually in the U. S. from unintentional injuries at home, with the trend rising since the year 2000. The overall rise is due in large part to the dramatic increase in deaths due to poisonings, and to a lesser degree falls at home. Unintentional home injuries are both predictable and preventable. Through a multifaceted approach combining behavioral change, adequate <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> children, <b>installation</b> and maintenance <b>of</b> safety devices, and adherence to building codes, safety regulations and legislation, home injuries can be reduced.
