40|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention {{deemed the}} {{increase}} in overdose fatalities, due {{to the use of}} opioids, an “opioid epidemic” in the United States. Heroin, fentanyl, and other synthetic opioids are commonly abused and are contributing to the opioid epidemic. In 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration temporarily placed three fentanyl analogs (beta-hydroxythiofentanyl, butyryl fentanyl, and furanyl fentanyl) under Schedule I due to their imminent threat to public health. These drugs elicit analgesic effects similar to heroin making them desirable drugs to abuse. Novel fentanyl analogs and designer opioids are expected to become more prominent in forensic casework in the near future as the opioid epidemic continues. These drugs can be seen in forensic <b>seized</b> <b>drug</b> and urine casework samples either alone or mixed with other drugs of abuse. It is therefore necessary to have an efficient methodology to identify these new compounds. Currently, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is used to identify drugs of abuse and is considered the “gold standard” in forensic casework. However, analysis times can often range from 15 to 60 minutes in length. Another drawback is the need for spectral library matching, which requires analytical reference materials for identification. Therefore, the identification of novel fentanyl analogs and designer drugs is limited until a reference material becomes available. In this study, direct sample analysis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (DSA-TOFMS) was evaluated to provide rapid identification of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids in <b>seized</b> <b>drug</b> and urine casework samples. DSA is a direct ambient ionization source, which requires no chromatography and minimal sample preparation. TOFMS is a high resolution mass spectrometer that uses collision-induced dissociation (CID) to produce precursor ion and characteristic fragmentation ions, which provide additional structural and molecular formula information, allowing for the identification of compounds without a reference material. The analytes explored in this study include: heroin, 6 -monoacetylmorphine (6 -MAM), morphine, fentanyl, norfentanyl, 4 -anilino-N-phenethylpiperidine (4 -ANPP), acetyl fentanyl, beta-hydroxythiofentanyl, butyryl fentanyl, furanyl fentanyl, valeryl fentanyl, AH- 7921, U- 47700, buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, desomorphine, MT- 45, W- 15, and W- 18. Direct sample analysis time-of flight mass spectrometry (DSA-TOFMS) is a novel instrumentation that could be utilized in the forensic sciences field to qualitatively identify illicit substances in casework samples. In this study, 19 compounds of interest containing heroin, fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and other synthetic opioids were evaluated using DSA-TOFMS. DSA-TOFMS abbreviated the workload of the analysis and was utilized to provide precursor ion and characteristic fragmentation ions within an analysis time of 20 seconds. Certified reference standards were used to optimize instrumentation settings, to determine precursor ions and characteristic fragmentation ions, and to determine the limit of detection of the instrument. A carryover study determined there were no persisting ions present when entering the capillary inlet between runs. A repeatability study revealed the DSA-TOFMS repeated results within the acceptable criteria range of above 500 counts and within 10 ppm error 93 % (10 ppm) and 83 % (1 ppm). Forensic <b>seized</b> <b>drug</b> casework samples were evaluated with DSA-TOFMS and qualitatively identified. Out of the 64 samples, 89 % were qualitatively identified as heroin, 4 % were qualitatively identified as fentanyl, 1 % was qualitatively identified as heroin and fentanyl, 3 % were qualitatively identified as acetyl fentanyl, and 3 % were qualitatively identified as furanyl fentanyl. The casework samples containing furanyl fentanyl were considered “true unknown unknown samples,” as the Maine Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory gas chromatography-mass spectrometry library did not have a spectrum to use for the identification of these samples. Forensic urine casework samples were evaluated with DSA-TOFMS. Samples previously confirmed to contain compounds of interest were prepared using minimal sample preparation technique (filtered using 0. 45 microns syringe filters and diluted (1 : 10) with LC/MS grade water). Analysis displayed the limitations of DSA-TOFMS as only twelve of the forty compounds of interest were present and only three of the twelve were within the acceptable criteria range. DSA-TOFMS is a fast and reliable technique with minimal sample preparation for forensic <b>seized</b> <b>drug</b> samples. However, the concentration in complex matrixes, such as urine and blood, were unable to be qualitatively identified using this sample preparation method by DSA-TOFMS...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} aspect in forensic analysis is drug profiling. Information regarding the chemical properties of <b>seized</b> <b>drug</b> samples can be accumulated, which provides intelligence information to assist law enforcement agencies. Such {{information can be}} used to combat drug trafficking and abuse. In this study, twenty three illicit cannabis samples seized from Selangor and suburbs of Kuala Lumpur which were submitted to the Department of Chemistry Malaysia were analyzed. All cannabis samples were extracted using methanol-chloroform mixture in a ratio of 9 : 1. High performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) technique was used to separate cannabinoids in illicit herbal cannabis samples using Onyx Monolithic column. Mobile phase consisting of methanolwater (75 : 25) was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 0. 8 mL/min and analytes detected at 220 nm. Analysis of reproducibility of retention time and peak area has validated the robustness of silica based monolithic column for HPLC analysis of cannabis. Peak areas of the cannabis extracts were used to profile illicit cannabis samples. Profiling of cannabis samples were established using cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Results from cluster analysis suggest that the illicit cannabis samples could have originated from five different geographical origins. Although PCA produced almost similar groupings like cluster analysis, but is not a suitable tool for analysing small set of data. PCA is more suited to decompose large data set with more variables. Classification model from this work suggests that plant material from one geographical origin can be trafficked by different means of route...|$|E

Physical and chemical properties of a <b>seized</b> <b>drug</b> samples can be accumulated, and provides intelligence information to combat drug trafficking and abuse.

Herbal cannabis samples were extracted using methanol- chloroform mixture in 9 : 1 ratio. HPLC separation employed Onyx Monolithic C 18 column. Mobile phase consisting of methanol-water (75 : 25) was used as eluent at a flow rate of 0. 8 mL/min and analytes detected at 220 nm. Three major cannabinoids: cannabinoid (CBD), cannabinol (CBN) and tetrahydrocannbinol (THC) were separated within twenty five minutes. Peak area of the three cannabinoids obtained from HPLC analysis were then further analyzed using three types of multivariate analyses, which are Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Cluster analysis and Soft Independent Modeling Class Analogy (SIMCA) analysis. All multivariate analyses were performed using Unscrambler X 10. 0. Results from these three multivariate analyses were compared to find which is more suited for profiling of illicit cannabis samples. HPLC profiling produced four groupings among fifty six cannabis extracts, these four groups were further sub-grouped by PCA into fifteen groups. Out of these fifteen groups, four main clusters were observed. Cluster analysis was also performed to confirm findings of PCA; results from Cluster analysis also revealed four clusters among the cannabis extracts. SIMCA was unsuccessful in profiling cannabis compared with PCA and Cluster analysis, since it produced different classes among the cannabis extracts. Hence, illicit cannabis samples were successfully profiled using PCA and cluster analysis to reveal the samples originating from different origins...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Overview is to compile and analyse {{existing}} data sources and available research, to identify gaps in knowledge and to inform future research needs in this important area of drug policy. The study concludes the following: • The total number of drug seizures reported in the annual reports of the Garda Síochána decreased by 17. 2 per cent between 2000 and 2003, {{the most recent year}} for which figures are available. The total number of seizures increased from 5, 603 in 2002 to 6, 377 in 2003. • Cannabis remains the principal drug seized in Ireland, accounting for 58 per cent {{of the total number of}} reported seizures in 2003. Between 2000 and 2003, there was a 20 per cent decrease in the number of cannabis seizures. • Ecstasy is the second most commonly <b>seized</b> <b>drug</b> in Ireland. Following a sharp increase in the number of ecstasy seizures, from 347 in 1997 to 1, 864 in 2000, there was a decrease to 1, 027 seizures in 2002 and then a slight increase to a total of 1, 083 seizures in 2003. This appears to be consistent with the broader EU trend in ecstasy seizures. • Heroin seizures decreased by just under 18 per cent since 2001, down from 802 in 2001 to 660 in 2003. • An upward trend in cocaine seizures in recent years is evident. The number of cocaine seizures increased steadily since 1995, from 42 seizures in 1995 to 566 in 2003, a growth of more than 1, 200 per cent. Since 2000 the quantity of cocaine seized has increased by just less than 500 per cent. A small number of crack cocaine seizures were made in 2003...|$|E
40|$|In this work, an {{automated}} procedure for extracting chemical profiles of illicit drugs from chromatographic-mass spectrometric data is presented {{along with a}} method for comparison of the profiles using Bayesian inference. The described methods aim to ease {{the work of a}} forensic chemist who is tasked with comparing two samples of a drug, such as amphetamine, and delivering an answer to a question of the form 'Are these two samples from the same source?' Additionally, more statistical rigour is introduced to the process of comparison. The chemical profiles consist of the relative amounts of certain impurities present in <b>seized</b> <b>drug</b> samples. In order to obtain such profiles, the amounts of the target compounds must be recovered from chromatographic-mass spectrometric measurements, which amounts to searching the raw signals for peaks corresponding to the targets. The areas of these peaks must then be integrated and normalized by the sum of all target peak areas. The automated impurity profile extraction presented in this thesis works by first filtering the data corresponding to a sample, which includes discarding irrelevant parts of the raw data, estimating and removing signal baseline using the asymmetrical reweighed penalized least squares (arPLS) algorithm, and smoothing the relevant signals using a Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter. The SG filter is also used to estimate signal derivatives. These derivatives are used in the next step to detect signal peaks from which parameters are estimated for an exponential-Gaussian hybrid peak model. The signal is reconstructed using the estimated model peaks and optimal parameters are found by fitting the reconstructed signal to the measurements via non-linear least squares methods. In the last step, impurity profiles are extracted by integrating the areas of the optimized models for target compound peaks. These areas are then normalized by their sum to obtain relative amounts of the substances. In order to separate the peaks from noise, a model for noise dependency on signal level was fitted to replicate measurements of amphetamine quality control samples non-parametrically. This model was used to compute detection limits based on estimated baseline of the signals. Finally, the classical Pearson correlation based comparison method for these impurity profiles was compared to two Bayesian methods, the Bayes factor (BF) and the predictive agreement(PA). The Bayesian methods used a probabilistic model assuming normally distributed values with normal-gamma prior distribution for the mean and precision parameters. These methods were compared using simulation tests and application to 90 samples of seized amphetamine...|$|E

30|$|Both {{natural and}} {{synthetic}} cannabinoids {{were the most}} frequently used illicit drugs (19.5 % of respondents and all illicit drug users). This agrees with local and international studies as cannabis continues to be the most <b>seized</b> <b>drug</b> worldwide and locally, both {{in terms of the number}} of cases and actual quantities intercepted (CDC 2013; Damiri et al. 2018 a; Damiri et al. 2018 b; UNODC 2015). An average of 5.0 % of students aged 13 – 15  years in the West Bank and 3.6 % in Gaza in 2010 had used marijuana one or more times during their life (CDC 2013). Methamphetamine has become more potent in recent years as techniques for its manufacture have evolved (Damiri et al. 2018 b). A new liquid homemade form of this drug called GG had been introduced to the West Bank in 2013 (Damiri et al. 2018 b). In this study, 87.0 % of illicit drug users had used amphetamines and methamphetamine. Moreover, 43.7 % of illicit drug users use drugs daily. Among the factors acting in favor of the use of cannabis, synthetic cannabinoids, and methamphetamine by these students are the lower price as they are counterfeited drugs and the availability and accessibility of these drugs in children communities. Emerging evidence suggests that heavy cannabis use by adolescents increases the risk of depression and schizophrenia in later life, especially in individuals who already have a vulnerability to develop a psychiatric syndrome (Chadwick et al. 2013; Radhakrishnan et al. 2014). It is associated also with increased rates of arrangement of adjustment problems in adolescence and young adulthood such as other illicit drug use, crime, and suicidal behaviors (Fergusson et al. 2002). Around 35.2 % of users in this study tried to commit suicide, and 35.2 % have given medication. Amphetamines have serious short and long-term harms such as brain damage, producing deficits in learning and memory, permanent damage to the blood vessels of the heart and brain leading to heart attacks, strokes and death, multiple organ damage, severe tooth decay, and psychosis (Wu et al. 2007). Moreover, 2.2 % of students in this study had used opioids or cocaine. This seems to be a high prevalence especially for this age and in the West Bank. Opioids and cocaine were less captured and used in the West Bank especially in the north of the West Bank (Damiri et al. 2018 b). The reported forms were pills such as codeine (Codavis or Rekod) which can be easily accessed from the market or in the form of powder under the names of morphine, heroin, or cocaine. Further investigation was done for the powder, and the results of the tested powder samples indicated that no opioids or cocaine in the tested samples. Substandard and counterfeited illicit drugs are well known and documented in the West Bank (Damiri et al. 2018 b). The tries to commit suicide and the need for hospital admission and medication or treatment center indicate that illicit drug use is a serious problem among Palestinian children, and this calls an urgent need for treatment and rehabilitation centers.|$|E
40|$|A common {{practice}} amongst street drug manufacturers and dealers is {{to combine the}} illicit drug of abuse they intend to distribute with additional substances. Substances added {{in an attempt to}} mimic or enhance the desired effect of the drug of abuse are known as adulterants as opposed to diluents, which are added simply to increase the weight of the product. By definition, an adulterant has a physiological effect on the body and as physiologically active compounds these adulterants may have side effects apart from the drug it is added to. They can be minimal, treatable, or otherwise manageable while others can be worse than those incurred from the drug of abuse itself. Due to varying trends in street drug purity, an effort must be made to understand the effects adulterants and diluents, as well as mixtures thereof, may have on forensic drug analysis. Colorimetric spot test analysis is typically performed using a representative sample of the raw, suspected drug material. These tests are often employed in the lab prior to any attempt to isolate a specific compound or at the scene before an arrest is made. This being the case, the reagents will be exposed to and have the potential to react with anything present in the sample with the drug of abuse. While much work has been done regarding the specificity and cross reactivity of colorimetric spot tests, limited information is available about how mixtures of adulterants may affect the results. This research consists of two parts which approach the common theme of adulterants differently. The first part is a literature based investigation into the pathological side effects of several common drug adulterants. The specific compounds discussed are: levamisole, phenacetin, atropine, and several topical anesthetics (benzocaine, lidocaine, prilocaine, and procaine). A review of articles from the scientific literature was conducted in order to convey what is known in the medical field regarding the effects these compounds can have on the body. The second part of this research was a laboratory based investigation which analyzed the effects of twenty-three common adulterants on two colorimetric spot tests: the Marquis reagent for the presumptive identification of heroin, morphine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, and 3, 4 -methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine (MDMA) and the modified Scott test for the presumptive identification of cocaine. This was performed in order to observe the reactivity of these compounds so that {{a better understanding of the}} effect their presence can have on the analysis of <b>seized</b> <b>drug</b> samples using these tests could be obtained. The literature review portion of this research revealed that the adulterants levamisole, atropine, phenacetin, and the topical anesthetic adulterants lidocaine, prilocaine, benzocaine, and procaine, can be toxic and have severe, deleterious effects on the body in both chronic and acute exposures. Levamisole stimulates the immune system resulting in the production of self-reactive antibodies that attack neutrophils. This causes an autoimmune disorder that weakens the immune system and causes leukocyte agglutination leading to necrotizing vasculitis. Atropine functions to decrease the parasympathetic tone and increase the sympathetic tone in the body. An overdose can cause anticholinergic toxicity, a syndrome very similar to sympathomimetic toxidrome caused by cocaine overdose. Both are characterized by hypertension, hyperthermia, tachycardia, ataxia, disorientation, and mydriasis. However, they can be distinguished as anticholinergic toxicity causes dry and flush skin and mydriasis which is unreactive to light while sympathomimetic toxidrome causes profuse sweating and mydriasis which is reactive to light. Phenacetin is metabolized to O-ethyl-N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (O-Et-NAPQI), a highly reactive and unstable electrophile. It is capable of covalently binding with proteins and other cellular components, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). This leads to mutagenesis and subsequent tumor generation as well as apoptosis and necrosis of various tissues in the bladder and kidneys. The topical anesthetics have each been associated with the development of methemoglobinemia. This is a condition caused by an increase in the concentration of methemoglobin in the blood. Methemoglobin binds more strongly to oxygen so that it cannot be released to the tissues resulting in oxygen starvation. This was found to be caused by the metabolism of prilocaine and lidocaine to the oxidative compounds O-toluidine and 2, 6 -xylidine respectively. The cause has not been previously reported for benzocaine or procaine. The laboratory portion of this research revealed the impact several adulterants and their mixtures can have on colorimetric spot tests. Testing with approximately 1 mg of sample material revealed that eight out of the twenty-three adulterants reacted with the Marquis reagent to cause a color change within 15 minutes. Of the ten 3 -component mixtures tested, eight resulted in a color change. Of the six five-component mixtures, four resulted in a color change; of the six eight-component mixtures, three resulted in a color change; and of the six ten-component mixtures, five resulted in a color change. Of the color changes observed, none were consistent with the "expected" color change for a presumptively positive result of the Marquis test. Testing with the adulterant diphenhydramine revealed that this compound had a unique and intense reaction with the Marquis reagent. This compound initially reacted by turning the liquid a vibrant yellow-green upon contact with the sample. Prior to 2 minutes, solid red-brown aggregates formed in the liquid and proceeded to increase in size while the reagent solution darkened to a red-black color over the 15 minutes of observation. Mixtures containing diphenhydramine each reacted differently. Solid material did not form in the mixture tests and the color changes observed ranged from light orange to a dark red-orange. In addition, one 3 -component mixture containing adulterants which did not cause a color change when tested individually (diltiazem, acetaminophen, and quinine) was observed to cause a light brown color to develop, which darkened over the 15 minutes of observation. The results for the modified Scott test showed that the complexity of this test has made it highly specific for cocaine. None of the individual components or mixtures tested reacted in a manner consistent with a presumptively positive identification for cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) or cocaine base for all three steps. Of the twenty-three adulterants tested, eight of the twenty-three gave a similar result to cocaine base in step 1, however, of these eight, only one (quinine) gave a similar result to cocaine base in step 2, and this adulterant did not react consistently to cocaine base in step 3. The research using the adulterant mixtures revealed that the compounds present in these samples tended to react individually with the modified Scott test reagents. In other words, the results for each mixture appeared as a combination of the individual results for each component. While the results observed for the adulterants and mixtures tested were not consistent with the expected presumptively positive results for the drugs these tests are used to detect, it was concluded that the presence of adulterants in a sample has the potential to affect the results of a colorimetric spot test in a variety of ways. Given that these tests are typically employed on samples of raw suspected drug material, it is important that analysts understand the impact adulterants can have on the interpretation of presumptive drug tests...|$|E

The types of exhibits analyzed using diode array UV detection include phe-nethylamines, cocaine, oxycodone, heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), opium, hallucinogenic mushrooms, and g-hydroxybutyrate-g-butyrolactone (GHB-GBL). Both qualitative and quantitative analyses are achieved using run buffers that contain addi-tives that provide for secondary equilibrium and/or dynamic coating of the capillary. Dynamic coating of the capillary surface is accomplished by rapid flushes of 0. 1 N sodium hydroxide, water, buffer containing polycation coating reagent, and a buffer containing a polyanionic coating reagent (with or without cyclodextrin(s)) or a micelle coating reagent. Dynamic coating with a polyanionic coating reagent is used for the analysis of moderately basic <b>seized</b> <b>drugs</b> and adulterants. The use of cyclodextrin in the run buffer not only allows for chiral analysis but also greatly enhances separation selectivity for achiral solutes. A capillary dynamically coated with a micelle allows for the analysis of neutral, acidic, and weakly basic drugs (GHB, GBL and neutral, acidic, and weakly basic adulterants). Dynamic coating, which gives rise to a relatively high and robust electroosmotic flow at pH, 7, allows for rapid, precise and reproducible separations.
