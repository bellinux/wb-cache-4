Finally, on March 13, it was announced that WWE had officially released Hager from his contract.|$|E
5|$|However, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) {{criticized the}} design of Grandpa Boris and charged it with being anti-Semitic. The {{controversy}} erupted when a 1998 Rugrats comic strip was published, featuring Boris in a synagogue reciting the Mourner's Kaddish. The ADL issued a <b>statement</b> <b>saying</b> that the design resembled Nazi-era depictions of Jews, {{and the fact that}} the character was reciting the sacred prayer perverted its solemnity. The Washington Post, the newspaper who published the strip, issued a similar statement in their Editor's Note section, criticizing Nickelodeon for not showing better judgment in editing the strip.|$|E

5|$|In late October 2009, Halcyon {{announced}} it would auction off the rights to future Terminator material and was seeking $60–70 million, though the only offer made was by director Joss Whedon for $10,000. In December 2009, Halcyon issued a <b>statement</b> <b>saying</b> {{that they were looking}} at various options including sale and refinancing of the rights with an announcement on the outcome no later than February 1, 2010. On February 8, 2010, an auction was held to determine the owner of the Terminator rights. After studios Sony Pictures and Lionsgate bid separately, Pacificor, the hedge fund that pushed Halcyon into bankruptcy, made a deal for $29.5 million. Pacificor hired an agency to sell off the rights to the franchise.|$|E
5|$|The Calais migrant crisis led to {{escalating}} {{tension between}} the UK and France {{in the summer of}} 2015. The UK blamed France for not doing enough to stop migrants from entering the tunnel or making attempts to scale fences built along the border. The British Prime Minister David Cameron released a <b>statement</b> <b>saying</b> that illegal immigrants would be removed from the UK even if they reached the island. To discourage migrants and refugees from jumping on train shuttles at Calais, the UK government supplied fencing to be installed in the Eurotunnel where the vehicles are loaded onto train shuttles in Calais.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvement}} in running {{time and the}} wide broadcast of the race results provided a public demonstration of how the blade length affects performance. Pistorius' stride length was actually 9 percent longer (2.2m vs 2.0m), but Oliveira took more strides (99 vs 92). The combination of stride length and stride rate led to a clearly unusual performance with the longer blades. Pistorius' management issued a <b>statement</b> <b>saying</b> that Pistorius is always 1.84 meters tall, regardless of what prostheses he wears, and {{that the decision to}} maintain this height for his running blades was an issue of fairness.|$|E

Bindrich issued a <b>statement</b> <b>saying</b> that he did not accept the decision of the board, and issued an appeal against the decision of the President of the German Chess Federation.

A Martin bar {{had not yet been}} fitted on Mainliner Idaho. United Airlines also said a program had begun to install reverse thrust indicator lights on all their DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft. The signals, fitted in the cockpit of the aircraft, would have warned the flight crew that the thrust lever had been pulled back too far, and the propellers had been reversed.|$|E
5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a <b>statement</b> <b>saying</b> they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E

5|$|On February 22, 1972, the {{governors}} of the Passamaquoddy tribes at Indian Township and Pleasant Point {{wrote a letter to}} Louis R. Bruce, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, asking him to initiate such a lawsuit before the July 18th deadline. In early March, Bruce {{sent a letter to the}} Department of the Interior recommending that the tribes' request be granted. No reply was forthcoming before April 1. Tureen met with William Gershuny, the Associate Solicitor for Indian Affairs, who said more time was needed. On mid-May, Tureen persuaded Governor Kenneth Curtis to issue a public <b>statement</b> <b>saying</b> that the Passamaquoddy deserved their date in court. Senators Margaret Chase Smith (R-ME) and Edmund S. Muskie (D-ME) and Representatives William Hathaway (D-ME) and Peter Kyros (D-ME) also issued similar statements of support.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, 2011, Universal Pictures {{announced}} that Tower Heist {{would be made}} available for home viewing via parent company Comcast's video on demand system three weeks after its theatrical debut at the rental cost of $59.99. The move was announced as a test case, to be conducted only in Atlanta and Portland. The move met with criticism from cinema chains over concern that the test and any further future implementation would impact ticket sales. The following day, Cinemark Theatres the third largest cinema chain in the United States threatened to not show the film at all if Universal proceeded with the test. On October 11, 2011, several independent theater chains, including Galaxy Theatres, Regency Theatres and Emagine Theatres, and small cinema houses representing approximately 50 screens across the country, also threatened not to play Tower Heist. The following day the chains were joined by 950-screen National Amusements theater chain. In response, Universal Pictures released a <b>statement</b> <b>saying</b> that they would no longer pursue the proposed test.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, The Last Story topped Japanese gaming charts, selling 114,722 units. Assessments by Media Create {{stated that}} while the game had {{achieved}} higher sales than Xenoblade Chronicles due to higher interest in the title, Wii hardware sales remained low, indicating that the title was mostly bought by gamers who already owned a Wii console. By the end of 2011, the game sold just over 157,000 units. Upon its release in the UK, it debuted at #15. After the release of The Last Story in North America, Xseed Games released a <b>statement</b> <b>saying</b> that The Last Story was their most successful title to date, with its Premium Edition selling out quickly and needing to be replaced with a different special edition.|$|E

5|$|In July 1999, Nader {{was let go}} from All My Children due to {{budgetary}} considerations, however, {{he later}} returned in May 2000. The following year, the actor's arrest brought him and the character {{to the center of}} a large fan campaign organized by a group called the Loyalists, as well as a highly publicized lawsuit catching the attention of People and Entertainment Tonight, among other media outlets. As a result, Nader was let go again by the soap opera, with an official <b>statement</b> <b>saying</b> they would be prepared to consider having him return once he had addressed the lawsuit issues. The role was temporarily recast with actor Anthony Addabbo, who was negatively received by viewers, and let go shortly after his debut. Nader later stated in an interview that ABC had informed him that they had no intention of ever bringing him or the character back {{due to a lack of}} storyline. In 2004, Nader's suit was subsequently thrown out. In May 2013, after a twelve-year absence from All My Children, Nader was announced to be reprising the role, with his return airing on June 12, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Concerns over future player {{contracts}} {{were raised}} {{just days after}} the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals. Approximately a dozen players, including Marian Hossa, Jarkko Ruutu, Ryan Malone and Brooks Orpik, had fulfilled the final year on their contracts. On June 28, the Penguins traded the contract negotiation rights to Gary Roberts and Ryan Malone to the Tampa Bay Lightning for a conditional draft pick; it became a third-round pick when both Malone and Roberts signed with the Lightning on June 30. Evgeni Malkin was offered a contract from a Russian team in the newly formed Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) worth approximately $12.5million, tax exempt, per year, which would make him the highest-paid hockey player in the world. However, Malkin turned down the offer to remain with the Penguins, and the IIHF released a <b>statement</b> <b>saying</b> that it would not honor the offer, as Malkin was already under an existing contract with the Penguins at the time. Malkin agreed to a five-year contract extension worth $8.7million per year—the same value as Sidney Crosby's contract—with the Penguins on July 2. On July 3, the Penguins agreed to a seven-year deal with restricted free agent goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury in addition to one-year contracts with free agents Miroslav Satan and Ruslan Fedotenko. On October 8, the Penguins made several roster adjustments, placing Kris Beech, who was already in Europe looking for a new team, on unconditional waivers and sending Janne Pesonen, John Curry and Jeff Taffe, who first had to clear waivers, to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. The next day, on October 9, the Penguins acquired Michael Zigomanis from Phoenix for future considerations. On December 19, the team extended their agreement with Maxime Talbot for an additional two seasons.|$|E
