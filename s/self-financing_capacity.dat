40|$|Linking {{banks and}} {{self-help}} groups {{has been a}} major program of German development cooperation since the mid- 1980 s. Given the involvement of GTZ in SHG banking and the outreach of that program in India, the German Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) has proposed to study the impact of SHG banking in India in the framework of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals 2015 {{on the basis of the}} existing literature; and subsequently to examine the contribution of GTZ on the evolution of the program in India. The results of the impact studies indicate that considerable socio-economic benefits have been accruing to small-scale farming households, rural micro entrepreneurs and the landless and have contributed to most impact aspects of MDGs 1 to 6. Most SHG members substantially increase their saving rates. A shift has been observed over time from consumption loans to loans for income generating purposes. Increased savings and capital formation improve the <b>self-financing</b> <b>capacities</b> and even out the household?s cash flow. This in turn has improved their risk absorption capacity and made them less vulnerable. Access to formal finance has substantially reduced dependency on money lenders and has diminished capital costs. The improved access to financial services has benefited SHG members and their households in maintaining, intensifying and diversifying their economic activities, with positive effects on income and employment generation, especially in the non-agricultural sector. The unprecedented scale of SHG banking and its enormous potential for further growth, within India and without, raises the question as to the dynamics of its evolution, the forces behind it, and the contribution of external organizations. How did it evolve, what kept it growing, and what has been the role of GTZ? The study is mainly based an analysis of documents of APRACA, GTZ and NABARD in the archives of the Development Research Center (AEF) of the University of Cologne and on discussions in March 2005 with key personnel.

Considering this, economic development must based on facts, not on papers. Therefore, considering the economic dimension of sustainable development, {{it is important to}} establish if Romanian companies listed and traded on Bucharest Stock Exchange are able to obtain profit while cash is withdrawn. Even if reported in the income statement, net profit is not simultaneously charged due to accrual accounting that makes the balance sheet provide a static picture of the financial position, while the cash flow statement provides a dynamic picture of it. Therefore, the financial performance analysis based on classical indicators of performance must be accompanied by the analysis of treasury, namely of the cash flow, which provides a comprehensive assessment possibility of the financial performance, flexibility and adaptability of the economic entity, {{in the context of a}} highly competitive and often unstable environment.

While private operators were able to achieve higher levels of cost recovery and to substantially expand services before the crisis, since 2002 their tariffs have been frozen and their <b>self-financing</b> <b>capacity</b> has disappeared. Service providers thus are almost entirely dependent on federal transfers for investment financing.

ANDA's working ratio was close to 1, indicating that the company barely covers its operating and routine maintenance costs. The reason for the reduced <b>self-financing</b> <b>capacity</b> is {{a significant increase in}} the unit costs of ANDA from US$0.21/m³ in 1994 to US$0.46/m³ in 2001, and US$0.63/m³ in 2004. The reason for the important increase of the unit cost in 2004 is not clear, but it could be due to the inauguration of the energy-intensive Río Lempa system that pumps water from the Rio Lempa to San Salvador in that year.|$|E

As most subsidies are granted to and through the energy sector, the analysis focuses on energy issues. A general equilibrium approach {{is used for the}} empirical application. The results fit the theory and show that removing subsidies contributes to eliminating distortions: energy intensity declines, the Gini coefficient drops and general welfare improves. The main effects of applying a cost recovery policy are the improvement of agents' <b>self-financing</b> <b>capacity</b> and of their investment structure. Surprisingly, production cost falls in all sectors, since cross-subsidies are removed. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} is a large part {{proposed}} within the PhD thesis, which has the aim of enhancing the performances of industrial enterprises with mathematical models. The main goal {{is to increase the}} competitiveness, flexibility, adaptability and reactivity of enterprises in the ceramic industry. Since the ceramic sector represents an important part in the manufacturing industry, we focused on this sector, with the aim of evaluating the development of enterprises activating in this domain. The importance of this research lies in its uniqueness and effectiveness, as the performance indicators were analyzed with multiple regression analysis, {{in the case of an}} enterprise that produces technical ceramic products. This analysis generally belongs to the multivariate methods, and it is also an explanatory method of analysis. Regression analysis describes the relationship between a dependent variable and several independent variables. The dependent variable consisted in the size of the profit, while the independent variables were the following: <b>self-financing</b> <b>capacity,</b> return on equity, degree of technical endowment, personnel cost per employee and investment per person employed. The selected variables were monitored throughout ten years. The results showed that three of the variables analyzed are very significant predictors for the magnitude of profit. We could also find significant correlations between the analyzed indicators...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{slowdown}} {{in the first half}} of 1999 as a result of the financial crises in Asia, Latin America and Russia, WIFO expects a temporary decline of the cash flow/sales ratio to 9. 1 percent in 1999 for Austrian manufacturing, as compared to 9. 7 percent in 1988. The survey performed by the Federation of Austrian Industrialists among 200 mainly larger manufacturing firms confirms the temporary decline, but finds it to be marginal only. The decrease in costs, especially labour unit costs but also the falling cost of external finance, prevented any larger drop in profitability. Since the second half of 1999 Austrian manufacturing firms have been back on their expansive course. According to the WIFO business surveys, firms now have more optimistic assessments of their order stocks and expectations of the future business climate. The January 2000 Survey found a subjective feeling that their competitive standing on markets in the EU and outside Europe has substantially improved over the previous year. With international comparative data available only until 1997, Austrian manufacturing has strengthened its position among European countries with regard to both its cash flow ratio and its equity ratio. In terms of its cash flow ratio Austria has approached the top ranks, whereas regarding the equity ratio Austrian manufacturing is still catching up from a position far behind relative to the European average. European front runners in terms of cash flow ratio in 1997 are the Netherlands (15. 1 percent) and Denmark (12. 4 percent). Austria and Belgium share the same ratio of 10. 0 percent. Austrian manufacturing thus outperforms countries such as Italy, Germany and France, where the cash flow ratios appear to be only slightly above 8 percent. In a global comparison within the triad, the cash flow ratio in 1997 was highest in the USA (12 percent), followed by an average of seven comparable European countries (10 percent), and Japan (below 8 percent) ranking last.

40|$|For 1998, WIFO {{estimates}} a cash-flow {{to sales}} ratio of 8. 9 percent, {{approximately the same}} level as in 1997. Surveys performed by the Confederation of Austrian Industry (Vereinigung der Österreichischen Industrie) among manufacturing firms confirm this estimate and likewise suggest no further improvement of profits. During the first half of 1998, Austrian manufacturing performed well and achieved an above-average export performance, whereas {{in the second half of}} the year, especially in the last quarter, demand growth was dampened. The main reason for this reduction in industry growth lies in reduced world demand and, consequently, declining growth in export demand as a result of the crisis in East Asia, Latin America and Russia and the associated turbulent reactions of the financial markets. According to the WIFO business survey, firms revised their expectations of future prices and production downwards in the second half of 1998. The volume of incoming orders and the business climate in general have also been assessed more pessimistically. The same holds true for most of the European countries. On the cost side, the enhanced competitiveness is an important factor of profitability which prevented earnings from falling as a reaction to declining demand growth. In relation to Austria's trading partners, unit labour costs decreased further in 1998 and prices of raw materials fell significantly. The gain in competitiveness is mainly driven by above-average productivity increases rather than reduced producer prices. This has to be seen as a consequence of the ongoing structural change in Austrian manufacturing and it suggests that firms are more and more able to improve the quality and sophistication of their products. With international comparative data only available until 1996, Austrian manufacturing maintained its past position near the European average despite a certain weakening of its cash-flow ratio. The situation is similar with regard to the equity ratio, where Austrian manufacturing – lagging far behind until the end of the 1980 s – continues to catch up relative to the European average. However, as Austria is approaching the European level, the process is slowing down. European front runners in terms of cash-flow ratio are the Netherlands with more than 16 percent (1996) and Sweden with 14 percent (1995). Belgium and Denmark also report a somewhat higher ratio than Austria. However, Austrian manufacturing still outperforms Italy and Spain as well as Germany and France, where the cash-flow ratios are below 8 percent. In a global comparison within the "triad", the cash-flow ratio in 1996 was highest in the USA (12 percent), followed by an average of seven comparable European countries (9 percent), and Japan (8 percent) ranking last.
