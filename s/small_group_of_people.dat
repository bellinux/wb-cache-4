5|$|Stead {{began writing}} the novel in 2002, but her first draft was {{confusing}} and unorganized. To help her, she met editor Wendy Lamb who advised her {{to meet with}} a <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who would help critique the novel. After three years of work, Stead finished the second draft and met with Lamb who once again helped make improvements and later published the novel. Reviewers praised the description of Gracehope and main characters, as well as the performances of Coleen Marlo and David Ackroyd who voiced Thea and Peter in a subsequent audiobook publication of First Light.|$|E

25|$|In 1900 William McDougall was {{appointed}} to a part-time Readership in Experimental Psychology in Sully’s Department. Of this period Dr May Smith writes: `During this time he used to hold informal discussions in his laboratory and gathered there a <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> interested in psychology’. This group formed {{the nucleus of the}} British Psychological Society which was formally inaugurated at University College on 24 October 1901.

25|$|In a {{judgment}} delivered on 16 July 1999 Lord Woolf, the Master of the Rolls, speaking {{on behalf of}} the Court of Appeal, upheld the judgment of the High Court. He held that Coughlan had established a legitimate expectation of a substantive nature {{as a result of the}} promise made by the Health Authority to the patients who had agreed to move from Newcourt Hospital to Mardon House. The legitimate expectation arose from the fact that the promise made to Coughlan had been specific to those premises, expressly made to a <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> within the same category, conveyed in unqualified terms, and repeated and confirmed in representations made to the group.|$|E
25|$|Many {{authors and}} {{scholars}} addressed this issue. Malcolm Gladwell discuses the “Law of the Few” in his book, The Tipping Point. He suggests that highly connected and rare {{people have the}} ability to shape the world. This handful of unique people can spread the word around and create a social epidemic through their connections, charm, personality, expertise and persuasiveness. The notion that a <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> can influence others and cause them to adopt products, services or behaviors was the subject of another book, The Influentials by Edward Keller and Jonathan Berry. This minority comprises a wide range of people who act as experts in their field and their opinions are highly regarded by their peers.|$|E
25|$|A clandestine cell {{structure}} {{is a method}} for organizing {{a group of people}} like resistance fighters, sleeper agents or terrorists {{in such a way that}} it can more effectively resist penetration by an opposing organization (such as a law enforcement organization). In a cell structure, each <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in the cell know the identities of only the people in their cell. Thus, a cell member who is apprehended and interrogated will not know the identities of the higher-ranking individuals in the organization; unless the cell member happens to be a member who necessarily knows and communicates with higher-ranking individuals in the organization. Depending on the group's philosophy, its operational area, the communications technologies available and the nature of the mission, it can range from a strict hierarchy to an extremely distributed organization.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study done}} by social {{psychologist}} Shawn Burn, {{it was found that}} personal contact with individuals within a neighborhood is {{the most effective way to}} increase recycling within a community. In his study, he had 10 block leaders talk to their neighbors and persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without personal contact. As a result of this study, Shawn Burn believes that personal contact within a <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who had friends and neighbors that recycled were much more likely to also recycle than those who didn't have friends and neighbors that recycled.|$|E

The film {{told the story}} of a <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> living in Nevada who were fighting subterranean worm-like creatures. After the film's release, McEntire developed a strong interest in acting and made it her second career. The following year, she starred along with Kenny Rogers and Burt Reynolds in the made-for-television movies, [...] and The Man From Left Field. In 1994, McEntire worked with director, Rob Reiner in the film, North, playing Ma Tex. The film obtained negative reviews, receiving only {{two and a half stars}} from Allmovie.|$|E
500|$|Most of the quatrains {{deal with}} {{disasters}}, such as plagues, earthquakes, wars, floods, invasions, murders, droughts, and battles—all undated {{and based on}} foreshadowings by the Mirabilis Liber. Some quatrains cover these disasters in overall terms; others concern a single person or <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> Some cover a single town, others several towns in several countries [...] A major, underlying theme is an impending invasion of Europe by Muslim forces from farther east and south headed by the expected Antichrist, directly reflecting the then-current Ottoman invasions and the earlier Saracen equivalents, {{as well as the}} prior expectations of the Mirabilis Liber. All of this is presented {{in the context of the}} supposedly imminent end of the world—even though this is not in fact mentioned—a conviction that sparked numerous collections of end-time prophecies at the time, including an unpublished collection by Christopher Columbus.|$|E

500|$|Periyar wanted {{thinking}} {{people to}} see their society as far from perfect and in urgent need of reform. He wanted the government, the political parties and social workers to identify the evils in society and boldly adopt measures to remove them. Periyar's philosophy did not differentiate social and political service. According to him, the first duty of a government is to run the social organisation efficiently, and the philosophy of religion was to organise the social system. Periyar stated that while Christian and Islamic religions were fulfilling this role, the Hindu religion remained totally unsuitable for social progress. He argued {{that the government was}} not for the people, but, in a [...] "topsy-turvy" [...] manner, the people were for the government. He attributed this situation to the state of the social system contrived for the advantage of a <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers {{noted the}} sociopolitical issues that, unusually for an {{animated}} series on a children's channel, run through The Legend of Korra. According to Forbes, by telling [...] "some of the darkest, most mature stories" [...] ever animated, The Legend of Korra {{has created a}} new genre, [...] "the world's first animated television drama". Thill proposed that the Equalists' cause in season 1 reflected the recent appearance of the Occupy movement, and DiMartino responded that though the series was written before Occupy Wall Street began, he agreed that the show similarly depicted [...] "a large group of people who felt powerless up against a relatively <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in power." [...] Beck wrote that The Legend of Korra used magic to illustrate [...] "the growing pains of a modernizing world seeing the rise of technology and capitalism, and taking halting, jerky steps toward self-governance", while portraying no side of the conflict as entirely flawless. Alyssa Rosenberg praised the show for examining issues of class in an urban setting, and a guest post in her column argued that the struggle between Korra and Amon's Equalists reflected some of the ideas of John Rawls' [...] "luck egalitarianism", praising the series for tackling moral issues of inequality and redistribution.|$|E
500|$|After realizing Edmonton as a {{suitable}} place for raising his children, McCauley soon recognized the community's need for a school. McCauley led a group of prominent men and arranged for a school to be built on land donated by the Hudson's Bay Company. The school opened in on January 2, 1882. Three years after {{the opening of the}} school, McCauley found himself and a <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> paying off bills for the school. Initially, McCauley suggested that land owners be taxed with the funds going to the school, but protest followed. McCauley then decided to propose that Edmonton be designated as an official school district by the government in Ottawa, which was voted in favor of following a close vote. The school district was successfully negotiated with Ottawa, and it became {{the first of its kind}} in the North-West Territories. Edmonton became known as having the [...] "finest school system in the west of Portage la Prairie" [...] that set an example for many other following cities. McCauley served as chairman of the newly formed School Board from 1885 to 1888, when he stepped down, although he served as a trustee for 18 years following. He was nicknamed [...] "Edmonton's Father of Education" [...] in honour of his efforts to bring an education system to the community.|$|E
