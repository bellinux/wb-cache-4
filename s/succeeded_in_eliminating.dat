In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he worked to organise support for Diệm as various Vietnamese groups and international powers sought to stamp their authority over Vietnam. Cẩn, who <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>eliminating</b> alternative nationalist opposition in central Vietnam, became the warlord of the region when his brother {{became president of the}} southern half of the partitioned nation in 1955. He became notorious for his involvement in smuggling and corruption, as well as his autocratic rule. Cẩn was regarded as an effective leader against the Viet Cong communist insurgency, which was much weaker in central Vietnam than in other parts of South Vietnam. His Popular Force militia was regarded by US officials in central Vietnam as a successful counter to the communists.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] Baekje kingdom's {{style was}} {{particularly}} {{influential in the}} initial stages of Asuka sculpture. [...] It was in 552 that King Seong of Baekje sent a gilt bronze image of Sakyumuni to Yamato Japan [...] according to the Nihon shoki. [...] Most scholars, based on other [...] Japanese records, consider a 538 date to be more accurate. [...] While {{it is impossible to know}} what this first Buddha in Japan looked like, an image similar to [...] the Yong'a Buddha, contemperaneous because it is dated to 539, leads [...] some scholars to speculate that King Seong's proselytizing image looked [...] similar to it. [...] Another Japanese source, the Gangōji Garan Engi, however, identifies the image as the [...] "prince." [...] This suggests that the initial image was the prince Sidhartha in the pensive pose on the verge of enlightenment, an iconography popular in China. [...] Images in the pensive pose are almost always [...] associated with Maitreya in Korea. [...] However, another iconography [...] associated with the prince Sidhartha is the Buddha at birth. [...] Since this source also lists items for a lustration ceremony some scholars believe [...] that the image was of the infant Buddha.

After state laws experimented, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order 8802 in 1941 set up the Fair Employment Practice Committee to ban discrimination by [...] "race, creed, color or national origin" [...] in the defense industry. The first comprehensive statutes were the Equal Pay Act of 1963, to limit discrimination by employers between men and women, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to stop discrimination based on [...] "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." [...] In the following years, more [...] "protected characteristics" [...] were added by state and federal acts. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 protects people over age 40. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 requires [...] "reasonable accommodation" [...] to include people with disabilities in the workforce. Twenty two state Acts protect people based on sexual orientation in public and private employment, but proposed federal laws have been blocked by Republican opposition. There can be no detriment to union members, or people who have served in the military. In principle, states may require rights and remedies for employees that go beyond the federal minimum.

6000|$|In America we <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>eliminating</b> {{hereditary}} power, {{in obtaining}} a large measure of political liberty, {{only to see}} the rise of an economic power, and the consequent loss of economic liberty. The industrial development of the United States was of course a necessary and desirable thing, but the economic doctrine which {{formed the basis of}} American institutions proved to be unsuited to industrialism, and introduced unforeseen evils that were a serious menace to the Republic. An individualistic economic philosophy worked admirably while there was ample land for the pioneer, equality of opportunity to satisfy the individual initiative of the enterprising. But what is known as industrialism brought in its train fear and favour, privilege and poverty, slums, disease, and municipal vice, fostered a too rapid immigration, established in America a tenant system alien to our traditions. The conditions which existed before the advent of industrialism are admirably pictured, for instance, in the autobiography of Mr. Charles Francis Adams, when he describes his native town of Quincy {{in the first half of}} the Nineteenth Century. In those early communities, poverty was negligible, there was no great contrast between rich and poor; the artisan, the farmer, the well-to-do merchant met on terms of mutual self-respect, as man to man; economic class consciousness was non-existent; education was so widespread that European travellers wonderingly commented on the fact that we had no [...] "peasantry"; and with few exceptions every citizen owned a piece of land and a home. Property, a refuge a man may call his own, and on which he may express his individuality, is essential to happiness and self-respect. Today, less than two thirds of our farmers own their land, while vast numbers of our working men and women possess nothing but the labour of their hands. The designation of labour as [...] "property" [...] by our courts only served to tighten the bonds, by obstructing for a time the movement to decrease the tedious and debilitating hours of contact of the human organism with the machine,--a menace to the future of the race, especially in the case of women and children. If labour is [...] "property," [...] wretches driven by economic necessity have indeed only the choice of a change of masters. In addition to the manual workers, an army of clerical workers of both sexes likewise became tenants, and dependents who knew not the satisfaction of a real home.|$|E
