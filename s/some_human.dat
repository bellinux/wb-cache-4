5|$|Termites are a {{delicacy}} in {{the diet}} of <b>some</b> <b>human</b> cultures and are used in many traditional medicines. Several hundred species are economically significant as pests that can cause serious damage to buildings, crops, or plantation forests. Some species, such as the West Indian drywood termite (Cryptotermes brevis), are regarded as invasive species.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 IPCC report noted many {{observed}} {{changes in}} the climate, including atmospheric composition, global average temperatures, ocean conditions, and others. The report concluded the observed increase in tropical cyclone intensity is larger than climate models predict. In addition, the report considered that {{it is likely that}} storm intensity will continue to increase through the 21st century, and declared it more likely than not that there has been <b>some</b> <b>human</b> contribution to the increases in tropical cyclone intensity.|$|E
5|$|When Falun Gong {{was banned}} in {{mainland}} China in 1999, re-education through labor became a common punishment for practitioners. <b>Some</b> <b>human</b> rights groups claim {{that as many}} as 10,000 Falun Gong members were detained in between 1999 and 2002, with as many as 5,000 detained in 2001 alone. More recent estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong adherents are imprisoned in China, with some sources estimating up to half of the official reeducation through labor camp population is Falun Gong practitioners. In some labor camps, Falun Gong practitioners make up the majority population.|$|E

5|$|In many human {{cultures}}, {{the act of}} premastication {{and direct}} mouth-to-mouth feeding is linked with the showing of affection, known as kiss feeding. In the Manus cultures of the Admiralty Islands, the act of premastication {{has been used by}} a women to remind children and descendants of their obligations to her. <b>Some</b> <b>human</b> cultures such as the people of Papua New Guinea in fact use mouth to mouth contact primarily for feeding premasticated food, with sexual kissing only observed after the arrival of Europeans. This form of feeding is believed to have evolved into the modern human acts of kissing and French kissing.|$|E
5|$|Open country species, which {{comprise}} {{the majority of}} bee-eaters, have mostly expanded in range as more land is converted to agriculture, but some tropical forest species have suffered declines through loss of habitat, although no species or subspecies gives serious cause for concern. There is <b>some</b> <b>human</b> persecution of bee-eaters, with nest holes being blocked, adults shot or limed, or young taken for food. More generally problematic is the unintended destruction of nests. This can occur through cattle trampling, as with the blue-headed bee-eater in Kenya, or loss of forests, with massive conversion of native forest to oil palm plantations in Malaysia being particularly concerning.|$|E
5|$|Other common {{household}} {{substances that}} should be used with caution around cats include mothballs and other naphthalene products. Phenol-based products (e.g. Pine-Sol, Dettol/Lysol or hexachlorophene) are often used for cleaning and disinfecting near cats' feeding areas or litter boxes, but these can sometimes be fatal. Ethylene glycol, often used as an automotive antifreeze, is particularly appealing to cats, and {{as little as a}} teaspoonful can be fatal. <b>Some</b> <b>human</b> foods are toxic to cats; for example chocolate can cause theobromine poisoning, although (unlike dogs) few cats will eat chocolate. Large amounts of onions or garlic are also poisonous to cats. Many houseplants are also dangerous, such as Philodendron species and the leaves of the Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum), which can cause permanent and life-threatening kidney damage.|$|E

5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes <b>some</b> <b>human</b> understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} pancake {{machines}} exist, {{such as those}} that run pancake batter through a heated conveyor inside of a box unit, and those that automatically drop pancake batter onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of a pancake simultaneously. Semi-automatic pancake machines also exist, which require <b>some</b> <b>human</b> interaction to function, such as the pouring of batter. Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the waste of stale pancake batter. Some hotels have pancake machines that guests are allowed to operate. They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges and hotels.|$|E
5|$|While {{he reads}} the diary {{over the course of}} several months, Jake is confronted by his {{siblings}} about his own view of humans. He spends time with his sister’s human fiancée and visits the set of a film in which his brother stars. Jake is introduced to a human actress whom he finds attractive. As he reaches the end of his father’s diary, there is an entry detailing a time Jake was attacked by <b>some</b> <b>human</b> boys as a child. Jake, who had repressed the memory, discusses it with his mother. He learns the attack was stopped by members of ‘’Gallus Rex’’, an anti-human chicken group. Their actions colored Jake’s perception, and Elmer recorded his concerns about their effect on Jake in his diary.|$|E

5|$|Grappling {{with family}} challenges, Vonnegut {{continued}} to write, publishing novels vastly dissimilar {{in terms of}} plot. The Sirens of Titan (1959) features a Martian invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire, Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in a time warp {{that allows him to}} appear on Earth every 59 days. The billionaire learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, who need a replacement part that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return home—human history has been manipulated to produce it. <b>Some</b> <b>human</b> structures, such as the Kremlin, are coded signals from the aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain what to think of the book, with one comparing it to Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann.|$|E
