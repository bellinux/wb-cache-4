40|$|Selective {{hydrogenation}} is {{an important}} class of chemical reactions {{for the production of}} <b>speciality</b> chemicals, <b>pharmaceuticals</b> and petrochemicals. The challenges in this type of reactions are to control selectivity in hydrogenation of poly-functional molecules, and avoid the possible risk of reaction runaway due to the high exothermisity. In this project the fundamentals of liquid-phase hydrogenation reactions in a structured compact multifunctional reactor were investigated. This technology represents an advance over the existing hydrogenation technologies because it exploits the effects of reduced characteristic paths of mass and heat transfer, attained in compact reactor architecture with mm-scale reaction channels and integrated static mixers and micro-heat exchangers. Catalysts based on mesoporous synthetic carbons were developed especially for preparing micro-packed beds in the compact reactor. The investigation resulted in fundamental information on reactor performance for selected model reactions, heat transfer efficiency of the integrated micro-heat exchangers, development of continuous tandem reaction, and evaluation of developed catalysts for hydrogenation and hydrodehalogenation reactions under the continuous flow conditions being used. The results demonstrate that the structured compact multifunctional reactor might be a promising technology to transfer conventional heterogeneous catalysis to flow regime.

40|$|Batch {{plants are}} the best option to {{manufacture}} relatively small quantities of <b>speciality</b> chemicals, <b>pharmaceuticals</b> and agrochemicals high-value products with variable demand patterns. The most general case corresponds to the so-called multipurpose batch plants where {{a wide variety of}} products with different processing recipes can be produced by sharing flexible processing equipment capable of performing different batch operations. Furthermore, intermediate storage is usually employed to increase the productivity and expand the plant availability (Graells et al., 1996). In order {{to take full advantage of}} this inherent operational flexibility, highly efficient optimization methods are needed to deal rigorously with industrial-scale short-term production scheduling problems. Different MILP-based scheduling models have been proposed to manage the complexity of multipurpose batch processes. MILP formulations provide a rigorous mathematical representation of the problem features that can subsequently be solved through different solvers, commonly LP-based branch and bound methods. Méndez and Cerdá (2003) developed a continuous-time MILP formulation that relies on the notion of general precedence. This model is able to define a single binary variable to sequence processing tasks as well as related storage operations without losing optimality. On the other hand, alternative solution methods have emerged over the last years. This is the case of the S-graph framewor...|$|R

A panel of five clinical pharmacologist classified medicines, according to their intrinsic value, in four groups: (i) 'high value' (41 % of analyzed medicines in 1980); (ii) 'relative value' (12 % in 1980); (iii) 'doubtful value' (3 %); (iv) 'no value' (23 %), and (v) 'unacceptable value' (21 %). Drugs were also classified according to their expected potential of use; and three groups were formed: (i) 'high' (32 %); (ii) 'relatively high' (14 %), and (iii) 'reduced' (10 %). A fourth group of 'not applicable' (44 %) in this classification was formed with pharmaceuticals considered unvaluable or unacceptable in the first classification.

40|$|Chemical batch {{processes}} are typically {{used for the}} production of <b>speciality</b> chemicals and <b>pharmaceuticals.</b> Due to the still growing importance of this type of processing, design methods are required that take into account the special requirements and constraints in the corresponding production facilities. We developed a method that optimizes the design of a single chemical process to be implemented in an existing multi-purpose batch plant, in which a well-defined set of equipment units is available for realizing this process. In the optimization, three objectives with different priorities are considered. A flexible metaheuristic algorithm, Tabu Search (TS), has been implemented to solve this multi-objective combinatorial non-linear problem. We started from a basic form of TS to determine the effectiveness of this version as well as establish the relative strengths and weaknesses of first level TS strategies. Our investigation includes a thorough examination of algorithm parameters and of implementation issues to identify algorithm settings that can handle the whole class of problems considered. Overall, we concluded that the basic form of TS—using fixed default settings—exhibits highly attractive performance features for solving the problems at hand. Moreover, comparison with a multi-start steepest descent algorithm shows that a basic TS approach conducts a global search more effectively. As illustrated by three case studies, the new method is well suited for identifying optimal designs of a chemical process to be implemented in an existing multi-purpose batch plant. The approach is particularly suited for considering multiple prioritized objectives an...|$|R
5000|$|The {{coal and}} {{shipbuilding}} industry that once dominated the North East suffered a marked decline {{during the second}} half of the 20th century. Tyneside is now re-inventing itself as an international centre of art, culture and through The Centre For Life, scientific research, especially in healthcare and biotechnology. Newcastle University is now a leading institution in the development of stem cell technology being the first in the United Kingdom and the second institution in Europe to obtain a licence to do such work. Sunderland suffered economic decline during the last century, but is now becoming an important area for quaternary industry, bioscience, computing and high technology. The Sunderland economy is now dominated by the Nissan's European car manufacturing facility and supply chain which is also leading that company's development of electric vehicles. The economy of Teesside continues to be largely based on the petrochemical, commodity chemical and steel industries that form a significant part of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC), but newer industries such as offshore engineering and digital computing, particularly in the new field of [...] "gaming" [...] have emerged from Teesside University. Northumberland, although largely rural and an important tourist location with its castles, beaches and history has a nationally significant concentration of pharmaceutical manufacturing companies around Cramlington and Prudhoe. The County also has seen a huge investment into the creation of the UKs largest reservoir Kielder Water which enables the whole Northeast region to have excess water reserves that it can use to attract more industry. Kielder forest around the reservoir is known to be the darkest place in England, making it an ideal location for professional and amateur astronomers. The City of Durham with its highly regarded University, Castle and Cathedral attracts many tourists and is based in largely rural County Durham which also has a significant number of knowledge intensive businesses (KIBS) in architecture, engineering, technology and measurement science. At Sedgefield in County Durham, Netpark is home to the Centre for Process Innovation's Printable Electronics Technology Centre, a nationally important centre for the development of printed electronics and a number of other emerging electronics companies such as Kromek.At the start of the 20th century, Middlesbrough produced one third of the nation's iron output. Middlesbrough firm Dorman Long put that steel to good use building bridges across the world. The firm's most famous creations include not only the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Tyne Bridge in nearby Newcastle upon Tyne, but also the distinctive Newport Lifting Bridge in Middlesbrough. The town's most famous bridge, though, is the Transporter Bridge, built over 100 years ago. Bridge Building and large structure works is still a significant engineering capability on Teesside, for example local firm Cleveland Bridge built the arch that now towers over Wembley Stadium.Today, the members of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC) represent about one third of the regional industrial economy. They are commodity chemical, petrochemical, <b>speciality</b> chemical, <b>pharmaceutical,</b> biotechnology, polymer, renewable material and renewable energy companies and associated supply chain. The commodity chemical companies are mostly based in Teesside whereas the pharmaceuticals are based in Northumberland and County Durham. The Teesside industry is located on three large chemical sites at Wilton, Billingham and Seal Sands at the mouth of the River Tees and Teesport, the third largest port in the UK and the tenth in Western Europe and is important logistical infrastructure supporting the commodity chemical and steel members of NEPIC. In the 21st century PD Ports, owners of Teesport, have been developing it as a Port Centric Logistical Centre. This strategy has seen a number of significant importing and distribution facilities for the north of the UK being built at this port including distribution centres for the large distribution operations of Asda/Walmart and Tesco supermarket chains.|$|R
40|$|The use of batch {{processes}} is widespread across the manufacturing industries, dominating sectors such as <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> <b>speciality</b> chemicals and biochemicals. The main goal in batch production is to manufacture consistent, high quality batches with minimum rework or spoilage {{and also to}} achieve the optimum energy and feedstock usage. A common approach to monitoring a batch process {{to achieve this goal}} is to use a recipe-driven approach coupled with off-line laboratory analysis of the product. However, the large amount of data generated during batch manufacture mean {{that it is possible to}} monitor {{batch processes}} using a statistical model. Traditional multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component analysis and partial least squares were originally developed for use on continuous processes, which means they are less able to cope with the non-linear and dynamic behaviours inherent within a batch process without being adapted. Several approaches to dealing with batch behaviour in a multivariate framework have been proposed including multi-way principal component analysis. A more advanced approach designed to handle the typical characteristics of batch data is that of model-based principal component. It comprises of a mechanistic model combined with a multivariate statistical technique. More specifically, the technique uses a mechanistic model of the process to generate a set of residuals from the measured process variables. The theory being that the non-linear behaviour and the serial correlation in the process will be captured by the model, leaving a set of unstructured residuals to which principal component analysis (PCA) can be applied. This approach is benchmarked against the more standard approaches including multiway principal components analysis, batch observation level analysis. One limitation identified of the model-based approach is that if the mechanistic model of the process is of reduced complexity then the monitoring and fault detection abilities of the technique will be compromised. To address this issue, the model-based PCA technique has been extended to incorporate an additional error model which captures the differences between the mechanistic model and the process. This approach has been termed super model-based PCA (SMBPCA). A number of different error models are considered including partial least squares (linear, non-linear and dynamic), autoregressive with exogenous (ARX) variables model and dynamic canonical correlation analysis. Through the use of an exothermic batch reactor simulation, the SMBPCA approach has been investigated with respect to fault detection and capturing the non-linear and dynamic behaviour in the batch process. The robustness of the technique for application in an industrial situation is also discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the late}} eighties, {{when it was}} first mentioned, the {{worldwide}} phenomenon of pharmaceutical counterfeiting is growing. Belgian customs often encounter presumed counterfeited medical products in Belgian airports and ports because of their central position in Europe and their importance in the transit of goods. Further and deeper analyses are required to assess the counterfeit character of these goods and to provide a scientific basis for the eventual legal procedure. As reference laboratory for the federal agency for medicines and health products (FAMHP), the Scientific Institute of Public Health (IPH) frequently analyses illegal and counterfeit pharmaceutical preparations. The present research project was started with the objective of evaluating several existing methods and developing new analytical methods to detect counterfeit erectile dysfunction drugs. This thesis is focused on the analysis of illegal samples of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE 5 -i) containing drugs because these are the most counterfeited <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>specialities</b> in Belgium. The research was divided into a spectroscopic and a chromatographic part: Infrared based spectroscopies have already demonstrated their ability to detect counterfeit drugs. The first part of the study evaluates the capacity of each technique (mid-infrared (mid-IR), near-infrared (NIR) and Raman spectroscopy) separately and their combinations to discriminate genuine from illegal tablets. Then, the Classification And Regression Trees (CART) algorithm has been used to classify the different samples following the classification system of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). The second spectroscopic approach used Raman microspectroscopy mapping to detect counterfeited Viagra®. This technique allows the detection of different compounds according to their Raman spectrum but also the study of the distribution of a selected ingredient among the core of a tablet. The chromatographic part consists of the development and validation of a new Ultra High Pressure Liquid Chromatography method coupled with a UV diode array detector (UHPLC-DAD) and compatible with mass spectrometry (MS) to detect and quantify the three authorised phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil) and five of their analogues in illegal pharmaceutical preparations. This method has been validated between +/- 5 % acceptance limits using the total error approach and has been compared to the official Viagra® assay method. The ability of HPLC-UV impurity fingerprints to detect illegal samples and to predict whether a new unknown sample is genuine has also been evaluated. The developed analytical methods may be included in a general approach to detect counterfeit drugs containing PDE 5 -i. This generic approach may also be used to detect other types of counterfeited drugs but should therefore be adapted for each type of medicine...|$|R
