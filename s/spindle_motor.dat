25|$|A typical HDD has two {{electric}} motors; a <b>spindle</b> <b>motor</b> that spins {{the disks}} and an actuator (motor) that positions the read/write head assembly across the spinning disks. The disk motor has an external rotor {{attached to the}} disks; the stator windings are fixed in place. Opposite the actuator {{at the end of}} the head support arm is the read-write head; thin printed-circuit cables connect the read-write heads to amplifier electronics mounted at the pivot of the actuator. The head support arm is very light, but also stiff; in modern drives, acceleration at the head reaches 550 g.|$|E
25|$|HDD data {{transfer}} rate depends upon the rotational speed of the platters and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, advancing density becomes the main method to improve sequential transfer rates. Higher speeds require a more powerful <b>spindle</b> <b>motor,</b> which creates more heat. While areal density advances by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk {{and the number of}} sectors per track, only the latter increases the {{data transfer}} rate for a given rpm. Since {{data transfer rate}} performance tracks only one of the two components of areal density, its performance improves at a lower rate.|$|E

25|$|A <b>spindle</b> <b>motor</b> in {{the drive}} rotates the {{magnetic}} medium at a certain speed, while a stepper motor-operated mechanism moves the magnetic read/write head(s) radially along {{the surface of the}} disk. Both read and write operations require the media to be rotating and the head to contact the disk media, an action originally accomplished by a disk-load solenoid. Later drives held the heads out of contact until a front-panel lever was rotated (5¼") or disk insertion was complete (3½"). To write data, current is sent through a coil in the head as the media rotates. The head's magnetic field aligns the magnetization of the particles directly below the head on the media. When the current is reversed the magnetization aligns in the opposite direction, encoding one bit of data. To read data, the magnetization of the particles in the media induce a tiny voltage in the head coil as they pass under it. This small signal is amplified and sent to the floppy disk controller, which converts the streams of pulses from the media into data, checks it for errors, and sends it to the host computer system.|$|E

In contrast, in CLV mode, the <b>spindle</b> <b>motor</b> speed varies so that the medium passes by the head at the same speed regardless of where on the disk the head is positioned.|$|E

50|$|Dr Ferranti was {{convinced}} that the future prime mover for electricity generation would be through a turbine engine employing very high temperatures. Hall's experience in thermodynamics was crucial to the development and patenting of materials able to withstand these high temperatures and stresses.

Dr Ferranti had already been working for some years with J & P Coats of Paisley on cotton spinning improvements and it was here that Hall developed a small air-lubricated turbine to replace individual <b>spindle</b> <b>motors,</b> increasing the <b>spindle</b> speed from 6000 rpm to more than 20,000 rpm.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the optimal cutting conditions for surface roughness in a turning process. This process is performed in the final assembly department at a manufacturing company that supplies fluid dynamic bearing (FDB) <b>spindle</b> <b>motors</b> for hard disk drives (HDDs). The workpieces used were the sleeves of FDB motors made of ferritic stainless steel, grade AISI 12 L 14. The optimized settings of key machining factors, depth of cut, spindle speed, and feed rate on the surface roughness of the sleeve were determined using the response surface methodology (RSM). The results indicate that the surface roughness is minimized when the depth of cut is set to the lowest level, while the spindle speed and feed rate are set to the highest levels. Even though the results from this paper are process specific, the methodology deployed can be readily applied to different turning processes...|$|R

50|$|Furthermore, the {{mechanism}} used {{to attach the}} platters to the <b>spindle</b> <b>motor</b> was complex and tended to vibrate noisily. Iomega implemented an anti-gyro device (much like an optical CD/DVD drive) within the cartridge to prevent vibration at spin-up, but this device lost effectiveness with age. As a result, the two platters could lose alignment, rendering the cartridge unusable. The plastic tabs attached {{to the bottom of}} a Jaz cartridge could become stripped or broken, rendering the inserted disk physically incapable of spinning up to operating speed.|$|E
50|$|Example: A CNC {{vertical}} mill has {{a vertical}} lead screw on the Z-axis. A low lead screw pitch (i.e. 5 {{turns per inch}} or fewer) means when the driving motor power is removed such as by turning the machine off, {{the weight of the}} spindle will cause the lead screw to rotate as the <b>spindle</b> <b>motor</b> falls down. Obviously this is a bad thing. The solution to prevent back-driving is to use a finer (higher) lead screw pitch (i.e. 10tpi or greater) or have a locking mechanism.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, as many Swiss lathes {{incorporate}} a secondary spindle, or 'sub-spindle', they also incorporate 'live tooling'.

For instance, automatically producing a part with a hole drilled perpendicular to the main axis (the axis of rotation of the spindles) is very economical with live tooling, and similarly uneconomical if done as a secondary operation after machining by the Swiss lathe is complete. A 'secondary operation' is a machining operation requiring a partially completed part to be secured in a second machine to complete the manufacturing process. Generally, advanced CAD/CAM software uses live tools {{in addition to the}} main spindles so that most parts that can be drawn by a CAD system can actually be manufactured by the machines that the CAD/CAM software support.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the empirical model for surface roughness in a turning process. This process is performed in the final assembly department at a manufacturing company which supplies fluid dynamic bearing (FDB) <b>spindle</b> <b>motors</b> for hard disk drives (HDDs). The workpieces used were the sleeves of FDB motors made of ferritic stainless steel, grade AISI 12 L 14. A 2 k factorial experiment was used to characterize the effects of machining factors, depth of cut, spindle speed and feed rate on the surface roughness of the sleeve. The results show that the surface roughness is minimized when the spindle speed and feed rate are set to the highest levels while the depth of cut is set to the lowest level. Even though the results from this research are process specific, the methodology deployed can be readily applied to different turning processes. As a result, practitioners have guidelines for achieving the highest possible performance potential.
