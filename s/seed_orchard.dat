5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} of conserving B.brownii in its present disease-exposed locations, it is an especially suitable candidate for ex situ conservation measures, such as the cold-storage of seed, and the translocation of plants to disease-free locations. Seed of B.brownii has been collected by Western Australia's Threatened Flora Seed Centre, and placed in cold-storage both in Perth and at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank. This includes seed collected from populations that have since become extinct. In 2008, some of this seed was germinated, and seedlings were planted at a location near Albany. Genetic analysis of the seedlings revealed some genetic diversity that was not present in any extant population. The conservation of these seeds had thus preserved some of the species' genetic diversity that would otherwise have been lost through population extinction, providing a powerful example of the importance of seed banking to conservation efforts. A <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> was planted in 2007, and by 2010 this had yielded over 400 disease-free, healthy plants, some of which had grown {{more than three times the}} rate of those in the wild. A 2007 seedling flowered for the first time at Wakehurst Place in February 2011.|$|E

50|$|Seed {{production}} and gene diversity {{is an important}} aspect when using improved materials like <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> crops. Seed orchards crops derive generally from {{a limited number of}} trees. But if it is a common wind-pollinated species much pollen will come from outside the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> and widen the genetic diversity. The genetic gain of the first generation seed orchards is not great and the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> progenies overlap with unimproved material. Gene diversity of the seed crops is greatly influenced by the relatedness (kinship) among orchard parents, the parental fertility variation, and the pollen contamination.|$|E

40|$|Flowers of {{the commercially}} {{important}} tree Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden) Maiden were visited by a {{diverse array of}} insects, but not by birds, in Tasmanian <b>seed</b> <b>orchards.</b> Most species of insects that visited the flowers of E. nitens {{are likely to be}} effective pollinators because all common species of visitors carried many grains of Eucalyptus pollen, and the open floral structure facilitates frequent insect contact with stigmas. Seed production also suggested that a wide variety of insects were effective pollinators because flowers were consistently well pollinated, despite differences in flower-visitor communities among orchards and particular branches of flowers. The generalised entomophilous pollination system of E. nitens suggests that effective pollinators should occur in <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> of this tree throughout the world, provided that flowering occurs at a time of year conducive to insect activity. Although a wide variety of insects appear to be effective pollinators of E. nitens, introduced honeybees, Apis mellifera L., that are often deployed as pollinators in <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> were consistently not attracted to the flowers.

5000|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>orchards</b> {{are usually}} managed to obtain {{sustainable}} and large crops of seeds of good quality. To achieve this, the following methods are commonly applied: orchards are established on flat surface sites with southern exposure (better conditions for orchard maintenance and for seed production), no stands {{of the same}} species in close proximity (avoid strong pollen contamination), sufficient area to produce and be mainly pollinated with their own pollen cloud, cleaning the corridors between the rows, fertilising, and supplemental pollination. The genetic quality of <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> can be improved by genetic thinning and selective harvesting. In plantation forestry with southern yellow pines in the United States, almost all plants originate from <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> and most plantations are planted in family blocks, thus the harvest from each clone is kept separate during seed processing, plant production and plantation.|$|R

How to effectively select populations for second-generation <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> and significantly increase genetic gain through rational deployment have become major issues. In this study, we examined open- and control-pollinated progeny of the first-generation Chinese pine <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> in Zhengning (Gansu Province, China) and Xixian (Shanxi Province, China) to address issues related to phenotypic selection for high volume growth, genetic diversity analysis and genetic distance-based phylogenetic analysis of the selections by simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and phylogenetic relationship-based field deployment for advanced-generation orchards. In total, 40, 28, 20, and 13 superior individuals were selected from the large-scale no-pedigree open-pollinated progeny of Zhengning (ZN-NP), open-pollinated families of Zhengning (ZN-OP), open-pollinated families of Xixian (XX-OP), and control-pollinated families of Xixian, with mean volume dominance ratios of 0. 83, 0. 15, 0. 25, and 0. 20, respectively. Phylogenetic relationship analysis of the ZN-NP and XX-OP populations showed that the 40 superior individuals in the ZN-NP selected population belonged to 23 families and could be further divided into five phylogenetic groups, and that families in the same group were closely related. Similarly, 20 families in the XX-OP population were related to varying degrees. Based on these results, we found that second-generation Chinese pine <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> in Zhengning and Xixian should adopt a grouped, unbalanced, complete, fixed block design and an unbalanced, incomplete, fixed block design, respectively.

Several parameters of gene diversity were measured (number of alleles per locus N a, per cent of polymorphic loci PLP, and expected heterozygosity H, and population divergence D).

40|$|Sexual {{asymmetry}} in Scots pine <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> Abstract: In <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L., {{the reproductive}} process {{is affected by}} the variation among the clones in fertility and abundance of male and female flowering. There were significant differences between the clones in relative proportion of male and female strobili as well as in seed yield. Thus, clones in Scots pine <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> may differentiate into “seed ” and “pollen ” clones. The least fertile clone produce 4. 6 times less pollen than the most fertile clone, while cone yield of the least yielding clones was 5. 5 times smaller than that of the most yielding clones. Amount of the pollen dispersed at {{the upper part of the}} crowns was two times greater than at the base of the crowns. The minimum amount of pollen needed for successful fertilization of an ovule was 1500 grains per cm 2.

5000|$|The optimal {{balance between}} the {{effective}} number of clones (diversity, status number, gene diversity) and genetic gain is achieved by making clonal contributions (number of ramets) proportional (linearly dependent) to the genetic value ("linear deployment").

But the more ramets the larger the share of the pollen is lost depending on ineffective self-pollination. But even considering this, the linear deployment is a very good approximation. It was thought that increasing the gain is always accompanied by a loss in effective number of clones, but it has shown that both can be obtained in the same time by genetic thinning using the linear deployment algorithm if applied to some rather unbalanced seed orchards.

Since few {{forest tree}} gene {{conservation}} activities {{have been carried}} out in the Azores islands with its unique flora, it is urgent to develop a strategy for the management of the Azorean forest tree genetic resources. Safeguarding the potential for adaptation was identified as the prime objective for gene conservation of tree species in the Azores. Three species were identified of potential interest for tree genetic improvement. Prunus lusitanica spp azorica was selected due to its rarity and is close to extinction. Piconia azorica and Juniperus brevifolia spp azorica were selected based on their high wood quality and the interest in these trees by the Azorean Forest Service. Combined gene conservation and breeding was suggested for these species. The breeding of all of these species will follow the Multiple Population Breeding System concept. Open-pollinated seed will be collected for establishment of seedling <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> for each ecogeographic zone (cf Figure 4). Culling of trees with undesired characteristics will be carried out before seed collection. Seeds will be used for establishment of new progeny plantations. For Prunus lusitanica spp azorica only 1 - 2 seedling <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> are suggested. For the two other species several seedling <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> are suggested.
