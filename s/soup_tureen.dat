5|$|In any event, the {{molluscs}} and scavengers did not consume everything organic. Some of {{the wooden}} objects on the ship and in the debris field have not been consumed, particularly those made of teak, a dense wood {{that seems to have}} resisted the borers. The First Class reception area off the ships Grand Staircase is still remarkably intact and furniture is still visible among the debris on the floor. Although most of the corridors have lost their walls, furniture is still in place in many cabins; in one, a mattress is still on the bed, with an intact and undamaged dresser behind it. Robert Ballard has suggested that areas within the ship or buried under debris, where scavengers may {{not have been able to}} reach, may still contain human remains. According to Charles Pellegrino, who dived on Titanic in 2001, a finger bone encircled by the partial remains of a wedding ring was found concreted to the bottom of a <b>soup</b> <b>tureen</b> that was retrieved from the debris field. It was returned to the sea bed on the next dive.|$|E

50|$|John T. Dorrance, {{a member}} of the family owners of Campbell's Soup, assembled, {{starting}} in 1966, the largest representative collection of <b>soup</b> <b>tureens,</b> which has been donated to the Henry Francis DuPont Winterthur Museum.|$|R
5000|$|Holloware (hollowware, or {{hollow-ware}} [...] ) is tableware such as sugar bowls, creamers, coffee pots, teapots, <b>soup</b> <b>tureens,</b> hot food covers, water jugs, platters, butter pat plates, {{and other}} metal items {{that go with}} the dishware on a table. It does not include flatware. Holloware is constructed for durability. It differs from some other silverplated items, with thicker walls and more layers of silverplate.|$|R
60|$|Under Susan's {{directions}} a ration of {{milk and}} water was prepared, and a bottle obtained from the doctor's office. Then Rilla lifted the baby out of the <b>soup</b> <b>tureen</b> and fed it. She brought down the old basket of her own infancy from the attic and laid the now sleeping baby in it. She put the <b>soup</b> <b>tureen</b> away in the pantry. Then she sat down to think things over.|$|E
60|$|So Robin became {{gradually}} {{aware that}} Sam's speech {{was a mere}} fancy, while the smashing of the <b>soup</b> <b>tureen</b> was a hard fact.|$|E
60|$|Whereupon the apoplectic butler whisked {{off the top}} of the <b>soup</b> <b>tureen,</b> and shot, all at once, into a {{state of}} violent activity.|$|E
50|$|In {{the course}} of his life, Santiago Rusiñol put {{together}} a considerable collection of ceramics which today is concentrated mainly in two of the rooms {{on the ground floor of}} the Cau Ferrat, the Kitchen/Dining-room and the Sala del Brollador. Here the visitor will find a varied selection of more than 200 items ranging from the fourteenth century to the nineteenth century, mainly plates and dishes, but also bowls, pharmaceutical jars, washbasins, fruit-stands, pitchers, <b>soup</b> <b>tureens</b> and various tiled panels.|$|R
50|$|Sheffield {{plate is}} a layered {{combination}} {{of silver and}} copper that was used {{for many years to}} produce a wide range of household articles. These included buttons, caddy spoons, fish slices, serving utensils, candlesticks and other lighting devices, coffee and tea sets, serving dishes and trays, tankards and pitchers, and larger items such as <b>soup</b> <b>tureens</b> and hot-water urns. Almost every article made in sterling silver was also crafted by Sheffield makers, who used this manufacturing process to produce nearly identical wares at far less cost.|$|R
50|$|His {{pieces are}} shaped both with molds and turntables. Slips and paints {{are made from}} mineral {{pigments}} and are applied using animal hair brushes, made at the workshop. Petatillo pieces are first colored red inside and out after drying. The major decorative images are first traced on the piece then filled in. The empty spaces that are left are filled in with tiny crosshatched lines, which gives the ceramic its name. The piece is fired for the first time, then glazed and fired again. Today the traditional glazes have been replaced with lead-free versions. Most of the petatillo pieces are bowls, vases, platters, <b>soup</b> <b>tureens</b> and water glasses.|$|R
60|$|Dr. Blythe {{walked up}} and down the kitchen {{for a moment or two}} while the baby stared at the white walls of the <b>soup</b> <b>tureen</b> and Susan showed signs of {{returning}} animation.|$|E
6000|$|And so it {{was that}} Rilla Blythe, who had driven to the Anderson house a self-confessed hater of babies, drove away from it {{carrying}} one in a <b>soup</b> <b>tureen</b> on her lap! ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time in her life Rilla Blythe touched a baby--lifted it--rolled it in a blanket, {{trembling}} with nervousness lest she drop it or--or--break it. Then she put it in the <b>soup</b> <b>tureen.</b>|$|E
50|$|This factory became {{well known}} for its naturalistic polychrome decorations of flowers and insects. Around 1764 the factory {{introduced}} a turquoise enamel. Some of the wares were decorated with fish and shells, seaside scenes and views of the port of Marseille. Production was characterized by {{a wide variety of}} shapes and designs, often extravagant in molding and decoration. Types of decoration are very varied: polychrome on a yellow enamel, imitation Chinese decoration, decoration with fish, landscapes, animals, flowers, decor with green shades. The factory is known for its large <b>soup</b> <b>tureens,</b> which often were decorated with paintings of fish.Statuettes and fancy goods were also produced.|$|R
60|$|Rilla flew upstairs, wishing {{quite frankly}} that <b>soup</b> <b>tureens</b> {{had never been}} invented. But when Jims, at sight of her, lifted his little arms entreatingly and {{swallowed}} several sobs, with tears rolling down his cheeks, resentment went out of her heart. After all, the poor darling was frightened. She picked him up gently and rocked him soothingly until his sobs ceased and his eyes closed. Then she essayed to lay him down in his crib. Jims {{opened his eyes and}} shrieked a protest. This performance was repeated twice. Rilla grew desperate. She couldn't leave Ken down there alone any longer--she had been away nearly half an hour already. With a resigned air she marched downstairs, carrying Jims, {{and sat down on the}} veranda. It was, no doubt, a ridiculous thing to sit and cuddle a contrary war-baby when your best young man was making his farewell call, but there was nothing else to be done.|$|R

60|$|Rilla {{carried the}} <b>soup</b> <b>tureen</b> to the kitchen, {{and set it}} on the table under Susan's eyes. Susan looked into the tureen and for once in her life was so {{completely}} floored that she had not a word to say.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor old man, let um {{have his}} pleasure." [...] And, in the hall, with the <b>soup</b> <b>tureen</b> against her bosom, she hummed above the steam, {{and thought of}} the ribbons on her new chemises, bought out of the {{sovereign}} he had given her.|$|E
6000|$|Robin {{thought he}} {{referred}} to the interruption, but the waiter's eyes and forefinger directed his attention to the <b>soup</b> <b>tureen,</b> which, in his eagerness, he had sacrificed with a stamp. Finding that no further notice was taken of the interruption, he listened, while Sam continued:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{answer to}} the ring, {{appeared}} a page boy with a silver <b>soup</b> <b>tureen.</b> The butler took it from his hands {{and placed it on}} the table, then, standing by the open door, as though about to usher company into the room, he said in a solemn voice: ...|$|E
60|$|The doctor {{walked out}} of the kitchen, looking very stern and immovable. In his heart he knew quite well that the small {{inhabitant}} of the big <b>soup</b> <b>tureen</b> would remain at Ingleside, but he meant to see if Rilla could not be induced to rise to the occasion.|$|E
60|$|Mary Ogilvie {{was in the}} {{meantime}} getting some of the powder back into the tin, and Janet running in from {{the kitchen with a}} maid, a <b>soup</b> <b>tureen,</b> and sundry spoons, everyone became busy in rescuing the remains-—in the midst of which there was a smash of glass.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nonsense! Jem would scorn an heiress if {{she were}} ten times prettier. He will never have an {{escutcheon}} of pretence like {{the one on the}} old <b>soup</b> <b>tureen</b> that the Lady of Eschalott broke, and Jane was so sorry for because it was the last of the old Cheveleigh china.' ...|$|E
60|$|Rilla got the clothes--the cheap, sleazy {{garments}} {{the poor}} mother had made ready {{as best she}} could. But this did not solve the pressing problem of the baby's transportation. Rilla looked helplessly round. Oh, for mother--or Susan! Her eyes fell on an enormous blue <b>soup</b> <b>tureen</b> {{at the back of}} the dresser.|$|E
6000|$|... "Odd's life!" [...] he continued, {{as soon as}} {{the latter}} had {{somewhat}} recovered himself, [...] "beastly hole this [...] . ain't it now? La! you don't mind?" [...] he added, apologetically, as he sat down on a chair close to the table and drew the <b>soup</b> <b>tureen</b> towards him. [...] "That fool Brogard seems to be asleep or something." ...|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{had changed}} there. She {{closed her eyes}} and saw the little dining room in all the dignity of Sunday dinner, the big silver <b>soup</b> <b>tureen</b> {{catching}} the sun, the flowered china with the gilt edges, and even a glimpse of lace paper when the closet door opened; Aunt Mary and Uncle Tom, with Peter between them. And these, strangely, were the only tangible things and immutable.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{think of}} these men, and of the {{formation}} of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company (Applause), and the successful laying of the 1866 cable, and the picking-up and completion of the old cable," [...] (Loud cheers),--("Hm! a decanter gone this time. Will you take your foot out of the <b>soup</b> <b>tureen,</b> sir," [...] from the lugubrious man, and an impatient [...] "hush!" [...] from Robin.) ...|$|E
60|$|So Jims went away--with the <b>soup</b> <b>tureen,</b> {{though not}} in it. Then {{the news of the}} Armistice came, and even Glen St. Mary went mad. That night the village had a bonfire, and burned the Kaiser in effigy. The fishing village boys turned out and burned all the sandhills off in one grand glorious {{conflagration}} that extended for seven miles. Up at Ingleside Rilla ran laughing to her room.|$|E
6000|$|DOLLY (touching Crampton's arm warningly {{with her}} finger). Ahem! (The waiter {{goes to the}} service table and beckons to the kitchen entrance, whence issue a young waiter with soup plates, and a cook, in white apron and cap, with the <b>soup</b> <b>tureen.</b> The young waiter remains and serves: the cook goes out, and reappears {{from time to time}} {{bringing}} in the courses. He carves, but does not serve. The waiter comes {{to the end of the}} luncheon table next the steps.) ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} {{she heard a}} hoarse laugh at her side, and turned {{to see what was}} the matter with the White Queen; but, instead of the Queen, there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair. 'Here I am!' cried a voice from the <b>soup</b> <b>tureen,</b> and Alice turned again, {{just in time to see}} the Queen's broad good-natured face {{grinning}} at her for a moment over the edge of the tureen, before she disappeared into the soup.|$|E
6000|$|Rilla {{thought she}} would never get to Ingleside. In the <b>soup</b> <b>tureen</b> there was an uncanny silence. In one way she was thankful the baby did not cry but she wished it would give an {{occasional}} squeak {{to prove that it}} was alive. Suppose it were smothered! Rilla dared not unwrap it to see, lest the wind, which was now blowing a hurricane, should [...] "take its breath," [...] whatever dreadful thing that might be. She was a thankful girl when at last she reached harbour at Ingleside.|$|E
60|$|Pawkins's {{house was}} {{thoroughly}} old-fashioned in all things, and the Pawkins {{of that day}} himself stood behind the earl's elbow when the dinner began, and himself removed the cover from the <b>soup</b> <b>tureen.</b> Lord De Guest did not require much personal attention, {{but he would have}} felt annoyed if this hadn't been done. As it was he had a civil word to say to Pawkins about the fat cattle, thereby showing that he did not mistake Pawkins for one of the waiters. Pawkins then took his lordship's orders about the wine and retired.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jims is no {{name for}} a Christian child, Mrs. Dr. dear," [...] she said disapprovingly. [...] "Cousin Sophia says it is too flippant, and for once I {{consider}} she utters sense, though I would not please her by openly agreeing with her. As for the child, he is beginning to look something like a baby, and I must admit that Rilla is wonderful with him, though I would not pamper pride by saying so to her face. Mrs. Dr. dear, I shall never, no never, forget the first sight I had of that infant, lying in that big <b>soup</b> <b>tureen,</b> rolled up in dirty flannel. It is not often that Susan Baker is flabbergasted, but flabbergasted I was then, and that you may tie to. For one awful moment I thought my mind had given way and that I was seeing visions. Then thinks I, 'No, I never heard of anyone having {{a vision of a}} <b>soup</b> <b>tureen,</b> so it must be real at least,' and I plucked up confidence. When I heard the doctor tell Rilla that she must take care of the baby I thought he was joking, for I did not believe for a minute she would or could do it. But you see what has happened and it is making a woman of her. When we have to do a thing, Mrs. Dr. dear, we can do it." ...|$|E
60|$|A London dining-room was lighted with gas, {{which showed}} {{a table of}} small dimensions, with a vase of {{somewhat}} dirty and dilapidated grasses in the centre, and at one end a <b>soup</b> <b>tureen,</b> from which a gentleman had helped himself and a young girl of about thirteen, without much apparent consciousness {{of what he was}} about, being absorbed in a pile of papers, pamphlets, and letters, while she on her side kept a book pinned open by a gravy spoon. The elderly maid-servant, who set the dishes before them, handed the vegetables and changed the plates, really came as near to feeding the pair as was possible with people above three years old.|$|E
