5|$|The first {{allegations}} of detainee abuse came in early February 2007, when University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran produced documents {{he had received}} through an access-to-information request showing that three prisoners {{in the custody of}} Canadian military police were brought in by their Afghan interrogator for treatment of similar injuries to the head and upper body, all on the same day. Attaran argued this could be evidence of torture {{on the part of the}} interrogator and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>investigated.</b> Attaran has maintained these allegations, stating in 2010 that the documents show torture of detainees was an actual tactic used to obtain information during interrogation.|$|E

25|$|The Senate {{decided that}} these {{conflicting}} charges <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>investigated</b> {{and the appropriate}} committee to do this was the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, usually chaired by McCarthy. Since McCarthy {{was one of the}} targets of the hearings, Senator Karl Mundt (R-South Dakota) was reluctantly appointed to replace McCarthy as chairman of the subcommittee. John G. Adams was the Army's Counsel. Acting as Special Counsel was Joseph Welch of the Boston law firm of Hale & Dorr (now called WilmerHale). The hearings were broadcast nationally on the new ABC and DuMont networks, and in part by NBC. Francis Newton Littlejohn, the news director at ABC, made the decision to cover the hearings live, gavel-to-gavel. The televised hearings lasted for 36 days and an estimated 80 million people saw {{at least part of the}} hearings.|$|E
25|$|In October 2000, Komnas HAM {{released}} {{another report}} indicating that 23 individuals, including Sutrisno and Moerdani, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>investigated</b> for their involvement; {{it called for}} an ad hoc tribunal {{to look into the}} matter further. With President Abdurrahman Wahid calling for further investigation and the impending tribunal, several military officials made contracts of forgiveness (islah) with victims' families; although the islah did not contain admissions of guilt, it did provide for victims to receive a lump sum of Rp. 1.5-2 million (US$200–250). The first islah covered 86 families, as represented by Rambe, while the second covered Biki's family; by 1 March 2001 a number of islah had been made. As a result of the islah, several victims or their families, suggested to investigator M.A. Rachman that charges be dropped. However, investigation continued, wrapping up in July 2003.|$|E
25|$|It is very {{uncommon}} for patients not {{to respond to}} TB treatment at all (even transiently), because this implies resistance at base-line {{to all of the}} drugs in the regimen. Patients who fail to get any response at all while on treatment should first of all be questioned very closely about whether or not they have been taking their medicines, and perhaps even be admitted to hospital to be observed taking their treatment. Blood or urine samples may be taken to check for malabsorption of TB drugs. If it can be shown that they are fully compliant with their medication, then the probability that they have another diagnosis (perhaps in addition to the diagnosis of TB) is very high. These patients should have their diagnosis carefully reviewed and specimens obtained for TB culture and sensitivity testing. Patients who get better and then get worse again should likewise be question very closely about adherence to treatment. If adherence is confirmed then they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>investigated</b> for resistant TB (including MDR-TB), even if a specimen has already been obtained for microbiology before commencing treatment.|$|E

500|$|During the American megafaunal {{extinction}} event around 12,700YBP, 90genera {{of mammals}} weighing over [...] became extinct. The extinction {{of the large}} carnivores and scavengers {{is thought to have}} been caused by the extinction of the megaherbivore prey upon which they depended. The cause of the extinction of the megafauna is debated but has been attributed to the impact of climate change, competition with other species including overexploitation by newly arrived human hunters, or a combination of both. One study proposes that several extinction models <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>investigated</b> because so {{little is known about the}} biogeography of the dire wolf and its potential competitors and prey, nor how all these species interacted and responded to the environmental changes that occurred at the time of extinction.|$|E
500|$|There are {{divergent}} {{views as}} to whether everyone with an unprovoked episode of thrombosis <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>investigated</b> for thrombophilia. Even those with a form of thrombophilia {{may not necessarily be}} at risk of further thrombosis, while recurrent thrombosis is more likely in those who have had previous thrombosis even in those who have no detectable thrombophilic abnormalities. Recurrent thromboembolism, or thrombosis in unusual sites (e.g. the hepatic vein in Budd-Chiari syndrome), is a generally accepted indication for screening. It {{is more likely to be}} cost-effective in people with a strong personal or family history of thrombosis. In contrast, the combination of thrombophilia with other risk factors may provide an indication for preventative treatment, which is why thrombophilia testing may be performed even in those who would not meet the strict criteria for these tests. Searching for a coagulation abnormality is not normally undertaken in patients in whom thrombosis has an obvious trigger. For example, if the thrombosis is due to immobilization after recent orthopedic surgery, it is regarded as [...] "provoked" [...] by the immobilization and the surgery and it is less likely that investigations will yield clinically important results.|$|E
