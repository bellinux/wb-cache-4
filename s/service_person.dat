The minimum recruitment age is 16 years (although personnel may not serve on armed operations below 18 years, and if under 18 must also have parental consent to join); the maximum recruitment age depends whether the application is for a regular or reserve role; there are further variations in age limit for different corps/regiments. The normal term of engagement is 22 years; however, the minimum service required before resignation is 4 years, plus, {{in the case of}} the Army, any <b>service</b> <b>person</b> below the age of 18.

500|$|The Victoria Cross for Australia is {{the highest}} award in the Australian Honours Order of Precedence. As such, it takes {{precedence}} over all other Australian orders and decorations, except the Imperial Victoria Cross, with which it shares equal precedence. This postnominal is valid only for the recipient and is not transferred to the recipient's heirs. [...] "Tradition holds {{that even the most}} senior officer will salute a Victoria Cross recipient as a mark of the utmost respect for their act of valour." [...] Whilst it has been a tradition for many years to salute a Victoria Cross recipient the Australian Army Ceremonial Manual, Volume 1, Annex B to Chapter 13 states [...] "Victoria Cross winners, unless they are serving commissioned officers in the armed forces, are not saluted". Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston saluted Trooper Mark Donaldson after he received his VC. Under Section 103, Subsection (4), of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the Australian Government pays a Victoria Cross Allowance to any <b>service</b> <b>person</b> awarded the medal. The act set this amount at A$3,230 per year. Since 20 September 2005, this amount has been indexed annually in line with Australian Consumer Price Index increases. [...] This amount is in addition to any amount that the veteran may be awarded under the general decoration allowance of $2.10 per fortnight.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 19th-century, the caste system of Kerala had evolved {{to be the}} most complex to be found {{anywhere}} in India. There were over 500 groups represented in an elaborate structure of relationships and the concept of ritual pollution extended not merely to untouchability but even further, to unapproachability. The system was gradually reformed to some degree, with one of those reformers, Swami Vivekananda, having observed that it represented a [...] "mad house" [...] of castes. The usual four-tier Hindu caste system, involving the varnas of Brahmin (priest), Kshatriya (warrior), Vaishya (business person, involved in trading, entrepreneurship and finance) and Shudra (<b>service</b> <b>person),</b> did not exist. Kshatriyas were rare and the Vaishyas were not present at all. The roles left empty by the absence of these two ritual ranks were taken to some extent by a few Nairs and by non-Hindu immigrants, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|In 1949, Stanley began {{teaching}} at the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario, where he remained for twenty years. At RMC, he became head of the History Department, served as the first Dean of Arts for seven years (1962–1969), and began building a faculty in the humanities and social sciences. [...] He taught the first undergraduate course in military history ever given in Canada and wrote a textbook, entitled Canada's Soldiers, 1604-1954: The Military History of An Unmilitary People (1954), which became required reading for every <b>service</b> <b>person</b> for three decades. His students included John de Chastelain, Jack Granatstein, and Desmond Morton. Thanks in part to Stanley's efforts as RMC Dean of Arts, the Royal Military College of Canada Pipes and Drums were equipped in 1965 with most of their highland kit, including the Mackenzie tartan (RMC was established in 1876 when Alexander Mackenzie was prime minister).|$|E

2500|$|Newsome's {{discharge}} {{came at a}} {{time when}} the Pentagon was conducting an extensive internal review of the [...] "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" [...] policy, ordered by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Michael Mullen. As part of the review, the Pentagon was expected to suggest ways to minimize third-party outings, especially those suspected to be a result of vindictiveness, by relaxing enforcement of the policy. Gates hinted to senators that, in advance of the anticipated repeal of the policy, the Pentagon could enforce the policy more fairly by avoiding discharges on the basis of such third-party outings. Representative Joe Sestak, a former Navy admiral, cited Newsome's case as an example of why President Barack Obama should stop dismissals of gay and lesbian service members while Congress was working towards ending the policy. Newsome initially filed a complaint with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), claiming that the police violated her privacy since her sexual orientation had nothing to do with the police investigation. With help from her lawyers at the ACLU, she sought $800,000 from Rapid City Mayor Alan Hanks and the city council to compensate for her financial losses, which include loss of the chance to qualify for a retirement plan worth $500,000 or more. She also asked for an apology and a new police policy barring the department from releasing information about someone's sexual orientation. Rapid City Police Department police chief Steve Allender said that the marriage license was relevant to the investigation because it revealed both the relationship between the two women and their residency. They also insisted that they always notify the military if a <b>service</b> <b>person</b> is involved in an investigation, and later said that Newsome was suspected of harboring a fugitive.|$|E
2500|$|But Roberts {{distinguished}} Grutter {{from this}} case, {{and argued that}} this case was more similar to Gratz v. Bollinger. In Grutter, the interest was student body diversity [...] "in the context of higher education," [...] and was not focused on race alone but encompassed [...] "all factors that may contribute to student body diversity". [...] The Grutter Court quoted the articulation of diversity from Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, noting that [...] "it is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage {{of the student body}} is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups, that can justify the use of race." [...] What was upheld in Grutter was consideration of [...] "a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element." [...] "The entire gist of the analysis in Grutter was that the admissions program at issue there focused on each applicant as an individual, and not simply {{as a member of a}} particular racial group." [...] As the Grutter Court explained, [...] "he importance of this individualized consideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions program is paramount." [...] The point of the narrow tailoring analysis in which the Grutter Court engaged was to ensure that the use of racial classifications was indeed part of a broader assessment of diversity, and not simply an effort to achieve racial balance, which the Court explained would be [...] "patently unconstitutional." [...] In the present cases, by contrast, race is not considered as part of a broader effort to achieve [...] "exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints," [...] ibid.; race, for some students, is determinative standing alone. [...] Even when it comes to race, the plans here employ only a limited notion of diversity, viewing race exclusively in white/nonwhite terms in Seattle and black/"other" [...] terms in Jefferson County. [...] "The way Seattle classifies its students bears this out. Upon enrolling their child with the district, parents are required to identify their child as a member of a particular racial group. If a parent identifies more than one race on the form, [...] "he application will not be accepted and, if necessary, the enrollment <b>service</b> <b>person</b> taking the application will indicate one box.""

50|$|RTU'ing is {{a concept}} used {{during a period of}} {{specialist}} training, whereby a <b>service</b> <b>person</b> has been extracted or detached from their home unit. For example, if a <b>service</b> <b>person</b> has been extracted to complete an instruction course run by a specialist unit within the armed forces such as a PTI or Range Control course. In the event of the <b>service</b> <b>person</b> wishing to withdraw from the course (e.g. for personal or medical reasons); or if the course supervisors deem that the <b>service</b> <b>person</b> is unfit to complete the course, for either medical or disciplinary reasons, the <b>service</b> <b>person</b> may be returned to their home unit. If a candidate is RTU'd, the supervisor responsible for sending them home will supply a written report to the service person's OC detailing the reason why they have been RTU'd. If a <b>service</b> <b>person</b> is RTU'd on disciplinary grounds, their OC will decide if any further disciplinary action is needed, based on the RTU report from the course supervisor, and if necessary, by consultation with the course supervisors. The reason this is done is that, according to military law, disciplinary action such as a court-martial can only by issued against a <b>service</b> <b>person</b> by their home unit.|$|E
