60|$|But {{money is}} not only to be spent; it has also to be earned. It is not merely a {{convenience}} or a necessary in social life; but it is the coin in which mankind pays his wages to the individual man. And from this side, the question of money has a very different <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>application.</b> For no man can be honest who does not work. Service for service. If the farmer buys corn, and the labourer ploughs and reaps, and the baker sweats in his hot bakery, plainly you who eat must do something in your turn. It is not enough to take off your hat, or to thank God upon your knees for the admirable constitution of society and your own convenient situation in its upper and more ornamental stories. Neither is it enough to buy the loaf with a sixpence; for then you are only changing the point of the inquiry; and you must first have bought the sixpence. Service for service: how have you bought your sixpences? A man of spirit desires certainty in a thing of such a nature; he must see to it that there is some reciprocity between him and mankind; that he pays his expenditure in service; that he has not a lion's share in profit and a drone's in labour; and is not a sleeping partner and mere costly incubus on the great mercantile concern of mankind.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{diazonium}} salts for {{aryl radical}} generation and C-H arylation processes {{has been known}} since 1896 when Pschorr first used the reaction for intramolecular cyclizations. Meerwein developed it further in the early 1900 s into a general arylation method. However, this reaction could not compete with the transition-metal-mediated formation of C(sp 2) -C(sp 2) bonds. The replacement of the copper catalyst with iron and titanium compounds improved the situation, {{but the use of}} photocatalysis to induce the one-electron reduction and activation of the diazonium salts is even more advantageous.
