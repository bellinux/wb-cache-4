The rest of the video features Harris and Tempah in a dark room with scantily-clad women, with Harris sitting inside a car and Tempah outside it. There are also <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> <b>drinking,</b> drugs, violence, arson, sex, twerking and nudity, as well as Harris and Tempah meeting up with the devil.

5000|$|The film {{opens with}} a montage showing Duane's slide into alcoholism: {{starting}} with a happy family meal; moving onto a <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> him <b>drinking</b> casually at home; then a <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> him <b>drinking</b> in a bar after work; then coming home drunk, leaving {{the car with the}} door wide open and half on the curb while he is crashed out on the bed—still in his work clothes from his overnight shift as a floor manager or [...] "pit boss" [...] at Caesars Palace casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The montage culminates when Duane is pulled over after continually swerving across the road. Duane is drunk, but the policeman, a close friend, offers to take him home. Duane agrees but his friend's leniency changes after Duane tells him his daughter is in the back seat.|$|R
5000|$|Lindegren is {{associated}} with the Düsseldorf school of painting. She painted portraits and genre and was inspired by Adolph Tidemand, Hans Gude and Per Nordenberg and the contemporary German style. The painting she sent home from her studies in Paris was a <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> the <b>drinking</b> <b>of</b> alcohol, which according to the academy was [...] "for a woman a surprising motive" [...] and [...] "This drinking scene bears no traces to have [...] painted by a spinster".|$|R
25|$|Carmina Burana (abbreviated CB) is a {{manuscript}} written in 1230 by two different scribes {{in an early}} gothic minuscule (small letters; what is today called lower-case, as opposed to majuscule – large, capital, upper-case, used in Roman manuscripts) on 119 sheets of parchment. In the 14th century, a number of free pages, cut of a slightly different size, were attached {{at the end of}} the text. At some point in the Late Middle Ages the handwritten pages were bound into a small folder, called the Codex Buranus. However, in the process of binding, the text was placed partially out of order, and some pages were most likely lost as well. The manuscript contains eight miniatures: the rota fortunae (which actually is an illustration from the songs CB 14–18, but was placed by the book binder as the cover), an imaginative forest, a pair <b>of</b> lovers, <b>scenes</b> from the story of Dido and Aeneas, a <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>drinking</b> beer, and three <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> playing games – dice, tables, and chess.|$|R

50|$|The {{black-and-white}} video, {{interspersed with}} some color, {{is set in}} a trailer park in the summer. A variety <b>of</b> <b>scenes,</b> unrelated to each other, are shown, starting with a boy being stopped by a woman from taking food off a table. The boy returns as Eminem and chokes the woman. In one version, the video shows him beating her and throwing her on a bed. The video also includes <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> people <b>drinking</b> and swimming in a pool. Additional scenes include aliens, a clown, and people eating watermelons.|$|R
50|$|Like many American {{films of}} the time, The Family Skeleton was subject to cuts by city and state film {{censorship}} boards.

5000|$|Best {{known for}} painted scenes that include her friends cavorting in places of {{specific}} privilege (such as art collectors' homes), Brown gained notoriety in October 2000 when the New York Times Magazine ran an 8-page spread of her watercolors posing as fashion editorial. This publication coincided with her debut exhibition at D'Amelio Terras gallery in Chelsea, titled What! Are You Jealous? (featuring <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> women <b>drinking</b> champagne poolside in Beverly Hills-ish backyards, {{with the title}} borrowed from a Gauguin painting of Tahitian women lounging likewise), which was attacked by Times critic Michael Kimmelman who called the buzz around her work a [...] "pseudo-event".|$|R
5000|$|Director Brian Baugh was {{surprised}} at the grittiness of the script, in stark contrast to many other Christian films. The movie includes <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> teen <b>drinking,</b> marijuana smoking, cutting (inflicting self-injury), moderate profanity, and implications of sex. [...] Baugh none the less decided to keep these elements in to make the film a more realistic depiction of typical teens. Actor Randy Wayne, the star of the film, said he originally rejected the idea of starring because it was being made with a low budget, but he eventually accepted the offer and offered to do it for free. The film has been marketed in a grassroots fashion, a tactic that proved successful for low-budget Christian films like Fireproof.|$|R
5000|$|According to Houbraken he was {{the brother}} of the painter Frans Hals and was {{specialized}} in small paintings of [...] "conversation pieces" [...] or [...] "merry companies" [...] (Dutch: Gezelschapjes), <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> small groups <b>drinking</b> and enjoying themselves. The Haarlem writer Samuel Ampzing mentions both brothers in his Praise of Haarlem with a poem stating that both brothers were exceptional; Frans painting his portraits [...] "awake", and Dirck painting his figures [...] "purely".|$|R
5000|$|While {{the subject}} matter was taken almost {{literally}} at times (the cartoon often quotes the original novel line-by-line), the approach towards screen adaptation was very light-hearted, as pirates were quite a distant reality for Soviet Union. The pirates play obviously goofy roles, and the whole approach to violence is very cartoonish. The movie drew controversy in 2012 as Russia implemented a new law prohibiting showing movies that have <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> alcohol consumption and smoking to minors. The film uses <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> rum <b>drinking</b> and smoking among pirates excessively; but, at the same time, it stressed that because the bad guys had bad habits <b>of</b> <b>drinking</b> and smoking and good guys didn't have those the good guys won against all odds, as they were healthier. A public outcry {{over the fate of}} such loved childhood classics as Treasure Island resulted in an adoption of a special case that allowed the show of [...] "movies that have significant historical and cultural value", including Treasure Island, to be exempt from the law. The cartoon parodied a number of pre-1970es US cartoons, as well as a few Russian movies.|$|R
5000|$|On 26 June 2009, a {{video was}} {{released}} {{for the song}} [...] "Keelhauled". Alestorm's first music video.

He is promptly keelhauled in a rather realistic manner. As he is keelhauled <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> the band <b>drinking,</b> gambling and engaging in sexual activity aboard the pirate ship are shown.|$|R
5000|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by Trey Fanjoy was released for [...] "Last Call." [...] The video is done entirely {{in black and}} white, and was shot in New York City. In it, Womack is seen strolling {{down the street and}} standing on a balcony of a skyscraper, while <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> a man <b>drinking</b> in a bar follows the song's lyrics. He attempts to call Womack, which prompts her to examine her phone and not answer. Singer Clayton Stroope of the band Thriving Ivory is featured as Womack's lover in the video.|$|R
50|$|Turner placed {{human beings}} in many of his {{paintings}} to indicate his affection for humanity {{on the one hand}} (note the frequent <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> people <b>drinking</b> and merry-making or working in the foreground), but its vulnerability and vulgarity amid the 'sublime' nature of the world on the other. 'Sublime' here means awe-inspiring, savage grandeur, a natural world unmastered by man, evidence of the power of God - a theme that romanticist artists and poets were exploring in this period. To Turner, light was the emanation of God's spirit and this was why he focused the subject matter of his later paintings by leaving out distractions such as solid objects and detail, concentrating on the play of light on water, the radiance of skies and fires. Although these late paintings appear to be 'impressionistic' and therefore a forerunner of the French school, Turner was striving for expression of spirituality in the world, rather than responding primarily to optical phenomena.|$|R
500|$|The film {{received}} mixed critical reception. An anonymous {{review in}} the Batavia-based Doenia Film praised the film's picture (especially its colour) and both Krohn and Boekebinder's acting. A {{review in the}} Surabaya-based De Indiesche Courant likewise praised the film, stating that it [...] "fascinates from beginning to end" [...] and showed {{that even in the}} Indies a [...] "grand" [...] film could be made. However, the review criticised the censorship bureau's failure to catch <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> Frederick <b>drinking</b> alcohol, which the reviewer found [...] "dangerous to the prestige [...] " [...] considering the large native audiences. Kwee Tek Hoay, writing in Panorama, criticised the film extensively, writing that it seemed meant exclusively for Dutch audiences in the Netherlands, as those living in the Indies would {{be able to see it}} did not reflect reality and was in places illogical. He found the colouring one extension of this lack of logic, writing that a violet tinge indicated that the farmers were harvesting rice at sunset– something that never happened.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his piece}} Boborul, Caragiale {{actually}} records the events, revisiting his {{experiences as a}} seventeen-year-old eyewitness (and makes some unverifiable claims, such as having been created a deputy police commissioner by Candiano-Popescu, the latter being [...] "president of the Republic"). His ironic account, centered on <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> excessive <b>drinking</b> and a fête atmosphere, implies that the Republic would have actually functioned as a separate country:"In the space of our century, a very interesting state was born and ended, one that no scrupulous historian should ignore. I wish {{to speak of the}} Ploieşti Republic, a state which, although it has lasted only fifteen hours, has for sure marked a celebrated page in contemporary history. Born out of, through, and for the people, at around two o'clock in the morning of August 8, 1870, the young republic was smothered on the same day, around four o'clock in the afternoon. Never mind! the greatness and importance of states are not judged by their extent and duration, but by the more or less brilliant role they have played in the universal system." ...|$|R

40|$|Marie-Emmanuelle Plagnol-Diéval : Moral {{and immoral}} {{wine in the}} private theatre. This article {{analyses}} the representation of wine, drinkers and drunkenness in the plays performed in private theatres {{at the end of}} the 18 th Century (Collé' s and Carmontelle's "théâtre de société", Collé' s "parades" and Berquin's "théâtre d'éducation"). As private theatres were not subject to censorship they could adopt a realistic approach and provide an historical testimony, as can be seen from the <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> social <b>drinking</b> and the different categories of drinkers depicted. The plays also deal with the symbolic and imaginary aspects of wine, seen as a healthy and fortifying drink, especially when combined with other beverages, such as water or milk. Educational plays, however, criticise drunkenness and the physical and moral disorder it engenders. Typical of the plays in general are drinking songs, references to Anacreon and various comic registers, from farce to the depiction of the character of the drunkard. Plagnol Marie-Emmanuelle.

500|$|In the 1960s, The Crab {{with the}} Golden Claws, along with King Ottokar's Sceptre, {{became the first}} Tintin adventures {{published}} in the United States, in Little Golden Books. However, Casterman, working with the American publisher Western Publishing, {{made a number of}} changes: Jumbo, the sailor who Tintin leaves bound and gagged in Captain Haddock's cabin, as well as another man who beats Haddock in the cellar, could not be black Africans as depicted in the original; these were changed to a white sailor and an Arab due to the American publisher's concerns depicting blacks and whites mixing together. The accompanying text was not changed, however, and Haddock still refers to the man who beat him as a [...] "Negro". Also by request <b>of</b> the Americans, <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> Haddock <b>drinking</b> directly from bottles of whiskey on the lifeboat and the plane were blanked out, keeping only the text. The edited albums later had their blanked areas redrawn by Hergé to be more acceptable, and they appear this way in published editions around the world. Casterman republished the original black-and-white version of the story in 1980, as part of the fourth volume in their [...] collection.
