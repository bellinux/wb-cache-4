5|$|Two {{different}} kinds of spouge were popular in the 1960s, raw spouge (Draytons Two style) and dragon spouge (Cassius Clay style). The spouge industry grew immensely {{by the end of}} the 1970s, and produced popular stars like Blue Rhythm Combo, the Draytons Two and The Troubadours. Recent years has seen a resurgence of interest in spouge among some quarters, with people like Desmond Weekes of the Draytons Two indicating that spouge <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> because it is a national form that can reach international audiences and inspire the nation's pride in their cultural heritage.|$|E

According to Bloom's Taxonomy, the ability to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information or new understandings indicates a high level of thinking. Teachers <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraging</b> divergent thinking and allowing students the freedom to ask their own questions and to learn the effective strategies for discovering the answers. The higher order thinking skills that students have the opportunity to develop during inquiry activities will assist in the critical thinking skills {{that they will be able}} to transfer to other subjects.|$|R

Thus, cessation of smoking in the home <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged,</b> daycare attendance should be avoided or daycare facilities with the fewest attendees should be recommended, and breastfeeding should be promoted.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the possibility of}} single workers infecting partners in their home communities, migrant couples are also at a high risk of infection. In many cases, it was actually the female partner who stayed in the home community who was HIV-positive. Several possible policy interventions exist. First, employers in the area of destination should provide more family-friendly housing instead of single-sex hostels. Second, dealing with the more fundamental aspect of the issue, rural development <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged.</b> If the conditions in the home community were to be altered and improved, there would be less need for the men to seek temporary employment in urban areas in the first place.|$|E
25|$|A {{person who}} is troubled by {{experiencing}} situational anorgasmia <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> to explore alone and {{with his or her}} partner those factors that may affect whether or not he or she is orgasmic, such as fatigue, emotional concerns, feeling pressured to have sex when he or she is not interested, or a partner's sexual dysfunction. In the relatively common case of female situational anorgasmia during penile-vaginal intercourse, some sex therapists recommend that couples incorporate manual or vibrator stimulation during intercourse, or using the female-above position as it may allow for greater stimulation of the clitoris by the penis or pubic symphysis or both, and it allows the woman better control of movement.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{the repercussions}} of gender in toys {{suggests}} that play <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> to be more gender neutral {{in order to work}} towards a desegregation of the genders. Too, researcher Carol Auster and Claire Mansbach promote that allowing children to play with toys which more closely fit their talents would help them to better develop their skills. In terms of parental influence, a study found that parents who demonstrated some androgynous behavior have higher scores in support, warmth, and self-worth in regards to the treatment of their children. Even as this debate is evolving and children are becoming more inclined to cross barriers in terms of gender with their toys, girls are typically more encouraged to do so than boys because of the societal value of masculinity.|$|E

Methods: Students from eight school districts participated in the curriculum. Students from seven other school districts served as a comparison group. Results: The treatment group outscored the comparison group as follows: (upper elementary) knowledge, attitudes and attitudes toward abstinence (p 3 ̆c. 05); (middle school) knowledge and decision-making behaviors (p 3 ̆c. 05); (high school) no significant differences.
