50|$|A sample-based synthesizer's {{ability to}} {{reproduce}} the nuances of natural instruments is determined primarily by its library of sampled sounds. In the earlier days of sample-based synthesis, computer memory was expensive and samples had to be as short and as few as possible. This was achieved by looping {{a part of the}} sample (often a single wave), and then using a volume envelope curve to make the <b>sound</b> <b>fade</b> away. An amplifying stage would translate key velocity into gain so that harder playing would translate into louder playback. In some cases key velocity also modulates the attack time of the instrument, leading to a faster attack for loud passages.|$|E
50|$|After seriously experimenting {{in a small}} Amsterdam theatre, it {{was decided}} musicians can not act {{and at the same}} time play with a true touch. Therefore, clothing, make-up, {{lighting}} and mise-en-scene are used, merely to underline the character of the musician, and emphasize the differences between the musicians on stage, if only by the character of their instruments. The sound of instruments could develop and change during a concert. Voices would pass through a series of timbre changes, to fit to the content of songs. Plus no more fading away of a song, Theaterconcert embraces the art of song-endings. It would be false to the audience to see musicians play as involved as before yet hear their <b>sound</b> <b>fade</b> away. A fade can be played though, by thinning the arrangement or by playing softer and softer.|$|E
5000|$|The video {{begins with}} a few girls fixing cars in an Auto service center located in Bucharest, Romania. Inna emerges from a black car, wearing a black leather bolero, blue jeans, and lace high-heel boots. She then appears texting on her phone to another service guy. The video shows that Inna was tweeting from her account to Thomas11. She giggles and then she is shown waving a tissue, so that a rally race can start. The next scene is set inside a car driven by Inna wearing a grey leather jacket. As the chorus kicks off, she and three other back-up dancers are shown in a dark elevator. The plot moves to a hangar where Inna changes her clothes. In a black party dress, Inna sings behind a lion's cage. As the lion roars, the chorus start once again and Inna's male dancers are shown dancing round a boxing ring. When the bridge begins, Inna is {{surrounded}} by couples kissing and making out. Fireworks are blown out. Play & Win, Inna's producers, are shown playing a Yamaha keyboard and a b-boy is dancing {{in front of the}} crowd. Inna then hooks up with [...] "Thomas11" [...] and the video switches to the human pyramid, then the image and the <b>sound</b> <b>fade</b> away.|$|E

Lynes left the band in 1970 and was replaced in the studio by guests including keyboard player Jimmy Horowitz and Tom Parker.

50|$|The {{film was}} {{restored}} in 2011 by the World Cinema Foundation at Cineteca di Bologna/L'Immagine Ritrovata Laboratory. Unfortunately only one {{copy of the}} film survived the 1980 Turkish coup d'état, and all other copies were seized and destroyed. The one remaining copy was badly scratched filled with mid-frame slices, is missing a few frames, and has suffered deterioration due to it being on color stock film while the film is in black and white.

5000|$|The {{interlude}} {{starts as}} a guitar solo, but the guitar is quickly submerged under {{a montage of}} battle sounds.

Near {{the end of the}} interlude the battle <b>sounds</b> <b>fade,</b> briefly leaving the bagpipes playing alone before the third movement begins. The bagpipe music is a covert recording of the pipers of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards playing [...] "All The Bluebonnets Are Over The Border", captured by Burdon while performing at a school.

50|$|The Korg PS-3010 Polyphonic Keyboard is a {{specialised}} keyboard {{with its}} 48 keys (not 49) and proprietary 60-pin connector that {{connects to the}} Korg PS-3300 via a special cable, the Korg PS-3001. The keyboard has a trigger mode dial selector switch with 5 different trigger modes {{as well as a}} momentary switch for retriggering of envelopes during sustained notes, plus three on/off sliding switches. There is also an X-Y joystick with calibration sliders and separate CV outputs for X and Y direction movements, these can be connected to any of the many CV inputs of the three synthesizer units of the Korg PS-3300 for some advanced modulation control. In fact, if both CV outputs are patched to two of the individual Channel Amplitude CV inputs, it offers an early version of vector synthesis with different <b>sounds</b> <b>fading</b> in and out by moving the joystick.|$|R

50|$|The {{story of}} the revival of Bellanwila Viharaya is closely linked with Attidiya, a village {{adjoining}} Bellanwila. This sacred place was abandoned after the Portuguese invasion of the country’s coastal areas. It was rediscovered by an adventurous monk known as Thengodagedara Hamuduruwo, {{who is said to}} be the founder of Galauda Viharaya. One day in 1850, when he was traveling by boat along the Katu-ela stream towards Pepiliyana, it is said that he heard the sound of drums from a nearby thicket. Being inquisitive, he left the boat and walked towards the sounds. As he approached, the drum <b>sounds</b> <b>faded</b> away and he was surprised to see a Bodhi-tree. Subsequently, he came to discover that this was one of the thirty two saplings from the sacred Bodhi-tree at Anuradhapura. With the help of villagers, Thengodagedara thera cleared the land around the tree and built a modest shelter for monks. With this modest and mysterious beginning, Bellanwila began to attract the attention of Buddhist devotees in the neighborhood.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{contained}} the first recording of [...] "Lament for Brendan Behan," [...] a recently composed {{tribute to the}} late Irish author, Brendan Behan, whom the Clancys had personally known.

[...] "The Little Beggarman"), Makem learned from his mother, Sarah, a source singer for folk song collectors. The <b>sound</b> <b>fades</b> briefly {{at the end of}} [...] "Beggar Man" [...] when Makem danced a jig onstage as the audience cheered. The group learned [...] "Wild Rover" [...] from Luke Kelly of The Dubliners, with whom they were friends. They sang the number [...] "Wella Wallia" [...] (a.k.a. [...] "Weile Waile" [...] and [...] "The River Saile") for laughs, using fake Dublin accents to the delight of the audience.

Finally, we realise that the person now fully dressed in the suit is in fact Matilda, though we do not see her face, and the tie is {{attached}} to the rafters of the bedroom. Back at the shebeen, Philemon is seated, contemplating his punishment of Matilda, as the music and <b>sounds</b> <b>fade</b> to a muffle. Gradually, Billie Holiday’s “Strange Fruit” fades in as Philemon scratches his brow and the song continues to play as Philemon staggers home {{in the early hours of}} the morning. [...] "Strange Fruit" [...] was popular in Sophiatown at the time due to the gradual entrenchment of apartheid laws. Matilda steps up onto a crate, then kicks it out from underneath her and she hangs herself.

40|$|Origin Unknown is a 15 -minute, single-movement {{work for}} orchestra. The piece {{maintains}} an understated, meditative quality throughout, and adheres {{to the principle}} of perpetual variation of a very limited amount of material. The form of the work is process-oriented: the music unfolds slowly, according to a consistent, yet flexible, dialectic. Two basic materials—one that is tonally stable, and another that modulates—alternate throughout the piece and form a harmonic backdrop. A type of respiration occurs, as the lengths of the stable sections expand and contract, while the modulatory passages get progressively longer each time they recur. A surface layer of triplet melodies is superimposed onto this background structure, forming a subtle counterpoint. Percussive, bell-like sounds (glockenspiel, vibraphone, celesta, harp, and piano) articulate most of the pitches in the work. As these sounds decay, they often meld into a wind or string timbre which sustains the pitch after its percussive attack has faded. Eventually, these sustained <b>sounds</b> <b>fade</b> out, just as their percussive attack did, but at a slower rate with a long diminuendo. A regular rotation of the percussive timbres produces a kaleidescopic effect, while the wind and string choirs often alternate in an antiphonal fashion. As the alternating wind and string passages expand and contract in length, the orchestration of the piece effects a "respiration" in the timbral domain analogous to that built into the harmonic structure of the piece...|$|R
