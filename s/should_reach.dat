5|$|Malvern {{lies in the}} Lower Severn/Avon plain affording it {{a degree}} of shelter caused {{by virtue of its}} {{nestling}} in between the Cotswold hills to the east, the Welsh Hills and Mountains to the west, and Birmingham plateau to the north. Although as with all the British Isles it has a maritime climate, the local topography means summer warmth can become emphasised by a slight foehn effect off the surrounding hills. The record maximum stands at 35.8c(96.4f) set in August 1990. Typically 17.3 days of the year will reach 25.1c(77.2f) or higher and the annual warmest day <b>should</b> <b>reach</b> 29.8c(85.6f) according to the 1971–00 observing period.|$|E

The indicator electrode must be suitable for the particular type of titration (i.e. a glass electrode for acid-base reactions and a platinum electrode for redox titrations), and <b>should</b> <b>reach</b> equilibrium rapidly.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} {{attempts}} to remove Moscoe as TTC chair in 1999, following a threatened strike by TTC workers. During the negotiations, Moscoe {{had suggested that}} council <b>should</b> <b>reach</b> a settlement with the workers and then consider a property tax increase to find the necessary revenues. Mel Lastman opposed this proposal, and is widely believed to have coordinated the subsequent efforts to remove Moscoe from office.|$|E

25|$|The small synagogue is lit by windows {{overlooking}} the courtyard. The courtyard location concealed within a residential building {{is typical of}} synagogues built in pre-modern Italy. It was a precautionary measure taken so {{that none of the}} sounds of Jewish worship <b>should</b> <b>reach</b> Christian ears and possibly provoke a pogrom or repressive anti-Jewish measures. This location also permitted Jews to enter the synagogue without going outside the ghetto.|$|E
25|$|Planned {{investment}} levels In 2002 the Government {{adopted an}} ambitious six-year investment {{plan for the}} sector.

The wearing {{of it has been}} {{compared}} to a wedding ring as for most women in south India it denotes that they are married. The thalikettu kalyanam was the ritual during which the thali would be tied on a piece of string around the neck of a Nair girl. If the girl <b>should</b> <b>reach</b> puberty before the ceremony took place then she would in theory have been out-caste, although it is probable that this stricture was not in fact observed.|$|E
25|$|The Environment Agency has awarded Sheffield-based {{telemetry}} company CSE Seprol {{a contract}} to supply flood warning devices for risk areas in East Anglia. The 18 sirens, at various locations around the flood risk area of Grimsby and Cleethorpes, <b>should</b> <b>reach</b> 25,500 households to warn of portending floods. The sirens will be sounded only {{in the event of}} the Environment Agency issuing a severe flood warning for tidal flooding, or if there is a likelihood of the sea defences being breached. The sirens make a variety of sounds, from the traditional wailing sound to a voice message.|$|E
25|$|A {{year after}} the disaster, in April 2012, sea fish caught near the Fukushima power plant still contain as much {{radioactive}} 134Cs and 137Cs compared to fish caught {{in the days after}} the disaster. At the end of October 2012 TEPCO admitted that it could not exclude radioactivity releases into the ocean, although the radiation levels were stabilised. Undetected leaks into the ocean from the reactors, could not be ruled out, because their basements remain flooded with cooling water, and the 2,400-foot-long steel and concrete wall between the site’s reactors and the ocean, that <b>should</b> <b>reach</b> 100feet underground, was still under construction, and would not be finished before mid-2014. Around August 2012 two greenling were caught close to the Fukushima shore, they contained more than 25,000 becquerels a kilogram of cesium, the highest cesium levels found in fish since the disaster and 250 times the government’s safety limit.|$|E

25|$|In the {{simplest}} terms, collective memory {{can be understood}} as the memory of a group of people, and is usually associated with the passing of that memory from generation to generation. However, there are many nuances to this idea; it must also be considered in terms of the processes of remembering and forgetting events. Thus, when a typical emotional event is socially shared and propagates to perhaps 50 other people, that event becomes a collective memory for that group or community of people. When the emotional event is particularly intense, the event would be expected to undergo an even larger diffusion. Furthermore, the more intense the emotional event is, the more rapid the diffusion should be and <b>should</b> <b>reach</b> more people in a shorter amount of time. This is especially true for events that are shared via mass media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, internet, etc. In this case, the collective memory is no longer confined to a local population, but instead can become that of a regional, national, or even international population. Besides the propagation of a single person’s emotional event, many people can simultaneously experience a single national emotional event, such as the disappearing of an important person. Such an event also becomes part of a collectively shared memory. However, {{it must be noted that}} each person still has their own personal memory of the event, such as where they were when they experienced the event, what they were doing, etc.|$|E
25|$|As Hannibal passed Lake Trasimene, {{he came to}} a place very {{suitable}} for an ambush, and hearing that Flaminius had broken camp and was pursuing him, made preparations for the impending battle. To the north was a series of heavily forested hills where the Malpasso Road passed along the north side of Lake Trasimene. Along the hill-bordered skirts of the lake, Hannibal camped where he was in full view of anyone entering the northern defile, and spent the night arranging his troops for battle. Below the camp, he placed his heavy infantry (Iberians, Celts and Africans) upon a slight elevation. Here, they had ample ground from which they could charge down upon the head of the Roman column on the left flank, when it <b>should</b> <b>reach</b> the position. His cavalry and Gallic infantry were concealed in the hills in the depth of the wooded valley from which the Romans would first enter, so that they could quickly sally out and close the entrance, blocking the Roman route of retreat. Then he posted his light troops at intervals along the heights overlooking the plain, with orders to keep well hidden in the woods until signalled to attack. In addition, the night before the battle commenced, Hannibal ordered his men to light campfires on the hills of Tuoro, at a considerable distance, so as to convince the Romans that his forces were further away than they actually were.|$|E

500|$|Jacqueline Fernandez was {{approached}} {{to perform an}} item number in the film, but the producers failed {{to make a deal}} and instead signed Sophie Choudry after seeing her performance in [...] "Aala Re Aala" [...] from Shootout at Wadala (2013). For her first Telugu song, Choudry joined the film's set in September 2013. Sukumar said about the item number, [...] "It's a superstar’s film and it <b>should</b> <b>reach</b> all. Item numbers are common these days and people expect to see them. The situation was that Mahesh had to go to a pub to get information about the person he was looking for. So there was occasion to put in an item number".|$|E
500|$|The {{creeping}} barrage was a barrage that lifted in small increments, perhaps , {{so that it}} moved forward slowly, keeping pace with the infantry, who were trained to follow close behind the moving wall of their own fire, often as close as infantry commanders were encouraged to keep their troops {{as close to the}} barrage as possible, even at the risk of casualties from friendly fire. A {{creeping barrage}} could maintain the element of surprise, with guns opening fire only shortly before the assault troops moved off. It was useful when enemy positions had not been thoroughly reconnoitred, as it did not depend on identifying individual targets in advance. The idea behind the creeping barrage was that the infantry <b>should</b> <b>reach</b> the enemy positions before the defenders had time to recover, emerge from shelters, and man their positions. On {{the first day of the}} battle of the Somme, the barrage outpaced the infantry, allowing the defenders to recover and emerge from their dugouts, with disastrous results for the attackers. The creeping barrage demonstrated its effectiveness a year later, in 1917, during the battle of Arras. A weakness of the creeping barrage was that the infantry was subordinated to the artillery schedule, while the infantry commanders had less control over the tactical situation and were therefore in danger of forgetting how to manoeuvre their troops around the battlefield. The importance of the barrage was such that traditional infantry tactics, including a reliance on the infantry's own firepower to support its movement forward, was sometimes forgotten.|$|E
