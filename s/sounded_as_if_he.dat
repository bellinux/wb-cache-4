500|$|In his 2011 book The Man Behind the Man: Looking From the Inside Out, Demetrius Smith Sr., {{a former}} member of R. Kelly's entourage, wrote that R. Kelly told him [...] "in a voice that <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wanted to burst into tears" [...] that he thought Aaliyah was pregnant.|$|E
500|$|In {{comparison}} to previous albums, which were largely driven by observational commentary on matters pertaining to social welfare, Graduation is more introspective {{in nature and}} addresses personal themes. West stated {{that he wanted to}} make inspirational music and placed more focus on individual perspective and experience that listeners could connect with in an attempt to create [...] "people's theme songs". Dismayed that the messages behind his complex lyricism were frequently lost on listeners and didn't carry well during live performances, West made an attempt to simplify his lyrics and use more skeletal rhyme schemes for more straightforward verses while concentrating on speaking volumes with sparser wording on Graduation. Having committed a significant amount of time towards elevating his storytelling abilities by listening to folk musicians, West manages to form a lyrical narrative within nearly every song on the album. West dedicated a majority of the album towards conducting an analysis himself and conveying his ambivalent outlook on his newfound wealth and fame. As such, West's subversive songwriting fluctuates between playful self-aggrandizement and critical self-doubt. While confident, extroverted and celebratory at face value, many songs contained on Graduation were thematically distanced and retained melancholic subtext. Some music critics remarked that compounded with West's urgent, emotive rapping style, the record <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were experiencing an existential crisis.|$|E

6000|$|... 'If death isn't the point,' he said, in {{a strangely}} abstract, cold, fine voice--'what is?' He <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had been found}} out.|$|E
6000|$|... "You haven't any home!" [...] Chatterer's voice <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn't {{think he}} had heard aright. [...] "What have you done with it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Chick-a-dee-dee, ma'am, chick-a-dee-dee!'" [...] {{answered}} the {{bird in the}} same cheerful tone. And it <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> said, 'I shall be cared for. I'm not afraid.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pisgah--the Promised Land!" [...] Mr. McCabe in {{that passage}} <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were half-way to [...] "Oh! Beulah Land!" [...] and the tambourine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, nothing," [...] said Grandfather Frog, {{trying to}} make his voice <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> weren't interested. [...] "I just {{wondered}} where the long-legged nuisance might be." ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Bracknell. This {{noise is}} {{extremely}} unpleasant. It <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{was having an}} argument. I dislike arguments of any kind. They are always vulgar, and often convincing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we're here," [...] {{said the}} turtle, {{in a voice}} that <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were well pleased. [...] "I thought I hadn't {{forgotten}} my fairy wisdom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, you {{had better}} get their advice. It {{is the best thing}} going!' said Leonard, with a sigh that <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wished he had taken it.|$|E
6000|$|It <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{were asking}} if he had caught cold or hurt his foot, and Strether for a minute but smoked and smoked. [...] "I {{want to see her}} again. I must see her." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Penguin Guide to Jazz {{observes that}} [...] "Brown <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> looking for {{extremes}} which don't really suit him. But some passages offer gripping and wholly absorbing playing." ...|$|R
6000|$|He went away, and Eveline Annersly {{smiled at}} her companion. [...] "You'll simply {{have to put up}} with it," [...] she said. [...] "It really doesn't <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was very ill." ...|$|R
60|$|Lord Ormersfield hastily {{turned to}} look at his son's countenance,--it was flushed and melancholy, but fully in earnest; {{nevertheless}} the Earl would not believe his ears, and made a <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had missed the words.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} in the room. Both women were hostile and resentful. He <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were {{addressing}} a meeting. Hermione merely paid no attention, stood with her shoulders tight in a shrug of dislike.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it must be}} citizen Chauvelin," [...] said Heron at last; but {{the tone}} of his voice <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were anxious and only half convinced; [...] "but I thought he would be at the chateau by now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] he said--and {{his voice}} <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had pinched {{it in the}} {{endeavour}} to impress his listener--"that any well-educated man who honestly tries to serve his God has the right humbly--I say humbly--to claim morality." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, mine--!" [...] he {{said with}} the strangest, saddest, yet after all most {{resigned}} sense of surrender of it; which {{he tried to make}} <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> couldn't have told it, for its splendor of sacrifice and of misery, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} on Allmusic, Scott Yanow states [...] "This is a {{particularly}} exciting release... The chord changes might be fairly basic but Willis Jackson plays with such enthusiasm and exuberance that it almost <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had discovered the joy of playing music".|$|R
50|$|His {{recording}} of songs of Charles Villiers Stanford with pianist Clifford Benson was acclaimed in the International Record Review in 2000:He <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has been singing Stanford all his life, and his warm, natural baritone, finely judged legato {{and sensitivity to}} words are a joy throughout.|$|R
60|$|He made {{no reply}} to this for {{he could think}} of no reply that was {{sufficiently}} polite. 'Yes?' <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> meant to say that that was just what he had expected. 'Really?' had a sarcastic ring. He fell back on facial expression, to imply that he was interested and that she might tell all.|$|E
6000|$|... “This,” {{cried the}} young man, with an accent that <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> took a bitter {{pleasure}} in his poverty, while {{he held a}} shilling up before his eyes, “this is all the treasure that I possess—this and my rifle! Now, indeed, I have become {{a man of the}} woods, and must place my sole dependence on the chase. Come, Natty, let us stake the last penny for the bird; with your aim, it cannot fail to be successful.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To own the truth, miss, I heard Mr. Holmcroft in my lady's room. His voice <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was angry. I may {{say they}} were both angry--Mr. Holmcroft and my lady." [...] (She turned to Julian.) [...] "And just before her ladyship came out, sir, I heard your name, {{as if it was}} you they were having words about. I can't say exactly what it was; I hadn't time to hear. And I didn't listen, miss; the door was ajar; and the voices were so loud nobody could help hearing them." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{his review}} of the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that the song [...] "stumbles in its {{attempts}} at seduction." [...] Robert Loy of Country Standard Time was more positive, saying that [...] "for such a young man, <b>he</b> certainly <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knows of whence he sings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, Holmes!" [...] There was a <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{was shaking}} the dying man, {{and it was}} all that I could do to hold myself quiet in my hiding-place. [...] "You must hear me. You SHALL hear me. Do you {{remember}} a box--an ivory box? It came on Wednesday. You opened it--do you remember?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Skouras and two {{brothers}} {{came to the}} United States as immigrants in 1910; Spyros kept such a pronounced Greek accent in English that comedian Bob Hope would joke [...] "Spyros has been here twenty years but <b>he</b> still <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> coming next week." [...] Skouras oversaw the production of such epics as Cleopatra (1963) with Elizabeth Taylor, {{as well as the}} development of Century City.|$|R
60|$|You see Jerry {{had spent}} another long, weary day opening {{the hole in}} the dam once more, only to have it closed again while he slept. That had been enough for Jerry. He hadn't tried again. Instead he had made up his mind that he would find out who was playing such a trick on him. He would just watch until they came, and then if they were not bigger than he, or there were not too many of them, he would--well, the way Jerry gritted and clashed those sharp teeth of his <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> meant to do {{something}} pretty bad.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir. Nothink at all. Mr. Chadbands he wos a-prayin wunst at Mr. Sangsby's and I heerd him, but he <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wos a-speakin to hisself, {{and not to}} me. He prayed a lot, but I couldn't {{make out}} nothink on it. Different times there was other genlmen come down Tom-all-Alone's a-prayin, but they all mostly sed as the t'other 'wuns prayed wrong, and all mostly sounded to be a-talking to theirselves, or a-passing blame on the t'others, and not a-talkin to us. WE never knowd nothink. I never knowd what it wos all about." ...|$|E
60|$|It all <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were {{actuated}} by nice scruples {{and high}} principles; but the opinion is unfortunately not encouraged {{when we find}} him, nevertheless, giving his consent to the marriage of his nephew Alfonso to Lucrezia Borgia upon the pronouncement of her divorce from Giovanni Sforza. The marriage, let us say in passing, was celebrated at the Vatican on June 20, 1498, Lucrezia receiving a dowry of 40,000 ducats. But the astute Alexander {{saw to it that}} his family should acquire more than it gave, and contrived that Alfonso should receive the Neapolitan cities of Biselli and Quadrata, being raised to the title of Prince of Biselli.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2005 {{version of}} the science fiction {{programme}} Doctor Who, various Londoners wonder why the Doctor (played by Christopher Eccleston), an alien, <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> comes from the North. Eccleston used his own Salford accent in the role; the usual response is [...] "Lots of planets have a North!" [...] Other accents in the same series include Cockney (used by actress Billie Piper) and Estuary (used by actress Catherine Tate).|$|R
5000|$|The film {{itself was}} not very well {{received}} and neither was the album. The British publication The Gramophone commenting: [...] "Say One for Me is abysmal. Even Bing Crosby can’t get away with numbers like ‘The Secret of Christmas' and it <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he’s</b> not really trying to on this occasion. The rest is substandard rock ‘n’ roll, a couple of mildewed ballads and the inevitable cha-cha for Debbie Reynolds and Robert Wagner." ...|$|R
5000|$|Scott Yanow of Allmusic states, [...] "In 1968 Baker had {{his teeth}} knocked {{out by a}} group of thugs. In 1969 he {{recorded}} this remarkably bad set of music... Baker, who <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is struggling to get any air at all out of his horn, rarely ventures out of the lower register or away from the themes. He sounds in sad shape, so why does this music repeatedly get reissued?" ...|$|R
