2500|$|The {{original}} protocol has {{a transfer}} file size limit of 512 bytes/block x 65535 blocks = 32MB. In 1998 this limit {{was extended to}} 65535 bytes/block x 65535 blocks = 4GB by TFTP Blocksize Option RFC 2348. If the defined blocksize produces an IP packet size that exceeds the minimum MTU at any point of the network path, IP fragmentation and reassembly will occur not only adding more overhead but also leading to total transfer failure when the minimalist IP stack implementation in a host's BOOTP or PXE ROM does not (or fails to properly) implement IP fragmentation and reassembly [...] If TFTP packets should be kept within the standard Ethernet MTU (1500), the blocksize value is calculated as 1500 minus headers of TFTP (4 bytes), UDP (8 bytes) and IP (20 bytes) = 1468 bytes/block, this gives a limit of 1468 bytes/block x 65535 blocks = 92MB. Today most servers and clients <b>support</b> <b>block</b> number roll-over (block counter going back to 0 after 65535) which gives an essentially unlimited transfer file size.|$|E

50|$|These {{computers}} were {{famous for their}} simplicity allowing people with little technical ability to produce various hardware add-ons such as FDD controllers, AD/DA converters or software (such as Desktop — unique WYSIWYG word processor with functions like proportional text, pictures in text <b>support,</b> <b>block</b> functions, multi-font support etc.). Both version of these computers had been produced in Skalica, Slovakia. Didaktik's glory went out with price fall of 16-bit computers, such as the Atari and Amiga, around the middle 90s until it was finally steam-rolled by the PC soon after.|$|E
50|$|Due to a block cipher's {{characteristic}} as an invertible function, its output becomes distinguishable from a truly random output string {{over time}} {{due to the}} birthday attack. This property results in the cipher's security degrading quadratically, {{and needs to be}} taken into account when selecting a block size. There is a trade-off though as large block sizes can result in the algorithm becoming inefficient to operate. Earlier block ciphers such as the DES have typically selected a 64-bit block size, while newer designs such as the AES <b>support</b> <b>block</b> sizes of 128 bits or more, with some ciphers supporting a range of different block sizes.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of the 2016-2017 school year, the school started a new <b>support</b> <b>block</b> called myTime. It is {{designed}} to meet the academic needs of students during the school day. During this time, students will receive academic support, participate in relearning, make up labs or tests and quizzes, study quietly and collaborate with classmates on group projects. Students can be assigned by a teacher(s)that may need reteaching or assistance in making up missing work. If they are not assigned they can self-select, meaning that they can select where and what to work on during myTime. The block is 35 minutes and takes place between 1st and 2nd period.|$|E

50|$|Consequently, AES {{candidates}} {{were required to}} <b>support</b> a <b>block</b> length of 128 bits (16 bytes). This should be acceptable for up to 264 × 16 B = 256 exabytes of data, and should suffice for quite {{a few years to}} come. The winner of the AES contest, Rijndael, <b>supports</b> <b>block</b> and key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, but in AES the block size is always 128 bits. The extra block sizes were not adopted by the AES standard.|$|R

40|$|Wet lay-up method {{offers a}} great {{flexibility}} for field applications and is generally the cheapest alternative among other methods to bond fibre reinforced polymer composites to concrete. Understanding {{the characteristics of}} the bond formed by this method is essential for its strengthening applications. In this study, twenty-two single shear-lap tests are carried out. The parameters varied are FRP bond length, FRP thickness and <b>support</b> <b>block</b> height. Two main failure types were observed; interfacial failure in the concrete layer just below the bond surface and shear tension failure propagated inside the concrete block. The test results are used to verify an analytical model, in which interfacial behaviour is idealised using a bond-slip relationship and the cracking inside concrete is modeled with smeared cracks. This model proved to be able to represent the behaviour of the shear-lap blocks quite adequately...|$|E
40|$|Block diagram {{languages}} {{provide an}} effective approach to developing Digital Signal Processing applications. The tools that <b>support</b> <b>block</b> diagram languages use existing compilation systems to produce code. The inefficiencies of the compilation systems are compounded with inefficiencies interfacing to them. Generation of intermediate code direct from the block diagram bypasses these inefficiencies. We describe the direct generation of F-code, {{a very high}} level intermediate language developed for data parallel applications. 1 Introduction Development of DSP applications is amenable to a graphical approach using a schematic editor to enter a block diagram, and to parameterise each block. Research tools such as Ptolemy [2] and commercial products such as COSSAP and SPW are based upon this approach. Executable code is generated by pasting together template code fragments for each block. An appropriate order for the fragments is determined by dataflow analysis [1]. Independent fr [...] ...|$|E
