40|$|There {{has been}} very little {{research}} done in logistics service on how its quality is defined and attributed. In this paper, we aim to explore {{the definition of the}} concept of quality in logistics service and its associated dimensions by constructing a conceptual model and test it empirically. A survey was conducted in Singapore with 2333 logistics service providers and customers from Singapore Logistics Association and Singapore&# 039;s National <b>Shipper</b> <b>Council.</b> A total of 171 questionnaires including 86 from logistics service providers and 85 customers were returned. After the process of exploratory factor analysis followed by confirmatory factor analysis, we found that the revised model of five factors and 20 items of logistics service quality (LSQ) is valid and reliable to measure the quality of logistics service. It was also indicated from the study that the quality of customer focus is deemed the most critical to enhance the perceived LSQ...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of counterproductive work behavior (CWB) does not only differ across industries but also varies significantly according to socio-demographic characteristics. This study examines CWB and socio-demographic characteristics among selected {{employees in the}} Nigerian maritime industry. Causal research design was adopted to survey 1, 000 employees selected through multistage sampling approach in three selected parastatals (Nigerian Ports Authority, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, and Nigerian <b>Shippers</b> <b>Council).</b> The data obtained were analyzed with ANOVA and t-test. Based on the analysis carried out, CWB {{was found to be}} significantly related to gender, age, marital status, employee cadre, and income, while employees’ level of educational attainment is not significantly related to CWB. Based on the abovementioned findings, the study concludes that the level of education is not significantly connected to the employees’ propensity towards CWB, while other socio-demographic variables are strongly associated to CWB in the workplace. The study recommends that management should develop a mechanism for identifying and selecting their potential employees as a guide against poor organizational fit of employees and that of the organization. Likewise, effort should be intensified to develop and improve organizational culture that will propel citizenship behavior in the workplace...|$|E
