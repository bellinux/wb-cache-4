25|$|Samarium iodide {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} ketones and {{aldehydes}} to alcohols; however, diastereoselectivity is low and a variety of more <b>stereoselective</b> methods exist. Aldehydes may be selectively reduced in the presence of ketones.|$|E
25|$|Titanocene {{equivalents}} {{react with}} alkenyl alkynes followed by carbonylation and hydrolysis to form bicyclic cyclopentadienones, {{related to the}} Pauson–Khand reaction). A similar reaction is the reductive cyclization of enones to form the corresponding alcohol in a <b>stereoselective</b> manner.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, U. R. Y. Venkateswarlu and {{co-workers}} have reported a <b>stereoselective</b> method to synthesize pectinolide H. Midland reduction and Sharpless dihydroxylation reaction {{are involved in}} generating the three chiral centers at C–4’, C–5 and C–1’.|$|E
25|$|The <b>stereoselective</b> {{formation}} of enolates has been rationalized with the Ireland model, although its validity is somewhat questionable. In most cases, {{it is not}} known which, if any, intermediates are monomeric or oligomeric in nature; nonetheless, the Ireland model remains a useful tool for understanding enolates.|$|E
25|$|In the syn-selective {{reaction}}s, both enolization methods {{give the}} Z enolate, as expected; however, the stereochemical {{outcome of the}} reaction {{is controlled by the}} methyl stereocenter, rather than the chirality of the oxazolidinone. The methods described allow the <b>stereoselective</b> assembly of polyketides, a class of natural products that often feature the aldol retron.|$|E
25|$|The alkene ligand {{in these}} cations is {{activated}} toward attack by nucleophiles, opening {{the way to}} a number of carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions. Nucleophilic additions usually occur at the more substituted carbon. This regiochemistry is attributed to the greater positive charge density at this position. The regiocontrol is often modest. The addition of the nucleophile is completely <b>stereoselective,</b> occurring anti to the Fp group.|$|E
25|$|Nordoxepin is {{a mixture}} of (E) and (Z) {{stereoisomers}} similarly to doxepin. Whereas pharmaceutical doxepin is supplied in an approximate 85:15 ratio mixture of (E)- and (Z)-stereoisomers and plasma concentrations of doxepin remain roughly the same as this ratio with treatment, plasma levels of the (E)- and (Z)-stereoisomers of nordoxepin, due to <b>stereoselective</b> metabolism of doxepin by cytochrome P450 enzymes, are approximately 1:1.|$|E
25|$|Reduction of alkynes is {{a useful}} method for the <b>stereoselective</b> {{synthesis}} of disubstituted alkenes. If the cis-alkene is desired, hydrogenation {{in the presence of}} Lindlar's catalyst (a heterogeneous catalyst that consists of palladium deposited on calcium carbonate and treated with various forms of lead) is commonly used, though hydroboration followed by hydrolysis provides an alternative approach. Reduction of the alkyne by sodium metal in liquid ammonia gives the trans-alkene.|$|E
25|$|Transition metal {{catalysis}} is {{also useful}} for the stereospecific reduction of alkenyl sulfones. In {{the presence of an}} excess of a Grignard reagent, a palladium(II) or nickel(II) catalyst, and a phosphorus or nitrogen ligand, alkenyl sulfones are converted to the corresponding alkenes stereospecifically in good yield. On the other hand, dissolving metal and metal amalgam reductions are not <b>stereoselective</b> in general. Palladium catalysis is generally superior to nickel catalysis, giving higher yields and stereoselectivities.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seminar}} {{paper on the}} total {{synthesis}} of (+)-monensin, Kishi and co-workers utilized the allylic strain to induce asymmetric induction in the hydroboration oxidation reaction. The reaction is regioselective and <b>stereoselective.</b> The regioselectivity of the reaction {{is due to the}} significant positive character developed at the tertiary carbon. The stereoselectivity of the reaction is due to the attack by the borane from the least hindered side to which is where the methyl group lies at.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of zopiclone {{in humans}} are <b>stereoselective.</b> After oral {{administration of the}} racemic mixture, Cmax (time to maximum plasma concentration), area under the plasma time-concentration curve (AUC) and terminal elimination half-life values are higher for the dextrorotatory enantiomers, owing to the slower total clearance and smaller volume of distribution (corrected by the bioavailability), compared with the levorotatory enantiomer. In urine, the concentrations of the dextrorotatory enantiomers of the N-demethyl and N-oxide metabolites are {{higher than those of}} the respective antipodes.|$|E
25|$|Knowing {{that the}} group {{containing}} the boron {{will be replaced by}} a hydroxyl group, {{it can be seen that}} the initial hydroboration step determines the regioselectivity. Hydroboration proceeds in an antimarkovnikov manner. The reaction sequence is also <b>stereoselective,</b> giving syn addition (on the same face of the alkene): the hydroboration is syn-selective and the oxidation replaces the boron with hydroxyl having the same geometric position. Thus 1-methylcyclopentene reacts with diborane predominantly to give trans-1-hydroxy-2-methylcyclpentane—the newly added H and OH are cis to each other.|$|E
25|$|Since such a {{large number}} of {{catalysts}} and reactions involve binding to electrophiles to stabilize the transition state, many bifunctional catalysts also present a Lewis-basic, hydrogen bond acceptor site. As a representative example, Deng and coworkers have developed a thiourea-amine catalyst capable of promoting <b>stereoselective</b> Michael reactions. In the proposed transition state, one of the thiourea N-H donors is coordinated to the Michael acceptor and will stabilize the negative charge buildup. The basic nitrogen lone pair acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor to coordinate the nucleophile, but in the transition state acts as a general base to promote the nucleophilic enolate addition.|$|E
25|$|When one is {{considering}} allylic strain, {{one needs to}} consider the possible conformers and the possible stereoelectronic demand of the reaction. For example, in the conformation of (Z)-4-methylpent-2-ene, the molecule isn't frozen in the favored conformer but rotates in the dihedral angle around 30° at <1kcal/mol cost. In <b>stereoselective</b> reactions, there are 2 effects of allylic strain on the reaction which is the sterics effect and the electronic effects. The sterics effect is where the largest group prefer to be the farthest from the alkene. The electronic effect is where the orbitals of the subsituents prefer to align anti or outside of the orbitals depending on the reaction.|$|E
25|$|Tin {{hydrides}} reduce α-keto and allylic sulfones. The {{mechanisms of}} these processes involve {{the addition of a}} tin-centered radical to the substrate followed by elimination of a sulfinyl radical, which abstracts a hydrogen from a molecule of tin hydride to propagate the radical chain. Protonation of the organotin intermediates thus formed (by sulfinic acid generated in situ) leads to reduced products. Addition of a stoichiometric amount of proton source allows the use of tin hydride in catalytic amounts. Although desulfonylations of allylic sulfones are site selective (providing only products of allylic transposition), they are not <b>stereoselective</b> and afford mixtures of double bond isomers. The mechanism of desulfonylation of α-keto sulfones is similar.|$|E
25|$|MDMA and {{metabolites}} {{are primarily}} excreted as conjugates, such as sulfates and glucuronides. MDMA is a chiral compound {{and has been}} almost exclusively administered as a racemate. However, the two enantiomers {{have been shown to}} exhibit different kinetics. The disposition of MDMA may also be <b>stereoselective,</b> with the S-enantiomer having a shorter elimination half-life and greater excretion than the R-enantiomer. Evidence suggests that the area under the blood plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) was two to four times higher for the (R)-enantiomer than the (S)-enantiomer after a 40mg oral dose in human volunteers. Likewise, the plasma half-life of (R)-MDMA was significantly longer than that of the (S)-enantiomer (5.8±2.2 hours vs 3.6±0.9 hours). However, because MDMA excretion and metabolism have nonlinear kinetics, the half-lives would be higher at more typical doses (100mg is sometimes considered a typical dose).|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} polysaccharides {{have been found}} in the {{extracellular}} and intracellular compartments of M. plumbeus including fucose, glucose, galactose and mannose. Glucuronic acid, a carbohydrate with a similar structure to glucose, is located specifically in the extracellular region of M. plumbeus. The monosaccharide glucosamine was found only in the intracellular regions of M. plumbeus. Mucor plumbeus has the ability to detoxify pentachlorophenol and has been used in the biotransformation of other products. Incubation of M. plumbeus with the natural product maalioxide produces three metabolites (1,7 and 9 β-hydroxymaalioxide). Mucor plumbeus activity towards camphorquinone is <b>stereoselective.</b> Extracts of Mucor plumbeus have shown acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibition activity. Mucor plumbeus is able to biocatalyze the hydroxylation of terpenes and steroids by cytochrome p450 enzymes in the presence of O and cofactor NADPH. Mucor plumbeus also transforms sesquiterpene into a series of 12 degradation products of 10,15-epoxidation. As well, squamulosone (aromadendr-1(10)-en-9-one) is biotransformed by M. plumbeus to yield an array of terpenes.|$|E
25|$|Hirama {{synthesized}} compactin {{and used}} one of the intermediates to follow a different path to get to lovastatin. The synthetic sequence {{is shown in the}} schemes below. The γ-lactone was synthesized using Yamada methodology starting with glutamic acid. Lactone opening was done using lithium methoxide in methanol and then silylation to give a separable mixture of the starting lactone and the silyl ether. The silyl ether on hydrogenolysis followed by Collins oxidation gave the aldehyde. <b>Stereoselective</b> preparation of (E,E)-diene was accomplished by addition of trans-crotyl phenyl sulfone anion, followed by quenching with Ac2O and subsequent reductive elimination of sulfone acetate. Condensation of this with lithium anion of dimethyl methylphosphonate gave compound 1. Compound 2 was synthesized as shown in the scheme in the synthetic procedure. Compounds 1 and 2 were then combined together using 1.3 eq sodium hydride in THF followed by reflux in chlorobenzene for 82 hr under nitrogen to get the enone 3.|$|E
25|$|The Schreiber {{team found}} that the NiCl2 and CrCl2 {{promoted}} addition of alkynyl iodide to aldehyde effectively. The reaction provides a 2:1 mixture of desired product and its isomer. However, the undesired isomer can be recycled to the desired epimer in three steps, including Swern oxidation and Corey’s asymmetric reduction. Pd catalyzed partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to establish the Z-configuration at C(8)–C(9). The pivaloyloxy group was then converted to a bromide for the final coupling. A <b>stereoselective</b> enolate alkylation between the allylic bromide with the lithium enolate derived from the second fragment provided a 3:1 mixture of isomers and completed the backbone assembly of (-)-discodermolide. During the final conversion, the NaBH4 reduction of ketone provided a separable 2.5:1 mixture of isomers. The Schreiber synthesis of (-)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 3.2% with a longest linear sequence of 24 steps and 36 total steps. In 1996, the Schreiber group published the total synthesis of natural discodermolide with similar synthetic strategy (4.3% overall yield, 36 steps, 24 steps longest linear sequence.|$|E
25|$|A study {{assessed}} the metabolism {{of a single}} 75mg oral dose of doxepin in healthy volunteers with genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 enzymes. In CYP2D6 extensive, intermediate, and poor metabolizers, the mean clearance rates of (E)-doxepin were 406, 247, and 127L/hour, respectively (~3-fold difference between extensive and poor). In addition, the bioavailability of (E)-doxepin was about 2-fold lower in extensive relative to poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, indicating a significant role of CYP2D6 in the first-pass metabolism of (E)-doxepin. The clearance of (E)-doxepin in CYP2C9 slow metabolizers was also significantly reduced at 238L/hour. CYP2C19 {{was involved in the}} metabolism of (Z)-doxepin, with clearance rates of 191L/hour in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers and 73L/hour in poor metabolizers (~2.5-fold difference). Area-under-the-curve (0–48hour) levels of nordoxepin were dependent on the genotype of CYP2D6 with median values of 1.28, 1.35, and 5.28nM•L/hour in CYP2D6 extensive, intermediate, and poor metabolizers, respectively (~4-fold difference between extensive and poor). Taken together, doxepin metabolism appears to be highly <b>stereoselective,</b> and CYP2D6 genotype has a major influence on the pharmacokinetics of (E)-doxepin. Moreover, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as well as patients taking potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (which can potentially convert a CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer into a poor metabolizer), may be at an increased risk for adverse effects of doxepin due to their slower clearance of the drug.|$|E
25|$|Many of Woodward's syntheses were {{described}} as spectacular by his colleagues and before he did them, it was thought by some {{that it would be}} impossible to create these substances in the lab. Woodward's syntheses were also described as having an element of art in them, and since then, synthetic chemists have always looked for elegance as well as utility in synthesis. His work also involved the exhaustive use of the then newly developed techniques of infrared spectroscopy and later, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Another important feature of Woodward's syntheses was their attention to stereochemistry or the particular configuration of molecules in three-dimensional space. Most natural products of medicinal importance are effective, for example as drugs, only when they possess a specific stereochemistry. This creates the demand for 'stereoselective synthesis', producing a compound with a defined stereochemistry. While today a typical synthetic route routinely involves such a procedure, Woodward was a pioneer in showing how, with exhaustive and rational planning, one could conduct reactions that were <b>stereoselective.</b> Many of his syntheses involved forcing a molecule into a certain configuration by installing rigid structural elements in it, another tactic that has become standard today. In this regard, especially his syntheses of reserpine and strychnine were landmarks.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the later}} {{half of the}} twentieth century, chemists began to develop methods of <b>stereoselective</b> {{catalysis}} and kinetic resolution whereby reactions could be directed to produce only one enantiomer rather than a racemic mixture. Early examples include <b>stereoselective</b> hydrogenations (e.g., as reported by William Knowles and Ryōji Noyori, and functional group modifications such as the asymmetric epoxidation of Barry Sharpless; for these specific [...] achievements, these workers were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001. Such reactions gave chemists a much wider choice of enantiomerically pure molecules to start from, where previously only natural starting materials could be used. Using techniques pioneered by Robert B. Woodward and new developments in synthetic methodology, chemists became more able to take simple molecules through to more complex molecules without unwanted racemisation, by understanding stereocontrol, allowing final target molecules to be synthesised pure enantiomers (i.e., without need for resolution).
