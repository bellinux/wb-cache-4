40|$|A small {{portable}} chamber for {{the recovery}} of anaerobic bacteria is described. This rigid chamber is constructed of clear acrylic with dimensions of 30 inches (ca. 76. 2 cm) wide, 18 inches (ca. 44. 7 cm) deep, and 18 inches (ca. 44. 7 cm) high. Conventional bacteriological techniques can be used inside the chamber to efficiently isolate strict anaerobic organisms. An adapter allows the attachment of a standard anaerobic jar {{to the outside of}} the chamber. The jar can be used to store reduced media. Once the jar is attached to the chamber and the media is removed to the interior of the chamber, the jar is available to receive inoculated media. The anaerobic jar can then be removed from the chamber, without contaminating the jar or chamber with oxygen, and be placed in a conventional 37 degreesC incubator. This chamber also allows the microbiologist to process cultures without wearing gloves as was necessary with previous anaerobic chambers. Air-tight latex rubber <b>sleeves</b> <b>seal</b> around the microbiologists arms and to the armport flange of the chamber to prevent the introduction of oxygen into the chamber. Anaerobic conditions are maintained by circulating a 80 % N 2, 10 % H 2, 10 % CO 2 gas mixture through alumina pellets coated with palladium. This study indicates that anaerobic conditions obtained in this chamber are sufficient for recovery of obligate anaerobes...|$|R
50|$|The mercury {{displacement}} switch uses a 'plunger' that dips {{into a pool}} of mercury, {{raising the}} level in the container to contact at least one electrode. This design is used in relays in industrial applications that need to switch high current loads frequently. These relays use electromagnetic coils to pull steel <b>sleeves</b> inside hermetically <b>sealed</b> containers.|$|R
5000|$|After grading, {{the comics}} {{are placed in}} an inner well - a <b>sealed</b> <b>sleeve</b> of Barex, a highly gas-impermeable plastic polymer. Then, the comics are sonically sealed in a hard plastic, {{tamper-evident}} holder. This process {{is often referred to}} in comics jargon as [...] "slabbing". A label is affixed at the top indicating the title, date, grade, page quality, and any notes, such as notable creators. Books which would be damaged by encapsulation are returned without this process.|$|R
5|$|The three {{cylinders}} of each bogie {{were cast}} in mono-block format, each surrounded by two annular inlet steam chests {{and a single}} large outlet steam chest. These had the added function of keeping the cylinder heated by hot steam to maintain the temperature and pressure of steam entering the cylinders. However, these castings were difficult to machine accurately. The steam-sealing arrangements needed for this system were also complex, {{with each of the}} six cylinders and valve <b>sleeves</b> requiring 24 <b>sealing</b> rings.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the column}} Comic Book Vitamins on the Project Fanboy website, Steven Sykora {{discussed}} preserving collections by submitting your comic books to the CGC, where comics are inspected for flaws, graded accordingly {{and placed in}} an inner well - a <b>sealed</b> <b>sleeve</b> of Barex, a highly gas-impermeable plastic polymer. Then, the comics are sealed {{through a combination of}} compression and ultrasonic vibration in a transparent, hard plastic capsule. This process is often referred to in slang as [...] "slabbing" [...] and there is debate as to whether this provides better protection for your comic books than an acid-free backing board and Mylar sleeve.|$|R
40|$|A {{subsurface}} sampler {{including a}} cylindrical casing with portholes {{to provide access}} below ground to sample potentially hazardous substances without contaminating investigative probes that are inserted into the interior cavity of the casing. The sampler has an inner <b>sleeve</b> that <b>seals</b> the portholes on the casing during the insertion operation. After the casing is inserted into the ground, the inner sleeve is rotated such that the windows on the sleeve and casing line up exposing the soil {{to a variety of}} investigative probes. A tab or wiper is attached to the inner sleeve to clear soil blocking the portholes in the casing and to cut through the 2 ̆ 2 smear 2 ̆ 2 zone immediately along side of the outer surface of the casing. Once the sampler casing is in the ground and portholes are open, a sampling probe is inserted into the interior cavity of the casing following a track or guide system. When soil characterization is complete, the portholes can be closed off by turning the inner sleeve and capping the casing for future analyses, or the interior cavity may be filled with grout. The sampler casing is not intended to be removed unless the area is excavated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRubber <b>sleeve</b> is <b>sealing</b> {{component}} of underground packers, the rubber will occur corrosion or failure under the acid medium environment, which causes gas leak {{and leads to}} the security problems of wellbore. In the paper, corrosion testing was carried out to AFLAS rubber using HTHP autoclave in the harsh environment with the pressure 60 MPa, temperature 175 °C, test period 7 days and the compositions of the gas phase are 20 vol% H 2 S, 5 vol% CO 2, 75 vol% CH 4. Comparing and analyzing the changes of properties in gas and liquid phase before and after testing, such as quality, volume, tensile properties, hardness, permanent deformation, etc. The experimental results show that AFLAS rubber in gas and liquid phase has no dissolution phenomenon; moreover, tensile properties were weakened, hardness decreased and permanent deformation increased. While bubbling of AFLAS rubber in gas phase was more serious than in liquid phase, the swelling was on the contrary. Although AFLAS rubber is a good kind of anti-acid medium rubber, its mechanical properties is weakened in harsh environment. Therefore, {{in order to improve}} the effective seal life of packers in corroded environment, the corrosion influence on packer rubber should be considered when it is designed and used in high sour gas fields...|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "cartridge seal" [...] is a {{prepackaged}} seal that {{is common}} in more complex applications and were originally designed for installation in equipment where a component type seal was difficult due to the equipment design. Examples of this are horizontally split and vertical pumps. In 1975 the A W Chesterton Company designed the first cartridge seal that fit pumps with varying stuffing box bore sizes and gland bolt patterns. To accomplish this the seal utilized internal centering of the stationary parts and slotted bolt holes. This [...] "generic" [...] cartridge seal could be manufactured in higher production quantities resulting in a cartridge seal {{that could be used}} in all applications and pumps types. Cassette seals, patent no. 6,685,191 introduced by Gold Seals, Inc., utilize a replaceable inner [...] "cassette" [...] mounted in the cartridge end plate or gland, while modular cartridge seal systems makes it possible to replace only the parts subject to wear, such as sliding faces, secondary seals and springs, while keeping the <b>seal's</b> hardware (gland, <b>sleeve,</b> bolts).Cartridge <b>seals</b> can suffer from clogging due to the bigger space occupied inside the stuffing box, leading to dense or charged fluids not moving enough to centrifugate the solid particles.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} process and rate of {{carbonation}} reaction of Class A wellbore cement exposed to CO 2 -saturated solution at confined conditions similar to those employed in geological storage of CO 2. The main goal was to investigate whether reaction improves or degrades the sealing/healing capacity of fractured Type A cement plugs. Batch reaction experiments were performed {{for up to three}} months, on both intact and fractured Class A Portland cement cylinders, at a constant confining pressure of 30 MPa, a temperature of 80 °C and a CO 2 pressure of 10 MPa. The experiments were carried out on water-saturated samples, exposing them to the supercritical CO 2 at one end. All samples were jacketed in <b>sleeves</b> to <b>seal</b> them from the high pressure confining medium. The results indicate that cement carbonation front advanced in time, leading to a densification of the material. Extrapolation of the reaction rates to 1 -year period indicates a carbonation depth of about 1. 38 mm, and about 7. 56 mm after 30 years of exposure to CO 2 -saturated solution. Thermogravimetric analyses, Scanning Electron Microscopy observations and permeability measurements indicate that carbonation of wellbore cement leads to a decrease of the porosity of the material on the reaction front and moreover, has the potential for healing pre-existent fractures and for improving the sealing properties of good-quality cement samples in time, at reservoir conditions...|$|R
5000|$|Labour Cost: During {{installation}} MI cable {{must not}} be bent repeatedly as this will cause work hardening and cracks in the cladding and cores. A minimum bend radius must be observed and the cable must be supported at regular intervals. The magnesium oxide insulation is hygroscopic so MICC cable must be protected from moisture until it has been terminated. Termination requires stripping back the copper cladding and attaching a compression gland fitting. Individual conductors are insulated with plastic <b>sleeves.</b> A <b>sealing</b> tape, insulating putty or an epoxy resin is then poured into the compression gland fitting to provide a watertight seal. If a termination is faulty due to workmanship or damage then the magnesium oxide will absorb moisture and lose its insulating properties. Depending on the size and number of conductors, a single termination can take between 1 and 2 hours of labour (an electrician {{should be able to}} make a termination in 10 to 15 minutes on up to 4 core smaller sizes). Installation of a three-conductor MI cable (size No. 10 AWG — about 5 square mm) takes about 65% more time than installation of a PVC-sheathed armoured cable of the same conductor size. Installation of MICC is therefore a costly task. Certain PTFE, silicone or other polymer-insulated cables have been substituted in applications which require similar properties in terms of flame spread, which use less labour to terminate. MICC is still used in applications which are particularly suited to its combination of properties.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} a developed computational model {{to study a}} stress-strain state of the assembly unit components of a medium-speed diesel engine of new generation, type CH 26. 5 / 31, which comprises a cylinder head, a sleeve, a gasket, a block, two mounting studs and four power studs. The developed three-dimensional finite element model {{presented in this article}} allows us to take into consideration all the components that make up a gas joint, regardless of their geometric complexity. Its use enables us to estimate the cylinder head - gasket - <b>sleeve</b> tightness of <b>sealing</b> when applying the mounting, temperature, and gas loads, to define the stress and strain components of parts, as well as to study the gasket condition, including pressure distribution across its surface. Based on the results obtained in the study the finite element model of the cylinder head was modified considering a more detailed description of its geometry, thus reducing the principal tensile stresses. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Muzzleloader {{hunting is}} {{becoming}} a popular way of hunting {{with the introduction of}} many new muzzleloaders that use more practical techniques of reloading shots and appeal to a more broad range of hunters. Most states require that the muzzleloader be a [...]45 caliber or larger, with [...]50 caliber being a very popular caliber by means of availability. Muzzleloader hunting has broken itself down into two categories with the use of traditional muzzleloaders and the use of modern muzzleloaders. Traditional involves the use of open sighted rifles, probably {{with the use of a}} side locking mechanism that either hammers a cap to ignite the charge or a sparking mechanism known as a flint-lock that sparks and ignites the charge inside the barrel. Ammunition among traditionalists include whole lead shot which may be a ball but bullet shapes have become popular for their accuracy. Powder is measured and poured when doing traditional hunting. Modern muzzleloaders have become advanced in that they are able to perform well alongside some cartridge rifles. CNC machining allows for more accurate barrels. Magnified scopes are normally seen mounted if the state the hunter is in allows the use of scopes on muzzleloaders. Another recent change is that some hunters now use high-pressure smokeless powder in specially-built muzzleloaders instead of low-pressure black powder, requiring less powder to be used and getting a more powerful and accurate shot. Available ammunition now includes saboted rounds consisting of a small-diameter bullet surrounded by a large-diameter sabot which drops away from the bullet as it exits the muzzle. Saboted rounds are usually a copper-jacketed bullet (much like what is used to load cartridge ammunition) encased with a plastic <b>sleeve</b> that <b>seals</b> the barrel for a more powerful and consistent shot than traditional muzzleloader ammunition.|$|R
40|$|A paper {{describes}} the Sample Caching Subsystem (SCS), {{a method for}} storing planetary core and soil samples in a container that seals the samples away from the environment to protect {{the integrity of the}} samples and any organics they might contain. This process places samples in individual <b>sleeves</b> that are <b>sealed</b> within a container for use by either the current mission or by following missions. A sample container is stored with its sleeves partially inserted. When a sample is ready to be contained, a transfer arm rotates over and grasps a sleeve, pulls it out of the container from below, rotates over and inserts the sleeve into a funnel where it is passively locked into place and then released from the arm. An external sampling tool deposits the sample into the sleeve, which is aligned with the tool via passive compliance of the funnel. After the sampling tool leaves the funnel, the arm retrieves the sleeve and inserts it all the way into the sample container. This action engages the seal. Full containers can be left behind for pick-up by subsequent science missions, and container dimensions are compatible for placement in a Mars Ascent Vehicle for later return to Earth...|$|R
40|$|Damping seals, damping bearings, and {{a support}} sleeve are {{presented}} {{for the ball}} bearings of a high speed rotor. The ball bearings consist of a duplex set having the outer races packaged tightly within the sleeve while the sleeve provides a gap with a support member so that the bearings may float with the sleeve. The sleeve has a web extending radially between the pair of outer races and acts in conjunction {{with one or more}} springs to apply an axial preload to the outer races. The sleeves have a series of slits which provide the sleeve with a spring-like quality so that the spring acts to center the rotor upon which the bearings are mounted during start up and shut down. A damping seal or a damping bearing may be used in conjunction with the ball bearings and supporting <b>sleeve,</b> the damping <b>seal</b> and damping bearing having rotor portions including rigid outer surfaces mounted within the bore of a stator portion having triangular shaped pockets on the surface facing the rotor. Axial gates are provided between adjacent pockets in sections of the stator permitting fluid to flow with less resistance axially relative to the flow of fluids circumferentially between the rotor and the stator...|$|R
5000|$|In certain {{advanced}} laparoscopic procedures, {{where the}} size of the specimen being removed would be too large to pull out through a trocar site (as would be done with a gallbladder), an incision larger than 10 mm must be made. The most common of these procedures are removal of {{all or part of the}} colon (colectomy), or removal of the kidney (nephrectomy). Some surgeons perform these procedures completely laparoscopically, making the larger incision toward the end of the procedure for specimen removal, or, in the case of a colectomy, to also prepare the remaining healthy bowel to be reconnected (create an anastomosis). Many other surgeons feel that since they will have to make a larger incision for specimen removal anyway, they might as well use this incision to have their hand in the operative field during the procedure to aid as a retractor, dissector, and to be able to feel differing tissue densities (palpate), as they would in open surgery. This technique is called hand-assist laparoscopy. Since they will still be working with scopes and other laparoscopic instruments, CO2 will have to be maintained in the patient's abdomen, so a device known as a hand access port (a <b>sleeve</b> with a <b>seal</b> that allows passage of the hand) must be used. Surgeons who choose this hand-assist technique feel it reduces operative time significantly versus the straight laparoscopic approach. It also gives them more options in dealing with unexpected adverse events (e.g. uncontrolled bleeding) that may otherwise require creating a much larger incision and converting to a fully open surgical procedure.|$|R
