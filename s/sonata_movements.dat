5000|$|The {{first version}} of the <b>Sonata</b> <b>movement,</b> {{completed}} around 1919 (although Ives stated in his [...] "Memos" [...] that it was actually [...] "finished" [...] in 1913), had many simplified passages, and omitted several passages that had been some of the [...] "Centrifugal Cadenzas" [...] of the Concerto (this version was published in 1921). These cadenza passages became [...] "Studies" [...] for piano. The passages that were retained in the <b>Sonata</b> <b>movement</b> that had been simplified were restored to their original state in the [...] "Four Transcriptions from 'Emerson'" [...] that were assembled between 1915 and ca. 1923. When Ives recorded the Transcriptions in the 1930s, he restored most of these cadenza passages to the Transcriptions, and one photostat copy of the Transcriptions ("Copy C") shows how {{they were to be}} reinstated in writing (cf. the CD [...] "Ives Plays Ives" [...] for his recordings). Most of the more complex original text passages of the <b>Sonata</b> <b>movement</b> were restored to the Sonata in its second edition, in the 1940s.

50|$|Berg first studied under Arnold Schoenberg in {{the autumn}} of 1904, taking lessons in harmony and counterpoint. Later, in autumn 1907, he {{returned}} to begin studies in composition, which ended with the study of <b>sonata</b> <b>movements.</b> Several draft sketches of <b>sonata</b> <b>movements</b> date from this period and it is thought that Op. 1 followed from these drafts. The exact date of composition is unknown; although the second reissue of the score bears the date 1908, sources suggest that the Sonata was not composed until the spring or summer of 1909 (Scheideler, 2006). The premiere of the Piano Sonata, Op. 1 was given in Vienna on 24 April 1911 by Etta Werndorff. Other works by Berg and Anton Webern were also played at that concert. Pianist Léo-Pol Morin notably performed the work for its Parisian premiere in 1922.|$|E
5000|$|Ludwig van Beethoven wrote {{a number}} of <b>sonata</b> <b>movements</b> during the earlier part of his career with three-key expositions. For the [...] "third" [...] (that is, the intermediate) key, Beethoven made various choices: the {{dominant}} minor (Piano Sonata No. 2, Op. 2 no. 2; String Quartet No. 5, Op. 18 no. 5), the supertonic minor (Piano Sonata No. 3, Op. 2 no. 3), and the relative minor (Piano Sonata No. 7, Op. 10 no. 3). Later, Beethoven used the supertonic major (Piano Sonata No. 9, Op. 14 no. 1, Piano Sonata No. 11, Op. 22), which is only a mild sort of three-key exposition, since the supertonic major is the dominant of the dominant, and commonly arises in any event {{as part of the}} modulation. As he entered his so-called [...] "middle period," [...] Beethoven abandoned the three-key exposition. This was part of a general change in the composer's work in which he moved closer to the older practice of Haydn, writing less discursive and more closely organized <b>sonata</b> <b>movements.</b>|$|E

50|$|When {{communicating}} {{with his father}} Leopold, Mozart stated that this movement was to be played with fire. The movement is in sonata form with a short development section. The exposition begins with a fake slow-introduction with all instruments in unison, until {{the rhythm of the}} 4th bar reveals the quick tempo of the movement. The second subject is similar in melodic material and rhythm to the first subject, recalling the monothematic <b>sonata</b> <b>movements</b> of Haydn (e.g. Symphony No. 104).|$|E
50|$|Mozart, as a child, made {{arrangements}} for keyboard and orchestra of four sonatas by now little-known composers. Then he arranged three <b>sonata</b> <b>movements</b> by Johann Christian Bach. By {{the time he}} was twenty, Mozart was able to write concerto ritornelli that gave the orchestra admirable opportunity for asserting its character in an exposition with some five or six sharply contrasted themes, before the soloist enters to elaborate on the material. Of his 27 piano concertos, the last 22 are highly appreciated.|$|E
50|$|The key of {{the second}} subject may be {{something}} other than the dominant (for a major-mode <b>sonata</b> <b>movement)</b> or relative major (for a minor-key movement). A second option for minor-mode <b>sonata</b> form <b>movements</b> was to modulate to the minor dominant; this option, however, robs the sonata structure of the space of relief and comfort that a major-mode second theme would bring, and was therefore used primarily for a bleak, grim effect, as Beethoven did with some frequency.|$|R

When Ives added the line back to the <b>Sonata</b> <b>movement</b> (in the copy of the Transcriptions made by copyist Reiss), in both pencil sketch and ink patch, he simply called it [...] "viola part". Ives never intended it to be played by a viola. This {{is not the same as}} the optional flute part in the [...] "Thoreau" [...] movement, where a flute player is explicitly called for.|$|R

50|$|The first movement, allegro animato, {{composed}} between 1964 and {{the summer}} of 1966, is written in expanded sonata form with the first subject displayed by the solo piano {{at the beginning of}} the movement and the second subject distinguished by a prominent flute part. Several cadenzas of coloratura style, which Liszt also loved in his compositions, are inserted in the music. In contrast to the longer exposition compared to general <b>sonata</b> <b>movements,</b> the recapitulation is placed within. rather than after, the development.|$|E
50|$|As {{the result}} of these innovations, works became more sectional. Composers such as Liszt and Anton Bruckner even began to include {{explicit}} pauses in works between sections. The length of <b>sonata</b> <b>movements</b> grew starting in the 1830s. Franz Lachner's Prize Symphony, a work seldom played today, had a first movement longer than any symphonic first movement by Beethoven. The length of whole works also increased correspondingly. Tone poems, which were often in sonata form, greatly extended their length in comparison to traditional overtures. For instance, Berlioz's Waverley Overture is as long as some middle-period Haydn symphonies.|$|E
50|$|Concertos Nos 1-4 (K. 37, 39, 40 and 41) are orchestral and {{keyboard}} {{arrangements of}} <b>sonata</b> <b>movements</b> by other composers. The next three concertos (K. 107/1, 2 and 3), {{which are not}} numbered, are arrangements of piano sonatas by J. C. Bach (Op 5. No. 2 in D major; Opus 5. No. 3 in G Major and Opus 5. No. 4 in E flat major, all composed by 1766). Based on handwriting analysis of the autographs they are believed to date from 1771-72. Concerto No. 5 (1773) K. 175 was his first real effort in the genre, and one that proved popular at the time. Concerto No. 6, K. 238 in B flat Major from 1776 is the first Mozart concerto proper to introduce new thematic material in the piano's first solo section. Concerto No. 7 for three pianos (K. 242) and Concerto No. 8 (K. 246) also date from 1776 and are generally not regarded as demonstrating much of an advance, although No. 7 is quite well known.|$|E

5000|$|Franz Schubert, {{who liked}} discursive forms for the {{entirety}} of his short career, also employed the three-key expositions in many of his <b>sonata</b> <b>movements.</b> A famous example is the first movement of the Death and the Maiden Quartet in D minor, in which the exposition moves to F major and then A minor (translated to D major and minor respectively in the recapitulation), a formula that is repeated in the final movement; another is the Violin Sonata in A major (in which the second theme appears in G major and B major, while only the closing passage of the exposition is in the dominant, E major). His B major piano sonata, D 575, even uses a four-key exposition (B major, G major, E major, F-sharp major): this key scheme is literally transposed up a fourth for the recapitulation. The finale of his sixth symphony (D 589) is an even more extreme case: its exposition passes from C major to G major by way of A-flat major, F major, A major, and E-flat major, making a six-key exposition.|$|E

The y are more experimental, and their textures and rhythms are more rugged and more varied. The piano sonata in E-flat major, Hob. XVI: 52 is one of the most imposing and virtuosic of all of his sonatas. Haydn was in London on his second and last sojourn there when he composed this work for his pupil Therese Jansen Bartolozzi.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an analysis}} {{of two of the}} six sonatas for organ using rhetorical-musical prescriptions from seventeenth and eighteenth-century German theorists. It undertakes to examine the way in which lines are built by application of figurae, to observe the design of each of the six movements, and to draw conclusions concerning implications for performance based upon the use of figurae in specific contexts. The period source on melodic design and the ordering of an entire movement based upon principles of rhetoric is Johann Mattheson's Per volkommene Capelmeister (1739). Guidelines for categorization of figures derive from the twentieth-century writers Timothy Albrecht, George Buelow, Lena Jacobson, and Peter Williams. Chapter I provides justification for the rhetorical approach through {{a brief description of the}} rise of the process as applied to composition during the Baroque period by relating Bach's own familiarity with the terminology and processes of rhetorical prescription, and by describing the implications for performance in observing the sonatas from the rhetorical viewpoint. Chapter II deals with the process of composition by rhetorical prescription in (1) the invention of the subject and its figural decoration and (2) the elaboration of the subject through the sixpart discourse of an entire movement. Specific figures of decoration are defined through examples of their use within the context of the sonatas. Chapter III constitutes the analysis of the six <b>sonata</b> <b>movements.</b> Chapter IV reinforces the justification of this type of analysis. The figures, as aids for inflection and punctuation, affect decisions concerning articulation of events and assist in effecting convincing performance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Did Ludwig van Beethoven (1770 – 1827) re-use {{material}} when composing his piano sonatas? What repeated {{patterns are}} distinctive of Beethoven’s piano sonatas compared, say, {{to those of}} Frédéric Chopin (1810 – 1849) ? Traditionally, in preparation for essays {{on topics such as}} these, music analysts have undertaken inter-opus pattern discovery—informally or systematically—which is the task of identifying two or more related note collections (or phenomena derived from those collections, such as chord sequences) that occur in at least two different movements or pieces of music. More recently, computational methods have emerged for tackling the inter-opus pattern discovery task, but often they make simplifying and problematic assumptions about the nature of music. Thus a gulf exists between the flexibility music analysts employ when considering two note collections to be related, and what algorithmic methods can achieve. By unifying contributions from the two main approaches to computational pattern discovery—viewpoints and the geometric method—via the technique of symbolic fingerprinting, the current chapter seeks to reduce this gulf. Results from six experiments are summarized that investigate questions related to borrowing, resemblance, and distinctiveness across 21 Beethoven piano <b>sonata</b> <b>movements.</b> Among these results, we found 2 – 3 bars of material that occurred across two sonatas, an andante theme that appears varied in an imitative minuet, patterns with leaps that are distinctive of Beethoven compared to Chopin, and two potentially new examples of what Meyer and Gjerdingen call schemata. The chapter does not solve the problem of inter-opus pattern discovery, but it can act as a platform for research that will further reduce the gap between what music informaticians do, and what musicologists find interesting...|$|E
40|$|Schubert's {{treatment}} of the medial caesura differs on many levels {{from that of the}} Classical tradition. He problematizes many of its norms, introducing complications to the course of his <b>sonata</b> <b>movements.</b> Much research has been devoted to Schubert's approach to sonata form, his large-scale formal deformations as well as his innovative harmonic language. However, few of these writings have discussed the importance of the medial caesura to his sonata forms. Through the lens of Sonata Theory, this dissertation examines Schubert's handling of the MC, demonstrating how the complications derived from his unorthodox practice modify the structural and rhetorical layout of his pieces. I investigate Schubert's approach to three stages surrounding the MC articulation, TR and the energy-gaining process, the MC point of articulation, and the S-theme, discussing specific formal and rhetorical complications that arise from each of them. In chapter 1, I reconsider Schubert's MC practice from a dialogical perspective, demonstrating how some non-normative procedures (in Classical terms) became the norm within his own style. In chapter 2, I examine the impact of two common Schubertian procedures on the function, perception, and meaning of the MC: tonally over-determined TRs and the early arrival of the secondary key within TR. Finally, in chapter 3, I demonstrate how Schubert broadened the available cadential arrangements within MC pairs in declined-MC situations, exploring the expressive potential of normative/non-normative dual oppositions. The conclusion shows that 1) Schubert's stylistic preferences radically expand many of the default procedures posited by Sonata Theory, inviting refinements of the theory; and 2) that the Schubertian MC may incorporate two structural roles beyond its most fundamental function as a formal articulator: clarification of the function of a formally ambiguous passage, which is often connected to cases of tonal over-determination or the early arrival of the secondary key; and introduction of tonal and formal complications into the work's trajectory, invoking some kind of "correction" or compensation...|$|E
