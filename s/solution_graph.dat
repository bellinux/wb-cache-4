MATERIALS AND METHODS: The approach is informed by cognitive theory, previous empirical work on expertise in diagnostic problem-solving, and our own prior work describing {{the development of}} expertise in pathology. The architecture incorporates aspects of cognitive tutoring system and knowledge-based system design {{within the framework of the}} unified problem-solving method description language component model. Based on the domain ontology, domain task ontology and case data, the abstract problem-solving methods of the expert model create a dynamic <b>solution</b> <b>graph.</b> Student interaction with the <b>solution</b> <b>graph</b> is filtered through an instructional layer, which is created by a second set of abstract problem-solving methods and pedagogic ontologies, in response to the current state of the student model.

40|$|We explore {{algorithmic}} {{aspects of}} two known combinatorial problems, Graph Colouring and Hamiltonian Cycle, by examining properties of their solution space. One can model {{the set of}} solutions of a combinatorial problem P by the <b>solution</b> <b>graph</b> R(P), where vertices are solutions of P {{and there is an}} edge between two vertices, when the two corresponding solutions satisfy an adjacency reconfiguration rule. For example, we can define the reconfiguration rule for graph colouring to be that two solutions are adjacent when they differ in colour in exactly one vertex. The exploration of the properties of the <b>solution</b> <b>graph</b> R(P) can give rise to interesting questions. The connectivity of R(P) is the most prominent question in this research area. This is reasonable, since the main motivation for modelling combinatorial solutions as a graph {{is to be able to}} transform one into the other in a stepwise fashion, by following paths between solutions in the graph. Connectivity questions can be made binary, that is expressed as decision problems which accept a 'yes' or 'no' answer. For example, given two specific solutions, is there a path between them? Is the graph of solutions R(P) connected? In this thesis, we first show that the diameter of the <b>solution</b> <b>graph</b> R_l(G) of vertex l-colourings of k-colourable chordal and chordal bipartite graphs G is O(n^ 2), where l > k and n is the number of vertices of G. Then, we formulate a decision problem on the connectivity of the graph colouring <b>solution</b> <b>graph,</b> where we allow extra colours to be used in order to enforce a path between two colourings with no path between them. We give some results for general instances and we also explore what kind of graphs pose a challenge to determine the complexity of the problem for general instances. Finally, we give a linear algorithm which decides whether there is a path between two solutions of the Hamiltonian Cycle Problem for graphs of maximum degree five, and thus providing insights towards the complexity classification of the decision problem...|$|E

40|$|The {{problems}} of Interval Sandwich (IS) and Intervalizing Colored Graphs (ICG) {{have received a}} lot of attention recently, due to their applicability to DNA physical mapping problems with ambiguous data. Most of the results obtained so far on the problems were hardness results. Here we study the problems under assumptions of sparseness, which hold in the biological context. We prove that both problems are polynomial when either (1) the input graph degree and the <b>solution</b> <b>graph</b> clique size are bounded, or (2) the <b>solution</b> <b>graph</b> degree is bounded. In particular, this implies that ICG is polynomial on bounded degree graphs for every fixed number of colors, in contrast with the recent result of Bodlaender and de Fluiter. 1 Introduction A graph is an interval graph if one can assign an interval on the real line to each vertex so that two vertices are adjacent if and only if their intervals have a nonempty intersection.

40|$|Abstract. T-functions were {{introduced}} by Klimov and Shamir {{in a series}} of papers during the last few years. They are of great interest for cryptography as they may provide some new building blocks which can be used to construct efficient and secure schemes, for example block ciphers, stream ciphers or hash functions. In the present paper, we define the narrowness of a T-function and study how this property affects the strength of a T-function as a cryptographic primitive. We define a new data strucure, called a <b>solution</b> <b>graph,</b> that enables solving systems of equations given by T-functions. The efficiency of the algorithms which we propose for solution graphs depends significantly on the narrowness of the involved T-functions. Thus the subclass of T-functions with small narrowness appears to be weak and should be avoided in cryptographic schemes. Furthermore, we present some extensions to the methods of using solution graphs, which make it possible to apply these algorithms also to more general systems of equations, which may appear, for example, in the cryptanalysis of hash functions.
