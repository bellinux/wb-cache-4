5000|$|Jobcentre Plus was an {{executive}} {{agency of the}} Department for Work and Pensions {{of the government of}} the United Kingdom between 2002 and 2011. [...] The functions of Jobcentre Plus are now provided directly through the Department for Work and Pensions. The agency provided services primarily to those attempting to find employment and to those requiring the issuing of a financial provision due to, in the first case lack of employment, of an allowance to assist with the living costs and expenditure intrinsic to the effort to achieve employment, or in all other cases the provision of <b>social-security</b> <b>benefit</b> {{as the result of a}} person without an income from employment due to illness-incapacity including drug addiction. The organisation acts from within the government's agenda for community and social welfare. Job vacancies advertised for employers within each of the public offices use a computer system called the Labour Market System (LMS). A new government website named Universal Jobmatch has recently been launched whereby jobseekers can search for employment and employers can upload and manage their own vacancies whilst searching for prospective employees.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{develops}} an OLG {{political economy}} model of social se-curity and migration. We assume a a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) social security system, which employs payroll {{taxes on the}} working young in order to finance a <b>social-security</b> <b>benefit</b> to the aged. Migration policy is endogenously determined by the conventional negative effect of migration on wages, and by strategic considerations. The current young would like to influence the old-young composition of next period voters through migration. The paper characterizes sub-game perfect Markov equilibria, for different patterns of fertility rates among native born and migrants. We demonstrate the political economy mechanism whereby migration strengthens {{the social security system}} in the pres-ence of ageing. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{compares the}} emerging attempts at social mobilisation among Travellers and {{people out of}} work claiming <b>social-security</b> <b>benefits</b> in Norway. This analysis is carried out against the backdrop of a discussion of social marginality, integration and citizenship. It traces how the organisations could promote fuller citizenship on the part of marginalized sections of the population, in spite of the obstacles they might face. dr. polit. dr. polit...|$|R
5000|$|Suggested {{legislative}} changes: That {{the legal}} system should {{have the ability to}} charge both girls and boys (implying underage persons) with indecent conduct. Additionally, if children are summonsed, their parents should be similarly compelled to attend court, and that courts should have the power (if the parent's behaviour was said to have [...] "conduced" [...] the child's offending) to order that parents pay fines and court costs and that parents give an assurance of the child's [...] "future good behaviour". (Other sanctions suggested by the Committee included suspending <b>social-security</b> <b>benefits</b> relating to the child.) ...|$|R
25|$|The Russian Civil War {{devastated the}} whole Russian Empire {{including}} Ukraine. It left over 1.5 million people dead {{and hundreds of}} thousands homeless in the former Russian Empire territory. Soviet Ukraine also faced the Russian famine of 1921 (primarily affecting the Russian Volga-Ural region). During the 1920s, under the Ukrainisation policy pursued by the national Communist leadership of Mykola Skrypnyk, Soviet leadership encouraged a national renaissance in the Ukrainian culture and language. Ukrainisation was part of the Soviet-wide policy of Korenisation (literally indigenisation). The Bolsheviks were also committed to universal health care, education and <b>social-security</b> <b>benefits,</b> as well as the right to work and housing. Women's rights were greatly increased through new laws. Most of these policies were sharply reversed by the early 1930s after Joseph Stalin became the de facto communist party leader.|$|R
40|$|<b>Social-security</b> {{retirement}} <b>benefits</b> {{distort the}} saving decisions {{of workers who}} are rational enough to save for their future. Since the implicit rate of return in an unfunded social-security program {{is less than the}} marginal product of capital, the resulting decline in saving causes a welfare loss. The present paper examines the conditions under which the welfare loss can be reduced by replacing the current universal social-security program with a means-tested program that pays benefits only to those individuals with little or no other retirement income or assets.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1970 s the {{proportion}} of the nonagricultural labor force self-employed in the United States ceased its downward trend and has been rising ever since. This study provides an analysis of the causes of this change. A general-equilibrium model of self- employment and wage employment is analyzed, and aggregate U. S. time- series data are used to test predictions derived from the model. The empirical analysis indicates that changes in technology, industrial structure, tax rates, and <b>social-security</b> retirement <b>benefits</b> have contributed to the reversal of the previous downward trend, which had persisted for over a century.

2500|$|Rise of anti-German sentiment: Citizen-level {{resistance}} to Germany's economic vision for Europe is strong in many EU member states [...] including Germany, and has considerably tarnished Germany's and Angela Merkel's image abroad. The 2003 labour-market deregulation in Germany cut jobless rates from 12% to 6% by forcing unemployed middle-class workers to accept precarious low-wage employment and forgo <b>social-security</b> and retirement <b>benefits.</b> 1.3 million Germans, 20% {{of the working}} population, are obliged to receive wage top-ups (denounced as hidden subsidies given to employers) to raise their earnings to the welfare minimum. Strong-arm tactics used by Germany and the EU-ECB-IMF troika have driven Greek & Cypriot governments to openly court Russia in defiance of Brussels. Italy, Spain and Malta have expressed opposition to Germany's quest for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).|$|R
