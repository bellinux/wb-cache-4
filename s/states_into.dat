5|$|Due {{to files}} {{recovered}} by Fisher in London (and made public by the president), the American public and Congress both believe that Iran is funding the Blacklist, and The United States and Iran are headed towards war. Looking for more solid proof of Iran's involvement, Fisher infiltrates Quds Force headquarters in Tehran(previously a U.S embassy). Inside, he discovers that Iran {{has nothing to}} do with the Blacklist, and that the files he recovered were planted by The Engineers in order to lure The United <b>States</b> <b>into</b> a war. Fisher narrowly escapes Tehran by using a Predator Drone to blow up the Iranian vehicles chasing him, causing an international incident.|$|E

However, with the entry of the United <b>States</b> <b>into</b> the war in December and the German failure in the Battle of Moscow, Hitler decided that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. Around this time, Eichmann was promoted to SS-Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel), the highest rank he achieved.|$|E

5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the electrical circuits of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in the United <b>States</b> <b>into</b> safer conventional explosives and fireproof casings for nuclear weapons.|$|E

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of 1913, Yorktown conducted local operations out of San Diego and San Francisco. In January 1914, though, the gunboat returned to Mexican waters and investigated local conditions at Ensenada between 3 and 6 January before moving, in subsequent months, to a succession of Mexican ports: Mazatlán, San Blas, Miramar, Topolobampo, and La Paz. Following an overhaul at Mare Island from 24 June to 2 September 1914, Yorktown served in Mexican waters again into June 1915. From that point until the entry of the United <b>States</b> <b>into</b> World War I in April 1917, Yorktown continued her routine of patrols off Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran ports with occasional repairs at Mare Island and maneuvers out of San Diego.|$|E

Newly conquered Ceylon formed part of the Madras Presidency between 1793 and 1798. The system of subsidiary alliances originated by Lord Wellesley as Governor-General of India (1798–1805) also brought many princely <b>states</b> <b>into</b> the area militarily subordinate to the Governor of Fort St George.
