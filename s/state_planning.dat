5|$|Born in Moscow on 27 September 1937, Pavlov {{graduated}} from the Moscow Finance Institute in 1958. He started his nomenklatura (bureaucratic) career as a government economist; he started working for as {{an official of the}} Ministry of Finance in 1959, and {{became a member of the}} Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1962. Early in his career he also worked for the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). Pavlov started working for the <b>State</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee in 1979, and became a member of the <b>State</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee's board in 1981. He held the office as head of the <b>State</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee's Finance Department, the department which oversaw all aspects of the country's planned economy. He served as First Deputy Minister of Finance in Boris Gostev's ministry from January to August 1986.|$|E
5|$|Following Stalin's {{death in}} March 1953, Kosygin was demoted, {{but as a}} staunch ally of Khrushchev, his career soon turned around. While never one of Khrushchev's protégés, Kosygin quickly moved up the party ladder. Kosygin became an {{official}} of the <b>State</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee in 1957, and was made a candidate member of the Politburo. He was promoted to the <b>State</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee chairmanship, and became Khrushchev's First Deputy Premier in 1960. As First Deputy Premier Kosygin travelled abroad, mostly on trade missions, to countries such as North Korea, India, Argentina and Italy, for instance. Later, {{in the aftermath of the}} Cuban Missile Crisis, Kosygin was the Soviet spokesman for improved relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. Kosygin regained his old seat in the Politburo at the 22nd Party Congress in 1961.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The <b>State</b> <b>Plan</b> Index is an {{evaluation}} instrument {{that uses a}} Likert scale to assess 60 indicators {{of the quality of}} <b>state</b> public health <b>plans.</b> The <b>State</b> <b>Plan</b> Index was needed to enable evaluation of plans that were developed using a variety of public health planning models. Methods Federal, state, and academic partners participated in developing and testing the instrument. The authors conducted a literature review, interviews with experts, and several rounds of formative evaluation to assess item inclusion, coverage, weighting, organization of items, and content validity. In two rounds of field testing, public health practitioners at the federal and state levels rated 10 <b>state</b> public health <b>plans</b> for obesity prevention. Results Field-test raters took an average of two hours to rate a plan and indicated that the <b>State</b> <b>Plan</b> Index was easy to use, comprehensive, and fair.  Mean Cronbach a for components of the <b>State</b> <b>Plan</b> Index was 0. 88 (median 0. 93). Component scores among the 10 plans rated ranged from 0. 2 to 4. 8, indicating that raters made distinctions in quality among the components and the plans they rated. Correlations between component scores and overall scores were statistically significant (P <. 001), except for one component. Conclusion Public health professionals at the federal and state levels found the <b>State</b> <b>Plan</b> Index to be a useful tool for evaluating public health plans that were developed by <b>states</b> using various <b>planning</b> approaches. After the field tests, state staff reported adapting the <b>State</b> <b>Plan</b> Index for use as a planning tool, {{an evaluation}} tool for local plans, and a self-assessment tool for drafts of <b>state</b> <b>plans.</b> In addition, the <b>State</b> <b>Plan</b> Index can be revised easily for use in other chronic disease areas...|$|R

Prices of products under guidance planning either are unified prices or floating prices set by the state or prices negotiated between buyers and suppliers. Production and distribution of products not included in the <b>state's</b> <b>plans</b> are regulated by market conditions.|$|R
5|$|In 1988, the <b>State</b> <b>Planning</b> Commission {{proposed}} {{defining a}} reservation for {{the extension of}} the Kwinana Freeway to the southern edge of Perth Metropolitan Region, north-east of Mandurah. The northern and southern sections of the route were predetermined by factors including existing and proposed developments, power transmission lines, the location of wetlands and the Serpentine River, and required setbacks from an explosives depot at Baldivis. A number of routes were investigated for the central section, between Mortimer Road and Stakehill Road. The EPA found all proposed routes acceptable, and that the preferred route minimised environmental impact.|$|E
5|$|Ryzhkov and Gorbachev {{continued}} {{their work on}} economic reform and in 1987 began drafting the Law on the State Enterprise, which restricted the authority of central planners. This would later come into effect and give workers an unrealistically high level of power.

5|$|Ryzhkov {{was born}} in the city of Dzerzhynsk, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1929. After graduating in the 1950s he started work in the 1970s and began his {{political}} career in local industry, working his way up through the hierarchy of Soviet industrial ministries. In 1979 Ryzhkov was appointed First Deputy Chairman of the <b>State</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee. Following Nikolai Tikhonov's resignation as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Ryzhkov was voted into office in his place. During his tenure, he supported Mikhail Gorbachev's 1980s reform of the Soviet economy.|$|E
40|$|The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) authorizes {{states to}} {{establish}} their own {{occupational safety and health}} plans and preempt standards established and enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

To address the need for an instrument to assess the quality of <b>state</b> <b>plans</b> designed to prevent and control chronic diseases, we created and tested the <b>State</b> <b>Plan</b> Index and used it to evaluate the quality of nine <b>state</b> <b>plans</b> aimed at preventing and reducing obesity. MethodsThe <b>State</b> <b>Plan</b> Index was developed {{under the auspices of the}} Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with public health experts in federal, state, and academic settings. The <b>State</b> <b>Plan</b> Index included 55 items related to plan quality arranged into nine components. Each item was rated on a Likert scale from 0 to 5, with 5 being the highest rating. Each plan also received a separate overall plan quality score using the same scale. Each <b>state</b> <b>plan</b> was evaluated by four or five raters using the <b>State</b> <b>Plan</b> Index. For each plan, the 55 items were averaged to calculate an item average score, and a subscore was calculated for each <b>State</b> <b>Plan</b> Index component. Finally, five states also self-rated their own plans (self score). ResultsThe mean item average score for all plans was 2. 4 out of 5. 0. The range of item average scores was 1. 0 to 3. 0. The component of the <b>State</b> <b>Plan</b> Index with the highest mean component score (3. 3) was Presentation of Epidemiologic Data on Disease Burden. The components with the lowest component scores were Resources for Plan Implementation (0. 7); Integration of Obesity Efforts with Other Chronic Disease Efforts (1. 7); and Program Evaluation (2. 0). Plan quality was rated higher when based on the single overall plan quality score assigned by raters. In addition, self scores were consistently and substantially higher than rater-assigned scores. ConclusionEvaluation of plans early in the life of programs can be used to strengthen existing programs and to guide programs newly engaged in chronic disease prevention planning. The CDC has used the <b>State</b> <b>Plan</b> Index evaluation results to guide technical assistance, plan training sessions, and enhance communication with <b>state</b> staff about <b>plan</b> content, quality, and public health approach.

5|$|After {{the power}} {{struggle}} triggered by Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev became the new leader. On 20 March 1959, Kosygin {{was appointed to}} the position of Chairman of the <b>State</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee (Gosplan), a post he would hold for little more than a year. Kosygin next became First Deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers. When Khrushchev was replaced in 1964, Kosygin and Leonid Brezhnev became Premier and First Secretary respectively. Kosygin, along with Brezhnev and Nikolai Podgorny, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, {{was a member of the}} newly established collective leadership. Kosygin became one of two major power players within the Soviet hierarchy, the other being Brezhnev, and was able to initiate the failed 1965 economic reform, usually referred to simply as the Kosygin reform. This reform, along with his more open stance on solving the Prague Spring (1968), made Kosygin one of the most liberal members of the top leadership.|$|E
5|$|Early {{proposals}} {{made by the}} National Capital Park and Planning Commission {{involved a}} route that followed US1 north to MD198, then east to Fort Meade, but lack of funding led to simpler plans to widen US 1 instead. During the 1930s, the New Deal programs promulgated by President Franklin Roosevelt led to a heightened awareness of the parkway proposals; a 1937 report by the Maryland <b>State</b> <b>Planning</b> Commission increased awareness further. Increasing accident levels on US 1 (which was {{called one of the}} deadliest roads in the world at the time) along with awareness of the need to mobilize national defense before World War II provided additional motivation for construction of the parkway.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} the party leadership had split into pro-Soviet, pro-Chinese and moderate factions. Under Hồ {{the party had}} followed a policy of neutrality between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China {{in the aftermath of}} the Sino–Soviet split. This policy continued until reunification. In the aftermath of the war, a power struggle began between Lê Duẩn's pro-Soviet and its rival pro-Chinese factions. Former rivals Lê Duẩn and Lê Đức Thọ formed a coalition and purged the pro-Chinese faction. Their first victims were Hoàng Văn Hoan and Chu Văn Tấn. While the Politburo made decisions through consensus, Lê Duẩn, through his post as General Secretary, was the most powerful figure and was able to increase his power via his alliance with Lê Đức Thọ, Trần Quốc Hoàn and Võ Nguyên Giáp. Together with Lê Đức Thọ, Lê Duẩn controlled personnel appointments in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the <b>State</b> <b>Planning</b> Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the General Political Directorate of the Vietnam People's Army (VPA), the General Logistics Department of the VPA and the Ministry of Transport.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} his stay in Dnipropetrovsk {{that he met}} Leonid Brezhnev, a future leader of the Soviet Union. Tikhonov joined the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) in 1940 {{and by the end}} of the decade, had secured a job as a plant director. As a director, Tikhonov was able to show off his {{organisational}} skills; under his leadership the plant became the first in the region to reopen a hospital, organising dining rooms and restoring social clubs for workers caught up in the aftermath of the Eastern Front. Tikhonov was quickly promoted, and started working for the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy in the 1950s. Between 1955 and 1960 Tikhonov became a Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy, a member (and later chairman) of the Scientific Council of the Council of Ministers, and finally, a deputy chairman of the <b>State</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee. At the 22nd Party Congress Tikhonov was elected to the Central Committee as a non-voting member. At the 23rd party congress in 1966, Tikhonov was elected a member of the Central Committee. Tikhonov was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labour award for his first time.|$|E
5|$|Morton soon {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a strong advocate for allowing free enterprise and business to take precedence over planning controls and government regulation. His time as Minister was marked by increasing strains on state infrastructure and his pro-development stance was largely attributed as an attempt to alleviate these problems. Despite this, Morton and his <b>State</b> <b>Planning</b> Authority were continuously criticised for not being totally accountable to the public, particularly as the pro-business Sydney Commissioners worked side-by-side with the Planning authority to increase developments in the Sydney CBD to their highest levels ever, embodied by the construction of the MLC Centre, the demolition of the Theatre Royal, Sydney and the Australia Hotel. Among the most controversial schemes planned by his government were also a massive freeway system that was planned to be driven through the hearts of historic inner-city suburbs including Glebe and Newtown and an equally ambitious scheme of 'slum clearance' that would have brought about the wholescale destruction of the historic areas of Woolloomooloo and The Rocks. This eventually culminated in the 1970s Green ban movement led by Unions Leader Jack Mundey, to protect the architectural heritage of Sydney.|$|E

5|$|Ryzhkov was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of the Gorbachev policy calling {{for an increase in}} {{the quantity and quality of}} goods planned for production during the period of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (19861990). To achieve these goals, the government pumped money into the machine-building sector but as time went by, Gorbachev increasingly diverged from his original stance. He now wanted to increase overall investment in nearly all industrial sectors; a move which Ryzhkov knew was a budgetary impossibility. However, Ryzhkov's economic policies were not much better as he continued to advocate an unreasonable increase in the production of consumer goods. Gorbachev and Ligachev's anti-alcohol campaign was opposed by Ryzhkov, who agreed with the <b>State</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee and the Ministry of Trade that such a drive would deprive from the state billions of rubles in income. Nevertheless, the campaign went ahead, losing the Soviet Government millions in revenues. Ryzhkov's opposition to the campaign was strengthened by his belief that both Gorbachev and Ligachev placed ideology before practical considerations, and he instead advocated an alternative long-term program rather than one designed to have immediate effect.|$|E
5|$|This later {{reform was}} presaged by a {{reform in the}} middle of the 1950s; the {{economic}} historian Jörg Roesler considers the NES in the 1960s as a continuation of this reform. The origin of the reform in the 1950s was a scientific study, commissioned by Rau's ministry in 1953, to assess the need for greater economic efficiency in the factories. The subsequent results from this study promised enhanced economic efficiency by shifting more responsibility from the National Planning Commission to the enterprises themselves. Thenceforward, already in spring 1954, Rau advocated such a planning reform, while planning boss Bruno Leuschner quite consistently opposed it. In August 1954, Rau's ministry sent a concept for such a reform to Leuschner's <b>State</b> <b>Planning</b> Commission. Eventually this reform got under way, after Ulbricht, perhaps under the influence of his new personal economic adviser Wolfgang Berger, had approved such a policy at the end of 1954 too. Subsequently, the reform accelerated until 1956. It found however its early end in the generally aggravated political atmosphere in 1957. Unrests in other Eastern Bloc countries during the previous year 1956, in particular in Hungary, had awoken the desire for more central control again. The subsequent unsatisfying economic development, however, during the following years eventually led in the 1960s to the concept of a new planning reform, the NES.|$|E
