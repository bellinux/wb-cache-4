5|$|Another {{cause of}} revulsion against Webster was her attempt to {{impersonate}} Thomas. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> perpetrate the impersonation for two weeks, implying that middle-class identity amounted {{to little more}} than cultivating the right demeanour and having the appropriate clothes and possessions, whether or not they had been earned. John Church, the publican whom Webster had attempted to implicate, was himself a former servant who had risen to lower middle-class status and earned a measure of prosperity and effective management of his pub. His commitment to bettering himself through hard work was in keeping with the ethic of the time. Webster, in contrast, had simply stolen her briefly-held middle-class identity.|$|E

Virginia had sustained ninety-seven indentations to her armor from the fire of Monitor and other ships. Neither ship had sustained any significant damage. In the opinion of Virginias commander Jones and her other officers, Monitor could have sunk their ship had she hit the vessel at the waterline.|$|E

Smith's The Galaxy Primes began serialization in March 1959. Asimov's first published story, [...] "Marooned off Vesta", had appeared in the March 1939 issue of Amazing, and Goldsmith reprinted it in March 1959 along with a sequel and Asimov's comments on the story.

500|$|Cunningham was {{replaced}} by Commander George Cockburn in the command of Speedy, which remained in the Mediterranean. His first duties were limited to carrying despatches and passengers between Toulon and Genoa, after which {{he was ordered to}} join Captain Sutherland of , who was commanding a squadron blockading Genoa. The small fleet was caught in winter storms and several ships were badly damaged, forcing Sutherland and his squadron to seek shelter in nearby ports and to make repairs, with the exception of Speedy, which remained on station. Sutherland put into Hyères Bay and reported the dispersal of his squadron to Lord Hood, also noting that nothing had been heard of Speedy since the gales. Once Diadem had been repaired Sutherland returned to Genoa, and was surprised to discover Speedy still there patrolling the port, not once having left her task. While single-handedly maintaining the blockade, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> capture several vessels. Sutherland ordered Speedy, which was by now running desperately short of water, to Hyères to refit. At the same time, Sutherland sent a complimentary report of Cockburn to Lord Hood. On 20January1794, Cockburn was rewarded with an acting commission as post-captain of the frigate , followed a month later by a permanent command of the frigate [...]|$|E

2500|$|On 8 October 2006, a {{woman in}} her thirties was seriously injured on the log boat ride [...] "Flumeride". At the second and final drop, a [...] slope, the woman {{apparently}} panicked, and tried to keep the log boat from travelling down the slope by holding onto the railings. She was ejected from the boat into the water and slid down the slope, where she was hit in the head by {{at least one of the}} two following log boats. Since <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> temporarily keep the log boat from dropping down the slope, the following two log boats passed the last safety gate, and couldn't be stopped from falling down the last slope where the woman was located. The event was witnessed by the staff who stopped the ride, but were unable to prevent two of the log boats from continuing. The woman, who was travelling together with her 11-year-old daughter and another woman, was taken to Sahlgrenska University Hospital, where she was reported to be in critical but stable condition. An investigation has been initiated by the authorities, and Liseberg has also initiated an internal inquiry. She eventually recovered fully.|$|E
