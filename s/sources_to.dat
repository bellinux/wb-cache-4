5|$|A {{study in}} 1971–72 found that {{although}} Cleveland's crime rate {{was significantly lower}} than other large urban areas, most Cleveland residents feared crime. In the 1980s, gang activity was on the rise, associated with crack cocaine.

5|$|Modern {{scholars}} thus generally {{attribute the}} numbers {{given in the}} ancient <b>sources</b> <b>to</b> the result of miscalculations or exaggerations {{on the part of}} the victors, or disinformation by the Persians in the run up to the war. The topic has been hotly debated but the modern consensus revolves around the figure of 300,000500,000. Nevertheless, whatever the real numbers were, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea, and also that much of the army died of starvation and disease, never returning to Asia.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo of America's Nintendo Entertainment System was {{the best}} selling console system and almost all video game {{developers}} and publishers wanted to contribute the video game library.

5|$|On {{the whole}} Australian {{commerce}} was expanded {{due to the}} war, although {{the cost of the}} war was quite considerable and the Australian government had to borrow considerably from overseas to fund the war effort. In terms of value, Australian exports rose almost 45 per cent, while the number of Australians employed in the manufacturing industry increased over 11 per cent. This was due in the most part to the reduced ability of traditional <b>sources</b> <b>to</b> continue supplying Australia with manufactured products, which out of necessity stimulated the development of the Australian manufacturing industry.|$|E

5|$|The Holy Bible is {{the third}} studio album by Welsh {{alternative}} rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released on 29 August 1994 by record label Epic.

The songs focus on themes relating to politics and human suffering. The Holy Bible was the band's last album released before Edwards' disappearance on 1 February 1995.|$|E
5|$|The bus tunnel was {{originally}} intended to be converted for use by light rail trains {{at some point in}} the future. Metro approved the addition of tracks to the bus tunnel in 1988, appropriating half of the $5 million used to install them during construction, the remainder coming from federal <b>sources.</b> <b>To</b> save $1.5 million in costs, Metro eliminated most of the rail's electrical insulation, a move that would later make them unusable for rail service.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of a neutral atmosphere implies that an ionosphere should exist, because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic electrons coming from the magnetosphere and by solar EUV radiation. However, {{the nature of the}} Ganymedian ionosphere is as controversial as the nature of the atmosphere. Some Galileo measurements found an elevated electron density near Ganymede, suggesting an ionosphere, whereas others failed to detect anything. The electron density near the surface is estimated by different <b>sources</b> <b>to</b> lie in the range 400–2,500cm−3. As of 2008, the parameters of the ionosphere of Ganymede are not well constrained.|$|E
30|$|The {{performance}} of the <b>source</b> <b>to</b> relay channel {{plays an important role}} in the overall {{performance of}} co-operative relay networks [4, 5]. It is pointed out in [3] that code extension techniques provide better performance than code puncturing in the <b>source</b> <b>to</b> relay channel. In code extension techniques, optimal codewords can be transmitted over the <b>source</b> <b>to</b> relay channel to get the best performance. In code puncturing techniques, only punctured codewords can be transmitted over the <b>source</b> <b>to</b> relay channel, which results in a certain performance loss. Therefore, we design the rate-compatible LDPC codes for relay networks based on the extension technique.|$|R

5|$|To {{identify}} the optimal {{spatial and temporal}} distribution of radiation sources within the applicators of the implanted tissue or cavity, the treatment planning software allows virtual radiation <b>sources</b> <b>to</b> be placed within the virtual patient. The software shows a graphical representation {{of the distribution of}} the irradiation. This serves as a guide for the brachytherapy team to refine the distribution of the sources and provide a treatment plan that is optimally tailored to the anatomy of each patient before actual delivery of the irradiation begins. This approach is sometimes called ‘dose-painting’.|$|E
5|$|When Obbink {{published}} the Brothers Poem, he attributed it to Sappho {{based on its}} metre, dialect (Aeolic), and references to Charaxos and Larichos, known from other <b>sources</b> <b>to</b> have been Sappho's brothers. It {{is possible that the}} text is an ancient forgery; though the Brothers Song was included in at least some Hellenistic editions of Sappho, a classical imitation of Sappho is still possible. Nonetheless, evidence provided by Herodotus indicates that Charaxos was mentioned in poems that were attributed to Sappho during the fifth century BC; it therefore is likely that the poem is at least authentically from archaic Lesbos.|$|E
5|$|A Greek {{force of}} {{approximately}} 7,000 men marched north {{to block the}} pass {{in the middle of}} 480 BC. The Persian army, alleged by the ancient <b>sources</b> <b>to</b> have numbered over one million, but today considered to have been much smaller (various figures are given by scholars, ranging between about 100,000 and 150,000), arrived at the pass in late August or early September. The vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days (including three of battle) before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous last stands. During two full days of battle, the small force led by Leonidas blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass. After the second day, a local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks by revealing that a small path led behind the Greek lines. Leonidas, aware that his force was being outflanked, dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, and 400 Thebans, fighting to the death.|$|E

5|$|A few {{hydroxyl}} megamasers, including Arp 220, {{have been}} observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), which allows <b>sources</b> <b>to</b> be studied at higher angular resolution. VLBI observations indicate that hydroxyl megamaser emission is composed of two components, one diffuse and one compact. The diffuse component displays gains of less than a factor of one and linewidths of order hundreds of kilometers per second. These characteristics {{are similar to those}} seen with single dish observations of hydroxyl megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. The compact components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds,high ratios of flux at 1667MHz to flux at 1665MHz, and linewidths are of order a few kilometers per second. These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the diffuse emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes of order one parsec that give rise to the compact emission. The hydroxyl masers observed in the Milky Way more closely resemble the compact hydroxyl megamaser components. There are, however, some regions of extended galactic maser emission from other molecules that resemble the diffuse component of hydroxyl megamasers.|$|E

5|$|Among Hindus, Shashthi {{is widely}} {{regarded}} the benefactor and protector of children and tutelary deity of every household. She is also worshipped as a bestower of children to the childless, and regarded as the foremost goddess for blessing children. One of the earliest scriptural <b>sources</b> <b>to</b> describe a ritual in her honour is the second century BCE composition Manava Grhya Sutra, appended to the Yajurveda (written between the 14th and 10th centuries BCE), which describes a ritual called Shashthi-kalpa. In the Shashthi-kalpa rite, which was described as performed on the sixth lunar day of every fortnight, Shashthi was invoked to provide sons, cattle, treasures, corn, and the fulfilment of wishes. Today, Shashthi continues to be worshipped on the sixth day {{of each of the}} twelve lunar months of the Hindu calendar, {{as well as on the}} sixth day after childbirth in the lying-in chamber where the birth has taken place. Shashthi is worshipped in a different form in each of these lunar months as the deities Chandan, Aranya, Kardama, Lunthana, Chapeti, Durga, Nadi, Mulaka, Anna, Sitala, Gorupini or Ashoka.|$|E
