The most probable angle in the angular distribution was found to be smaller than the angle of the magnetic field (measured from the surface normal) in fusion devices. Therefore, the sputtering yield, which calculated by using the angle of the magnetic field as an incident one, was overestimated. On the other hand, as the angle of the magnetic field increased, chemically eroded hydrocarbons were redeposited far from the released position after successive dissociation in the plasmas. Moreover, E � B drift became an important process for the redeposition distribution.

40|$|Hollow fiber sorbents are pseudo-monolithic separations {{materials}} {{created with}} fiber spinning technology using a polymer 'binder', impregnated with high loadings of sorbent 'fillers' [1]. To increase purified gas recovery during the sorption step {{and to ensure}} consistent sorption capacity over repeated cycles, a dense, thin polymer barrier layer on the fiber sorbents is needed to allow only thermal interactions between the sorbate loaded layer and the thermal regeneration fluid. This paper considers materials and methods to create delamination-free dual layer fiber sorbents, with a porous core and a barrier <b>sheath</b> <b>layer</b> formed using a simultaneous co-extrusion process. Low permeability polymers were screened for <b>sheath</b> <b>layer</b> creation, with the core layer comprising cellulose acetate polymer as binder and zeolite NaY as sorbent fillers. Appropriate core and <b>sheath</b> <b>layer</b> dope compositions were determined by the cloud-point method and rheology measurements. The morphology of the as-spun fibers was characterized in detail by SEM, EDX and gas permeation analysis. A simplified qualitative model is described to explain the observed fiber morphology. The effects of core, sheath spin dope and bore fluid compositions, spinning process parameters such as air-gap height, spin dope and coagulation bath temperatures, and elongation draw ratio are examined in detail. © 2012 Elsevier B.

Dual-layer hollow fibers are created via dry-jet, wet-quench spinning with an inner "active" core of cellulose acetate (porous binder) and zeolite NaY (69 wt% zeolite NaY) and an external <b>sheath</b> <b>layer</b> of pure cellulose acetate. The co-spun <b>sheath</b> <b>layer</b> reduces the surface porosity of the fiber and {{was used as a}} smooth coating surface for a poly(vinyl-alcohol) post-treatment, which reduced the gas permeance through the fiber sorbent by at least 7 orders of magnitude, essentially creating an impermeable <b>sheath</b> <b>layer.</b> The interstitial volume between the individual fibers was filled with a thermally-moderating paraffin wax. CO 2 breakthrough experiments on the hollow fiber sorbent modules with and without paraffin wax revealed that the "passively" cooled paraffin wax module had 12. 5 % longer breakthrough times than the "non-isothermal" module. The latent heat of fusion/melting of the wax offsets the released latent heat of sorption/desorption of the zeolites. One-hundred rapidly cycled pressure swing adsorption cycles were performed on the "passively" cooled hollow fiber sorbents using 25 vol% CO 2 / 75 vol% He (H 2 surrogate) at 60 °C and 113 psia, resulting in a product purity of 99. 2 % and a product recovery of 88. 1 % thus achieving process conditions and product quality comparable to conventional pellet processes. Isothermal and non-isothermal dynamic modeling of the hollow fiber sorbent module and a traditional packed bed using gPROMS® indicated that the fiber sorbents have sharper fronts (232 % sharper) and longer adsorbate breakthrough times (66 % longer), further confirming the applicability of the new fiber sorbent approach for H 2 purification. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

40|$|Researchers {{have been}} {{incorporated}} ceramics into porous membrane separators {{as a way}} to improve their mechanical, thermal and battery performances. However, the inclusion of preformed ceramics within the polymer membrane can require multiple additional steps. Current methods of ceramic particle inclusion in the polymer network can lead to issues of particle aggregation which can leads to non-uniform membrane performance. Ceramics present on the surface can delaminate from the surface, which would negatively affect the membrane performance. For this study, we aimed to incorporate room temperature curable liquid ceramic precursors into polymer networks to fabricate polymer/ceramic hybrids in a single electrospinning step. First, we combined polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and organopolysilazane (OPSZ) to successfully create polymer-ceramic membranes without the need for further post-treatment. We varied the amount of ceramic precursor added to investigate the effect of ceramic loading on membrane properties and its electrochemical performance. Results show that with increasing as the amount of ceramic, there is an improvement in the mechanical strength and thermal stability of the membranes. There is also an increase in ionic conductivity with increased ceramic inclusion as the presence of the ceramic disrupts the polymers ability to crystallize. The increased ionic conductivity correlated to an increase in battery performance and capacity retention especially at high charge/discharge rates. We note that all nanofiber based separators in the current study have the similar porosity around 80 %, and they exhibit a wide range of the rate iii capability performances due to their different internal and surface morphologies of nanofibers which in turn affect the ionic conductivity. We then used various organopolysilazanes with different ratios of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) pendant chain to polysilazane backbone to investigate the effect of ceramic structures on the membrane performance. Our results demonstrate that changing to the TEOS to polysilazane ratio can affect that the ceramics ability to form a continuous network within the polymer at the same concentration. The ability to form continuous network increases the amorphous regions within the polymer network, leading to an increase in the ionic conductivity which in turn leads to better battery performance. We note that using OPSZ shows an approximately 5 nm ceramic <b>sheath</b> <b>layer</b> forms on the fibers. In order to investigate the effect of this ceramic <b>sheath</b> <b>layer,</b> we incorporated various silica precursors which resulted in various polymer-ceramic morphologies, ranging from no sheath layer,partial sheath layers, and to full shear layer on the polymer/ceramic fibers. Our results reveal that the presence of ceramic <b>sheath</b> <b>layer</b> leads to better membrane-electrolyte interaction which caused the increase in electrolyte uptake and ionic uptake. Additionally, the ceramic on the <b>sheath</b> <b>layer</b> can aid in preventing the buildup of fluorine based particles on the surface on the fiber, leading to improved capacity retention. iv 2021 - 05 - 3...|$|E

Core spun yarn (also known as core-sheath yarn) begins with an inherently fire resistant fiber core (e.g., glass).

The thermally stable core maintains the structural integrity and provides a woven framework (grid) for the char layer (lattice) formed by the thermal decomposition of the sheath fiber. This type of “grid/lattice” structure ([[URL] 2999]) provides the physical barrier that prevents flame penetration into the more flammable cushioning layer as discussed earlier.

The role of T-cadherin in biology of the skin is poorly understood.

Methods: We conducted an immunohistochemical analysis of T-cadherin expression in the epidermis and adnexal structures of normal skin. Results: T-cadherin expression is restricted to basal keratinocytes of the epidermis. The basal cell layer of sebaceous glands was T-cadherin positive, whereas sebocytes were negative.

Due to the long duration of the GRB, the burst could be studied in hard X-rays with high-resolution focusing detectors (NuSTAR). The blackbody temperature, {{as measured by the}} Swift/XRT, shows a decreasing trend until the late phase (Piro et al.) whereas the high-energy data reveal a significant blackbody component during the late epochs at an order of magnitude higher temperature (~ 5 keV) compared to contemporaneous low energy data (Bellm et al.).

40|$|The {{effects of}} three {{configurations}} (aligned, staggered, and columnar) of submerged flexible vegetation on flow structure are investigated experimentally in the laboratory. Time-averaged flow velocity and turbulence behavior are evaluated at different positions in each configuration {{by using a}} 3 D acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV). According to the hydrodynamic regimes in experimental results, the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity can be separated into three layers the upper non-vegetated layer, middle vegetation layer, and lower <b>sheath</b> <b>layer.</b> This three-layer model, which is associated with different logarithmic equations, {{can be applied to}} describe the vertical distribution of streamwise velocity. The local maximum velocity within vegetation occurs at the sheath section of a plant clump (0. 10 - 0. 15 vegetation height (H(v)) where the frontal width is minimal. Turbulent intensities in the streamwise (u(rms)) and spanwise (v(rms)) directions peak at the sheath section and at the approximate top of the canopy (0. 9 - 1. 2 H(v)). The maximum Reynolds stresses exist at roughly 0. 9 - 1. 2 H(v), which may be migrated vertically as the frontal width of a plant clump is increased. This high frontal width also increases streamwise velocity above vegetation, leading to increase variations in Reynolds stresses around the canopy top. On the vertical turbulent velocity scale (w(rms)), the vortices above a still canopy rotate faster than those above a waving canopy. Therefore, the experimental results demonstrate that the flow field can vary significantly at the sheath section and {{at the top of a}} plant clump due to altered flow pass. These analytical findings will likely prove useful when designing ecological habitats and preventing riverbed erosion. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Gas-liquid chromatography showed that the polysaccharide was an approximately 1 : 1 mixture of uronic acids (glucuronic, galacturonic, and mannuronic acids and at least one other unidentified uronic acid) and an amino sugar (galactosamine). Neutral sugars were not detected. Amino acid analysis showed that sheath proteins were enriched in cysteine (6 mol%). The cysteine residues in the sheath proteins probably provide sulfhydryls for disulfide bonds that {{play an important role in}} maintaining the structural integrity of the sheath (D. Emerson and W. C. Ghiorse, J. Bacteriol. 175 : 7819 - 7827, 1993) ...|$|E
30|$|A {{uniform and}} {{conformal}} deposition of polypyrrole of a controlled thickness over ZnO nanorods {{is essential for}} the creation of PPy sheath and nanotube nanostructures. Polypyrrole has been deposited the past by various chemical [48] and potentiostatic electropolymerization [49] methods. In this work, PPy deposition is done by electropolymerization of pyrrole monomer in situ over ZnO nanorods using the ultrashort multiple unipolar pulsed-current method reported earlier [45]. Electropolymerization is accomplished in an electrolyte solution containing 0.01 M pyrrole (Py) monomer (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1 M lithium perchlorate dopant ions in the presence of 0.06 M sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant. The preparatory steps involve first the dissolution of pyrrole monomer in the presence of SDS under continuous stirring in deionized water warmed to 40 °C. Later, the ZnO-seed-layer-coated graphite substrate is dipped vertically for approximately 20 min in this solution which helps in the wettability of the ZnO nanorods with pyrrole monomer. Before initiating the electropolymerization process, lithium perchlorate is added to form 0.1 M solution. The formation of the polypyrrole <b>sheath</b> <b>layer</b> over ZnO nanorods is carried out by pulsed current electropolymerization method in a two-electrode cell using a platinum (Pt) sheet as a counter and a reference electrode. In this method, multiple unipolar anodic ultrashort 10 -ms-duration constant-current pulses of amplitude 4 mA.cm- 2 are applied. Each of the pulses is interspaced by a current ‘off’ period of 100 -ms duration. The electropolymerization is initiated during the pulse ‘on’ period as the corresponding anodic potential exceeds the oxidation potential of the pyrrole monomer. The current off period essentially helps create the equilibrium conditions in the vicinity of ZnO nanorods for deposition under homogenous polymerization conditions. The number of current pulses effectively controls the polypyrrole-layer thickness and usually approximately 5 to 10 k pulses were used to form fully covered PPy sheath over ZnO nanorods. In some cases 20 k pulses were also applied to form a thicker PPy sheath.|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} and histology {{are described}} {{for the entire}} male internal reproductive organs of the Mahoenui weta. These show many similarities to other Stenopelmatidae. Testes follicles of Mahoenui weta have the usual structure for Stenopelmatidae with basal sections surrounding {{the ends of the}} vasa efferentia. Epithelial cells of the vasa efferentia, vasa deferentia and seminal vesicle have similar basophilic cytoplasm. Muscle layers are best developed around the seminal vesicle and the accessory glands. The ejaculatory duct has a cuticular intima and is enclosed by a muscular sheath. The development of the external genitalia from the 8 th to the 10 th instar is followed and discussed. The morphology of the external reproductive genitalia is close in form to that of the Rhaphidophoridae. The morphology and histology of the entire female reproductive organs of the Mahoenui weta are described. The morphology and histology of female Mahoenui weta are very similar to those of other Orthoptera. The histology is particularly close to that of the Acrididae. Ovaries and ovarioles have the usual structure for Stenopelmatidae. The follicles are enclosed within a follicular epithelium and the ovarioles are enclosed within an outer ovariole <b>sheath</b> <b>layer</b> of connective tissue. The epithelial cells of the ovarioles and lateral oviducts have basophilic cytoplasm. The vagina is lined with a cuticular intima and is surrounded by a muscular sheath. The external genitalia are described from 8 th to 10 th instar Mahoenui weta and their probable functions are discussed. The behaviour of captive Mahoenui weta was observed, using infra-red time lapse video. Data were recorded from the months of December, January, February, March and July. Weta ate most often in January, March and July, and most mating activity occurred during January. Mahoenui weta were consistently most active at 60 - 80 % of total night-time and showed less activity closer to sunrise or sunset. Mating and moulting are discussed. Incubation time of Mahoenui weta eggs was recorded using eggs laid in a previous study (Richards 1994). The time of hatching and the behaviour of newly hatched nymphs was recorded over several days using video equipment. All eclosion occurred at night, with time of eclosion ranging from 8 pm to 3. 30 am over the three nights. Weta were free of the egg and walked within 17 minutes of the egg appearing on the soil surface. All hatched weta died within three days of eclosion. The external appearance and histology of eggs is described. Mahoenui weta eggs have many features in common with other Orthoptera. Mahoenui weta were exposed to 12 different plant species commonly fed to them in captivity, and present in the Mahoenui weta reserve. The weight of plant material eaten was recorded to determine which species of plant the weta preferred. Mahoenui weta showed the greatest preference for kowhai followed by gorse, broom, buttercup, tawa, karaka, coprosma, camellia, lemonwood, mahoe, houhere and hoheria. There was a marked preference for legume plant species over non-legumes...|$|E
