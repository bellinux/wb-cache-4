60|$|When sago {{is to be}} made, a full-grown tree is {{selected}} just before {{it is going to}} flower. It is cut down close to the ground, the leaves and leafstalks cleared away, and a broad strip of the bark taken off the upper side of the trunk. This exposes the pithy matter, which is of a rusty colour {{near the bottom of the}} tree, but higher up pure white, about as hard as a dry apple, but with woody fibre running through it about a quarter of an inch apart. This pith is cut or broken down into a coarse powder by means of a tool constructed for the purpose--a club of hard and heavy wood, having a piece of sharp quartz rock firmly imbedded into its blunt end, and projecting about half an inch. By successive blows of this, narrow strips of the pith are cut away, and fall down into the cylinder formed by the bark. Proceeding steadily on, the whole trunk is cleared out, leaving a skin not more than half an inch in thickness. This material is carried away (in baskets made of the sheathing bases of the leaves) to the nearest water, where a washing-machine is put up, which is composed almost entirely of the saga tree itself. The large sheathing bases of the leaves form the troughs, and the fibrous covering from the leaf-stalks of the young cocoa-nut the strainer. Water is poured on the mass of pith, which is kneaded and pressed against the strainer till the starch is all dissolved and has passed through, when the fibrous refuse is thrown away, and a fresh basketful put in its place. The water charged with <b>sago</b> <b>starch</b> passes on to a trough, with a depression in the centre, where the sediment is deposited, the surplus water trickling off by a shallow outlet. When the trough is nearly full, the mass of starch, which has a slight reddish tinge, is made into cylinders of about thirty pounds' weight, and neatly covered with sago leaves, and in this state is sold as raw sago.|$|E

The alkaline solutions use were solution of qi (traditional alkali) ash and of NaOH at pH 11 and the starches were of tapioca, aren (Arenga pinata) and sago. Effects, of type of alkaline solutions and different starches {{on the characteristics of}} gel were also studied. The optimum extraction time using qi ash 4 % was 70 min. When the extraction using NaOH at pH 11 was effected, it needed 60 min to get the extract which resulted the most stable gel.

Boiling the NaOH extract mixed with tapioca, aren, and <b>sago</b> <b>starches</b> needed 70, 40, and 50 min, respectively, to get the best result.

The highest breaking strength of the gel was produced when the fornulae comprising qi solution and aren was adopted. The gels made from qi extract boiled along with aren and <b>sago</b> <b>starches</b> gave more acceptable gels than that along with tapioca starch.
