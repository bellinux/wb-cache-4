50|$|Extension garter springs {{are on the}} {{opposite}} side of the spring spectrum. Although they are also a type of coiled <b>spring,</b> <b>extension</b> garter springs exert inward radial forces that move toward the center. Extension springs store potential energy in their extended form and want to contract. Thinner wire and a greater number of coils allow extension springs to be able to contract quickly, which is essential when dealing with pressurized fluids and gases. Extension garter springs act against forces from the center, so they may be placed on the outside of a circular object to maintain the object's circular shape. They act similar to a bracelet, which is extended to fit around the hand and then snaps back into shape on the wrist. Extension garter springs are more common than compression garter springs because they use less material (smaller circumference and thinner wire) and they respond to changes quicker and more efficiently.|$|E

40|$|Abstract ― Over 450, 000 Americans {{suffer from}} debilitative {{disorders}} {{resulting in the}} loss of proper hand function. A lightweight, non-cumbrous, orthotic hand exoskeleton was designed to restore normal pinching and grasping finger motions. Three functional digit mechanisms were designed: a thumb, index, and grouped third digit, comprised of the middle, ring, and small fingers. Each phalange was enclosed by a series of cylindrical aluminum bands connected at the centers of rotation of each joint. Bowden cables were mounted beneath each digit to provide active flexion, mimicking the tendons in the hand. A <b>spring</b> <b>extension</b> mechanism maintained constant tension in the Bowden cables, and during relaxation, returned the actuated digits to a fully extended resting position. Individually controlled actuators mounted on a forearm assembly produced 15 N of tensile force in each cable.

40|$|The Author(s) 2012. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Cargo transport by two molecular motors is studied by constructing a chemome-chanical network {{for the whole}} transport system and analyzing the cargo and motor tra-jectories generated by this network. The theoretical description starts from the different nucleotide states of a single motor supplemented by chemical and mechanical transitions between these states. As an instructive example, we focus on kinesin- 1, for which a de-tailed single-motor network has been developed previously. This network incorporates the chemical transitions arising from ATP hydrolysis on both motor heads. In addition, both the chemical and the mechanical transition rates of a single kinesin motor were found {{to depend on the}} load force experienced by the motor. When two such motors are attached via their stalks to a cargo particle, they become elastically coupled. This coupling can be effectively described by an elastic spring between the two motors. The <b>spring</b> <b>extension,</b> which is given by the deviation of the actual spring length from its rest length, determines the mutual in-teraction force between the motors and, thus, affects all chemical and mechanical transition rates of both motors. As a result, cargo transport by two motors leads to a combined chemo...|$|E
40|$|A weak {{spring is}} {{connected}} {{at one end}} to a rotor turning at constant angular velocity. The spring extends to a stretched length {{as determined by the}} spring mass, rest length, spring constant, rotor radius and rotor angular velocity. When released from the rotor, the inner end of the spring pulls away as expected, causing a wave to travel down the spring as it collapses. During this time interval, the outer end of the spring continues to move along its original circular path in uniform circular motion, as if the spring were still connected to the rotor. This is analogous to the effect of a hanging Slinky released from rest whose bottom end remains at a fixed position above the ground until a wave {{from the top of the}} Slinky reaches the bottom of the Slinky. Values from a numerical model and measurements from video analysis show that upon release the inner end travels along a circle of similar radius as the outer end. The effect appears as a series of alternating semi-circles. In addition, the simulation and data agree that (1) the <b>spring</b> <b>extension</b> and drag angle increase with the angular velocity of the rotor; (2) the droop angle decreases with angular velocity of the rotor; (3) the collapse time and bend angle of the collapsing spring are independent of the angular velocity.

50|$|Shot peening is {{a crucial}} process in spring making. Types of springs include leaf <b>springs,</b> <b>extension</b> <b>springs,</b> and {{compression}} springs. The most widely used application are for engine valve springs (compression springs) due to high cyclic fatigue. In an OEM valve spring application, the mechanical design combined with some shot peening ensures longevity. Automotive makers are shifting to more high performance higher stressed valve spring designs as engines evolve. In aftermarket high performance valve spring applications, the need for controlled and multi-step shot peening is a requirement to withstand extreme surface stresses that sometimes exceeds material specifications. The fatigue life of an extreme performance spring (NHRA, IHRA) can be as short as two passes on a 1/4 mile drag racing track before relaxation or failure occurs.|$|R

40|$|We use {{data from}} the National Incidence-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) to examine how the {{probability}} of getting caught when committing a crime, proxied by ambient daylight, impacts criminal activity. We exploit the existence of daylight saving time (DST) to provide within-hour exogenous shock to daylight, using both the discontinuous nature of DST {{as well as the}} 2007 extension of DST as sources of variation. Further, we consider both crimes where darkness is likely {{to play a role in}} avoiding capture and crimes where darkness would make little difference. Our preferred specification, a regression discontinuity design, shows robbery rates decrease by an average of 51 % during the hour of sunset following the shift to DST in the spring. We also find large drops in cases of reported murder (48 %) and rape (56 %). Effects are largest during the hour of sunset prior to DST (i. e., the hour which was in darkness before but, post-DST, is now light), suggesting changes are due to ambient light rather than other factors such as increased police presence, and we find no changes in crimes where ambient light is unlikely to be a factor. As an additional robustness check, we exploit the variation in the impact of DST by hour and crime to repeat our analysis in a triple-difference framework and show results are largely consistent. Using the social cost of crime, we estimate the 2007 <b>spring</b> <b>extension</b> of DST resulted in $ 558 million in avoided social cost...|$|E

(15 U. S. C. 260 a note) EPAct 2005 also called for the Department of Energy to evaluate the impact of Extended Daylight Saving Time on energy consumption in the United States and to submit a report to Congress. (15 U. S. C. 260 a note) This report presents the results of impacts of Extended Daylight Saving Time on the national energy consumption in the United States. The key findings are: (1) The total electricity savings of Extended Daylight Saving Time were about 1. 3 Tera Watt-hour (TWh). This corresponds to 0. 5 percent per each day of Extended Daylight Saving Time, or 0. 03 percent of electricity consumption over the year. In reference, the total 2007 electricity consumption in the United States was 3, 900 TWh. (2) In terms of national primary energy consumption, the electricity savings translate to a reduction of 17 Trillion Btu (TBtu) over the spring and fall Extended Daylight Saving Time periods, or roughly 0. 02 percent of total U. S. energy consumption during 2007 of 101, 000 TBtu. (3) During Extended Daylight Saving Time, electricity savings generally occurred over a three- to five-hour period in the evening with small increases in usage during the early-morning hours. On a daily percentage basis, electricity savings were slightly greater during the March (<b>spring)</b> <b>extension</b> of Extended Daylight Saving Time than the November (fall) extension. On a regional basis, some southern portions of the United States exhibited slightly smaller impacts of Extended Daylight Saving Time on energy savings compared to the northern regions, a result possibly due to a small, offsetting increase in household air conditioning usage. (4) Changes in national traffic volume and motor gasoline consumption for passenger vehicles in 2007 were determined to be statistically insignificant and therefore, could not be attributed to Extended Daylight Saving Time...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of an automated pre-production particle size distribution analyser for particles in the 20 - 2000 #mu#m size range. This work is follow up to the vibro-spring particle sizer reported by Shaeri. In its most basic form, the instrument comprises a horizontally held closed coil helical spring that is partly filled with the test powder and sinusoidally vibrated in the transverse direction. Particle size distribution data are obtained by stretching the spring to known lengths and measuring {{the mass of the}} powder discharged from the spring's coils. The size of the particles on the other hand is determined from the spring 'intercoil' distance. The instrument developed by Shaeri had limited use due to its inability to measure sample mass directly. For the device reported here, modifications are made to the original configurations to establish means of direct sample mass measurement. The feasibility of techniques for measuring the mass of powder retained within the spring are investigated in detail. Initially, the measurement of mass is executed in-situ from the vibration characteristics based on the spring's first harmonic resonant frequency. This method is often erratic and unreliable due to the particle-particle-spring wall interactions and the spring bending. An much more successful alternative is found from a more complicated arrangement in which the spring forms part of a stiff cantilever system pivoted along its main axis. Here, the sample mass is determined in the 'static mode' by monitoring the cantilever beam's deflection following the wanton termination of vibration. The system performance has been optimised through the variations of the mechanical design of the key components and the operating procedure as well as taking into account the effect of changes in the ambient temperature on the system's response. The thesis also {{describes the}} design and development of the ancillary mechanisms. These include the pneumatic feeding of the test powder into the spring, the non-interfering <b>spring</b> <b>extension</b> mechanism and means for measuring the cantilever deflection and hence the sample mass via a non-contact transducer. For an automated operation, a control software is developed which car allow an unattended analysis whilst providing particle size distribution in real-time. Data are reported in conjunction with a variety of powders with different size, density and shape. Typical resolutions in terms of size and mass measurement are better than #+-# 10 #mu#m and #+-# 0. 1 g respectively.
