It reviews <b>some</b> <b>representative</b> <b>work</b> in the area, with particular emphasis on the objectives, outputs and conclusions of the studies, and on how researchers propose using the resulting Risk Estimate for decision making. Several problems and sources of confusion concerning MRA are identified, such as terminology, the application of Risk Estimates to establish Food Safety Objectives and microbiological criteria for foods, lack of data, and the difference between Risk Assessment and the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point system (HACCP). In the context of Codex Alimentarius, MRA was developed as a tool for decision making and priority setting by government risk managers. However, elements of Risk Assessment can be used for other purposes. A transparent description of a Risk Assessment study is useful for Risk Communication.

In addition, the memristor can manage and store a great quantity of information. For its excellent properties about memory, we can build a new model if the conventional resistors are replaced by the memristors in neural networks, which is called memristive neural networks. <b>Some</b> <b>representative</b> <b>works</b> studied on {{the properties of the}} memristive systems display its applicability in several interdisciplinary areas (see Bao and Zeng 2013; Guo et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2003; Wu et al. 2012; Wu and Zeng 2012; Wen and Zeng 2012; Zhao et al. 2015). From the description of memristive neural networks, combining memristors with infinite memory is extremely interesting. An advantage of fractional-order systems in comparison to integer-order systems is that fractional-order systems can generate infinite memory. Therefore, merging the memristors into a class of fractional-order neural networks is pretty anticipated. Although stability analysis of fractional-order memristive or memristor-based neural networks has been gradually carried out (see Chen et al. 2014, 2015; Rakkiyappan et al. 2014, 2015 b; Velmurugan and Rakkiyappan 2016; Velmurugan et al. 2016), {{it is worth noting that}} fractional-order memristive neural networks can exhibit complicated dynamics or chaotic behaviors if the network’s parameters and time delays are appropriately specified.|$|E

Besides users' feedbacks (e. g., numerical ratings) on items as usually exploited by some typical recommendation algorithms, there are often some additional data such as users' social circles and other behaviors. Such auxiliary data are usually related to users' preferences on items behind the numerical ratings. Collaborative recommendation with auxiliary data (CRAD) aims to leverage such additional information so as to improve the personalization services, which have received much attention from both researchers and practitioners. Transfer learning (TL) is proposed to extract and transfer knowledge from some auxiliary data in order to assist the learning task on some target data. In this paper, we consider the CRAD problem from a transfer learning view, especially on how to achieve knowledge transfer from some auxiliary data. First, we give a formal definition of transfer learning for CRAD (TL-CRAD).

40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} study of a {{particular}} period (1884 - 1899) in Britain in which Fantastic literature revealed itself as a convergence point of multiple anxieties of late nineteenth-century society. Fantastic literature is a genre often mistaken for Gothic, Fantasy or the like, that in fact has its own particular' rhetoric and literary conventions. In this study I present {{some of the most}} important social and literary elements of the context in which Fantastic literature emerged in Britain - the conventions of Gothic literature, a short history of Spiritualism, the scientific organizations devoted to the study of paranormal phenomena, such as the Society for Psychical Research, and a brief summary of the social evolutionist ideas of Thomas Huxley and H. G. Wells. By examining the context and <b>some</b> <b>representative</b> <b>works</b> of Fantastic literature, like R. L. Stevenson's 'Olalla' (1884), Arthur Conan Doyle's 'The Parasite' (1895), Henry James's The Turn of the Screw (1898) and H. G. Wells's When the Sleeper Wakes (1899), we get a better idea of essential characteristics of Fantastic literature, that is, of the elements within these stories that reflect some important issues of late Victorian society. One can see that the rhetoric of the Fantastic sheds light on phenomena linked with uncertainty and fear in late nineteenth-century society, suchÃ‚Â·as occultism, supernatural sightings, haunted houses and spiritualism. During the twentieth and twenty-first centuries Fantastic literature has survived alongside Fantasy literature (J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings), magical realism (Salman Rushdie's Midnight Children or Garda Marquez's One Hundred Years ofSolitude) and children's literature (J. K. Rawling's Harry Potter) preserving its own identity and rhetoric. Italo Calvina's The Rampant Baron, J. L. Borges's 'The Aleph' and Haruki Murakami's The Wind-up Bird Chronicle indicate that Fantastic literature still has its place in literature because it expresses a particular kind of ideas that cannot find expression in other genres.

30|$|Multiple scan {{alignment}} {{without prior}} knowledge of the scanning viewpoints is a classic problem in 3 D modeling which have found several solutions in the computer vision literature [7]. <b>Some</b> <b>representative</b> <b>works</b> are [1 – 3, 7 – 9]. Being {{the first step of}} a modeling chain, its performance is of crucial importance for the attainment of the final object model, since a certain degree of accuracy is strongly required by the subsequent fine registration steps to converge to the correct solution. In fact it is well known that, for fine alignment, classic solutions (e.g. ICP [10] and its variants [11]) are based on optimization routines which often suffer from convergence to local minima which should be maximally reduced by proper initialization of each view referencing. Coarse alignment solutions {{can be traced back to}} one of the two main philosophies that have emerged during these years, i.e. with or without the exploitation of feature descriptors. The first approach exploits the ever-increasing computational capabilities of modern calculators to find, within a large solution space, the affine transform that better aligns two views. The main advantage of the techniques which fall into this category is that they are independent from the input data and are more robust to noisy data. On the other hand, they are usually computationally expensive. The progenitor of this family is considered to be the RANSAC, devised by Fischler and Bolles [12]. During the years, improvements to this algorithm have been proposed in order to reduce the computation time, also by exploiting point neighborhood descriptors [13, 14]. A second approach for coarse registration relied on the extraction and subsequent matching of (global, local or multiscale) shape descriptors [7, 15]. Advantages with respect to brute-force approaches are mainly related to the computational gain achieved through an accurate selection and skim of descriptive features. On the other hand, they usually fail in describing featureless surfaces, and are more sensitive to noise. Feature-based approaches are widely used in several application fields such as similarity search, object retrieval and categorization [16 – 18], shape correspondence and analysis [5, 15]. Multiscale feature-based approaches (such as the one we propose in this work) allow a better adaptation to features of different kind and dimension. Related works are those presented by Li and Guskov [19] and Lee et al. [20] which introduced extensions of Lowe’s 2 D SIFT [21] to 3 D datasets. Their approach has been subsequently exploited by Castellani et al. [22] and Bonarrigo et al. [6]. SIFT-related feature description distinctiveness against Spin Images has been compared in [23]. Thomas and Sugimoto [24] proposed to use the reflectance properties for images registration to better perform on featureless images. In feature-based approaches, feature points are usually associated to descriptors, which ideally should associate an unambiguous signature to each feature, which is fast to compute and robust to any viewpoint rotation as well as to variations of point density on the image. Li and Guskov [19] proposed a descriptor based on a combination of local Discrete Fourier transform and Discrete Cosine transform to describe the neighborhood of each feature point. Gelfand et al. in [3] proposed the use of volumetric descriptors, that is the estimation of the volume portion inscribed by a sphere centered at a point of the surface. Castellani et al. [22] proposed a statistical descriptor based on a hidden Markov chain that is trained through its neighborhood. Despite scan alignment and similar problems have been thoroughly explored in the literature, meaningful comparisons remain somehow difficult to accomplish for several reasons: the heterogeneity of each approach, the different way in which they are combined into functional alignment pipelines, the variability of the addressed performance and application requirements, the differences of test datasets both in terms of representation primitives (range images, point clouds, meshes, etc.) and data characteristics (resolution, noise, etc.) related to the differences in data acquisition setup and scanning hardware. In particular, even if each block of a feature-based alignment pipeline (feature extraction, description, matching, correspondence selection and transform estimation) can be tested in isolation with respect to alternative solutions (we will do this in Section “Comparative tests”), critical interdependencies exist among the different pipeline blocks. In this work we adopted design criteria which take full account of such interdependency, according to what has been recognized in reference reviewing work [15, 17]. Bustos et al. [17] indicated that a complete and fair comparison of feature extraction and description techniques is unfeasible and that the specific application requirements should inspire and provide guidance for the design of application-driven solutions. Bornstein et al. [15] concluded their review by suggesting to avoid the design of pipelines composed by unnatural block combinations. Another relevant aspect is that multiple-view coarse alignment solutions are usually proposed in literature as simple extensions of pairwise approaches. This leads to a serious limitation on the usability of the acquisition devices. The increased complexity of a multiple-view coarse alignment has been recognized in [1] with a solution proposed by model graphs and visibility consistency tests. An approach based on view trees has been adopted in [9] where multiple-view coarse alignment is obtained by maximization of inlier point pairs. However, these solutions do not allow interactive acquisition because they work on a graph of the pairwise matches once all the alignments are completed, and this conflicts with the need of on-the-fly visual feedbacks. By exploiting the possibility of some range scanners to acquire views at high frame rate (e.g. Kinect and alike sensors), hand-held on-the-fly acquisition and alignment solutions have been proposed [25, 26] with specific solutions for handling loop closure problems [27] or computational burden [28]. However, these interesting applications are still too far from today professional requirements of high point density and metric precision.|$|E
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to develop a {{convergent}} iterative method to obtain two-dimensional steady state solutions of the Navier­-Stokes equations. In the last few years, various successful {{attempts have been made to}} apply numerical methods to obtain both the time dependent and steady state solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations for different types of boundary configurations. The non-linearity of the differential equations makes the convergence of the iterative method difficult. The limitations on the storage capacity of the available computing machines makes it impracticable to obtain solutions having any predetermined accuracy. In addition, the imposition of the natural boundary conditions which prescribe the velocities on the boundaries, also contributes to the complexity of the problem. A brief survey of <b>some</b> <b>representative</b> <b>work</b> done on the numerical solution of Navier-Stokes equations has been given here. The Navier-Stokes equations have been reduced to a system of two second order coupled differential equations which are then solved numerically. Some finite difference schemes have recently been suggested which guarantee the convergence of the iterations for solving the two difference equations. However, these schemes require a certain number of parameters which have to be determined by numerical experimentation. Our aim here is to develop a procedure which would be economical and would require a minimum of numerical experimentation. We have succeeded in showing that only one parameter besides the optimum over-relaxation factors is sufficient for convergence. Different criteria for convergence are studied and the one, which appears to be most efficient, has been used to obtain numerical solutions for the steady flow of a viscous fluid in a two-dimensional cavity flow. Another problem for which the numerical solutions have been obtained is the separating flow due to a thin plate of finite length placed at the point of symmetry of an otherwise two-dimensional stagnation point flow. A non-uniform mesh has been used for this problem and the numerical results for different values of Reynolds number have been obtained. These are given in the form of stream lines and equi-vorticity curves. We have also extended the difference schemes to problem of axisymmetric flows although no numerical results have been obtained. The results obtained in this thesis may be considered as quali­tatively satisfactory in the sense that they exhibit the characteristics of the fluid flow. These results can not be considered quantitatively reliable unless some insight is gained about the convergence of the numer­ical solution of the discretized problem to that of the differential equations. This can partly be done by repeating the calculations using smaller mesh sizes. However, this would require a considerable amount of computing time. It would be interesting to investigate the possibilities of improving the results using some higher order stable difference schemes or finer mesh sizes in the boundary layer only without unduly increasing the computing time...|$|R
40|$|Frege’s Principle, {{also known}} as the {{principle}} of compositionality, is one important concept in areas such as philosophy, linguistics, logic and computer science. In the 1970 s, Richard Montague combined principle of compositionality, First Order Logic, λ-calculus, and type theory into the first formal natural language semantic system, people call it Montague Grammar (MG). However, MG (Montague, 1974) was designed to handle single sentence semantics. Later on, some linguistic phenomena, such as anaphora, donkey sentences, and presupposition projection motivated another branch in the field: dynamic semantics. That is where my research interests mainly lie. More specifically, topics such as event semantics, rhetorical relation, and variable accessibility in discourse and dialogue are what I am working on. 1. 1 Dynamic Semantics & Discourse According to MG, the meaning of a sentence is represented as its truth conditions, that is, the circumstances in which the sentence is true. Different from that, dynamic semantics evaluate the sentence meaning as its context change potential. In other words, meaning is viewed as a function that always builds new information states out of the old ones by updating the current sentence. <b>Some</b> of the <b>representative</b> <b>works</b> include File Change Semantics...|$|R
40|$|Graph pattern {{matching}} involves finding exact or approximate matches for a query subgraph {{in a larger}} graph. It has been studied exten-sively and has strong applications in domains such as computer vi-sion, computational biology, social networks, security and finance. The problem of exact graph {{pattern matching}} is often {{described in terms of}} subgraph isomorphism which is NP-complete. The expo-nential growth in streaming data from online social networks, news and video streams and the continual need for situational awareness motivates a solution for finding patterns in streaming updates. This is also the prime driver for the real-time analytics market. Devel-opment of incremental algorithms for graph pattern matching on streaming inputs to a continually evolving graph is a nascent area of research. Some of the challenges associated with this problem are the same as found in continuous query (CQ) evaluation on stream-ing databases. This paper reviews <b>some</b> of the <b>representative</b> <b>work</b> from the exhaustively researched field of CQ systems and identifies important semantics, constraints and architectural features that are also appropriate for HPC systems performing real-time graph ana-lytics. For each of these features we present a brief discussion of the challenge encountered in the database realm, the approach to the solution and state their relevance in a high-performance, streaming graph processing framework. 1...|$|R
