40|$|A {{thermoelectric}} (TE) <b>subcooler</b> {{was designed}} and fabricated to subcool CO 2 exiting a gas cooler of a transcritical vapor compression cycle test system. The thermoelectric modules operated at efficiencies greater than the baseline system, increasing capacity and the overall coefficient of performance (COP) of the entire system. Subcooling of the CO 2 before the expansion device led to a reduced optimum high side pressure, resulting in greater COP improvement that cannot be achieved in conventional refrigerant vapor compression systems utilizing a TE <b>Subcooler.</b> Improvements in COP of 10 % were demonstrated with a corresponding capacity increase of 13 %. A capacity increase of 24 % was demonstrated at a comparable COP as the baseline system.

40|$|The {{calculations}} done to size {{the control}} dewar <b>subcooler</b> were done {{to obtain a}} sufficient <b>subcooler</b> size based on some conservative assumptions. The final <b>subcooler</b> design proposed in the design report will work even better because (1) It has more tubing length, and (2) will have already subcooled liquid at the inlet due to the transfer line design. The <b>subcooler</b> design described in the 'Design Report of the 2 Tesla Superconducting Solenoid for the Fermilab D 0 Detector Upgrade' is the final design proposed. A short description of this design follows. The <b>subcooler</b> is constructed of 0. 50 -inch OD copper tubing with 1. 0 -inch diameter fins. It has ten and one half spirals at a 11. 375 -inch centerline diameter to provide 31 feet of tubing length. The liquid helium supply for the solenoid flows through the <b>subcooler</b> and then is expanded through a J-T valve. The <b>subcooler</b> spirals are immersed in the return two phase helium process stream. The return stream is directed over the finned tubing by an annulus created by a 10 -inch pipe inside a 12 -inch pipe. The transfer line from the refrigerator to the control dewar is constructed such that the liquid helium supply tube is in the refrigerator return stream, thereby subcooling the liquid {{up to the point}} where the u-tubes connect the transfer line to the control dewar. The <b>subcooler</b> within the control dewar will remove the heat picked up in the helium supply u-tube/bayonets. The attached subcooler/heat exchanger calculations were done neglecting any subcooling in the transfer line. All heat picked up in the transfer line from the refrigerator storage dewar to the control dewar is absorbed by the supply stream. The <b>subcooler</b> was sized such that the two phase supply fluid is subcooled at 1. 7 atm pressure and when expanded through a JT valve to 1. 45 atm pressure it is at a saturated liquid state. The calculations apply during steady state operation and at a flow rate of 16 g/s. The analysis of the heat exchanger was broken into two parts relating to the heat transfer mode taking place. The first part is considered the condensing part in which the helium supply stream is changed from two phase fluid to one phase liquid. The second part is the subcooling part where the liquid temperature is lowered, i. e [...] subcooled. A summary of the calculations and results appears on the next page. The raw calculations follow the summary...|$|E

40|$|Included in this {{engineering}} note {{are three}} separate calculation divisions. The first calculations are {{the determination of}} the required thickness of the LN{sub 2 } <b>subcooler</b> flat head according to ASME code. This section includes Appendix A-C.

40|$|This work {{presents}} an experimental evaluation, from an energy analysis point of view, {{for two of}} the most used inter-stage systems in two-stage vapour compression cycles driven by compound compressors: the direct liquid injection and <b>subcooler</b> systems. The evaluation, considers the two-stage cycle with no intermediate systems as reference cycle and was performed on a plant, driven by a compound compressor using the refrigerant R 404 A for an evaporating temperature range of - 36 to - 20  °C and for a condensing temperature range of 30 - 47  °C. The analysis of the results shows that the inter-stage systems determine the performance of the energy parameters, which are discussed in the paper. The configuration yielding the best results was the two-stage compression cycle with <b>subcooler,</b> since the cooling capacity and COP values for this configuration were the highest.

5000|$|The term <b>subcooling</b> {{refers to}} a liquid {{existing}} at a temperature below its normal boiling point. For example, water boils at 373 K; at room temperature (300 K) the water is termed [...] "subcooled". A <b>subcooled</b> liquid is the convenient state in which, say, refrigerants may undergo the remaining stages of a refrigeration cycle. Normally, a refrigeration system has a <b>subcooling</b> stage, allowing technicians {{to be certain that}} the quality, in which the refrigerant reaches the next step on the cycle, is the desired one. <b>Subcooling</b> may take place in heat exchangers and outside them.

40|$|When {{a liquid}} starts to solidify only when cooled well below its melting temperature, {{this is called}} <b>subcooling.</b> From {{nucleation}} theory, <b>subcooling</b> {{is expected to increase}} for small volumes due to statistics and seed isolation effects. PCM emulsions are superior in their heat transfer rates compared to larger PCM modules.

50|$|Finally, another {{widespread}} {{application of}} <b>subcooling</b> is boosting and economising. Inversely to superheating, <b>subcooling,</b> or {{the amount of}} heat withdrawn from the liquid refrigerant on the <b>subcooling</b> process, manifests itself as an increase on the refrigeration capacity of the system. This means that any extra heat removal after the condensation (<b>subcooling)</b> allows a higher ratio of heat absorption on further stages of the cycle. It is to be noted that superheating has exactly the inverse effect, and that an internal heat exchanger alone, {{is not able to}} increase the capacity of the system because the boosting effect of <b>subcooling</b> is dimmed by the superheating, making the net capacity gain equal to zero. Nevertheless, some systems are able to move refrigerant and/or to remove heat using up less energy because they do so on high pressure fluids that later cool or <b>subcool</b> lower pressure (which are more difficult to cool) fluids.|$|R

40|$|The thermal and {{electrical}} behaviour {{of the current}} buses in the chimney of the D 0 solenoid during upset conditions is modeled to guide the selection of trip levels for magnet protection circuits which discharge the magnet if abnormal conditions are detected. The current buses in the chimney are designed to operate safely without likelihood of loss of superconductivity as long as normal cooling conditions are maintained. Helium liquid level probes, helium flow instrumentation, and thermometry all are provided to certify that proper cooling conditions exist in the <b>subcooler</b> and chimney at all times. Rising temperatures in any portion of the system, excessive voltage drops on the vapor cooled leads, or decreasing liquid level in the <b>subcooler</b> or flow rate in the system, will each cause the fast discharge system to be triggered. Postulated failures of the helium flow system, somehow undetected by any {{and all of the}} aforementioned instrumentation, can in principal eventually lead to loss of superconductivity in the buses. Quenching in one bus will rapidly lead to quenching in the other. Potential taps on the buses and magnet coil halves connected to voltage-detection bridges external to the system provide at least dually redundant signals which will unambiguously trigger the magnet rapid discharge system. The conservative design of the bus system ensures that it will not be damaged during such incidents, however improbable they may be. The transition leads in the <b>subcooler</b> are equally conservatively designed, and would not be damaged if they were operated in a fully non-superconducting state for several minutes. The loss of liquid helium in the sub cooler required to cause this condition would imply that helium flow from the magnet had stopped, which in turn would imply that flow to the magnet had also stopped. The lack of flow into the sub cooler would result in insufficient flow to the vapor cooled leads. Any or all of these conditions would be detected, as would easily detected spurious voltages on the potential tap system, before damage to the transition leads occurred...|$|E

40|$|Boiling {{two-phase}} flow {{is found in}} many industrial applications such as boiling water reactors, {{two-phase flow}} heat exchangers and refrigeration systems. The physics of two-phase gas-liquid flow may lead to undesirable system instabilities, and in the literature density wave oscillations (DWO) {{is reported to be}} the most commonly observed instability phenomenon. However, the literature alsoprovides two opposing views on what the fundamental mechanism of DWO is. The so-called classical description of DWO focuses on the variation in mixture density as the governing mechanism, and the oscillation period will consequently be about one to two times the channel residence time. The findings presented in citet{Rizwan-Uddin 1994 } show that it is the variation in mixture velocity that hasthe dominating effect, and the oscillation period was reported to be closer to four times the channel residence time. citet{Ambrosini 2000 } united the two opposing views by stating that the governing mechanismdepends on the level of system <b>subcooling.</b> The classical description of DWO is based on a lower level of <b>subcooling,</b> while citet{Rizwan-Uddin 1994 } considered higher <b>subcooling.</b> Here, the fundamental mechanisms of DWO and the effect of system <b>subcooling</b> is investigated further by performing a numerical analysis using a one dimensional homogenous equilibrium flow model. The modeled system consists of a horizontal uniformlyheated boiling channel with an inlet- and exit restriction. The system is exposed to constant externally imposed pressure drop. The effect of system <b>subcooling</b> is investigated by comparing the self-sustained periodicoscillations which make out the modeled stability threshold. The flow model is validated by observing the above mentioned effects of <b>subcooling</b> on DWO. Further, it is found that the change from a density dominated exit restriction towards a velocity dominated exit restriction is a smooth transition for increased <b>subcooling.</b> The amplitude of the variations in exit mixture velocity increases continuously with <b>subcooling,</b> anddue to the squared relationship between the exit restriction pressure drop and the exit mixture velocity, velocity becomes the governing mechanism at high <b>subcooling.</b> The modeled stability threshold approaches a straight line at high <b>subcooling.</b> This line represents operating conditions which have the same mean boiling boundary location. However, the amplitude of the variations about this mean limit grows exponentially at high <b>subcooling.</b> The oscillation period of the observed DWO grows continuously with higher <b>subcooling,</b> and the period increases exponentially at high <b>subcooling.</b> In contrast, the mean boiling channel residence time approaches an upper mean limit at high <b>subcooling.</b> It is postulated that it is the transition towards a more mixture velocity dominated system that causes the oscillation period to evolve as it does with respect to the level of <b>subcooling...</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} and very common application of <b>subcooling</b> is its indirect {{use on the}} superheating process. Superheating is analogous to <b>subcooling</b> in an operative way, and both processes can be coupled using an internal heat exchanger. <b>Subcooling</b> here serves itself from the superheating and vice versa, allowing heat to flow from the refrigerant at a higher pressure (liquid), to the one with lower pressure (gas). This creates an energetic equivalence between the <b>subcooling</b> and the superheating phenomena {{when there is no}} energy loss. Normally, the fluid that is being <b>subcooled</b> is hotter than the refrigerant that is being superheated, allowing an energy flux in the needed direction. Superheating is critical for the operation of compressors because a system lacking it may provide the compressor with a liquid gas mixture, situation that generally leads to the destruction of the gas compressor because liquid is uncompressible. This makes <b>subcooling</b> an easy and widespread source of heat for the superheating process.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented {{that explains the}} variation of superheat with <b>subcooling</b> that has been observed {{by a number of}} researchers investigating nucleate boiling heat transfer at constant heat flux. It is shown that superheat initially increases with increasing <b>subcooling</b> near saturated conditions because {{of the way in which}} changes in active site density and average bubble frequency with increasing <b>subcooling</b> affect the rate of heat removal from the heater surface by enthalpy transport and microlayer evaporation. As <b>subcooling</b> increases further, natural convection begins to play an increasingly important role in the heat transfer process. Ultimately, natural convection is able to accommodate the entire imposed heat flux, after which superheat decreases as <b>subcooling</b> increases. The success of the analysis in explaining the variation of superheat with <b>subcooling</b> suggests that the rate of the heat removal from the heater surface is completely determined by the mechanisms of enthalpy transport, natural convection, and microlayer evaporation...|$|R

Â For typical R- 134 a and R- 410 A systems, subcooling increases capacity by approximately. 5 to. 7 %/Â°F (~. 9 to 1. 3 %/K) without increasing compressor input power.

The large temperature change greatly reduces the required tank size compared to conventional chilled-water storage, which is typically limited to a temperature change of about 10 to 20 Â°F (5 to 11 K). The high temperatures of warm water in the tank combined with lower nighttime air temperatures reduce energy required to cool the tank and improve overall system efficiency in addition to providing a large reduction in peak electric demand.

The adopted methodology has been mainly experimental. Plate heat exchangers functioning as generator, solution heat exchanger, condenser and <b>subcooler</b> have been incorporated in the design. Two adiabatic absorber configurations, droplets and liquid sheets, were tested and evaluation parameters were experimentally determined. Overall test facility performance is analyzed {{in the first stage}} of the research. The preliminary analysis gives an idea about the operational features of the machine, which allow subsequent detailed components analysis. This analysis is oriented to the interpretation of experimental data including the particular features, in both design and operation, of the facility here presented: study of evaporators’ efficiency, solution heat exchanger efficiency and thermal losses. Performance parameters, cooling capacity and COP, are expressed in terms of a diagnostic absorption model and compared with experimental results. The differences observed between ideal and experimental results help to validate the influence of components performances on the overall performance of the facility. An extension of the characteristic equation method, based on the characteristic temperature difference to adiabatic absorption chillers, has been developed and applied considering the facility features. Evaporator limitations have been included in the analysis. The agreement between experimental data and the extended characteristic equation is discussed, showing a good predictive capability, even at off-design operating conditions. The performances of two types of absorbers (liquid sheets and droplets as solution spreading mechanisms in the absorber) have been characterized in terms of heat and mass transfer.

The TIS has an optimum where the COP is a maximum. An equation for calculating the optimal TIS is proposed. The paper further discusses how the new cycle behaves under different circumstances. It is evident that the new cycle is feasible, and energy savings can be achieved. ...|$|E
50|$|Besides {{boosting}} and economizing, it {{is possible}} to produce cascade <b>subcooling</b> systems, able to <b>subcool</b> the liquid with an analogous and separate system. This procedure is complex and costly as it involves the use of a complete system (with compressors and all of the gear) only for <b>subcooling.</b> Still, the idea has raised some investigation as there are some purported benefits. Furthermore, the United States Department of Energy issued a Federal Technology Alert mentioning refrigerant <b>subcooling</b> as a reliable way of improving the performance of systems and saving energy. Making this kind of system operationally independent from the main system and commercially possible is subject to study due to the mentioned claims. The separation of the <b>subcooling</b> unit from the main cycle (in terms of design) is not known to be an economically viable alternative. This kind of system usually requires the use of expensive electronic control systems to monitor the fluid thermodynamic conditions. Recently, a product capable of increasing the system's capacity by adding mechanical <b>subcooling</b> to any generic unspecific refrigeration system has been developed in Chile.|$|R
40|$|The initial {{thickness}} of methane hydrate film was directly measured by suspending a single methane bubble in water at 274. 0, 276. 0, and 278. 0 K. The {{results show that}} the initial hydrate film thickness decreases from tens of micrometers to about 10 3 ̆bcm with the <b>subcooling</b> increased from 0. 5 K to about 3 K. When <b>subcooling</b> is higher than 1. 0 K, all initial film thickness data measured under different temperatures vary inversely with the <b>subcooling.</b> Notable three-dimensional growths of hydrate crystals of different sizes and shapes at film front and emergence of new crystal were clearly observed at lower <b>subcooling</b> that resulting in the rougher surface of hydrate film and uncertainty of initial thickness measurement under lower <b>subcooling.</b> The hydrate film growth was dominated by film growth in thickness, not by lateral growth at low <b>subcooling.</b> The growth in {{thickness of}} hydrate shell covering one whole bubble surface was also investigated. 9 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).
