5|$|Horner did {{not perform}} an exact {{cladistic}} analysis determining {{the relationship between the}} three populations. Such an analysis calculates which evolutionary tree implies the lowest number of evolutionary changes and therefore is the most likely. He assumed that this would result in a tree in which the types were successive branches. <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> tree would, {{as a consequence of the}} method used, never show a direct ancestor-descendant relationship. Many scientists believed <b>such</b> <b>a</b> relation could never be proven anyway. Horner disagreed: he saw the gradual morphological changes as clear proof that, in this case, the evolution of one taxon into another, without a splitting of the populations, could be directly observed. Evolutionists in general would be too hesitant to recognize this. <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> transition is called anagenesis; he posited that, if the opposite, cladogenesis, could not be proven, a scientist was free to assume an anagenetic process.|$|E
