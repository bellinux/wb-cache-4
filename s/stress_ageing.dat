Using a diphtheria toxin-mediated assay for measuring the levels of ADP-ribosylatable elongation factor EF- 2, we have observed an irreversible decrease of up to 64 % in the amount of ADP-ribosylatable EF- 2 in normal diploid human fibroblasts MRC- 5 undergoing ageing in vitro. However, a similar decrease in low serum-associated G 0 /G 1 -arrested cells is reversible both in MRC- 5 cells and in their SV 40 -transformed counterparts.

It {{is well known that}} aging is highly associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Growing evidence also shows that obesity and metabolic diseases accelerate aging process. Studies in experimental animal models demonstrate similarity of metabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes in metabolic diseases and old age, e. g. insulin resistance, oxidative stress, chronic low grade inflammation, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and heart failure, as well as vascular dysfunctions. Despite intensive research, the molecular mechanisms linking metabolic <b>stress,</b> <b>aging,</b> and ultimately cardiovascular diseases are still elusive. Although the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling is a well known regulator of metabolism and lifespan in model organisms, its central role in linking metabolic <b>stress,</b> <b>aging</b> and cardiovascular diseases is recently emerging.

40|$|International audienceDifferent {{models have}} been {{developed}} to understand the biology of skin or to test pharmaceutical/cosmetic products. These models can be in vitro models that possess advantages such as mono and co-culture models in 2 D, which are very reproducible, or organotypic models (skin explant and reconstructed skin) that present a 3 D organisation. Animal or human in vivo models allow studies that are closer to reality. In virtuo models developed on computers control all known parameters and do not require animals. The major limitations of these models are the lack of 3 D structure for in vitro culture, the variability of results from organotypic models, ethical problems inherent to human and animal tests and the presence of numerous unknown parameters in in virtuo systems. Despite their limitations, skin explants seem to be an interesting model for studies. Skin explants may be kept from a few hours to 10 - 14 days on supports or directly in culture medium. These explants are generally cultivated at 37  °C, 5 % CO(2), preferentially in serum-free conditions.

40|$|Purpose Cancer is {{a disease}} of the elderly: 60 % of tumours occur in {{patients}} aged 65 years or older. Cancer-related fatigue is a common symptom experienced by cancer pa-tients and cancer survivors that profoundly affects {{all aspects of the}} quality of life. Although {{it has been estimated that}} up to 70 % of elderly with cancer experience fatigue, this symptom is still largely ignored in ageing population. Methods We performed a systematic review of the literature identified by MEDLINE. Results The relationship between ageing process and patho-genesis of cancer-related fatigue is still not fully understood. Conclusions Ageing is associated with an increased preva-lence of chronic diseases, decreased functional reserve in multiple organ systems and enhanced susceptibility to <b>stress.</b> <b>Ageing</b> and the concomitant presence of a condition of frailty may predispose to the presence of fatigue. Nevertheless, only few studies have to date specifically assessed the impact of fatigue in the geriatric population. Since cancer-related fa-tigue is a peculiarly debilitating condition characteristic of elderly cancer patient population, we suggest the early rec-ognition and thorough evaluation of the symptom fatigue, its co-existing causes (i. e. anaemia, mood disorders and sleep disturbances) and co-morbidities (i. e., endocrine disorders, metabolic, cardiovascular and liver diseases) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{endothelium}} can evoke relaxations (dilatations) of {{the underlying}} vascular smooth muscle, by releasing vasodilator substances. The best characterized endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) is nitric oxide (NO). The endothelial cells also evoke hyperpolarization of the cell membrane of vascular smooth muscle (endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizations, EDHF-mediated responses). Endothelium-dependent relaxations involve both pertussis toxin-sensitive G i (e. g. responses to serotonin and thrombin) and pertussis toxin-insensitive G q (e. g. adenosine diphosphate and bradykinin) coupling proteins. The release of NO by the endothelial cell can be up-regulated (e. g. by oestrogens, exercise and dietary factors) and down-regulated (e. g. oxidative stress, smoking and oxidized low-density lipoproteins). It is reduced {{in the course of}} vascular disease (e. g. diabetes and hypertension). Arteries covered with regenerated endothelium (e. g. following angioplasty) selectively loose the pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway for NO release which favours vasospasm, thrombosis, penetration of macrophages, cellular growth and the inflammatory reaction leading to atherosclerosis. In addition to the release of NO (and causing endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizations), endothelial cells also can evoke contraction (constriction) {{of the underlying}} vascular smooth muscle cells by releasing endothelium-derived contracting factor (EDCF). Most endothelium-dependent acute increases in contractile force are due to the formation of vasoconstrictor prostanoids (endoperoxides and prostacyclin) which activate TP receptors of the vascular smooth muscle cells. EDCF-mediated responses are exacerbated when the production of NO is impaired (e. g. by oxidative <b>stress,</b> <b>ageing,</b> spontaneous hypertension and diabetes). They contribute to the blunting of endothelium-dependent vasodilatations in aged subjects and essential hypertensive patients. © 2008 Scandinavian Physiological Society. postprin...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThere is much {{interest}} in understanding the mechanisms responsible for interactions among <b>stress,</b> <b>ageing,</b> memory and Alzheimer´s disease.

Maternal separation (MS), a model of early life stress in which rats experience 3 -hour daily separations from the dam during the first 3 weeks of life, was used to study the interactions between stress and ageing. Young (3 months) MS rats showed an altered HPA axis reactivity, depressive-like behavior in the Porsolt swimming test and cognitive impairments in the Morris water maze and novel object recognition test that persisted in aged (18 months) rats. Levels of insulin receptor, phosphorylated insulin receptor and markers of downstream signaling pathways (pAkt, pGSK 3 β, pTau and pERK 1 levels) were significantly decreased in aged rats.

40|$|Within {{the frame}} of the European Network AMES (Ageing Materials Evaluation & Studies), several shared cost action {{projects}} are ongoing on understanding, assessment, mitigation of the ageing mechanisms. In particular, materials are ageing due to many different causes; e. g. thermal treatment, thermal ageing, <b>stress</b> <b>ageing,</b> corrosion, irradiation embrittlement, and on such issues the European Network AMES is currently focusing. The assessment of material ageing requires narmally extensive destructive testing by using different kinds of testing and samples. One example is the use of the Charpy impact technique. The possibility to use of Non Destructive Techniques, NDT, for assessing material ageing is very promising and needs further investigation, assessment and qualification. The possibility to qualify Non Destructive Techniques, NDT, at least for some of the above mentioned ageing cases, would make the studies on ageing and the relative assessment much easier and cheaper, saving a lot o f money and resources in Europe. Futhermore, it would make it possible to assess on site various components that now-a-days can only be assessed either by calculation or by means of very expensive sample gaining techniques. This last factor would mean a terrific increase in EC citizen safety. About the feasibility, it has to be noted that a growing number of publications on the subject are appearing more and more in the proceedings of International Conferencrs like the recent ICONE Conference. The AMES-NDT Concered Action, sponsored by the Nuclear Fission Safety programme of the EC, is aiming to undertake the intermediate needed step of listing all known techniques, their application and limits and reporting on sample demonstration tests befor a proper systematic qualification of techniques.
