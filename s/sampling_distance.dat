30|$|The curved {{shape of}} the {{retaining}} wall presents a difficult task when attempting to produce accurate models. The scale bars were attached to tripods and arranged according to the scenario. Thirty-two <b>sample</b> <b>distances</b> were selected between the red reflective points on the markers attached {{to the wall and}} then used for accuracy comparisons. The <b>sample</b> <b>distances</b> were selected in this way because there were no prominent natural features on the retaining wall that could be manually referenced and used to create <b>sample</b> <b>distances.</b> The ground truth data was collected by measuring the distance between the centers of two points on the markers with a tape measure.|$|R
30|$|The {{concrete}} slab model presented a challenge {{because of its}} position {{on the ground and}} its planar shape. The scale bars were laid directly {{on the ground in the}} scenario positions listed above. There were twenty <b>sample</b> <b>distances</b> taken between two corners of individual rectangular sections within the slab, and these <b>sample</b> <b>distances</b> were oriented diagonally, vertically, and horizontally to ensure that accurate comparisons could be accomplished. In order to take <b>sample</b> <b>distances</b> in this manner, these points had to be manually referenced in iWitness on three or more photos for sufficient accuracy. The ground truth values, compared against the distances given by the six models, were collected by a tape measure.|$|R

Instead of arranging the scale bars in the six scenarios, one scale bar was referenced {{in the middle of}} each wall of the building (in other words, four total scale bars) and the <b>sample</b> <b>distance</b> values were obtained on the model. To compare the effect of the quantity of total scale bars, we decreased the number of scale bars by increments of one and recorded the <b>sample</b> <b>distance</b> values.|$|R

A {{comprehensive}} analysis of contrast formation mechanisms in {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM) experiments on a metal oxide surface is presented with the oxygen-induced (2 √ 2 √ 2) R 45 missing row reconstruction of the Cu(100) surface as a model system. Density functional theory and electronic transport calculations were combined to simulate the STM imaging behavior of pure and oxygen-contaminated metal tips with structurally and chemically different apexes while systematically varying bias voltage and tip <b>sample</b> <b>distance.</b> The resulting multiparameter database of computed images was used to conduct an extensive comparison with experimental data. Excellent agreement was attained for {{a large number of}} cases, suggesting that the assumed model tips reproduce most of the commonly encountered contrast-determining effects. Specifically, we find that depending on the bias voltage polarity, copper-terminated tips allow selective imaging of two structurally distinct surface Cu sites, while oxygenterminated tips show complex contrasts with pronounced asymmetry and tip <b>sample</b> <b>distance</b> dependence. Considering the structural and chemical stability of the tips reveals that the copper-terminated apexes tend to react with surface oxygen at small tip <b>sample</b> <b>distances.</b> In contrast, oxygenterminated tips are considerably more stable, allowing exclusive surface oxygen imaging at small tip <b>sample</b> <b>distances.</b> Our results provide a conclusive understanding of fundamental STM imaging mechanisms, thereby providing guidelines for experimentalists to achieve chemically selective imaging by properly selecting imaging parameters...|$|R

30|$|There is a {{built-in}} distance function in iWitness {{that allows the}} user to measure the distance between two points.

30|$|The storage {{building}} model {{was the only}} full object model completed in our research. The six scale bar scenarios were carried out {{on each of the}} four walls, so, for the model generated under Scenario 1, there were four total scale bars (one placed in the middle of each wall). Twenty-four <b>sample</b> <b>distances</b> were taken in between the corners of individual bricks on the wall.

5000|$|There is an {{exponential}} {{increase in}} volume associated with adding extra dimensions to a mathematical space. For example, 102=100 evenly spaced sample points suffice to sample a unit interval (a [...] "1-dimensional cube") {{with no more}} than 10−2=0.01 distance between points; an equivalent sampling of a 10-dimensional unit hypercube with a lattice that has a spacing of 10−2=0.01 between adjacent points would require 1020=(102)10 sample points. In general, with a spacing distance of 10−n the 10-dimensional hypercube appears to be a factor of 10n(10-1)=(10n)10/(10n) [...] "larger" [...] than the 1-dimensional hypercube, which is the unit interval. In the above example n=2: when using a <b>sampling</b> <b>distance</b> of 0.01 the 10-dimensional hypercube appears to be 1018 [...] "larger" [...] than the unit interval. This effect is a combination of the combinatorics problems above and the distance function problems explained below.|$|E
50|$|Cultural {{heritage}} is present everywhere. Its structural control, documentation and conservation {{is one of}} humanity's main duties (UNESCO). Under this point of view, SfM is used in order to properly estimate situations as well as planning and maintenance efforts and costs, control and restoration.Because serious constraints often exist connected to the accessibility of the site and impossibility to install invasive surveying pillars that did not {{permit the use of}} traditional surveying routines (like total stations), SfM provides a non-invasive approach for the structure, without the direct interaction between the structure and any operator. The use is accurate as only qualitative considerations are needed. It is fast enough to respond to the monument’s immediate management needs.The first operational phase is an accurate preparation of the photogrammetric surveying where is established the relation between best distance from the object, focal length, the ground <b>sampling</b> <b>distance</b> (GSD) and the sensor’s resolution. With this information the programmed photographic acquisitions must be made using vertical overlapping of at least 60% (figure 02).|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{variation}} in the fish communities of four small Belgian rivers with variable habitat diversity was investigated by electric fishing to define the minimum <b>sampling</b> <b>distance</b> required for optimal fish stock assessment and determination of the Index of Biotic Integrity. This study shows that the standardised <b>sampling</b> <b>distance</b> of 100 m was not always sufficient to collect most species present. The required minimum <b>sampling</b> <b>distance</b> seems to be correlated with habitat diversity. In homogeneous streams, a mean sample distance of 282, 452 and 572 m is necessary to capture 80, 90 and 95 % of all species present, respectively. In heterogeneous streams, these sample distances decrease to 217, 380 and 503 m. Hence, at least 300 m should be sampled to catch most species present with a single-pass sampling method. However, our results show that a 100 m <b>sampling</b> <b>distance</b> as presently used in the Flemish monitoring programs is sufficient to accurately describe the ecological quality since differences in IBI evaluation between adjacent stretches could at least for some rivers be explained by differences in habitat heterogeneit...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} undercount or incomplete detection in enumeration surveys which are intended to estimate population counts or population abundance. The problem is widespread in ecology but also occurs in other surveys: The census undercount is a well-known example of the problem.

40|$|The conformality of a dose {{distribution}} {{delivered by}} a multileaf collimator (MLC) for intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) {{is limited in}} the direction perpendicular to leaf motion by the finite leaf width. Two methods of improving the resolution of IMRT intensity maps in this direction were investigated. In the first, the desired fluence distribution {{is considered to be}} sampled by the MLC, with the <b>sampling</b> <b>distance</b> being the center-to-center distance between the MLC leaves. The <b>sampling</b> <b>distance</b> is reduced below the leaf width by combining separate irradiations with a couch shift between them. This has been applied to static field therapy [Galvin et al., Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., Biol., Phys. 35, 89 – 94 (1996) ], and was proposed for IMRT by Bortfeld et al. [Med. Phys. 27, 2494 – 2502 (2000) ]. In the second method, two MLC component fluences, with leaf width L = 2 Δy and offset by Δy, are combined to reproduce desired intensity bins with Δy width. The effect of MLC leaf <b>sampling</b> <b>distance</b> on dose resolution was quantified for both 1. 0 and 0. 5 cm MLC leaf widths, utilizing a high resolution bar-pattern fluence, an annular shaped fluence, and an intensity step-edge. Improvement in resolution was found for the 1. 0 cm leaf width at a <b>sampling</b> <b>distance</b> of 0. 5 cm, with only a small benefit for further reduction.

Our algorithm is to first apply the 3 D discrete wavelet transform on the volume, then create an index volume to indicate the necessary <b>sampling</b> <b>distance</b> at each voxel. During ray casting, the original volume is traversed in the spatial domain, while the index volume is used to decide the appropriate <b>sampling</b> <b>distance.</b> We demonstrate that our algorithm provides a framework for approximating the volume rendering at different levels of quality in a rapid and controlled way. ...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis study uses seismic {{modeling}} {{to better}} understand the seismic response of the free gas that accumulates beneath hydrate-bearing sediments. To this end, I developed 12 different geological models ranging from very simple geometries to anticline structures. Within these models, I varied the distribution of free gas in the layers beneath the BSR. Sediment properties were taken from velocity profiles of the Storegga gas hydrate system and the density approximately estimated from a computed Gassmann diagram. Norsar 2 D, Norsar 3 D and Seisrox modeling programs were used to generate PSDM seismic images. Higher frequencies, large incident angle and long horizontal <b>sampling</b> <b>distances</b> has resulted in the generation of BSR as termination of enhanced reflection. The termination of the enhanced reflections coincided with anticlinal and dipping BSR in this study. The presence of intercalation of gas free and hydrate bearing layers above the dipping BSR and gas free and gas bearing sediments below the dipping BSR led to the termination of enhanced reflection at the BGHSZ. Low frequency, near angle and small <b>sampling</b> <b>distances</b> resulted in proper BSR reflections for the geologic setting mentioned above. Lower frequency and large <b>sampling</b> <b>distances</b> results in termination of enhanced reflection of the BSR.
