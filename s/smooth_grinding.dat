50|$|The Lisbon’s arched-mouth nase {{is a small}} cyprinid. Adults {{range from}} 5 to 11 cm, though there are records of {{specimens}} reaching ca. 18 cm. It can be distinguished from the other Iberian nase species {{by the lack of}} horny blade on the lower jaw, the absence of intense reddish coloration {{at the base of the}} fins and by its pronouncedly arched mouth. It has elongated pelvic fins that reach the anus and often pass the anal-fin insertion in males, and dorsal, pelvic and anal fins usually have 8 branched rays. This species has 36 to 43 scales in the lateral line, 7.0 to 8.5 scales above the lateral line, 13 to 16 circumpeduncular scales, denticulated (vs. <b>smooth)</b> <b>grinding</b> teeth surfaces, 6-5/5 pharyngeal teeth and 15 to 19 gill rakers. It is further distinguished from Iberochondrostoma lusitanicum, a phylogenetically close species that lives in the same area, by having a higher body, a relatively longer head, and a larger eye. The origins of anal and pelvic fins are displaced anteriorly, while the origin of pectoral fins is displaced posteriorly. Pelvic and pectoral fins and last anal-fin ray are longer in the new species. Unlike the other phylogenetically related species, the Lisbon’s arched-mouth nase shows external sexual dimorphism, with males having longer pelvic fins whose extremities pass the anus and often overlap with the anal fin.|$|E

Relative motion between {{grinding}} wheel and workpiece makes the {{lubricant film pressure}} formed by grinding fluid in the grinding area increase, consequently, dynamic pressure lubrication forms. The grinding fluid flow field mathematical model in <b>smooth</b> <b>grinding</b> area is established based on lubrication theory. The dynamic pressure of grinding fluid field, flow velocity and carrying capacity of lubricating film are calculated by the numerical analysis method. An analysis of effect of grinding fluid hydrodynamic on the total lifting force is performed, {{and the results are}} obtained...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the problem of {{stationary}} provision of grinding surface by creating the uniform abrasive impact on it. Mechanisms of forming the non-uniform abrasive action on machined surface grinding with the periphery of a start disk have been defined. It was revealed that stationary breaking of micro and macro geometry of grinding surfaces basically occurs in the areas of input of grinding disk in contact with machined surface and output from it and in the areas of configuration changes of machined surface. On the basis of analysis of analytical expressions, a new construction of the grinding disk has been worked out. It was determined that uniform abrasive action on machined surface is being provided at grinding with varied grained disk, therefore high grinding efficiency. It is explained with the concentrating on the operating surface of anisomerous grinding disk of granularity, starting with rough and ending with thin, allows combining the elements of rough and <b>smooth</b> <b>grinding</b> in one processing step. ...|$|E

The increased load due to dynamic impact results in higher stresses in the pavement materials and consequently lower road life. By providing an extremely <b>smooth</b> surface, diamond <b>grinding</b> limits dynamic loading.|$|R

40|$|Engineering process {{preparation}} requires proper {{preparation of}} cutting tools. It influences {{not only the}} performance of the tools but also the quality of workpiece surface machining. One of the promising environmentally friendly trends of mechanical treatment is grinding without using lubricating cooling liquid. This method can considerably influence the quality of cutting tools <b>grinding.</b> <b>Smoothing</b> skiving turning is an effective treatment method providing high efficiency and workpiece quality. Proper preparation of cutting edges is especially important in this process.

40|$|The work is {{concerned}} with the effects of applying the drum detachers as flake disrupters in industrial wheat flour mills. The stocks entering and leaving the drum detachers applied on the different reduction passages in two industrial mills were intercepted and employed in the experiments. The changes in the flour release and flour ash content were followed. The results show that the drum detachers are effective in disrupting the flakes formed in the <b>smooth</b> roller mills <b>grinding</b> zone. However, the contribution of the drum detachers to the overall milling efficiency is in close correlation with the nature of the formed flakes. If the flakes are primarily composed of endosperm particles, the employment of drum detacher results in a statistically significant increase of the flour yields without deterioration of flour quality. If flakes, formed on the end passages of the reduction system, contain large portion of branny particles, the increase of the flour ash content following the drum detacher is statistically significant.

40|$|Este artigo apresenta um estudo da agressividade do rebolo (habilidade de corte). A retificação é um processo de usinagem preciso, o qual é amplamente usado na manufatura de componentes que requerem tolerâncias estreitas e superfícies bem acabadas. Na retificação, a ferramenta abrasiva é o rebolo, que é basicamente composto por núcleo, ligante e grãos abrasivos. As ferramentas testadas nessa pesquisa foram rebolos convencional (Al 2 O 3) e superabrasivo (CBN). Entre os superabrasivos, três tipos específicos de ligantes foram testados: resinóide, vitrificado e resinóide de alto desempenho. Conseqüentemente, foi possível avaliar a habilidade de corte entre os diferentes tipos de rebolos testados. Assim, o rebolo convencional de óxido de alumínio apresentou a maior agressividade. This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the grinding wheel sharpness (cutting ability). Grinding is a precision machining process which is widely used in the manufacture of components requiring fine tolerances and <b>smooth</b> surfaces. In <b>grinding,</b> the abrasive tool is the grinding wheel, which is basically compounded by the core, the bond and the abrasive grains. The tools tested in this research were conventional (Al 2 O 3) and superabrasive (CBN) grinding wheels. Among the superabrasive ones, three specific bond types were tested: resin, vitrified and high performance resin bond. Consequently, it was possible to evaluate the comparative cutting ability among the different types of grinding wheels tested. So the conventional wheel (Al 2 O 3) presented the highest sharpness...|$|R
40|$|Dental nickel–titanium (NiTi) rotary {{instruments}} {{are widely used}} in endodontic therapy because they are efficient with a higher success rate. However, an unpredictable fracture of instruments may happen due to the surface characteristics of imperfection (or irregularity). This study assessed whether a novel surface treatment could increase fatigue fracture resistance of dental NiTi {{rotary instruments}}. Methods: A 200 - or 500 -nm thick Ti–zirconium–boron (Ti-Zr-B) thin film metallic glass was deposited on ProTaper Universal F 2 files using a physical vapor deposition process. The characteristics of coating were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffractometry. In cyclic fatigue tests, the files were performed in a simulated root canal (radius= 5  mm, angulation= 60 °) under a rotating speed of 300 rpm. The fatigue fractured cross sections of the files were analyzed with their fractographic performances through scanning electron microscopy images. Results: The amorphous structure of the Ti-Zr-B coating was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry. The surface of treated files presented <b>smooth</b> morphologies without <b>grinding</b> irregularity. For the 200 - and 500 -nm surface treatment groups, the coated files exhibited higher resistance of cyclic fatigue than untreated files. In fractographic analysis, treated files showed significantly larger crack-initiation zone; however, {{no significant differences in}} the areas of fatigue propagation and catastrophic fracture were found compared to untreated files. Conclusion: The novel surface treatment of Ti-Zr-B thin film metallic glass on dental NiTi rotary files can effectively improve the fatigue fracture resistance by offering a smooth coated surface with amorphous microstructure...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} work was primarily concentrated on precise ductile-mode grinding (milling) of flat surfaces of silicon, mainly Integrated Circuit (IC) silicon chips (dies), which were about 700 Âµm thick {{and the top}} of their surfaces covered with a silicon nitride layer. Substantial amount of partial-ductile streaks on a machined silicon surface shortens polishing time dramatically. This is of vital importance particularly in chip-making and optical industries for failure analysis. Failure analysis is a technique usually practised for locating a fault in a finished IC product. In chip-making industries, the analysis is done on the damage-free mirror-like finished silicon die of the IC. Grinding, lapping and/or polishing operations are required to get such a <b>smooth</b> surface. Precision <b>grinding</b> in a ductile mode therefore remains the critical and most important machining operation as the surface and sub-surface damages will be minimized. This results in good quality surface in terms of surface finish and flatness {{and at the same time}} generating the maximum amount of ductile streaks on the machined surface. Silicon material other than the IC silicon was also tried out for purpose of comparison and because of limited number of IC chips. Silicon like any hard and brittle material is well known for its low machinability unless it is machined under ductile mode condition. Ductile mode machining is a process that makes brittle materials to behave like ductile materials. A low cost machining technique, which facilitates partial-ductile mode grinding of small areas on thin wafer-like silicon, was developed. A specially modified conventional MAHO CNC Vertical Milling Centre that has an air driven low powered high-speed attachment (precision jig grinder) facilitated the diamond grinding. Special fixtures were designed and fabricated that held the workpieces in position and prevented them from damage during machining. Both traditional and statistical techniques for designing of experiments and subsequent analysis of results were employed in this study. A low cutting force dynamometer (Compacdyn) was used to measure cutting forces. Form Talysurf and Surfcom Surface Analysers and Atomic Force Microscope were used to measure surface texture parameters. Optical, Scanning Electron microscopy techniques, together with the Surfcom Surface Analyser and Atomic Force Microscope, were used to examine the surface morphology of the machined silicon surfaces. It was found that the amount of ductile streaks generated on a work-piece surface was not only dependent on feed and depth of cut but also on the grit size of diamond abrasive. The machining technique of grinding yielded ground surfaces with Ra as low as 50 nm, and forces around 0. 8 Newton. Flatness of the machined surfaces is very good. A model of surface roughness (Ra) for precision grinding of thin silicon has been established...|$|R
40|$|The Drakensberg is {{the highest}} part of a 1000 -km long {{escarpment}} that also forms a natural border between South Africa and eastern Lesotho. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park was declared a World Heritage site in 2000 and is globally significant, in particular due to the rock art painted by San hunter-gatherers who inhabited the area from about 8 000 years ago until the late 19 th Century. Approximately 30 000 painted images {{can be found in}} nearly 600 rock shelters in the area. Rock art heritage in the Drakensberg is unfortunately being lost through a variety of processes, some natural and others resulting from human impacts. Previous research on the weathering of San paintings has focused largely on either monitoring processes causing weathering in rock shelters or investigating rock surfaces that are adjacent to the rock paintings. Recent findings indicate that some of the San art has been painted onto surfaces that were prepared by smoothing the rock surface with a “grinding stone” and coated with a clay (“ground”) layer prior to the application of pigments. This new information may have important implications for rock art conservation as smoothing of a rock surface could significantly modify the physical and chemical characteristics of the surface, thereby influencing the deterioration of the art. In this study two classification systems are developed from data collected in four rock shelters situated in the Park. The first, a Type of Surface Classification System, is developed for the purpose of identifying different types of rock surfaces within rock shelters. The second, a State of Deterioration Classification System, is developed with the purpose of establishing, through visual inspection, how deteriorated the rock art on different types of rock surfaces is. Linkages between the type of surface and the state of deterioration are also explored. Findings show that it is not only possible to determine which surface type a painting has been painted on, but that different rock surface types can deteriorate through different weathering mechanisms and to a different degree. One type of rock surface, acknowledged but not yet recorded, was found amongst the rock art paintings selected {{for the purpose of this}} study. More importantly, the alteration of rock surfaces through human action in the past is found to cause rock surfaces to deteriorate either at an accelerated or a retarded rate as opposed to rock paintings that were made on surfaces that have only been altered by natural weathering mechanisms. For example, if a rock surface has only been <b>smoothed</b> with a <b>grinding</b> stone, results show that weathering mechanisms did not deteriorate the surface as quickly as in the case where a clay ground layer has been applied to the rock surface. Different types of rock surfaces deteriorating through different weathering mechanisms (as a result of surface preparation) might have significant implications in terms of rock art conservation as the strategies implemented to conserve rock art should be adapted to consider surface type. In terms of rock art studies aiming to conserve this precious heritage, the two classification systems presented could, therefore, be useful non-destructive tools in assessing rock art deterioration.
