500|$|During {{her time}} at the English court, Lehzen {{attracted}} attention outside of the royal household for her close relationship with Victoria. She was criticised for her influence with the queen, particularly from those who disliked German influences at court. Pamphlets, many released by the Tory party, complained of the [...] "stranger harboured in our country" [...] and the [...] "evil counsellors" [...] surrounding Victoria. One in particular, published as the Warning Letter to Baroness Lehzen, declared that a [...] "certain foreign lady pulled the wires of a diabolical conspiracy of which Lady Flora {{was to be the}} first victim," [...] a reference to the Flora Hastings affair. More positive, The Times once described her as having simply [...] "held a highly and <b>strictly</b> <b>confidential</b> situation about the person of the Sovereign." [...] As a sign of the perceived political influence she possessed, in 1838 false rumours suggested that Lehzen had been [...] "converted" [...] to the Whig party, and that she had been offered [...] "an urgent proposal of marriage" [...] by Whig prime minister Viscount Melbourne. Despite all of this criticism, historian Gillian Gill describes how Lehzen was honest and frugal; even after Victoria ascended the throne, she seems to have made no demands for money or rank, preferring instead to simply be in the queen's company. Historian K.D. Reynolds adds that Lehzen was a major influence on Victoria's character and moral development, in particular giving the queen the strength of will to survive her troubled childhood and young queenship. Not all of her influence was positive however; Reynolds also speculates that the 1839 Bedchamber crisis stemmed partly from Victoria's unwillingness to lose Lehzen.|$|E

Therefore, the orders, the circulars, the instructions, the <b>strictly</b> secret and <b>confidential</b> informing notes issued by the Police Office of Craiova and by the police organizations under its jurisdictional authority, throw even more light on the activity carried out by the Comitern and by its branch in Romania, the Romanian Communist Party, regarding not only the liquidation of Romania’s democratic regime and the setting up of the proletariat’s dictatorship, but also regarding the Soviet revisionism, which was claiming, throughout that period, the urgent separation of Bessarabia, and not only, from the Romanian state...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{formation}} of public organizations''domain perception', that is, their internal interpretation and external articulation of their role and its boundaries. The analysis is based on non-participant observation research of the UK Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), and archival research of its predecessor organization, which handled consumer complaints regarding the retail selling of financial products. I show that the FOS's articulation of its domain emphasized the <b>strictly</b> individual and <b>confidential</b> nature of its complaint handling, rather than formulation of general principles to guide firms' sale practices. This domain perception embodied an implicit exchange between the ombudsman and the retail financial industry on behalf of consumers, and distinguished the ombudsman's role {{from that of the}} Financial Services Authority and the civil courts. The case is employed as means for theory building regarding the nature of public organizations' domain perceptions and the process by which such constructs develop in regulatory contexts...|$|R

[...] The secrecy surrounding this group was such, that the Council members who were not involved in its deliberations were completely unaware of the study group's existence. It was divided into four functional topic groups: economic and financial, security and armaments, territorial, and political. The security and armaments group was headed by Allen Welsh Dulles who later became a pivotal figure in the CIA's predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services.

2500|$|Before postal {{workers were}} allowed to work, they had to pledge to uphold their integrity.

Everything at work was <b>strictly</b> <b>confidential.</b> In the past, there was no bank transfers available thus people often sent money by post using envelopes without using registered mail due to the higher cost incurred. Thus, it is extremely important that postal workers were honest and did not steal any items that went through the mail.

When asked what the recording process of her new album was like, Ciara made the following comments to Maxim magazine [...] "It's the coolest, can't lie. I go to the studio at, like, noon, and there's a lot of dancing and, of course, singing. There's a cook who whips up food, and we sit around and joke and record until the wee hours.

Ignoring reality TV offers, in autumn 2005, Jones starred in an ITV's detective drama series Vincent, with Ray Winstone in the title role; this was Jones's first television role since leaving Coronation Street the previous year. In the same year, she starred on the West End stage in A Few Good Men opposite Rob Lowe and John Barrowman, which earned her the Theatregoers' Choice Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also appeared in the musical special Celebrate Oliver! which was screened on BBC1. In 2006, she starred as Snow White in the pantomime Snow White and the Seven Dwarves at the Manchester Opera House alongside Justin Moorhouse and fellow Coronation Street actor John Savident. She also appeared in Kay Mellor's <b>Strictly</b> <b>Confidential</b> in which she played a bisexual sex therapist.|$|E
