50|$|As of 2012, several {{companies}} {{have started to}} offer <b>self-ballasted</b> metal-halide lamps as a direct replacement for incandescent and <b>self-ballasted</b> mercury-vapor lamps. These lamps include an arc tube with a starting electrode {{as well as a}} tubular halogen lamp which is connected in series and used to regulate the current in the arc tube. A resistor provides the current limiting for the starting electrode. Like <b>self-ballasted</b> mercury-vapor lamps, <b>self-ballasted</b> metal-halide lamps are connected directly to mains power and do not require an external ballast. In contrast to the former, these lamps usually have a clear outer bulb without a coating, making the arc tube and the halogen lamp tube clearly visible from the outside.|$|E
50|$|The mercury vapor lamp is a {{negative}} resistance device. This means its resistance decreases as the current through the tube increases. So if the lamp is connected directly to a constant-voltage source like the power lines, the current through it will increase until it destroys itself. Therefore, it requires a ballast to limit the current through it. Mercury vapor lamp ballasts {{are similar to the}} ballasts used with fluorescent lamps. In fact, the first British fluorescent lamps were designed to operate from 80-watt mercury vapor ballasts. There are also <b>self-ballasted</b> mercury vapor lamps available. These lamps use a tungsten filament in series with the arc tube both to act as a resistive ballast and add full spectrum light to that of the arc tube. <b>Self-ballasted</b> mercury vapor lamps can be screwed into a standard incandescent light socket supplied with the proper voltage.|$|E
5000|$|The arc-tube {{operates}} at anywhere from 5-50 atm or more (70-700 psi or 500-5000 kPa) and 1000-3000 °C. [...] Like all other gas-discharge lamps, metal-halide lamps have negative resistance (with the rare exception of <b>self-ballasted</b> lamps with a filament), and so require a ballast to provide proper starting and operating voltages while regulating the current {{flow through the}} lamp. About 24% of the energy used by metal-halide lamps produces light (an efficacy of 65-115 lm/W), making them substantially more efficient than incandescent bulbs, which typically have efficiencies in the range 2-4%.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{adapters}} between screw sizes, and for adapting {{to or from}} bayonet caps. A socket extender makes the bulb stick out further, such as to accommodate a compact fluorescent lamp with a <b>self-ballast</b> that doesn't fit in a recessed lighting fixture.|$|R

50|$|<b>Self-ballasted</b> (SB) lamps are mercury vapor lamps with a {{filament}} inside {{connected in}} series with the arc tube that functions as an electrical ballast. This is {{the only kind of}} mercury vapor lamp that should be connected directly to the mains without an external ballast. These lamps have only the same or slightly higher efficiency than incandescent lamps of similar size, but have a longer life. They give light immediately on startup, but usually needs a few minutes to restrike if power has been interrupted. Because of the light emitted by the filament, they have slightly better color rendering properties than mercury vapor lamps.|$|E
40|$|When {{dealing with}} solar home systems (SHS) one is often confronted with EMC problems. Charge {{regulators}} {{as well as}} <b>self-ballasted</b> lamps are concerned. They often disturb medium wave (AM) radio reception which is wide spread in developing countries. Unfortunately, the useful field strength in these countries is rather weak. Besides this, TV sets and other radio appliances can be disturbed. The work described in this paper aimed at investigating disturbance sources, coupling paths and possible filter measures {{on the basis of}} a variety of marketable charge regulators and <b>self-ballasted</b> lamps. A simple measuring procedure ensuring the EMC of these components will be presented. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract. The {{uniform and}} {{transparent}} nano-crystalline thin films of pure and co-doped with Fe 3 +/Sn 4 + titanium dioxide photo-catalysts were prepared via sol-gel dip-coating process, and were loaded {{firmly on the}} surface of glass substrates. The structure and surface morphology of films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). In particular, the photo-catalytic activity of films was measured by ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectrophotometer. Methyl orange was used as a model compound to study the photo-catalytic activity of films. The effects of the concentrations of doping ions and the number of layers on photo-catalytic degradation of methyl orange solutions were investigated. Experimental results showed clearly that the co-doping of iron and tin ions exhibited a synergistic effect, which increased significantly the photo-catalytic activity of titanium dioxide. Especially, the photo-catalytic activity of nano-crystalline titanium dioxide thin films co-doped with 0. 1 mol%Fe 3 + and 11. 41 mol%Sn 4 + was 2. 0 times higher than that of those un-doped for photo-degradation of methyl orange solutions under the 125 W <b>self-ballasted</b> fluorescent high-pressure mercury lamp irradiation...|$|E
40|$|Most nocturnal Lepidoptera can be {{attracted}} to artificial light sources, particularly to those that emit {{a high proportion of}} ultraviolet radiation. Here, I describe a newly developed LED lamp set for the use in the field that is lightweight, handy, robust, and energy efficient. The emitted electromagnetic spectrum corresponds to the peak sensitivity in most Lepidoptera eye receptors (ultraviolet, blue and green). Power LEDs with peaks at 368 nm (ultraviolet), 450 nm (blue), 530 nm (green), and 550 nm (cool white) are used. I compared the irradiance (Ee) of many commonly used light-trapping lamps at a distance of 50 cm. Between wavelengths of 300 and 1000 nm, irradiance from the new lamp was 1. 43 W m- 2. The new lamp proved to be the most energy efficient, and it emitted more radiation in the range between 300 and 400 nm than any other lamp tested. Cold cathodes are the second most energy-efficient lamps. Irradiation from fluorescent actinic tubes is higher than from fluorescent blacklight-blue tubes. High-wattage incandescent lamps and <b>self-ballasted</b> mercury vapour lamps have highest irradiance, but they mainly emit in the long wave spectrum. The use of gauze and sheets decreases the proportion of UV radiation and increases the share of blue light, probably due to optical brighteners. Compared with sunlight, UV irradiance is low at a distance of 50 cm from the lamp, but (safety) glasses as well as keeping sufficient distance from the lamp are recommended. In field tests, the new LED lamp attracted large numbers of Lepidoptera in both the Italian Alps and in the Peruvian Andes...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of its}} {{commitment}} to promoting and improving the local enforcement of appliance energy efficiency standards and labeling, the China National Institute of Standardization (CNIS) launched the National and Local Enforcement of Energy Efficiency Standards and Labeling project on August 14, 2009. The project’s short-term goal is to expand the effort to improve enforcement of standards and labeling requirements to the entire country within three years, with a long-term goal of perfecting overall enforcement. For this project, Jiangsu, Shandong, Sichuan and Shanghai were selected as pilot locations. This report provides information on the local enforcement project’s recent background, activities and results as well as comparison to previous rounds of check-testing in 2006 and 2007. In addition, the report also offers evaluation on the achievement and weaknesses in the local enforcement scheme and recommendations. The results demonstrate both improvement and some backsliding. Enforcement schemes are in place in all target cities and applicable national standards and regulations were followed {{as the basis for}} local check testing. Check testing results show in general high labeling compliance across regions with 100 % compliance for five products, including full compliance for all three products tested in Jiangsu province and two out of three products tested in Shandong province. Program results also identified key weaknesses in labeling compliance in Sichuan {{as well as in the}} efficiency standards compliance levels for small and medium three-phase asynchronous motors and <b>self-ballasted</b> fluorescent lamps. For example, compliance for the same product ranged from as low as 40 % to 100 % with mixed results for products that had been tested in previous rounds. For refrigerators, in particular, the efficiency standards compliance rate exhibited a wider range of 50 % to 100 %, and the average rate across all tested models also dropped from 96 % in 2007 to 63 %, possibly due to the implementation of newly strengthened efficiency standards in 2009. Areas for improvement include: Greater awareness at the local level to ensure that all manufacturers register their products with the label certification project and to minimize their resistance to inspections; improvement of the product sampling methodology to include representative testing of both large and small manufacturers and greater standardization of testing tools and procedures; and continued improvement in local enforcement efforts...|$|E
