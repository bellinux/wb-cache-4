5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E
25|$|At that point, {{the state}} police sought to {{interrogate}} Rabbi Berel Brennglass, leader of the town's Adath Israel synagogue. When asked about the allegations of ritual murder, Brennglass told {{the police and the}} town's mayor, who was present, that they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> for asking such questions. He expressed outrage that people believed such lies in the United States in the 20th century.|$|E

500|$|According to US Attorney Donald Washington, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{investigators}} {{found that the}} hanging of the nooses [...] "had all the markings of a hate crime". But, {{it could not be}} prosecuted as such since juveniles are rarely prosecuted in the federal system, and this offense did not meet departmental standards for charges to be brought. La Salle Parish District Attorney J. Reed Walters stated that Washington had found no federal statute under which the teens could be prosecuted, just as he had found no applicable state statute. Walters opined: [...] "The people that [...] <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of what they unleashed on this town." ...|$|E

Following a brief split in 2013, the couple broke up during X-Men: Days of Future Past in 2014. Also that year, {{she was one of}} the victims of the iCloud leaks of celebrity photos, during which nude pictures of her were leaked online. Emphasizing that the images were never meant to be public, Lawrence called the leak a [...] "sex crime" [...] and a [...] "sexual violation", adding that viewers of the images <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> at their part in a sexual offense. As of 2014, Lawrence lives in Beverly Hills, California. Since September 2016, she has been in a relationship with Darren Aronofsky, whom she met during the filming of Mother! ...|$|E

500|$|Greg Daniels, {{who wrote}} the script, {{received}} a nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards. Steve Carell had also submitted this episode for consideration for his nomination for Outstanding Lead in a Comedy Series. Daniels eventually lost to Jeffrey Richman and Steven Levitan of Modern Family for the episode [...] "Caught in the Act", while Carell lost to Jim Parsons of The Big Bang Theory. Office star Rainn Wilson expressed anger on Twitter at the Academy for these decisions, saying [...] "The world of TV <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of itself that Steve Carell never won an Emmy for Michael Gary Scott. Goodnight." [...] Former Office writer Michael Schur and director Paul Feig also criticized this choice with Schur calling it a [...] "goddamn fucking embarrassment".

500|$|In 2008, Beatty {{convinced}} cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki {{and film}} critic Leonard Maltin to make The Dick Tracy TV Special for Turner Classic Movies, which featured Beatty as Tracy having a retrospective interview with Maltin. Maltin explicitly asks the fictional Tracy if Warren Beatty is planning on making {{a sequel to}} the 1990 film and he responds that he's heard about that but Maltin needs to ask Beatty himself. By March 2009, Tribune was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and lawyers for the company began to declare their ownership of television and film rights to Dick Tracy. [...] "Mr. Beatty's conduct and wrongful claims have effectively locked away certain motion picture and television rights to the Dick Tracy property," [...] lawyers for Tribune wrote in a filing. Fields responded that it was [...] "a nuisance lawsuit by a bankrupt company and they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|True to his word, Buckner {{never again}} met Bradley {{in a joint}} debate. Rumors began to {{circulate}} that Buckner was afraid to meet Bradley in debate again, and Bradley did little to dispel these rumors. The Democrats were not completely united throughout the campaign, with prominent members of the party, including Milton J. Durham and State Senator Albert Seaton Berry, criticizing the Democratic record in the state. The Democratic Henderson Gleaner was also critical, opining [...] "We <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of ourselves." [...] Throughout the state, Bradley hammered {{the issue of the}} blind trust afforded the perennial Democratic officeholders, specifically calling for an examination of the treasury. Though Bradley lost the election by more than 16,000 votes, he made the best showing of any Republican gubernatorial candidate to that time and garnered strong support from the state's black voters. His concerns about the state treasury proved valid: When Buckner ordered an audit of the treasurer's books in 1888, Treasurer James [...] "Honest Dick" [...] Tate fled with $250,000 from the state treasury. He was never found.|$|E

500|$|On 20 October 2010, {{following}} a live BBC News at Six report outside Parliament covering the 2010 Spending Review, Robinson silently took the anti-war, anti-cuts placard {{that had been}} waved directly behind him throughout, broke it in two and stamped on it. Afterwards, another protester, who had climbed {{the steps of the}} gantry where the BBC were broadcasting to film the protest on a mobile phone, said: [...] "You <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of yourself, mate. Shame on you!" [...] Robinson replied [...] "I'm not remotely ashamed of myself. Why should I be ashamed of myself?" [...] He wrote in his blog afterwards: [...] "I lost my temper and I regret that. However, as I explained afterwards to the protesters who disrupted my broadcast, there are many opportunities to debate whether the troops should be out of Afghanistan without the need to stick a sign on a long pole and wave it in front of a camera". Some days later, Robinson read out a jokily ambiguous [...] "letter of apology" [...] on the comedy game show Have I Got News for You, broadcast on 4 November 2010.|$|E
500|$|Several NBA {{players and}} coaches said the brawl was the worst fight they had ever seen. Pacers fans began {{to refer to the}} team as [...] "the Thugs". Pistons CEO Tom Wilson later stated that Artest's action took away {{physical}} barriers, such as tables and benches, that normally separate fans and players, and Indianapolis Star reporter Mark Montieth claimed [...] that [...] "in a way, [...] provoked [...] passively by lying down". In the post-game commentary on ESPN's NBA Shootaround, ESPN's studio analysts laid the blame on the Pistons' fans instead of on the players. John Saunders of ESPN referred to the fans as [...] "a bunch of punks". [...] Tim Legler said that [...] "the fans crossed the line". Stephen A. Smith stated that [...] "They <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of themselves and some of them (the fans) should be arrested as far as I'm concerned". Their commentary prompted ESPN vice president Mark Shapiro to place calls to host Saunders, as well as analysts Legler, Smith, and Greg Anthony. Shapiro felt their commentary was biased. The following Tuesday, Shapiro stated, [...] "I wish the studio hadn't laid the blame solely {{on the backs of the}} fans Friday night." ...|$|E

2500|$|Krugman {{wrote in}} March 2013 that by {{neglecting}} public investment {{and failing to}} create jobs, we are doing far more harm to future generations than merely passing along debt: [...] "Fiscal policy is, indeed, a moral issue, and we <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of what we're doing to the next generation's economic prospects. But our sin involves investing too little, not borrowing too much." [...] Young workers face high unemployment and studies have shown their income may lag throughout their careers as a result.

2500|$|In 2010, base {{commander}} Colonel Ted Conrad {{provided a}} statement about the incident to Clarke. Conrad stated that [...] "We saw nothing that resembled Lieutenant Colonel Halt's descriptions either in the sky or on the ground" [...] and that [...] "We had people in position to validate Halt's narrative, {{but none of them}} could." [...] In an interview, Conrad criticised Halt for the claims in his affidavit, saying [...] "he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> and embarrassed by his allegation that his country and Britain both conspired to deceive their citizens over this issue. He knows better." [...] Conrad also disputed the testimony of Sergeant Jim Penniston, who claimed to have touched an alien spacecraft; he said that he interviewed Penniston at the time and he had not mentioned any such occurrence. Conrad also suggested that the entire incident might have been a hoax.|$|E

2500|$|Looking back on {{this period}} (in 1926), Milne {{observed}} that when he told his agent {{that he was going}} to write a detective story, he was told that what the country wanted from a [...] "Punch humorist" [...] was a humorous story; when two years later he said he was writing nursery rhymes, his agent and publisher were convinced he should write another detective story; and after another two years, he was being told that writing a detective story would be in the worst of taste given the demand for children's books. He concluded that [...] "the only excuse which I have yet discovered for writing anything is that I want to write it; and I should be as proud to be delivered of a Telephone Directory con amore as I <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> to create a Blank Verse Tragedy at the bidding of others." ...|$|E

Boogie Down Productions had manufactured a disagreement with the Juice Crew's MC Shan, releasing [...] "South Bronx" [...] and [...] "The Bridge is Over" [...] in reply to his [...] "The Bridge" [...] and [...] "Kill That Noise" [...] respectively. KRS-One considered Run-D.M.C. the epitome of rap music in 1984 and had begun to rap following their lead. He has also said that BDP's approach reflected {{a feeling that the}} early innovators like Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J were by 1986 tainted by commercial success and {{out of touch with the}} streets.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 September 1877 in Benalla, Kelly, while drunk, {{was arrested}} for riding over a {{footpath}} and locked-up for the night.

During the struggle Kelly's trousers were ripped off. Trying to get Kelly to submit and taking advantage of his torn trousers, the Irish-born Constable Thomas Lonigan, whom Kelly later murdered at Stringybark Creek, [...] "black-balled" [...] him (grabbed and squeezed his testicles). During the struggle, a miller walked in, and on seeing the behaviour of the police said [...] "You <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of yourselves." [...] He then tried to pacify the situation and induced Kelly {{to put on the}} handcuffs. Kelly was charged with being drunk and assaulting police, and fined ₤3 1s, which included damage to the uniforms.|$|E
