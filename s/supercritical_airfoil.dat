25|$|A <b>supercritical</b> <b>airfoil</b> is an airfoil designed, primarily, {{to delay}} the onset of wave drag on {{aircraft}} in the transonic speed range. Supercritical airfoils are characterized by their flattened upper surface, highly cambered aft section, and greater leading edge radius as compared to traditional airfoil shapes. The <b>supercritical</b> <b>airfoil</b> was invented and designed by NASA aeronautical engineer Richard Whitcomb in the 1960s. Testing successfully commenced on a United States Navy Vought F-8U fighter through wind tunnel results in 1971.|$|E
500|$|The wings on the 777 {{feature a}} <b>supercritical</b> <b>airfoil</b> design that is swept back at 31.6degrees and {{optimized}} for cruising at Mach0.83 (revised upward after flight tests to Mach 0.84). The wings {{are designed with}} increased thickness and a longer span than previous airliners, resulting in greater payload and range, improved takeoff performance, and a higher cruising altitude. The wings also serve as fuel storage, with longer-range models able to carry up to [...] of fuel. This capacity allows the 777-200LR to operate ultra-long-distance, trans-polar routes such as Toronto to Hong Kong. In 2013, a new wing made of composite materials was introduced for the upgraded 777X, with a wider span and design features based on the 787's wings.|$|E

A recent analytic method for predicting the aerodynamic characteristics of <b>supercritical</b> <b>airfoils</b> is described.

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was originally designed as the Mitsubishi MU-300 Diamond, an all-new, all-jet development to complement and slot above the Mitsubishi MU-2 and provide Mitsubishi Heavy Industries with their top-of-the-line corporate aircraft model (hence the name [...] "Diamond").

It is a small, low-winged twin-turbofan aircraft of all metal construction, flown by {{a crew of}} two pilots and accommodating eight passengers in a pressurised cabin. Its wings use a computer designed, <b>supercritical</b> <b>airfoil</b> in order to minimise drag. Its two Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D turbofans are mounted on the rear fuselage.|$|E

[...] Design studies were performed by Grumman Aerospace Corporation in collaboration with Gulfstream American Corporation. [...] Design of the Gulfstream III started with an effort to synthesize a completely new wing employing NASA <b>supercritical</b> <b>airfoil</b> sections and winglets. Optimization studies considering weight, drag, fuel volume, cost, and performance indicated that {{a substantial portion of}} the new wing benefit could be secured with modifications to the existing wing. As a result, the new wing concept was canceled and work began on design modifications that would retain the Gulfstream II wing box structure and trailing edge surfaces.|$|E
40|$|All the <b>supercritical</b> <b>airfoils</b> {{that have}} been {{designed}} 13; to date, to the best knowledge of the authors, have reflex camber. An airfoil with camber is not beneficial if it needs to operate at supersonic speeds as {{may be the case}} for combat aircraft. Also, an airfoil with camber produces excessive pitching moment, an undesirable feature for helicopter rotors. In view of the above factors, symmetric 13; <b>supercritical</b> <b>airfoils</b> which are shock-free at a design free stream Mach number and lift coefficient would be beneficial for application in combat aircraft and helicopter rotors.

Both the CYBER 205 and CRAY 2 supercomputers are utilized, with average computational speeds of about 18 and 16 microsec/gridpoint/iteration, respectively.

40|$|A {{survey of}} {{research}} relative to scale effects on <b>supercritical</b> <b>airfoils</b> has been conducted. The {{results of this}} survey indicated that Reynolds number scale effects {{have a significant impact}} on airfoil design and performance. Further, this impact is greater for <b>supercritical</b> <b>airfoils</b> than for conventional airfoils. It was found that low Reynolds number drag data could be extrapolated to high Reynolds number conditions provided the flow was attached and the pressure distribution shape did not change appreciably. Airfoil lift and pitching-moment data obtained at low Reynolds numbers cannot be extrapolated to full-scale values. Viscous theoretical transonic analysis methods currently under development will significantly improve the ability of the designer to account for scale effects. Boundary-layer manipulation in low Reynolds number facilities using natural transition or aft located transition strips to simulate high Reynolds number conditions was shown to be an uncertain test procedure and reliance should be made on high Reynolds number facilities if available...|$|R
