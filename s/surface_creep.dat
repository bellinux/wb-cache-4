Location errors were reduced to ~ 20 m horizontally and ~ 80 m vertically. The locations reveal a complex pattern of faulting with en echelon fault segments trending in toward the northwest, approximately parallel to the North American-Pacific plate boundary and en echelon, conjugate features trending to the northeast. The relocated seismicity is highly correlated with the mapped faults showing triggered surface slip in response to the EMC mainshock. Aftershocks are located between depths of 2 km and 11 km, consistent with previous studies of seismogenic thickness in the region. Three-dimensional analysis reveals individual and intersecting fault planes between 5 km and 10 km in the along-strike and along-dip directions. These fault planes remain distinct structures at depth, indicative of conjugate faulting, and do not appear to coalesce onto a through-going fault segment. Measurements of surface displacement along the Laguna Salada-West and East (LS-W and LS-E, respectively) branches reveal no triggered <b>surface</b> <b>creep</b> on either branch following the EMC mainshock. Approximately 2 mm of triggered <b>surface</b> <b>creep</b> was observed on the LS-W in response to the 14 June 2010 M 5. 7 Ocotillo earthquake, however no creep was measured along the LS-E.

40|$|International audienceSequences of {{earthquakes}} {{are commonly}} {{represented as a}} succession of periods of interseismic stress accumulation followed by coseismic and postseismic phases of stress release. Because the recurrence time of large earthquakes is often greater than the available span of space geodetic data, it has been challenging to monitor the evolution of interseismic loading in its entire duration. Here we analyze large data sets of surface deformation at different key episodes around the Cholame, Parkfield and creeping segments of the San Andreas Fault that show evidence of significant deceleration of fault slip during the interseismic period. We compare the average fault slip rates {{before and after the}} 2004 M(w) 6 Parkfield earthquake, in the 1986 - 2004 and 2006 - 2012 periods, respectively, avoiding 2 years of postseismic deformation after 2004. Using a combination of GPS data from the Plate Boundary Observatory, the Southern California Earthquake Center Crustal Motion Map and the Bay Area Velocity Unification networks and interferometric synthetic aperture radar from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) and Envisat satellites, we show that the area of coupling at the transition between the Parkfield and Cholame segments appears larger later in the interseismic period than it does earlier on. While strong plate coupling is uniform across the Parkfield and Cholame segments in the 1986 - 2004 period, creep occurs south of the 2004 epicenter after 2006, making segmentation of the San Andreas Fault south of Parkfield more clearly apparent. These observations indicate that analyses of surface deformation late in the earthquake cycle may overestimate the area of plate coupling. A fault <b>surface</b> <b>creeping</b> much below plate rate may in some case be a region that does not promote earthquake nucleation but ratherjust be at a slower stage of its evolution.

Archaeological sites along the Colorado River corridor in Grand Canyon National Park are eroding due to a variety of surficial processes. The nature of <b>surface</b> particle <b>creep</b> is difficult to quantify and managers of this sensitive landscape wish to know the rates of erosion in order to make timely decisions regarding preservation. In the first study, two scans of a single convex hillslope were collected over the span of 12 months {{through the use of a}} ground-based lidar instrument. The scans were used to track the movement of rock clasts. This study, with a relatively small data set, did not show the expected positive relations of creep rate to slope or clast size, but did not preclude the existence of these relations either. The remarkably irregular long profile of the Colorado River has inspired several questions about the role of knickpoint recession, tectonics, and bedrock in the landscape evolution of Grand Canyon and the region. Bedrock resistance to erosion has a fundamental role in controlling topography and surface processes. In this second study, a data set of bedrock strength data was compiled and presented, providing relations of bedrock strength to hydraulicdriving forces of the trunk Colorado River drainage. Results indicate that rock strength and topographic metrics are strongly correlated in the middle to lower reaches of the plateau drainage.
