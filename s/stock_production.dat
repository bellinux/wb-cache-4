500|$|Her {{next two}} roles were challenging. In Robert Siodmak's {{psychological}} thriller The Dark Mirror (1946), deHavilland played twin sisters Ruth and Terry Collinsone loving and normal, the other psychotic. In {{addition to the}} technical problems of showing her as two characters interacting with each other on screen at the same time, deHavilland needed to portray two separate and psychologically opposite people. While the film was not well received by criticsVariety said the film [...] "gets lost in a maze of psychological gadgets and speculation"deHavilland's performance was praised by Tony Thomas, who called her final scene in the film [...] "an almost frighteningly convincing piece of acting". In his review in The Nation, James Agee wrote that [...] "her playing is thoughtful, quiet, detailed, and well sustained, and since it is founded, as some more talented playing is not, in an unusually healthful-seeming and likable temperament, it is an undivided pleasure to see." [...] While appearing in a summer <b>stock</b> <b>production</b> of What Every Woman Knows in Westport, Connecticut, her second professional stage appearance, deHavilland began dating Marcus Goodrich, a Navy veteran, journalist, {{and author of the}} 1941 novel Delilah. They were married on August 26, 1946.|$|E
