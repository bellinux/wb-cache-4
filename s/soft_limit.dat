40|$|The {{existence}} of universal <b>soft</b> <b>limits</b> for gauge-theory and gravity amplitudes {{has been known}} for a long time. The properties of the <b>soft</b> <b>limits</b> have been exploited in numerous ways; in particular for relating an n-point amplitude to an (n − 1) -point amplitude by removing a soft particle. Recently, a procedure called inverse soft was developed by which “soft ” particles can be systematically added to an amplitude to construct a higher-point amplitude for generic kinematics. We review this procedure and relate it to Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten recursion. We show that all tree-level amplitudes in gauge theory and gravity up through seven points can be constructed in this way, as well as certain classes of NMHV gaugetheory amplitudes with any number of external legs. This provides us with a systematic procedure for constructing amplitudes solely from their <b>soft</b> <b>limits...</b>|$|R

We clarify the notion of an enhanced <b>soft</b> <b>limit</b> and use these to extend the scope of onshell recursion techniques for scalar EFTs. As an example, we perform a detailed study of theories with two power counting parameters, ρ 1 = 1 and ρ 2 = 2, that include the shift symmetric generalised galileons. We demonstrate that the minimally enhanced <b>soft</b> <b>limit</b> uniquely picks out the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) symmetry, including DBI galileons. For the exceptional <b>soft</b> <b>limit</b> we uniquely pick out the special galileon within the class of theories under investigation.

40|$|Consistency {{relations}} {{involving the}} <b>soft</b> <b>limit</b> of the (n + 1) -correlator functions {{of dark matter}} and galaxy overdensities have been recently obtained, thanks to the symmetries enjoyed by the Newtonian equations of motion describing the dark matter and galaxy fluids coupled through gravity. Via an appropriate change of coordinates, the symmetries allow {{to go to a}} frame where the zero mode and the first spatial gradient of the long and linear wavelength mode of the gravitational potential have been removed. In such a case, the response of the system on short scales is a uniform displacement leading to the vanishing of the correlators in the <b>soft</b> <b>limit</b> at the equal-time. In this paper, we show that equal-time consistency relations involving the <b>soft</b> <b>limit</b> of the (n + 1) -correlator functions of dark matter can be obtained if there is a well-defined relation between the linear growth factor D(a) and the abundance of dark matter Ω, dlnD(a) /dlna=Ωm 1 / 2.

Despite the absence of spatial infinity of the spatial slices, we find the adiabatic modes and their associated consistency relations in a toy universe with background topology R× S^ 2. Flat FRW universe adiabatic modes are recovered via taking the large radius limit R≫H^- 1, for which we are living in a small local patch of Hubble size on the sphere. It is shown that both dilation and translation adiabatic modes in the local patch are recovered by a global dilation on the sphere, acting at different places. Comment: 4 page...|$|E
