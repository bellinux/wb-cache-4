5|$|According to Madagascar {{historian}} Gwyn Campbell, {{the number}} of non-Merina who died in violent conflict during the military campaigns of Ranavalona and her predecessor Radama from 1816 to 1853 was estimated at about 60,000. Additionally, a considerable {{proportion of the population}} not killed in battle in the subjugated provinces eventually died from famine as a consequence of <b>scorched</b> earth policies. Deaths among the Merina soldiers engaged in military actions were also high, estimated at about 160,000 for the period 1820–1853. A further 25–50% of the queen's soldiers stationed in lowland areas were estimated to have died each year due to diseases such as malaria. Although prevalent in the coastal parts of the island, malaria was uncommon in the high-altitude zone around Antananarivo, and Merina soldiers possessed little natural resistance against it. An average of 4,500 soldiers died each year for the greater part of Ranavalona's reign, contributing to severe depopulation in Imerina.|$|E

Kroonland inaugurated IMM's winter New York – Miami service from December 1925 to March 1926, but was laid up in Hoboken, New Jersey, when IMM did not resume the Miami service the following year.

40|$|Relatively little {{quantitative}} {{information has been}} available {{on the effects of}} low-intensity fire (under-burning) on dwarf mistletoe. Here we summarize results from six operational prescribed under-burns in second-growth ponderosa pine in New Mexico (Conklin and Geils, in press). For 1585 trees on 14 plots, crown <b>scorch,</b> bole char, and DMR were significant predictors of post-burn survival in both logistic (3 -yr response) and proportional hazard models (over 6 to 10 yrs). Reduction in DMR on surviving trees (<b>scorch</b> pruning) increased linearly with increasing <b>scorch.</b> Reduction in average DMR (sanitation) was observed on 12 plots, and increased with increasing average <b>scorch</b> and mean DMR before fire. A sanitation model estimates that an area with an initial DMR of 3. 0 receiving 50 % average <b>scorch</b> will have a reduction in mean DMR of 0. 7. Longer-term monitoring indicates that burns generating 50 % average <b>scorch</b> should provide about 10 years of control. Results indicate that under-burning can be a useful tool for management of dwarf mistletoe, given sufficient fire intensity...|$|R

In 1604–1605, Shah Abbas I, concerned that the lands of Nakhichevan and the surrounding areas could potentially pass into Ottoman hands, decided to institute a <b>scorched</b> earth policy. He forced some 300,000 Armenians, including the Armenian population of Nakhichevan {{to leave their homes}} and move to the Persian provinces south of the Aras River. After the last 1826-1828 Russo-Persian War, Nakhichevan became part of Russia per the Treaty of Turkmenchay after Persia's forced ceding. Alexandr Griboyedov, the Russian envoy to Persia, reported that 1,228 Armenian families from Persia migrated to Nakhichevan, while prior to their migration there were 2,024 Muslim and 404 Armenian families living in the province.|$|E
