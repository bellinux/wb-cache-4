5|$|In 1970 Zappa met {{conductor}} Zubin Mehta. They {{arranged a}} May 1970 concert where Mehta conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic augmented by a rock band. According to Zappa, {{the music was}} mostly written in motel rooms while on tour with the Mothers of Invention. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> later featured in the movie 200 Motels. Although the concert was a success, Zappa's experience working with a symphony orchestra was not a happy one. His dissatisfaction became a recurring theme throughout his career; he often felt {{that the quality of}} performance of his material delivered by orchestras was not commensurate with the money he spent on orchestral concerts and recordings.|$|E
5|$|According to the prosecution's theory, {{the assassin}} shot Goebel from the {{secretary}} of state's office {{on the first floor}} of a building next to the state capitol. However, much of the testimony against the accused men was conflicting, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> later proven to be perjured. Most of the state's judges were Democratic supporters of Goebel and juries were packed with partisan Democrats. The appellate courts, however, were largely Republican, and the convictions returned by the lower courts were often overturned, with the cases being remanded for new trials. Howard was tried and convicted in September 1900, January 1902, and April 1903; his final appeal failed, and he was sentenced to life in prison. Powers was also convicted three times—in July 1900, October 1901, and August 1903; a fourth trial in November 1907 ended in a hung jury. In 1908, Powers and Howard were pardoned by Republican governor Augustus E. Willson. Months later, Willson also issued pardons for former governor Taylor and several others still under indictment. Despite the pardon, Taylor seldom returned to Kentucky; he became an insurance executive in Indiana and died there in 1928. Youtsey, the only defendant not to appeal his sentence, was paroled in 1916 and pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor James D. Black.|$|E
5|$|In May 1851 Metternich {{left for}} his Johannisberg estate, {{which he had}} last visited in 1845. That summer Metternich enjoyed the company of Prussian {{representative}} Otto von Bismarck. He also enjoyed a visit from Frederick William, though the King irritated Metternich by appearing to cultivate him as a tool against Schwarzenberg. In September Metternich returned to Vienna, entertained along the way by various German princes keen to entertain the focus of Prussian intrigue. Metternich was reinvigorated, dropped his nostalgia, and lived in the present {{for the first time}} in a decade. Franz Josef asked for his advice on numerous issues (though he was too headstrong to be much influenced by it), and both of the two emerging factions in Vienna courted Metternich; even Tsar Nicholas called on him during a state visit. Metternich was not keen on the new Foreign Minister, Karl Ferdinand von Buol but thought him sufficiently incompetent that he would be impressionable. Metternich's advice was of varying quality; nonetheless, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> usefully insightful, even in modern issues. Now deaf, Metternich wrote endlessly, particularly for an appreciative Franz Josef. He wanted Austrian neutrality in the Crimean War, though Buol did not. In the meantime Metternich's health was slowly failing, and he was a more peripheral figure after the death of his wife Melanie in January 1854. In a brief resurgence of energy in early 1856, he busied himself in arrangements for a marriage between his son Richard and his granddaughter Pauline (Richard's step-sister's daughter) and undertook more travel. The King of the Belgians came to visit, as did Bismarck, and on 16 August 1857 he entertained the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom. Buol, however, was growing more resentful of Metternich's advice, particularly about Italy. In April 1859 Franz Josef came to ask him about what should be done in Italy. According to Pauline, Metternich begged him not to send an ultimatum to Italy, and Franz Josef explained that such an ultimatum had already been sent.|$|E

25|$|During the Revolutionary War, the Wyoming Valley was {{an active}} battleground between the British and the Continentals (American Patriots). On July 3, 1778, a force of British soldiers, with the {{assistance}} of about 700 Indians, attacked and killed nearly 300 American Patriots (in present-day Wyoming). Connecticut Continentals (Patriots), led by Captain Jeremiah Blanchard and Lieutenant Timothy Keyes, held and maintained a fort in Pittstown (present-day Pittston City). On July 4, 1778 (one day after the Battle of Wyoming), a group of British soldiers took over the fortress and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> destroyed.

25|$|On {{the accusations}} of being docile, Mathieu writes in her {{autobiography}} {{that she and}} Johnny Stark understood each other.

She also writes that she was forbidden to read the press, and, having peeked at <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>was</b> content to follow that rule. Stark, of course, had a heavy hand in manipulating the press. Mireille writes that her mother was often surprised to read on the front page that she was engaged to someone famous, or {{was going to be in}} a movie by some famous director.

25|$|Fairfax {{had drawn}} up his army {{on the ridge}} a mile north of Naseby, {{although}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> behind the crest on the reverse slope. Ireton's wing of {{five and a half}} regiments of cavalry was on the left. The infantry under Sergeant-Major General Sir Philip Skippon was in the centre with five regiments in the front line and three in support. A forlorn hope of 300 musketeers was deployed to the front, and two companies of Colonel Edward Harley's regiment were in reserve. A Parliamentarian engraving of the battle shows 11 pieces of artillery, in the intervals between the infantry regiments. They played little part in the battle; their first salvoes went high, and the Royalist and Parliamentarian infantry were subsequently too closely engaged for the guns to be used. Cromwell's wing, with six and a half regiments of cavalry, was on the right.|$|E

Thomas Dolby wrote the film's songs, and chose the members of Cherry Bomb. Actress Lea Thompson performed her own singing for the role, although she states that the filmmakers were unsure {{as to whether they}} would keep her vocals in the final film. Thompson was required to learn choreography with the band and record the songs so they could be synchronized during filming. The final sequence, in which Cherry Bomb performs the film's title song, was shot in front of a live audience in an auditorium in San Francisco. The song was co-written by Dolby and George Clinton. Gale was choreographed to dance and play guitar as Howard. Dolby built a special guitar for Gale to use for rehearsal and filming.|$|E

Butler and Ponsonby eloped in 1778, to the relief of Ponsonby's family (concerned about their {{reputation}} had she run away with a man) to live together in Wales for 51 years and be thought of as eccentrics. Their story was considered [...] "the epitome of virtuous romantic friendship" [...] and inspired poetry by Anna Seward and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
