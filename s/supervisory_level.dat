Adopting the perspective of multi-level social exchanges within organizations, we develop a dual-level model with perceived organizational support and leader-member exchange as two major mediating mechanisms for the distinctive effects of transformational leadership behaviors on employees' trust in leadership at both top management and <b>supervisory</b> <b>levels,</b> respectively. The empirical evidence based on a sample of 357 Chinese employees and their supervisors supports the proposed model. Both theoretical and practical implications of our findings are discussed...|$|R

With its emphasis on insulating power and rapidly implementing self-enforcing economic incentives, the “depoliticization ” approach creates few changes in bank behavior and, indeed impedes investment in new capabilities at the bank and <b>supervisory</b> <b>levels.</b> The “deliberative restructuring ” approach fostered innovative, cost-effective monitoring structures for recapitalization, a strong supervisory system, and a stable, expanding banking sector...|$|R

40|$|Assertiveness is {{generally}} regarded as an acceptable, even mandatory, behavior {{for both men and}} women. Argumentativeness, a type of assertiveness, has been conceptualized as both desirable and constructive and linked with group leader-ship, better decision making, and enhanced credibility. Training in argumenta-tive skills has been encouraged for women, who are generally lower in argumentativeness than are men. However, research on women’s assertiveness has shown that an assertive speaking style is not always well received by males, the dominant management group. This study examines the relationship between argumentativeness and women’s <b>supervisory</b> <b>level</b> in organizations. <b>Supervisory</b> <b>level,</b> operationalized as the number of reporting levels of authority, indicates the organization’s acceptance of the employee’s communication effectiveness.

40|$|Measurement of {{workload}} is {{a technique}} to get information about the efficiency and effectiveness of an organizational unit, or office holders {{through a process of}} research and assessment. It is conducted by using job analysis, workload analysis or other management techniques. PT. Ultrajaya Milk Industry & Trading Co., Tbk is manufacturer of the food and beverage. The company is always trying {{to meet the needs of}} consumers by creating products with high quality and competitive price. The high stress level perceived by Managerial Level and <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Level</b> become an important reason for the Department of Ultra High Temperature (UHT) to conduct workload analysis. By measuring the employees workload, it will be known whether the workload of an employee is optimal load or overload. This situation will affect the human-performance (employee). Based on calculations by the DRAWS method is yielded the average workload score for Managerial Level of 67. 37 % (in the overload category), while the dominant workload variable in Central Demand (CD) is 41. 60 %, the distribution of the mental workload is 72. 60 % and physical workload is 27. 40 %. While for <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Level</b> is yielded the average workload score of 64. 59 % (in the overload category)), where the dominant workload variable in Central Demand (CD) is 33. 63 %, the distribution of the mental workload is 55. 10 % and physical workload is 44. 90 %. Therefore the perceived mental workload of <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Level</b> is still relatively comparable compared to physical workload, and in contrast to the perceived Managerial Level which is dominated by mental workload...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{medical costs}} have made {{healthcare}} organizations look at reducing their operating costs while meeting their demands, which made them move towards adopting systems improvement methodologies {{that have been}} successful in other business sectors, especially from manufacturing industries. The success of these improvement methodologies is contingent on employees of the organization being ready to adopt and embrace them which necessitates behavior change of employees. This study aimed to develop measures based on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to assess employees’ attitudes and readiness to adopt improvement methodologies and the effects of employees’ demographics like <b>supervisory</b> <b>level,</b> length of service, work group and age on the adoption process. The study was conducted at the Providence VA Medical Center (PVAMC) which is trying to implement improvement methodologies. All employees were surveyed five times over a period of two and half years using TTM measures. Exploratory factor analysis indicated an 8 -item single factor structure for self-efficacy and a 2 -factor 16 item structure for decisional balance. An additional set of survey questions related to processes of change scale did not produce a reliable factor structure to be used for hypothesis testing. The results indicated that self-efficacy, which is the confidence to adopt improvement methodologies, did predict the stage of change with low confidence in pre-contemplation compared to maintenance. The study did not find support that decisional balance, which is the perception of pros and cons, influences the stage of change. Employees’ length of service, <b>supervisory</b> <b>level</b> and work group influenced the stage of change, and length of service and <b>supervisory</b> <b>level</b> influenced self-efficacy measure while age of employee affected self-efficacy. ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} few years, the {{financial}} industry has been characterised by an ongoing cross-sector and cross-border consolidation of financial institutions spanning banking, securities, and insurance institutions and the blurring demarcation of their respective products and instruments.

40|$|English as a {{tool for}} {{communication}} in the globalized world has lead to the need to shift the focus of the teaching orientation. The teaching of English should shift from General English (GE) to Specific English (SP).

40|$|In Malaysia, Shar¥cah {{scholars}} at the <b>supervisory</b> <b>levels</b> {{have advocated}} bayc al-c¥nah as {{a mode of}} finance. Under the label of al-bayc, the contract of al-bayc al-c¥nah contains interest-bearing features, such as earning a contractual return without the implication of risk and value-addition. Seeking a broader consensus on the permissibility of bayc al-c¥nah is thus critical. This study shows that Malaysian Shar¥cah scholars outside the supervisory bodies do not fully support al-bayc al-c¥nah. The survey indicates that bayc al-c¥nah can be applied under a state of èar´rah or when the ma§laúah of the Muslim people is under threat, which is not the case in Malaysia. Since Shar¥cah scholars in Middle-Eastern countries have condemned bayc al-c¥nah, it is crucial that a diversification policy is pursued to invite greater participation of global Islamic funds in Malaysia.

40|$|Orientation: The role {{of traits}} as a {{determinant}} of states {{has resulted in}} researchers closely examining their potential for enhancing work behaviour. This is achieved through {{the examination of the}} trait and state perspectives. Research purpose: This research sought to determine the relationship between work locus of control (WLOC) and psychological capital (PsyCap), with the objective of increasing alertness on the trait and state approach. Motivation for the study: The current study investigated the role of traits and states in contributing to the positive psychology arena within the recruitment industry. Research approach, design and method: This longitudinal research design involved 425 middle managers at Time 1 (T 1), at both <b>supervisory</b> and specialist <b>levels,</b> and 190 middle managers at <b>supervisory</b> <b>levels</b> at Time 2 (T 2). This longitudinal study used a biographical, WLOC and PsyCap questionnaires. Main findings: The findings indicated that WLOC has predictive value for PsyCap: a statistically significant and practical relationship was established between WLOC and PsyCap at T 1 and T 2. However, the multiple regression analysis results were not consistently demonstrated over time. Practical managerial implications: Understanding the role of personality traits and psychological states can provide managers with additional means of increasing employee efficiency through improving work processes such as recruitment and selection. Contributions/value-add: The recruitment and other industries are encouraged to utilise a strength-based approach to enhance work performance through selection processes that incorporate traits and states to further increase organisational competitiveness. </p...|$|R
