40|$|For six decades, China’s central {{authorities}} have promoted development in ethnic regions through <b>special</b> <b>fiscal</b> allocations {{with the idea}} that economic development is the key to national integration and inter-ethnic harmony. Yet, inter-ethnic tensions and violence persist in China. Focusing on historical changes to fiscal allocations as the principal policy instrument used by Beijing to promote development in ethnic areas, this analysis finds these changes mirror broad shifts in the country’s national development strategy. As the study argues, this pattern reflects an approach to development policy in ethnic regions whereby policies serve central objectives consistent with a policy process for determining the fiscal allocations to ethnic regions that has been both centrally concentrated and non-participatory. With evidence that this “non-engaging” approach may be exacerbating ethnic tensions, Beijing has made efforts to introduce more “inclusive” approaches to determining policies for ethnic regions; however, whether these approaches will be institutionalized remains unclear...|$|R

This {{was the first}} part of fiscalization, which includes creation of Fiscal Journal (FJ) which have to be saved at each POS, central database or in Cloud. The second part of the new fiscal law is the digital signature of every cash receipt, which will be implemented on 1 April 2017.Austrian fiscal regulation is based on two concepts. First concept relates to usage of digital signature device for every issued receipt and second to „closed system“ in which independent audit of Company processes and organization is needed. „Closed system“ refers to the company that has more than 30 cash registers. But there is one difference between these two concepts - usage of digital signature device and registration of each POS at Fiscal Authority what is not mandatory when we talk about „closed system“. Advantages of “closed system” are: signature device, digital certificate and POS registration at authority are not needed.With the new regulations fiscal law in Austria requires that every POS has unique number, that has to create and maintain the fiscal totals (created by adding every cash turnover to previews one encoded with AES 256 algorithm).

40|$|East European {{industry}} is making radical adjustments {{as a result}} of the transition to a market economy. After some four decades of centrally planned development geared to large-scale production for a relatively undemanding Comecon network, private domestic entrepreneurs now have access to a global market. But there are major constraints, notably through the difficulty in raising capital at sustainable rates of interest. Consequently foreign direct investment (FDI) is of crucial importance both for the restructuring of old industries and for the development of new projects with export potential. However, FDI is highly uneven, both within and between countries, and it is important to consider the reasons for this discrimination. The author discusses the location decisions of foreign companies, especially with regard to the large urban centres which are attracting the bulk of the investment. Reference is made to urban entrepreneurialism, industrial estates and <b>special</b> <b>fiscal</b> regimes, infrastructure, and environmental quality. Although some cities are particularly well endowed, most have only limited strengths to highlight as trade-offs against deficiencies. The question therefore arises as to whether all cities and their regions can exploit their strengths [...] and make positive use of spatial unevenness [...] to restructure their industrial sectors and provide gateways into the rural areas. Here there are both positive and negative views. Optimists see good prospects over the longer term through overspill and `trickling down' through East Central Europe and indeed the Confederation of Independent States, whereas pessimists doubt whether even the more successful cities can attract sufficient FDI and generate enough indigenous small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) to eliminate unemployment and deliver growing prosperity. ...|$|R

Currently, about 15 percent of U. S. school children are classified as "disabled.

I use the experiences following a major reform of the special education funding system in California to examine this issue. Between 1996 and 1998, the state converted from a system that awarded funds {{based on the number of}} students classified as disabled in a district (with funding rates that varied across districts) to one based on total enrollment. This reform induced changes in the total funding awarded to different districts and also reduced the marginal revenue from classifying an additional student as disabled to zero.
