They stress the importance of maintaining the Open Source Definition. This trademark creates a trusted group that connects all users and developers together. To fully understand the Open Source Definition, one must understand certain terms: Free redistribution means that there is no restriction on any party to sell or give away the software to third parties. Source Code means that the program must efficiently publicize the means of obtaining the source code. Derived works means that the program must allow certain works to be distributed under the same terms. There must be a promise of no discriminating against any certain persons or groups. All of these factors allow for the open source movement to become available to all and easy to access, which is their overall mission.The latest updates from the Open <b>Source</b> <b>Institution</b> took place on January 19, 2011: The OSI collaborated with the Free Software Foundation and together they updated a version of the request that they have sent to the US Department of Justice.|$|E

At Datamonitor, a provider of online data, analytic and forecasting platforms for key vertical sectors, we believe that the role of OSS will become increasingly important in education. The solutions available are becoming more sophisticated and stable. Currently, 56 % of education institutions are using OSS and open source is clearly making headway into the education market. Furthermore, {{there are a number of}} varying factors driving institutions towards OSS and not all institutions are implementing OSS for the same reason. OSS offers an alternative method through which an institution can implement a technological solution, along with it's own variety of benefits and pitfalls. However, the increased popularity of OSS will not prevent proprietary software solutions from having an important role to play in education. Instead, OSS and proprietary solutions are going to become even more entwined together and the line between open source and proprietary solutions will blur...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{accuracy}} and transferability of Bayesian case detection systems (BCD) that use clinical notes from emergency department (ED) to detect influenza cases. A BCD uses {{natural language processing}} (NLP) to infer {{the presence or absence}} of clinical findings from ED notes, which are fed into a Bayesain network classifier (BN) to infer patients' diagnoses. We developed BCDs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (BCDUPMC) and Intermountain Healthcare in Utah (BCDIH). At each site, we manually built a rule-based NLP and trained a Bayesain network classifier from over 40, 000 ED encounters between Jan. 2008 and May. 2010 using feature selection, machine learning, and expert debiasing approach. Transferability of a BCD in this study may be impacted by seven factors: development (<b>source)</b> <b>institution,</b> development parser, application (target) institution, application parser, NLP transfer, BN transfer, and classification task. We employed an ANOVA analysis to study their impacts on BCD performance. Both BCDs discriminated well between influenza and non-influenza on local test cases (AUCs > 0. 92). When tested for transferability using the other institution's cases, BCDUPMC discriminations declined minimally (AUC decreased from 0. 95 to 0. 94, p< 0. 01), and BCDIH discriminations declined more (from 0. 93 to 0. 87, p< 0. 0001). We attributed the BCDIH decline to the lower recall of the IH parser on UPMC notes. The ANOVA analysis showed five significant factors: development parser, application institution, application parser, BN transfer, and classification task. We demonstrated high influenza case detection performance in two large healthcare systems in two geographically separated regions, providing evidentiary support for the use of automated case detection from routinely collected electronic clinical notes in national influenza surveillance. The transferability could be improved by training Bayesian network classifier locally and increasing the accuracy of the NLP parser...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: There {{exists a}} growing {{consensus}} that career flexibility {{is critical to}} recruiting and retaining talented faculty, especially women faculty. This {{study was designed to}} determine both accessibility and content of work-life policies for faculty at leading medical schools in the United States. Methods: The sample includes the top ten medical schools in the United States published by U. S. News and World Report in August 2006. We followed a standardized protocol to collect seven work-life policies at each school: maternity leave, paternity leave, adoption leave, extension of the probationary period for family re-sponsibilities, part-time faculty appointments, job sharing, and child care. A review of information provided on school websites was followed by e-mail or phone contact if needed. A rating system of 0 – 3 (low to high flex-ibility) developed by the authors was applied to these policies. Rating reflected flexibility and existing opin-ions in published literature. Results: Policies were often difficult to access. Individual scores ranged from 7 to 15 out of a possible 21 points. Extension of the probationary period received the highest cumulative score across schools, and job sharing re-ceived the lowest cumulative score. For each policy, there were important differences among schools. Conclusions: Work-life policies showed considerable variation across schools. Policy information is difficult to access, often requiring multiple <b>sources.</b> <b>Institutions</b> that develop flexible work-life policies that are widely pro-moted, implemented, monitored, and reassessed are likely at an advantage in attracting and retaining faculty while advancing institutional excellence. 131...|$|R
