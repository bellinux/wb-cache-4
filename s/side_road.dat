5|$|Throughout July and August 1944, Kesselring {{fought a}} {{stubborn}} delaying action, gradually retreating to the formidable Gothic Line north of Florence. There, {{he was finally}} able to halt the Allied advance. Casualties of the Gothic Line battles in September and October 1944 included Kesselring himself. On 25 October 1944, his car collided with an artillery piece coming out of a <b>side</b> <b>road.</b> Kesselring suffered serious head and facial injuries and did not return to his command until January 1945.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, {{traffic was}} {{struggling}} {{along the narrow}} streets south of Holbein Gate, which led to King Street Gate being demolished in 1723. Holbein Gate, in turn, was demolished in 1759. Meanwhile, Parliament Street was a <b>side</b> <b>road</b> alongside the palace, leading to the Palace of Westminster. After the Palace of Whitehall was destroyed, Parliament Street was widened to match Whitehall's width. The present appearance of the street dates from 1899 after a group of houses between Downing Street and Great George Street were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{section of}} Highway58 begins at a junction {{with the former}} Highway3 {{in the city of}} Port Colborne, several kilometres north of Lake Erie. South of this intersection, the road once continued as Niagara Regional Road 64 to Killaly Street; such has since been downloaded to the city of Port Colborne. Proceeding north, the highway, known locally as West <b>Side</b> <b>Road,</b> passes through the suburbs of Port Colborne, north of which it skirts {{the eastern edge of the}} Wainfleet Bog, one of the few remaining habitats of the Massasauga Rattlesnake.|$|E

5|$|Around an {{hour after}} the start of the race, three {{children}} were struck by car driven by one of the race officials on a <b>side</b> <b>road</b> from Quarter Bridge Road, near the finish line. None sustained serious injuries; two of them had cuts dressed, while the third rushed back to watching the racing. Another, more serious, accident occurred on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which had been transporting people up the mountain to watch the racing. A tramcar that had been descending the railway had broken down, and a second car had stopped close behind it. A third tram, on rounding the bend above them, was unable to stop in time and collided into the rearmost car, which was then propelled into {{the car in front of}} it. Minor injuries were sustained by some of the passengers, though none were serious.|$|E
25|$|The Porsche 911 Turbo hit an {{oncoming}} Volkswagen Golf, which {{was making a}} left turn on to the main road from a <b>side</b> <b>road</b> and driving {{in the opposite direction}} of the Porsche. The Porsche hit the Golf head-on, and the crash pushed both vehicles off the road.|$|E

25|$|Bryant {{fired at}} some people {{hiding in a}} bush, but missed. Having seen the murders of the children, some people further up the road began running. They told drivers of cars coming {{down the road to}} go back. The people thought Bryant would head up the road, so instead they {{proceeded}} on foot down a dirt <b>side</b> <b>road</b> and hid in the bush. The cars reversed up the road to the toll booth.|$|E
25|$|The AA Highway is a rural two-lane highway {{for most}} of its length and {{traverses}} through some desolate terrain. Driver inattention and speeding, in combination with the numerous <b>side</b> <b>road</b> entrances and at-grade intersections have made it a dangerous and deadly road. To address these issues, guide signs comparable to interstate-styled signs have been installed along the highway at major intersections, along with additional overhead lighting. Other measures to improve safety and increase capacity are under consideration.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, SR 86 {{had a rather}} notorious {{reputation}} for frequent and often fatal collisions. For much of its length, especially between {{the southern tip of}} the Coachella Valley to the Imperial County line, SR 86 was a two-lane road with easy access from rural <b>side</b> <b>roads.</b> A driver trying to pass might find himself headed straight for the side of another vehicle pulling out from one of the <b>side</b> <b>roads.</b> This reputation earned SR 86 the nickname [...] "Blood Alley".|$|R
25|$|In 2001, the Crum {{segment of}} the Tolsia Highway opened to traffic. The highway begins just north of Crum at an {{incomplete}} diamond interchange and heads eastward towards CR2. It has at-grade intersections with CR52-47 and CR52-31 along with a <b>side</b> <b>road</b> at the eastern terminus that takes traffic to CR2. There are stubs for future bridges and ramps. Signage along this segment is minimal, with {{only a handful of}} arrows to designate the route. While the highway was built to four-lane standards, it is only striped for two.|$|E
25|$|The rock-art site {{is located}} along the E.N.370 {{motorway}} between Santiago do Escoural and Alto da Abaneja, approximately five kilometres from the latter. A <b>side</b> <b>road</b> towards the east, {{in the direction}} of Herdade da Sala, in the locality of Fonte Nova, directs the traveller to a marble outcropping and cliff face embedded in igneous rock, on which the archaeological site is found. It is in an isolated rural location between the Tagus River and Sado River basins and the plains region of the Alentejo, near other important megalithic monuments, including the Cromolech of Almendres and the dolmen Anta Grande do Zambujeiro.|$|E
25|$|MD 468 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with West Shady <b>Side</b> <b>Road,</b> which heads north toward the Capt. Salem Avery House, and Snug Harbor Road, which heads east toward Snug Harbor Park and the Idlewilde peninsula. The highway heads south as two-lane Shady <b>Side</b> <b>Road.</b> MD 468 gradually curves {{to the west}} and meets the eastern end of MD 256 (Deale Churchton Road) as the highway passes north of the hamlet of Churchton. The highway continues west as Muddy Creek Road and intersects Sudley Road, which provides access to the historic home Sudley. MD 468 gradually curves to the north and crosses three streams that flow into the West River. The highway intersects MD 255 adjacent to the Quaker Burying Ground; the highway heads east as Galesville Road into the namesake village and west as Owensville Road. MD 468 passes to the west of three historic homes: Tulip Hill, which is accessed directly from the route; and Cedar Park and Parkhurst. After passing Old Muddy Creek Road, an old alignment, the road crosses over several branches of Muddy Creek within the Birds Mill Swamp. After leaving the swamp, the road passes Contee Wharf Road and South River Clubhouse Road. The former road leads east to the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center and the latter passes the historic meeting place of the South River Club. After passing another old alignment of MD 468 in Clydesdale Road, the road meets its northern terminus at MD 214 (Central Avenue) on the southeastern edge of Edgewater.|$|E
5000|$|After leaving Seven Fields, drivers enter Adams Township. Although {{this stretch}} of roadway isn't highly {{developed}} like the neighboring Cranberry Township and Seven Fields portions are, traffic is still a problem. This is because local residents use {{this stretch of}} road to commute locally (to Cranberry) or {{to the city of}} Pittsburgh via I-79 or US Route 19. This large traffic volume issue is further compounded by the numerous <b>side</b> <b>roads</b> that are well traveled. Many of Rt. 228's intersections with <b>side</b> <b>roads</b> do not have turning lanes or traffic signals. Often drivers have to wait a considerable amount of time to turn onto a <b>side</b> <b>roads</b> because of heavy traffic volume during rush hour. This leads to backlogs in traffic since vehicles have to sit {{for long periods of time}} in the only travel lane waiting to turn, and other motorists cannot pass said stopped vehicle.|$|R

25|$|In 1966, it was redefined {{to consist}} of the part of Metropolitan Toronto bounded by a line drawn from Eglinton Avenue West, north along Jane Street, east along Lawrence Avenue West, north along the C.N.R. line, west along Highway 401, north along Keele Street, west along Calvington Drive, {{northwest}} along Exbury Road, north along Jane Street, west along Sheppard Avenue West, north along Highway 400, west along Steeles Avenue West, south along {{the boundary between the}} Townships of Etobicoke and Toronto, southeast along the West Branch of the Humber River, south along Kipling Avenue North, east along Rexdale Boulevard, south along Islington Avenue North, east along Dixon <b>Side</b> <b>Road,</b> southeast along the Humber River, and east Eglinton Avenue West to Jane Street.|$|E
25|$|Since the incident, the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management has {{installed}} additional numerous large {{signs on the}} approaches to Bear Camp Road, warning that the road may be impassable during winter months. Also, the directional sign ("To Gold Beach and Coast") {{at the spot where}} the Kims turned onto the wrong road, has been moved and replaced. At the spot, the through road is narrow and steeply uphill while the <b>side</b> <b>road</b> is much wider and more level and appears to be the proper continuation. The location and arrow direction on the old sign was confusing and ambiguous, especially in snow when {{it would be impossible to}} see that the narrow uphill road is the correct route while the wide level road is not.|$|E
25|$|With its ancestry {{going back}} to the horse bus days of the 1880s, Chelverton Road Garage was {{converted}} to a motor-bus garage in 1912. The garage is well hidden in a <b>side</b> <b>road</b> with a modest frontage, yet it has an allocation of 112. It has been modernised twice, firstly in 1935 and then again in 1985. The garage was well known for being allocated the pre-war RTs in 1940 which displaced the STLs. During the war the garage was underutilised and was used to store de-licensed buses. Renamed Putney in 1963 after the closure of Putney Bridge garage (F) it started to receive both short and long wheelbase AEC Routemasters for its central London routes. The Routemasters remained at the garage until July 2005 when both the 14 and 22 were converted to low floor one-person-operated buses.|$|E
