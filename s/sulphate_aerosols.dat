After 1970 our model with greenhouse gases alone begins to depart significantly from the observations. However, when we included <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosols,</b> which have a cooling effect, the model agreed with the data from the 1930s and onwards.

The multi-component physico-chemical parameterisation indicates a significantly reduced role for the sulphate CCN in cloud droplet nucleation and suggests that the contribution of <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> to indirect radiative forcing is significantly less than previously estimated.

40|$|<b>Sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> {{injection}} {{has been}} widely discussed as a possible way to engineer future climate. Monitoring it would require detecting its effects amidst internal variability and {{in the presence of}} other external forcings. We investigate how the use of different detection methods and filtering techniques affects the detectability of <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> geoengineering in annual-mean global-mean near-surface air temperature. This is done by assuming a future scenario that injects 5 [*]Tg[*]yr− 1 of sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere and cross-comparing simulations from 5 climate models. 64 % of the studied comparisons would require 25 years or more for detection when no filter and the multi-variate method that has been extensively used for attributing climate change are used, while 66 % of the same comparisons would require fewer than 10 years for detection using a trend-based filter. This highlights the high sensitivity of <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> geoengineering detectability to the choice of filter. With the same trend-based filter but a non-stationary method, 80 % of the comparisons would require fewer than 10 years for detection.

We present a set of vertical profiles of <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> volume densities and derived liquid-phase H 2 SO 4 mole-fractions for 2005 – 2012, retrieved from infrared limb emission measurements by the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) on board of the Environmental Satellite.

The MIPAS data of stratospheric <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> is linked to MIPAS observations of sulphur dioxide (SO 2) with the help of Chemical Transport Model simulations. We investigate the production of <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> and its fate from volcanically emitted SO 2 for two volcanic case studies: the eruptions of Kasatochi in 2008 and Sarychev in 2009, which both occurred in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes during boreal summer.

Further, we demonstrate that the lifetime of SO 2 is well described by its oxidation by hydroxyl radicals. While sedimentation of the <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> plays a role, we find that the dominant mechanism controlling the stratospheric lifetime of sulphur after these volcanic eruptions at mid-latitudes is transport in the Brewer-Dobson circulation. Sulphur emitted by the two mid-latitude volcanoes resides mostly north of 30 ° N at altitudes of ~  10 – 16  km, while at higher altitudes (~  18 – 22  km) part of the volcanic sulphur is transported towards the equator where it is lifted into the stratospheric overworld and can further be transported into both hemispheres...|$|R

5000|$|Climate {{engineering}} poses several {{challenges in}} the context of governance because of issues of power and jurisdiction. Climate engineering as a climate change solution differs from other mitigation and adaptation strategies. Unlike a carbon trading system that would be focused on participation from multiple parties along with transparency, monitoring measures and compliance procedures; this is not necessarily required by climate engineering. Bengtsson (2006) argues that [...] "the artificial release of <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosols</b> is a commitment of at least several hundred years". Yet this is true only if a long-term deployment strategy is adopted. Under a short-term, temporary strategy, implementation would instead be limited to decades. Both cases, however, highlight the importance for a political framework that is sustainable enough to contain a multilateral commitment over such a long period and yet is flexible as the techniques innovate through time. There are many controversies surrounding this topic and hence, climate engineering has been made into a very political issue. Most discussions and debates are not about which climate engineering technique is better than the other, or which one is more economically and socially feasible. Discussions are broadly on who will have control over the deployment of climate engineering and under what governance regime the deployment can be monitored and supervised. This is especially important due to the regional variability of the effects of many climate engineering techniques, benefiting some countries while damaging others. The challenge posed by climate engineering is not how to get countries to do it. It is to address the fundamental question of who should decide whether and how climate engineering should be attempted - a problem of governance.|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of aerosols on climate, the Northern Aerosol Regional Climate Model (NARCM) is currently being developed. NARCM includes size-segregated aerosols as prognostic and interactive constituents. In this paper, the model is being applied to <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> over North America during time periods in July and December 1994. The results give evidence for considerable regional and seasonal variations in <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> size distributions over North America. Comparisons of the results with different observations yield a reasonably good agreement in terms of meteorological and physicochemical parameters. Some {{of the differences in}} sulphate concentrations and wet deposition rates can be attributed to differences in cloud amounts and precipitation between model results and observations. Indirect tests of the simulated aerosol mass mean diameters are also encouraging. Additional simulations for hypothetical decreases in anthropogenic sulphur emissions and increases in hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) background concentrations are performed for the same time periods to study the responses of concentration, size distribution, and wet deposition of <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> to these changes. Also, responses of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) number concentrations are investigated. The simulation results show that <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> concentrations respond almost linearly in both time periods to decreases in sulphur emissions but that CCN number concentrations respond nonlinearly due to decreases in sulphate mass mean diameters. Especially for the December period, increases in hydrogen peroxide background concentrations lead to increases in CCN number concentrations at critical diameters larger than about 0. 07 μm. These results lead to the hypothesis that increased in-cloud oxidation in convective clouds due to future increases in oxidant concentrations may produce larger CCN which eventually can be easily activated in subsequently forming stratiform clouds...|$|R

40|$|A global chemistry-transport {{model has}} been used to study the effect of {{shipping}} emissions on air quality and ecosystems over Europe, through changes in surface ozone and surface <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosols,</b> and changes in the deposition of sulphur and oxidised nitrogen. Scenarios are chosen to determine the impact of current (2000) shipping emissions, and the combined impact of changes in land-based and shipping emissions by 2030. The effects of shipping on ozone are small, compared to land-based emissions changes, and can be both positive and negative. Due to the non-linear nature of ozone chemistry, the effects of shipping depend on the magnitude of the emission change, and on the choice of scenario for the land-based emissions. The effects on sulphate aerosol levels and deposition fluxes of <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosols</b> and oxidised nitrogen species are larger, and are comparable to expected changes in land-based emissions. This is particularly true for SO 2 emissions from shipping. SO 2 has a sufficiently short lifetime that most of the impacts are felt within the European region, although much of that is over the sea. The increase in <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosols</b> and sulphur deposition due to the SO 2 from shipping will offset 75 % of the benefits in air quality that would be expect from land-based emission controls under the SRES A 2 scenario...|$|E

40|$|Aerosols {{are known}} to {{influence}} significantly the radiative budget of the Earth. Although the direct effect (whereby aerosols scatter and absorb solar and thermal infrared radiation) has a large perturbing influence on the radiation budget, the indirect effect (whereby aerosols modify the microphysical and hence the radiative properties and amounts of clouds) poses a greater challenge to climate modellers. This is because aerosols undergo chemical and physical changes while in the atmosphere, notably within clouds, and are removed largely by precipitation. The way in which aerosols are processed by clouds depends on the type, abundance and the mixing state of the aerosols concerned. A parametrization with <b>sulphate</b> and sea-salt <b>aerosol</b> has been successfully integrated within the Hadley Centre general circulation model (GCM). The results of this combined parametrization indicate a significantly reduced role, compared with previous estimates, for <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> in cloud droplet nucleation and, consequently, in indirect radiative forcing. However, in this bicomponent system, the cloud droplet number concentration, Nd (a crucial parameter that is used in GCMs for radiative transfer calculations), is a smoothly varying function of the <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> loading. Apart from sea-salt and <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> particles, biomass aerosol particles are also present widely in the troposphere. We find that biomass smoke can significantly perturb the activation and growth of both sulphate and sea-salt particles. For a fixed salt loading, Nd increases linearly with modest increases in sulphate and smoke masses, but significant nonlinearities are observed at higher non-sea-salt mass loadings. This non-intuitive Nd variation poses a fresh challenge to climate modellers. ...|$|R

This work compares modelled and observed patterns of vertical temperature change in the atmosphere.

40|$|<b>Sulphate</b> <b>aerosols</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to alter climate, reducing the effect of increasing greenhouse gas emissions by scattering incident solar radiation back to space. Dimethylsulphide (DMS) is emitted from the surface ocean, and oxidized into methanesulphonic acid (MSA) aerosols, or gaseous sulphur dioxide (SO₂) in the atmosphere. Sulphur dioxide is further oxidized forming new <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosols.</b> During the spring (2003) cruise of the NW Atlantic as part of the Canadian-Surface Ocean Lower Atmosphere Study (C-SOLAS), size segregated and total particulate <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosols</b> and gaseous SO₂ samples were collected. Samples were collected diurnally using mass flow-controlled, high-volume air samplers. The cruise consisted of a Lagrangian study, following a phytoplankton bloom and a Transect study from 36 °N to 54 °N. Sulphur isotope abundance analyses were conducted on both the aerosol and SO₂ samples, while chemical characterisation of anions, cations, and MSA was conducted using ion chromatography. [...] The Lagrangian study revealed relatively constant biogenic SO₂ concentrations, with variable anthropogenic SO₂ concentrations. Biogenic sulphate concentrations ranged from 0 to 1720 ngm⁻³ with the largest average concentrations in the total particulate and 0. 49 μm size fraction. These were not coincident with higher than average biogenic SO₂ concentrations. Anthropogenic sulphate dominated the smaller size fractions, and concentrations were generally larger than the biogenic concentrations {{with the exception of the}} 3. 0 - 1. 5 μm size fraction. The isotope data indicated that the smaller size fractions were dominated by anthropogenic emissions, likely derived from the ships emissions. Negative δ³⁴ SNSS values were present in the data set and are potentially linked to the combustion of Middle Eastern oil at a refinery in Newfoundland or H₂S flaring from the Sable Island gas fields. ...|$|E
40|$|There is overall {{agreement}} that volcanic <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosols</b> {{in the stratosphere}} can reduce solar radiation reaching the earth’s surface for years, thereby reducing surface temperatures, affecting global circulation patterns and generally the global climate system.

NAME results compare favorably with available observations in terms of both geographical distribution and magnitude for all three cases. The NAME modeled values of SO 2 show a correlation of 0. 8 with the corresponding observations for Sarychev. Ninety percent of modeled values of northern hemisphere averaged sulphate AOD are within a factor of 2 of those observed for Kasatochi and 71 % are within a factor of 2 of those observed for Sarychev.

The reduction in global-mean precipitation when stratospheric aerosol geoengineering is used to counterbalance global warming from increasing carbon dioxide concentrations has been mainly attributed to the temperature-independent effect of carbon dioxide on atmospheric radiative cooling. We demonstrate here that stratospheric <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> itself also acts to reduce global-mean precipitation independent of its effects on temperature. The temperature-independent effect of stratospheric aerosol geoenginering on global-mean precipitation is calculated by removing temperature-dependent effects from climate model simulations of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP). When <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> is injected into the stratosphere at a rate of 5 Tg SO 2 per year the aerosol reduces global-mean precipitation by approximately 0. 2 %, though multiple ensemble members are required to separate this effect from internal variability. For comparison, the precipitation reduction from the temperature-independent effect of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations under the RCP 4. 5 scenario of the future is approximately 0. 5 %. Thetemperature-independent effect of stratospheric <b>sulphate</b> <b>aerosol</b> arises from the aerosol's effect on tropospheric radiative cooling. Radiative transfer calculations show this is mainly due to increasing downward emission of infrared radiation by the aerosol, {{but there is also a}} contribution from the stratospheric warming the aerosol causes. Our results suggest climate model simulations of solar dimming can capture the main features of the global-mean precipitation response to stratospheric aerosol geoengineering.
