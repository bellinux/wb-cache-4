5|$|Mary Dudley {{said that}} if this were not true, I might be <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not {{say such a thing}} as it might cost her her life and she was acting now with the Queen's consent, but she (the Queen) would not speak to the Emperor's {{ambassador}} about it.|$|E
5|$|Several of the Japanese {{performers}} had voiced {{their characters}} in the games, {{but they were also}} given ample information about their characters' roles in the anime. Chris' voice actress Sanae Kobayashi was not <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be able to effectively communicate Chris' growth as a person owing to Sonic's presence, but found that a worthwhile goal. Chikao Ōtsuka, who voiced Eggman, found him a difficult character to play due to the tension in his voice and Ōtsuka's desire to have children who watched the show recognize the character as a villain but not hate him.|$|E
25|$|There were no {{sports teams}} for girls {{when she was}} in high school, but she played a number of sports {{including}} basketball, in rec leagues and pickup. When she was younger, she played with both boys and girls. As she entered her high school years, the girls dropped out for other interests, so she was more apt to play with boys. To help make <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be chosen, she bought the best basketball she could afford, so if the boys wanted to play with her basketball, they would have to pick her.|$|E
60|$|And so {{she made}} her promise. And, knowing Pomona, I felt <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> keep it--if <b>she</b> could.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I'd rather walk," [...] {{answered}} Nan, feeling quite <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{be obliged}} to do so, and preparing her mind for it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I do," [...] he replied. [...] "I {{am quite}} <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not feel {{as she does}} unless you had been guilty of {{something}} very terrible indeed." ...|$|R
500|$|Daniela Denby-Ashe had not {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Margaret Hale but for that of Fanny Thornton, and was not <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be participating on the project, but the producers had been looking for the right Margaret {{for a long time and}} Denby-Ashe's [...] "directness, energy and charm" [...] as well as the chemistry she had with would-be co-star Richard Armitage proved decisive. Armitage himself had been the first actor to read {{for the role}} of John Thornton and even though his performance had impressed producer Kate Bartlett and casting director Jill Trevellick, they still had to see many other possible Thorntons. Three weeks after casting had begun, Trevellick decided to recapitulate the first auditions, realising that Armitage was [...] "perfect".|$|E
500|$|Despite Mercedes' {{relationship}} with Russ Owen (Stuart Manning), she {{had sex with}} Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas) and feeling guilty, proposed to Russ which he accepted. Metcalfe felt Mercedes might again stray with [...] "Warren hanging around on the sidelines" [...] although she hoped Mercedes would remain faithful to Russ. Mercedes and Russ marry despite the ceremony being interrupted by Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee). Looking back at the wedding, Metcalfe commented that the wedding [...] "didn't go smoothly". Warren was accused of attempting to murder Clare Devine (Gemma Bissix), but his innocence and her infidelity was established when {{it was revealed that}} they were together the night Clare was attacked. Metcalfe said that [...] "although Mercedes knew she was taking a risk by sleeping with Warren, she genuinely thought she'd get away with it". She opined that after her and Russ' [...] "honeymoon period" [...] ended, Mercedes felt guilty and considered [...] "spilling the beans", although Metcalfe was not <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> tell the truth about her affair with Russ.|$|E
500|$|Reardon and Yeates' friends set up {{a website}} and used social {{networking}} services to help look for her. On 21 December 2010, Yeates' parents and Reardon made a public appeal for her safe return at a police press conference. In another press conference, broadcast live on 23 December 2010 by Sky News and BBC News, Yeates' father David commented on her disappearance: [...] "I think she was abducted after getting home to her flat ... I {{have no idea of}} the circumstances of the abduction because of what was left behind ... I feel <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not have gone out by herself leaving all these things behind and she was taken away somewhere". Her keys, phone, purse and coat were left behind at her flat. Detectives retrieved a receipt for a pizza, but found no sign of it or of its packaging. Both bottles of cider were found in the flat, one of them partially consumed. As {{there was no evidence of}} forced entry or a struggle, investigators began to examine the possibility that Yeates may have known her abductor.|$|E
60|$|But {{the rest}} of us rather looked with favour on the Story Girl's idea. We felt <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> do penance as picturesquely and {{thoroughly}} as she did everything else.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you made}} {{yourself}} <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like to figure in that character? I should think no woman {{would be more}} abhorrent to her. Does she quite {{know what you are}} doing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it, Geoffrey. I {{wanted to}} see your {{happiness}} before I go away again, and should like {{to stay with you}} a day or so if you are <b>sure</b> that--that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like it." ...|$|R
2500|$|In her {{autobiography}} Cross Creek {{first published}} in 1942, Rawlings described how she owned many acres of land and also hired many people to help her with day-to-day chores and activities. An entire chapter {{of the book is}} dedicated to one woman she hired, whose name was Beatrice, but whom she was affectionately known as [...] "GeeChee", because the woman was ethnically part of the GeeChee people. In the book Rawlings said GeeChee's mother lived in nearby Hawthorne, Florida and GeeChee was blind in one eye from a fight she was involved in. GeeChee was employed by Rawlings on and off for nearly two years in which GeeChee dutifully made life easier for Rawlings. GeeChee revealed to Rawlings that her boyfriend named Leroy was serving time in prison for manslaughter, and asked Rawlings for help in gaining his release. She arranged for Leroy to be paroled to her and come work for her estate, and had a wedding on the grounds for Beatrice and Leroy. After a few weeks, Leroy aggressively demanded for more earnings from Rawlings and threatened her. She decided he had to leave, which caused her distress because she did not want GeeChee to go with him, and was <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>would.</b> GeeChee eventually decided to stay with Rawlings, but GeeChee began to drink heavily and abandoned her. Weeks later, Rawlings went out searching for GeeChee and drove her back to her estate, describing GeeChee as a [...] "Black Florence Nightingale". GeeChee was unable to stop herself from drinking, which led a heartbroken Rawlings to dismiss her. Rawlings stated in her autobiography [...] "No maid of perfection--and now I have one--can fill the strange emptiness she left in a remote corner of my heart. I think of her often, and I know she does of me, for she comes once a year to see me".|$|E
60|$|GERALD. Oh! I am <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>would,</b> Lady Hunstanton, if {{she knew}} Lord Illingworth had made me such an offer.|$|E
60|$|HARRIET. If Miss Phoebe were here, I am <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{not allow}} her old pupils {{to be so}} neglected.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{has never}} heard of that, you may depend,' said Cherry, {{gathering}} up {{the corners of her}} mouth, and nodding at Tom. 'I am far from <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> bear you any mighty ill will for it, if she had.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, [...] "that wouldn't do. She {{has kept}} {{account of the}} time, you may be <b>sure,</b> and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> ask me at once if I was inquiring in your behalf, and I should {{have to tell her}} the truth." ...|$|R
50|$|They finally wed in 1400. Marie was an able {{administrator}} {{and on her}} deathbed revealed to Louis that she had saved the amount of 200,000 écus. This to make <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{be able to pay}} his ransom in case he would be captured.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would she go?" [...] {{repeated}} Zizzbaum, with uplifted eyebrows. [...] "Sure, {{she would}} go. I will introduce you. <b>Sure,</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I am <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not mind,' said Valetta. 'Only think, she {{has got a}} {{portfolio}} with pictures of everything all through the Bible!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mamma! O, don't {{speak of}} her; she would die, I am <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>would,</b> without him; and then I should too, for I should have nothing." ...|$|E
60|$|I didn’t {{call out}} after her. I felt <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> return. I went up {{slowly to the}} first floor and met her coming down again, this time {{carrying}} a lighted candle. She had managed to make herself presentable in an extraordinarily short time.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a very}} stupid view," [...] Julien declared. [...] "Anne cares no {{more for}} me than for any other man. She isn't that sort. Even if I were in a {{position}} to marry any one, I am quite <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> refuse me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{impossible}} to have {{too much of a}} good thing. But I must not look any more. Though Agatha says she does not love me, I am not <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be pleased if I were to look for love from anyone else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed I do; {{that was}} why I made <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have come home with me. I was so dreadfully {{disappointed}} when I found only her note." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I am so sorry," [...] {{she cried}} softly, [...] "so very sorry. Why cannot my mother {{leave her alone}} with you? I am <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be happier." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And yet,' said Phoebe, {{taking this}} as forgiveness, 'you see she never {{believed}} {{that you would}} give her up. If she did, I am <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not have gone.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Henry {{produced}} the prospectus of the Venetian Hotel Company. 'You're a funny old woman,' he said. 'There, you dashing speculator--there is neck-or-nothing for you! You must {{keep it a}} secret from Miss Agnes, mind. I'm not at all <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> approve of my helping you to this investment.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She does, {{having been}} urged {{to do so}} by some meddling friend; for I'm quite <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never have thought of doing so herself, seeing that she {{received}} no damage at all beyond a fright. I'm going to pay her a visit to-day in reference to that very thing." ...|$|R
60|$|She was {{not quite}} <b>sure.</b> <b>She</b> thought it <b>would</b> be when her hair was grey--or rather white. She had been {{informed}} by experts that her peculiar shade of hair went white, not grey.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not. But I {{will not}} try her temper in that respect. Sometimes I fancy {{that she does}} not even like seeing Lord Lufton talking to me." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Anne felt one sickening pang of defeat and disappointment. So she had failed and Gilbert had won! Well, Matthew would be sorry--he {{had been so}} <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> win.|$|E
60|$|GREAT-HEART. Whither! nay, none but God knows whither. But, in general, to be <b>sure,</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{have drawn}} thee into 'many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in {{destruction}} and perdition'--(1 Tim. 6:9).|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let me {{at least}} tell my story. She had done so, and I had given her mine; and when {{you told me to}} go, I went, not quite knowing then what it might be best that we should do, but feeling very <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> at least be true to me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Alison; [...] "I haven't {{a friend}} in Canada, except, perhaps, one who married a western wheat-grower {{two or three years}} ago, and I'm not <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be pleased to see me. As it happens, my mother was once or twice, I am afraid, a little rude to her." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{had to work}} fast; {{but before}} the tide came in again we had {{stripped}} her of her sails and masts, righted her, and filled her about a quarter full of rock ballast. If she didn't stick too fast in the mud I was <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> float this time right side up.|$|R
