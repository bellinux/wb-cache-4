In the more fertile parts of the country, such as the Thames valley, the Midlands and the east of England, legumes and beans were also cultivated.

Despite this, up until 1962 the Argentine GDP per capita was higher than of Austria, Italy, Japan and of its former colonial master, Spain.

Altogether, a marathon of referendums in 1992 - 1996, instead of encouraging of participatory culture, stimulated the protest behaviour in Lithuania's politics, when citizens became politically active only if they have had an object to oppose certain decisions rather than they were interested to support positively one or another position, or discuss different political alternatives.

5|$|Allied {{air raids}} {{significantly}} influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender. While the USSBS did not state that any single factor caused the surrender, during interrogations most Japanese wartime leaders nominated the prolonged air {{attacks on the}} home islands as the <b>single</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> factor which influenced their decision to end the war. In particular, Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki stated {{that the combination of}} the conventional B-29 raids, Potsdam Declaration and atomic bombings gave the Government the opportunity to begin negotiations with the Allies. Emperor Hirohito cited damage from the attacks, inadequate preparations to resist invasion and the Soviet offensive as his justifications for authorizing the surrender. To achieve this, the American Twentieth Strategic Air Force, in concert with its Allies, dropped 160,800 tons of bombs on the Japanese home islands. Of this total, 147,000 tons of bombs were dropped by the B-29 bomber force. Around 90percent of the American tonnage fell in the last five months of the war. The financial cost of the campaign to the United States was $4 billion; this expenditure was much lower than the $30 billion spent on bomber operations in Europe, and a small proportion of the $330 billion the US Government spent on the war.|$|E

5|$|Byzantium looked {{impressive}} when Manuel died in 1180, {{having just}} celebrated the betrothal {{of his son}} Alexios II to {{the daughter of the}} king of France. Thanks to the diplomacy and campaigning of Alexios, John, and Manuel, the empire was a great power, economically prosperous, and secure on its frontiers; but there were serious problems as well. Internally, the Byzantine court required a strong leader to hold it together, and after Manuel's death stability was seriously endangered from within. Some of the foreign enemies of the Empire were lurking on the flanks, waiting for a chance to attack, in particular the Turks in Anatolia, whom Manuel had ultimately failed to defeat, and the Normans in Sicily, who had already tried but failed to invade the Empire on several occasions. Even the Venetians, the <b>single</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> western ally of Byzantium, were on bad terms with the empire at Manuel's death in 1180. Given this situation, it would have taken a strong Emperor to secure the Empire against the foreign threats it now faced, and to rebuild the depleted Imperial Treasury. But Manuel's son was a minor, and his unpopular regency government was overthrown in a violent coup d'état. This troubled succession weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse's {{treatment}} of quarterback Doug Williams caused resentment {{not only on}} the team, but in the entire Bay Area community. Williams led the Buccaneers to the playoffs in three of his five years with the team, and was considered to be their <b>single</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> player. However, he was only paid $120,000 a year, which ranked 42nd among NFL quarterbacks, was less than what some teams' third-string quarterbacks made, and was lower than the salary of Terdell Middleton, a running back who had two total carries in his two years in Tampa Bay. After the 1982 season, Williams asked for a $600,000 contract that would pay him among the league's top quarterbacks. Culverhouse refused to budge from his initial offer of $400,000, which he said would make Williams one of the five highest-paid quarterbacks in the league. Williams' agent disputed this, saying that Culverhouse's offer was substantially less than what several other quarterbacks made. With negotiations at a standstill, the Buccaneers traded the following season's first-round draft pick to the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for Jack Thompson, a backup quarterback who had been unable to unseat Ken Anderson, as an insurance policy should Williams prove impossible to sign, or have trouble recovering from offseason knee surgery. Williams interpreted this as a sign that the team did not want him, and instead signed a contract with the Oklahoma Outlaws of the United States Football League.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania Avenue (often known {{simply as}} The Avenue) and Fremont Avenue were the major scenes for Baltimore's black musicians from the 1920s to the 1950s, and was an early home for Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, among others. Baltimore had long been a major stop on the black touring circuit, and jazz musicians {{frequently}} played on Pennsylvania Avenue {{on the way to}} or from engagements in New York. Pennsylvania Avenue attracted African Americans {{from as far away as}} North Carolina, and was known for its vibrant entertainment and nightlife, as well as a more seedy side, home to prostitution, violence, ragtime and jazz, which were perceived as unsavory. The <b>single</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> venue for outside acts was the Royal Theatre, which was one of the finest African American theaters in the country when it was opened as the Douglass Theater, and was part of the popular performing circuit that included the Earle in Philadelphia, the Howard in Washington, D.C., the Regal in Chicago and the Apollo Theater in New York; like the Apollo, the audience at the Royal Theater was known for cruelly receiving those performers who didn't live up to their standards. Music venues were segregated, though not without resistance - a 1910 tour featuring Bert Williams resulted in an African American boycott of a segregated theater, hoping the threat of lost business from the popular show would cause a change in policy. Pennsylvania Avenue was also a center for black cultural and economic life in Baltimore, and was home to numerous schools, theaters, churches and other landmarks. The street's nightclubs and other entertainment venues were most significant however, including the Penn Hotel, the first African American-owned hotel in Baltimore (built in 1921). Even the local bars and other establishments that didn't feature live music as a major feature generally had a solo pianist or organist. The first local bar to specialize in jazz was Club Tijuana. Major music venues at this time included Ike Dixon's Comedy Club, Skateland, Gamby's, Wendall's Tavern, The New Albert Dreamland, the Ritz, and most importantly, the Sphinx Club. The Sphinx Club became one of the first minority-owned nightclubs in the United States when it opened in 1946, founded by Charles Phillip Tilghman, a local businessman.|$|E

This argument represents the same logic that data envelopment analysis (DEA) applies to measure the relative efficiency using several inputs to produce a single output or a set of outputs. This study applies DEA to performance data in year 2007 for 43 pitchers of the Chinese professional baseball league (CPBL) and to estimate the proportion of pitchers who perceived their signed salaries {{for the next year}} were paid with inequity. Each pitcher is treated as a decision-making unit. The input variables include the numbers of innings pitched, the pitchers’ earned run averages, and walks plus hits per inning pitched, while the <b>single</b> and <b>most</b> <b>important</b> output is the pitcher’s salary for the next year (2008).

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{our study}} is to define the needs of ICU patients’ {{families}} in the specific suburban-rural population of Crete Island. Background: Families of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients have specific needs that should also be addressed by the ICU-care team. Current research has mostly concentrated on families from an urban setting, therefore may not be applicable to other populations. Design: Prospective cohort study Methods: Subjects: Family members of patients admitted in the ICU for ? 48 hours over 18 months, in a mixed medical-surgical, 11 bed closed ICU. Questionnaire: The Greek translation of Critical Care Family Need Inventory (CCFNI), which consists of 45 need items covering the information, reassurance, proximity, support and comfort domains. Each item was scored on a four-point scale (1 = very important to 4 = not important). Participants {{were also asked to}} <b>single</b> out the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> need from the CCFNI and complete a questionnaire on basic demographic characteristics. Results: 230 (65 %) family members completed the questionnaire. Mean score for each of the 45 items ranged from 1. 03 - 3 (scale from 1 : very important to 4 : not important). 14 items were rated by responders as very important (mean score < 1. 25). Reassurance need items were consistently <b>singled</b> out as <b>most</b> <b>important</b> regardless of the participant’s background. Participants with a lower educational and socio-economical status rated support need items as more important than those with a higher status. Conclusion: In this particular suburban-rural population, both ‘universal’ reassurance needs and specific support needs related to responders’ educational or socio-economical background were identified. Relevance to clinical practice: Enhanced recognition of these needs may improve quality of care offered by ICU-care team to families of their patients. ...|$|R
