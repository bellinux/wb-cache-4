2500|$|When {{the song}} was first released, Rick Melbourne, a breakfast radio announcer, {{produced}} a parody version of the song, including the lyrics [...] "God help me, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sixteen". Australian country singer John Williamson recorded a live version as [...] "Only 19" [...] and released it on his 1984 vinyl LP, The Smell of Gumleaves (rereleased in 1996 as a CD under the title Home Among the Gum Trees).|$|E
60|$|After {{a little}} further {{conversation}} <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> from London, and was down with her people for their holiday.|$|E
6000|$|... "Devoted, of course; {{she wished}} you {{to marry her}} candidate. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{watching}} you only in order to interpose." ...|$|E
60|$|THE CAPTAIN [continuing unmoved]. She {{married a}} numskull. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> would marry anyone {{to get away}} from home.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{came to see}} <b>ME.</b> <b>She</b> {{knocked at}} my shabby door. She mounted my squalid stair. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> had seen you at Folkestone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>she</b> <b>told</b> me-- You can't {{understand}} what <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>She's</b> been {{away with this}} young fellow once, and she said as much as that she'd go again." ...|$|R
6000|$|Philammon blushed scarlet, but {{he dared}} not lie. 'There was a--a poor black woman, wounded and trodden down, and I dare not leave her, for <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a Christian.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{maternal}} Sellars waddled {{after us}} into the passage, which she completely blocked. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> delight-ted to have met me, {{and that she was}} always at home on Sundays.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{did think}} {{directly}} of asking her that," [...] says he; [...] "and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> quite certain {{that there was}} no written evidence of the forgery except that one letter." ...|$|E
60|$|Fortunately she's {{taken it}} very well. I confess I {{was a little}} nervous when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> meant to stay on in Egypt to be near her son.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{give it to}} her, sir," [...] Adam said, [...] "and {{tell her}} your words. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> should {{come back to the}} people at the Hall Farm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For Julia? Is Julia {{so great}} as that? <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> had the {{greatest}} regard for you. You're {{good enough for the}} best, my dear boy," [...] Mr. Carteret pursued.|$|R
6000|$|Leland started, {{and there}} was no doubt that his concern was genuine. [...] "Oh," [...] he said, [...] "the thing's quite out of the question. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going to stay with us as long as we wanted her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Roberts: [...] "And <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> no more a cook than my wife was; and {{she said}} she'd teach me to be playing my jokes on ladies; and she grabbed up her things and flew out of the room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw her yesterday," [...] Tallente said reminiscently. [...] "This morning <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{going to}} ride out to inspect for herself the farm of the one black sheep amongst her tenants. I looked out towards Woolhanger as I {{came up in the}} train. It seemed like a miasma of driven snow and mists." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is gone!" [...] he cried, with a gasp of relief. [...] "No, by heaven! {{there she}} is again, and nearer--coming nearer. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> would come for <b>me,</b> and <b>she</b> keeps her word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did, and it so struck Jean that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> {{would rather}} be an old maid for life, 'the which,' she said, 'is a dismal prospect,' than marry out of the Auld Licht kirk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes; {{very near}} here. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> had known this old house well years ago, {{when she was}} a girl. She used to visit it in company with her father, a friend of old Señor Cristoval.” ...|$|R
60|$|By-and-by, when I {{found an}} {{opportunity}} of speaking to our hostess, I asked her who that charming lady was, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a Miss Somebody--I forget the name--a {{native of the}} town, also {{that she was a}} great favourite there and was loved by everyone, rich and poor, and that she had been a very hard worker ever since the war began, and had inspired all the women in the place to work.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{made out}} of a rib taken from my body. This is at least doubtful, if not more than that. I have not missed any rib.... She is in much trouble about the buzzard; says grass does not agree with it; is afraid she can't raise it; thinks it was {{intended}} to live on decayed flesh. The buzzard must get along the best it can with what is provided. We cannot overturn the whole scheme to accommodate the buzzard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bill, it {{was some}} long time ago since you saw me," [...] said Danny. [...] "Fact is, I know how you felt, because Gene kept me posted. I {{happened}} to run across Bonita, an' I wasn't goin' to let her ride away alone, when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in trouble. We hit the trail for the Peloncillos. Bonita had Gene's horse, an' she was to meet him up on the trail. We got to the mountains all right, an' nearly starved {{for a few days}} till Gene found us. He had got in trouble himself an' couldn't fetch much with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{assures me}} so, Lady Narborough," [...] said Dorian. [...] "I asked her whether, like Marguerite de Navarre, she had their hearts embalmed and hung at her girdle. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> didn't, {{because none of}} them had had any hearts at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|One day being discoursing {{with her}} upon the {{extremities}} they suffered, I {{asked her if}} she could describe by what she felt what it was to starve, and how it appeared? <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> believed she could, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> her tale very distinctly thus: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, but wait,' Stephen {{pleaded with}} wet eyes. 'She went on that cliff to see <b>me</b> arrive home: <b>she</b> had promised it. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> would months before. And {{would she have}} gone there {{if she had not}} cared for me at all?' ...|$|R
60|$|When {{we were in}} Switzerland, {{which appears}} to have been years ago, though it was only weeks, I met young Mrs Gowan, who was on a {{mountain}} excursion like ourselves. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very well and very happy. She sent you the message, by me, that she thanked you affectionately and would never forget you. She was quite confiding with me, and I loved her almost as soon as I spoke to her. But there is nothing singular in that; who could help loving so beautiful and winning a creature! I could not wonder at any one loving her. No indeed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could see}} her future. She's so attractive. And her defences are gone. She's lost faith, and belief in all that a good woman should be. The day after she came back <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ashamed of herself. But since--she's not given a sign. She's so proud--my poor little Nollie. I see how men admire her, too. Our Belgian friend is {{painting}} her. He's a good man; but he finds her beautiful, and who can wonder. And your friend Captain Fort. Fathers {{are supposed to be}} blind, but they see very clear sometimes." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{had not yet}} {{sufficiently}} {{recovered from}} her agitation to be quite prepared for the visit we had to make. She desired me {{to get into the}} chariot, and to tell the coachman to drive slowly up and down a little while. She said no more, except, 'My dear child, never ask me what it was, and don't refer to it,' until she had perfectly regained her composure, when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> quite herself now, and we might get out. On her giving me her purse to pay the driver, I found that all the guineas were gone, and only the loose silver remained.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, and I {{was afraid}} {{to ask her to}} give it. But the landlady here is not a very scrupulous person. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> looked at the poor creature's linen while it was drying by the fire. The name marked on it was, 'Van Brandt.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Clementina, [...] "I didn't see {{anything}} of it. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> {{had made a}} will; but she didn't quite like it, and sometimes {{she thought she would}} change it. She spoke of getting you to do it; I didn't know but she had." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are they? You {{will see}} {{them more than}} once. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> could not live without you," [...] {{answered}} Almayer, speaking without the faintest spark of expression in his face, [...] "so it behoves {{you to go to}} her quick, for fear you may find her dead." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was going}} on with that part of the story, when her own part in it {{interrupted}} her, and {{with a great deal of}} good-humoured confidence <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> one of the second sort of inhabitants herself; that she came away openly, having ventured too far in a particular case, so that she was become a criminal. 'And here's the mark of it, child,' says she; and, pulling off her glove, 'look ye here,' says she, turning up the palm of her hand, and showed me a very fine white arm and hand, but branded in the inside of the hand, as in such cases it must be.|$|E
6000|$|... "Possibly I {{might have}} felt it more if it had come upon me {{two or three years}} later, just as I had got to be {{reconciled}} to the change of life, but you see I have so recently and unexpectedly come into the estate that I have not even begun to appreciate the pleasures of possession or to feel that they weigh in the slightest against the necessity of my being obliged to give up the life I have been leading for years. By the bye," [...] he went on, changing the subject carelessly, [...] "how is your daughter getting on in Germany? I happened to meet her at Newquay three weeks ago, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going out there {{in the course of a}} week or so. I suppose she has gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One night, man," [...] he said, [...] "I {{was going}} along Dame Street and I spotted a fine tart under Waterhouse's clock and said good-night, you know. So {{we went for}} a walk round by the canal and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a slavey in a house in Baggot Street. I put my arm round her and {{squeezed}} her a bit that night. Then next Sunday, man, I met her by appointment. We went out to Donnybrook and I brought her into a field there. She told me she used to go with a dairyman.... It was fine, man. Cigarettes every night she'd bring me and paying the tram out and back. And one night she brought me two bloody fine cigars--O, the real cheese, you know, that the old fellow used to smoke.... I was afraid, man, she'd get in the family way. But she's up to the dodge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not she! Last time I saw her <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> wouldn't go {{back into}} an office, or take on typewriting again, for {{anything}} in the world. She was looking prettier than ever, too. There's a swell chap almost crazy about her. Shouldn't wonder if she hasn't got an automobile." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's them! Of course it's them!" [...] cried Mrs. Aleshine. [...] "I had a feelin' {{while we}} were scootin' {{downhill}} that they was {{near and dear to}} us, though exactly why and how, I didn't know. And <b>she's</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she's</b> Lucille, and of course the other must be Emily, though what relations--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She don't know, of course, but you {{depend upon}} it that's it. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> knew {{something}} was on, and when she found 'im gone and a note lef' for her {{she knew it was}} up with 'im. 'E went by the night boat. She wrote that telegram off to me straight away." ...|$|R
