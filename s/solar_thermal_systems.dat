40|$|AbstractThis {{simulation}} study investigates both different boiler specifications {{and various}} kinds of boiler integration in <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> combi <b>systems</b> {{with the help of}} a new developed fossil fuel boiler model.

Besides the system layout the annual amounts of hot water and space heating demand and their temperature levels affect the impact of the <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>system.</b> Each additional storage tank, which is heated by conventional energy, should be analyzed critically due to their additional heat losses, which reduce the system efficiency.
