Juveniles moult from their first summer body plumage into winter plumage during late <b>September</b> <b>to</b> <b>November,</b> and later undergo a pre-breeding moult similar in timing and duration {{to that of the}} adults, and often producing as brightly coloured an appearance.|$|E

5|$|Krrish was {{the first}} Indian film to be shot in Singapore under the Singapore Tourism Board's Film-in-Singapore subsidy scheme, and more than 60% of the film was shot there. Shooting was {{accomplished}} on location over a span of two months, from <b>September</b> <b>to</b> <b>November</b> 2005. Locations featured included the Singapore Zoo, the Gateway building, and the Singapore National Library. Another major filming location was Robinson Road, where heavy rains caused production delays. The Singapore police were on location to block roads and protect the filming equipment, such as when the film's action scenes required two 250-foot high industrial cranes. Author Audrey Yue noted that the film shoot benefited Singapore by leading to domestic and Indian film-induced tourism.|$|E
5|$|Most {{mourning}} doves migrate along flyways over land. On rare occasions, mourning doves {{have been}} seen flying over the Gulf of Mexico, but this is exceptional. Spring migration north runs from March to May. Fall migration south runs from <b>September</b> <b>to</b> <b>November,</b> with immatures moving first, followed by adult females and then by adult males. Migration is usually during the day, in flocks, and at low altitudes. However, not all individuals migrate. Even in Canada some mourning doves remain through winter, sustained {{by the presence of}} bird feeders.|$|E

5|$|A feature-length {{preview of}} the series premiered at the Frameline Film Festival in June 2005, and was {{screened}} at numerous other venues before the television debut. The complete, eight-episode series aired on the Sundance Channel from <b>September</b> <b>to</b> <b>November</b> 2005, and on Logo TV from January to February 2006. In Italy it aired on Cult, a satellite television channel. It was released on DVD in the US in March 2006, and on Google Video and iTunes a few months later. That year, TransGeneration won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Documentary, and was a nominee for the IDA Documentary Award in the Limited Series category. The response to the show from critics and other viewers ranged from exuberant to dismissive. In addition, some viewers believed the show had distinct educational value, while others felt that the chosen narratives oversimplified the subject.|$|E
5|$|After {{applying}} for sea duty, Ford was sent in May 1943 to the pre-commissioning detachment {{for the new}} aircraft carrier , at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey. From the ship's commissioning on June 17, 1943, {{until the end of}} December 1944, Ford served as the assistant navigator, Athletic Officer, and antiaircraft battery officer on board the Monterey. While he was on board, the carrier participated in many actions in the Pacific Theater with the Third and Fifth Fleets in late 1943 and 1944. In 1943, the carrier helped secure Makin Island in the Gilberts, and participated in carrier strikes against Kavieng, New Ireland in 1943. During the spring of 1944, the Monterey supported landings at Kwajalein and Eniwetok and participated in carrier strikes in the Marianas, Western Carolines, and northern New Guinea, {{as well as in the}} Battle of the Philippine Sea. After an overhaul, from <b>September</b> <b>to</b> <b>November</b> 1944, aircraft from the Monterey launched strikes against Wake Island, participated in strikes in the Philippines and Ryukyus, and supported the landings at Leyte and Mindoro.|$|E
5|$|After the October Tour, U2 decamped to {{a rented}} cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical {{breakthroughs}} were {{achieved by the}} Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From <b>September</b> <b>to</b> <b>November,</b> the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December.|$|E

5|$|Clyde Fenton, {{known for}} his {{exploits}} as a flying doctor in the Northern Territory before being commissioned as a pilot in the RAAF, served as an instructor at No.3 EFTS from mid-1940 to early 1942. King was posted to command No.5 EFTS at Narromine, New South Wales, in December 1940. By this time No.3 EFTS was reported as having graduated 200 pilots in the eight flying training courses it had run since its formation. One of its graduates was Nicky Barr, who become a fighter ace in the North African Campaign with twelve victories to his credit. No.3 EFTS began operating a ground-based Link Trainer on 17February 1941. The school started flying the recently introduced CAC Wackett Trainer in August 1941, but the type proved troublesome, delaying the training program. From <b>September</b> <b>to</b> <b>November</b> 1941, a detachment of personnel from No.11 EFTS also utilised training facilities at Essendon, after their home aerodrome at Benalla had been inundated by heavy rain. No.3 EFTS's instructors, students and Wackett Trainers were transferred to No.11 EFTS during April 1942, and the Essendon school was disbanded on 1May.|$|E
5|$|Flying at Benalla was {{hampered}} by bad weather, and the runway was unusable from <b>September</b> <b>to</b> <b>November</b> 1941, necessitating the detachment of over 250 personnel to Essendon, home of No.3 EFTS, {{to continue their}} training. In October 1941, six airmen of No.11 EFTS were court-martialled for mutiny. Their main grievance was having to undertake guard duty at night and attend parades at 7:15am {{in addition to their}} regular ground support work. One of the men was found guilty of incitement and the other five for failing to report their knowledge of the matter to the commanding officer. The former was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment and the others to between five and six months detention; all were discharged from the Air Force. On 11December 1941, one of the school's Tiger Moths made a crash landing in a field and struck four people on the ground, killing two and injuring the others; the two pilots were uninjured. The outbreak of war in the Pacific saw slit trenches being dug at the base.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1892, the Carabane {{school was}} one of the first in the region. It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns {{belonging}} to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from <b>September</b> <b>to</b> <b>November,</b> when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona.|$|E
