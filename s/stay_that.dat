5|$|The King County Superior Court {{ruled in}} April that the {{university}} was exempt from the city's landmarks-preservation ordinance and could go ahead with demolition of the More Hall Annex. While the city and preservationists appealed the decision, they allowed the demolition of the More Hall Annex to proceed by not seeking a <b>stay</b> <b>that</b> would leave them responsible for damages compensation. The decision was appealed to the Washington Supreme Court, who ruled in the city's favor, and rejected the university's claimed exemption from the city landmarks preservation ordinance.|$|E
5|$|On February 20, 2010, Noriega's lawyers filed a {{petition}} with the Supreme Court of the United States to block his extradition to France, after the court refused {{to hear his}} appeal the previous month. Noriega's attorneys had hoped the dissenting opinion in that ruling, written by Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, would convince the full court to take up his case, but on March 22, 2010, the Supreme Court refused to hear the petition. Two days after the refusal, the District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami lifted the <b>stay</b> <b>that</b> was blocking Noriega's extradition. Later that month Noriega's attorney stated that he would travel to France and try to arrange {{a deal with the}} French government.|$|E
5|$|To create Lou Bloom's character, Gilroy {{explored}} {{the ideas of}} unemployment and capitalism. He wanted to portray Lou as someone who perpetually focuses on the precepts of capitalism, and how these thoughts not only give him sanity, but also push him over the edge. Gilroy did not give Lou a character arc, as he believed that people develop their ideals {{at a certain point}} in their life, and that they <b>stay</b> <b>that</b> way regardless of what happens. This is depicted in the opening scene of the film, when Lou attacks a security guard, which informs the audience that Lou is a criminal, and not someone who lost their morality {{as a result of the}} job. Lou's backstory was purposefully left out of the script, as Gilroy felt that without one, the audience would create their own backstories for Lou, and become more engaged with the character. Gilroy remarked that Lou eventually became a vehicle for the ideas and themes that he wanted to express in the film.|$|E

The sixth couple, like several others, had a Colorado civil union. The complaint referenced the recent Tenth Circuit decision in Kitchen v. Herbert.

500|$|Aristotle {{provided}} a philosophical {{discussion of the}} concept of a force {{as an integral part of}} Aristotelian cosmology. In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different [...] "natural places" [...] therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will <b>stay</b> <b>that</b> way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their [...] "natural place" [...] (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to [...] "natural motion", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general.|$|E
