5|$|A major <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> in {{the study}} of {{bacteria}} came in 1977 when Carl Woese recognised that archaea have a separate line of evolutionary descent from bacteria. This new phylogenetic taxonomy depended on the sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA, and divided prokaryotes into two evolutionary domains, as part of the three-domain system.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Eli Todd also viewed alcohol as the “prominent evil of the day”. On February 22, 1842, the Washington Society of Farmington was formed. They practiced total abstinence, and {{employed}} social pressure for temperance in Farmington. By 1847, 569 people {{were part of}} this society. This was a <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> as part of Dr. Eli Todd’s attack against alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|Gemini was a <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> for NASA's manned space program: the Gemini capsule {{was larger}} and more {{advanced}} than Mercury, capable of supporting two men {{for up to a}} two-week mission. Because of the longer mission durations, Mission Control began to be manned in shifts. In 1964, Glynn Lunney and Gene Kranz were selected by Chris Kraft to join Kraft and his deputy John Hodge as flight directors. Aged only twenty-eight, Lunney was the youngest of the four.|$|E
5000|$|In Pakistan, a {{variation}} that uses two dice allows backwards movement. The dice are rolled and the die values {{can be used}} independently or in combination to move two pieces or a single piece forwards or backwards or both. For example, if the roll gives 1 and 4, the player can move a single piece 4 <b>steps</b> <b>forwards</b> and then 1 step backwards, or 1 <b>step</b> <b>forwards</b> and 4 <b>steps</b> backwards, or 1 then 4 <b>steps</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards. Or the player can move a piece 1 <b>step</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards, and another piece 4 <b>steps</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards.|$|R
50|$|Both {{starting}} with the left foot, take four steps forward; on the fifth step, change position, the man crossing over behind the lady without releasing the hands or losing a step; three more <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> and then cross back again; then three more <b>steps</b> <b>forward.</b> In other words, this is merely twelve <b>steps</b> <b>forward,</b> changes of position being made on the fifth and ninth steps. Completion of these twelve steps leaves the dancers {{in the same position}} as at the start.|$|R

5|$|After the Lancastrians {{had ceased}} loosing their arrows, Fauconberg ordered his archers to <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> again to shoot. When they had {{exhausted}} their ammunition, the Yorkists plucked arrows {{off the ground}} in front of them—arrows loosed by their foes—and continued loosing. Coming under attack without any effective response of its own, the Lancastrian army moved from its position to engage the Yorkists in close combat. Seeing the advancing mass of men, the Yorkist archers shot a few more volleys before retreating behind their ranks of men-at-arms, leaving thousands of arrows in the ground to hinder the Lancastrian attack.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} 1991–92 season, with the Rockets' record only 26–26, Chaney was fired and {{replaced}} by his assistant Rudy Tomjanovich, a former Houston player himself. While the Rockets {{did not make the}} playoffs, Tomjanovich's arrival was considered a <b>step</b> <b>forward.</b> In the next year, the Rockets improved their record by 13 games, getting the Midwest Division title, and winning their first playoff series in 6 years by defeating the Los Angeles Clippers, before an elimination by the SuperSonics in a closely contested Game 7 overtime loss.|$|E
25|$|Observant Jews {{have the}} custom to take three steps {{back and then}} three <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> {{both before and after}} reciting the Amidah. The steps {{backward}} at the beginning represent withdrawing one's attention from the material world, and then <b>stepping</b> <b>forward</b> to symbolically approach the King of Kings. The Mekhilta notes that the significance of the three steps is based on the three barriers that Moses had to pass through at Sinai before entering God's realm. The Mishnah Berurah wrote that only the <b>steps</b> <b>forward</b> are necessary, while the backward steps beforehand are a prevalent custom.|$|R

5|$|Passenger service {{began on}} September 11, 1972, {{initially}} just between MacArthur and Fremont. The {{rest of the}} system opened in stages, with the entire system opening in 1974 when the transbay service though the Transbay Tube began. The new BART system was hailed as a major <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> in subway technology, although questions were asked concerning {{the safety of the}} system and the huge expenditures necessary for the construction of the network. Ridership remained well below projected levels throughout the 1970s, and direct service from Daly City to Richmond and Fremont was not phased in until several years after the system opened.|$|E
5|$|Previous films by Hepworth and {{his company}} had been {{considered}} {{a continuation of the}} cinema of attractions. The first few years of the 20th century were a period in which many film-makers began placing a higher emphasis on portraying a narrative story, and lesser so more on the image and the ability to show something. The film is considered a <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> in both film grammar and structure. Contemporary audiences may find it rather hoary, although one scholar has noted the format would be familiar to fans of the dog character Lassie.|$|E
5|$|Shane arms {{the rest}} of the group and they {{converge}} on the barn just as Hershel, Rick, and the other return with the snared walkers. Shane screams that walkers are not people and shoots one of the captive walkers before breaking the locks off the barn doors. Walkers start to file out, and Shane, Andrea, T-Dog (IronE Singleton), Daryl, and Glenn execute the zombies while the others watch. At the last moment, Sophia (Madison Lintz) emerges from the barn, dead and zombified. The group is paralyzed with shock and sadness, unable to act as Sophia walks towards them. Only Rick is able to <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> and shoot her.|$|E

5|$|The first Alfa-Romeo engined Brabham, the Brabham BT45 was an {{overweight}} and bulky car, initially weighing 625kg and {{as wide as}} was permitted under the F1 technical regulations. This {{was due to the}} difficulties of packaging the large, powerful Alfa flat-12 engine and the fuel it required to complete a race distance. After lengthy development, it became competitive, but never won a race. In mid-1977, Brabham designer Gordon Murray started work on the ambitious design of the BT46. It was intended to compensate for the weight of the engine and fuel and allow the Brabham team to take a large technical <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> as well as to improve safety.|$|E
5|$|While Kilburn led one {{design team}} working on Meg, he led another with Dick Grimsdale and Douglas Webb, on a {{research}} project examining what he believed {{would be the next}} <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> in computer design: the use of transistors. The 48-bit machine they completed in November 1953 was the world's first transistor computer, with 550 diodes and 92 transistors, and was manufactured by STC. An improved version completed in April 1955 had 1,300 diodes and 200 transistors, and was sold by Metropolitan-Vickers as the Metrovick 950.|$|E
5|$|With the Posse folding, the Gold Miners moving, and the Pirates facing money {{troubles}} {{three of}} the four CFL expansion teams had stumbled. The league, however, still managed to add two new cities before the 1995 season. The Memphis Mad Dogs were announced in November 1994, followed by the Birmingham Barracudas in January 1995. The Memphis deal was hailed as a large <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> for the league's presence in the US as it brought in the marketing connections of Federal Express and the wealth of its founder Fred Smith.|$|E

5|$|In 1883, {{oil tanker}} design took a large <b>step</b> <b>forward.</b> Working for the Nobel company, British {{engineer}} Colonel Henry F. Swan designed {{a set of}} three Nobel tankers. Instead {{of one or two}} large holds, Swan's design used several holds which spanned the width, or beam, of the ship. These holds were further subdivided into port and starboard sections by a longitudinal bulkhead. Earlier designs suffered from stability problems caused by the free surface effect, where oil sloshing from side to side could cause a ship to capsize. But this approach of dividing the ship's storage space into smaller tanks virtually eliminated free-surface problems. This approach, almost universal today, was first used by Swan in the Nobel tankers Blesk, Lumen, and Lux.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will <b>step</b> <b>forward,</b> so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E
5|$|Ruggiero di Lauria {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia {{shipyard}} on 3 August 1881 and launched on 9 August 1884. She was not completed for another {{three and a half}} years, her construction finally being finished on 1 February 1888. Because of the rapid pace of naval technological development in the late 19th century, her lengthy construction period meant that she was an obsolete design by the time she entered service. The year after she entered service, the British began building the , the first pre-dreadnought battleships, which marked a significant <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> in capital ship design. In addition, technological progress, particularly in armor production techniquesfirst Harvey armor and then Krupp armorrapidly rendered older vessels like Ruggiero di Lauria obsolete.|$|E

5|$|The Comet {{is widely}} {{regarded}} both as an adventurous <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> and a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft's legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations. The inquiries into the accidents that plagued the Comet 1 were {{perhaps some of the}} most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. In spite of the Comet being subjected to what was then the most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood {{at the time of the}} aircraft's development, nor was the concept of metal fatigue. While these lessons could be implemented on the drawing board for future aircraft, corrections could only be retroactively applied to the Comet.|$|E
5|$|The Malfatti and Mansholt Commissions {{followed}} with work on monetary co-operation {{and the first}} enlargement to the north in 1973. With that enlargement the Commission's membership increased to thirteen under the Ortoli Commission (the United Kingdom as a large member was granted two Commissioners), which dealt with the enlarged community during economic and international instability at that time. The external representation of the Community took a <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> when President Roy Jenkins, recruited to the presidency in January 1977 from his role as Home Secretary of the United Kingdom's Labour government, became the first President to attend a G8 summit {{on behalf of the}} Community. Following the Jenkins Commission, Gaston Thorn's Commission oversaw the Community's enlargement to the south, in addition to beginning work on the Single European Act.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of Merseyside County Council (MCC) in 1974 brought new {{hope that the}} Albert Dock could be redeveloped, with the MCC placing a high priority on its development. They soon entered negotiations with the MDHC and in 1979 eventually negotiated a deal {{to take over the}} running of the south docks. Despite this seeming <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> political wrangling between the MDHC (the dock owners), Liverpool City Council (the local planning authority) and Merseyside County Council (the group now responsible for redeveloping the docks) continued to hinder any development plans. Fed up with the in fighting the newly elected Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher decided that the city was incapable of handling regeneration initiatives itself and under the guidance of the 'Minister for Merseyside' Michael Heseltine, set up the Merseyside Development Corporation in 1981 to take over the responsibility of regenerating and redeveloping Liverpool's south docks.|$|E
