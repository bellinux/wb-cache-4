5000|$|One {{year before}} the {{creation}} of the TEE-network the French railway SNCF introduced three Trains d'affaires to link Paris with the industrial area of Nord, near the Belgian border. These trains were scheduled as a morning, midday and evening service in both directions. Initially the services were operated with RGP 600 DMUs. In 1959 these were replaced by locomotive hauled trains consisting of Corail coaches. Although domestic TEE-services were allowed from 1965, the Trains d'affaires were not upgraded to TEEs until 1978. Together with the upgrading to TEE the trains were named. The midday <b>service</b> <b>pair</b> was named Gayant.|$|E

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{continuing}} study of the application of V/STOL aircraft to the transportation problems of the Northeast Corridor, the U. S. Department of Commerce has requested that detailed data be developed on schedules, travel times, and fares which might be expected for a V/STOL system operating in the year 1980. This section deals with the computer methods used to construct such schedules. A schedule (or more properly a schedule plan) is a complete description of a transportation system. It details the services to be offered in the dimensions of time and geography, gives the routings followed by vehicles, and indicates the loadings to be placed upon terminals. A complete statistical summary of {{the operation of the}} transportation system can be obtained once the schedule is completed. The number of vehicles and crews, their daily utilization, the expected load factors, the required number of loading gates, the average length of vehicle hop, etc. are all implicitly determined by the schedule plan. Constructing and maintaining an efficient schedule is the main problem of transportation system managements. It is both their production plan and their product to be marketed, and the economic success of the plan is gauged by the management's ability to produce a low cost production which will be saleable to the travelling public. The use of computers in scheduling is not widespread at this time, and if they are used, it is generally for data processing as distinct from decision making or problem solving. The reasons for this are clear. There has not been in the past, sufficient capability either in the hardware, or the software to handle problems of the size and complexity associated with even such relatively small transportation systems. as the airline systems. This situation has been changing in the last few years, {{to the point where we}} can now begin to handle fairly large scale scheduling problems, introducing optimization at several points, and constructing fairly quickly and easily full system schedules and their statistical summaries. Parametric investigations of the effects of restricting fleet size, terminal size, etc. can be quickly carried out. Various strategies or policy decisions are similarly easily investigated. The construction of computer programs for the scheduling process immediately points out the need for detailed accurate data concerning demand. This is now becoming available to the airlines through their reservation systems and the management information systems evolving from them. We need to know, for example, detailed information on the number of people travelling from A to B throughout the day, by day of week and month of year, with an accuracy much greater than our present estimates. We would like to know the demand elasticity, e. g. the change in the number of people travelling as services are changed in time or quality for every <b>service</b> <b>pair</b> in the system. The character of the available data (as distinct from opinion) determines the type of problem that operations research and the computer will be able to successfully solve. Various large scale econometric models are conceivable, if revenue and cost data are available. This section will describe the work which has been carried out for a hypothetical Airbus short haul V/STOL system in the Northeast Corridor. It is only a beginning as valuable extensions are yet to come. December 1966 PB 174913 Includes bibliographical references (p. 75) Office of High Speed Ground Transport, Dept. of Commerc...|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{why people}} make the {{decisions}} they do remains a fundamental challenge facing conservation science. Ecosystem service (ES) (a benefit people derive from an ecosystem) approaches to conservation reflect efforts to anticipate people's preferences and influence their environmental behavior. Yet, the design of ES approaches seldom includes psychological theories of human behavior. We sought to alleviate this omission by applying a psychological theory of human values to a cross-cultural ES assessment. We used interviews and focus groups with fish workers from 28 coral reef fishing communities in 4 countries to qualitatively identify the motivations (i. e., human values) underlying preferences for ES; quantitatively evaluate resource user ES priorities; and identify common patterns among ES motivations and ES priorities (i. e., trade-offs and synergies). Three key findings are evident that align with human values theory. First, motivations underlying preferences for individual ESs reflected multiple human values within the same value domain (e. g., self-enhancement). Second, when averaged at community or country scales, the order of ES priorities was consistent. However, the order belied significant variation that existed among individuals. Third, in line with human values theory, ESs related {{to one another in}} a consistent pattern; certain <b>service</b> <b>pairs</b> reflected trade-off relationships (e. g., supporting and provisioning), whereas other <b>service</b> <b>pairs</b> reflected synergistic relationships (e. g., supporting and regulating). Together, these findings help improve understanding of when and why convergence and trade-offs in people's preferences for ESs occur, and this knowledge can inform the development of suitable conservation actions...|$|R

However, the rapid introduction of new <b>services</b> <b>paired</b> with the dynamicity of the business environment also leads to undesirable interactions that negatively impact service quality and user satisfaction. In this paper, we propose an approach for modeling such undesirable interactions as feature interactions. As each functional feature is ultimately motivated by non-functional requirements, we make an explicit distinction between functional and non-functional features. We then describe our approach for detecting and resolving feature interactions among web services. The approach is based on goal-oriented analysis and scenario modeling. It allows us to reason about feature interactions in terms of goal conflicts and feature deployment. Three case studies illustrate the approach. The paper concludes with a discussion of our findings and an outlook on future research. KEYWORDS: Feature Interaction, Web Services, Goal-oriented Analysis, Non-Functional Feature...|$|R
