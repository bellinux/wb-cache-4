5|$|I {{should not}} be {{surprised}} if this were to terminate in my death. I did not expect to encounter what has beset me <b>since</b> <b>my</b> elevation to the Presidency. God knows I have endeavored to fulfill what I conceived to be an honest duty. But I have been mistaken. My motives have been misconstrued, and my feelings most grossly outraged.|$|E
5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship <b>since</b> <b>my</b> childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E
25|$|Yes, it was difficult. The chemo really {{knocked me}} down, but I guess they {{almost have to}} kill you before you can start in your recovery. Everything is great, {{wonderful}} right now. I’m in remission {{and there have been}} no reoccurrences <b>since</b> <b>my</b> surgery. I’m blessed. I’m surrounded by the people I love.|$|E
25|$|Tall, narrow glass {{structures}} were {{a goal of}} modernist architecture <b>since</b> <b>Mies</b> Van Der Rohe proposed a glass skyscraper for Berlin. Such buildings as Gordon Bunshaft's Lever House, Mies' Seagram Building in New York City, and Frank Lloyd Wright's Johnson Wax Headquarters attempted this goal, {{but many of these}} designs retained structural artifacts that prevented a consistent, monolithic look.|$|R

25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>my</b> retirement, I have {{remained}} {{in close contact with}} many of the staff and players on the Galaxy.

25|$|I saw the Curtiss planes {{approximately}} 300 meters {{below us}} and falling away below. These aircraft were {{no threat to}} us whatsoever! Now I just wanted to level out of my turning bank, <b>since</b> <b>my</b> colleagues were already at a substantially higher altitude. Keppler (his wingman), overshot me. Once again, I saw the Curtiss planes 300 meters directly below me and counted eleven aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In February 2011, Ueto {{launched}} {{her fifth}} wedding dress collection. In July 2011, Ueto reprised {{the role of}} detective Izumi Sakuragi for a second season of Zettai Reido. Ueto was confirmed {{to appear in the}} series finale of the long-running drama Wataru Seken wa Oni Bakari, scheduled to air in September 2011. She will also star alongside Hiroshi Abe {{for the first time in}} ten years, <b>since</b> <b>My</b> Little Chef (2002), in the film adaptation of Thermae Romae (2012). Filming started in Rome on March 14 and is expected to finish in early May.|$|E

25|$|One common {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} possibility exists that one might misremember the sensation, and therefore {{one does not have}} any firm criterion for using S in each case. So, for example, I might one day focus on that sensation, and link it to the symbol S; but the next day, I have no criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now {{is the same as the}} one yesterday, except for my memory; and <b>since</b> <b>my</b> memory might fail me, I have no firm criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now is indeed S.|$|E
25|$|In early 2013, Ringwald {{released}} Except Sometimes, a jazz record. It {{follows a}} tradition in jazz for the Ringwald family set by her father. “I {{grew up in a}} home filled with music and had an early appreciation of jazz <b>since</b> <b>my</b> dad was a jazz musician. Beginning at around age three I started singing with his band and jazz music has continued to be one of my three passions along with acting and writing. I like to say jazz music is my musical equivalent of comfort food. It's always where I go back to when I want to feel grounded,” Ringwald said in a statement.|$|E
25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>my</b> {{life as a}} {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard {{the teachings of the}} white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, Binoche {{returned}} to the screen in a big-budget adaptation of Jean Giono's The Horseman on the Roof directed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau. The film was particularly significant in France as {{it was at the}} time the most expensive film in the history of French cinema. The film was a box-office success around the world and Binoche was again nominated for a César for Best Actress. This role, as a romantic heroine, was to color the direction of many of her subsequent roles in the late 1990s. In 1996, Binoche appeared in her first comedic role <b>since</b> <b>My</b> Brother-in-Law Killed My Sister a decade before; A Couch in New York was directed by Chantal Akerman and co-starred William Hurt. This screw-ball comedy {{tells the story of a}} New York psychiatrist who swaps homes with a Parisian dancer. The film was a critical and commercial failure. Three Colors: Blue, The Horseman on the Roof and A Couch in New York all gave Binoche the opportunity to work with prestigious directors she had turned down during the prolonged shoot of Les Amants du Pont-Neuf.|$|E

500|$|In her 1986 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Tina {{was asked about}} her preference in men. She said, [...] "In {{the early part of}} my life, I liked light-skinned guys better than dark-skinned guys. The people I've dated <b>since</b> <b>my</b> divorce have been white because I haven't been in a circle where {{there were a lot of}} black people. I can't say that I'm not still attracted to black men. My preference is a very light-skinned black man. And my preference in white men is blond. But I haven't seen any black or white men that I've liked lately." ...|$|E
500|$|Xhinovci {{joined the}} Kosovo Liberation Army ( [...] ; or KLA) in 1998, and {{fought against the}} Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army (...) {{with the goal of}} {{separating}} Kosovo from Yugoslavia. Xhinovci earned the reputation of a [...] "fierce fighter" [...] and commanded the respect of local Albanians. His comrades gave him the nickname [...] "Hitler" [...] due to his uncanny resemblance to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Xhinovci told journalist Una Hajdari: [...] "People have called me Hitler <b>since</b> <b>my</b> army days. They say I look a lot like him—unlike the English guy who plays him in that movie," [...] apparently a reference to Charlie Chaplin's role in The Great Dictator.|$|E
500|$|Robson {{was created}} a Knight Bachelor in 2002, was {{inducted}} {{as a member}} of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2003, and was the honorary president of Ipswich Town. From 1991 onwards, he suffered recurrent medical problems with cancer, and in March 2008, put his name and efforts into the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, a cancer research charity which has so far collected over £7million (March 2014). In August 2008, his lung cancer was confirmed to be terminal; he said, [...] "My condition is described as static and has not altered <b>since</b> <b>my</b> last bout of chemotherapy... I am going to die sooner rather than later. But then everyone has to go sometime and I have enjoyed every minute." [...] He died just under a year later.|$|E

500|$|Bach {{composed}} his cantata {{as part of}} {{his application}} for the position of [...] in Leipzig, the official title being [...] (Cantor and Director of Music). As cantor, he was responsible for the music at four Lutheran churches, the main churches Thomaskirche (St. Thomas) and the Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas), but also the Neue Kirche (New Church) and the Peterskirche (St. Peter). As director of music, the Thomaskantor was Leipzig's [...] "senior musician", responsible for the music on official occasions such as town council elections and homages. Functions related to the university took place at the Paulinerkirche. The position became vacant when Johann Kuhnau died on 5 June 1722. Bach was interested, mentioning as one reason that he saw more possibilities for future academic studies of his sons in Leipzig: [...] "...but this post was described to me in such favorable terms that finally (particularly <b>since</b> <b>my</b> sons seemed inclined to [...] studies) I cast my lot, {{in the name of the}} Lord, and made my journey to Leipzig, took my examination, and then made the change of position." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{description of}} carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by Aristotle. Documented cases {{of carbon monoxide}} {{being used as a}} method of suicide date to at least 100 BC in ancient Rome. In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor Julian suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work Misopogon: [...] "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat the house, because I was afraid of drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And <b>since</b> <b>my</b> head was filled with the fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside." [...] This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, Jovian.|$|E
500|$|Tracks on {{this album}} include [...] "E Pari Ra", [...] "One Fine Day", [...] "Let Me Lie", [...] "Danny Boy", and [...] "Abide with Me". Westenra co-wrote four of the fifteen tracks, and the album also {{features}} singer Humphrey Berney. The US/Australia/NZ edition followed in March under the name Celtic Treasure. Westenra dedicated the album to her grandmother, Shirley Ireland. Inside the sleeve of the British edition, she wrote: [...] "I come from a musical family, and one with {{a real sense of}} history. My forefathers were on the maiden voyage from Ireland to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1850 – there's even a commemoration plaque in Cathedral Square, Christchurch, which bears the name Westenra. My grandmother used to sit me on her knee and sing songs like Danny Boy from as early as I can remember. A singer herself in her earlier years, she has always been a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to me <b>since</b> <b>my</b> childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album." ...|$|E
