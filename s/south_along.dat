5|$|Bird {{migration}} is the regular seasonal movement, often north and <b>south</b> <b>along</b> a flyway, between breeding and wintering grounds. Many species of bird migrate. Migration carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans, and is driven primarily by availability of food. It occurs {{mainly in the}} northern hemisphere, where birds are funnelled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the Mediterranean Sea or the Caribbean Sea.|$|E

5|$|Business US Highway12 (Bus. US12) was a {{business}} route running in Niles. The western terminus was {{at the corner of}} West Chicago Road and US12 (Pulaski Highway) east of the US12/US31 interchange. From there, the business loop followed Chicago Road northeasterly through residential areas {{on the west side of}} town. Bus. US12 turned north along Lincoln Avenue and then east on Main Street, crossing the St. Joseph River. The loop intersected the southern end of M-139 at Front Street one block east of the river in downtown Niles. Four blocks further east, Bus. US12 met M-51. The two highways merged along Main Street and then turned <b>south</b> <b>along</b> 11th Street at an intersection that also marks the western terminus of Bus. M-60 (Oak Street). Bus. US12/M-51 continued <b>south</b> <b>along</b> 11th Street to the corner of US12 (Pulaski Highway) and M-51 (South 11th Street) where the business loop terminated.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{settlement}} {{period of the}} Niagara area, following the American Revolutionary War, new wagon routes were built over native footpaths. Grimsby and Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) quickly became established settlements, but travel was cumbersome between them.

5|$|In 1947, {{plans were}} made to {{construct}} a freeway, the Washington National Pike (now I-270), parallel to US 240. In 1953, the US 240 freeway was completed between MD 121 in Clarksburg and US 15 (now MD 85) in Frederick. The former alignment of US 240 between Clarksburg and Frederick was designated as US 240 Alt. A year later, the freeway was extended down to MD 118 in Germantown. At this time, the original alignment between Germantown and Frederick was designated MD 355, replacing what was US 240 between Germantown and Clarksburg and {{the entire length of}} US 240 Alt. between Clarksburg and Frederick. The US 240 freeway was extended south to MD 28 in Rockville in 1956, and MD 355 was subsequently extended <b>south</b> <b>along</b> the former alignment to the MD 28 intersection in Rockville. Also, the US 240 freeway was completed from US 15 north to US 40. In 1957, US 240 was upgraded to a divided highway between Bethesda and Rockville. The US 240 freeway was extended south to Montrose Road in 1958, resulting in MD 355 being extended <b>south</b> <b>along</b> the former alignment to Montrose Road. I-70S was designated onto the US 240 freeway in 1959. In addition, MD 355 was extended north to US 15 north of Frederick, passing through the city on Market Street, the one-way pair of Market Street northbound and Bentz Street southbound in the downtown, and Market Street to the north of downtown. The route replaced US 15/US 240 south of downtown Fredrick and US 15 north of downtown Frederick, with US 15 shifted to a bypass west of the city. In 1960, I-70S/US 240 was extended south to the Capital Beltway, and MD 355 was extended <b>south</b> <b>along</b> former US 240 between Montrose Road and the Capital Beltway.|$|E

5|$|In December 1934, at {{the insistence}} of the Automobile Club of New York, several {{numbered}} routes were extended and signed within New York City, with NY22 being one of these routes. NY22 was extended south from the Mount Vernon line in the Bronx along White Plains Road, then it shifted via East 233rd Street to Webster Avenue until Fordham Road (US1). From Fordham Road, it continued <b>south</b> <b>along</b> the Grand Concourse (overlapped with NY100), crossing into Manhattan via East 149th Street to the 145th Street Bridge. In Manhattan, the NY22/100 pair continued <b>south</b> <b>along</b> Lenox Avenue, 110th Street, Fifth Avenue, 96th Street, and Park Avenue, ending at Houston Street (NY1A). By 1941, the alignment within Mount Vernon was shifted east to use Columbus Avenue and South 3rd Avenue (current NY22), continuing its route to New York City via East 233rd Street as before. On January1, 1970, the NY22 designation was removed from Manhattan and most of the Bronx, and the short piece remaining in the city was realigned to meet US1 at its current southern terminus.|$|E
5|$|NY251 was {{truncated}} to {{its present}} terminus in Scottsville on July 1, 1977, {{at which time}} NY386 was extended <b>south</b> <b>along</b> the former routing of NY251 to Scottsville.

This part of NY386 is maintained by Monroe County as the unsigned County Route158 (CR158).|$|E
