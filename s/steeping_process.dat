The characteristics of this process are based on physical separation of components, mostly on weight and size. The higher amount of water is needed as it is a wet process and it works as separation/carrier agents in washing steps. Therefore, this process can be considered as having high capital cost. The only chemical use in this process is aqueous sulfur dioxide solution which used in the <b>steeping</b> <b>process.</b> The corn was soaked in this solution just to the softened kernel so that the oil in the germ will not contaminate other product and easy to separate.|$|E
50|$|A teapot is {{a vessel}} used for {{steeping}} tea leaves or an herbal mix in boiling or near-boiling water, and for serving the resulting infusion {{which is called}} tea. Dry tea is available either in tea bags or as loose tea, in which case a tea infuser or tea strainer may be of some assistance, either to hold the leaves as they steep or to catch the leaves inside the teapot when the tea is poured. Teapots usually have an opening with a lid at their top, where the dry tea and hot water are added, a handle for holding by hand and a spout through which the tea is served. Some teapots have a strainer built-in on the inner edge of the spout. A small air hole in the lid is often created to stop the spout from dripping and splashing when tea is poured. In modern times, a thermal cover called a tea cosy {{may be used to}} enhance the <b>steeping</b> <b>process</b> or to prevent the contents of the teapot from cooling too rapidly.|$|E

40|$|An {{artificial}} {{neural network}} (ANN) based on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture is used for detecting steep spindles in band-pass filtered electroencephalograms (EEG), without feature extraction. Following optimum classification schemes, {{the sensitivity of the}} network ranges from 79. 2 % to 87. 5 %, while the false positive rate ranges from 3. 8 % to 15. 5 %. Furthermore, due to the operation of the ANN on time-domain EEG data, there is agreement with visual assessment concerning temporal resolution. Specifically, the total inter-spindle interval duration and the total duration of spindles are calculated with 99 % and 92 % accuracy, respectively. Therefore, the present method may be suitable for investigations of the dynamics among successive inter-spindle intervals, which could provide information on the role of spindles in the <b>steep</b> <b>process,</b> and for studies of pharmacological effects on steep structure, as revealed by the modification of total spindle duration.

50|$|Patented by Charles A. Seely, {{this process}} {{achieves}} treatment by immersing seasoned wood in successive baths of {{hot and cold}} preservatives. During the hot baths, the air expands in the timbers. When the timbers are changed to the cold bath (the preservative can also be changed) a partial vacuum is created within the lumen of the cells, causing the preservative {{to be drawn into}} the wood. Some penetration occurs during the hot baths, but most of it takes place during the cold baths. This cycle is repeated with a significant time reduction compared to other <b>steeping</b> <b>processes.</b> Each bath may last 4 to 8 hours or in some cases longer. The temperature of the preservative in the hot bath should be between 60 to 110 C and 30 to 40 C in the cold bath (depending on preservative and tree species). The average penetration depths achieved with this process ranges from 30 to 50 mm. Both preservative oils and water-soluble salts can be used with this treatment. Due to the longer treatment periods, this method finds little use in the commercial wood preservation industry today.|$|R
5000|$|Mashing is {{the process}} of {{combining}} a mix of milled grain (typically malted barley with supplementary grains such as corn, sorghum, rye or wheat), known as the [...] "grain bill", and water, known as [...] "liquor", and heating this mixture in a vessel called a [...] "mash tun". Mashing is a form of steeping, and defines the act of brewing, such as with making tea, sake, and soy sauce. Technically, wine, cider and mead are not brewed but rather vinified, as there is no <b>steeping</b> <b>process</b> involving solids. Mashing allows the enzymes in the malt to break down the starch in the grain into sugars, typically maltose to create a malty liquid called wort. There are two main methods - infusion mashing, in which the grains are heated in one vessel; and decoction mashing, in which a proportion of the grains are boiled and then returned to the mash, raising the temperature. Mashing involves pauses at certain temperatures (notably 45 - 62 - 73 C), and takes place in a [...] "mash tun" [...] - an insulated brewing vessel with a false bottom. The end product of mashing is called a [...] "mash".|$|E

Therefore, to provide scientific data for the utilization of goji berry in the nutraceutical industry, the diffusion rate of betaine, β-carotene, phenolic compounds in goji berry and their antioxidant capacities affected by alcohol concentration and steeping time were determined by UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The results showed that low alcohol concentration (15 % or 25 %) would promote the diffusion of betaine and increase antioxidant activity, while high concentration (55 % or 65 %) would generally increase the diffusion of flavonoids and reduce antioxidant activity. The steeping time had no significant effect on the diffusion of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities.

40|$|THE {{purpose of}} this report is to pre-sent data showing the effect of corn {{fermentation}} condensed solubles in the diet of growing chickens. As early as 1954 Combs and co-workers reported the presence of unidentified growth factors in a "grain fermentation solubles product. " More recently, Camp et al. (1957), reported the presence of growth factor(s) in liquid corn steep-water as evidenced by chick growth stim-ulation when this ingredient was added to a practical-type diet. Corn fermentation condensed solubles is a product derived from corn prior to processing the grain for manufacture of starches, sugars and syrups. The {{first step in the}} wet milling of corn is the <b>steeping</b> <b>process.</b> This is the extrac-tion of the water-soluble fraction of corn. The grain is soaked in dilute sulfurous acid at pH 4. 0 for about 40 hours at 125 °F. Steeping removes from the corn essen-tially all of the water soluble components. These represent approximately 6. 5 per-cent of the weight of corn processed. During the steeping cycle, there is a build up of native organisms that thrive in the environment created and, among other things, they convert part of the available reducing sugars extracted from the grain to lactic acid. The corn fermentation solubles fraction is condensed by removal of moisture to approximately 50 percent solids. Corn fermentation condensed solubles is a brown colored, somewhat thixotropic liquid.

40|$|The cereal sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) (L.) Moench) is a {{critically}} important food crop in sub-Saharan Africa {{on account of}} its drought tolerance. The increased use of sorghum as a food in this region could alleviate the problem of chronic under nourishment, as sorghum is much better suited to cultivation in the semi-arid tropics than non-indigenous cereals such as wheat or maize. However, a problem with sorghum is {{that the quality of}} its protein, in terms of digestibility is inferior to that of other cereal foods, especially when sorghum foods are cooked. Research conducted within EC INCO-DC PROJECT “Improvement of the protein quality of sorghum and its introduction into staple food products for southern and eastern Africa ” showed that malting, in addition to improving the malt quality characteristics (e. g. diastatic power and free amino nitrogen), improved the digestibility and quality of the protein, which generally increased with increasing malting time. In one of the sorghum varieties studied in vitro protein digestibility was improved by a staggering 110 %. Malting similarly improved other protein quality characteristics, including percentage protein, the nitrogen solubility index and the content of the first limiting amino acid, lysine. Soaking sorghum grain for a relatively short period during the <b>steeping</b> <b>process</b> in a dilute solution of NaOH was found to significantly improve the beneficial effects of malting in terms of diastatic power and free amino nitrogen and to marginally enhance the beneficial effect of malting on the protein quality and digestibility.

40|$|The {{paper offers}} a new {{approach}} to handling difficult parametric inverse problems in elasticity and thermo-elasticity, formulated as global optimization ones. The proposed strategy is composed of two phases. In the first, global phase, the stochastic hp-HGS algorithm recognizes the basins of attraction of various objective minima. In the second phase, the local objective minimizers are closer approached by <b>steepest</b> descent <b>processes</b> executed singly in each basin of attraction. The proposed complex strategy is especially dedicated to ill-posed problems with multimodal objective functionals. The strategy offers comparatively low computational and memory costs resulting from a double-adaptive technique in both forward and inverse problem domains. We provide a result on the Lipschitz continuity of the objective functional composed of the elastic energy and the boundary displacement misfits with respect to the unknown constitutive parameters. It allows common scaling of the accuracy of solving forward and inverse problems, which is the core of the introduced double-adaptive technique. The capability of the proposed method of finding multiple solutions is illustrated by a computational example which consists in restoring all feasible Young modulus distributions minimizing an objective functional in a 3 D domain of a photo polymer template obtained during step and flash imprint lithography...|$|R

40|$|Pulsars show {{two classes}} of {{rotational}} irregularities {{that can be used}} to understand neutron-star interiors and magnetospheres: glitches and timing noise. Here we present an analysis of the Vela pulsar spanning nearly 21 yr of observation and including 8 glitches. We identify the relative pulse number of all of the observations between glitches, with the only pulse-number ambiguities existing over glitch events. We use the phase coherence of the timing solution to simultaneously model the timing noise and glitches in a Bayesian framework, allowing us to select preferred models for both. We find the glitches can be described using only permanent and transient changes in spin frequency, i. e., no step changes in frequency derivative. For all of the glitches, we only need two exponentially decaying changes in spin frequency to model the transient components. In contrast to previous studies, we find that the dominant transient components decay on a common ≈ 1300 d time scale, and that a larger fraction (≳ 25 %) of glitch amplitudes are associated with these transient components. We also detect shorter-duration transient components of ≈ 25 d, as previously observed, but are limited in sensitivity to events with shorter durations by the cadence of our observations. The timing noise is well described by a <b>steep</b> power-law <b>process</b> that is independent of the glitches and subdominant to the glitch recovery.

40|$|Abstract: Large wood {{recruitment}} and redistribution mechanisms were investigated in a 3. 9 km 2 basin with an oldgrowth Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco and Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg. forest, {{located in the}} southern Coast Range of Oregon. Stream size and topographic setting strongly influenced processes that delivered wood to the channel network. In small colluvial channels draining <b>steep</b> hillslopes, <b>processes</b> associated with slope instability dominated large wood recruitment. In the larger alluvial channel, windthrow was the dominant recruitment process from the local riparian area. Consequently, colluvial channels received wood from further upslope than the alluvial channel. Input and redistribution processes influenced piece location relative to the direction of flow and thus, affected the functional role of wood. Wood recruited directly from local hillslopes and riparian areas was typically positioned adjacent to the channel or spanned its full width, and trapped sediment and wood in transport. In contrast, wood that had been fluvially redistributed was commonly located in mid-channel positions and was associated with scouring of the streambed and banks. Debris flows were a unique mechanism for creating large accumulations of wood in small streams that lacked the capacity for abundant fluvial transport of wood, and for transporting wood that was longer than the bank-full width of the channel.

We also began some work with paper mill sludge as a cellulose source, and in some preliminary experiments obtained 23 g/L ethanol during SSF of the sludge. During year 2, a 130 L process scale unit will be operated to demonstrate the process using straw or cornstalks.

40|$|Performance of neuraxial {{blockade}} using a midline {{approach can}} be technically difficult. It is therefore important to optimize factors that are {{under the influence of}} the clinician performing the procedure. One of these factors might be the chosen point of insertion of the needle. Surprisingly few data exist on where between the tips of two adjacent spinous processes the needle should be introduced. A geometrical model was adopted to gain more insight into this issue. Spinous processes were represented by parallelograms. The length, the steepness relative to the skin, and the distance between the parallelograms were varied. The influence of the chosen point of insertion of the needle on the range of angles at which the epidural and subarachnoid space could be reached was studied. The optimal point of insertion was defined as the point where this range is the widest. The geometrical model clearly demonstrated, that the range of angles at which the epidural or subarachnoid space can be reached, is dependent on the point of insertion between the tips of the adjacent spinous <b>processes.</b> The <b>steeper</b> the spinous <b>processes</b> run, the more cranial the point of insertion should be. Assuming that the model is representative for patients, the performance of neuraxial blockade using a midline approach might be improved by choosing the optimal point of insertion...|$|R
40|$|Al-Qaeda was {{initially}} formed {{not as a}} terrorist organization, but as an independent Islamist military faction (Bergen 2 ̆ 6 Cruickshank, 2012). The organization evolved around {{the ideology of the}} central and supreme leader Osama bin Laden (Bergen 2 ̆ 6 Cruickshank, 2012). However, the ability for the group to change and adapt to different environments and cultures has allowed for the organization to spread especially to Western audiences (Bergen 2 ̆ 6 Cruickshank, 2012). The evolution of their media strategy is the epitome of how al-Qaeda is adaptable (Torres, Jordán, 2 ̆ 6 Horsburgh, 2006). The shift from centralized distribution of pamphlets to video and audio tapes to television and then to the Internet has allowed al-Qaeda to use the process of self-radicalization to its advantage (Lieberman 2 ̆ 6 Collins, 2008). The Internet allows people to trade ideas internationally with one another without being located geographically near one another (Lieberman 2 ̆ 6 Collins, 2008). The process is very much <b>steeped</b> in psychological <b>processes</b> that have the potential to be stopped at any of the three main steps (Lieberman 2 ̆ 6 Collins, 2008). Three methods for halting self-radicalization including censorship of information, public education, and intelligence gathering are all examined (Neumann, 2013). The potential for backlash is great, but there is an endless array of benefits that can be achieved through a well-orchestrated public awareness campaign about the process of self-radicalization...|$|R
40|$|Steepest descent {{preconditioning}} {{is considered}} for the recently proposed nonlinear generalized minimal residual (N-GMRES) optimization algorithm for unconstrained nonlinear optimization. Two steepest descent preconditioning variants are proposed. The first employs a line search, whereas the second employs a predefined small step. A simple global convergence proof is provided for the N-GMRES optimization algorithm with the first steepest descent preconditioner (with line search), under mild standard conditions on the objective function and the line search <b>processes.</b> <b>Steepest</b> descent preconditioning for N-GMRES optimization is also motivated by relating it to standard non-preconditioned GMRES for linear systems {{in the case of}} a standard quadratic optimization problem with symmetric positive definite operator. Numerical tests on a variety of model problems show that the N-GMRES optimization algorithm is able to very significantly accelerate convergence of stand-alone steepest descent optimization. Moreover, performance of steepest-descent preconditioned N-GMRES is shown to be competitive with standard nonlinear conjugate gradient and limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno methods for the model problems considered. These results serve to theoretically and numerically establish steepest-descent preconditioned N-GMRES as a general optimization method for unconstrained nonlinear optimization, with performance that appears promising compared with established techniques. In addition, it is argued that the real potential of the N-GMRES optimization framework lies in the fact that it can make use of problem-dependent nonlinear preconditioners that are more powerful than steepest descent (or, equivalently, N-GMRES can be used as a simple wrapper around any other iterative optimization process to seek acceleration of that process), an...|$|R
