6000|$|... 1383. A glass vessel a (fig. 127.)[A] was {{ground at}} the top and bottom so as to be closed by two ground brass plates, b and c; b carried a <b>stuffing-box,</b> with a sliding rod d {{terminated}} by a brass ball s below, and a ring above. The lower plate was connected with a foot, stop-cock, and socket, e, f and g; and also with a brass ball l, which by means of a stem attached to it and entering the socket g, could be fixed at various heights. The metallic parts of this apparatus were not varnished, but the glass was well-covered with a coat of shell-lac previously dissolved in alcohol. On exhausting the vessel at the air-pump it could be filled with any other gas than air, and, in such cases, the gas so passed in was dried whilst entering by fused chloride of calcium.|$|E
6000|$|... 1506. Similar {{experiments}} {{to those in}} air (1485. 1493.) were made in different gases, the results of which I will describe as briefly as possible. The apparatus is represented fig. 131, consisting of a bell-glass eleven inches in diameter at the widest part, and ten {{and a half inches}} high up {{to the bottom of the}} neck. The balls are lettered, as in fig. 130, and are in the same relation to each other; but A and B were on separate sliding wires, which, however, were generally joined by a cross wire, w, above, and that connected with the brass conductor, which received its positive or negative charge from the machine. The rods of A and B were graduated at the part moving through the <b>stuffing-box,</b> so that the application of a diagonal scale applied there, told what was the distance between these balls and those beneath them. As to the position of the balls in the jar, and their relation to each other, C and D were three and a quarter inches apart, their height above the pump plate five inches, and the distance between any of the balls and the glass of the jar one inch and three quarters at least, and generally more. The balls A and D were two inches in diameter, as before (1493.); the balls B and C only 0.15 of an inch in diameter.|$|E
5000|$|An {{improved}} {{construction of}} pump for lifting and forcing, {{in which the}} use of a branch-pipe and <b>stuffing-box,</b> as ordinarily employed, is dispensed with the branch in which the handle works being provided with a vulcanised India-rubber tube surrounding the handle at the joint, so as to prevent leakage.|$|E
50|$|The {{lower part}} of the bow of the vessel, instead of being made solid as usual, is {{composed}} of two iron flaps, each hinged at the top, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. When closed, the outer surfaces of these flaps correspond to the general shape of the bow, and, when the torpedo machinery is not being worked, they are kept down in their places by means of chains attached to them near their lower edges, and passing in through a pair of hawsepipes situated between the flaps. Each chain, after entering its hawsepipe, is attached to an iron rod, these rods passing into the vessel through <b>stuffing-boxes</b> at the inner ends of the hawsepipes. From the inner ends of these rods chains are led, over guide pulleys, to the ends of a winch, situated as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, and by means of this winch, which is worked by hand, the flaps can be closed when required. The opening of the flaps is effected by the arrangements shown in Figs. 1 and 4, from which it will be seen that each flap has a chain attached to its outside, and that these chains, after being led up over guide pulleys supported by brackets placed {{at the level of the}} gunwale, are crossed and then led down through hawseholes in the deck to the winch below. The chains for opening, in fact, form continuations of those for closing the flaps, or vice versa.|$|R
40|$|There are two {{distinct}} {{modes of operation}} of a <b>stuffing-box</b> seal. One mode occurs when the axial pressures produced in the packing by tightening the gland-bush are greater than the sealed fluid pressure and the other when they are less. Under the former conditions the fluid pressure distribution is an exponential function of the packed length and the frictional torque increases rapidly with this quantity. With high fluid pressures, however, the relation between fluid pressure and packed length is no longer exponential {{and most of the}} fluid pressure drop occurs over the last 10 per cent of the packed length. In addition very little increase in frictional torque occurs when the packed length is increased. Theoretical expressions have been derived for pressure distribution and friction torque and good agreement has been obtained between these and experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Large rotary {{processors}} such like rotary dryers, rotary calciners and kilns {{are difficult}} to seal properly because of their large diameter, their low precision methods of fabrication and their severe operating conditions. Those factors result in several types of imperfection at the sealing surface. This work explores the possibility to seal large rotary processors to positive pressure up to 1 atmosphere (14. 7 psig). First, an extensive theoretical analysis combined with on-site measurements evaluation was conducted to quantify the magnitude of each type of surface imperfection at the seal location. Against these results, the current typical seals used in the industry were evaluated and compared. The seals that featured compressed packing seals seem to show great possibility as they are already used in successful positive pressure large seal arrangement. A typical packing seal arrangement with a <b>stuffing-box</b> was studied thoroughly {{in order to understand}} its particularities. The data collected and calculated in the previous steps was gathered and settled the new seal requirements. A new seal arrangement is proposed and it features as principal characteristics: radial compression and adaptive flexible housing. Based on the <b>stuffing-box</b> available mathematical relations, the equations are re-evaluated to account for the new radially oriented arrangement. Meanwhile, a test rig is designed and built to measure the seal performance and observe its behaviour. The effect of several parameters can be studied such as temperature, gas pressure, magnitude of sealing surface imperfection, magnitude of radial compression and drum rotation speed. Finally, tests are conducted and the results are discussed {{in order to make a}} recommendation for the possible industrial application. In the light of this study the new proposed seal meets or surpasses the industrial application requirements. The performance of the full scale 1. 952 m (76. 875 in) seal are projected as follow; a leak rate of 114 ml/sec (0. 24 scfm) at 0. 69 MPag (10 psig), 4 kW (5 HP) of power loss in friction, half a year of longevity before maintenance and a deformations absorption greater than 3. 15 mm (0. 125 in) in the radial direction...|$|E
40|$|There the {{purposes}} are {{to study the}} operation and the pressure distribution in the multistage gasket under the constant and alternating pressure, to study the operation of isolated gasket under the alternating pressure, to explore the off-loading both the multistage and isolated gasket from the alternating pressure, the off-loading the gasket on the non-processed surface; to develop the new constructions on this basis. The generalized approach to the operation of isolated and multichamber gasket under the conditions of alternating pressure has been developed; the manner to rise the durability of gaskets by way of off-loading both the isolated and multistage gasket from the pulsating pressure has been developed; the generalized coefficient of smoothing of pressure pulsation has been determined; the serviceability of gaskets on the non-processed surface of ammoniacal main has been showed by experiment. The new constructions of gaskets have been developed and have been created for the next equipment of nitrogen industry, they are the high-pressure compressors, the high-pressure pumps, the centrifugal pumps (the mechanical gaskets), the ammoniacal main (the compensation <b>stuffing-box</b> seals).

40|$|Lecturepg. 81 The {{pulp and}} paper {{industry}} as well as all other industry branches are subject to continuous, ongoing development. Mechanical seals have already replaced <b>stuffing-box</b> packings in virtually all {{pulp and paper}} factories in Europe, as well as in {{a very large number of}} production plants throughout the world. The advantages gained through the use of mechanical seals for example lower leakage rates, friction output, and maintenance outlay make a significant contribution toward sparing both environment and resources while enabling more economic production operations. The chemical and petrochemical industries have already shown the way in this respect with impressive success. Yet these branches have had experience with mechanical seals for a long time and are using closed loop seal supply systems to keep the buffer fluid in its place, in contrast to the {{pulp and paper industry}} where most systems consist of a mechanical seal, a control device to adjust buffer flowrate and pressure, and drainage where the buffer water goes after it leaves the seal. This results in high water consumption for mechanical seals in pulp and paper mills. The dead-end seal is a kind of ?closed-loop-system? in itself and has proven to save a lot of seal water (and, with this, money) in several applications, not only in the pulp and paper industry. A description of the dead-end seal, its operation ranged, and plant studies are presented. The plant histories discuss economic, environmental, and reliability benefits achieved from using the dead-end seal in different fields of application...|$|E
