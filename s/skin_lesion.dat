25|$|Cutaneous anthrax {{infection}} in humans shows up as a boil-like <b>skin</b> <b>lesion</b> that eventually forms an ulcer {{with a black}} center (eschar), often beginning as an irritating and itchy <b>skin</b> <b>lesion</b> or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot. Cutaneous infections generally form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Without treatment about 20% of cutaneous skin infection cases progress to toxemia and death. Respiratory {{infection in}} humans initially presents with cold or flu-like symptoms for several days, followed by severe (and often fatal) respiratory collapse. Historical mortality was 92%. Gastrointestinal infection in humans is most often caused by eating anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by serious gastrointestinal difficulty, vomiting of blood, severe diarrhea, acute inflammation of the intestinal tract, and loss of appetite. After the bacteria invades the bowel system, it spreads through the bloodstream throughout the body, making more toxins on the way.|$|E

25|$|Keratinophilic fungal {{species that}} {{fall under the}} genus Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, or Microsporum, are {{pathogenic}} to humans and other animals, and {{are referred to as}} dermatophytes {{on the basis of their}} ability to cause dermatophytosis in these hosts. However, infections in these hosts caused by soil-derived keratinophilic saprotrophs like A.fulvescens are very seldom and only a few cases have been documented in the literature. The first documented case of A.fulvescens causing tinea corporis was in 1970 when the fungus was repeatedly isolated from a 4 x 5cm red patch on the inner right thigh of a 21-year-old white male. This case showcases the clinical importance of non-dermatophyte keratinophilic fungi such as A.fulvescens as a result of the ability to cause dermatophytosis in the form of tinea corporis in humans. While visually, the case of tinea corporis was indistinguishable from those caused by true dermatophytes, the infection did not respond well to typical treatment.

40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of groundwater in south Asia is contaminated with arsenic. Pakistan has low levels of arsenic in groundwater compared with China, Bangladesh and India.

The geographical distribution of the <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> and arsenic-contaminated wells in the district were ascertained using global positioning system.

The prevalence of <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> of arsenic was estimated for complex survey design, using surveyfreq and surveylogistic options of SAS 9. 1 software. The prevalence of definitive cases i. e. hyperkeratosis of both palms and soles, was 3. 4 per 1000 and suspected cases i. e. any sign of arsenic <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> (melanosis and/or keratosis), were 13. 0 per 1000 among 3 ̆e= 15 -year-old persons in the district.

40|$|SUMMARY BACKGROUND: Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} number of reports regarding adverse skin reactions to subcutaneous heparin administration. Case series have implied that heparin-induced <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> are predominantly associated with life-threatening heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) in at least 22 % of patients. <b>Skin</b> <b>lesions,</b> therefore, have been included in clinical scores for HIT. OBJECTIVES: To determine the association of heparin-induced <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> with HIT. This would have a pivotal impact on further anticoagulatory management in patients with heparin-induced <b>skin</b> <b>lesions.</b> PATIENTS/METHODS: In our observational cohort study, 87 consecutive patients with heparin-induced <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> (85 occurring during low-molecular-weight heparin administration) were evaluated using a standardized internal protocol, including HIT diagnostics (heparin-platelet factor 4 -ELISA, heparin-induced platelet activation assay), platelet count monitoring, clinical/sonographical screening for thrombosis, skin allergy testing and, if necessary, histology. Results: None of the observed heparin-induced <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> was due to HIT; all lesions were caused by delayed-type IV-hypersensitivity reactions (DTH) instead. Even the cutaneous reaction in one patient with concomitant HIT could be classified histologically as DTH reaction, amounting to an association of heparin-induced <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> and HIT in 1. 2 % (1 / 87; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 00 - 0. 06). CONCLUSION: Heparin-induced <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> associated with use of low-molecular-weight heparins {{do not seem to be}} strongly associated with a systemic immunologic reaction in terms of HIT and might rather be due to DTH reactions than due to microvascular thrombosis. Hence, we propose refining existing pretest probability scores for HIT, unless underlying causes have been clarified...|$|R

40|$|The {{coexistence}} of cutaneous and extra-cutaneous malignancies within one family {{could be explained}} by shared genetic mechanisms such as common tumor suppressor gene mutations or oncogene activation, as well as mutations in DNA repair genes. Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNPCC) and its variant Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) are caused by germline DNA mismatch repair gene mutations. Colonic and endometrial tumors from HNPCC patients exhibit microsatellite instability (MSI), as do sebaceous lesions in MTS. We recruited individuals from cancer prone families to determine if MSI is found in benign and malignant <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> and to assess whether MSI in the skin is predictive of genomic instability with susceptibility to tumors characteristic of HNPCC.

40|$|Background : Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with multiorgan involvement. The skin {{is the second}} most commonly affected organ. SLE with <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> can produce considerable morbidity resulting from painful <b>skin</b> <b>lesions,</b> alopecia, disfigurement, etc. <b>Skin</b> <b>lesions</b> in patients with lupus may be specific (LE specific) or may be non specific (LE non specific). Acute cutaneous LE (Lupus specific) has a strong association with systemic disease and non-specific <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> always indicate disease activity for which patients present to rheumatologists and internists. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the cutaneous manifestations of SLE is essential for most efficient management. Aims: The aims of this study were to evaluate the patterns and prevalence of <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> in patients with SLE and to assess the relationship between <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> and other systemic involvement. Materials and Methods: At the Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, IPGME&R in Kolkata, 150 patients with SLE fulfilling the clinical and laboratory criteria of the American Rheumatology Association (updated 1982) were examined and followed-up for cutaneous manifestations between January 2002 and January 2007. Results: <b>Skin</b> <b>lesions</b> were important clinical features. About 45 patients (30 &#x 0025;) presented with <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> although all patients had <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> during the follow-up period. Skin changes noted were as follows: Lupus specific lesions: malar rash in 120 patients (80 &#x 0025;), photosensitive dermatitis in 75 patients (50 &#x 0025;), generalized maculopapular rash in 40 patients (26. 67 &#x 0025;), discoid rash in 30 patients (20 &#x 0025;), subacute cutaneous {{lupus erythematosus}} (SCLE) in 5 patients (3. 34 &#x 0025;), lupus profundus in 5 patients (3. 34 &#x 0025;). The lupus non-specific lesions were non-scarring alopecia in 130 patients (86. 67 &#x 0025;), oral ulcers in 85 patients (56. 67 &#x 0025;), vasculitic lesions in 50 patients (33. 34 &#x 0025;), bullous lesions in 15 patients (10 &#x 0025;), Raynaud&#x 2032;s phenomenon in 10 patients (6. 67 &#x 0025;), pyoderma gangrenosum in 2 patients (1. 34 &#x 0025;), erythema multiforme in 10 patients (6. 67 &#x 0025;), and nail fold infarcts in 2 patients (1. 34 &#x 0025;); however, mucosal discoid lupus, lichenoid discoid lupus, livedo reticularis, sclerodactyly, etc. were not detected.
