30|$|Metadata {{exists in}} most {{knowledge}} sectors and has unique specifications and standards {{depending on the}} domain. In geographical domains, the international standard ISO 19115 (we describe it in details in “ISO 19115 ” section) is relatively mature, several GIS software implement it, and is used by practitioners. Its use is however mostly restrained to 2 D datasets (both raster and vector), 3 D datasets very rarely have metadata information stored. One cause is probably because, as highlighted by Danko [7], the specifications of ISO 19115 do not cover several aspects specified to 3 D datasets. If we consider specifically 3 D city models then {{we can state that}} metadata are almost never stored. One probably cause is that CityGML, the international standard for storing them [22], offers no mechanisms to store metadata in a structured way. Practitioners often need to define their own definitions for CityGML metadata and create their own methodology for storing it [11, 25]. Metadata is also necessary in the development of CityGML extensions in order to track and manage the diversity of data sources and data qualities [20]. As further explained in “CityGML, ADEs, and metadata support” section, only a generic “container” for metadata can be used, and any XML elements can be used. This is ironic because, in our opinion, CityGML files would most benefit from having (structured) metadata explicitly stored: in practice the size and the complexity of a given CityGML file are way larger and higher than a 2 D dataset of the same region. This means that parsing an unknown CityGML dataset to extract information is no easy task for practitioners. Currently, we have observed that many people write their own parsers {{and a great deal of}} time is lost on simply analysing a dataset to understand what it contains; examples are the bounding box, the year of creation, the levels of detail in the dataset, etc. Also, because they are too big, many real-world datasets <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> opened by text editors, let alone be visualised by a GIS viewer. While several datasets are tiled into subparts, e.g. the openly available dataset of Berlin 1, they are still very large in size, often 5 GB+ for a single tile. Having metadata attached to the CityGML file would help in assessing the fitness-for-purpose of data for use within a specific application.|$|R

40|$|Characterization {{of surface}} alpha {{emitting}} contamination inside enclosed spaces such as piping systems presents an interesting radiological measurement challenge. Detection of these alpha particles from {{the exterior of}} the pipe is impossible since the alpha particles are completely absorbed by the pipe wall. Traditional survey techniques, using hand-held instruments, <b>simply</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used effectively inside pipes. Science and Engineering Associates, Inc. is currently developing an enhancement to its Pipe Explorer{trademark} system that will address this challenge. The Pipe Explorer{trademark} uses a unique sensor deployment method where an inverted tubular membrane is propagated through complex pipe runs via air pressure. The inversion process causes the membrane to fold out against the pipe wall, such that no part of the membrane drags along the pipe wall. This deployment methodology has been successfully demonstrated at several DOE sites to transport specially designed beta and gamma scintillation detectors into pipes ranging in length up to 250 ft. The measurement methodology under development overcomes the limitations associated with conventional hand-held survey instruments by remotely emplacing an alpha scintillator in direct contact with the interior pipe surface over the entire length to be characterized. This is accomplished by incorporating a suitable scintillator into the otherwise clear membrane material. Alpha particles emitted from the interior pipe surface will intersect the membrane, resulting in the emission of light pulses from the scintillator. A photodetector, towed by the inverting membrane, is used to count these light pulses as a function of distance into the pipe, thereby producing a log of the surface alpha contamination levels. It is anticipated that the resulting system will be able to perform measurements in pipes as small as two inches in diameter, and several hundred feet in length...|$|E

In these models {{it is difficult}} or impossible to deal formally with several central issues: measurements {{in the middle of}} the computation; decoherence and noise, using probabilistic subroutines, and more. It turns out, that the restriction to unitary gates and pure states is unnecessary. In this paper we generalize the formal model of quantum circuits to a model in which the state can be a general quantum state, namely a mixed state, or a "density matrix", and the gates can be general quantum operations, not necessarily unitary. The new model is shown to be equivalent in computational power to the standard one, and the problems mentioned above essentially disappear. The main result in this paper is a solution for the subroutine problem. The general function that a quantum circuit outputs is a probabilistic function. However, the question of using probabilistic functions as subroutines was not previously dealt with, the reason being that in the language of pure states, this <b>simply</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> done. We define a natural notion of using general subroutines, and show that using general subroutines does not strengthen the model. As an example of the advantages of analyzing quantum complexity using density matrices, we prove a simple lower bound on depth of circuits that compute probabilistic functions. Finally, we deal with the question of inaccurate quantum computation with mixed states. Using the so called "trace metric" on density matrices, we show how to keep track of errors in the new model.

As in a classic Hollywood movie the game starts with the end, the winning situation, and {{throughout the rest of the}} game the player is guided by a voice-over narrating in retrospect the events as the player experiences them (3). The rules of the game are all but clear; staying alive seems to be the one objective of the gameplay. So if any game is narrative, "Max Payne" is, but is it a quest game? If so, it is a very different kind of quest than the ones that Ragnhild Tronstad is talking about, and one must distinguish between the player’s quest and the avatar/main character’s quest. In puzzle-solving quests the central problems of the quest are identical for the player and the main character. However, while the central character in "Max Payne" is on a complex film noir quest of unraveling conspiracy and dealing with his own guilt, most of the player’s quest can be described with an algorithm consisting of the three instructions ‘walk’, ‘aim’ and ‘shoot’. I do not wish to discard the fundamental ontological divide between games and narratives that Aarseth and other ludologists have argued convincingly for. However I wish to focus on the way in which story and game can be integrated in each other in hybrid forms that are indeed new media, with equal emphasis on both words. I suggest that a different concept should be used to describe the pleasure of using such media; the concept of enacting. Disregarding the story aspect of these games may contribute just as much to the perception of computer games as an inferior art form as disregarding the ludus aspect; for even if these games tell stories, they do it in ways that are significantly different from traditional storytelling. Interestingly, "Max Payne" uses game design techniques with similarities to those proposed by Gonzalo Frasca for the purpose of developing "serious" games (4). Thus "Max Payne" is able to create something – wether you call it a "gamestory" (5) or a "story cleverly disguised as a game" (6) – that needs to be studied from more than one perspective to be fully understood.

We present a model and show empirical evidence explaining this phenomenon. Checking account evidence shows that debit cards are used {{as a tool to}} restrain overspending. We also test whether the overspending is behavioral or cost-based. In the rational model, consumers use debit to avoid costly budgeting, thus spending control is a cost-driven motivation for using debit cards. In the behavioral model, some consumers <b>simply</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> control spending without a restraining device. The data supports spending control as a motive for debit use, however, the data does not provide conclusive evidence for the rational or behavioral explanations...|$|R
