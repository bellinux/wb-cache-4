40|$|Diffuse metal {{pollution}} from mining impacted sediment is widely recognised {{as a potential}} source of contamination to river systems and may significantly hinder the achievement of European Union Water Framework Directive objectives. Redox-transitional zones that form along metal contaminated river banks {{as a result of}} flood and drought cycles could cause biogeochemical changes that alter the behaviour of polyvalent metals iron and manganese and anions such as sulphur. Trace metals are often partitioned with iron, manganese and <b>sulphur</b> <b>minerals</b> in mining-contaminated sediment, therefore the dissolution and precipitation of these minerals may influence the mobility of potentially toxic trace metals. Research indicates that freshly precipitated metal oxides and sulphides may be more “reactive” (more adsorbent and prone to dissolution when conditions change) than older crystalline forms. Fluctuations at the oxic-anoxic interface brought about through changes in the frequency and duration of flood and drought episodes may therefore influence the reactivity of secondary minerals that form in the sediment and the flux of dissolved trace metal release. UK climate change models predict longer dry periods for some regions, interspersed with higher magnitude flood events. If we are to fully comprehend the future environmental risk these climate change events pose to mining impacted river systems it is recommended that research efforts focus on identifying the primary controls on trace metal release at the oxic-anoxic interface for flood and drought cycles of different duration and frequency. This paper critically reviews the literature regarding biogeochemical processes that occur at different temporal scales during oxic, reducing and dry periods and focuses on how iron and sulphur based minerals may alter in form and reactivity and influence the mobility of trace metal contaminants. It is clear that changes in redox potential can alter the composition of secondary iron and <b>sulphur</b> <b>minerals</b> and influence the sorption of toxic trace metals and susceptibility to dissolution when further redox potential changes occur. However further work is needed to determine: (i) The extent to which different duration and frequency of wet and dry cycles influences the dissolution and precipitation of iron and <b>sulphur</b> <b>minerals</b> in mining contaminated river bank sediment; (ii) The temporal effects on mineral reactivity (sorption capacity and susceptibility to dissolution); (iii) The key biogeochemical processes that control the mobility of contaminant trace metals under these dynamic redox potential conditions...|$|E

Abstract: The pear leaf blister mite can cause severe damage to pear leaves and young fruits in some regions. Due to hidden living inside leaf blisters, the mites are largely protected against the impact of plant protecting agents. Until now, treatments with mineral oil or rape oil in early spring, during the time when the mites leave their hibernation sites under the bud scales to invade the young leaves and blossoms, are the only possibility to control these mites in Swiss organic fruit growing. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of <b>sulphur,</b> <b>mineral</b> oil and Surround®WP applied after harvest during the time, when the mites leave their blisters and migrate to their hibernation sites. The different treatments were applied shortly after harvest to benefit from the mild temperatures in September.

But the visual control in spring during bloom could not verify these results for all treatments. Only the sulphur-treated trees were virtually free of blisters in spring.

30|$|Acid mine {{drainage}} (AMD), {{not only}} {{most common in}} coal and metal mining, but also in highway construction and other large-scale excavations, results from exposure of sulphide minerals to oxidizing conditions. The oxidized <b>sulphur</b> <b>minerals</b> form acidic sulphate-rich drainage. The type and quantity of sulphide minerals present determines the metal composition and concentration in AMD. Generally, sulphide-rich and carbonate-poor materials produce acidic drainage. Iron sulphides are most common but other metal sulphides may also produce AMD {{in the presence of}} water and oxygen. Metal contamination associated with AMD depends on the type and amount of sulphide mineral oxidized, as well as the type of gangue minerals present in the rock. About 90  % of the AMD reaching streams originate in abandoned surface and deep mines (Skousen et al. 2000). The acidic sulphur-rich wastewaters may also arise from the by-products of a variety of industrial operations such as galvanic processing and the scrubbing of flue gases at power plants (Johnson 2000).|$|E
40|$|To further our {{understanding}} of the ecological role of sulphur-oxidizing microorganisms in the generation of acid mine drainage (AMD), growth and attachment of the chemoautotrophic sulphur-oxidizing bacterium, Thiobacillus caldus, on the sulphide minerals pyrite, marcasite and arsenopyrite was studied. Growth curves were estimated based on total cells detected in the system (in suspension and attached to mineral surfaces). In general, higher cell numbers were detected on surfaces than in suspension. Fluorescent in situ hybridizations to cells on surfaces at mid-log growth confirmed that cells on surfaces were metabolically active. Total cell (both surface and solution phase) generation times on pyrite and marcasite (both FeS 2) were calculated to be approximate to 7 and 6 h respectively. When grown on pyrite (not marcasite), the number of T. caldus cells in the solution phase decreased, while the total number of cells (both surface and solution) increased. Additionally, marcasite supported about three times more total cells (approximate to 3 x 10 (9)) than pyrite (approximate to 8 x 10 (8)). This may be attributed to the dissolution rate of marcasite, which is twice that of pyrite. Epifluorescent and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to analyse the cell orientation on surfaces. Results of Fourier transform analysis of fluorescent images confirmed that attachment to all three sulphides occurred in an oriented manner. Results from high-resolution SEM imaging showed that cell orientation coincides with dissolution pit edges and secondary <b>sulphur</b> <b>minerals</b> that develop during dissolution. Preferential colonization of surfaces relative to solution and oriented cell attachment on these sulphide surfaces suggest that T. caldus may chemotactically select the optimal site for chemoautotrophic growth on sulphur (i. e. the mineral surface) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAcid mine {{drainage}} is {{a widespread}} environmental problem in Lusatia {{in the eastern part}} of Germany, where extensive brown coal and lignite mining was carried out during the last century. As a result of oxidation of pyrite in strip mine dumps of this region, numerous mine drainage lakes have pH values < 3 and are characterized by high concentrations of dissolved sulphate and ferrous iron. Using chemical and isotopic techniques, we tested in laboratory bottle experiments the extent to which the addition of degradable organic carbon to acid lake water and sediments could stimulate bacterial (dissimilatory) sulphate reduction. The overall goal was to evaluate whether bacterial sulphate reduction, and subsequent formation of sedimentary sulphide minerals, could generate enough alkalinity to potentially neutralize the acid lakes in Lusatia. Pyruvate, glucose, succinic acid, lactate, ethanol, acetate, and various industrial by-products were added in various concentrations to original lake water and sediments in glass bottles and incubated between 4 and 12 weeks in darkness. The extent of bacterial sulphate reduction was determined by analyzing the concentrations and the isotopic compositions of sulphate in the water column, and the contents and δ 34 S values of various sedimentary sulphur compounds at the beginning and the end of the experiments. Bacterial sulphate reduction was significantly enhanced after addition of pure substances (lactate, pyruvate, acetate, and ethanol) resulting in elevated pH values (4. 5 to 6. 0) in the bottle water at the end of the experiments. Cheap industrial by-products (whey, molasses, Pfezi-granules, and Carbokalk) as organic carbon source were also shown to be effective in enhancing bacterial sulphate reduction, thereby increasing the pH value of the bottle water. In general, the addition of selected organic carbon compounds enhanced sufficiently bacterial sulphate reduction and the formation of sedimentary <b>sulphur</b> <b>minerals,</b> generating enough alkalinity for raising the pH of the bottle water to near-neutral values. Further research in enclosures and under field conditions is needed to determine whether this technique constitutes a feasible remediation strategy for the acid lakes in Lusatia...|$|E

40|$|Invited keynote lectureThe {{geochemistry}} of selenium, exhibiting valence {{states from}} +VI to –II, is of key importance {{due to its}} role as a highly toxic essential micronutrient and as a significant component of high level radioactive waste (HLRW). XAS studies conducted at circum-neutral pH have shown that pyrite (FeS 2), the most relevant redox-active mineral in Boom clay, reduces selenite to a solid-state Se(0) phase. This observation raises several questions. First, why does an Fe-free Se(0) phase form in presence of pyrite, while selenite is reduced to FeSex by troilite and mackinawite (FeS) ?[1 - 4]. What is the exact identity of this Se(0) phase, which has been observed by several authors? Why is a dissolved, low oxidation-state selenium species encountered in association with the Se(0) phase; and what is its identity? Correlating selenium redox chemistry with sulphide mineral oxidation pathways allowed to link these observations to the different oxidation behaviour of acid-soluble and acid-insoluble metal sulphides [5]. Acid insoluble metal sulphides such as pyrite, molybdenite or tungstenite exhibit oxidative dissolution only. Upon six consequent one-electron oxidation steps, a thiosulphate anion is liberated (thiosulphate pathway). In contrast, acid soluble metal sulphides (troilite, mackinawite, sphalerite, etc.) exhibit also non-oxidative dissolution thereby liberating sulphide species (H 2 oxidative dissolution in presence of FeIII cations (e. g. H 2 S+ S, HS- disulphide species, which may further to,S 2 -). Under). The latter can spontaneously dimerize react (polysulphide pathway) and finally elemental sulphur.

The solid phase reaction product could not yet be assigned as a specific phase, but clearly identified as a Se 0 compound. Trigonal (grey) selenium could be excluded as a canditate. [4] The presence of an unexpected high concentration of reduced, dissolved species in presence of pyrite, led to a new pyrite-centered reduction mechanism. Based on this mechanism, a hypothesis about the identity of the unknown dissolved species was put forward. In addition, the new mechanism explains all current experimental observations, especially the presence of the currently non-identified dissolved species and the unexpected relation between Se(IV) reduction and pH.

40|$|Za izračunavanje emisije ugljikova dioksida zbog izgaranja ugljena, emisijski faktor CO 2 važan je ulazni parametar. Referentni emisijski faktori prema Uputama Međuvladinog tijela za klimatske promjene iz 2006. godine (engl. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) specificirani su prema stupnju pougljenja (coal rank), ali se pri izradi nacionalnog izvješća o stakleničkim plinovima preporučuje primjena nacionalnih emisijskih faktora. Sadržaj ugljika najvažnije je svojstvo ugljena i pokazatelj je stupnja pougljenja (karbonizacije). Međutim mnoga svojstva ugljena vrlo su specifična (npr. sadržaj sumpora, pepela, vlage i macerala) te emisijski faktori CO 2 ugljena ne ovise samo o stupnju pougljenja već i o njegovu geografskom porijeklu. U preliminarnom istraživanju, temeljem podataka dobivenih analizom goriva, izračunati su emisijski faktori CO 2 za ugljene i treset s područja Livna, BiH: 147, 9 t TJ− 1 za treset, 109, 5 t TJ− 1 za lignit i 98, 7 t TJ− 1 za smeđi ugljen, što odgovara sljedećim donjim ogrjevnim vrijednostima (Hd) : 3, 6 MJ kg− 1, 11, 5 MJ kg− 1 i 20, 6 MJ kg− 1. Razlika u ogrjevnoj vrijednosti može se djelomično objasniti različitim udjelom ukupne vlage u ispitivanim uzorcima. Usporedba izračunatih emisijskih faktora s referentnim vrijednostima, pokazala je najveća odstupanja kod treseta (39, 5 %), potom kod lignita (8, 2 %) i smeđeg ugljena (4, 3 %). Emission {{factors are}} used in {{greenhouse}} gas inventories to estimate emissions from coal combustion. In the absence of direct measures, emissions factors are frequently used as a quick, low cost way to estimate emissions values. Coal combustion {{has been a major}} contributor to the CO 2 flux into the atmosphere. Nearly all of the fuel carbon (99 %) in coal is converted to CO 2 during the combustion process. The carbon content is the most important coal parameter which is the measure of the degree of coalification (coal rank). Coalification is the alteration of vegetation to form peat, succeeded by the transformation of peat through lignite, sub-bituminous, bituminous to anthracite coal. During the geochemical or metamorphic stage, the progressive changes that occur within the coal are an increase in the carbon content and a decrease in the hydrogen and oxygen content resulting in a loss of volatiles. Heterogeneous composition of coal causes variation in CO 2 emission from different coals. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has produced guidelines on how to produce emission inventories which includes emission factors. Although 2006 IPCC Guidelines provided the default values specified according to the rank of the coal, the application of country-specific emission factors was recommended when estimating the national greenhouse gas emissions. This paper discusses the differences between country-specific emission factors and default IPCC CO 2 emission factors, EF(CO 2), for coals. Also, this study estimated EF(CO 2) for two different types of coals and peat from B&H, on the basis fuel analyses. Carbon emission factors for coal mainly depend on the carbon content of the fuel and vary with both rank and geographic origin, which supports the idea of provincial variation of carbon emission factors. Also, various other factors, such as content of <b>sulphur,</b> <b>minerals</b> and macerals play an important role and influence EF(CO 2) from coal. Carbonate minerals (calcite and siderite) directly contribute CO 2 when they decompose during coal combustion. Variations in the maceral content can also influence CO 2 emissions; high inertinite contents increase CO 2 emissions. Sulphur in coal reduces EF(CO 2). Fuel analysis is very important when estimating greenhouse gas emissions and emission factors. In this preliminary study, {{based on the results of}} the fuel analysis, CO 2 emission factors for coals and peat from Livno, B&H have been calculated. EF(CO 2) is defined as the amount of carbon dioxide emission per unit net calorific values of the fuel. Net calorific value (the lower heating value) corresponds to the heat produced by combustion where total water in the combustion products exists as water vapour. The EF(CO 2) obtained for sub-bituminous coal, lignite and peat were: 98. 7, 109. 5, and 147. 9 t TJ− 1, respectively, which correspond to the following net calorific values: 20. 6, 11. 5 and 3. 6 MJ kg− 1. The heating value is generally known to increase with the increase in carbon content (this parameter is connected with the degree of coalification, coal age). The other indispensable parameters are hydrogen, which has a positive effect on the net calorific value, and oxygen and water which impact the net calorific value negatively. The differences in net calorific values can be explained in part by the difference of total moisture content among the different fuel types. The CO 2 emission factors calculated in this study were compared with those of IPCC. A significant difference was observed for peat (39. 5 %), followed by lignite (8. 2 %) and sub-bituminous coal (4. 3 %) ...|$|E

The trial was carried out in 2014 at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Environment of the University of Foggia (southern Italy), using processing tomato plants grown in pots filled with soil from a field that was heavily infested with P. ramosa. After transplantation, top dressing was performed with 70 kg ha – 1 nitrogen. A randomised block design with 3 replicates (pots) was adopted. During the growing cycle of the tomato, at 70, 75, 81 and 88 days after transplantation, the number of parasitic shoots (branched plants) that had emerged in each pot was determined, and the leaf chlorophyll of the plants was measured using a soil-plantanalysis- development meter. At harvesting on 8 August 2014, the major quanti-qualitative yield parameters were determined, including marketable yield, mean weight, dry matter, soluble solids, and fruit colour.

The main organic sulphur compounds registered by the off-line AP-TPR-GC-MS were highly volatile compounds (thiols, sulphides, disulphides), alkylated thiophenes, and a lesser proportion of benzothiophenes. The disulphides (-SS-) are relatively abundant in the Maritza East and Elhovo lignites. They are probably the main aliphatic sulphur species in the coal's organic matter. Aliphatic chains with sulphur bridges are also principal structural functionalities in the Maritza West organic matter. Aromatic compounds with two aromatic rings and high degrees of substitution could be key organic structures in the studied lignites...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{trial on}} citrus nursery management by organic means {{has been conducted}} {{with the aim of}} seed treatment for conservation, soil fertility management and spider mite control. The seed treatment was performed by a combination of thermotherapy and different allowed fungicides (Copper, Equisetum, and Bordeaux mixture). The fifty percent copper solution protected the seeds for at least two months. The soil fertility management considered the rootstocks production (Citrange troyer, Sour orange, Rough lemon and Trifoliate orange) and took into account the major ingredients, macronutrients and micronutrinets. In the major ingredients, the soil was found to be essential and the combination of the peat moss sand and soil with equal quantities gave a suitable mixture. When the macronutrients were studied, a poultry manure-based fertilizer gave the best growth when applied at different rates, depending on the rootstock type. Also the micronutrients performed the best when incorporated in the mixture. The phytosanitary management study tested three approved products to control spider mites (pyrethrins, <b>sulphur</b> and <b>mineral</b> oils). The three treatments were found to be efficient in the control of the mites and showed specificity toward the controlled specie...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Accurate {{mapping of}} the mineral {{deposits}} buried by tens {{to hundreds of}} meters of overburden will focus an exploration program, minimizing costs and time expended. Traditional surface geochemical techniques often focus on measuring and mapping metal ions in the soil or vegetation, water/soil chemical properties, and by-product gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. A new technique, Amplified Geochemical ImagingSM Technology, focuses on high sensitivity measurements of volatile compounds emanating from the mineral itself, its contact zone, or associated redox systems. Compounds ranging from light sulphur species to organics with 18 carbon atoms, which reach the surface more easily than the metal ions associated with the mineral deposit, are collected and analyzed using a sensitive and sophisticated analytical technique. Differentiation of compounds associated with the mineralization and a robust image of the buried deposit are then obtained by processing the data using advanced modelling systems and multivariate statistical methods. This new technique works well with high <b>sulphur</b> containing <b>minerals</b> such as VMS, porphyry copper, Mississippi Valley-type deposits, and some gold systems. In this paper, Amplified Geochemical ImagingSM Technology, along with conventional surface geochemical {{analysis was used to}} image...|$|R

The water of the Hévíz Lake is equally rich in dissolved substances and gases, combining the favourable effects of naturally carbonated medicinal waters and those containing sulphur, calcium, magnesium, hydrogen-carbonate, as well as those with a slightly radioactive content. The medicinal Hévíz mud, which is unique of its kind, contains both organic and inorganic substances and the radium-salts and reduced sulphuric solutions in it represent special medicinal factors. The temperature of the water is 23-25 °C in winter and 33-36 °C in summer.|$|R

40|$|The {{examination}} of fine-grained concretions {{such as the}} uranium and vanadium enriched mudstones of Budleigh Salterton, Devon presents difficulties because of the sub-micron size of their mineral grains. We have attempted {{to address this problem}} by collecting X-ray images of thin sections of these concretions using a Jeol 8600 electron microprobe. Techniques were developed in this study using "Image 1. 54 " and "Photoshop 3. 0 " to process individual element maps and produce a composite image in which the degree of opacity of each layer can be varied. This allows rapid determination of the distribution of elements and their associations. The technique does not identify minerals as such, but gives an insight into element relationships from which mineral compositions can be deduced. The concretions, which are of Upper Permian age, were collected from the cliffs of Budleigh Salterton in Devon. They contain moderately high concentrations of uranium, vanadium and copper. They are also cobalt, nickel, lead and arsenic enriched. For example, cobalt occurs in the concretions as an arsenide <b>mineral,</b> a <b>sulphur</b> arsenic <b>mineral,</b> a sulphide and a cobalt nickel sulphide. The observed mineralization occurs as metal-rich coatings around quartz and other primary grains and as a replacement in areas where calcite has dissolved. Examples of other metal sulphides and other associated mineralization are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the process of {{bacterial}} sulphate reduction, which is used to removal of heavy metals and sulphate ions from waste waters. The life of animals and plants depends on the existence of microscopic organisms  microorganisms (MO), which {{play an important role in}} cycle changes of biogenic elements on the earth. The sulphur cycle in the nature is considered as one of the oldest and most significant biological systems (Fig. 1). The sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) miss the assimilatory part of the cycle and produce sulphides. The microbial population of this dissimilatory part is called sulfuretum. The SRB can be found in anaerobic mud and sediments of freshwater, thermal or non-thermal sulphur springs, mining waters from sulphide deposits, oil deposits, sea and ocean beds, and in the gastrointestinal tract of man and animals. The SRB represent a group of chemoorganotrophic, strictly anaerobic and gramnegative bacteria, which exhibit a great morphological and physiological diversity. Despite of their considerable morphological variety, they have one property in common, which is the ability to utilise preferentially sulphates (occasionally sulphites, thiosulphates, tetrathionates) as electron acceptors, which are reduced to sulphides, during anaerobic respiration. The electron donors in these processes are simple organic compounds as lactate, malate, etc.,(heterotrophically reduction) or gaseous hydrogen (autotrophically reduction). SRB can produce a considerable amount of hydrogen sulphide, which reacts easily in aqueous solution with the cations of heavy metals, forming metal sulphides that have low solubility. The bacterial sulphate reduction can be used for the treatment of acid mine drainage waters, which is considered to be the major problem associated with mining activities. In order to remove heavy metals from waste waters, e. g., from galvanizing plants, mine waters (Smolnik, obov locality) and metallurgic plants (works Krompachy) by use of the activity of SRB, mixed strains were isolated, cultivated, and their production of hydrogen sulphide was assessed. The cultures were then tested for the ability to precipitate copper and sulphates from a model solution. The bacteria were isolated from water samples from two localities: Východoslovenské eleziarne (works)  VS and spring Gajdovka  Gj. Isolation, cultivation and eliminating Cu 2 + and SO 42 - was carried out under following conditions: statically, temperature 30 oC, pH 7, 5, nutrient medium by J. Postgate (medium B, C and D) and anaerobic conditions. Residual copper in the solution was measured by atomic absorption photometry. The concentracion of sulphates in the solution was measured by the nefelometric method. Our findings from the isolation of SRB from two Slovak water samples and testing the cultures for their ability to remove copper permit the following conclusions: SRB occur in sufficient numbers in <b>sulphur</b> <b>mineral</b> water from natural sources and in industrial waste waters reservoirs, the sulphate-reducing activity can be harnessed for the purification of some industrial waste waters. The nature possesses a great biological potential that can be exploited under certain conditions in the cleanup of environmental pollution resulting from the industrial activity in the past and present...|$|R

40|$|The physico-chemical {{principles}} of chloride hydrometallurgy are reviewed to rationalise the complex chemistry in chloride-based processes for metal sulphides {{in terms of}} the predicted Eh-log[Cl-] relationships, measured changes in activity of H+, Mz+, Cl- and solubility of Ag(I), Cu(I), Cu(II), Pb(II), Ni(II), Au(III), Sb(III) and Bi(III). These changes reflect the nature of chemical speciation, competing effect of hydration/hydrolysis and chloro-complexation, composite effect of increasing acid and/or salt concentration and decreasing water activity. Rate data for the dissolution of PbS and ZnS in HCl containing Fe(III) or Cu(II) are compared and contrasted to highlight the effect of acid and chloride concentration, water activity, and the nature of oxidant. It is shown that LiCl, NaCl and HCl influence the kinetics of oxidative PbS leaching based on their effect on solubility of PbCl 2 co-precipitated with elemental <b>sulphur</b> on the <b>mineral</b> surface.

30|$|The lustrous golden {{tone of the}} {{orpiment}} {{was used}} to colour the cloth and nimbus of Jesus and the decorative motives including the cross on the cloth of Mary. It {{appears to have been}} used here as an imitation of gold. Orpiment was called ‘The Kings’s Gold’ for its brilliance and resemblance to gold. The use of orpiment as a pigment extends over a very long period of time that could reach {{as far back as the}} seven century BC in Mesopotamia, where its source was also identified [10]. It was widely used in Asia for long period and in the Middle Ages orpiment was exported to Europe from Asia Minor [23]. Though it is possible that this pigment was originally from the Middle East, it could also have been obtained from the Dallol Depression (also called Danakil Depression) in Afar, northeast Ethiopia. Here, where volcanic and hydrothermal activities occur, the formation of <b>sulphur</b> and sulphide <b>minerals</b> are possible including sulphides of arsenic [24]. The search for the source of the orpiment used in this painting would thus benefit from further investigation.|$|R
