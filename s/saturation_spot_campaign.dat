40|$|Rapid {{assessment}} of landslide activity {{is important in}} case of adverse climatic conditions leading to civil protection’s alerts that require increased surveillance of risk areas. GB-InSAR is nowadays becoming a consolidated near-sensing monitoring technique for slope movements. It can be installed rapidly and it can rapidly provide results {{in the form of}} displacement maps. However, it has never been thoroughly tested in radar-hostile conditions such as these posed by large-scale earth slides – earth flows covered by a canopy of trees bushes and meadows, that are the typical landslides in Emilia Romagna Apennine. As sparse small villages, buildings, roads and other lifelines are often built on these landslide bodies, they are of particular concern for civil protection, especially during prolonged rainfall periods that determine attention/alerting conditions. To test the possibility to achieve improved surveillance capability in case of attention needed, a series of GB-InSAR <b>spot</b> <b>campaigns</b> lasting from a week to a month, was carried out in 2010 - 11 in several landslides of Emilia Romagna Apennine using a commercial interferometric radar.

2500|$|The <b>saturation</b> of binding <b>spots</b> on thyronine-binding {{globulin}} (TBG) by endogenous T3 can {{be estimated}} by the triiodothyronine resin uptake test.

A fraction of the radioactive T3 binds to sites on TBG not already occupied by endogenous thyroid hormone, and the remainder binds to the resin. The amount of labeled hormones bound to the resin is then subtracted from the total that was added, with the remainder thus being the amount that was bound to the unoccupied binding sites on [...] TBG.|$|R
