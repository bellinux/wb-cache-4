Together, they encompass a unique transition zone between the mountain ranges of the Zanskar and Great Himalaya. The park stretches over an expanse of 87.50 km2 and it is about 8 km long and 2 km wide. Both parks are encompassed in the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (223,674 ha) which is further surrounded by a buffer zone (5,148.57 km2).

40|$|Himalayan Monal and Koklass were {{observed}} from three selected sites (Batandar, Anakar and Janshai) in winter about 7900 ft and 7500 ft and in summer 12381 ft and 10108 ft {{from the sea}} level respectively. The altitudinal migration of Himalayan Monal and Koklass from lower to upper elevated zones {{was the result of}} human activities and livestock grazing in summer season while their downward migration was the result of heavy snowfall in their natural habitats. The first nidification record was also observed in kalam valley during the study sites where three nests were detected one of <b>Monal</b> <b>pheasant</b> and two of Koklass pheasant. The Koklass nests were present on the ground at batandar (8620 ft), and Janshai (9305 ft) while the only nest of Himalayan Monal was observed in Janshai (9447 ft). The nesting behavior of Koklass was professionally like other birds but on the ground while the Monal nest was just like a temporary scrapes on the ground. Concluding from the study work that nests of these pheasants are mostly affected from local residents in early summer and foraging mostly from livestock. Awareness and education to the local villagers will help in conservation of habitats. The strict action of wildlife staff against poachers and illegal hunters will also be helpful for the conservation of these pheasants...|$|R
50|$|The Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus), {{also known}} as the Impeyan <b>monal,</b> Impeyan <b>{{pheasant}},</b> is a bird in the pheasant family, Phasianidae. It is the national bird of Nepal, where it is known as the danphe, and state bird of Uttarakhand India, where it is known as the monal. It was also the state bird of Himachal Pradesh until 2007.Traditionally, the Himalayan monal has been classified as monophyletic. However, {{studies have shown that the}} male Himalayan monal of northwestern India lacks the white rump of other Himalayan monals, and it has more green on the breast, indicating the possibility of a second subspecies.|$|R
5|$|The {{avifauna}} {{consists of}} various types of laughing thrushes, which live in shrubs and on the forest floor. The blue whistling-thrush, redstarts, and forktails are found near waterfalls and hill-streams. The mixed hunting species present in the region include warblers, tit-babblers, treecreepers, white-eyes, wrens, and rose finches. Raptors such as black eagle, black-winged kite and kestrels; and <b>pheasants</b> such as <b>monals</b> and blood <b>pheasant</b> are also found.|$|R
50|$|The {{density of}} wild {{animals in the}} valley is not high, but all the animals found are rare or endangered. A total 13 species of mammals are {{recorded}} for the park by CP Kala and its vicinity although only he sighted 9 species directly: {{northern plains grey langur}} Semnopithecus entellus, flying squirrel Petaurista petaurista, Himalayan black bear Ursus thibetanus (VU), red fox Vulpes vulpes, Himalayan weasel Mustela sibirica, and Himalayan yellow-throated marten Martes flavigula, Himalayan goral Naemorhedus goral, Himalayan musk deer Moschus leucogaster, Indian chevrotain Moschiola indica, Himalayan thar Hemitragus jemlahicus (VU) and serow Capricornis sumatraensis (VU). The tahr is common, the serow, goral, musk deer and bharal, blue sheep are rare. The common leopard Panthera pardus is reported from lower parts of the valley closer to the villages. Local people have also reported evidence of brown bear Ursus arctos and bharal or blue sheep Pseudois nayaur. A recent faunal survey in October 2004 has established the presence of snow leopard Panthera uncia (EN) in the national park. The area is within the West Himalayan Endemic Bird Area but there have been no surveys specific to the Valley. 114 species were seen in 1993 in Nanda Devi Park. Species frequently seen in the valley include lammergeier Gypaetus barbatus, Himalayan vulture Gyps himalayensis, yellow billed and red billed choughs Pyrrhocorax graculus and P. pyrrhocorax, koklass pheasant Pucrasia macrolopha, the nationally listed Himalayan <b>monal</b> <b>pheasant</b> Lophophorus impejanus, found in rhododendron thickets, scaly-bellied and yellow-nape woodpeckers Picus squamatus and P. flavinucha, great and bluethroated barbets Megalaima virens and M. asiatica, snow pigeon Columba leuconota and spotted dove Stigmatopelia chinensis. The area is relatively poor in reptiles: most often seen are the high altitude lizard Agama tuberculata, Himalayan ground skink Leiolopisma himalayana and Himalayan pit viper Gloydius himalayanus. Along with the flowers are wild bees and many species of butterfly which need to be more researched. A few of the more evident species are lime butterfly Papilio demoleus demoleus, common yellow swallowtail Papilio machaon, common Mormon Papilio polytes romulus, spangle Papilio protenor protenor and common blue apollo Parnassius hardwickei.|$|R
50|$|The zoo {{includes}} an off-display breeding center for snow leopards and red pandas. Captive breeding of snow leopards {{was started in}} 1983, with leopards which {{were brought to the}} zoo from Zurich, the United States, and Leh-Ladakh. The red panda program was started in 1994 with individuals from the Cologne Zoo, the Madrid Zoo, Belgium, and the Rotterdam Zoo. In addition to these species, the zoo is breeding the Himalayan tahr, blue sheep, Himalayan <b>monal,</b> grey peacock <b>pheasant,</b> Himalayan salamander, blood pheasant and satyr tragopan. The zoo is famous for its conservation breeding programmes of the red panda, Himalayan salamander, Tibetan wolf, and snow leopard.|$|R
40|$|The species Sporophila bouvreuil {{comprises}} four subspecies: S. b. bouvreuil, S. b. pileata, S. b. saturata and S. b. crypta. The {{males of}} each subspecies differ in plumage whereas the females and juveniles {{are very similar}} and difficult to identify to subspecies. Here we use external morphological characters, mostly plumage, to examine {{the validity of the}} subspecies. A total of 209 specimens was examined (131 S. b. bouvreuil, 29 S. b. crypta, 43 S. b. pileata and 6 S. b. saturata). Although morphological measurements did not separate any taxa, plumage patterns support recognition of two taxonomic units, one of birds having reddish brown male plumage and the other of birds with grayish to white male plumage. Discrete diagnostic characters and sympatry in SE Brazil allow separation of Sporophila pileata (<b>Sclater</b> 1864) from <b>S.</b> bouvreuil (Muller 1776). On the other hand, S. b. saturata Hellmayr 1904 and S. b. crypta Sick 1968 should be considered synonyms of S. bouvreuil.
