This invariably brought them into conflict with the Cherokee, who had lived and hunted in the land for centuries. Random murders and <b>scalpings</b> became commonplace, and the settlers formed independent militias to carry out reprisal attacks. This violence reached a climax in 1793, when the Cherokee attacked Henry's Station in Blount County, and the settlers responded by crossing Chilhowee Mountain and sacking the Cherokee village of Tallassee. Even as the Cherokee chief Hanging Maw was meeting with Governor William Blount to discuss bringing peace to the area, the chief's delegation was attacked by a band of settlers, killing several Cherokee headmen.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT THE CROW CREEK MASSACRE: THE ROLE OF SEX IN NATIVE AMERICAN <b>SCALPING</b> PRACTICES by Ashley Kendell Master of Arts in Anthropology California State University, Chico Spring 2011 Archaeological {{evidence}} of warfare on the Great Plains precedes the initial date of European contact by several hundred years. Evidence of warfare in {{the archaeological record}} includes skeletal indications of violent injury, mass graves, fortification structures, and village abandonment. Among these indicators of warfare, scalping is a reliable and easily recognizable expression of intergroup conflict. Scalping is represented by a characteristic pattern of cut marks in the archaeological record, and is therefore an accurate skeletal indicator of violence. Previous research reports {{that there is not}} a significant relationship between a victim???s age and sex and whether or not they became a scalping victim. The primary objective of this study is to present a thorough assessment of different treatment between the sexes, as well as different treatment among adult age groups at the Crow Creek Site. A secondary goal of this study is to determine whether or not a significant relationship exists between sex, age and burial placement in the human bone bed at the Crow Creek Site. Finally, this study attempts to present a preliminary assessment of the role of gender in Native American scalping practices. This skeletal sample is composed of massacre victims recovered from the human bone bed at the Crow Creek Site in Buffalo County, South Dakota. All skeletal material used in this study originates from the Initial Coalescent Component occupation that terminated at the time of the massacre, roughly 1325 A. D. Skeletal material from the Crow Creek Site was repatriated in May 1979. Because skeletal material was previously repatriated, all data used in this study are drawn from the age and sex assessments recorded by Mark Swegle in 1979 and the scalping mutilation data collected by an anonymous investigator at the University of South Dakota that same year. In total, a sample of 77 aged and sexed crania is used in this study. The major findings can be summarized. Statistically significant relationships exist between the total number of cuts on male and female crania, and age and breadth of the frontal cuts. Factorial ANOVA results indicate the interaction between age and sex by frontal cut breadth is significant, and from this test result we conclude that sex differences in the breadth of cuts on the frontal are affected by the age of the victim. Regression and correlation are performed on the frontal cut breadths to clarify the relationship between sex and age. There is a moderate negative relationship between frontal cut breadth and age in males, and a non-significant relationship between frontal cut breadth and age in females. Finally, there is not a significant relationship between the location of the victim in the bone bed and the victim???s age and sex, suggesting that individuals were placed in the fortification ditch at random. Explanations for the disparity in the number of cut marks observed on male and female victims of the Crow Creek massacre include the following: female scalping victims experience higher levels of brutality than males, more cuts are observed on female victims because their attackers are not hurried because of a fear of retaliation, female scalps are more valued than male scalps and therefore more time is spent removing a larger piece of scalp from female victims, and finally, differences in hairstyle cause differences in the size of the scalp removed. Of the four explanations presented for the disparity in total cuts observed on males and females, the first explanation, that female victims of the Crow Creek massacres suffer higher levels of brutality, is the most plausible. The results of the regression and correlation analyses indicate that variability in frontal cut breadths is explained by age only in male victims. The most plausible explanation for this result is that warfare was predominantly a male activity. Because warriors are typically young males, a distinction is made between male age groups because warrior scalps are considered more valuable. Because the scalp is used as an indication of bravery and prowess in battle, it is likely that a higher value is placed on the scalp of a young and virile male, than the scalp of an older male victim. The chi-square goodness of fit test indicates that there is no difference in the burial location of Crow Creek massacre victims by sex or age. The results suggest that all Crow Creek victims are treated similarly regarding burial location. If victims experience similar treatment after death, there would not be any observable relationship between an individual???s age and sex and that individual???s placement in the bone bed.

The twist, and what helps elevate the nasty, no-holds-barred Maniac from the grindhouse to an out-of-competition midnight-screening slot in Cannes, is that the entire movie is shot from the killer's POV - we only glimpse Wood in reflection and in photographs. It's a daring decision, potentially stripping the film of the suspense of not knowing where the killer is and obliquely inviting the audience to have empathy with him. For the most part Khalfoun and cinematographer Maxime Alexandre pull it off, although the technique more than once tips over from inventively arty to film-school-grad pretentious. Slasher-movie fans, however, need not be {{put off by the}} stylized camera work and arty patina: this is down and dirty genre filmmaking, and the various slaughters, excruciatingly detailed <b>scalpings</b> and other atrocities are no less gruesome because of the highfalutin approach...
