25|$|Synthesis of {{thalidomide}} has {{usually been}} performed {{as seen in}} <b>scheme</b> <b>1.</b> This synthesis is a reasonably simplistic three step process. The downside of this process however is that the last step requires a high-temperature melt reaction which demands multiple recrystallizations and is not compliant with standard equipment.|$|E
25|$|The {{ethyl ester}} of propionic acid (1) was {{brominated}} and then converted to the Wittig reagent using triphenylphosphine. Aldehyde 6 {{was obtained from}} allyl alcohol (4) by protection as the tert-butyldiphenylsilyl ether (5) followed by ozonolysis. Wittig reagent 3 and aldehyde 6 reacted in a Wittig reaction to give unsaturated ester 7, which was deprotected to give dienophile 8 (<b>Scheme</b> <b>1,</b> compound 1).|$|E

25|$|One {{of these}} {{advantages}} {{is that the}} compound is available as an air-stable yellow solid that is not very hygroscopic. Unlike other oxidizing agents, PCC can accomplish single oxidations with only about 1.5 equivalents (<b>scheme</b> <b>1).</b> The alcohol performs nucleophilic attack to the electropositive chromium (VI) metal displacing chlorine. The chloride anion then acts as a base to afford the aldehyde product and chromium (IV). The slightly acidic character of PCC makes it useful for cyclization reactions with alcohols and alkenes (Scheme 2).|$|E
25|$|The general {{principle}} is outlined in <b>scheme</b> <b>1.</b> An {{aromatic ring system}} with a DMG group 1 interacts with an alkyllithium such as n-butyllithium in its specific aggregation state (hence (R-Li)n) to intermediate 2 since the hetero atom on the DMG is a Lewis base and lithium the Lewis acid. The very basic alkyllithium then deprotonates the ring in the nearest ortho- position forming the aryllithium 3 all the while maintaining the acid-base interaction. An electrophile reacts in the next phase in an electrophilic aromatic substitution with a strong preference for the lithium ipso position replacing the lithium atom.|$|E
25|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} exist demonstrating how {{in certain}} autocatalytic reaction systems {{the presence of}} a small amount of reaction product with enantiomeric excess {{at the start of the}} reaction can result in a much larger enantiomeric excess at the end of the reaction. In the Soai reaction, pyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde (<b>Scheme</b> <b>1)</b> is alkylated by diisopropylzinc to the corresponding pyrimidyl alcohol. Because the initial reaction product is also an effective catalyst the reaction is autocatalytic. The presence of just 0.2 equivalent of the alcohol S-enantiomer at the start of the reaction is sufficient to amplify the enantiomeric excess to 93%.|$|E

3000|$|As {{shown in}} Table 1, the {{computational}} {{complexity of the}} proposed two schemes is {{much lower than the}} UFR scheme and the IPC scheme, with Scheme- 2 achieving the lowest complexity. Since the inter-cluster interference mitigation approaches (CFR- 1 and CFR- 2) are adopted in the first step of <b>Schemes</b> <b>1</b> and 2, only a subset of users is mapped to each subchannel. Hence, the number of feasible user sets for exhaustive search in the second step for <b>Schemes</b> <b>1</b> and 2 is significantly reduced.

2500|$|As {{shown in}} <b>Scheme</b> <b>1,</b> the ring {{synthesis}} of ring C {{began with a}} Diels-Alder reaction between diene 1.3 and dienophile 1.1 {{in the presence of}} [...] phenylboronic acid (1.2), which, after addition of 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol, gave five-membered lactone 1.8 in 62% yield. [...] Boron served as a molecular tether and aligned both diene and dienophile for this endo Diels-Alder cycloaddition. [...] After protection of the hydroxyl groups as tert-butyldimethylsilyl ethers, reduction of the ester with lithium aluminium hydride and selective deprotection of the secondary hydroxyl group gave lactone diol 1.11. [...] The unusual lactone hydrates 1.9 and 1.10 were isolated as synthetic intermediates in this process.|$|E
2500|$|The biosynthetic {{pathway to}} {{paclitaxel}} {{has been investigated}} and consists of approximately 20 enzymatic steps. The complete scheme is still unavailable. The segments that are known {{are very different from}} the synthetic pathways tried thus far (<b>Scheme</b> <b>1).</b> The starting compound is geranylgeranyl diphosphate 2 [...] which is a dimer of geraniol 1. [...] This compound already contains all the required 20 carbon atoms for the paclitaxel skeleton. More ring closing through intermediate 3 (taxadiene) leads to taxusin 4. The two main reasons why this type of synthesis is not feasible in the laboratory is that nature does a much better job controlling stereochemistry and a much better job activating a hydrocarbon skeleton with oxygen substituents for which cytochrome P450 is responsible in some of the oxygenations. Intermediate 5 is called 10-deacetylbaccatin III.|$|E
