5000|$|Some makes of air guns {{incorporate}} a gas spring (commonly {{referred to as}} a gas piston, gas ram, gas strut or nitro piston) instead of a mechanical coil spring. The spring itself is essentially a stand-alone enclosed piston pump without outlet and with pressurized air or inert gas (such as nitrogen) held tightly sealed within the cylinder. When the gun is cocked, the gas inside the cylinder gets further compressed by the piston, stores potential energy and acts in effect as a pneumatic accumulator. Gas spring units require higher precision to manufacture, since they require a low-friction <b>sliding</b> <b>seal</b> that can withstand the high pressures when cocked. The advantages of the gas spring include the ability to keep the gun cocked and ready to fire for extended periods of time without long-term spring fatigue, smoother recoil pattern and lower vibration, and faster [...] "lock time" [...] (the time between pulling the trigger and the pellet being discharged) which results in better accuracy. Gas spring air guns are also usually less [...] "hold-sensitive" [...] and hence easier to achieve consistent shot groupings.|$|E

40|$|A {{test program}} to {{determine}} the relative sliding durability of an alumina-silica candidate ceramic fiber for high temperature <b>sliding</b> <b>seal</b> applications as described. This work represents the first reporting of the sliding durability of this material system. Pin-on-disk tests were {{used to evaluate the}} potential seal material by sliding a tow or bundle of the candidate ceramic fiber against a superalloy test disk. Friction was measured during the tests and fiber wear, indicated by the extent of fibers broken in the tow or bundle, was measured {{at the end of each}} test. Test variables studied included ambient temperatures from 25 C to 900 C, loads from 1. 3 to 21. 2 Newtons, and sliding velocities from 0. 025 to 0. 25 m/sec. In addition, the effects of fiber diameter, elastic modulus, and a pretest fiber heat treatment on friction and wear were measured. In most cases, wear increased with temperature. Friction ranged from about 0. 36 at 500 C and low velocity (0. 025 m/s) to over 1. 1 at 900 C and high velocity (0. 25 m/s). The pretest fiber heat treatment, which caused significant durability reductions for alumina-boria-silica ceramic fibers tested previously, had little effect on the alumina-silica fibers tested here. These results indicate that the alumina-silica (Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2) fiber is a good candidate material system for high temperature <b>sliding</b> <b>seal</b> applications...|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} program is described which developes {{an understanding of}} high-temperature solid lubrication and experimental techniques {{through the development of}} a composite lubricant coating system. The knowledge gained through this research was then applied to a specific engineering challenge, the tribology of a <b>sliding</b> <b>seal</b> for hypersonic flight vehicles. The solid lubricant coating is a chromium carbide based composite combined with silver, which acts as a low temperature lubricant, and barium fluoride/calcium fluoride eutectic, which acts as a high-temperature lubricant. This composite coating provides good wear resistance and low friction for sliding contacts from room temperature to over 900 C in reducing or oxidative environments. The specific research on this coating included a composition screening using a foil gas bearing test rig and the use of thin silver films to reduce initial wear using a pin-on-disk test rig. The chemical stability of the materials used was also addressed. This research indicated that soft metallic films and materials which become soft at elevated temperatures are potentially good lubricants. The general results from the experiments with the model solid lubricant coating were then applied to a <b>sliding</b> <b>seal</b> design concept. This seal design requires that a braided ceramic fabric slide against a variety of metal counterface materials at temperatures from 25 to 850 C in an oxidative environment. A pin-on-disk tribometer was used to evaluate the tribological properties of these materials and to develop lubrication techniques. The results indicate that these seal materials must be lubricated to prevent wear and reduce friction. Thin films of silver, gold and calcium fluoride provided lubrication to the sliding materials...|$|E

Sliding was unidirectional at 0. 27 m/sec under a nominal contact stress of 340 kPa. Gold sputter or ion plating deposited films were used to reduce friction and wear. Rhodium and palladium films were used beneath the gold lubricating films to prevent diffusion of the substrate into the gold at high temperature. The friction and wear of the unlubricated specimens was unacceptable. Friction coefficients were generally greater than 1. 0. The ion plated gold films, when used with a rhodium diffusion barrier reduced friction by almost a factor of 2. Wear was also substantially reduced. The sputter deposited films were not adherent unless the substrate was sputter cleaned immediately prior to film deposition. Palladium did not function as a diffusion barrier...|$|E
40|$|A {{test program}} to {{determine}} the relative sliding durability of two candidate ceramic fibers for high temperature <b>sliding</b> <b>seal</b> applications is described. Pin on disk tests were used to evaluate potential seal materials. Friction during the tests and fiber wear, indicated by the extent of fibers broken in a test bundle or yarn, was measured {{at the end of}} a test. In general, friction and wear increase with test temperature. This may be due to a reduction in fiber strength, a change in the surface chemistry at the fiber/counterface interface due to oxidation, adsorption and/or desorption of surface species and, to a lesser extent, an increase in counterface surface roughness due to oxidation at elevated temperatures. The relative fiber durability correlates with tensile strength indicating that tensile data, which is more readily available than sliding durability data, may be useful in predicting fiber wear behavior under various conditions. A simple model developed using dimensional analysis shows that the fiber durability is related to a dimensionless parameter which represents the ratio of the fiber strength to the fiber stresses imposed by sliding...|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} design {{configurations}} for Stirling engines {{that can be}} built, many of which require rotary or <b>sliding</b> <b>seals,</b> which can introduce difficult tradeoffs between frictional losses and refrigerant leakage. A free-piston variant of the Stirling engine can be built, which can be completely hermetically sealed, reducing friction losses and completely eliminating refrigerant leakage. For example, a Free Piston Stirling Cooler (FPSC) can convert an electrical energy input into a practical heat pump effect, used for high-efficiency portable refrigerators and freezers. Conversely, a free-piston electrical generator could be built, converting a heat flow into mechanical energy, and then into electricity. In both cases, energy is usually converted from/to electrical energy using magnetic fields {{in a way that}} avoids compromising the hermetic seal.|$|R
50|$|Both {{hydraulic}} and {{pneumatic power}} {{may be used}} to drive an actuator, usually the larger and more powerful types. As their internal construction is generally similar (in principle, if not in size) they are often considered together as fluid power actuators. Fluid power actuators are of two common forms: those where a linear piston and cylinder mechanism is geared to produce rotation (illustrated), and those where a rotating asymmetrical vane swings through a cylinder of two different radii. The differential pressure between {{the two sides of the}} vane gives rise to an unbalanced force and thus a torque on the output shaft. Vane actuators require a number of <b>sliding</b> <b>seals</b> and the joints between these seals have tended to cause more problems with leakage than for the piston and cylinder type.|$|R
40|$|A {{test program}} to {{determine}} the friction and wear properties of two complex carbide oxide ceramic fibers for high temperature <b>sliding</b> <b>seal</b> applications is described. The fibers are based on Si, C, O, and Ti or Si, C, N, and O ceramic systems. Pin on disk tests using ceramic fiber covered pins and Inconel 718 disks, were conducted in air from 25 to 900 C to evaluate potential seal materials. This testing procedure was used in a previous study of oxide ceramic fibers which were found to exhibit wear behavior based predominantly on their mechanical properties. Like the oxide fibers tested previously, these carbide oxide ceramic fibers, show an increase in friction and wear with increased test temperature. At room temperature, the wear behavior seems to be based upon mechanical properties, namely tensile strength. At 500 and especially 900 C, the fibers wear by both mechanical fracture and by oxidative type wear. Based upon post test microscopic and x ray analyses, interaction between the fiber constituents and elements transferred from the counterface, namely Ni and Cr, may have occurred enhancing the tribochemical wear process. These results are interpreted...|$|E
40|$|Demanding {{tribological}} {{properties are}} required {{of the materials}} used for the <b>sliding</b> <b>seal</b> between the sidewalls and the lower wall of the variable area hypersonic engine. Temperatures range from room temperature and below to operating temperatures of 1000 C {{in an environment of}} air, hydrogen, and water vapor. Candidate sealing materials for this application are an alumina-boria-silicate, ceramic, fabric rope sliding against the engine walls which may be made from copper- or nickel-based alloys. Using a pin-on-disk tribometer, the friction and wear properties of some of these potential materials and possible lubrication methods are evaluated. The ceramic fabric rope displayed unacceptably high friction coefficients (0. 6 to 1. 3) and, thus, requires lubrication. Sputtered thin films of gold, silver, and CaF 2 reduced the friction by a factor of two. Sprayed coatings of boride nitride did not effectively lubricate the fabric. Static heat treatment tests at 950 C indicate that the fabric is chemically attacked by large quantities of silver, CaF 2, and boron nitride. Sputtered films or powder impregnation of the fabric with gold may provide adequate lubrication up to 1000 C without showing any chemical attack...|$|E
40|$|A liquid piston {{concept is}} {{proposed}} to improve the efficiency of gas compression and expansion. Because a liquid can conform to an irregular chamber volume, the surface {{area to volume ratio}} in the gas chamber can be maximized using a liquid piston. This creates near-isothermal operation, which minimizes energy lost to heat generation. A liquid piston eliminates gas leakage and replaces <b>sliding</b> <b>seal</b> friction with viscous friction. The liquid can also be used as a medium to carry heat {{into and out of the}} compression chamber. A simulation is presented of the heat transfer and frictional forces for a reciprocating piston and a liquid piston. In the application of an air compressor, with a pressure ratio of 9. 5 : 1 and a cycle frequency of 20 Â Hz, the liquid piston decreased the energy consumption by 19 % over the reciprocating piston. The liquid piston and the reciprocating piston exhibited a total efficiency of 83 % and 70 % respectively. The liquid piston demonstrated significant improvements in the total compression efficiency in comparison to a conventional reciprocating piston. This gain in efficiency was accomplished through increasing the heat transfer during the gas compression by increasing the surface area to volume ratio in the compression chamber.

Along with the cylinder wall and the displacer, there are a total of four regenerating surfaces. The TMG is a free piston engine.

The electron beam is a tool with high energy conversion efficiency, which is largely independent {{of the type of}} metal. Its high power density qualifies the non-vacuum electron beam as an outstanding energy source for the well-known NVEB welding as well as for high-speed cutting. Welding is possible with or without filler wire or shielding gas, depending on the application. The NVEB-cutting process employs a co-moving cutting head with a <b>sliding</b> <b>seal</b> for extremely high cutting speeds producing high quality edges. Due to direct removal of fumes and dust, NVEBC with local suction is an exceptionally clean and fast process. The NVEB welding process is possible directly after cutting, without further edge preparation. The potential directions of development of non-vacuum electron beam technologies are discussed.

40|$|The {{relative}} sliding durability {{behavior of}} six candidate ceramic fibers for high temperature <b>sliding</b> <b>seal</b> applications is reviewed and compared. Pin on disk tests {{were used to}} evaluate potential seal materials by sliding a tow or bundle of the candidate ceramic fiber against a superalloy test disk. Tests were conducted in air under a 2. 65 N load, at a sliding velocity of 0. 025 m/sec and at temperatures from 25 to 900 C. Friction was measured during the tests and fiber wear, indicated by the extent of fibers broken in the tow or bundle, was measured {{at the end of}} each test. For most of the fibers, friction and wear increase with test temperature. The relative fiber durability ranking correlates with tensile strength, indicating that tensile data, which is more readily available than sliding durability data, may be useful in predicting fiber wear behavior under various conditions. A dimensional analysis of the wear data shows that the fiber durability is related to a dimensionless durability ratio which represents the ratio of the fiber strength to the fiber stresses imposed by sliding. The analysis is applicable to fibers with similar diameters and elastic moduli. Based upon the results of the research program, three fiber candidates are recommended for further study as potential seal materials. They are a silicon based complex carbide-oxide fiber, an alumina-boria-silica and an aluminosilicate fiber...|$|E
40|$|A pig is a {{maintenance}} tool {{used in the}} Oil and Gas Industry, chiefly to remove solids or liquids from pipelines. It is in essence a <b>sliding</b> <b>seal,</b> which moves due to {{the action of the}} fluid pushing it. The aim of this work is to describe the steady state motion of the pipeline pig in terms of several key characteristics. An analytical model of the pig motion has bey prepared to calculate these parameters. The model also shows how these characteristics vary with velocity and distance due to wear. All assumptions and limitations are listed. The model has been verified by tests performed on a 10 " carbon steel pipeline. The model works by f rstly calculating the force exerted by the pig seal on the pipe wall. A generalisation of the seal shape allows calculation of the contact parameters. A simplified lubrication analysis ensues, enabling calculation of the seal film profile. Knowledge of film thickness allows estimation of friction, differential pressure and leakage rates. Varying pig velocity affects the film shape and thickness, which in turn affects seal friction and therefore alters the program output. Changes in pig characteristics due to abrasive wear are accounted for using a wear coefficient and estimating the volume of material removed over successive distance increments. The model compares well with the experimental remits for characteristics such as differential pressure and friction For this reason the wall force, contact and surface roughness models (i. e. the mechanical We of the problem) are considered to be accurate.
