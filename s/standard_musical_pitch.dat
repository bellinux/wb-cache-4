In order to distinguish between unimodal and multimodal spatial bases of <b>musical</b> <b>pitch,</b> we examined whether pitch activations were present in modality-specific (visual or tactile) versus multimodal (visual and tactile) regions active during spatial height processing.

25|$|The {{ability to}} {{recognize}} incorrect <b>pitch</b> (<b>musical)</b> is most often tested by using the Distorted Tunes Test (DTT). The DTT was originally developed in the 1940s and was used in large studies in the British population. The DTT measures <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> recognition ability on an ordinal scale, scored {{as the number of}} correctly classified tunes. More specifically the DTT is used to evaluate subjects on how well they judge whether simple popular melodies contain notes with incorrect pitch. Researchers have used this method to investigate genetic correlates of <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> recognition in both monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Drayna, Manichaikul, Lange, Snieder and Spector (2001) determined that the variation in <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> recognition is primarily due to highly heritable differences in auditory functions not tested by conventional audiologic methods. Therefore, the DTT method may provide a benefit to advancing research studies similar to this one.|$|R
40|$|Congenital amusia is {{a musical}} {{disorder}} that mainly affects pitch perception. Among Mandarin speakers, some amusics also have difficulties in processing lexical tones (tone agnosics). To examine {{to what extent}} these perceptual deficits {{may be related to}} pitch production impairments in music and Mandarin speech, 8 amusics, 8 tone agnosics, and 12 age- and IQ-matched normal native Mandarin speakers were asked to imitate music note sequences and Mandarin words of comparable lengths. The results indicated that both the amusics and tone agnosics underperformed the controls on <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> production. However, tone agnosics performed no worse than the amusics, suggesting that lexical tone perception deficits may not aggravate <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> production difficulties. Moreover, these three groups were all able to imitate lexical tones with perfect intelligibility. Taken together, the current study shows that perceptual <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> and lexical tone deficits might coexist with <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> production difficulties. But at the same time these perceptual pitch deficits might not affect lexical tone production or the intelligibility of the speech words that were produced. The perception-production relationship for pitch among individuals with perceptual pitch deficits may be, therefore, domain-dependent...|$|R

40|$|Williams {{syndrome}} (WS), {{a genetic}} neurodevelopmental disorder, {{has been taken}} as evidence that music and language constitute separate modules. This research focused on the linguistic component of prosody and aimed to assess whether relationships exist between the pitch processing mechanisms for music and prosody in WS. Children with WS and typically developing individuals were presented with a <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> and two prosody discrimination tasks. In the <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> discrimination task, participants were required to distinguish whether two musical tones were the same or different. The prosody discrimination tasks evaluated participants’ skills for discriminating pairs of prosodic contours based on pitch or pitch, loudness and length, jointly. In WS, <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> discrimination was significantly correlated with performance on the prosody task assessing the discrimination of prosodic contours based on <b>pitch</b> only. Furthermore, <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> discrimination skills predicted performance on the prosody task based on pitch, and this relationship was not better explained by chronological age, vocabulary or auditory memory. These results suggest that children with WS process pitch in music and prosody through shared mechanisms. We discuss {{the implications of these}} results for theories of cognitive modularity. The implications of these results for intervention programs for individuals with WS are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{computational}} analysis of musical audio from recorded audio waveforms. This general problem includes, as sub-tasks, music transcription, extraction of <b>musical</b> <b>pitch,</b> dynamics, timbre, instrument identity, and source separation. Analysis of real musical signals is a highly ill-posed task which is made complicated {{by the presence of}} transient sounds, background interference or the complex structure of <b>musical</b> <b>pitches</b> in the time-frequency domain. This paper focuses on models and algorithms for computer transcription of multiple <b>musical</b> <b>pitches</b> in audio, elaborated from previous work by two of the authors. The audio data are supposedly pre-segmented into fixed pitch regimes such as individual chords. The models presented apply to pitched (tonal) music and are formulated via a Gabor representation of non-stationary signals. A Bayesian probabilistic structure is employed for representation of prior information about the parameters of the notes. This paper introduces a numerical Bayesian inference strategy for estimation of the pitches and other parameters of the waveform. The improved algorithm is much quicker, and makes the approach feasible in realistic sitautions. Results ar...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} explores how {{language}} experience may shape {{the correlation between}} lexical tone and <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> perception. A two domains (music and lexical tone) by two languages (tone, Mandarin Chinese and non-tone, Dutch) design is adopted. Participants were tested on their discrimination of Mandarin Chinese lexical tones, Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA), and Musical Ear Test (MET). The Chinese listeners outperformed the Dutch listeners on both MBEA and MET, but had comparable accuracies for the lexical tone discrimination. Importantly, a significant cross-domain correlation was only observed for the Dutch listeners {{but not for the}} Chinese listeners. For tone language listeners, once lexical tones have been acquired, native listeners perceive them as phonological categories, and split them from other pitch variations that do not play a phonemic role. Non-tone language listeners, on the other hand, perceive both lexical tones and <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> on a psycho-acoustical basis, hence exhibit a unified perception of pitch across the two domains.

40|$|People with {{absolute}} pitch (AP) {{are assumed to}} be unique in operating an automatic verbal encoding when recognizing <b>musical</b> <b>pitch.</b> It is therefore assumed that tonal stimuli with <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> may produce a specific interference in performing certain tasks requiring some sort of verbal encoding. In the auditory Stroop experiment, participant heard sung syllables and required to name their <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> (pitch naming) or simply repeat the syllables (syllable shadowing). Listeners without AP suffered interference from incongruent syllables in pitch naming, but did not from incongruent pitches in syllable shadowing. In contrast, listeners with AP suffered substantial interference in shadowing syllables sung with incongruent pitch as well as in naming pitches sung with incongruent syllables. In the experiment of irrelevant sound effect, sequences of randomly-ordered seven musical-pitch syllables (mi, so, la, etc.) or digits were presented visually as to-be-recalled items. Irrelevant sounds (piano tones, spoken syllables, or spoken digits) accompanied the to-be-recalled items. Participants were required to recall the visual items in order as exactly as presented ignoring the auditory stimuli. Both listeners with and without AP showed the greatest substantial interference effect in recalling items with which irrelevant speech sounds accompanied. Most interestingly, the piano tones produced significantly greater interference for the listeners with AP than for the listeners without AP. These results support the assumption that listeners with AP can’t suppress pitch labeling even when it brings disadvantages. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{takes as}} its initial Premise {{the idea that}} the {{rationales}} for the forms of pitch organisation employed within tonal music which have been adopted by music theorists have strongly affected those theorists` conceptions of music, and that it is of critical importance to music theory to investigate the potential origination of such rationales within the human sciences. Recent studies of <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> perception and cognition are examined, and an attempt is made to assess their capacity to provide sustainable rationales for pitch organisation in tonal music. Theoretical and experimental studies that focus on sensory processes are critically reviewed, and it is suggested that these do not adequately characterise important aspects of <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> organisation. Studies that examine more central cognitive constraints are discussed, and a detailed critique is made of recent cognitive-structural approaches to the representation of <b>musical</b> <b>pitch.</b> It is proposed that a significant aspect of tonal pitch organisation, diatonic structure, is neither adequately investigated nor provided with any compelling rationale by these studies. Three series of experiments on the perception and representation of diatonic structure are presented: it is suggested that the sensitivity to properties of diatonic structure shown by listeners in these and in other experiments implies that a representation of diatonicinterval structure constitutes {{an important component of the}} cognitive organisation of <b>musical</b> <b>pitch.</b> A possible basis fort his sensitivity is further explored, and a group-theoretic rationale for the musical use of diatonicism is proposed. The nature of the cognitive representation of diatonic interval structure is discussed. and relationships between diatonic structure. other western scale forms. tonality and (briefly) atonality are outlined...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} perceptual and cognitive structures that children employ when listening to <b>musical</b> <b>pitches.</b> A number of experiments utilised reaction {{time as the}} dependent variable to identify perceptually salient factors in <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> perception, particularly the cognitive organisation of <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> in a tonal context. A chronometrically measured forced-choice paired—comparisons experimental paradigm was used with {{children between the ages of}} six and eleven, with the discrimination of same and different notes in context-free and various contextual presentations tested by a computer—driven environment. Significant correlations suggest that the recognition of same and different notes in both context-free and contextual presentations was progressively facilitated, with responses exhibiting fewer errors and decreasing reaction times with increasing age. Although no significant difference was observed in mean correct reaction times between uncontextualised same and different conditions, significant differences in reaction times were observed within each condition when suffix notes were each contextualised by a major triad prefix. Furthermore, while no significant correlation was observed between same and different notes in context-free presentation, the subsequent contextualisation by a major triad prefix to each comparison suffix note produced a significant positive correlation suggesting that the contextualisation effects were systematic. A further experiment using a diminished triad prefix confirmed that the tonal specificity of the stimuli was related to the observed reaction times, with significant differences in correct reaction times for those stimuli which differed in the tonal range of their constituent pitches in relation to the circle of fifths. The observed differences in the reaction time of responses were interpreted as differential measures of the internalisation of <b>musical</b> <b>pitches</b> to a cognitive structure such as a tonal schema. The hypothesis that perceptual facilitation of the coding of redundancy within such a recognised and practised cognitive structure such as tonality was supported for children of this age...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} possible innate perceptual biases that may shape the phonological rule in Mandarin, T 3 sandhi. T 3 sandhi restricts the co-occurrence of two T 3 s and requires the first T 3 {{to change to}} a T 2. A second goal of the dissertation {{is to examine the}} cross-domain perception of pitch from infancy to adulthood. Mandarin and Dutch adult listeners participated in a categorical perception experiment and a speeded AX discrimination task. It is found that Mandarin listeners perceive Mandarin the T 2 -T 3 contrast categorically while Dutch listeners perceive this contrast in a psycho-acoustical manner. Nevertheless, both groups of listeners are more accurate in discriminating T 2 and T 3 if T 3 occurs first in the to-be-discriminated pair. This consistency provides strong evidence that there are innate perceptual biases favoring T 3 sandhi to occur in such a positional and asymmetrical way. Dutch infants show easier categorization of T 3 than of T 2. Hence, the discrimination asymmetry can be a result that T 3 works as a better referent in discrimination. Positive significant correlation between <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> processing and Mandarin lexical tone discrimination is observed among Dutch adult listeners but not Mandarin adult listeners. Dutch young infants (4 and 6 months old) show facilitated processing of <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> while they keep showing difficulties in discriminating Mandarin T 2 -T 3 contrast, which suggests separate music and speech processing from early infancy. Mandarin infants do not outperform Dutch infants in either <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> processing or lexical tone discrimination. No evidence has been found for the correlation between the perception of <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> and the perception of lexical tones in early infancy.

50|$|Tone {{deafness}} {{is characterized}} by the inability to discriminate between different pitches, which are directly related to the frequencies of sound waves. Tone deafness is a related, but distinct disorder from beat deafness. People with tone deafness can recognize beat and can move in time to music, but they cannot perceive pitch. People with beat deafness on the other hand, can recognize and distinguish between different tones as well as the average person and can usually sing in tune, so <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> is not the issue. Different areas of the brain in the auditory cortex are involved in the perception of <b>musical</b> <b>pitch</b> and melody, and researchers theorize that tone deafness can potentially be from any of these sections. Both beat deafness and tone deafness are derived from these same areas within the brain.|$|R
