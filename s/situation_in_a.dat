5|$|Although the French and British had {{intended}} to launch a spring offensive in 1917, the strategy was threatened in February, when the Russians admitted {{that they could not}} meet the commitment to a joint offensive, which reduced the two-front offensive to a French assault along the Aisne River. In March, the German army in the west , withdrew to the Hindenburg line in Operation Alberich, which negated the tactical assumptions underlying the plans for the French offensive. Until French troops advanced to compensate during the Battles of Arras, they encountered no German troops in the assault sector and it became uncertain whether the offensive would go forward. The French government desperately needed a victory to avoid civil unrest but the British were wary of proceeding, in view of the rapidly changing tactical <b>situation.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> meeting with Lloyd George, French commander-in-chief General Robert Nivelle persuaded the British Prime Minister, that if the British launched a diversionary assault to draw German troops away from the Aisne sector, the French offensive could succeed. It was agreed in the London Convention of 16 January, that the French assault on the Aisne would begin in mid-April and that the British would make a diversionary attack in the Arras sector approximately one week prior.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} Pleistocene era, a huge {{landslide}} {{occurred at the}} mountain, with approximately 25km³ of debris travelling some 120km, reaching the Pacific Ocean. An area of some 2,200km² was covered in landslide deposits. The currently active cone is situated within a large caldera that was probably formed {{by a combination of}} landslides and large eruptions. The lava is andesite containing 56-61% SiO2. About 300,000people live within 40km (25 miles) of the volcano, which makes it the most dangerous volcano in Mexico.

The prefecture-level city, located {{on the banks of}} the Yellow River, is a key {{regional}} transportation hub, connecting areas further west by rail to the eastern half of the country. Historically, it has been a major link on the Northern Silk Road. The city is also a center for heavy industry and petrochemical industry. Lanzhou was previously ranked as one of the cities with the worst air quality in the world, due to industrial pollution and its <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> narrow river valley. Government measures to reduce the pollution have had their effect, and in 2015 the city was awarded China's climate progress title.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this unique status and of the complex {{political}} <b>situation,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> city divided from 1948 to 1967 between Israel and Jordan, the Consul General had to cross Mandelbaum Gate on a daily basis to reach the new premises of the Consulate General situated in East Jerusalem - first in the French national domain of St Anne's church and later in Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. The severance of diplomatic relations with Jordan from 1956 to 1962 made the situation yet more difficult to manage. King Hussein of Jordan questioned the status of French schools and religious congregations in Jordan, and the political and economic privileges to which they were entitled. He tried to end the duality of foreign diplomatic representation by removing laissez-passer for diplomatic missions.|$|E
25|$|With Mike Morris and Ulvi Yurtsever {{he showed}} that {{traversable}} Lorentzian wormholes can {{exist in the}} structure of spacetime only if they are threaded by quantum fields in quantum states that violate the averaged null energy condition (i.e. have negative renormalized energy spread over a sufficiently large region). This has triggered research to explore the ability of quantum fields to possess such extended negative energy. Recent calculations by Thorne indicate that simple masses passing through traversable wormholes could never engender paradoxes – there are no initial conditions that lead to paradox once time travel is introduced. If his results can be generalized, they would suggest that none of the supposed paradoxes formulated in time travel stories can actually be formulated at a precise physical level: that is, that any <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> time travel story turns out to permit many consistent solutions.|$|E

25|$|There were {{generally}} two approaches to metering losses. The first was attritional - operations {{were conducted to}} inflict maximum losses on ARVN/US forces. This meant expending lives and resources in attacks (ambushes, raids etc.) or in defensive operations (digging in to fight, bleeding opponents and then withdrawing when enemy forces grew too strong). Attacks were scaled up or down depending on a myriad of factors including the political <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> particular area. The second approach was avoidance of battle unless numerical superiority and chances of success were good. In the Vietnam War, most Communist units (including mobile NVA regulars using guerrilla tactics) spent {{only a limited number}} of days a year fighting. While they might be forced into an unwanted battle by an ARVN/US action, most of the time was spent in population control, training, intelligence gathering, propaganda indoctrination or construction of fortifications, with Communist troops typically only fighting an average of 1 day in 30. In essence, the VC/NVA largely fought on the ground only when they wanted to fight.|$|E
25|$|Peter {{resigned}} as dean around 1202, and explained the <b>situation</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> letter to Innocent III. He {{claimed that the}} church was subject only to the archbishop and the king, under the Pope: later deans were to seek freedom from the archbishop too, with some success. He claimed that the indiscipline of the canons was such that it brought forth hissing and derision from the entire population. The solution he proposed was to replace the institution with a Cistercian abbey. Peter had already put forward the plan to Hubert Walter and won his and John's support for it. Walter dissolved the college and, with Papal approval, John handed over the deanery and prebends to him in January 1203, {{in preparation for the}} new venture. A year later, the king granted a charter of liberties for the abbey and endowed it with properties, including the manors of Wolverhampton and Tettenhall. Cistercian monks had already begun to move into the site, although John had appointed one Nicholas as dean on Peter's resignation. However, with the death of Hubert Walter in 1205, the entire project lapsed and John appointed as dean Henry, son of Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex.|$|E
