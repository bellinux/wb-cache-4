40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} contrast material-enhanced multi-detector row computed tomographic (CT) colonography for preoperative staging of colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one patients with colorectal carcinoma underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced multi-detector row CT colonography. Images were obtained in the arterial (<b>start</b> <b>delay</b> of 35 seconds) and portal venous (<b>start</b> <b>delay</b> of 70 seconds) phases. The arterial phase {{was focused on the}} suspected region of neoplasm, whereas the venous phase included the whole abdomen and pelvis. Two radiologists independently evaluated the depth of tumor invasion into the colorectal wall (T) and regional lymph node involvement (N) on transverse CT images alone and in combination with multiplanar reformations (MPRs). Disagreements were resolved by means of consensus. CT findings were compared with pathologic results, which served as the reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were assessed. Differences in accuracy for T and N staging were assessed by using the McNemar test. RESULTS: In T staging, overall accuracy was 73 % when transverse images were evaluated alone and 83 % when they were evaluated in combination with MPRs. This difference was not significant. N staging was associated with an overall accuracy of 59 % with transverse images alone and 80 % with combined transverse and MPR images (P <. 01). CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced multi-detector row CT colonography is an accurate technique for preoperative local staging of colorectal tumors. Copyright RSNA, 200...|$|E

40|$|P 2 P based live {{streaming}} applications {{are growing up}} rapidly. However, when extending them to WLANs, the bandwidth bottleneck and {{the high rate of}} packet loss are usually the major stumbling blocks. To overcome this issue, a new wireless multicast agent mechanism (WiMA) based on the IP multicast scheme for buffer management and scheduling is proposed. First of all, a wireless agent selection method is presented to choose an appropriate agent for WiMA. Then this agent gains media data by interacting with wired neighbor peers as a common P 2 P node, and transmits these data to other wireless peers in the WLAN by means of multicast pushing and multicast patching. A normal wireless peer requests data according to the strategy of "emergent ones first". Experimental results show that the approach proposed can significantly save bandwidth in WLANs with acceptable <b>start</b> <b>delay</b> and satisfied playing continuity. 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{the design and}} implementation of seamless playback for video/audio in the Ambulant Player. The Ambulant Open SMIL Player is an open-source media player that supports SMIL 3. 0. A typical SMIL multimedia presentation consists {{of a set of}} declarative references to video/audio clips, which are relative to each other in terms of temporal and spatial relationships. Unfortunately, the declarative nature of SMIL often imposes performance delays, as individual items are fetched and presented. In this paper, we discuss the design and implemention of a caching and prefetching scheme that avoids service interruption and eliminate switch delay among these clips. A collection of videos is thereby rendered as if they were continuously rendered from one media container on one media source. Experiments are carried out to validate that our techniques can significantly lower the <b>start</b> <b>delay</b> of media rendering and therefore realize the seamless playback of SMIL multimedia presentations. © 2006 IEEE...|$|E

In such a case, it is reasonable to start new movies as soon as possible because there is no external queuing delay.

30|$|Our study adds {{reliability}} to {{the findings}} of earlier studies [11 – 15] and the generally held view of many surgeons and anaesthetist that operating theatres are less efficient than they could be. Moreover, we have shown that these inefficiencies are costly and represent a waste of resources that could be better spent on reducing waiting lists and improving opportunities for staff training. In particular, we have highlighted a key problem area, the arrival of the first patient to theatres which resulted in 93 % (N[*]=[*] 43) of the morning lists analysed (N[*]=[*] 46) starting late. This translated to a mean wait by the surgical team after the agreed start time of 22  min at an average cost of £ 88 per list. These findings are not isolated to gynaecology theatres, Ricketts et al. in a review of 151 elective orthopaedic lists found late starts in 94 % of lists and an average <b>start</b> <b>delay</b> in morning lists of 24  min [13]. While Narain et al. in a computer audit of the use of theatre time reported 97 % late starts in general surgery [15]. Both of these studies were carried out in the early 1990 s, showing clearly the problem of late starts is a persistent one.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficient}} use of operating lists is important to clear waiting lists {{and because they are}} expensive to run (at 1988 prices, 151 pounds per hour). Of general surgical theatre session time, 49 % is used for performing operations, but no survey of orthopaedic theatre sessions has been published. In light of this we surveyed 151 elective orthopaedic lists at three hospitals. Our aims were to determine the use of operating rooms and the reasons for in{{efficient use}} of time. We found 60 % of elective list time was used for operating and 21 % for turnover. No useful activity occurred during the remaining 19 % of theatre time. An average <b>start</b> <b>delay</b> of 26. 5 min and average early finish of 14. 5 min contributed to this. Only 9 / 151 (6 %) of lists started within 5 min of the scheduled time. Of unnecessary delays contributing to this, 63 % involved anaesthetic staff and 24 % theatre staff. Surgeons were implicated in 10 % of start delays. There were less start delays if senior anaesthetic staff were present. During lists, turnover times were quicker if a consultant surgeon was present (P = 0. 0022). We conclude that more {{efficient use of}} elective orthopaedic theatre sessions is possible and could be achieved if more detailed preparation was undertaken by the anaesthetic, theatre and surgical staff concerned.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We report our {{prospective}} study evaluating biphasic helical CT of the aorta after endoluminal stent-graft placement. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Biphasic helical CT scans in 95 patients with abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysms {{who had undergone}} endoluminal stent-graft placement were reviewed. After a test bolus injection of 15 ml of contrast media {{at a rate of}} 3. 5 ml/sec for the measurement of the optimal <b>start</b> <b>delay,</b> the aorta was scanned using the following parameters: collimation of 5 mm, table speed of 7 mm per rotation, tube rotation time of 0. 75 sec, 120 kV, and 295 mA. A delayed helical CT scan was obtained 15 sec after the initial acquisition using the same parameters. RESULTS: Biphasic helical CT scans showed perigraft leakage in 45 (47 %) of 95 patients. Leakage was shown only on arterial phase CT in eight patients and only on the delayed scans in three patients. In two patients, leakage shown on the delayed acquisition was retrospectively seen on the first scan. Leakage and outflow vessels were most visible on the arterial phase acquisition in 17 patients and on the second acquisition in six patients. Overall, biphasic acquisition was superior to arterial phase acquisition alone in 15 (16 %) of 95 patients. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic value of biphasic helical CT is superior to arterial phase acquisition alone for the evaluation of the aorta after endoluminal stent-graft therapy.

40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} cause damage {{to all of}} the major {{cellular}} constituents, including peroxidation of lipids. Previous studies have revealed that oxidative stress, including exposure to oxidation products, affects the progression of cells through the cell division cycle. This study examined the effect of linoleic acid hydroperoxide, a lipid peroxidation product, on the yeast cell cycle. Treatment with this peroxide led to accumulation of unbudded cells in asynchronous populations, together with a budding and replication delay in synchronous ones. This observed modulation of G 1 progression could be distinguished from the lethal effects of the treatment and may have been due to a checkpoint mechanism, analogous to that known to be involved in effecting cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. By examining several mutants sensitive to linoleic acid hydroperoxide, the YNL 099 c open reading frame was found to be required for the arrest. This gene (designated OCA 1) encodes a putative protein tyrosine phosphatase of previously unknown function. Cells lacking OCA 1 did not accumulate in G 1 on treatment with linoleic acid hydroperoxide, nor did they show a budding, replication, or <b>Start</b> <b>delay</b> in synchronous cultures. Although not essential for adaptation or immediate cellular survival, OCA 1 was required for growth in the presence of linoleic acid hydroperoxide, thus indicating that it may function in linking growth, stress responses, and the cell cycle.

40|$|There {{are some}} {{advantages}} of using {{quantitative risk assessment}} methods over more traditional qualitative risk assessment methods. The cost and schedule impacts of project risks can be better described when using quantitative methods. This in turn allows contingency calculations to be more scientific than when using more traditional methods. In many cases, these quantitative risk registers are standalone MS Excel based entities. This represents a problem {{in that it is}} difficult and impractical to use these separate risk registers to do a concurrent Monte Carlo simulation. This thesis therefore presents a model which uses the Monte Carlo method to quantify certain risk and project categories in a portfolio of 86 port and rail capital projects. The purpose of the model is to provide a portfolio-wide view of risks to answer the questions What matters most? and Where should the focus be regarding risk treatment plans?. The answers to these questions should then be used to identify policies and procedures which need to be changed to improve the project delivery and execution process. The model was based on the principles of the ISO 31000 : 2009 risk management process, MS Excel spreadsheets and @Risk simulation software to generate output distributions which are ranked using various methodologies. The risk and project categories which were used in the model included the following: Project type: Each of the 86 projects in the project portfolio was assigned to one of 15 different project categories. The initial expectation was that certain risk names in the project portfolio would cause the most uncertainty. Risk type: This refers to the control the project owner and the project team have over influencing the likelihood and consequences which are associated with specific risks. Five different types were used: External uncontrollable, External Influencable, Internal Owner Requirement, Internal Operational and Internal Project Processes. Risk name: A total of 165 risk names were used to describe 1063 different risks which belonged to the 86 projects. Project start delays: Certain risks delay the execution start of projects and therefore caused the escalation of project cost due to inflation. Risks associated with programmes: The model classified each risk in terms of three types defined by Aritua (2011, 311) : Generic Project Risks, risks which are Amplified in Programmes and risks which are Common to Programmes. The initial assumption that certain risk names drive uncertainty in the project portfolio was disproved using the unique risk simulation approach developed in this thesis. It was also shown in a unique manner, using various risk categories, that uncertainty in the project portfolio was driven by eight large, complex, multistakeholder projects. The next risk category which caused the most uncertainty was controllable risks, followed by <b>start</b> <b>delay</b> risks, planning risks and lastly policy related risks. The main contributions of the thesis are identified as: Amount and quality of the unique data which was gathered for this research. Limited information was available regarding risk simulation in a portfolio or program of projects, especially for a large, complex portfolio. A total of 165 different risk names were identified during the research. Each of the risks were assigned to various risk categories in a unique manner as part of a detailed risk analysis to determine What Matters most/ and Where to focus?. The way in which the simulation model and accompanied framework was developed. The literature review identified a gap in how simulation models related to the ranking of risks in portfolios of projects can be developed and which questions to ask during the risk analysis process. This gap was filled by a detailed description of how such a model can be built and how risk aggregation can take place in a project portfolio, using unique combinations of functions in spreadsheets and risk simulation software standards MS Excel and @Risk functions.
