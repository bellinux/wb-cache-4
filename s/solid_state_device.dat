2500|$|Such an {{analysis}} was performed by Di Ventra and Pershin {{with regard to the}} genuine current-controlled memristor. As the proposed dynamic state equation [...] provides no physical mechanism enabling such a memristor to cope with inevitable thermal fluctuations, a current-controlled memristor would erratically change its state in course of time just under the influence of current noise. Di Ventra and Pershin thus concluded that memristors whose resistance (memory) states depend solely on the current or voltage history would be unable to protect their memory states against unavoidable Johnson–Nyquist noise and permanently suffer from information loss, a so-called [...] "stochastic catastrophe". A current-controlled memristor can thus not exist as a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>device</b> in physical reality.|$|E

50|$|A {{thermoelectric}} generator (TEG), also called a Seebeck generator, is a <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>device</b> that converts heat flux (temperature differences) directly into electrical energy through a phenomenon called the Seebeck effect (a form of thermoelectric effect).

Current file system and device level I/O scheduler design is optimized for rotational magnetic hard disk drives. Since <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>devices</b> have drastically different properties and structure, we may need to rethink the design of some aspects of the file system and scheduler levels of the I/O subsystem. In this paper, we consider the current approach to I/O scheduling and show that the current scheduler design may not be ideally suited to <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>devices.</b> We also present a framework for extracting some <b>device</b> parameters of <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> drives.

One of the benefits of the SSD technology is that the typical disk drive, which uses a rotating platter and moving components, [...] is replaced with a completely <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>device.</b> In this context, SSD devices are not subject to the effects of extreme vibration and shock conditions that a typical disk drive does. By combining the media with the host bus adapter, connecting cabling is eliminated which is another source of system failure.|$|E

50|$|A {{maritime}} VSAT is a VSAT {{with features}} that {{allow it to}} be operated on a ship at sea. A ship that is underway is in continuous motion in all axes. The antenna part of a marine VSAT system must be stabilized with respect to the horizon and true north as the ship moves beneath it. Motors and sensors are used to keep the antenna pointed accurately at the satellite. This enables it to transmit to and receive from the satellite whilst minimising losses and interference with adjacent satellites.
