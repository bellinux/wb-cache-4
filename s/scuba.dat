5|$|As the <b>scuba</b> set is a {{life support}} system, no {{unauthorised}} person should touch a diver's assembled <b>scuba</b> gear, even to move it, without their knowledge and approval.|$|E
5|$|Empty <b>scuba</b> tanks or <b>scuba</b> tanks {{pressurized}} at {{less than}} 200kPa are not restricted as hazardous materials. <b>Scuba</b> cylinders are only allowed in checked baggage or as a carry-on if the cylinder valve is completely disconnected from the cylinder and the cylinder has an open end {{to allow for a}} visual inspection inside.|$|E
5|$|Glover's {{favourite}} sports pastime is <b>scuba</b> {{diving in}} her travels, and her favourite diving location is the Red Sea. She passed her open water certification in Malta, and an advanced <b>scuba</b> diving course in Borneo.|$|E
5|$|A diving {{cylinder}}, <b>scuba</b> tank or {{diving tank}} is a gas cylinder used to store and transport the high pressure breathing gas required by a <b>scuba</b> set. It {{may also be}} used for surface-supplied diving or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or <b>scuba.</b> Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of a diving regulator or the breathing loop of a diving rebreather.|$|E

5|$|Legal {{constraints}} to filling <b>scuba</b> cylinders {{will vary}} by jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|<b>Scuba</b> {{cylinders}} {{are required}} {{to comply with the}} colours and markings specified in SANS 10019:2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice between}} <b>scuba</b> and surface {{supplied}} diving equipment {{is based on}} both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, <b>scuba</b> is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly commercial diving, may be restricted to surface supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice.|$|E
5|$|Argon is {{used for}} thermal {{insulation}} in energy-efficient windows. Argon is also used in technical <b>scuba</b> diving to inflate a dry suit because it is inert and has low thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|Ascent {{rate was}} chosen at 60 fsw/min as a {{compromise}} between the practical requirements for military <b>scuba</b> and surface supplied diving operations.|$|E
5|$|Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather <b>scuba</b> systems allow {{recycling}} of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced {{compared to that}} of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. They far extend the time spent underwater as compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers produce fewer bubbles and less noise than <b>scuba</b> which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Bradner (November 5, 1915 â€“ May 5, 2008) was an American {{physicist}} at the University of California who {{is credited with}} inventing the neoprene wetsuit, which helped to revolutionize <b>scuba</b> diving.|$|E
5|$|Male <b>scuba</b> divers {{utilizing}} condom catheters {{and female}} divers utilizing external catching devices for their dry suits are also susceptible to urinary tract infections.|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{may also}} occur {{following}} {{the use of}} a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (<b>SCUBA)</b> due to faulty diving air compressors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Scuba</b> divers {{engaged in}} armed forces covert {{operations}} may {{be referred to}} as frogmen, combat divers or attack swimmers.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are manufactured}} with domed (convex) and dished (concave) bottoms. The dished profile {{allows them to}} stand upright on a horizontal surface, and is the standard shape for industrial cylinders. The cylinders used for emergency gas supply on diving bells are often this shape, and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres ("J"). Domed bottoms give a larger volume for the same cylinder mass, and are the standard for <b>scuba</b> cylinders up to 18 litres water capacity, though some concave bottomed cylinders have been marketed for <b>scuba.</b>|$|E
5|$|The flooded Monte Ne {{has become}} a site of {{interest}} for <b>scuba</b> divers who dive by the amphitheater {{to get a look}} at the submerged structure. The water is moderately clear and temperatures comfortable.|$|E
5|$|A <b>scuba</b> diver moves {{underwater}} {{by using}} fins {{attached to the}} feet; external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a towboard pulled from the surface. Other equipment includes a diving mask to improve underwater vision, a protective diving suit, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. <b>Scuba</b> divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these diver certifications. These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment {{and dealing with the}} general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of fitness and health is required by most training organisations, and a higher level of fitness may be needed for some applications.|$|E
5|$|All cadets take a {{prescribed}} series {{of physical fitness}} courses such as military movement (applied gymnastics), boxing, survival swimming, and beginning in 2009, advanced combatives. Cadets can also take elective physical activity classes such as <b>scuba,</b> rock climbing, and aerobic fitness.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{receives}} a spear gun-armed underwater jet pack <b>scuba</b> (allowing the frogman to manoeuvre faster than other frogmen). Designed by Jordan Klein, green dye {{was meant to}} be used by Bond as a smoke screen to escape pursuers. Instead Ricou Browning, the film's underwater director, used it to make Bond's arrival more dramatic.|$|E
5|$|He {{became a}} full {{professor}} in 1963 and retired in 1980. He remained interested in oceanography, <b>scuba</b> diving, seashell collecting and the outdoors throughout his later years, {{and continued to}} work both on oceanographic research, {{as well as on}} the DUMAND deep ocean neutrino astronomy project, which combined his two careers in physics and oceanography.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, oxygen {{has become}} {{available}} for recreational use in oxygen bars. The US Food and Drug Administration has warned those suffering from {{problems such as}} heart or lung disease not to use oxygen bars. <b>Scuba</b> divers use breathing gases containing up to 100% oxygen, and should have specific training in using such gases.|$|E
5|$|Keeping this in mind, it is {{not hard}} to see why {{technical}} divers who do long deep dives require multiple cylinders or rebreathers, and commercial divers normally use surface-supplied diving equipment, and only carry <b>scuba</b> as an emergency gas supply.|$|E
5|$|Most {{countries}} require diving cylinders to {{be checked}} on a regular basis. This usually consists of an internal visual inspection and a hydrostatic test. The inspection and testing requirements for <b>scuba</b> cylinders may {{be very different from}} the requirements for other compressed gas containers due to the more corrosive environment.|$|E
5|$|Only 4.46% of the {{recreational}} diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable {{to a single}} contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose {{as a result of}} a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in professional <b>scuba</b> diving is due to this factor. The study also concluded that it would be impossible to completely eliminate all minor contraindications of <b>scuba</b> diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and bring all diving to a halt.|$|E
5|$|Open circuit <b>scuba</b> systems {{discharge}} {{the breathing}} gas {{into the environment}} as it is exhaled, and consist {{of one or more}} diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high pressure which is supplied to the diver through a diving regulator. They may include additional cylinders for decompression gas or emergency breathing gas.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth is an {{important}} centre for watersports, especially <b>scuba</b> diving and sailing. The Port of Plymouth Regatta {{is one of the}} oldest regattas in the world, and has been held regularly since 1823. In September 2011, Plymouth hosted the America's Cup World Series for nine days.|$|E
5|$|<b>Scuba</b> diving {{fatalities}} have a {{major financial}} impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. Equipment failure is rare in open circuit <b>scuba,</b> and when {{the cause of death}} is recorded as drowning, it is usually the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events in which drowning is the endpoint because it occurred in water, while the initial cause remains unknown. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, often as a consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, occasionally aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety.|$|E
5|$|Weh Island is {{also known}} for ecotourism. Underwater diving, hiking through the {{volcanic}} mountain and beach resorts are the main attractions. A small village, Iboih, {{is known as a}} location for <b>scuba</b> diving. A few meters from Iboih is the Rubiah islet that is known for its coral reefs. There are also several dive operators in Gapang.|$|E
5|$|When inhaled at high partial {{pressures}} (more {{than about}} 4 bar, encountered at depths below about 30m in <b>scuba</b> diving), nitrogen is an anesthetic agent, causing nitrogen narcosis, a temporary state of mental impairment similar to nitrous oxide intoxication.|$|E
5|$|With the Orca slowly sinking, {{the trio}} attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on <b>scuba</b> gear {{and enters the}} water in a shark-proof cage, {{intending}} to lethally inject the shark with strychnine using a hypodermic spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly, killing Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody stuffs a pressurized <b>scuba</b> tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the mast, shoots the tank with Quint's rifle, destroying it. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces, and he and Brody paddle to Amity Island clinging to boat wreckage.|$|E
5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} line used by <b>scuba</b> divers {{to fasten}} {{themselves}} to something. The original purpose was to fasten a diver to a shot line during decompression stops in current. The line is typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip at each end. One clip is fastened to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used to fasten the line to the anchor line. In current this relieves the diver from holding on to the anchor line during the decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} leisure spots and {{conservation}} areas are available around Sandakan. The Sepilok Orang Utan Sanctuary {{is a place}} where orphaned or injured orangutans are brought to be rehabilitated to return to forest life. Established in 1964, it is one of only four orangutan sanctuaries in the world. Other conservation areas are the Malaysian Turtle Islands where many turtles lay their eggs on the islands. They cover an area of 1,740 hectares which includes the surrounding reefs and seas. The islands are also ideal for swimming, snorkelling and <b>scuba</b> diving.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a <b>scuba</b> diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{watching}} (primarily in the Hawar Islands), <b>scuba</b> diving, {{and horse}} riding are popular tourist activities in Bahrain. Many tourists from nearby Saudi Arabia {{and across the}} region visit Manama primarily for the shopping malls in the capital Manama, such as the Bahrain City Centre and Seef Mall in the Seef district of Manama. The Manama Souq and Gold Souq in the old district of Manama are also popular with tourists.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{changes in}} the liquid in the cnida make it a much more {{concentrated}} solution, so that osmotic pressure forces water in very rapidly to dilute it. This mechanism has been observed in nematocysts of the class Hydrozoa, sometimes producing pressures as high as 140 atmospheres, {{similar to that of}} <b>scuba</b> air tanks, and fully extending the thread in as little as 2milliseconds (0.002second).|$|E
