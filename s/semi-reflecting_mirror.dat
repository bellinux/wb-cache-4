40|$|Summary. A {{theory of}} the Mach-Zehnder {{interferometer}} is developed using the approach of investigating {{the history of a}} wave front produced by an element of an extended light source. Account is taken of the effects of imperfections of the optical components including all the first-order aberrations of the collimating and collecting lenses or mirrors and of the camera lens. The theory can also be applied to other two-beam interferometers. 1. Introduction. The Mach-Zehnder interferometer is one of a large class of instruments in which two-beam interference is produced by division of amplitude. Its principle of operation is simple and can be stated very briefly, if the components of the instrument are assumed to be optically perfect. Referring to Fig. 1, S, a point source of monochromatic light in the focal plane of a perfect collimating lens L produces a parallel beam of light which meets a <b>semi-reflecting</b> <b>mirror</b> M 1...|$|E
