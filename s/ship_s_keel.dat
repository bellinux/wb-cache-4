40|$|B. Hassett and <b>S.</b> <b>Keel</b> {{predicted}} {{that there is}} a descending sequence of critical α values where the log canonical model for the moduli space of stable curves with respect to αδ changes, where δ denotes the divisor of singular curves. We derive a conjectural formula for the critical values in two different ways, by working out the intersection theory of the moduli space of hyperelliptic curves and by computing the GIT stability of certain curves with tails and bridges. The results give a rough outline of how the log minimal model program would proceed, telling us when the log canonical model changes and which curves are to be discarded and acquired at the critical steps...|$|R
40|$|The Cox ring of {{a smooth}} {{algebraic}} projective variety X is the direct sum of H^ 0 (X,D) as D varies in the Picard group of X. The ring {{was introduced by}} Y. Hu and <b>S.</b> <b>Keel</b> in 2000 and generalizes Cox' construction of the homogenous coordinate ring of a toric variety. The main reason for studying these rings is that Cox(X) is finitely generated {{if and only if}} X is a so-called Mori dream space, and this has strong implications for the birational geometry of X. The aim of this thesis is to survey some properties of Cox rings and present some new results about Cox rings of rational surfaces and threefolds occurring as blow-ups of P^ 2 and P^ 3 and some special K 3 surfaces of Picard number two...|$|R

The bill was intended to enter into force at 9:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time, 29 August 2001 (s 2); thus making the bill retroactive.
