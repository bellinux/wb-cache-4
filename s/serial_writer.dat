6000|$|If the {{biographies of}} {{literary}} men are {{to assume the}} bulk which Mr. Masson is giving to that of Milton, their authors should send a phial of elixir vitae with the first volume, that a purchaser might have some valid assurance of surviving to see the last. Mr. Masson has already occupied thirteen hundred and seventy-eight pages in getting Milton to his thirty-fifth year, and an interval of eleven years stretches between the dates {{of the first and}} second instalments of his published labors. As Milton's literary life properly begins at twenty-one, with the [...] "Ode on the Nativity," [...] and as by far the more important part of it lies between the year at which we are arrived and his death at the age of sixty-six, we might seem to have the terms given us by which to make a rough reckoning of how soon we are likely to see land. But when we recollect the baffling character of the winds and currents we have already encountered, and the eddies that may at any time slip us back to the reformation in Scotland or the settlement of New England; when we consider, moreover, that Milton's life overlapped the grand siècle of French literature, with its irresistible temptations to digression and homily for a man of Mr Masson's temperament, we may be pardoned if a sigh of doubt and discouragement escape us. We envy the secular leisures of Methusaleh, and are thankful that his biography at least (if written in the same longeval proportion) is irrecoverably lost to us. What a subject would that have been for a person of Mr. Masson's spacious predilections! Even if he himself can count on patriarchal prorogations of existence, let him hang a print of the Countess of Desmond in his study to remind him of the ambushes which Fate lays for the toughest of us. For myself, I have not dared to climb a cherry-tree since I began to read his work. Even with the promise of a speedy third volume before me, I feel by no means sure of living to see Mary Powell back in her husband's house; for it is just at this crisis that Mr. Masson, with the diabolical art of a practised <b>serial</b> <b>writer,</b> leaves us while he goes into an exhaustive account of the Westminster Assembly and the political and religious notions of the Massachusetts Puritans.

40|$|The {{construction}} of national or regional cultural identities in Europe in the 19 th and 20 th centuries did not imply {{the cessation of}} intercultural exchanges. On the contrary, numerous studies (a. o. Thiesse 1999, Leerssen 2006) have demonstrated that the affirmation of cultural identities went {{hand in hand with}} an intensification of intra- and international transfers in the fields of art and literature, which ensured the recognition of emerging cultures both within and beyond their borders (Thiesse 1999; Leerssen 2006). These exchanges, or cultural transfers, were orchestrated by (networks of) cultural mediators who, by translating and manipulating cultural discourses beyond (national, cultural and linguistic) borders, played a prominent role in the process of production and diffusion of cultural representations (D’hulst et al 2014). Despite their crucial role in the organization of literary and artistic life, this category of mediators has long been neglected, most likely {{due to the fact that}} these actors were active at the crossroads of languages, nations, arts and cultures, and thus escaped the unidisciplinary methodological and theoretical frameworks, which traditionally place individuals within rather fixed national, artistic and linguistic frameworks. Starting from this idea and in response to the need to develop an intercultural historiography of Belgian cultural and literary practices (Meylaerts 2004; D’hulst 2012; Verschaffel 2008), this PhD dissertation seeked to study the mediating role played by a Belgian intercultural actor between Paris, Antwerp and Brussels in relation to the process of {{construction of}} (post) national cultures: Georges Eekhoud (1854 - 1927). By applying a new perspective on this well-known literary figure, i. e. by adopting the flexible perspective of the mediator, by “following” him through his transfer networks (Buzelin 2005) and by allowing the “borders to manifest themselves” (Latour 2006), this study highlighted a set of unexpected transfer activities and mediating roles, especially relevant to understand the intercultural and identity mechanisms in Belgium at the turn of the 20 th century and, by extension, in heterogeneous and multilingual cultures. Contrary to the traditional image, Georges Eekhoud’s writer daily life was characterized by a continuum of interconnected multilingual roles and practices (e. g. author, translator, bilingual columnist, multilingual art and literary critic, foreign correspondent, etc.), touching upon literary, critical and mass market outlets and transgressing linguistic, artistic and national “barriers”. Through these various roles and the daily maintenance of an extensive network of writers and artists, Georges Eekhoud appears to have benefited to the fullest possible extent from the cultural and linguistic heterogeneity of the Belgian space in order to “earn a living with his pen”. My study demonstrated how Eekhoud’s canonized literary production could not be understood without taking into account his complex and overlapping mediating activities as a bilingual <b>serial</b> <b>writer,</b> translator, art critic and chronicler. Firstly, Eekhoud made wide use of what I have called ‘cultural recycling’. He did indeed “recycle”, in return for a few transformations, the “same” identity discourses on non-literary or less prestigious platforms (chronicles and essays in French, Dutch and Flemish journals, bilingual serialised novels, bilingual artistics monographies), i. e. a homogenising “patriotic” discourse promoting exclusively the Flemish culture, art and languages. Secondly, the largely unregulated genre of the serialised novel appeared as a heterogeneous space for the reuse, recycling and validation of critical and novelistic outlets: a laboratory where Eekhoud superposed various transfer techniques (translation, adaptation, plagiarism, bilingual collaborative writing) and experimented with new themes and new literary practices, which via self-plagiarism directly interfered with his prestigious “Parisian” production, thus contributing to innovations in the national literary repertoires. In order to convey a Flemish “patriotic” selection without compromising his pivotal position between and within several national and international networks, Eekhoud employed discursive mediation strategies to alternately insert his identity discourses within a Belgian patriotic framework (“the Belgian soul”), within a flamingant cultural framework (Flanders as a homogeneous Dutch-speaking whole), within a Groot-Nederland artistic framework (Flanders as part of the former Netherlands) or within a Parisian discourse that then saw the Flemish topoi as an attractive and foreignizing Belgian theme (Nordic Myth). Between the homogenising transferred discourses and the heterogenising underying transfer process, between translation and original, between French and Flemish, Eekhoud’s production proved to be fundamentally hybrid, bearing the traces of the relationships that brought it into existence. These observations regarding Georges Eekhoud’s cultural and literary trajectory involved an expansive series of lines of thought concerning the relationships between Flemish and Francophone literatures in Belgium during the “Belle Époque”. The interdisciplinary method I developped, responding to the calls raised among Translation scholars to move further in the developement of a more agent- and process-oriented type of research (Folaron & Buzelin 2007) and to consider the conceptual and historical relationships between transfer and translation (Göpferich 2007), demonstrated that these interactions were far more direct (via simultaneous writing-translation, plagiarism, etc.) and pragmatic (commercial motives, collaboration) than one might imagine. The combination of certain activities, genres and languages then appeared as more easily achievable than others, revealing the place of borders in certain combinations rather than in the sole national or linguistic transgression. Finally, I redefined the cultural mediator as someone who simultaneously assumes various roles, who occupies a strategic position between and within several networks, who transforms the products and texts that he/she is supposed to report, and who blocks, selects and manipulates cultural representations based on individual and collective objectives and multiple constraints. The mediator does not invalidate the borders that he/she transgresses. Rather, he/she uses, shifts, specifies and defines them by juxtaposing a source language or culture on the one hand with a target language or culture on the other. He/she finally produces unstable homogenising cultural discourses that simultaneously legitimize his/her intermediate position and witness of a complex perception and instrumentalisation of his/her own sociocultural and sociolinguistic framework. status: publishe...|$|E
