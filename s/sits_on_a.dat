5|$|A {{fibreglass}} {{replica of}} a Mk XVI spitfire <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pylon next to Memorial Avenue at Christchurch Airport, New Zealand. It was moved to its current location in 2015 from the previous position {{at the entrance to}} the airport where it had been for 50 years. The replica was apparently used as a static display in Reach for the Sky.|$|E
5|$|Assessing Valencia's hitting during 2010 spring training, Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said: “I {{guarantee}} you one thing, he can hit a fastball; {{and if he}} <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> breaking ball, he can hit that, too.” On June 3, Valencia was called up to replace Michael Cuddyer, who had {{been placed on the}} bereavement list following the death of his father-in-law. In his debut that day, he went 1 for 3.|$|E

5|$|The castle is divided, {{along its}} length, into three enclosures, each {{separated}} by a deep dry moat. There are some similarities with Château Gaillard, built by Richard the Lionheart in the closing years of the 12thcentury, which also consists of three enclosures and <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> promontory above a nearby town.|$|E
5|$|The house <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> south facing slope giving views {{across the}} {{extensive}} deer {{park and the}} Weald beyond. Kitchen gardens {{to the north of}} the house remain as remnants of 16th-century formal garden planting. The house is a Grade I listed building and its barn is listed Grade II. The parks and gardens are listed Grade II.|$|E
5|$|Two hazards {{are uniquely}} {{identified}} with the dam. One is that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon, {{and the other is}} that the dam <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> seismic fault. At current levels, 80% of the land in the area is experiencing erosion, depositing about 40million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually. Because the flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment will now settle there instead of flowing downstream, and there will be less sediment downstream.|$|E

5|$|Calabozos and the {{majority}} of the Andean volcanoes formed from the subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate under the continental South American continental lithosphere. The caldera is in a transitional region between thick and thin lithosphere, and is probably supplied by a pool of andesitic and rhyolitic magma. It <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> historic bed of volcanic and plutonic sedimentary rock (rock formed within the Earth) that in turn sits on top of a layer of merged sedimentary and metamorphic rock.|$|E
5|$|In Jötunheimr, the jötunn Þrymr <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> barrow, {{plaiting}} golden collars for {{his female}} dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. Þrymr sees Loki, and asks {{what could be}} amiss among the Æsir and the elves; why is Loki alone in Jötunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the Æsir—that Thor's hammer, Mjöllnir, is gone. Þrymr {{says that he has}} hidden Mjöllnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved, but only if Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from Jötunheimr and back to the court of the gods.|$|E
5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight {{to collide with}} enemies. The elevation of an enemy {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls toward the bottom of the screen, which a player can collect for points. An egg that <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> platform long enough will hatch into a new knight; if the player does not pick him up, he will gain a new mount and must be defeated again.|$|E

5|$|Soil {{cover in}} the city region is {{predominantly}} sandy due to its proximity to the sea. In the suburbs, the soil cover is largely alluvial and loamy. The underlying rock of the region is composed of black Deccan basalt flows, and their acidic and basic variants {{dating back to the}} late Cretaceous and early Eocene eras. Mumbai <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> seismically active zone owing to the presence of 23 fault lines in the vicinity. The area is classified as a Seismic Zone III region, which means an earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale may be expected.|$|E
5|$|The Child has curly {{blond hair}} and <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> white cloth, {{animated}} and upright, {{at the side of}} the Virgin's lap. Like Mary, his body is shown frontally, his head in three quarters view. He reaches for what seems to be a parrot perched on her lap. At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this overpaint was removed during a late 20th-century restoration. He is intended to represent both the host and Eucharist, common allusions in Early Netherlandish art and reflecting that the panel was intended for the celebration of mass.|$|E
5|$|The {{relief is}} in a {{dilapidated}} condition {{with most of}} the arms and legs broken. He is seated in padmasana lost in his meditation. His posture is well formed and suggests that the 6th century artist knew this asana. He <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lotus with a stalk shown as if coming out of the earth, his legs are crossed symmetrically. Two Nagas flank the lotus and express their reverence with a namaste posture. The great yogi is being approached by various Vedic and Puranic gods and goddesses, as well as monks and sadhus, yet there is a halo around him that keeps them at bay, as if they admire it but do not wish to disturb his meditation.|$|E

5|$|The sheep {{industry}} in Spain was {{an instance of}} migratory flock management, with large homogenous flocks ranging over the entire country. The management model used in England was quite different but had a similar importance to economy of the country. Up until the early 20th century, owling (the smuggling of sheep or wool out of the country) was a punishable offense, {{and to this day}} the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cushion known as the Woolsack.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E
5|$|Hope shows {{its central}} {{character}} alone, {{with no other}} human figures visible and without her traditional fellow virtues, Love (also known as Charity) and Faith. She is dressed in classical costume, based on the Elgin Marbles; Nicholas Tromans of Kingston University speculated that her Greek style of clothing was intentionally chosen to evoke the ambivalent nature of hope in Greek mythology over the certainties of Christian tradition. Her pose is based on that of Michelangelo's Night, in an intentionally strained position. She <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> small, imperfect orange globe with wisps of cloud around its circumference, against an almost blank mottled blue background. The figure is illuminated faintly from behind, as if by starlight, and also directly from the front as if the observer {{is the source of}} light. Watts's use of light and tone avoids the clear definition of shapes, creating a shimmering and dissolving effect more typically associated with pastel work than with oil painting.|$|E

5|$|Jesus sits in {{judgement}} in {{the upper}} centre panel. He holds a lily {{in his right hand}} and a sword in his left, and <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rainbow extending across two panels, while his feet rest on a sphere. His right hand is raised in the act of blessing, his left hand lowered. These positions indicate the act of judgement; he is deciding if souls are to be sent to Heaven or Hell, his gestures echoing the direction and positioning of the scales held by the Archangel Michael beneath him. His palms are open, revealing the wounds sustained when they were nailed to the cross, while his cope gapes in places making visible the injury caused by the lance, which pours deep-red blood. Christ's face is identical to the representation in van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, completed just a few years later in 1452. Christ, placed so high in the pictorial space and spanning both registers, orchestrates the entirety of the inner panels. Whereas earlier Last Judgements might have seemed chaotic, here Christ brings a sense of order.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the crow, a carrier of death, in her iconography {{as well as her}} textual description of having crow-like features associate her with death and inauspiciousness. Another motif in her iconography linking her with death is the {{presence of}} a cremation ground and cremation pyres in the background. Her thousand name hymn says that she lives in the cremation ground, <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> corpse, wears ashes, and blesses those who haunt the grounds. The Prapancasarasara-samgraha relates that she wears a dress taken from a corpse. Dhumavati is the embodiment of tamas guna, associated with ignorance and darkness. She likes meat and wine, both tamasic in nature. The Pranatosinitantra associates her with tamas, when classifying the mahavidyas based on guna.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of red nail polish {{dripping}} from a bottle. It then cuts to Buchanan, who is lying and tapping her foot against the floor. She begins to start feeling her body. In the next scene, Range is seen {{standing in front of}} a mirror with a red lollipop, where she later begins to dance against the sink. Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they have their hands against the walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a hand dryer, which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. Following this, Range <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> couch and uses the nail polish to colour her nails. The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively. The final scene shows the group in front of the cubicles where they begin dancing robotically.|$|E
