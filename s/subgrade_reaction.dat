2500|$|The bearing {{capacity}} of soil {{is the average}} contact stress between a foundation and the soil which will cause shear failure in the soil. [...] Allowable bearing stress is the {{bearing capacity}} divided {{by a factor of}} safety. [...] Sometimes, on soft soil sites, large settlements may occur under loaded foundations without actual shear failure occurring; in such cases, the allowable bearing stress is determined with regard to the maximum allowable settlement. It is important during construction and design stage of a project to evaluate the subgrade strength. The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test is commonly used to determine the suitability of a soil as a subgrade for design and construction. The field Plate Load Test is commonly used to predict the deformations and failure characteristics of the soil/subgrade and modulus of <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> (ks).

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Carbonate cementation is a natural phenomenon. Constant fluctuation of the chemical conditions in the nature causes calcium carbonate to dissolve and reprecipitate as a cementing agent. Research showed that this natural tendency of carbonate cementation can be enhanced by adding lime to the system. Lime is used in many places and especially in Texas to stabilize base and subgrade materials. Base course aggregates are normally stabilized with very low percentage of lime. While pozzolanic reaction is expected to occur in heavily stabilized <b>subgrade,</b> carbonation <b>reaction</b> is likely to be prominent in base courses stabilized with low percentage of lime because of little or no clay in them. In this research, two base course materials commonly used in South Texas, limestone and caliche soil, were tested extensively to examine the effect of carbonate cementation due to the addition of small percentages of lime. Testing included mineralogical analysis of the two materials, strength analysis in terms of texas triaxial strength, atterberg limit testing, scanning electron microscopy examinations, resilient moduli determination of the materials in the lab and in the field. Caliche and limestone base materials stabilized with either I or 2 percent hydrated lime were compared to control (unstabilized) materials in terms of the anal yses 1 i sted above. In addition, Falling Weight Defectometer was used to back calculate moduli values of the pavement layers using the program MODULUS. Mineralogical analysis revealed that quartz-rich limestone and caliche aggregate contained little, if any, clay minerals and it was unlikely for these aggregates to experience pozzolanic reaction for that reason. Strength increases due to the addition of low percentage of lime to both of these aggregates which were observed in Texas triaxial compression tests were most likely {{to be the result of}} carbonation reaction. Laboratory and field testing for resilient moduli also demonstrated that the addition of hydrated lime increased the moduli values of the aggregate regardless of material type, curing time, and moisture condition...|$|R

Equivalent modulus of <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> (k’) {{can be used}} in designing of nailed-slab system. This modular is the cumulative of modulus of <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> from plate load test (k) and additional modulus of <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> due to pile installing (∆k). A recent method has used reduction of pile resistance approach in determining ∆k. The relative displacement between pile and soils, and reduction of pile resistance has been identified. In fact, determining of reduction of pile resistance is difficult. This paper proposes an approach by considering tolerable settlement of rigid pavement. Validation is carried out with respect to a loading test of nailed-slab models. The models are presented as strip section of rigid pavement. The theory of beams on elastic foundation is used to calculate the slab deflection by using k’. Proposed approach can results in deflection prediction close to observed one. In practice, the Nailed-slab System would be constructed by multiple-row piles. Designing this system based on one-pile row analysis will give more safety design and will consume less time.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of the modulus of <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> in statically indeterminate framed structures. In building's design the interaction between ground and foundation can be modelled variously: using springs instead of supports, modelling the wholesale soil as finite elements, etc. The most common situation in practice is that the interaction is modelled using the springs. Nevertheless,there is not just one approved method to calculate it, and engineers use different methods, proposed by various authors. In practice the settlements of foundations are usually calculated and compared with the limit value. However, in some cases the impact of settlements is not taken into account on the analysis of the structure. During the design process, the number of boreholes is always limited. Therefore, the real situation cannot be considered exactly. As a result, unforeseen settlements may cause the considerable redistribution of internal forces, leading to the cracking or even to the failure of the structure. In this research, different calculation methods of modulus of <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> are presented. Most of these methods are adopted for the base of foundations consisted of one soil layer. Therefore, an evaluation proposal of the modulus of <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> for multi-layered soils, using the reviewed methods, is suggested.

40|$|Dynamic Soil-Structure Interaction (DSSI) {{is an area}} of much ongoing {{research}} and has wide and varied applications from seismic response analysis to offshore wind foundation response. DSSI covers a wide range of load regimes from small-strain vibrations to large-strain cyclic loading. One of the most common ways to model DSSI uses the Winkler model, which considers the soil as a series of mutually independent springs. The difficulty with modelling DSSI arises with the inelastic and nonlinear load–displacement response of soil with increasing strain, therefore modelling of large-strain DSSI relies on the specification of many interrelated parameters. The relative magnitude of these parameters can {{have a significant effect on}} the modelled response. In this paper, the specification of an initial stiffness coefficient to model the elastic (small-strain) response of a soil–pile system is investigated. The coefficient of <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> method can be used to generate spring stiffness moduli for Winkler type models. A number of <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> theories have been proposed and their application to the problem of static loading has been widely studied.

40|$|In {{the paper}} the author {{presents}} the results of calculations of the system «structurefoundation-base» in case of using the two-layer and the single-layer beam models on an elastic basis with variable and constant coefficients of <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction.</b> The analytical solution is obtained using the method of initial parameters. The calculations are carried out in case of building up the structure. The method of calculating two-layer beam with variable flexural rigidity along the length on an elastic foundation was described in the author’s previous articles, while in the present paper variable coefficients of <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> are taken into account. A two-layer beam is a beam of variable rigidity, the lower layer simulates the foundation, and the upper — the structure, {{at the same time the}} weight of each layer is considered. For comparison, the problem is also considered in its traditional statement. That means the problem of single-layer beam bending is solved with cross-section of constant length, which is freely lying on an elastic basis of Winkler’s type. The results of calculations of two-layer and single-layer beams show, that the values of the internal forces and stresses are higher with variable coefficient of <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> than with the constant one. When comparing the two-layer and the single-layer beam models with the same foundation characteristics, the values of internal forces in two-layer beams are much higher. On the basis of the calculations we can make the following conclusion: in order to obtain more reliable prognosis of the stress-strain state of the system «structure-foundation» on an elastic basis, it is appropriate to carry out calculations with the use of a contact model in the form of a two-layer beam on an elastic basis of Winkler’s type with variable coefficients of <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction.</b> The model allows us to take account of such factors as rigidity changes in the base and the rigidity of the upper structure.

Additionally {{to the development of a}} non-linear calculation method, further recommendations for practical engineering applications are worked out spezifying the limitations of conventional methods. Also some realistic coefficients depending on the most important influences for linear calculations with the <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> method are given. (orig.)
