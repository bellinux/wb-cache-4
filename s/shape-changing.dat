40|$|On {{the basis}} of studies of radiation-induced <b>shape-change</b> of reactor {{graphite}} GR- 280, through the series of measurements of samples with different orientation of cutting {{with respect to the}} direction of extrusion, a conclusion is made about the existence of polycrystal substructural elements - domains. Domains, like graphite as a whole, possess the property of transverse isotropy, but have different amplitudes of <b>shape-change</b> and random orientations of the axes of axial symmetry. The model of graphite, constructed on {{the basis of}} the concept of domains allowed to explain from a unified point of view most of existing experimental data. It is shown that the presence of the disoriented domain structure leads to the development of radiation-induced stresses and to the dependence of the <b>shape-change</b> on the size of graphite samples. We derive the relation between the <b>shape-change</b> of finite size samples and the actual <b>shape-change</b> of macro-graphite. Comment: 26 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|During {{the early}} blastula period of {{zebrafish}} embryos, the outermost blastomeres begin {{to undergo a}} significant thinning in the apical/basolateral dimension to form the first distinct cellular domain of the embryo, the enveloping layer (EVL). During this shape transformation, only the EVL-precursor cells generate a coincidental series of highly restricted Ca(2 +) transients. To investigate the role of these localized Ca(2 +) transients in this <b>shape-change</b> process, embryos were treated with a Ca(2 +) chelator (5, 5 '-difluoro BAPTA AM; DFB), or the Ca(2 +) ionophore (A 23187), to downregulate and upregulate the transients, respectively, while the <b>shape-change</b> of the forming EVL cells was measured. DFB was shown to significantly slow, and A 23187 to significantly facilitate the shape change of the forming EVL cells. In addition, to investigate the possible involvement of the phosphoinositide and Wnt/Ca(2 +) signaling pathways in the Ca(2 +) transient generation and/or <b>shape-change</b> processes, embryos were treated with antagonists (thapsigargin, 2 -APB and U 73122) or an agonist (Wnt- 5 A) of these pathways. Wnt- 5 A upregulated the EVL-restricted Ca(2 +) transients and facilitated the change in shape of the EVL cells, while 2 -APB downregulated the Ca(2 +) transients and significantly slowed the cell <b>shape-change</b> process. Furthermore, thapsigargin and U 73122 also both inhibited the EVL cell <b>shape-change.</b> We hypothesize, therefore, that the highly localized and coincidental Ca(2 +) transients play a necessary role in initiating the <b>shape-change</b> of the EVL cells...|$|R

Thrombin raised [Ca 2 +]i to 3 μM fast enough for the Ca 2 + to have triggered the cell activation. However, thrombin released more 5 -HT than ionomycin could, and in Ca 2 +-free medium thrombin evoked <b>shape-change</b> and secretion even when [Ca 2 +]i remained near basal levels throughout, suggesting the existence of alternative triggers for <b>shape-change</b> and secretory exocytosis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we study some issues {{relating}} to the general problem of locomotion by <b>shape-changes</b> in a perfect fluid. Our results are two fold. First we introduce a rigorous model for a weighted self-propelled swimming body- one specificity of this model being {{that the number of}} the body’s deformations degrees of freedom is infinite. The dynamic of the coupled system fluid-body is driven by the so-called Euler-Lagrange equations: a system of ODEs allowing us to compute the rigid motion of the body with respect to its prescribed <b>shape-changes.</b> Second, we prove controllability results for this model using powerful tools of geometric control theory. For instance, we show that the body can follow (approximately) any prescribed trajectory while undergoing (approximately) any prescribed <b>shape-changes</b> (this surprising phenomenon will be called Moonwalking). Most of our theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations. I...|$|R

The Active Contour Model tracks the boundary of an object as it changes shape and can also predict how the object might change shape. The method presented here computes <b>shape-change</b> - especially when it {{is in the form of}} growth - better than techniques like optical flow, deformable templates, etc. The specimen data is segmented and an initial guess of the boundary is made by interpolating a set of control points with a cubic polynomial. The boundary of the specimen is then localized by minimizing the energy of the cubic in each image of a sequence. Thus the object's contour is characterized with a small number of points.

40|$|Recent {{work has}} shown that when an {{immersed}} body suddenly changes its size, such as a deflating octopus during rapid escape jetting, the body experiences large forces due to the variation of added-mass energy. We extend this line of research by investigating a spring-mass oscillator submerged in quiescent fluid subject to periodic changes in its volume. This system isolates {{the ability of the}} added-mass thrust to cancel the bluff body resistance (having no jet flow to confuse the analysis) and moves closer to studying how these effects would work in a sustained propulsion case by studying periodic <b>shape-change</b> instead of a "one-shot" escape maneuver. With a combination of analytical, numerical, and experimental results, we show that the recovery of added-mass kinetic energy can be used to completely cancel the drag of the fluid, driving the onset of sustained oscillations with amplitudes as large as four times the average body radius. Moreover, these results are fairly independent of the details of the <b>shape-change</b> kinematics as long as the Stokes number and <b>shape-change</b> number are large. In addition, the effective pumping frequency range based on parametric oscillator analysis is shown to predict large amplitude response region observed in the numerics and experiments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The ATRON {{self-reconfigurable}} robot {{consists of}} simple one {{degree of freedom}} ATRON modules. The motion capabilities of an individual module are therefore quite limited. To compensate for this, meta-modules composed {{of more than one}} module are used to <b>shape-change</b> the system. Meta-modules emerge from the environment created by other modules, move on the surface of other modules and stop at a new position. The flow of meta-modules, {{from one place to another}} on the structure of modules, realizes the desired self-reconfiguration. In this paper we compare six different meta-module types composed of ATRON modules. Variations of meta-module morphology and meta-actions are investigated for its ability to shapechange the robot. We conclude that two of the investigated meta-module types are able to <b>shape-change</b> the robot to an acceptable extent. I...|$|R
40|$|A {{remarkable}} cell shape {{change was}} observed in Bacillus subtilis strain 168 under microculture conditions on CI agar medium (Spizizen’s minimal medium supplemented with a trace amount of yeast extract and Casamino acids). Cells cultured under a cover glass changed in form from rod-shaped to spherical, large and irregular shapes that closely resembled L-form cells. The cell shape change was observed only with CI medium, not with Spizizen’s minimum medium alone or other rich media. The whole-cell protein profile of cells grown under cover glass and cells grown on CI agar plates differed in several respects. Tandem mass analysis of nine gel bands which differed in protein expression between the two conditions showed that proteins related to nitrate respiration and fermentation were expressed in the <b>shape-changed</b> cells grown under cover glass.

This thesis focuses on testing the feasibility of a shape-memory polymer to function as the skin of a morphing aircraft undergoing the wing-sweep method of wing <b>shape-change.</b> A review of literature is presented, giving a brief history of shape-memory polymers, an overview of current significant shape-memory polymer application, an overview of current morphing aircraft in morphing application and an overview of the current methods to activate shape-memory polymers. Analytical and finite element models are created to predict out-of-plane deformations caused by aerodynamic loads on an independently functioning sub-section of a tile array that would comprise the skin of a morphing aircraft. Five generations of a shape-memory polymer tile sub-section with embedded fibers are described and subsequently tested to confirm analytical and finite element models.
