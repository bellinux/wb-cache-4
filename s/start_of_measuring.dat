40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the performance of young calves early weaned off milk replacer and fed on starter concentrates containing 0 % to 100 % lupins. Thirty male Friesian calves aged up to one week old were involved in the experiment. Due to the outbreak of scours, 4 calves died prior to the actual <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> at week 4. The rest were allocated at random based on stratified liveweight to 4 treatment diets containing 0, 33, 67 and 100 % steamed-flaked lupins fed ad libitum during 28 days of period 1 (preweaning) and 35 days of period 2 (post-weaning). Calves fed 100 % lupins completely lost appetite and grew slowly after 6 weeks of receiving experimental diet although the reason for that was not fully elucidated. However, including lupins up to 67 % in diets of young calves did not affect the health status, feed intakes, feed efficiency and growth rates (P> 0. 05). Calves fed diets containing 0, 33, and 67 % lupins consumed about 2. 5 kg DM/day and grew at approximately 1 kg/day with feed conversion ratios of approximately 2. 5 kgDM/kg liveweight gain during the post-weaning period. Plasma and ruminal metabolic measurements were fairly uniform (P> 0. 05) for these calves indicating they had similar degrees of ruminal development and fermentation. Digestibility of DM, N and NDF decreased (P 0. 05) difference among treatment diets. The result indicated that steamed-flaked lupins can be satisfactorily included up to 67 % in calf starter rations without adverse effect on calf performance. Including lupins at these levels helped cut the feed cost per unit gain weight by 10 % compared with using 100 % commercial calf pellets.

This is precisely what Edith Stein, bitterly aware that the German bishops were allowing themselves to be deceived, demanded of Pius XI in her now widely publicized letter of early April 1933." [...] The timing of the letter coincides with the period when Hitler was trying to convince the bishops of his good will towards the Roman Catholic Church in order to obtain a Concordat which both sides signed in July 1933.Stein's letter received no answer, and it is not known for sure whether Pius XI even read it. This until her letter to Pope Pius XI and related correspondence were finally released from Vatican archives. William Doino explains that there was an answer to Stein by Cardinal Pacelli but the letter was sent to Stein’s abbot, Raphael Walzer, because it was he who had mailed Stein's letter to the Vatican (following protocol the letter was not sent to Pius XI directly, but first given to Archabbot Raphael Walzer with a request that he forward it to the Vatican.) Cardinal Pacelli sent then what Doino call a [...] "warm and supportive reply" [...] but speculates that it may never have been received due to Nazi war time surveillance. Pacelli's reply states [...] "I leave it to you to inform the sender Stein in an opportune way that her letter has been dutifully presented to His Holiness Pius XI." ...|$|R
40|$|Paratuberculosis is an {{infectious}} gastrointestinal disease of cattle worldwide [1, 2]. Caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) [3], {{it can lead}} to emaciation, profuse diarrhoea, decreased milk production, and early culling of animals [4]. Several measures are available to control Map spread: to improve calf rearing, to separate as soon as possible calves from their dam, and to cull quickly high shedders [5, 6]. However, measure efficiency is not very well established and might depend on the prevalence of infection in the herd at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>measure</b> implementation. Our objective was to determine which control measures and which minimal level of implementation were needed to avoid degrading prevalence of infected adults within dairy cattle herds according to the <b>starting</b> adult prevalence <b>of</b> infection. We evaluated three situations with contrasted levels of prevalence representing realistic ranges observed in dairy cattle herds in Brittany (France). We developed an original individual-based model of Map spread within a dairy cattle herd, and use this model to assess the effect <b>of</b> control <b>measures</b> on adult prevalence variations. We considered 388 strategies based mostly on reducing exposure of young animals to adult environment and on test-and-cull measures. The model includes 6 age groups (from new-borns to adults), 6 health states (susceptible, no more susceptible, transiently infectious, latently infected, moderately infectious, and highly infectious), and all of the described transmission routes (in utero, faecal-oral, milk and colostrum ingestion). The individual-based paradigm allows following the evolution of animal characteristics over time, and thus to evaluate precise test-and-cull measures with the model. We demonstrated that, irrespective of the initial adult prevalence, both control measures should be combined to avoid degrading adult prevalence in dairy cattle herds. Reducing calf exposure to adult environment was the most important lever to reach a higher probability of prevalence maintenance or decrease. For intermediate prevalence (from 7 % to 21 %), we showed that it was difficult to avoid degrading prevalence even with a high level implementation <b>of</b> control <b>measures,</b> this probability ranging from 25 % to 50 % after 5 years of control implementation. Our results showed that combining control measures is required to avoid degrading the prevalence of infected adults in dairy cattle herds, but that similar options are relevant irrespective of the prevalence at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> control implementation. This result will simplify advices to be provided by Animal Health Services to farmers to help controlling Map spread at local scale...|$|R

Design: A multiple baseline design across 6 subjects was used, with each subject performing 40 repetitions of reaching to grasp a jar. Two subjects each performed 10, 15, or 20 randomly assigned baseline repetitions. Setting: Physiotherapy department or at the participant's home. Participants: Participants with middle cerebral artery or parietal stroke (n= 6) were consecutively recruited from physiotherapy departments. Additional inclusion criteria were a Rivermead Motor Assessment score of 5 or more and time between <b>start</b> <b>of</b> hand opening and transport of more than 60 ms. Interventions: During the intervention phase, feedback on time between <b>start</b> <b>of</b> transport and <b>start</b> <b>of</b> grasp was communicated via GRASP. Participants were encouraged to reduce the time. Main Outcome Measure: The outcome measure was the time between <b>start</b> <b>of</b> transport and <b>start</b> <b>of</b> grasp, <b>measured</b> with GRASP. Results: All participants decreased the mean time lag during the intervention phase compared with the baseline phase.

40|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} the world’s {{population}} that is at risk to malaria lives in India. Plasmodium falciparum, a deadly form of malaria, accounts for about 50 % {{percent of the cases}} there. Since 1940 s India has used a number of programmes to combat the disease with variable success. Since 1998 the total numbers of malaria cases, and in particular P. falciparum cases, have been steadily declining, making India one of the success stories among the countries supported by the Roll Back Malaria Partnership (RBM). This article considers India’s P. falciparum control methods {{from the perspective of a}} Ross-MacDonald type model.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the relative}} performance and selection behaviour of not-for-profit (NFP) job training service providers, using contract {{data from the}} Dutch social benefit administration. Our analysis takes full account of selection effects, both ex ante (before the contracting process) as well as ex post (at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the program). First, for each cohort type of unemployed clients, cohorts that are contracted are ex ante equivalent for providers that are procured. Thus, within cohort type variation in performance outcomes suffices to obtain consistent estimates of performance differentials. Second, ex post selection of clients by providers, at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> programs, is <b>measured</b> explicitly in our data. Our estimation results show that FPs are more active in selecting clients, both by sending back more of them, and indirectly, by encouraging clients to start a program, so as to receive additional (fixed) payments by the social benefit administration (per client at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> a program). Regarding the estimation results for the job placement rates, we find NFP job training service providers only to outperform FPs slightly in the durability of job contracts. This effect is however too small to lead to overall better placement rates. ...|$|R

Methodology/approach – A literature study, with Lean implementation, measuring starting points for improvement work, soft values and the effects of the improvement work in focus has been carried out. Documents from the planned Lean implementation within a municipal division have been studied. To measure the conditions for the implementation a previously conducted measurement approach that measured health-related Quality Management was used. Findings – The paper contains an argument for the importance <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> the effect <b>of</b> a Lean implementation with a focus on soft values and measuring starting points. A description of one planned Lean implementation within a municipal division and their starting conditions are presented. Practical implications – To measure the conditions at the <b>starting</b> point <b>of</b> a Lean implementation gives managers information to help them focus on important improvement areas. A description of a Lean implementation can help other organizations to plan their implementation...|$|R
