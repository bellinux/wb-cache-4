50|$|Homeyer was a {{founding}} member of the German Ornithological Society and from 1876 to 1883 their president. On his death his collection of 20,000 bird specimens was given to the Braunschweig Natural History Museum. Eugen von Homeyer wrote over 150 articles on birds and was the first describer of the <b>semi-collared</b> <b>flycatcher</b> and the Cyprus wheatear. His nephew Alexander von Homeyer was also an ornithologist.|$|E
50|$|Strandzha is {{situated}} on Via Pontica, the second-largest bird migratory route in Europe. The bays and estuaries along the Black Sea coast are a wintering destination for some birds. There are 269 avian {{species in the}} park, including populations of global importance of white-backed woodpecker, <b>semi-collared</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> olive-tree warbler and sombre tit, as well as populations of European importance of Egyptian vulture, white stork, black stork, Eurasian eagle owl and four eagle species.There are 24 species of reptiles, 11 of which have a population of global significance. They include red whip snake, Aesculapian snake, European blind snake, sheltopusik (Europe's largest lizard), Kotschy's gecko, European pond turtle, Balkan pond turtle, spur-thighed tortoise, Hermann's tortoise, etc. The sand lizard, which is typical for western Bulgaria but very uncommon to the east, is also present in the park. Ten amphibian species have been recorded, such as European tree frog, eastern spadefoot and southern crested newt. The absence of common reptiles and amphibians, such as fire salamander, common spadefoot and common European viper, is noteworthy.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Semi-collared</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Ficedula semitorquata) is {{a member}} of the {{black-and-white}} flycatcher species complex. It is poorly studied, rare, and is currently classified as “near threatened”, in the IUCN red lists of threatened species. The <b>Semi-collared</b> <b>flycatcher</b> has a patchy distribution in Europe and part of the Middle East. In this study, I analyzed sequence variation at nuclear loci of Semi-collared flycatchers, and compared the patterns found with those of three other black-and-white flycatcher species, the Pied (F. hypoleuca), Collared (F. albicollis) and Atlas flycatchers (F. speculigera). Genetic variation was found to be relatively high, compared to the other three flycatcher species and there were no signs of inbreeding. All four flycatcher species had less variation at Z-linked loci compared to autosomal loci. A comparison showed that all species combinations had fewer shared polymorphisms and more fixed substitutions at Z-linked than at autosomal loci. Selective sweeps on the Z-chromosome during the evolutionary history of these species is likely to have contributed to this pattern. A mismatch distribution showed signs of a recent population expansion in all four species, and a phylogenetic reconstruction confirmed a relatively deep split and that each species is monophyletic. This study supports the classification of the <b>Semi-collared</b> <b>flycatcher</b> as a separate species. Even though no signs of a small population size are found here, it is important to keep monitoring this bird, since it has gone through several declines across Europe during the last decades. Much of the decline is probably due to habitat destruction, so it is important to retain old forest in the habitat of the species...|$|E
