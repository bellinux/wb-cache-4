The dusky shark is a large, wide-ranging warm-water shark that has been exploited without limit for its meat, fins, and cartilage, particularly since the late 1970 s (SEDAR 2011 a at 3). As a large shark, averaging 11. 8 feet (3. 6 meters) in length and inhabiting both coastal and pelagic waters, the dusky is particularly susceptible to the commercial fishing and finning that have caused its decline. In fact, experts have identified the substantial increase in fishing pressure as the “single greatest threat to <b>all</b> <b>sharks</b> ” (Baum et al. 2005 at 10, 27 - 29). Fishing pressure, even under the most conservative models, threatens a third of <b>all</b> <b>shark</b> <b>species</b> (Morgan 2010 at 2 - 3), and may have already reduced the dusky shark to “the edge of collapse ” (Romine et al. 2009 at 277).

40|$|In most animals, vision {{plays an}} {{important}} role in detecting prey, predators and conspecifics. The effectiveness of vision in assessing cues such as motion and shape is influenced by the ability of the visual system to detect changes in contrast in both space and time. Understanding the role vision plays in shark behaviour has been limited by a lack of knowledge about their temporal resolution, contrast sensitivity and spatial resolution. In this study, an electrophysiological approach was used to compare these measures across five species of sharks: Chiloscyllium punctatum, Heterodontus portusjacksoni, Hemiscyllium ocellatum, Mustelus mustelus and Haploblepharus edwardsii. <b>All</b> <b>shark</b> <b>species</b> were highly sensitive to brightness contrast and were able to detect contrast differences as low as 1. 6 %. Temporal resolution of flickering stimuli ranged from 28 to 44 Hz. Species that inhabit brighter environments were found to have higher temporal resolution. Spatial resolving power was estimated in C. punctatum, H. portusjacksoni and H. ocellatum and ranged from 0. 10 to 0. 35 cycles per degree, which is relatively low compared to other vertebrates. These results suggest that sharks have retinal adaptations that enhance contrast sensitivity at the expense of temporal and spatial resolution, which is beneficial for vision in dimly lit and/or low contrast aquatic environments. 14 page(s...|$|R

Moreover, some areas with low to moderate species richness such as Southern Australia, Angola, North Chile and Western Continental Europe stood out as places of high functional diversity. Finally, species affected by shark finning showed different patterns of diversity, with peaks closer to the Equator and a more oceanic distribution overall. Our results show that the global pattern of shark diversity is uniquely different from land, and other well-studied marine taxa, and may provide guidance for spatial approaches to shark conservation. However, similar to terrestrial ecosystems, protected areas based on hotspots of diversity and endemism alone would provide insufficient means for safeguarding the diverse functional roles that sharks play in marine ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —The {{survival}} rate of juvenile lemon sharks Negaprion brevirostris in North Sound, Bimini, Bahamas, was estimated by marking {{a cohort of}} small sharks (# 53 cm precaudal length) each spring from 1995 to 1999 and by estimating the number of survivors 1 year later by using a depletion method on the marked population. Annual {{survival rate}} estimates varied between 38 % and 65 %, which was somewhat higher than the 39 % steady-state survival predicted from a life cycle (Leslie matrix) model. These are the first direct estimates of the survival rate of a juvenile elasmobranch, and the results support modeling efforts {{that have been used}} in determining limits to sustainable exploitation of elasmobranchs. Estimates of survival rates {{in the present study were}} negatively correlated with estimated initial abundance and are consistent with strong, density-dependent survival. As a group, sharks are generally characterized as having slow growth, late maturity, low fecun-dity, low natural mortality, and long lifespan rel-ative to teleost fishes.

To help identify potential shark predators in speci®c locations, available data on interactions with odontocetes for <b>all</b> <b>shark</b> <b>species</b> that may include cetaceans in their diet are reviewed.

40|$|Organohalogenated {{compounds}} are {{widespread in}} the marine environment and can be {{a serious threat to}} organisms in all levels of aquatic food webs, including elasmobranch species. Information about the concentrations of POPs (persistent organic pollutants) and of MeO-PBDEs (methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers) in elasmobranchs is scarce and potential toxic effects are poorly understood. The aims of the present study were therefore to investigate the occurrence of multiple POP classes (PCBs, PBDEs, DDXs, HCB, CHLs) and of MeO-PBDEs in various elasmobranch species from different trophic levels in estuarine and marine waters of the southeastern United States. Overall, levels and patterns of PCBs, PBDEs, DDXs, HCB, CHLs and of MeO-PBDEs varied according to the species, maturity stage, gender and habitat type. The lowest levels of POPs were found in Atlantic stingrays and the highest levels were found in bull sharks. As both species are respectively near the bottom and at top of the trophic web, with juvenile bull sharks frequently feeding on Atlantic stingrays, these findings further suggest a bioaccumulation and biomagnification process with trophic position. MeO-PBDEs were not detected in Atlantic stingrays, but were found in <b>all</b> <b>shark</b> <b>species.</b> HCB was not found in Atlantic stingrays, bonnetheads or lemon sharks, but was detected in the majority of bull sharks examined.

Dry matter, ash, protein, fat, glycogen, non-protein nitrogen, amino acid profile and calorific value of processed fins were studied. Significantly higher (pC 0. 05) processed fin yield (17. 6 %) was recorded by hammerhead shark compared to the other four species used in this study.

A 4950  mm total length (TL) gravid female accidentally caught by fishermen in the Okinawa Prefecture, Southern Japan carried six embryos (543 - 624  mm TL, three in each uterus). Both uteri contained copious amounts of yellowish viscous uterine fluid (over 79. 2 litres in the left uterus), nutrient eggs and broken egg cases. The embryos had yolk stomachs that had ruptured, the mean volume of which was approximately 197. 9  ml. Embryos had about 20 rows of potentially functional teeth in {{the upper and lower}} jaws. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) -positive substances were observed on the surface and in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells, and large, secretory, OsO 4 -oxidized lipid droplets of various sizes were distributed {{on the surface of the}} villous string epithelium on the uterine wall. Histological examination of the uterine wall showed it to consist of villi, similar to the trophonemata of Dasyatidae rays, suggesting that the large amount of fluid found in the uterus of the white shark was likely required for embryo nutrition. We conclude that: (1) the lipid-rich fluid is secreted from the uterine epithelium only in early gestation before the onset of oophagy, (2) the embryos probably use the abundant uterine fluid and encased nutrient eggs for nutrition at this stage of their development, and (3) the uterine fluid is the major source of embryonic nutrition before oophagy onset.
