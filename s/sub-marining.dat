Here Marianne attempts to renew her courtship with Willoughby, only to find him cold and unresponsive to her advances. When Willoughby leaves Marianne to fend for herself against an attack of giant lobsters, she demands an answer from him, and gets one: she learns that he is engaged to the very wealthy Miss Grey, news which leaves Marianne devastated. She admits to Elinor that she and Willoughby were never officially engaged, but his attentions towards her led her to believe that he loved her and would eventually marry her.|$|R
50|$|Subsea valves {{are used}} to isolate or control the flow of {{material}} through an undersea pipeline (submarine pipeline) or other apparatus. Most commonly used to transport oil and gas, {{they are designed to}} function in a <b>sub-marine</b> environment, withstanding the effects of raised external pressure, salt-water corrosion, and bubbles or debris in the material carried. Subsea valves undergo stringent testing to ensure high reliability.|$|R
40|$|Quantitative geomorphic {{analysis}} of landforms has developed and validated many indices that identify the fingerprints of active tectonics on the topography. Specifically, the Steepness Index (Ks), the Stream Length-Gradient Index (SL) and the Distance-Slope (DS) log-log plots of longitudinal profiles are particularly useful in tectonic Geomorphology to delineate catchment morphology and channel-profile anomalies. Numerous tests {{have demonstrated the}} validity of channel-profile metrics to detect tectonic-generated knickpoints, especially along trunk valleys. In particular, the Ks index demonstrated to be useful in detecting anomalies in catchment morphology and channel-profiles related to active tectonics in both emerged ranges and <b>sub-marine</b> canyons. Recent outcomes from analogous investigations on Martian surface match the findings from catchments on Earth. Further researches, however, are needed {{to better understand the}} sensitivity of the single parameters in detecting tectonic-generated knickpoints in different geodynamic and physiographic settings. Additional investigations are also necessary to verify the validity of the channel metrics regardless of specific typology of flows, for example along debris-flow dominated channels, submarine canyons, and drainage systems on Mars that do not belong to the typical fluvial systems. Accordingly, our research focuses on the calculation and evaluation of Ks, DS, and SL indices, derived from Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), within different test areas from emerged and <b>sub-marine</b> zones on Earth and analogues from Mars. Preliminary results obtained within the Adriatic piedmont area of Apennines (Italy) and a <b>sub-marine</b> canyon system at the Makran margin (Iran), as well as findings from Mars, emphasize the capability of channel-profiles metrics to detect the long-wavelength effects of regional tectonic structures regardless of style and rate of deformation, as well as regardless of processes that act along the present channels...|$|R

30|$|Voltage source {{converter}} (VSC) {{high voltage}} DC (HVDC) connection {{has become a}} new trend for long distance offshore wind power transmission. Power transmission of an offshore wind power plant (WPP) is conventionally done via high voltage AC (HVAC) <b>sub-marine</b> cables. It has been confirmed by {{quite a lot of}} research that the maximum transmission distance of a HVAC <b>sub-marine</b> cable transmission system is limited, especially due to surplus charging current of the cables [1, 2]. The VSC HVDC transmission system has the ability to overcome these limitations and offers other advantages over the HVAC transmission system [3, 4, 5, 6]. The choice between a HVAC and a HVDC transmission system depends upon many factors such as total energy losses, system cost, required system services, power control-ability, etc. It is generally more efficient to transport power over a HVDC line for high power and long distances (larger than 100  km). A common technique for long distance power transmission is to utilize a mixed AC/DC system with a medium voltage AC (MVAC) collector network at the WPP and a HVDC transmission line.|$|R
