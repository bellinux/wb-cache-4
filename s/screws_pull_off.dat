50|$|Upon {{his return}} in the first tournament of 2011 he had fallen to makushita #51.

In many ways, this would mirror sekitori Toyonoshima's feat in previous months of bouncing back from a demotion to jūryō for baseball gambling by <b>pulling</b> <b>off</b> a championship in that tournament and almost <b>pulling</b> <b>off</b> a makuuchi championship in a playoff loss to Hakuhō in the following tournament. Matsutani would attain re-entry to jūryō at a career high #3. He only managed a 7-8 record, but in the following September tournament at jūryō #5 would bounce back with a convincing 11-4 winning tournament.|$|R

Wilson then lifted Melina to her shoulders and dropped her to the mat, while she attempted to <b>pull</b> <b>off</b> her pants, but Melina countered the attack by <b>pulling</b> Wilson's pants <b>off</b> to win the match.
