30|$|Field {{observations}} {{showed that}} the landslides on the steep metamorphic terrain have discrete, <b>slickensided</b> shear surfaces. There were rupture surfaces from which movements began as slides and continued for long distances as mudflow/slides. The materials involved were typically poorly-sorted sandy colluviums supported by about 43 % clay matrix produced from the weathering of the rocks. The characteristics the clay matrix probably contributed to the rapid movement and longer travel distance witnessed on the metamorphic terrain. On the sedimentary terrain, slumps and short runout debris slides of limited volume dominate the medium steep landscape. The slow to rapid mostly unsaturated movements usually initiate within the sandy body or on clayey/shale interlayer, but are typically on non-discrete, matrix-poor shear surfaces. The movements are mainly non-confined and without established channel. Generally, {{the size of the}} shallow landslides appeared to depend on soil thickness and saturation. The landslides occurred when soil thickness accumulating at sufficient depth was saturated by rain infiltration.|$|E

Samples were collected either from west block or Petea block. The west block is mostly occupied by unserpentinised peridotite, whereas the east block represented by Petea area is covered by moderately to highly serpentinized protolith.

Nickel content of the garnierite samples studied by means of XRF methods ranges from 1. 8 to 19. 2 wt%.

40|$|Composite soils {{having a}} wide range of {{particle}} size may be the most commonly encountered materials in geotechnical engineering practice. This study involves 21 direct shear tests to investigate the constitutive behavior of composite soils within the normal stress range from 50 to 200 kPa. The samples are mixtures of fine (kaolin) and coarse (glass beads) fractions at various proportions. The properties of the samples considered in the investigation are particle size distribution, water content of sheared specimens, structural features of shear surface and residual shear strength. It is shown that the particle size distribution influences the void ratio produced with the same compaction effort. Increasing fine fraction from zero to a threshold value (approximately 20 – 30 %) causes a decrease in void ratio of the mixture. Beyond this threshold, a further increase of fine fraction causes an increase in void ratio. High proportion of fine fraction causes: (1) lower water content of shear zones relative to outer zones, (2) densification process within shear zone, (3) well <b>slickensided</b> shear surfaces, and (4) shearing in sliding mode and hence low residual shear strength. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Joint systems {{developed}} in the massive Lithonia Gneiss in the Lithonia–Conyers area in eastern Metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia (Fig. 1) may locally influence the flow and movement of groundwater in the underlying crystalline bedrock. In quarries, outcrops, and wells, these fracture systems almost always occur in zones of joint concentration separated by either poorly jointed or unjointed rock. In most parts of this study area, the joints have a fairly consistent orientation (Fig. 2) and, where concentrated, appear to influence drainage patterns. In quarries, groundwater is commonly observed seeping along zones of joint concentration and moving downward into the subsurface; this substantially influences weathering along these zones and, in turn, contributes to valley development. <b>Slickensided</b> joints (small faults) also occur in local quarries; these occur in systems of en-echelon, moderately-dipping fractures that {{may be part of}} larger brittle fault zones.

40|$|Test conditions, such as {{shearing}} rate and normal stress, have been long recognised as influencing the measured shear strength of clays and sands. However, {{their influence on}} composite soils, which have {{a wide range of}} particle sizes, has attracted much less attention from researchers. In this study, a total of 35 direct shear tests at different {{shearing rate}}s under different normal stresses were conducted on specimens prepared by mixing different proportions of kaolin and glass beads. The changes in volume and water content of sheared specimens and the mesostructure of shear surfaces were studied. The results reveal a positive correlation between volume change and deviation of water content between the shear zone and outer zones, suggesting that the shear-induced volume change occurred primarily in the shear zones. Moreover, high normal stress and low shearing rate produced a relatively small void ratio in the shear zones, facilitating volumetric contraction of the specimen and the development of polished and evenly <b>slickensided</b> shear surfaces. In addition, the residual friction angle of the specimens tested was found to decrease with the increase in normal stress. The high shearing rate caused an increase in residual strength in specimens with low fines fraction, and reduced it in specimens with high fines fraction. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. — The stratigraphic position, sedimentologic {{characteristics}} and {{origin of the}} copper deposits of Oligocene (—Mioce-ne?) age are investigated in an area between Delice and Yerköy, on the northern side of Delice river. Copper mineralization is observed mainly in three different stratigraphic positions in the region. The first type is the native copper ore, found in red and gray colored continental sandstones and conglomerate which overlie marine fossiliferous (Middle Eocene) limestones. The second type is the malachite ore, found in Oligocene (—Miocene?) units of the Toprakhk tepe formation which consists of red sandstones, conglomerate and mudstones. This ore is restricted into the fine-grained, gray-colored sandstone and is rich in carbonized plant remains. The third type is the primary native copper and malachite ore found at the upper parts of the Toprakhk tepe formation. While the native copper mineralization is strictly associated with fault zones and <b>slickensided</b> surfaces, the malachite mineraliza-tion occurs {{in the form of}} a cement, binding mostly the aetritic volcanic material. Malachite type mineralization represents point bar and flood plain environmental condition of sedimentation. The local occurrence of malachite ore together with plant remains in gray-colored sandstone of the red-bed series indicates that this type of ore was deposited primarily (probably as a sulfide or native copper or malachite) during the deposition of the host rock material under chemically reducing conditions. On the other hand, the native copper ore is supposedly an epigenetic type and related to the tenaonal and compressional forces. Cuprite and malachite found with native copper was formed secondarily under surface conditions...|$|E

The 84 m of core comprises Miocene-age well-bedded muds, silts, and volcaniclastic sediments. Beds increase in dip with depth, and are cut by (i) soft-sediment deformation bands (“vein structures”), (ii) ? 1 -cm thick shear zones within ? 10 -cm thick regions of high shear strain, and (iii) < 1 -mm thick <b>slickensided</b> faults which are the youngest structures in the core and highly localized. Microstructural analyses of the shear zones suggest that they formed via multiple increments of shear localization and a mixed granular and cataclastic flow. Kinematic analysis of slip indicators in shear zones further reveals that they formed via north–south shortening. In contrast, the faults cut the shear zones with mixed slip kinematics, and accommodated northwest–southeast shortening, roughly parallel to the modern shortening direction. The entire section was also rotated ? 15 ° counterclockwise about a roughly vertical axis. Therefore the principle strain axes and stratigraphic section rotated during or postdating development of the major sub-basin (? 5. 6 – 3. 8 Ma) unconformity, a time that generally coincides with a change in the Philippine Sea plate convergence direction. Forearc basin development therefore postdates a protracted geologic evolution of shear-zone development, tectonic rotations, and inner-wedge development, the last of which coincides with a rheological evolution toward localized frictional faulting...|$|E

The coal-bearing Permian Vryheid Formation of the Ecca Group (Karoo Supergroup) was {{investigated}} at New Denmark Colliery, {{situated in the}} north east section of the Karoo Basin, South Africa. The lithostratigraphy of the sequence is {{defined in terms of}} conventional lithostratigraphic terminology but also by applying detailed genetic stratigraphic schemes that have previously been proposed for the adjacent coalfields. The succession is divided up into depositional sequences named after the underlying and overlying coal seams, the No. 2, 3, 4 and 5 seam sequences. The sedimentary succession was divided up into five facies, namely: conglomerate facies, sandstone facies, interlaminated sandstone-siltstone facies, siltstone facies and coal facies. These were interpreted hydrodynamically. Facies assemblages were then interpreted palaeoenvironmentally. Glacial, fluvial, deltaic and transgressive marine sequences were responsible for forming this sedimentary succession. Attention was then focussed on the main economic No. 4 seam, which is mined underground at the colliery. Detailed subsurface geological cross-sections, core sequences and isopach maps of the No. 4 seam coal and the lithologies above, were used to determine specific aspects of the depositional environment that could contribute to unstable roof conditions above No. 4 seam. Coarsening-upward deltaic cycles, fining-upward bedload fluvial cycles, glauconite sandstone marine transgressions and crevasse-splay deposits are recognized in the overlying strata. Poor roof conditions occur parallel to palaeochannel margins because the interbedded channel sandstone and adjacent flood plain argillites cause collapsing along bedding plane surfaces. Rider coals overlying thin crevasse-splay sequences in close proximity to the No. 4 seam, create {{one of the most serious}} roof conditions; complete collapse occurs along the rider coal contact with the underlying splay deposits. Differential compaction of mudrock/shale/siltstone over more competent sandstone causes <b>slickensided</b> surfaces that weaken the roof lithologies. Correct identification of these sedimentological features will enable the prediction of potential poor roof conditions during mining operations and mine planning...|$|E

40|$|Secondary {{minerals}} filling {{veins and}} vesicles in volcanic basement at Deep Sea Drilling Project Sites 458 and 459 {{indicate that there}} were two stages of alteration at each site: an early oxidative, probably hydrothermal, stage and a later, low-temperature, less oxidative stage, probably contemporaneous with faulting in the tectonically active Mariana forearc region. The initial stage is most evident in Hole 459 B, where low-Al, high Fe smectites and iron hydroxides formed in vesicles in pillow basalts and low-Al palygorskite formed in fractures. Iron hydroxides and celadonite formed in massive basalts next to quartz-oligoclase micrographic intergrowths. Palygorskite was found in only one sample near the top of basement in Hole 458, but it too is associated with iron hydroxides. Palygorskite has previously been reported only in marine sediments in DSDP and other occurrences. It evidently formed here as a precipitate from fluids in which Si, Mg, Fe, and even some Al were concentrated. Experimental data suggest that the solutions probably had high pH and somewhat elevated temperatures. The compositions of associated smectites resemble those in hydrothermal sediments and in basalts at the Galapagos mounds geothermal field. The second stage of alteration was large-scale replacement of basalt by dioctahedral, trioctahedral, or mixed-layer clays and phillipsite along zones of intense fracturing, especially near the bottom of Holes 458 and 459 B. The basalts are commonly <b>slickensided,</b> and there are recemented microfault offsets in overlying sediments. Native copper occurs in one core of Hole 458, but associated smectites are dominantly dioctahedral, unlike Hole 459 B, where they are mainly trioctahedral, indicating nonoxidative alteration. The alteration in both holes is more intense than at most DSDP ocean crust sites and may have been augmented by water derived from subducting ocean crust beneath the fore-arc region...|$|E
40|$|The Main Fault in the shaly facies of Opalinus Clay {{is a small}} {{reverse fault}} formed in {{slightly}} overconsolidated claystone at around 1  km depth. The fault zone is up to 6  m wide, with micron-thick shear zones, calcite and celestite veins, scaly clay and clay gouge. Scaly clay occurs in up to 1. 5  m wide lenses, providing hand specimens for this study. We mapped the scaly clay fabric at 1  m– 10  nm scale, examining scaly clay {{for the first time}} using broad-ion beam polishing combined with scanning electron microscopy (BIB-SEM). Results show a network of thin shear zones and microveins, separating angular to lensoid microlithons between 10  cm and 10  µm in diameter, with <b>slickensided</b> surfaces. Our results show that microlithons are only weakly deformed and that strain is accumulated by fragmentation of microlithons by newly formed shear zones, by shearing in the micron-thick zones and by rearrangement of the microlithons. The scaly clay aggregates can be easily disintegrated into individual microlithons because of the very low tensile strength of the thin shear zones. Analyses of the microlithon size by sieving indicate a power-law distribution model with exponents just above 2. From this, we estimate that only 1  vol % of the scaly clay aggregate is in the shear zones. After a literature review of the hypotheses for scaly clay generation, we present a new model to explain the progressive formation of a self-similar network of anastomosing thin shear zones in a fault relay. The relay provides the necessary boundary conditions for macroscopically continuous deformation. Localization of strain in thin shear zones which are locally dilatant, and precipitation of calcite veins in dilatant shear fractures, evolve into complex microscale re-partitioning of shear, forming new shear zones while the microlithons remain much less deformed internally and the volume proportion of the µm-thick shear zones slowly increases. Grain-scale deformation mechanisms are microfracturing, boudinage and rotation of mica grains, pressure solution of carbonate fossils and pore collapse during ductile flow of the clay matrix.
