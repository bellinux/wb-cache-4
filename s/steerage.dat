5|$|Breslau {{was built}} in 1901 by the Bremer Vulkan yard at Vegesack for the North German Lloyd line as the fourth of seven ships of the Köln class. The Köln-class ships, all named after German cities, were {{designed}} for the Bremen to Baltimore and Galveston route, and were specially fitted for <b>steerage</b> traffic. Though the class was designed with accommodations for 120 cabin-class passengers and up to 1,850 <b>steerage</b> passengers for service from Germany, Breslaus capacity was somewhat lower, with room for 66 cabin-class and 1,660 in <b>steerage.</b> The Köln-class <b>steerage</b> compartments had portholes for better light and ventilation than was typical, and included cabins that housed from four to ten passengers. Köln-class ships were specially designed to carry large freight loads on return voyages to Germany, with holds customized for carrying wheat and cotton.|$|E
5|$|Rochelle Rose as Noël Leslie, Countess of Rothes: The Countess {{is shown}} to be {{friendly}} with Cal and the DeWitt Bukaters. Despite being of a higher status in society than Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon, she is kind, and helps row the boat and even looks after the <b>steerage</b> passengers.|$|E
5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the <b>steerage</b> passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the <b>steerage</b> passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their <b>steerage</b> passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the <b>steerage</b> passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E
5|$|SS Wittekind {{was built}} by Blohm & Voss of Hamburg for North German Lloyd’s Roland Line, which was a {{fortnightly}} <b>steerage</b> and freight service from Bremen to New York. Launched on 3 February 1894, Wittekind—named for Wittekind (c. 730–808), the Duke of Saxony—and sister-ship Willehad were the first twin-screw steamers expressly built for North German Lloyd. The new liner sailed on her maiden voyage to Hoboken, New Jersey on 14 April.|$|E
5|$|The {{third class}} {{passengers}} or <b>steerage</b> passengers left hoping to start new {{lives in the}} United States and Canada. Third class passengers paid £7 (£ today) for their ticket, depending on their place of origin; ticket prices often included the price of rail travel to the three departure ports. Tickets for children cost £3 (£ today).|$|E
5|$|Before all the <b>steerage</b> {{passengers}} {{had even}} {{a chance of}} their lives, the Titanics sailors fastened the doors and companionways leading up from the third-class section... A crowd of men {{was trying to get}} up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they wanted to keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.|$|E
5|$|Kroonland was {{the scene}} of an {{attempted}} murder-suicide in October 1908. Two acquaintances in <b>steerage</b> had an argument over a young female second-class passenger that both men knew. One man threw a knife at the other—only slightly wounding him—and then fled and jumped over the railing into the English Channel near Dover. U.S. Senator Benjamin Tillman and his wife were aboard the liner at the time and saw the young man jump overboard. Although the ship lowered a boat to look for him, no trace of him was found, and he was presumed drowned.|$|E
5|$|Of the season's five {{tropical}} cyclones, {{only one}} reached hurricane status, the fewest since 1890. Furthermore, that storm strengthened into major hurricane, which is Category3 or {{higher on the}} modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. This storm, which was the fourth and strongest hurricane of the season, peaked at Category3 strength with 120mph (195km/h) winds. It was also attributed to at least six fatalities after sending a rogue wave across the <b>steerage</b> of the steamer Campania. The first storm also resulted in two deaths after a schooner wrecked in Barbados.|$|E
5|$|The Titanics {{passengers}} {{were divided into}} three separate classes, determined {{not only by the}} price of their ticket but by wealth and social class: those travelling in first class, most of them the wealthiest passengers on board, included prominent members of the upper class, businessmen, politicians, high-ranking military personnel, industrialists, bankers, entertainers, socialites, and professional athletes. Second class {{passengers were}} middle class travellers and included professors, authors, clergymen, and tourists. Third class or <b>steerage</b> passengers were primarily emigrants moving to the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|During the Crimean War Cunard {{supplied}} 11 ships for war service. Every British North Atlantic route {{was suspended}} until 1856 except Cunard's Liverpool–Halifax–Boston service. While Collins' fortunes improved {{because of the}} lack of competition during the war, it collapsed in 1858 after its subsidy for carrying mail across the Atlantic was reduced by the US Congress. Cunard emerged as the leading carrier of saloon passengers and in 1862 commissioned Scotia, the last paddle steamer to win the Blue Riband. Inman carried more passengers because of its success in the immigrant trade. To compete, in May 1863 Cunard started a secondary Liverpool–New York service with iron-hulled screw steamers that catered for <b>steerage</b> passengers. Beginning with China, the line also replaced the last three wooden paddlers on the New York mail service with iron screw steamers that only carried saloon passengers.|$|E
5|$|Left {{without any}} family, Morales headed for Antofagasta, then a port town in Bolivia that was booming {{due to the}} nitrate mines in the area. She {{travelled}} there as a <b>steerage</b> passenger, with a ticket she bought by selling nearly all of her possessions. While working there, she met Santiago Pizarro, a Chilean in his 30s who made his living in a Bolivian military band, and married him in mid-1878, aged 13. He was tried and executed on 21 September of that year for killing a Bolivian soldier in a drunken brawl. She found his body dumped {{by the side of}} the railway tracks and took a gold ring from his finger, which she wore for the rest of her life. Pizarro's execution was widely protested by the mostly Chilean population of Antofagasta, which resented what was seen as an unjust Bolivian government.|$|E
5|$|Rosenberg left Hawaii on June 7, 1887, booking <b>steerage</b> class {{passage on}} the steamer Australia. Some reports state {{that he left}} owing to health issues, {{although}} others suggest that Rosenberg departed the island because {{he was concerned about}} political unrest. He left three weeks before the king signed the June Constitution. Rosenberg returned to San Francisco, but was hospitalized within a month of his return, and died on July 10, 1887. He spoke of King Kalākaua on his deathbed, whispering the king's name with his dying breath. He was buried at the cemetery of Congregation Sherith Israel in the San Francisco Peninsula; brief death notices were published in Hawaii- and San Francisco-based newspapers.|$|E
5|$|In May 1920 Princess Matoika took {{on board}} the bodies of ten female nurses and over 400soldiers who died while on duty in France during the war. The ship then transited the Kiel Canal and picked up 1,600U.S. {{residents}} of Polish descent at Danzig, {{all of whom had}} enlisted in the Polish Army {{at the outset of the}} war. Also included among the passengers were 500U.S. soldiers who had been released from occupation duty at Koblenz. The ship arrived at New York on 23May with little fanfare and no ceremony; bodies returned but not claimed by families were buried at Arlington National Cemetery. On 21 July, Princess Matoika arrived in New York after a similar voyage with 25war brides, many repatriated Polish troops among its 2,094 <b>steerage</b> passengers, and the remains of 881soldiers. In between these two trips, the Belgian Ambassador to the United States, Baron Emile de Cartier de Marchienne, sailed from New York to Belgium {{on board the}} Matoika. It was, however, Princess Matoikas next trip to Belgium that was the most infamous.|$|E
5|$|Kroonlands lifeboat, {{manned by}} a fresh crew, headed {{back out and}} {{returned}} with 13 <b>steerage</b> passengers. On board Volturno, the crew {{and some of the}} male passengers, unable to extinguish the fire, were at least able to keep it from spreading to the aft cargo holds, over which the others on board were gathered. Shortly before dawn, a large explosion—probably of her boilers—rocked Volturno, and the rescuers felt that the ship, which had not been in imminent danger of sinking up to this point, might founder at any time. The tanker Narragansett turned on her pumps and sprayed lubricating oil on the sea to help calm the surface. The combined effect of the oil and the lessening of the storm allowed many more lifeboats to be sent to Volturnos aid. Kroonland launched two more boats herself and saved 75 more, including Captain Inch, the last person to leave the stricken ship. In all, some 520 passengers and crew were rescued by the ten ships—89 on Kroonland alone. The loss of life was limited to around 130, mostly women and children from the early lifeboat launchings.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} and acceptance by Royal Holland Lloyd, Tubantia {{was used in}} service between Amsterdam and Buenos Aires. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Tubantia was returning from South America with £500,000 in gold destined for banks in London, {{a large portion of}} which was intended for the German Bank of London. She was also carrying about 150 German reservists in <b>steerage</b> and a cargo of grain destined for Germany. After making an intermediate stop in Vigo, Spain, Tubantia was stopped and boarded by an officer and crewmen from the Royal Navy cruiser , and escorted into port at Plymouth. There, the German reservists were taken off Tubantia by Royal Marines; the gold was confiscated and removed from the ship. Although news accounts do not report when it occurred, Tubantia was released from Plymouth and allowed to resume her Royal Holland Lloyd service.|$|E
5|$|With {{the aid of}} a small sum {{of money}} from his distant {{relative}} the Chief Rabbi, Adler got together the money to travel by <b>steerage</b> to New York, with his infant son Abrom, Alexander Oberlander and his family, Keni and Volodya Liptzin, and Herman Fiedler, among others. Adler did not doubt that the rabbi was glad to see Yiddish actors leaving London. In New York, they promptly discovered that neither Mogulesko and Finkel at the Romanian Opera House nor Maurice Heine at the Oriental Theater had any use for them. They headed on to Chicago, where, after a brief initial success, the troupe fell apart due to a combination of labor disputes and cutthroat competition. The Oberlanders managed to start a restaurant; he and Keni Liptzin headed to New York that autumn, where she managed to sign on at the Romanian Opera House; failing to find a similar situation for himself, he returned to London, drawn back to the charms of both Dinah and Jennya.|$|E
25|$|When {{the ship}} became the Maasdam, the liner {{was able to}} {{accommodate}} 150 first class, 60 second class, and 800 <b>steerage</b> passengers. Finally, when {{it was designed to}} transport migrants, it could accommodate 1,424 <b>steerage</b> passengers.|$|E
25|$|The vessel retains <b>steerage</b> way.|$|E
25|$|In June 1895, also on {{its usual}} Sydney-to-Ballina run, a seasick <b>steerage</b> {{passenger}} fell overboard and drowned.|$|E
25|$|<b>Steerage</b> by Canberra {{sculptor}} {{is made of}} Harcourt granite in {{the shape}} of a boat, which points toward the city.|$|E
25|$|The Constellation (1849), {{built for}} the Robert Kermit Red Star Line—1,534tons; 201feet 10inches x 41feet x 28feet (length x beam x depth of hold); 3 decks; draft 23feet. This was the largest sailing vessel in the New York–Liverpool packet service at that time. The Constellation carried between 800 and 900 <b>steerage</b> {{passengers}} per passage on the lower deck (the 912 <b>steerage</b> passengers she discharged on 29 May 1851 was a record at the time).|$|E
25|$|The <b>Steerage</b> dealt {{alternately}} with geometric forms {{constructed in}} spatial planes within a photographic frame {{and issues of}} social class and gender differences.|$|E
25|$|One other {{distraction}} {{could have}} been a reason why Stieglitz did not immediately publish The <b>Steerage.</b> While he was still in Paris on the same trip he saw {{for the first time and}} experimented with the new Autochrome Lumière process, the first commercially viable means of capturing images in color. For the next two years he was captivated by color photography, and he did not return to The <b>Steerage</b> and other black-and-white photos until he learned to photograph using this new process.|$|E
25|$|First class {{passengers}} had {{quarters in}} the midship {{house on the}} bridge and shelter decks with access to a saloon lighted by a skylight and dinging room. Some rooms had private lavatories, but lavatories for men and another for women were located aft of the engine casing on the shelter deck with another set {{in the center of}} the bridge deck accommodations. The upper deck was fitted for either light cargo or <b>steerage</b> passengers and, in the event of Chinese <b>steerage</b> passengers, had provision for a Chinese galley and wash area.|$|E
25|$|In 1915 Stieglitz devoted {{the entire}} No 7-8 issue of 291 to The <b>Steerage.</b> The only {{text in the}} issue were {{comments}} on the photo by Paul Haviland and Marius de Zayas.|$|E
25|$|Length 350'; beam 42'; depth 17'3". Viking had {{accommodation}} for {{a crew of}} 80, and was certificated {{to carry}} 2,000 passengers, saloon accommodation was aft and <b>steerage</b> passengers were carried forward.|$|E
25|$|On 15 December Dollar Lines' President Pierce {{arrived and}} rescued President Hoovers <b>steerage</b> passengers, {{officers}} and remainder of her crew. USS Alden remained guarding the wreck until 23 December, when the Japanese authorities took over.|$|E
25|$|To {{the left}} was an inclining funnel and from the upper <b>steerage</b> deck there was {{fastened}} a gangway bridge that was glistening in its freshly painted state. It was rather long, white, and during the trip remained untouched by anyone.|$|E
25|$|A Boat {{starts from}} the Basin {{at the head}} of the Town , every lawful day, at four o'clock, P.M. (except when impeded by ice,) and arrives at Sheepford at half past six o'clock. Cabin fare, 1s. 6d.; <b>Steerage,</b> 1s.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Steerage</b> is a {{photograph}} taken by Alfred Stieglitz in 1907. It has been hailed {{as one of the}} greatest photographs of all time because it captures in a single image both a formative document of its time and one of the first works of artistic modernism.|$|E
25|$|The 'Princes' {{themselves}} were {{not known for}} their manoeuvrability; heavy and blocky, when forced {{to keep pace with}} a slow convoy and in order to maintain <b>steerage,</b> the ships often ran with the leeward shaft at twice the speed of the other. Despite these extreme conditions, there were surprisingly few mishaps.|$|E
25|$|Reston {{was born}} in Clydebank, Scotland, into a poor, devout Scottish Presbyterian family that emigrated to the United States in 1920. He sailed {{with his mother and}} sister to New York as <b>steerage</b> {{passengers}} on board SS Mobile, and they were inspected at Ellis Island on September 28, 1920.|$|E
25|$|On {{the lower}} deck was a {{servants}} {{dining room and}} a further 82 first-class staterooms. The forward section of this deck was reserved for 730 <b>steerage</b> passengers. This section was a large area of about 150 feet long, and included a dining area. The berths were grouped into separate male and female areas.|$|E
25|$|In 1882 she was {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean, and regularly carried Italian immigrants to the United States. In 1890–1891 she was refitted with a triple expansion steam engine. To maximize revenue on the Italian route, her first class accommodations were reduced to 45 passengers, and second class was removed altogether, thus increasing <b>steerage</b> capacity to 900 bunks.|$|E
25|$|While {{on his way}} to Europe, Stieglitz {{took what}} is {{recognized}} not only as his signature image but also {{as one of the most}} important photographs of the 20th century. Aiming his camera at the lower class passengers in the bow of the ship, he captured a scene he titled The <b>Steerage.</b> He did not publish or exhibit it for four years.|$|E
