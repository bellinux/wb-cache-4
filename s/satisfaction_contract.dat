We explored the relationships between overeducation and job satisfaction (extrinsic, intrinsic, social facet), {{as well as the}} direct and moderating role of salary, contract of employment, and work experience in these relationships using hierarchical regression analyses.

Moreover, high work experience emerged as a moderating factor that buffered the negative effect of overeducation on extrinsic <b>satisfaction.</b> <b>Contract</b> of employment and salary did not moderate these relationships...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. federal {{government}} contracts over five hundred {{billion dollars in}} goods and services each year. Traditionally, these contracts are awarded {{on the basis of}} a combination of a contractor's proposed cost, quality, technical capability and demonstrated past performance. While all valid and important comparators, the overall quality and customer satisfaction achieved at the completion of contracts awarded on these bases remains highly variable from contract-to-contract. This thesis examines potential reasons for the variability of these results and further proposes additional factors for contract evaluation and award that should improve the chances for successful contract outcomes. Twenty four randomly selected and recently completed U. S. Coast Guard construction contracts were used as the basis for study. The documented performance information for each contract was compared against contract demographic information in a search for correlations that are predictive of the likelihood of a high level of contract <b>satisfaction.</b> <b>Contract</b> performance ratings, contract timeliness and contract on-budget performance were compared to overall contractor annual revenue, total contractor employees, the relative contract size and a contractor's revenue per employee. The main finding is that total contractor revenue, relative contract size (higher is better) and contractor revenue per employee (higher is better) are reliable predictors of performance and should be considered as relevant source selection factors for negotiated contracts. Capable small contractors should be selected not simply as a matter of conformance to a social program, but because the expected results are higher. In addition, the following recommendations apply in order to maximize the probability of positive performance outcomes on U. S. Coast Guard construction contracts: 1) Improve the collection and utilization of past performance data. 2) Minimize sealed-low bid contracting. 3) Maximize contracts by negotiation. 4) Maximize the usage of small businesses, above the "micro-small" level. by Dennis C.

Contract driven multi-query processing, being an NP-hard problem, remains unaddressed to date. The traditional approach of blindly pipelining the entire input through a shared execution plan is not viable {{due to the}} diversity in query contracts. To tackle this challenge, we now develop a flexi-ble model to express contracts and accompany it with an effective means to measure the run-time <b>contract</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> We propose our Contract-Aware Query Execution framework CAQE. In this work, we exploit the principle that “different portions of the in-put contribute to disparate subsets of queries {{with varying degrees of}} progressiveness. ” Therefore, CAQE’s processing of the input chunks is driven by how the different query contracts are being met at run-time. To maximize the <b>contract</b> <b>satisfaction</b> of the work-load, CAQE leverages the dependencies of input chunks across the queries. This enables us to determine the impact of processing par-ticular input chunks on improving the run-time contract satisfac-tion.

Static verification techniques have been applied to imperative and object-oriented languages, like Java and C#, for checking basic safety properties such as memory leaks. In a pure functional language, many of these basic properties are guaranteed by design, which suggests the opportunity for verifying more sophisticated program properties. Nevertheless, few automatic systems for doing so exist. In this thesis, we show the challenges and solutions to verifying advanced properties of a pure functional language, Haskell.

A survey was conducted among these employees to measure their attitudes towards pay-for-performance and supporting themes.
