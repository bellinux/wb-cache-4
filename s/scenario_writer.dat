5|$|After {{the project}} was accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main <b>scenario</b> <b>writer</b> Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite. However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on {{the project was}} Romeo Tanaka, who {{she had become a}} fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by Tanaka. While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka decided to take the project when he was given the time he needed to do the job. When he accepted it, Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main <b>scenario</b> <b>writer,</b> and he became more interested when he was told that he would write Rewrites overall story.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the only}} other <b>scenario</b> <b>writer</b> on the project was Yūto Tonokawa of Key, who {{previously}} contributed on Key's sixth game Little Busters!. Tanaka was tasked with drawing up the entire scenario framework, and during this time, Takahiro Baba suggested that one more heroine route {{be added to the}} story to bring the total to six, but to do that they had to hire another writer. Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion, the creators of the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Umineko no Naku Koro ni game franchises, was brought in as the third <b>scenario</b> <b>writer</b> after Baba suggested in late 2007 that Key ask him to join the staff for Rewrite. Ultimately, Tanaka wrote the story leading up to the heroine's routes, Kotori's and Akane's scanarios, the Moon and Terra routes, and the bonus Oppai route. Tonokawa wrote Chihaya's and Sizuru's routes, and Ryukishi07 wrote Lucia's story. Tanaka initially planned on the length of Rewrites story to be on about the same scale as Key's second game Air, but as it increased in size, he later attempted to keep it close to the scale of Little Busters!.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a third-person action-adventure puzzle-platform {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Ubisoft. First revealed in March 2003, it was released across Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox and Microsoft Windows in November 2003. The Sands of Time is a reboot of the Prince of Persia series, created by Jordan Mechner. Mechner served as creative consultant, designer, and <b>scenario</b> <b>writer</b> for The Sands of Time.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Scenarios, which {{constrain}} {{the behavior of}} agents, can be the interface between computer experts (agent system developers) and application designers (<b>scenario</b> <b>writers),</b> {{as well as the}} interface between <b>scenario</b> <b>writers</b> and agents. It raises a number of challenging issues to execute multi-agent scenarios: 1) How can <b>scenario</b> <b>writers</b> generate customized <b>scenarios</b> easily? 2) How can <b>scenario</b> <b>writers</b> monitor and control scenario execution so as to debug errors in scenarios? 3) How can agents negotiate for scenarios to achieve robust behavior against scenario errors? So, in this paper, we provide a web style GUI (Graphical User Interface) for <b>scenario</b> <b>writers</b> to customize <b>scenarios.</b> We propose a metalevel architecture for <b>scenario</b> <b>writers</b> to trace and control the execution of scenarios by observing scenarios, and for agents to negotiate with others as well as <b>scenario</b> <b>writers</b> for <b>scenarios.</b> The meta-level architecture is illustrated by an experimental multi-agent system of evacuation simulation. ...|$|R

5|$|The soundtrack was {{composed}} with strong traditional and Irish music influences, while the lyrics for the vocal tracks {{were written by}} the game's director Tetsuya Takahashi and its <b>scenario</b> <b>writer</b> Masato Kato. The soundtrack reached #55 in Japan and was generally well received by critics, though some disagreed on whether the album can be fully appreciated by non-players.|$|E
5|$|Tidus was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura with a cheerful appearance, in contrast to previous Final Fantasy protagonists. <b>Scenario</b> <b>writer</b> Kazushige Nojima wanted to expand the relationship between player and character with monologues describing the game's setting. Tidus is voiced primarily by Masakazu Morita in Japanese and James Arnold Taylor in English. Both actors enjoyed voicing the character, and Morita also performed his motion capture.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of the third Final Fantasy title in 1990, Square offered {{designer}} Koichi Ishii to direct a spin-off series game. It began development for the Game Boy under the working title Gemma Knights; eventually, Square revived the trademarked name and released the game as Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden. It was later released in Europe as Mystic Quest. Ishii suggested the basis of the game's story, while <b>scenario</b> <b>writer</b> Yoshinori Kitase helped write the game's script. Ishii designed all of the characters himself, while Goro Ohashi was responsible {{for the development of the}} game system.|$|E

5|$|As Tokyo Mew Mew {{became a}} viable project, Kodansha hired Reiko Yoshida {{to be the}} series' <b>scenario</b> <b>writer</b> and story supervisor. Yoshida and two other editors {{determined}} each volume's plot, created a scenario by adding stage directions and dialogue, and presented it to Ikumi. Ikumi added her own ideas and changes, creating the manuscript's first draft, which {{was taken to the}} publishers for final review and approval. This differs from most manga series, in which the manga writer also creates the scenarios and stories before submitting to their editor for approval.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 1998 as a compact side project to Genealogy of the Holy War, {{although}} it eventually grew considerably in scale. Series creator Shouzou Kaga acted as designer and <b>scenario</b> <b>writer,</b> the characters {{were designed by}} Mayumi Hirota, while the music was composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko. Kaga, Hirota and Tsujiyoko would later leave Intelligent Systems to pursue independent careers, with only Tsujiyoko returning to work on future games. The game was commercially successful upon release, although {{it was one of}} the poorer selling titles in the series as a whole. It also received positive reviews from critics. No version has been released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|Development of Invisible War began {{following}} {{the success of}} Deus Ex. The aim {{was to create a}} more accessible version of the original game's systems while preserving its essentials. Original designer Harvey Smith directed the game, while Alexander Brandon and Sheldon Pacotti returned respectively as composer and <b>scenario</b> <b>writer.</b> Additional music and voice work was provided by the rock band Kidneythieves. Due to being developed for PC and Xbox, the game's environments needed to be designed with the console's hardware limitations in mind. In later interviews, members of the team have faulted their decisions for the title.|$|E
40|$|The Q language—which {{describes}} interaction scenarios between {{agents and}} users based on agent external roles—provides an interface between computing professionals and <b>scenario</b> <b>writers.</b> Agent internal mechanisms {{form the basis}} for many of the languages proposed for describing agent behavior and interagent protocols. These mechanisms include Soar, 1 a general cognitive architecture for developing systems that exhibit intelligent behavior, and the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language, 2 a language and protocol for developing large-scale sharable and reusable knowledge bases. For the Web, however, we should also consider the needs of application designers such as sales managers, travel agents, and schoolteachers. To this end, we have been developing Q, a language for describing interaction scenarios between agents and users based on agent external roles. Q can also provide an interface between computing professionals and <b>scenario</b> <b>writers.</b> Rather than depending on agent internal mechanisms, Q seeks to describe how <b>scenario</b> <b>writers</b> should request that agents behave. The change in focus from agent internal mechanisms to interaction scenarios significantly affects the language’s syntax and semantics. For example, if an agent accepts only two requests, on and off, Q lets <b>scenario</b> <b>writers</b> use only the commands on and off. This does not mean the agent lacks intelligence, only that it is not controllable. Further, the only way to know the semantics of commands is to try them. For example, the semantics of the move command depend on whether the agent can run rapidly with a light step or move slowly, in a thoughtful manner. Since Q cannot control the agent’s internal mechanism, it cannot use functions—such as Java function calls—to implement detailed agent behavior. Scenarios also help establish a bridge between the computing professionals who design agents and the <b>scenario</b> <b>writers</b> who design applications. We can expect an effective dialog to emerge from the interplay between the two different perspectives during the process of formalizing interaction patterns. DESCRIBING SCENARIOS Q is an extension of Scheme, a Lisp programming language dialect. We introduce sensing and acting functions and guarded commands in Scheme. Since Scheme is Q’s mother language, all Scheme functions and forms can be used in any Q scenario...|$|R

5|$|In {{the adult}} {{versions}} of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Yuichi and a given heroine having sex. Later, Key released versions of Kanon without the erotic content. The versions that include the adult content have one explicit sex scene {{in each of the}} five main story routes, in addition to one fantasy scene. Outside of these, there are two scenes with nudity. Yūichi Suzumoto, a <b>scenario</b> <b>writer</b> who worked on later Key titles, commented that the sex scenes in Kanon are very self-contained, and can be easily removed without altering the story. Maeda remarked that the sex scenes were not written with reproduction in mind.|$|E
5|$|<b>Scenario</b> <b>writer</b> Kazushige Nojima {{stresses}} {{the dynamic of}} players' relationships with the main character in Final Fantasy games; thus, he puts significant thought into how that relationship will develop. With Final Fantasy VII, protagonist Cloud Strife's reserved nature led Nojima to include scenarios in which the player can select Cloud's responses to certain situations and dialogue. With Final Fantasy VIII, which also features a reserved lead protagonist in Squall, Nojima wanted to give players actual insight into what the protagonist is thinking, even while other characters remain uninformed: {{this led to the}} inner dialogues Squall has through the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{film is a}} {{condensed}} {{adaptation of}} Dickens' work, reviewers specifically highlighted the attention to detail and {{the limitations of the}} format when condensing the work to a single reel format.

He was unable to make heavy use of science fiction themes in Never 7, as his superiors at KID {{told him that the}} game needed to include cute girl characters in order to sell; he kept science fiction themes light, and the game was designed with a focus on dating game elements, with the main focus being to develop a relationship with a girl. The Dreamcast version included new scenarios not available in the PlayStation version.|$|E
5|$|Aerith was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura, with influence from director and <b>scenario</b> <b>writer</b> Yoshinori Kitase and Hironobu Sakaguchi, whilst Yoshitaka Amano created conceptual artwork which also helped to influence her design. She has green eyes and long brown hair tied in a braid with a pink ribbon. She wears a long pink dress, a bolero jacket, and brown hiking boots. The long dress {{was designed}} to appear ladylike and as a contrast to Tifa Lockhart's miniskirt. During development, Aerith {{was supposed to be}} Sephiroth's sister as both designs resembled each other, but they were made former lovers with Aerith remembering Sephiroth when meeting Cloud as both are ex-SOLDIERS. Late during development, Aerith's first love was changed to Zack Fair.|$|E
5|$|Jun Maeda, {{the main}} <b>scenario</b> <b>writer</b> of Air, commented {{that in the}} early stages of Air production, it was already decided that it was to be an adult game, and he further assumes that if it was not at least first {{released}} with adult content, that it would not have been as commercially successful. Maeda also commented that he wanted to write Air to give players the chance to experience the entire story as a whole rather than just a sum of differing parts as typical bishōjo games do, including Kanon. While attempting to do this, Maeda also tried to simultaneously make it seem similar to typical visual novels in the same genre as Air to give the game appeal to the players who often play such games. As such, while the game incorporates stories from several characters, they are all of varying lengths.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} team included director Takumi Nakazawa, <b>scenario</b> <b>writer</b> Kotaro Uchikoshi, music composers Takeshi Abo and Chiyomaru Shikura, {{and character}} designer Hidari. The game was originally {{planned to be}} titled Parasite and be unrelated to the Infinity series, but when production started it was given the project name Project Infinity 3. Nakazawa and Uchikoshi had creative differences regarding the game's ending, each having their own idea for how the game should end; because of this and time constraints, the ending was left in an unfinished state, with the development team planning to develop a sequel that would conclude the game's story. The game was positively received by reviewers at Famitsu and RPGFan, with the former complimenting the game system and plot, and the latter liking the character design and music.|$|E
5|$|When Kitase was put {{in charge}} of Final Fantasy VII, he and Nomura entirely {{reworked}} the initial plot. <b>Scenario</b> <b>writer</b> Kazushige Nojima joined the team after he had finished his work on Bahamut Lagoon. While Final Fantasy VI adopted a style of making all playable characters equally important, the team soon decided that they needed a central protagonist for Final Fantasy VII. The pursuit of Sephiroth that made up {{a large part of the}} main narrative was suggested by Nomura, as it had not been done in the series before. Kitase and Nojima conceived AVALANCHE and Shinra as opposing organizations, and created Cloud's backstory as well as his relationship to Sephiroth. Among Nojima's biggest contributions to the plot were Cloud's memories and split personality; this included the eventual conclusion involving his newly created character of Zack. The crew helped Kitase adjust the specifics of Sakaguchi's original Lifestream concept.|$|E
