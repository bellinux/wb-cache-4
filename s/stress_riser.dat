5000|$|Development of the Thury thread {{began in}} 1876, when the Horological Section of Geneva Society of Arts {{appointed}} {{a committee to}} look into the requirements for a uniform thread standard for use in Horological arts in Switzerland. Professor Thury began his studies by collecting and measuring samples of screws made by nine independent screw and screw tackle manufacturers in Switzerland. The Thury thread form was developed in 1878, thirty-seven years after the British Standard Whitworth thread form was designed in England and fourteen years after the United States Standard thread was presented in the United States. However, unlike these two predecessors, the Thury thread was designed for small-diameter screws which were then produced with screw plates. This production technique mandated that the Thury thread form have rounded crests and roots. Thread forms with rounded or [...] "radiused" [...] crests and roots like the Thury and Whitworth thread generate smaller stress risers than those forms like the American National or ISO metric which have truncated roots and crests; in modern engineering this is particularly important factor when tapping holes in acrylic plastic, where a larger <b>stress</b> <b>riser</b> can lead to an earlier onset of crack formation. The Thury thread is unusual in having a comparatively small 47.5° thread flank angle, which was chosen to make fabrication easier and to achieve greater holding capacity than screws with larger flank angles. Screws in the Thury thread system are given nominal sizes, with the base size [...] "0" [...] being six millimeters in diameter and having a thread pitch of one millimeter. Sizes are proportional, so a size [...] "1" [...] is ten percent smaller in diameter that a size [...] "0", while a size -1 is ten percent larger than a size [...] "0". The Thury thread was {{believed to be the first}} thread form to solve the problem of creating a single system of screw dimensions applicable to all sizes. The relationship between the pitch P of a Thury screw and its diameter D is expressed by the equation D=6P5/6. Another variable Thury standardized is the thread depth, which had until then been variable when cutting threads in different materials. The proliferation of the Thury standard was hindered when in 1882, the British Science Association produced a committee report on the consideration of a standard screw gauge, where they declined to accept the Thury thread but instead chose to use the Whitworth thread standard previously designed by committee member Joseph Whitworth, in part because the Whitworth form was historically successful and because the committee did not believe England was prepared to use a metric thread as its standard. However, the committee recognized the validity of many of the design aspects of the Thury thread, and a mere two years later published their specifications for the British Association (BA) thread. The BA committee made only slight modifications to the rounding radii of Thury thread and gave specifications rounded to the nearest mil.|$|E

50|$|Steel is {{a widely}} {{available}} material that has {{a major role in}} the construction industry. The use of nanotechnology in steel helps to improve the physical properties of steel. Fatigue, or the structural failure of steel, is due to cyclic loading. Current steel designs are based on the reduction in the allowable stress, service life or regular inspection regime. This has a significant impact on the life-cycle costs of structures and limits the effective use of resources. <b>Stress</b> <b>risers</b> are responsible for initiating cracks from which fatigue failure results. The addition of copper nanoparticles reduces the surface un-evenness of steel, which then limits the number of <b>stress</b> <b>risers</b> and hence fatigue cracking. Advancements in this technology through the use of nanoparticles would lead to increased safety, less need for regular inspection, and more efficient materials free from fatigue issues for construction.|$|R

Our experience suggests single bicortical 5 -mm pins placed in the femoral shaft have the added risk of creating a <b>stress</b> <b>riser</b> leading to the potential for fracture.

30|$|Several {{surgical}} options have evolved, including hybrid external fixation, intra-medullary nailing, conventional {{plates and}} locked plate fixation [7, 8, 11]. Less invasive stabilization systems offer advantages over conventional plates {{for the treatment}} of periprosthetic fractures associated with TKA [3, 12, 23]. These devices provide stable fixation in osteopenic bone, are adaptable to different types of fracture and prosthesis, and can be inserted by using a minimally invasive approach. These plates are particularly useful in the presence of an implant in the proximal femur as it allows uni-cortical screw fixation overlapping the distal part of the proximal implant, thus avoiding a <b>stress</b> <b>riser</b> between the two implants [3].|$|E
50|$|They {{appeared}} in the 1950s and their use was encouraged by developments in gas turbines. These demanded an increased production of fine investment castings that required careful polishing.

In this case report the use of a fixator-guided technique conferred certain advantages: (1) controlled gradual shortening; (2) control of rotation; (3) control over the axis of the femur; and (4) stable temporary fixation whilst the blade plate was inserted. To our knowledge this method of femoral shortening after total hip replacement has not been previously reported.|$|E

Disadvantages include the possibility of fracture below the implant (<b>stress</b> <b>riser</b> effect) and the fact that a short nail does not protect the remaining femur in a patient with a history of falling and probable osteoporosis. The advantages of a full-length nail include the increased protection of the remaining femur. Disadvantages include increased cost over short nails, the need for free hand locking, and the mismatch of the anterior bow of the nail compared to the bow of the femur [20].

A small, pyramidal ridge of cortical bone was demonstrated by radiographs and CT along the antero-lateral subtrochanteric region of the right femoral shaft. On MRI, there was focally increased T 2 signal in the adjacent bone marrow. Radionuclide bone scan showed moderately-intense, focally-increased uptake. The lesion was recognized as a potential <b>stress</b> <b>riser</b> for fracture; however, before a prophylactic intramedullary rod could be placed, the patient suffered a low-energy insufficiency fracture through the lesion.

40|$|Introduction. Diaphyseal {{fracture}} of radius could compromise function unless adequately treated. Open reduction and internal fixation with six cortices of screw fixation {{on either side}} of the fracture is generally accepted as the best method of treatment. Unfortunately, a very high rate of refracture after plate removal has been observed for as high as up to 22 %. Although a number of factors are thought to be the cause of such a high rate, such as the type of plate used, time from plating to plate removal, quality of reduction and compression achieved, type and duration of immobilization after plate removal, nevertheless, the <b>stress</b> <b>riser</b> from the screw holes is also considered as one of the important factor. In accordance with the <b>stress</b> <b>riser</b> from screw holes, number of screws introduced into bone played a very important role. The objective of this study is to biomechanically compare the load to failure between constructs for the treatment of diaphyseal transverse fractures of the radius in skeletally mature bone. Materials and methods. Sixteen skeletally mature human radii were retrieved, devoid of soft tissue including periosteum. Transverse osteotomy was done in each radius in its midpoint. In the control group, the radius was fixed with 6 -holes 6 -screws construct. In the test group, the radius was fixed with 6 -holes 4 -screws construct. All radii were fixed with 3. 5 mm mini Dynamic Compression Plates. They were then randomly divided into two groups, with each group consisted of four controls and four test specimens. Group I was tested in three-point bending force and group II was tested in axial compression force. Results. In the three-point bending test, the controls showed slightly higher load to failure but this value was not significant (p = 0. 57). Meanwhile in the axial compression test, the test group showed higher load to failure with a p-value of 0. 05 which was marginally significant. Conclusions. The 6 -holes 6 -screws construct showed higher load to failure when compared to the 6 -holes 4 -screws construct in terms of 3 -point bending force although the value was not significant. In contrast, the 6 -holes 4 -screws construct showed a higher load to failure in terms of axial compression force and the value was deemed marginally significant. Furthermore, failure starting point in this experimental study was observed in the screw holes...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} an {{experimental}} investigation on the effect of subcritical damage on the residual strength properties of notched composite laminates are presented. A procedure based on the digital image correlation method was applied to laminates subjected to static and fatigue tensile loading. The digital image correlation method (DICM) is a whole-field technique that calculates surface displacements and strains from digital images characterized by a random distribution of intensity grey levels. Graphite/PEEK (polyether ether ketone) and graphite/epoxy laminates with different stacking sequences were analysed and the damage progression near the <b>stress</b> <b>riser</b> was evaluated by means of the strain maps obtained by digital image correlation. It was found that damage developing before final fracture may significantly affect the structural performance of composite laminates. The digital image correlation technique allowed clarification of the beneficial or detrimental role played by the different failure mechanisms on the strain redistribution around the hole and, as a consequence, on the residual strength and fatigue life of notched samples. The findings of the investigation suggest that the DICM is an efficient and reliable tool for full-field monitoring and detailed damage characterization of structural composite element...|$|E

In a case reported by Ternes et al.

Internal fixation with distal femur locking plate and incorporation of the locking plate with the pre-existing dynamic condylar screw provided a good treatment option for this difficult problem.

50|$|A stress {{concentration}} (often called stress raisers or <b>stress</b> <b>risers)</b> is a location in an object where stress is concentrated. An object is stronger when force is evenly distributed over its area, so {{a reduction in}} area, e.g., caused by a crack, results in a localized increase in stress. A material can fail, via a propagating crack, when a concentrated stress exceeds the material's theoretical cohesive strength. The real fracture strength of a material is always lower than the theoretical value because most materials contain small cracks or contaminants (especially foreign particles) that concentrate stress. Fatigue cracks always start at stress raisers, so removing such defects increases the fatigue strength.|$|R

In particular, a new approach, based on the combination of the Ru-Aifantis theory of gradient elasticity and the Theory of Critical Distances (TCD), is proposed for the fatigue assessment of notched metallic components. The proposed methodology represents an important step forward respect to the state of the art, allowing an accurate fatigue assessment of engineering components, by post-processing the relevant gradient-enriched stresses directly {{on the surface of the}} component, with evident advantages from a practical point of view...|$|R
30|$|Gallie [12] first {{described}} the posterior approach to subtalar joint arthrodesis with insertion of bone {{block from the}} tibia without fixation in 1943. Carr et al. [4] later modified the technique by using an iliac crest graft and fully threaded screw fixation, this technique being similarly advocated by others [1, 3, 4]. However, some authors have also used either partially threaded or fully threaded screws placed with a lag technique for definitive fixation [5, 6, 22]. Different hardware configurations have been described to transfix the arthrodesis; this includes several single screw configurations and double parallel or divergent screws [9]. There are advantages and disadvantages described for each technique. Gable et al. cited a preference for placement of the screw from the posterior calcaneal tuberosity because it eliminates potential problems associated with screw placement from the dorsal neck of the talus into the calcaneum. The talar neck approach may cause anterior ankle impingement or a <b>stress</b> <b>riser</b> at {{the neck of the}} talus that would necessitate hardware removal. This approach also can jeopardize the blood supply to the talus, causing avascular necrosis of the talar head [11, 18]. In addition, Hutchinson [16] reported the advantage of increased density in the cancellous bone of the talus when compared with the calcaneum, theoretically offering more compression strength with the posterior calcaneal screw fixation approach.|$|E

The {{goals of the}} finger joint implant arthroplasty are to relieve pain, to correct deformity, and to improve the function and appearance of the hand. Several prosthetic implants {{have been used for}} the replacement of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. Pyrocarbon materials, a form of pyrolytic carbon, a ceramic-like material, have proven to be strong, durable, resistant to wear and nonreactive in the body. The Ascension PIP pyrocarbon total joint is a bicondylar, anatomically shaped, articulating implant that allows joint flexion–extension, while providing some restriction of adduction–abduction motion. A review of the literature of pyrocarbon PIP prosthesis reveals little clinical data. The case of a 33 -year-old man with posttraumatic arthritis proximal interphalangeal joint right long finger is reported. The case was treated surgically using the Ascension PIP total joint. During the insertion of the implant, the proximal component fractured at the sub-articular collar. The component was removed, and a new implant was inserted without complication. Critical evaluation revealed that there was an inadequate resection of the volar lip resulting in a <b>stress</b> <b>riser</b> on the implant during impaction.

40|$|During routine {{inspections}} of the Space Shuttle's Main Propulsion System (MPS) Liquid Oxygen (LO 2) pre-valve, the mechanism provided {{to maintain the}} valve {{in the open position}} was found cracked. The mechanism is a Vespel roller held against the valve visor by a stack of Belleville springs. The roller has been found cracked 3 times. All three instances were in the same valve in the same location. There are 6 pre-valves on each orbiter, and only one has exhibited this problem. Every-flight inspections were instituted and the rollers were found to be cracked after only one flight. Engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center, Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center worked together to determine a solution. There were several possible contributors to the failure: a mis-aligned visor, an out of specification edge with a sharp radius, an out of specification tolerance stack up of a Belleville spring stack that caused un-predicted loads on the Vespel SP- 21 roller, and a dimple machined {{into the side of the}} roller to indicate LO 2 compatibility that created a <b>stress</b> <b>riser.</b> The detent assembly was removed and replaced with parts that were on the low-side of the tolerance stack up to eliminate the potential for high loads on the detent roller.
