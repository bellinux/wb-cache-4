50|$|Fossil erycines {{have been}} found in rock strata over 50 million years old, and were once {{widespread}} in North America. Now, only two species remain in North America, as well as the <b>sand</b> <b>boas</b> in Africa, Asia, and southeastern Europe.|$|R

50|$|Eryx jayakari, known {{commonly}} as the Arabian <b>sand</b> <b>boa</b> or Jayakar's <b>sand</b> <b>boa,</b> is {{a species}} of snake in the Boidae family. It is endemic to the Arabian Peninsula and Iran where it spends the day buried in the sand.

50|$|Otherwise {{far removed}} from their boine relatives, they are {{generally}} ovoviviparous, i.e., giving birth to live young. At least three species lay eggs, however: the Calabar python, Charina reinhardtii (once regarded as a python for this reason), the Arabian <b>sand</b> <b>boa,</b> Eryx jayakari, and the West African <b>sand</b> <b>boa,</b> E. muelleri.|$|E
50|$|In {{the scrub}} habitat of western Rajasthan, they live largely on desert gerbils, but also hunt hares, rats, doves, gray partridges, sandgrouses, peafowl, bulbuls, sparrows and eat eggs of ground birds. They {{have also been}} {{observed}} killing cobras, saw-scale vipers, <b>sand</b> <b>boas,</b> geckos, scorpions and beetles.|$|R
25|$|Snake House is the serpentarium of the Lahore Zoo. It {{was closed}} in June 2007 when about 20 snakes {{died because of}} suffocation. After being renovated, it was reopened on April 30, 2010.

50|$|Pythons were {{sometimes}} {{classified as a}} subfamily of Boidae, the Pythoninae, but are in this case listed under their own family, the Pythonidae. In the same way, the Old World <b>sand</b> <b>boas,</b> the Erycinae, are also frequently listed under their own family, the Erycidae. Additionally, morphological studies place the subfamily Ungaliophiinae in Tropidophiidae, whereas all molecular analyses place them as sister group of Charina-Lichanura clade, within Boidae.|$|R
50|$|Adult female {{specimens}} {{are rarely}} more than 91 cm (3 feet) in length. These snakes are heavily built with small heads, small eyes, and short tails. The color pattern may {{consist of a}} yellow or orange coloration overlaid with dark brown splotches. The belly is white or cream colored.They are readily available in the pet trade due to their small size, docility and ease of care. In recent years {{there have been a}} number of new morphs made available by both commercial and hobby breeders. Some of the more popular morphs available include anerythristic Kenyan <b>sand</b> <b>boas</b> (black and white lacking orange/red simple recessive trait), albino Kenyan <b>sand</b> <b>boas</b> (lacking black pigment simple recessive), snow KSBs (double recessive combination of an anery and albino), stripes (normal colored, anerythristic, albino and snow), hypo/ghost, anerythristic KSBs, paradox albinos (simple recessive), paradox snows (double recessive trait), splash (recessive), paint (recessive) and stripe combinations with any of the listed recessive traits. In addition many line bred traits have been accentuated on the above morphs, such as Nuclears (extreme red), High Whites, Reduced Patterns as examples.|$|R
50|$|The Booidea, {{also known}} as booid snakes, are a {{superfamily}} of snakes that contains boas (family Boidae) and other closely related boa-like snakes (but not pythons, which are in a separate superfamily called Pythonoidea).

50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>boas</b> are {{generally}} nocturnal and live on {{or under the}} surface of the ground. They can disappear with great rapidity into the sand, moving along just under the surface. They mostly hide by day under stones, in crevices or in shallow burrows, but may emerge onto the surface in overcast conditions. They feed on mammals, lizards and birds, usually lying in wait hidden in the sand with just their eyes and snout above the surface. They may also take nestling birds and eggs. Large prey are killed by constriction or by squeezing them against a rock. Small prey may be smothered beneath the sand. These snakes are ovoviviparous, the female brooding a clutch of eggs internally until they hatch after four or five months.|$|R
