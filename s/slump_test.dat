The variables in this study is coarse aggregate while the cement, sand and water-cement ratio were held constant. The crushed waste glass was varied from 0 – 100 % in steps of 25 % by weight to replace the coarse aggregate in the concrete mix.

30|$|It {{has been}} {{found out that the}} true {{workability}} of SFC cannot be ascertained by the <b>slump</b> <b>tests</b> as the fibers significantly affect the rheology of fresh concrete. At lower fiber factors concrete was more workable than at higher fiber factors based on the laboratory and field casting experiences. During casting of full-scale beam specimens it was interesting to observe that the compaction energy required for SFC was almost same as for non-fibrous concrete. This was evidently due to the absence of the traditional rebars resulting in lower hindrance to compact fresh concrete in the beams. A satisfactory level of workability and finish was achieved for all the fibrous mixes used in casting the beams.|$|R

The analysis of the results shows that for some formulations, the addition of hollow glass microspheres imparts high mechanical strength to compressive strength above 30 MPa at all analyzed cure periods. The workability of the concrete had to be substantially reduced, showing no workability improvement due to the addition of hollow glass microsphere...|$|R

Results show that the simple shear behaviour of all these natural flows clearly distinguishes the type of movement, in particular for earthflow and debris flow. Furthermore, some proportion mixtures present the highest mobility properties, and thus the highest susceptibility for transformation into high-speed flow-like phenom-ena.

However,the spreading process observed on different PMMs shows the opposite. Indeed, low polymer-amount-PMMs spread due to mixing water effect. By the other side, high polymer-amount-PMMs slump under their own weight and their flow is lower. Therefore, during a repair, low polymer-amount-PMMs are easily spread on the repaired surface, which promote a good adhesion, while high polymer-amount-PMMs have less contact with repaired surface, which results in a low adherence...|$|R

Concrete slump is generally known to affect the consistency, flowability, pumpability, compactibility, and harshness of a concrete mix. Hence, an accurate prediction of this property is a practical need of construction engineers. This research proposes a machine learning model for predicting concrete slump based on the Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LS-SVR). LS-SVR is employed to model the nonlinear mapping between the mix components and slump values.
