5|$|Kratos recovers Pandora's Box from Ares, opens it, {{and uses}} {{its power to}} become godlike. Despite Ares' best efforts to destroy Kratos {{physically}} and mentally, including stripping him of the Blades of Chaos and all magic, he survives and kills Ares with the Blade of the Gods. Athens is saved, and although Athena tells Kratos his sins are forgiven, the gods refuse to rid him of his nightmares. Forsaken by the gods, he tries to commit suicide by casting himself into the Aegean Sea, but Athena intervenes and transports him to Mount Olympus. As a reward for his services to the gods, she provides Kratos with a new <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> and the seat as the new God of War.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{recounts the}} events of the game and offers deeper {{insights}} into its story, explaining that Athena wanted Kratos to kill Ares and explaining how she manipulated the other gods, with the exception of Zeus, into aiding Kratos. After learning of Athena's plans, Zeus decides to aid Kratos (with magic and as the gravedigger) with the intention of Kratos becoming the new God of War after killing Ares. Poseidon is persuaded by Athena when she convinces him that Ares brought the Hydra into his domain. Artemis is persuaded because Ares and his minions are destroying her wilderness and its wildlife, and by aiding Kratos she will prevent future destruction. Athena manipulates Aphrodite into believing that Medusa is plotting against her. Hades, however, is omitted from the book, as Kratos does not meet him or gain his magic. Another omission from the book is the part where Kratos receives a new <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> from Athena, and the Blades of Chaos is revealed to have been forged by Hephaestus in Tartarus.|$|E
2500|$|A report {{released}} by the investigation team in mid-March, by Ukrainian [...] "Aviation and Time" [...] magazine, provided preliminary details into the cause. According to the report, immediately after take-off one of the engines was automatically shut off by its electronic safeguards after it exceeded the safe RPM limit. The front <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> of the contra rotating propeller assembly stopped but the aft [...] part of the propeller assembly continued turning due to the damaged oil line that powered the blade actuators. This caused the negative air flow estimated at 5,000kg/11,023lbs. of thrust.|$|E
50|$|Reaction Turbomachines operate by {{reacting}} to the flow of fluid through aerofoil shaped rotor and stator <b>blades.</b> The velocity <b>of</b> the fluid through the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> increases slightly (as with a nozzle) as it passes from rotor to stator and vice versa. The velocity of the fluid then decreases again once it has passed between the gap. Pressure and enthalpy consistently decrease through the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|R

They're a wild <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> under me, and mind the helm no better than a washing-tub, so that my orders {{have little or no}} weight with them. All the same, if you're the man to come aboard, and have the courage to face the matter out, I'll do what I can to see that no harm happens to you. But if you'll take a friend's advice you'll stay where you are, and let a bad matter cure itself, for you know very well that there is no use {{splicing}} a rotten rope. As for the pickle you're in, lay that to your luck, and not to me.|$|E

50|$|An ideal {{steam turbine}} is {{considered}} to be an isentropic process, or constant entropy process, in which the entropy of the steam entering the turbine is equal to the entropy of the steam leaving the turbine. No steam turbine is truly isentropic, however, with typical isentropic efficiencies ranging from 20-90% based on the application of the turbine. The interior of a turbine comprises several <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> or buckets. One <b>set</b> <b>of</b> stationary <b>blades</b> is connected to the casing and one <b>set</b> <b>of</b> rotating <b>blades</b> is connected to the shaft. The sets intermesh with certain minimum clearances, with the size and configuration <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> varying to efficiently exploit the expansion of steam at each stage.|$|R
50|$|For {{the engine}} {{optimisation}} for its intended use, important here is air intake design, overall size, number <b>of</b> compressor stages (<b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades),</b> fuel type, number of exhaust stages, metallurgy of components, amount of bypass air used, where the bypass air is introduced, {{and many other}} factors. For instance, let us consider design of the air intake.|$|R
50|$|The {{years since}} the {{construction}} of the boat house have been highly successful with both the men's and women's sides achieving numerous <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> (bumping up on every day of Torpids or Summer Eights). The most recent of these occurred in 2015, when both the men's and women's first eights won blades in Torpids (a first in the college's history).|$|R
50|$|As an analogy, {{the hub of}} {{the rotary}} woofer's fan is {{somewhat}} like a helicopter's swashplate which allows a stationary source of reciprocating motion—the voice coil of the subwoofer—to change the angle of the spinning <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|E
50|$|Gigar: Appears in episode 39. Powers include {{retracting}} {{into its}} tail, sharp claws, a rib cage-like <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> that extend long distances, flight, invisibility, needle missiles from below the neck capable of shredding Mutronium, {{and a large}} blade resistant mace tail.|$|E
50|$|A rotary {{snowplow}} is a {{piece of}} railroad snow removal equipment with a large circular <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> on its front end that rotate to cut through the snow on the track ahead of it. The precursor to the rotary snowplow was the wedge snowplow.|$|E
50|$|This is {{then passed}} over the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> moving <b>blades.</b> As the steam flows over the moving blades nearly all its {{velocity}} is absorbed. However, the pressure remains constant during this process. After this it is passed into the nozzle ring and is again partially expanded. Then it is fed into the next <b>set</b> <b>of</b> moving <b>blades,</b> and this process is repeated until the condenser pressure is reached.|$|R
50|$|The term {{compounding}} is {{a little}} less restrictive than compound engine. Large compound turbines are an application of compounding, as are the multiple rows <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> used in many gas turbines, but neither is normally {{referred to as a}} compound engine. The several <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> in a single turbine are perhaps better thought of as similar in principle to the uniflow steam engine than to compounding. Unlike the uniflow steam engine, which has found niche uses only, multiple row turbines have found enormous practical application.|$|R
5000|$|Swiss steak: Refers to {{the meat}} having {{gone through a}} process called swissing, which refers to fabric or other {{materials}} being pounded or run through rollers in order to soften it. Swiss steak is typically made from relatively tough cuts of meat, such as the round, which have been pounded with a tenderizing hammer, or run through a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>bladed</b> rollers to produce so-called [...] "cube steak".|$|R
50|$|Nineteen {{objects were}} {{discovered}} in the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> which appear {{very similar to those}} used in the Egyptian opening of the mouth ceremony (a ritual performed {{for the benefit of the}} deceased to enable an afterlife). These blades are also intricately linked to iron and stars, being described in temple inventories as composed of iron and were themselves frequently referred to as the stars.|$|E
50|$|The {{most recent}} <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> (bumping up on {{every day of}} Torpids or Summer Eights) for the men's and women's boat club were won in 2014. In Eights, SPCBC {{finished}} with two sets of blades for M1 and W2 finishing off an excellent year for the club, in which a St. Peter's coxed four had also won Worcester Regatta for the second time, beating Worcester University easily in the final.|$|E
50|$|A turbine is a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> {{that are}} forced to turn from an {{external}} force. When the blades start turning, the shaft which this is connected to starts to spin, and the connecting generator then creates electricity. Examples of external forces {{that can be used}} to get the turbines going include wind, water, steam and gas. Turbines can be used in creating a continual power system because as long as the turbine blades turn, electricity is being created.|$|E

50|$|The club {{currently}} {{shares a}} club room and boat storage space with St Hilda's College Boat Club at the Longbridges boathouse, {{which opened in}} April 1997. On 4 July 2005 Longbridges boathouse was hit by an arson attack which destroyed most of the equipment owned by MCBC. However, thanks {{to the efforts of}} the committee, the college and the generosity of alumni, the club was able to replace old equipment with newer boats and two new <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Drill bits are broadly {{classified}} into two main types {{according to their}} primary cutting mechanism. Rolling cutter bits drill largely by fracturing or crushing the formation with [...] "tooth"-shaped cutting elements on two or more cone-shaped elements that roll {{across the face of}} the borehole as the bit is rotated. Fixed cutter bits employ a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> with very hard cutting elements, most commonly natural or synthetic diamond, to remove material by scraping or grinding action as the bit is rotated.|$|E

5000|$|Made {{famous by}} {{saturation}} television advertising in the mid- and late 1960s, Veg-O-Matic is a manually operated slicer, primarily made of injection-molded plastic, which held {{two sets of}} parallel cutting blades. The Veg-O-Matic is shaped approximately like an upper-case letter [...] "H" [...] and had an integral operating handle. The item to be cut, such as a potato, {{is placed on the}} top <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades,</b> and then is pushed vertically down through the blades by the handle, while the user's hands are kept safely away from the cutter by the shape of the handle.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, St. Peter’s Men’s Novice A boat beat {{six other}} men’s A crews and one B crew to win Christ Church Regatta {{for the first}} time in the club's history. In Torpids 2009, SPCBC {{finished}} not only with two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> (5 and 6 bump blades for M1 and M2) but +15 net bumps, and five competing crews which is the most the club has put out since 1998. 2009 saw the Men's 1st VIII also winning the novice plate event at Bedford Amateur Regatta.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, {{gasoline-powered}} {{lawn mowers}} were first manufactured in 1914 by Ideal Power Mower Co. of Lansing, Michigan, {{based on a}} patent by Ransom E. Olds. Ideal Power Mower also introduced the world's first self-propelled, riding lawn tractor in 1922, known as the [...] "Triplex". The roller-drive lawn mower has changed very little since around 1930. Gang mowers, those with multiple <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> to cut a wider swath, {{were built in the}} United States in 1919 by the Worthington Mower Company.|$|R

50|$|Features a {{spinning}} <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades,</b> whose mount {{can be removed}} to form {{a spinning}}-blade weapon for the robot mode. It also includes a small, non-transforming Scorponok figure with a spring-tail that can be dropped from a basket in Blackouts helicopter mode. In vehicle mode, Blackout can combine with the Deluxe Class movie Scorponok figure (sold separately) in a combined gimmick: rotating Blackouts rotors will cause Scorponoks claws to spin. Blackout lacks the arm-mounted weapons seen in the film, but his robot mode does have sculpted missiles detailed on its shoulders. It is the smallest Voyager-class sized figure, despite his actual size in the movie being larger than the others. The figure has features based on a concept art image rather than the actual character from the movie.|$|E
5000|$|According to legend, {{the flying}} {{guillotine}} {{could be held}} by {{the top of the}} dome, allowing it {{to be used as a}} melee weapon or thrown like a flying buzzsaw. However, its deadliest application was its alleged ability to be thrown onto a victim's head, whereby a tug of the chain would release the rim from the main body and envelop the head in a silken trap before a second tug triggered a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> hidden in the interior of the rim to close shut and decapitate the target, hence its anglicized name. However, there is evidence that the weapon may have been used by being soaked with poison powerful enough to kill another person [...] "at the sight of a drip of blood", thus giving it its Chinese name.|$|E
50|$|Better recruitment, {{coaching}} and continuing {{financial support from}} the College and alumnae community enabled the Club to build depth and breadth in its crews once more. From 2010 onwards, the 1st VIII had not conceded a Bump in either of the Bumps races, had earned a total <b>of</b> five <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> in five years and has been making progress on reclaiming a first division position on the May Bumps charts. Murray Edwards won the Pegasus Cup in 2011 after a solid performance in May Bumps, which secured blades for both its crews.|$|R
