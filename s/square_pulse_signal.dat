40|$|Transformation {{of square}} pulse signals by the {{multilayer}} Rosen type piezoelectric transformer (PT) is investigated {{with the goals}} to preserve the signal waveform and achieve maximum efficiency for power electronics and LED lighting applications. The voltage gain of the transformer is calculated from equations of linear piezoelectricity and motion for a broad frequency range that includes multiple resonant frequencies of PT. The transformation of the square pulse is simulated numerically by applying the voltage gain function to the Fourier spectrum of the input signal, and then restoring the time domain output signal from its spectrum. A half bridge MOSFET amplifier is built to drive the PT in the experimental setup. The measurements of the input and output waveforms and their Fourier spectra verify the calculations. It is shown that {{the components of the}} spectrum and the waveform of the <b>square</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>signal</b> can be preserved in the output signal by using multiple resonant frequencies of the transformer. With the accurate match between the signal harmonics and the resonant frequencies of the transformer voltage gain, the <b>square</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>signal</b> provides higher output power than a sine or a square wave, provided that the dominant harmonics of all signals have the same amplitude...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} a new {{design for a}} split Hopkinson tensile bar (SHTB) as well as generated representative experimental results. The new design uses a U shaped striker bar as projectile and addresses several shortcomings of classical SHTB designs using hollow striker bars. The results presented show that the non-symmetrical striker bar is capable of generating a clean and virtually oscillation free <b>square</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>signal</b> five times longer than typically achieved by classical striker tubes, whilst {{at the same time}} offering superior signal quality. Due to the longer stress pulse duration, the new SHTB design allows for the characterisation of materials at strain rates that were difficult to achieve for hydraulic testing machines and classical striker tube based SHTB designs. In addition, the developed SHTB is based on a simple and modular design and allows {{for a wide range of}} pulse shaping methodologies to be applied. Therefore, materials requiring different input stress pulse shapes, such as square (ductile), trapezoid or triangular (brittle), can be experimentally characterised at a large range of strain rates. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Complete thermal characteristics, including frequency-dependent thermal impedance and phase lag behavior, are presented. The analysis is also extended for arbitrary periodic or aperiodic pulse heating operation to predict junction temperature of a Power Amplifier (PA) with non-constant envelope input signal. Dynamic junction temperatures of a single finger 2 µm× 20 µm GaAs HBT are predicted for <b>square</b> <b>pulse</b> envelope <b>signal</b> input with power levels varying with up to 10 dB above a nominal average level of 40 mW and with pulse widths ranging from 10 ns to 100 µs. With the input envelope signal amplitude of 10 dB above the average, the analytical results show that junction temperature rises from room temperature of 27 ◦C to 39 ◦C when heated by 10 ns pulse and increases to 63 ◦C by 100 ns pulse, 105 ◦C by 1 µs pulse and to 198 ◦C by 100 µs pulse. A novel setup is developed for nano-second pulsed measurements, and the analysis is validated through time domain on wafer pulsed measurements at three different power levels: 0 dB, 3 dB, and 6 dB above the average level.

40|$|International audiencePhotodynamic therapy (PDT) is an {{alternative}} treatment for cancer that involves the administration of a photosensitizing agent, which will be activated by light at a specific wavelength. In order to compare different photosensitisers for their cytotoxic activity, photophysical parameters provide good indicators. These parameters are generally estimated one by one from in vitro dedicated experiments, but they cannot always predict the in vivo cytotoxic action.

40|$|FDMAS {{has been}} {{successfully}} used in microwave imaging for breast cancer detection. FDMAS gained its popularity due to its capability to produce results faster than any other adaptive beamforming technique such as minimum variance (MV) which requires higher computational complexity. The average computational time for single point spread function (PSF) at 40 mm depth for FDMAS is 87 times faster than MV. The new beamforming technique has been tested on PSF and cyst phantoms experimentally with the ultrasound array research platform version 2 (UARP II) using a 3 - 8 MHz 128 element clinical transducer. FDMAS is able to improve both imaging contrast and spatial resolution as compared to DAS. The wire phantom main lobes lateral resolution improved in FDMAS by 40. 4 % with <b>square</b> <b>pulse</b> excitation <b>signal</b> when compared to DAS. Meanwhile the contrast ratio (CR) obtained for an anechoic cyst located at 15 mm depth for PWI with DAS and FDMAS are - 6. 2 dB and - 14. 9 dB respectively. The ability to reduce noise from off axis with auto-correlation operation in FDMAS {{pave the way to}} display the B-mode image with high dynamic range. However, the contrast to noise ratio (CNR) measured at same cyst location for FDMAS give less reading compared to DAS. Nevertheless, this drawback can be compensated by applying compound plane wave imaging (CPWI) technique on FDMAS. In overall the new FDMAS beamforming technique outperforms DAS in laboratory experiments by narrowing its main lobes and increases the image contrast without sacrificing its frame rates...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} {{literature}} study into, {{and the design}} of a system for, indoor geolocation. The most accurate method for indoor geolocation with RF signals is a distance measurement, utilizing time-of-flight. Multilateration can be used to determine the location of a device, if multiple distances between this device and other devices with known locations is available. In the distance measurement between these nodes, one node is called the measurement node, and the other the relay node. A short 2 ns <b>square</b> <b>pulse</b> modulated <b>signal</b> of 8 GHz will be sent from the measurement node to the relay node. This node divides the frequency of the pulse by 2, and returns this pulse. The measurement node receives this 4 GHz pulse and measures the time of travel with a timer. The time of travel is directly proportional to the distance. Multipath is the interference of reflected signals on the signal travelling over the direct path. This makes a phase measurement, as means of determining time of travel, impossible. By sending 2 ns pulses, multipath interference is almost completely eliminated, because in most situations pulses that arrive over multipaths, arrive after 2 ns. Since the pulse is sent roundtrip, time synchronization issues have been eliminated. The frequency of the pulse is divided to allow the measurement node to distinguish between a pulse returned by the relay node, and one reflected off obstacles. A preliminary IC design has been made. The estimate of power usage is 40 mW. This project has provided the chair of IC Design with information and easy access to additional information about indoor geolocation. Furthermore, it has proven that the phase difference method is not feasible. Power bottlenecks and design shortcomings have been identified. Interference of other ultrawideband devices are a threat to the validity of the measurement. It is expected that a CDMA communication method is necessary to eliminate this. This will require a significant amount of additional power.
