500|$|The Government, {{the main}} {{executive}} {{power of the}} Croatian state, is headed by the prime minister (PM). The PM currently has four deputies (elected by the Croatian Parliament), who also serve as government ministers; there are 16 other ministers, who are appointed by the prime minister {{with the approval of}} the Sabor (by absolute majority vote). The government ministers are each in charge of a particular <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> such as Foreign Affairs. The prime minister and all the deputies form an inner cabinet, tasked with coordinating and supervising the work of government ministers on behalf of the PM; the inner cabinet also prepares materials for meetings of the full government cabinet (consisting of the inner cabinet and the remaining 16 ministers). The first deputy prime minister also discharges the duties of the prime minister when the latter is incapacitated or absent. State secretaries (...) are the highest officials below each minister. There are one or more State secretaries in the ministries. Each State secretary is appointed by the Government for the term of the minister, and is responsible to the minister. They act as deputy ministers and attend Government meetings only exceptionally. State secretaries are also heads of the Central State Offices (see below).|$|E

40|$|Preparedness {{to adapt}} to the impacts of climate change was {{assessed}} for three important <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> within the Irish coastal and marine environment, namely tourism, fisheries, and conservation of biodiversity. Information on the current status <b>of</b> each <b>sector</b> is a valuable point of reference in terms of accessing contribution to the implementation of future national adaptation efforts. A modified version of the National Adaptive Capacity (NAC) framework developed by the World Resources Institute was used to assess the three <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> This framework is structured around five functions: assessment, prioritisation, coordination, information management, and climate risk reduction; results of the assessment suggest that all three sectors are at the nascent stages of the climate change adaptation process. Currently there is no dedicated national policy guidance or legal support mechanism on adaptation in Ireland; hence there is no national financial commitment to support implementation of adaptation actions for any <b>of</b> the <b>sectors</b> assessed. Subjecting these three selected <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> to such an assessment enables identification of existing actions that can potentially support current adaptation, as well as where issues such as knowledge gaps and lack of policy support hinder progress.

Thus, we expect that the dynamics <b>of</b> growth, the <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> and the socio-demographic characteristics of the self-employed differ between the countries. The empirical analyses are based on the national Labour Force Surveys of 1984 and 1994 (Germany 1982 and 1995). Our findings indicate that educational requirements differ fundamentally between the three countries and along industrial branches. Further, we could observe some country-specific developments in some <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> but also a remarkable number of common general patterns in the development of self-employment.
