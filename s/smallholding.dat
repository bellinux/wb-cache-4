5|$|John {{was born}} at Low-land, a <b>smallholding</b> at Cefneithin. He was the second child of William and Vimy John, his brother Delville was three years his senior. John had a further four siblings, Alan, Clive, Madora and Diane. All three of his {{brothers}} played rugby. Delville played for Cefneithin, captaining them for two seasons; Alan progressed from the local club to Llanelli and also toured Argentina with Wales; while Clive was a Llanelli wing forward who was selected for Wales 'B'. The family went to live at Foelgastell, staying with an uncle and aunt, shortly after John's birth but returned to Cefneithin when John was two. His early schooling was at Cefneithin Primary, and after failing his 11-Plus he spent a year at Cross Hands senior centre. He passed the entrance exam and was accepted into Gwendraeth Grammar School at Drefach.|$|E

25|$|British {{corporations}} {{dominated the}} lucrative rubber industry and {{large tracts of}} land were dominated by these British corporations such as Dunlop Plantation, Guthrie Plantation and Harrisons & Crossfield. However, the British agricultural policy during that period discouraged participation of indigenous communities in the export crop economy, despite interest in <b>smallholding</b> rubber plantations. This development left the indigenous population in subsistence agriculture producing largely for domestic production and consumption, while the British and other communities expanded their interest in commercial agricultural production and dominated the export crop economy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Smallhold</b> {{production}} of cider made on farms as a beverage for labourers died out in Wales during the 20th century. Cider and perry production began a dramatic revival {{in the early}} 2000s, with many small firms entering production throughout the country. The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) has actively encouraged this trend, and Welsh ciders and perries have won many awards at CAMRA festivals; meanwhile, the establishment of groups such as UKCider and the Welsh Perry & Cider Society have spurred communication among producers.|$|R
25|$|<b>Smallholding</b> farmers {{not only}} {{frequently}} lack access to markets, they lack {{access to resources}} that lead to sustainable cocoa farming practices. Lack of sustainability can be due to pests, diseases that attack cocoa trees, lack of farming supplies, and {{lack of knowledge about}} modern farming techniques. One issue pertaining to cocoa plantation sustainability is the amount of time it takes for a cocoa tree to produce pods. A solution to this is to change the type of cocoa tree being farmed. In Ghana, a hybrid cocoa tree yields two crops after three years rather than the typical one crop after five years.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with his}} brother Henry, Cromwell had kept a <b>smallholding</b> of {{chickens}} and sheep, selling eggs and wool to support himself, his lifestyle resembling that of a yeoman farmer. In 1636 Cromwell inherited control of various properties in Ely from his uncle on his mother's side, and his uncle's job as tithe collector for Ely Cathedral. As a result, his income {{is likely to have}} risen to around £300–400 per year; {{by the end of the}} 1630s Cromwell had returned to the ranks of acknowledged gentry. He had become a committed Puritan and had established important family links to leading families in London and Essex.|$|E
25|$|Close to Kirkmuir (previously Laigh Kirkmuir), a farm {{occupied}} by William Mure in 1692, is the Freezeland plantation (previously Fold Park) on the turnpike as {{marked on the}} 1858 OS. Nowadays it is a <b>smallholding</b> without a dwelling house. The origin of the name is unclear, although 'furz' or furs' is old Scots for gorse or whin, however {{the existence of this}} small patch of fenced off land may be linked to the reference in Thomson's 1832 map to a fold, either for sheep or cattle. In 1799 the surrounding field is known as Fold Park. It could have been a pen for strayed stock or be connected with the tolls on the turnpike in some way or a 'stell', the Scot's word for a partial enclosure made by a wall or trees, to serve as a shelter for sheep or cattle. A building may have existed here. Kirkmuir was farmed by John Brown (died 21 August 1880, aged 54) and his wife Catherine Anderson (died 27 August 1895, aged 72). James Walker (died 11 December 1926, aged 86) and his wife Mary Woodburn (died 27 April 1899, aged 57) also farmed Kirkmuir. They were all buried in the Laigh Kirk graveyard.|$|E
50|$|Briskeby was {{originally}} two <b>smallhold</b> farms under Frogner Manor that became independent when the property Lille Frogner {{was separated from}} the main farm. Briskeby road was the farm's border with Christiania Bymarka (from Skovveien to Holt Street), and from 1859 also the border toward the city itself. The wooden houses that were built here from the 1820s became a suburb of the city, and it retained its character even after Frogner was incorporated into Kristiania city in 1878. Some of the old wooden buildings from this period are preserved.|$|R
40|$|Agriculture in Kenya {{consists}} {{mainly of}} <b>smallhold</b> farming that produce {{the majority of}} the total agricultural products. Until the late 1900 s soil fertility was maintained through good farming practices with fallow periods, crop rotations and fertilization with livestock manure. Due to the increasing demand for food and the scarcity of land the present agricultural production cannot maintain these practices. Agricultural land is therefore losing soil fertility as most farmers cannot afford to buy fertilizers and often lack the knowledge of other alternative practices. A possible measure to increase soil fertility and carbon content is by biochar amendment. Biochar is produced through pyrolysis, a process when organic material is turned into carbonaceous material during heating with low to no access of. Biochar consist of both stable and easy degradable parts. This is a Minor Field Study concerning biochar amendment in <b>smallhold</b> farming where the maize mixed farming system is utilized. The aim was to examine the effect of biochar as a soil amendment on decomposition of organic matter and on plant growth of maize under varying soil moisture conditions in Kisumu, Western Kenya. Soils from two nearby farms were used in a pot trial. The results from soil analyses showed that the amendment of biochar significantly increased pH, carbon content, the total amount of magnesium and calcium in both farms.

Obtaining a divorce was not easy in the 1920s; when asked in court for the reason James left, Nagle answered [...] "He must have got bored with me." [...] The divorce took place in 1928, five years before her husband's death. At the time of the divorce she was living on a <b>smallholding</b> near Headley, but returned to Sulhamstead in 1932 after inheriting land and money from Sir William. Ten years later, in 1942, she purchased Westerlands, a farm in Petworth, so she could personally oversee the stables.|$|E
500|$|Alfred Ernest Ramsey {{was born}} on 22 January 1920 at 6 Parrish Cottages, Halbutt Street in Dagenham, which was then an agrarian village in Essex, about [...] east of central London. He was the third of five children, four boys and a girl, born to Herbert Ramsey, a manual {{labourer}} who worked a <b>smallholding,</b> kept pigs and drove a horse-drawn dustcart, and his wife Florence (née Bixby). Parrish Cottages lacked hot running water and electricity, and the only toilet was outside. Such conditions were typical of Dagenham during this period, although Ramsey's street gradually became something of an anachronism as he grew up. From 1921, London County Council transformed the area into the Becontree estate, a vast urban community that by 1934 was home to 120,000 people and the Ford Dagenham automobile factory. Parrish Cottages remained largely untouched: electricity was not installed until the 1950s, and even then only with the reluctant approval of Ramsey's mother, who, according to a neighbour, was frightened of it. In the recollection of a childhood contemporary, Phil Cairns, the Ramsey house was [...] "little more than a wooden hut".|$|E

50|$|In Electoral Palatinate times, {{handicrafts}} and <b>smallhold</b> agriculture deﬁned the town’s economic structure. The {{greater part}} of Wolfstein’s inhabitants lived in poverty. In the late 18th century, improvement came with the mining of cinnabar-bearing stone that yielded quicksilver on the Princely-Electoral side of the Königsberg, a pursuit promoted by Prince-Elector Karl Theodor. Under the leadership brought by experienced professionals {{who had come to}} town, this mining reached its highest point between 1770 and 1790. Nevertheless, the mining lasted no longer than 30 years before coming to a complete end in the 19th century, with destitution and hardship as the upshot for the now jobless miners and their families.|$|R
50|$|Many economists {{believe that}} the CAP is {{unsustainable}} in the enlarged EU. The inclusion of ten additional countries on 1 May 2004 has obliged the EU to take measure to limit CAP expenditure. Poland is the largest new member and has two million <b>smallhold</b> farmers. It is significantly larger {{than any of the}} other new members, but taken together the new states represent a significant increase in recipients under the CAP. Even before expansion, the CAP consumed a very large proportion of the EU's budget. Considering that a small proportion of the population, and relatively small proportion of the GDP comes from farms, many considered this expense excessive.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{consensus}} on what the optimal strategy for land use in Africa may be. Studies by the National Academy of Sciences have suggested great promise in relying on native crops {{as a means to}} improving Africa's food security. A report by Future Harvest suggests that traditionally used forage plants show the same promise. Supporting a different viewpoint is an article appearing in AgBioForum which suggests that <b>smallhold</b> farmers benefited substantially by planting a genetically modified variety of maize. In a similar vein is an article discussing the use of nontraditional crops for export published as part of the proceedings of a Purdue University symposium.|$|R

50|$|A main {{criticism}} {{of the effects of}} the Green Revolution is the rising costs for many small farmers using HYV seeds, with their associated demands of increased irrigation systems and pesticides. A case study is found in India, where farmers are planting cotton seeds capable of producing Bt toxin. A criticism regarding the Green Revolution are the effects regarding the widespread commercialization and market share of organisations, particularly of the phasing out of seed saving practices in favor of purchasing of seeds, and concerns regarding the financial affordability of the adoption of patented crops amongst farmers, particularly of those in the developing world.This can allow larger farms, even foreign owned farming operations, to buy up local <b>smallhold</b> farms.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the place}} setting became popular around 1700, people brought their own spoons to the table, {{carrying}} {{them in the}} same way that people today carry wallet and keys. In pre-modern times, ownership of a silver spoon was an indication of social class, denoting membership in the land-owning classes. In the Middle Ages, when farmers and craftsmen worked long hours and frequently got dirt under their fingernails, it was important to not be mistaken for a serf or escaped slave. Under these circumstances, a silver spoon served the functional equivalent of passport, driving licence, and credit card. Since most members of the land-owning classes were <b>smallhold</b> farmers and craftsmen, the silver spoon was primarily a lower-middle-class cultural marker.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} report argues {{that during the}} colonial period the socially acceptable standard living of the smallholder was fundamentally altered. The operation of the <b>smallhold</b> farm unit changed primarily in six areas. These are: 1) food security and consumer goods; 2) changed relations of production on the smallholder plot; 3) customary law and land tenure; 4) wage labour; 5) social differentiation; 6) the long term price elasticity of coffee production. Smallholders were not completely "captured" and proletarianized but neither did they correspond to Hyden's version of an "uncaptured peasantry". This is primarily because they now required certain goods and services from outside the peasant mode of production as a necessary link in their social reproduction...|$|R
2500|$|The Board of Agriculture was {{established}} by Act of Parliament in 1889. [...] Although rationing during the First World War {{was limited to the}} end of 1917 and 1918, a change of mood arose about food security, and the Ministry of Food was created in 1916. [...] There was a national feeling that a man who had fought for his country should be entitled to retire to a <b>smallholding</b> on British land that would provide him with a livelihood. [...] This led to various initiatives, collectively called Homes for Heroes. [...] By 1926 agricultural law had become openly redistributive in favour of ex-servicemen. County Councils had compulsory purchase powers to requisition land they could let as smallholdings. [...] Ex-servicemen were the preferred tenants. [...] The tenant could then buy the land and could ask the Council to lend them money to fund the purchase as a mortgage.

In a speech to German colonists, Arthur Greiser said: [...] "In ten years there will not even be a peasant <b>smallholding</b> which {{will not be in}} German hands". In the Wartheland, the Nazi goal was complete Germanization. The formerly Polish territories were to become politically, culturally, socially, and economically German. The Nazis closed elementary schools where Polish was the language taught. Streets and cities were renamed (Łódź became Litzmannstadt, etc.). Tens of thousands of Polish enterprises from large industrial firms to small shops, were seized without payment to the owners. Signs posted in public places warned: [...] "Entrance forbidden for Poles, Jews, and dogs." [...] The forced resettlement affected two million Poles. In the severe winter of 1939–40 families were made to leave behind almost everything without any recompense. As part of Operation Tannenberg alone, 750,000 Polish peasants were forced out of their homes which were levelled, and the land given to German colonists and servicemen. A further 330,000 were murdered.|$|E
2500|$|A few Black Country {{places such}} as Wolverhampton, Bilston and Wednesfield are {{mentioned}} in Anglo-Saxon charters and chronicles and the forerunners {{of a number of}} Black Country towns and villages such as Cradley, Dudley, Smethwick, and Halesowen are included in the Domesday Book of 1086. At this early date, the area was mostly rural. A monastery was founded in Wolverhampton in the Anglo-Saxon period and a castle and priory was built at Dudley during the period of Norman rule. Another religious house, Premonstratensian Abbey of Halesowen, was founded in the early 13th century. A number of Black Country villages developed into market towns and boroughs in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, notably Dudley, Walsall and Wolverhampton. Coal mining was carried out for several centuries in the Black Country, starting from medieval times, and metalworking was important in the Black Country area as early as the 16th century spurred on by the presence of iron ore and coal in a seam [...] thick, the thickest seam in Great Britain, which outcropped in various places. Many people had an agricultural <b>smallholding</b> and supplemented their income by working as nailers or smiths, an example of a phenomenon known to economic historians as proto-industrialisation and by the 1620s [...] "Within ten miles [...] of Dudley Castle there were 20,000 smiths of all sorts".|$|E
40|$|Soil {{fertility}} depletion is recognised as {{a leading}} cause of food insecurity in subSaharan Africa and several approaches are being tested to replenish the fertility of degraded soils. A particular challenge is to develop products formulated for the needs of <b>smallhold</b> farmers who are directly affected by continuous food shortages. These products could be distributed through local farm input supply networks. Thus the Phosphate Rock Evaluation Project (PREP) at Moi University, Kenya, has formulated and field-tested a product, the PREP-PAC, which is an inexpensive product that combines fertilizer, legume seed and rhizobial inoculant techniques, from the University of Nairobi. It is specifically targeted to the low soil fertility patches that are widespread to <b>smallhold</b> farms in the highly weathered and leached soils of Western Kenya, consisting of about 500, 000 hectares of mainly Acrisols (Ultisols) and ferralsols (oxisols) and their mixtures. PREP-PAC contains of 2 kg of the reactive/biogenic locally available Minjingu (Tanzania) rock phosphate (PR), 0. 2 kg imported urea, 0. 13 kg seed of a N-fixing food legume, rhizobial inoculant (Biofix), seed adhesive (gum arabic), lime pellets and instruction sheet for use in English, Kiswahili and other local languages. The pack is assembled at US$ 0. 58 per unit and is intended to meliorate of 25 m. The product is particularly effective in acid (pH < 5. 5) and low P (10 mgP kg soils. In PREP-PAC testing in the field, several experiments were conducted form 1998 to date.

The gem {{industry}} was once again {{the basis of the}} local economy, as well as full employment in all other fields of business. Ethnic Germans driven out of Germany’s former eastern territories sought housing and work in Hettenrodt, too, as they did throughout Germany. This need for housing kept growing. In 1952, the municipality built a house in which four refugee families found shelter. In 1953, two Schwedensiedlungen (“Sweden settlements”; so-called because the wooden houses had been donated by the Swedish government) were built on the village’s outskirts, and two refugee families who had been driven out of their land moved in. These two new centres and a third one built in 1960 took the meadows and fields forsaken by <b>smallhold</b> farmers and put them to work. The village’s appearance changed quickly. Barn gates, which in the late 1940s were to be seen on almost every house, were replaced with garage doors; stables and barns became modern dwellings.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of most index-based {{insurance}} {{programs is}} {{to act as}} a social security mechanism and to provide defense against social and financial exclusion for people whose existing coping strategies are failing. For such schemes, insurance payouts do not depend on the individual losses but on an index which serves as a proxy for the losses.

Furthermore, distinguishing between a promotion as well as protection level within such schemes is beneficial from a supply as well as demand side perspective and we suggest an approach how both can be simultaneously introduced within a remote sensing index based insurance framework. The applicability and usefulness of the approach is tested for <b>smallhold</b> farmers in North Shewa, Ethiopia.
