40|$|Background: The {{efficacy}} of hair loss prevention by <b>scalp</b> cooling to prevent chemotherapy induced hair loss {{has been shown}} to be related to <b>scalp</b> skin temperature. <b>Scalp</b> skin temperature, however, is dependent not only on local cooling but also on the thermal status of the body. Objectives: This study was conducted to investigate the effect of body temperature on <b>scalp</b> skin temperature. Methods: We conducted experiments in which 13 healthy subjects consumed ice slurry to lower body temperature for 15 minutes after the start of <b>scalp</b> cooling and then performed two 12 -minute cycle exercise sessions to increase body core temperature. Esophageal temperature (T es), rectal temperature (T re), mean skin temperature (eight locations, T skin), and mean <b>scalp</b> temperature (five locations, T <b>scalp)</b> were recorded. Results: During the initial 10 minutes of <b>scalp</b> cooling, T <b>scalp</b> decreased by > 15 °C, whereas T es decreased by 0. 2 °C. After ice slurry ingestion, T es, T re, and T skin were 35. 8, 36. 5, and 31. 3 °C, respectively, and increased after exercise to 36. 3, 37. 3, and 33. 0 °C, respectively. T <b>scalp</b> was significantly correlated to T es (r = 0. 39, P es corresponded to an increase of 1. 6 °C in T <b>scalp.</b> Conclusions: Slight cooling of patients with an elevated body temperature during <b>scalp</b> cooling contributes to the decrease in <b>scalp</b> temperature and may improve the prevention of hair loss. This may be useful if the desired decrease of <b>scalp</b> temperature cannot be obtained by <b>scalp</b> cooling systems...|$|R
40|$|Many {{people feel}} {{frequent}} prickling or itching sensations on their <b>scalp.</b> The <b>scalp</b> is an atypical {{area of the}} skin since it is normally covered with thick hair and has many sebaceous glands and sweat glands. The <b>scalp</b> often has skin problems that can affect its sensitivity and functions. However, not much is known about stratum corneum function and the neural sensitivity of the <b>scalp.</b> Here we evaluated stratum corneum function and the neural sensitivity of the <b>scalp</b> of 47 normal male individuals in various skin conditions and compared the results to that to the forehead. The neural sensitivity was evaluated by measuring the electrical current perception threshold (CPT). The cutaneous barrier function and stratum corneum moisture-retention ability (MRA) of the <b>scalp</b> were significantly lower than on the forehead, {{even if there were}} some <b>scalp</b> problems. Depending on the increase in severity of <b>scalp</b> skin problems, both these skin functional properties and the CPT decreased significantly. However, regardless of its lower functional properties, <b>scalp</b> skin was not significantly lower than that of the forehead. Although the <b>scalp</b> has a low stratum corneum function compared with the forehead and has easily induced skin problems, the <b>scalp</b> skin has less sensitive sensory nerves, resulting in experiencing a worsening of <b>scalp</b> symptoms more easily...|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the ticket}} {{reselling}} {{that occurred during the}} week after the Super Bowl, and in order to limit that kind of profiteering, Hawaii Senate President Donna Mercado Kim introduced Senate Resolution 12, also known as the Bruno Mars Act. It limits all ticket purchases within 48 hours of the on-sale date to the physical box office. This ensures that anyone who comes to the box office to buy tickets for a show should almost certainly be guaranteed a ticket and discourages ticket <b>scalping.</b> The State Senate in Hawaii passed the law.|$|E

5|$|The second {{leg of the}} tour, {{comprising}} 25 arena {{shows in}} Europe from May to June 1992, was announced on 30 April. Ticketing details were kept secret until radio advertisements announced that tickets had gone on sale at box offices.

5|$|Federal {{and state}} {{officials}} became concerned about ticket <b>scalping</b> and fraud related to sales of the tickets for the swearing-in ceremony. Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, introduced legislation in mid-November 2008 to ban sales of tickets to the swearing-in ceremony. At the same time, the joint congressional committee contacted online auction operators, ticket resellers and classified listing services to block sales of the tickets. To address the committee's concerns, StubHub and eBay agreed to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony on all of its sites. Senator Feinstein re-introduced legislation in December 2008 to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony after amending the bill to exempt tickets issued by official presidential inaugural committees for inaugural event fundraising. The U.S.Senate failed to pass the final bill, which caused the bill {{to die in the}} closing days of the lame duck legislative session.|$|E
5|$|From April, Marquis began {{collecting}} artifacts of the Custer battle. He visited Cheyennes to buy objects {{that had been}} taken from the dead soldiers, particularly weapons. According to Weist, the fact that the Cheyennes would even admit that they had these objects was a measure of the trust Marquis had earned. Marquis also collected Cheyenne objects, including <b>scalping</b> knives. After attending the annual Sun Dance in Lame Deer, Marquis moved to Hardin, somewhat closer to the Custer battlefield. Marquis' presence at that Sun Dance, and at others held in subsequent years until 1931, was another measure of the Cheyennes' trust. The Sun Dance (called by the Cheyenne the Great Medicine dance) had earlier been made illegal by the Federal Government; 1927 was the first year they had been allowed to hold it openly. It was still disapproved of, and practicing Indian medicine was a jailable offense.|$|E

40|$|With modern <b>scalp</b> cooling {{equipment}} cytotoxic damage of hair root cells {{can be prevented}} in half of the patients with cancer {{at high risk of}} alopecia. However, traditionally doubt has existed whether <b>scalp</b> cooling might facilitate hiding and disseminating <b>scalp</b> skin metastases and thus decrease survival. We discuss this risk using frequency data on metastases in breast cancer from observational and autopsy studies and the Munich cancer registry. They showed the incidence of <b>scalp</b> skin metastases to be very low and not differ between scalp-cooled (0. 04 – 1 %) and non scalp-cooled (0. 03 – 3 %) patients with breast cancer and in need of chemotherapy. We found it rather unlikely that the incidence of <b>scalp</b> skin metastases might increase at all after <b>scalp</b> cooling, whereas a very small proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy are at risk to develop metastases at this site. <b>Scalp</b> cooling can thus safely be offered to patients treated with alopecia-inducing chemotherapy.

5|$|After {{reaching}} Lawrence, {{the guerrillas}} immediately killed {{a number of}} Union Army recruits and one of Anderson's men took their flag. The Provost Marshal of Kansas, a Union captain who commanded military police, surrendered to the guerrillas and Anderson took his uniform. (Guerrillas often wore uniforms stolen from Union soldiers.) They proceeded to pillage and burn many buildings, killing almost every man they found, but {{taking care not to}} shoot women. Anderson personally killed 14 people. Although some men begged him to spare them, he persisted, but he relented when a woman pleaded with him not to torch her house. The guerrillas under Anderson's command, notably including Archie Clement and Frank James, killed more {{than any of the other}} group. They left town at 9a.m., after a company of Union soldiers approached the town. The raiding party was pursued by Union forces, but eventually managed to break contact with the soldiers and scatter into the Missouri woods. After a dead raider was scalped by a Union-allied Lenape Indian during the pursuit, one guerrilla leader pledged to adopt the practice of <b>scalping.</b>|$|E
5|$|Montcalm, before {{agreeing to}} these terms, {{tried to make}} sure that his Indian allies {{understood}} them, and that the chiefs would undertake to restrain their men. This process was complicated by the diversity within the Indian camp, which included some warriors who spoke languages not understood by any European present. The British garrison was then evacuated from the fort to the entrenched camp, and Monro was quartered in the French camp. The Indians then entered the fort and plundered it, butchering some of the wounded and sick that the British had left behind. The French guards posted around the entrenched camp were only somewhat successful at keeping the Indians out of that area, and it took much effort to prevent plunder and <b>scalping</b> there. Montcalm and Monro initially planned to march the prisoners south the following morning, but after seeing the Indian bloodlust, decided to attempt the march that night. When the Indians became aware that the British were getting ready to move, a large number of them massed around the camp, causing the leaders to call off the march until morning.|$|E
5|$|Native scouts {{found about}} 500 Comanches, {{including}} Buffalo Hump, camped outside a Wichita village in Indian Territory. Early in the battle, Ross {{and his men}} successfully stampeded the Comanche horses, leaving the Comanche warriors at a disadvantage when facing the mounted troops. When many Comanche tried to flee the area, Ross, one of his scouts, Lieutenant Cornelius Van Camp of the 2nd Cavalry {{and one of his}} troopers chased a party of noncombatants that appeared to contain a white child. On Ross's orders, his man grabbed the child; as the four turned to rejoin the battle, they were confronted by 25 Comanche warriors. Van Camp and the private were killed with arrows, and Ross received an arrow through his shoulder. A Comanche picked up the trooper's carbine and fired a 0.58-caliber bullet through Ross's chest. His attacker, Mohee, was a Comanche brave Ross had known since childhood. Mohee was killed by buckshot fired by Lieutenant James Majors of the 2nd Cavalry as the warrior approached the temporarily paralyzed Ross with a <b>scalping</b> knife.|$|E

5|$|The Ho-Chunks and Potawatomis, {{who took}} part in the war, were sometimes, {{motivated}} by grievances, not directly related to Black Hawk's objectives. One such incident was the Indian Creek massacre. In the spring of 1832, Potawatomis living along Indian Creek were upset that a settler named William Davis had dammed the creek, preventing fish from reaching their village. Davis ignored the protests, and assaulted a Potawatomi man who tried to dismantle the dam. The Black Hawk War provided the Indian Creek Potawatomis with an opportunity for revenge. On May 21, about fifty Potawatomis and three Sauks from the British Band attacked Davis's settlement, killing, <b>scalping,</b> and mutilating fifteen men, women, and children. Two teenage girls from the settlement were kidnapped and taken to Black Hawk's camp. A Ho-Chunk chief named White Crow negotiated their release two weeks later. Like other Rock River Ho-Chunks, White Crow was trying to placate the Americans while clandestinely aiding the British Band.|$|E
5|$|On July 23, 1864, Anderson led 65 men to Renick, Missouri, robbing {{stores and}} tearing down {{telegraph}} wires on the way. They {{had hoped to}} attack a train, but its conductor learned of their presence and turned back before reaching the town. The guerrillas then attacked Allen, Missouri. At least 40 members of the 17th Illinois Cavalry and the Missouri State Militia were in town but took shelter in a fort. The guerrillas were only able to shoot their horses before reinforcements arrived, killing three of Anderson's men. In late July, the Union military sent a force of 100 well-equipped soldiers, and 650 other men, after Anderson. On July 30, Anderson and his men kidnapped the elderly father of the local Union militia's commanding officer. They tortured him until he was near death and sent word to the man's son in an unsuccessful attempt to lure him into an ambush, before releasing the father with instructions to spread word of his mistreatment. On August 1, while searching for militia members, Anderson {{and some of his}} men stopped at a house full of women and requested food. While they rested at the house, a group of local men attacked. The guerrillas quickly forced the attackers to flee, and Anderson shot and injured one woman as she fled the house. This action angered his men, who saw themselves as the protectors of women, but Anderson dismissed their concerns, stating that such things were inevitable. They chased the men who had attacked them, killing one and mutilating his body. By August 1864, they were regularly <b>scalping</b> the men that they killed.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{success of}} <b>scalp</b> cooling in {{preventing}} or reducing chemotherapy induced alopecia (CIA) is highly variable between patients undergoing similar chemotherapy regimens. A decrease of the <b>scalp</b> skin temperature {{seems to be}} an important factor, but data on the optimum temperature reached by <b>scalp</b> cooling to prevent CIA are lacking. This study investigated the relation between <b>scalp</b> skin temperature and its efficacy to prevent CIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this explorative study, <b>scalp</b> skin temperature was measured during <b>scalp</b> cooling in 62 breast cancer patients undergoing up to six cycles of anthracycline containing chemotherapy. <b>Scalp</b> skin temperature was measured by using two thermocouples at both temporal sides of the head. The primary end-point was the need for a wig or other head covering. RESULTS: Maximal cooling was reached after 45 min and was continued for 90 min after chemotherapy infusion. The <b>scalp</b> skin temperature after 45 min cooling varied from 10 degrees C to 31 degrees C, resulting in a mean <b>scalp</b> skin temperature of 19 degrees C (SEM: 0, 4). Intrapersonal <b>scalp</b> skin temperatures during cooling were consistent for each chemotherapy cycle (ANOVA: P = 0, 855). Thirteen out of 62 patients (21 %) did not require a wig or other head covering. They appeared to have a significantly lower mean <b>scalp</b> skin temperature (18 degrees C; SEM: 0, 7) compared to patients with alopecia (20 degrees C; SEM: 0, 5) (P = 0, 01). CONCLUSION: The efficacy of <b>scalp</b> cooling during chemotherapy is temperature dependent.
