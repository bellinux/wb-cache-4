500|$|For crowd scenes, CIS {{supplemented}} the live-action extras {{with digital}} pedestrians created using motion capture. House of Moves captured {{the movements of}} five men and four women during a two-day shoot supervised by Hancock. The motion capture performers were coached to make the [...] "small, formal and refined" [...] movements that Owens said reflected the general public's conduct at the time. CIS combined the motion data with the Massive software package to generate the interactions of the digital pedestrians. The use of Massive presented a challenge {{when it came to}} blending digital pedestrians with live-action extras who had to move from the foreground into the digital crowd. Massive worked well until this stage, when the effects team had to move the digital pedestrians to avoid taking the live-action extras out of the shot. To allow close-ups of individual Massive extras, the effects team focused on their faces and walking characteristics. Hancock explained, [...] "We {{wanted to be able to}} push Massive right up to the camera and see how well it held up. In a couple of shots the characters might be 40 feet away from the camera, about 1/5 <b>screen</b> <b>height.</b> The bigger the screen is, the bigger the character. He could be 10 feet tall, so everything, even his hair, better look good!" [...] Typically, a limited number of motion performances are captured and Massive is used to create further variety, such as in height and walking speed. Because the digital extras were required to be close to the foreground, and to integrate them properly with the live action extras, House of Moves captured twice as much motion data than CIS had used on any other project. CIS created nine distinct digital characters. To eliminate inaccuracies that develop when creating a digital extra of different proportions to the motion capture performer, CIS sent nine skeleton rigs to House of Moves before work began. This gave House of Moves time to properly adapt the rigs to its performers, resulting in motion capture data that required very little editing in Massive. CIS wrote shaders for their clothing; displacement maps in the air shader were linked with the motion capture to animate wrinkles in trousers and jackets.|$|E

The calculated results are compared with corresponding ones for two-dimensional situations, by using the substitute-sources method (SSM) also. The two and three-dimensional calculations give very similar results, which indicates that, for a large variety of situations, only two-dimensional models are needed.

As such, it rendered {{characters in a}} box of 9&times;14 pixels, of which 7&times;11 made out the character itself (the other pixels being used for space between character columns and lines). This amounted to markedly clearer text display than the competing CGA adapter could offer. The total theoretical resolution of this text mode was 720&times;350 pixels. This number is arrived at through multiplying the character width of 9 pixels {{by the number of}} text columns possible on screen (80) as well as multiplying the character height of 14 pixels by the number of text lines (25). In the MDA-compatible text mode, however, these pixels were not individually addressable. The graphics mode simply made all pixels directly addressable.

5000|$|The {{resolution}} of the human eye (with 20/20 vision) is about one minute of arc. For full HDTV resolution, this one minute of arc implies that the TV watcher should sit 4 times the <b>height</b> of the <b>screen</b> away.

So the ideal set size can be determined from the chart below by measuring the distance from where the watcher would sit to the screen in centimeters (or inches), dividing that by 4, and comparing with the <b>screen</b> <b>heights</b> below. Do {{not be surprised if}} the observer can see the pixels at this viewing distance as most normal people see far better than 6/6 (vision).

Coincident observations of the display were made from 23. 55 UT until 00. 50 UT. By projecting {{the image of the}} noctilucent cloud structure as seen by one camera into the field of view of the other camera, the height of the clouds was found to be 82 ± 1 km. Using this result, the effect of atmospheric screening on the visible border of the noctilucent clouds was determined. Taking account of the refraction on the solar grazing rays illuminating the clouds at the visible border and the finite angular diameter of the sun 2 ̆ 7 s disc, the altitude of the screening layer was determined to be 7 ± 1 km. Thus, on this occasion, the screening effect of the atmosphere was confined to the troposphere and was probably caused by atmospheric haze and/or tropospheric cloud. This result contrasts markedly with the high values of <b>screening</b> <b>height,</b> 30 km, deduced from measurements made earlier this century, also using the visible boundary of the clouds.

50|$|Some {{graphics}} card drivers have historically coped poorly with the EDID, using only its standard timing descriptors rather than its Detailed Timing Descriptors (DTDs). Even {{in cases where the}} DTDs were read, the drivers are/were still often limited by the standard timing descriptor limitation that the horizontal/vertical resolutions must be evenly divisible by 8. This means that many {{graphics card}}s cannot express the native resolutions of the most common wide screen flat panel displays and liquid crystal display televisions. The number of vertical pixels is calculated from the horizontal resolution and the selected aspect ratio. To be fully expressible, the size of wide screen display must thus be a multiple of 16×9 pixels. For 1366×768 pixel Wide XGA panels the nearest resolution expressible in the EDID standard timing descriptor syntax is 1360×765 pixels, typically leading to 3 pixel thin black bars.

Elevated BMI was associated with a lower risk of PCa, regardless of grade. Contrastingly, abdominal obesity, when adjusted for BMI, yielded results in the opposite direction. Taken together, our observations suggest that the specific body fat distribution (abdominal), for a given BMI, is a predictor of PCa risk, whereas BMI alone is not.

The deviations in insertion loss between the different calculation methods was at most 2 dB but the results for the increased barrier height showed that a higher insertion loss could be achieved.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of <b>height</b> <b>screening</b> (of children aged 4 to 11) to identify height-related conditions. DESIGN: Systematic review and economic modelling. SETTING AND INTERVENTION: We included published and unpublished screening studies of any design, except case reports, conducted in any setting that measured children's height {{as part of}} a population-level assessment. Studies were identified by electronic database searches, contact with experts and from bibliographies of retrieved studies. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged between 4 and 11 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic yield of height-related conditions and change in quality of life, as measured by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), for early versus late treatment of underlying conditions. RESULTS: Twelve studies described a height-screening programme and provided data on the diagnostic yield of newly diagnosed height-related conditions. Where reported, yield for growth-hormone deficiency (per 1000 children screened) ranged from 0. 05 (1 in 20, 000) to 0. 62 (approximately 1 in 1500) and for Turner syndrome (per 1000 children screened) was between 0. 02 (1 in 50, 000) and 0. 07 (approximately 1 in 14, 000). As a secondary gain, children with other potentially treatable conditions were identified; diagnostic yields ranged from 0. 22 to 1. 84 per 1000 children screened. Three studies did not detect any new cases, but all of these studies had methodological limitations. Economic modelling suggested that <b>height</b> <b>screening</b> is associated with health improvements and is cost effective for a willingness to pay threshold of pound 30, 000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates the utility and acceptable cost-effectiveness of <b>height</b> <b>screening</b> arising from increased detection of height-related disorders and secondary pick-up of other undiagnosed conditions. Further research is needed to obtain more reliable data on quality of life gains and costs associated with early interventions for height-related conditions.
