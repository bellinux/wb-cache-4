5|$|Achebe's third book, Arrow of God, was {{published}} in 1964. Like its predecessors, it explores the intersections of Igbo tradition and European Christianity.

Shocked by the power of British intervention in the area, he orders his <b>son</b> <b>to</b> learn the foreigners' secret.

5|$|As Crown Prince Cảnh {{had died}} of {{smallpox}} during {{the war against the}} Tây Sơn, it was assumed that Cảnh's son would succeed Gia Long, but in 1816 Nguyễn Phúc Đảm, the son of Gia Long's second wife, was appointed instead. Gia Long chose him for his strong character and his deeply conservative aversion to Westerners, whereas Cảnh's lineage had converted to Catholicism and had shunned Confucian traditions such as ancestor worship. Gia Long told his <b>son</b> <b>to</b> treat the Europeans—especially the French—respectfully, but not to grant them any position of preponderance.|$|E
5|$|Aurelian, {{learning}} about Zenobia's departure, sent a contingent which captured the queen {{before she could}} cross the Euphrates to Persia; Palmyra capitulated soon after news of Zenobia's captivity reached the city in August 272. Aurelian sent the queen and her <b>son</b> <b>to</b> Emesa for trial, followed by most of Palmyra's court elite (including Longinus). According to the Augustan History and Zosimus, Zenobia blamed her actions on her advisers; however, there are no contemporary sources describing the trial, only later hostile Roman ones. The queen's reported cowardice in defeat was probably Aurelian's propaganda; it benefited the emperor to paint Zenobia as selfish and traitorous, discouraging the Palmyrenes from hailing her as a hero. Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he spared the queen and her <b>son</b> <b>to</b> parade her in his planned triumph.|$|E

According to the memoirs of Charles Frederick's son, Charles Edward Horn, John Wolfgang wished for his <b>son</b> <b>to</b> become a surveyor.

5|$|Cibber and Katherine had 12 {{children}} between 1694 and 1713. Six died in infancy, {{and most of}} the surviving children received short shrift in his will. Catherine, the eldest surviving daughter, married Colonel James Brown and seems to have been the dutiful one who looked after Cibber in old age following his wife's death in 1734. She was duly rewarded at his death with most of his estate. His middle daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, went into business. Anne had a shop that sold fine wares and foods, and married John Boultby. Elizabeth had a restaurant near Gray's Inn, and married firstly Dawson Brett, and secondly (after Brett's death) Joseph Marples. His only <b>son</b> <b>to</b> reach adulthood, Theophilus, became an actor at Drury Lane, and was an embarrassment to his father because of his scandalous private life. His other <b>son</b> <b>to</b> survive infancy, James, died in or after 1717 before reaching adulthood.
