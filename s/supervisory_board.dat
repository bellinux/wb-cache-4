5|$|A {{supplementary}} {{member of}} the Storting, he met in the parliament once, acting as secretary for the constitution committee. During 1839–57, he was a {{member of the}} <b>supervisory</b> <b>board</b> of Norges Bank. He became a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 1821, and was its secretary from 1825 to 1831. Having a profound wish to spread erudition in Norway, he used his acquaintances in England to supply the society with enlightenment books and journals. Knudtzon eventually bequeathed his entire book collection and five of Thorvaldsen's sculptures to the society, with the condition that they not move to Christiania.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{two-tier system}} the SE is managed by a {{management}} board. The member {{or members of}} the management board {{have the power to}} represent the company in dealings with third parties and in legal proceedings. They are appointed and removed by the <b>supervisory</b> <b>board.</b> No person may be a member of both the management board and the <b>supervisory</b> <b>board</b> of the same company at the same time. But the <b>supervisory</b> <b>board</b> may appoint one of its members to exercise the functions of a member of the management board in the event of absence through holidays. During such a period the function of the person concerned {{as a member of the}} <b>supervisory</b> <b>board</b> shall be suspended.|$|E

40|$|Overcoming {{a crisis}} {{situation}} in which the socioemotional wealth (SEW) of a family is at risk can be threatened by a lack of formal crisis procedures, which can increase the probability of organizational decline. Thus, not being prepared for a crisis situation may be a critical factor in the long-term survival of family firms. From a corporate governance perspective, <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards</b> may achieve higher levels of crisis readiness. Applying the resourced-based view and SEW theory, we analyze the relationship between family ownership and formalized crisis procedures in 150 small and medium-sized German firms. Our results show that formalized crisis procedures decrease as family ownership increases. Including <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards</b> in our analysis, we find a significant moderating effect of <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards</b> on the relationship between family ownership and formalized crisis procedures. Specifically, our results suggest that family firms with <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards</b> show similar levels of formalized crisis procedures as non-family firms with <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards.</b> In contrast, family firms without <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards</b> exhibit lower levels of formalized crisis procedures compared with non-family firms without <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards.</b> We also discuss managerial implications, limitations, and future research...|$|R

40|$|Women {{are still}} in the clear {{minority}} among the financial sector's top decision-making bodies. According to DIW Berlin's Women Executives Barometer, at the end of 2016, 21 percent of the <b>supervisory</b> and administrative <b>board</b> members of the 100 largest banks were female. The number has stagnated compared to last year. Since 2010, when the discussion about the gender quota for <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards</b> gained momentum, growth has been relatively flat - particularly in comparison to the top 100 companies outside the financial sector. At insurance companies, the proportion of women on <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards</b> was a solid 22 percent (an increase of around three percentage points). This puts insurance companies ahead of banks {{for the first time since}} 2006. Also of note: companies whose <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards</b> contained one-third women were not able to increase this number in 2016. Extrapolating from the past decade, <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards</b> of banks would need 50 years for the ratio of women to men to be equal. Gender parity in executive boards would be reached in 80 years. The proportion of women on executive boards remained very low overall as it reached roughly ten percent at insurance companies and eight percent at banks...|$|R

40|$|At {{the end of}} 2014, {{women were}} no better {{represented}} on the top decision-making bodies of enterprises in the financial sector than the previous year. The share of women on the executive boards of the 100 largest banks and savings banks remained {{at an average of}} almost seven percent and on the executive boards of the 60 largest insurance companies at 8. 5 percent. On <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards,</b> change was slow at best: Although the share of women in financial institutions was almost 18 percent and a good 17 percent among insurance companies, only decimal point increases could be observed. In public sector banks and savings banks, however, female representation on <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards</b> was greater than in the previous year: at almost 19 percent, the financial institutions in this sector are roughly on a par with private banks (a good 18 percent). Overall, the majority of women on <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards</b> are still employee representatives but shareholders have appointed considerably more women to <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards</b> in recent years. At European level, relatively few women were represented on the Council of the European Central Bank and on decision-making bodies of the national central banks, although there are significant differences across countries. Planned legislation on the equal participation of women and men in leadership positions in the private and public sectors aims to increase the proportion of women on <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards</b> of listed companies subject to codetermination regulations in Germany. The persistence of current structures could be greater in the financial sector than in the top 200 companies: Even though over half of financial sector employees are women, the share of women on the <b>supervisory</b> <b>boards</b> of financial institutions increased on average by less than 0. 4 percentage points per year in the period 2006 to 2014, compared to 1. 3 percentage points in the top 200 companies...|$|R
