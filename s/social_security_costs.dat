Recognizing these conditions, {{the government is}} now examining a framework for maintaining fiscal sustainability, mainly at the Council of Economic and Fiscal Policy.

40|$|Our {{paper is}} an {{examination}} of the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> <b>cost</b> of smoking from an individual point of view. It is well known that smokers have a shorter life expectancy than nonsmokers. This means that by smoking they are giving up potential <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> benefits. We estimate this cost and consider the effects on the system as a whole. We use mortality ratios, which relate the annual death probabilities of smokers and nonsmokers, and the percentage of smokers in each age group to break down the life tables for men and women born in 1920 into the approximate life tables for smokers and nonsmokers. We then calculate expected <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> taxes and benefits for each group, using median earnings as a base. We find that smoking costs men about $ 20, 000 and women about $ 10, 000 in expected net benefits. The implication of this for the system as a whole is that the prevalence of smoking has a direct effect on the financial viability of the system; every {{decrease in the number of}} smokers in society increases the system's liability. Changes in smoking behavior should be recognized as affecting the system. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Norway has few {{specialists in}} {{geriatric}} medicine, but geriatric services {{are supposed to}} be implemented in all local hospitals. I assessed a model for hospital out-patient geriatric service headed by a general practitioner. The service was organised in a local hospital. 266 elderly patients were referred for geriatric assessment. Main outcome measures were ICD- 9 diagnostic categories, general patient well-being before and after assessment, patients' and referring doctors' satisfaction, and cost of the service and income received. Age, gender and diagnoses were within the same range as in other studies of out-patient geriatric assessment. Two hundred and three (85. 3 %) out of 238 patients reached in follow-up interviews were satisfied with the service and reported improved general well-being. Referring doctors reported satisfaction with the service. The service was financed by charges paid by the patients and a capitation fee from the <b>social</b> <b>security.</b> <b>Cost</b> per patient was £ 94 (1070 NOK). The study shows that in Norway a GP can implement an outpatient geriatric service which improves the patients' general well-being and is cost effective.

While Iran's population {{grew at a}} rate of more than 3% per year between 1956 and 1986, the growth rate began to decline in the late 1980s and early 1990s after the government initiated a major population control program.

Reports by the UN show birth control policies in Iran to be effective with the country topping the list of greatest fertility decreases. UN's Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs says that between 1975 and 1980, the total fertility number was 6.5. The projected level for Iran's 2005 to 2010 birth rate is fewer than two. As at 2012, more than half of Iran's population is under 35 years old.

These differences were clearly reflected in the different levels of technology, patterns of labour utilisation and indices of productivity and efficiency obtaining in the various agricultural sub-sectors.

40|$|Governments {{and policy}} makers {{throughout}} the developed world have exhorted employers {{for almost two decades}} to discourage early retirement and retain older workers because national economies cannot afford sudden and large increases in <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>costs.</b> The economic effect of the baby boomer cohort heading for retirement has long been recognised as having economic consequences which would be difficult to manage. So governments and academics set about attempting to convince business of the necessity of older worker retention. Until the global financial crisis, there was little evidence that workers or employers were responding to this call. The growing literature on older workers (OWs) has been dominated by demographic discussions and popular thought and conjecture. A small number have been case studies and empirical research, particularly in the area of employee retirement intentions and its corollary, the incentives needed to keep OWs at work. As research on this topic increases, there is little theory in the human resources area on which to base the value of older workers and the reasons to keep them in employment. It can be argued that a case of business value was not being made sufficiently strongly to employers (ironically the youth culture introduced by the baby boomers still predominates) while OWs were still infused with the culture of early retirement. 3 page(s...|$|E

Objective: To estimate {{the economic impact of}} CVD in Brazil {{in the last five years}}. Methods: The information to estimate CVD costs was taken from national databases, adding the direct costs with hospitalizations, outpatient visits and benefits granted by <b>social</b> <b>security.</b> Indirect <b>costs</b> were added to the calculation, such as loss of income caused by CVD morbidity or mortality. Results: CVD mortality accounts for 28 % of all deaths in Brazil in the last five years and for 38 % of deaths in the productive age range (18 to 65 years). The estimated costs of CVD were R$ 37. 1 billion in 2015, a 17 % increase in the period from 2010 to 2015. The estimated costs of premature death due to CVD represent 61 % of the total cost of CVD, Direct costs with hospitalizations and consultations were 22 %, and costs related to the loss of productivity related to the disease were 15 % of the total. Health expenditures in Brazil are estimated at 9. 5 % of GDP and the average cost of CVD was estimated at 0. 7 % of GDP. Conclusion: CVD costs have increased significantly in the last five years.

40|$|Regulators often {{attempt to}} socialize {{insurance}} costs by limiting premium differences between low and high-risk policyholders. Some insurance {{programs such as}} <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> socialize program <b>costs</b> through compulsory, non risk-based contributions {{for the vast majority}} of workers. Voluntary insurance markets, however, allow individuals or groups to opt out. Would-be insurance buyers can choose self-insurance or some alternative form of risk management if they believe they are being asked unfairly to subsidize others. The migration of low-risk policyholders from socialized insurance mechanisms ultimately causes these mechanisms to break down. This does not mean that socialization of insurance costs is impossible, but history provides some important lessons. The purpose of this paper is to look at some example in th historical record where efforts to socialize have clearly failed and explain why these efforts failed. Examples of socialization failures from the historical record include community rating by Blue Cross organizations in their early years (pre- 1950 s), assessment life insurance societies, and attempts at socialization of automobile insurance in Michigan. In one way or another, these methods of spreading risk across policyholders broke down once the market found mechanisms by which low-risk policyholders could avoid subsidizing high-risk insureds...|$|R
