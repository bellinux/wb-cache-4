The elastic capsule is subjected to the laser beam with Gaussian distribution in the perpendicular direction to the fluid flow. The elastic capsule migrated by the optical force along {{the direction of the}} laser beam propagation, and the migration distance is dependent on its properties. The oblate capsule with b/a = 0. 5 obeying the neo-Hookean constitutive law is first considered, and the effects of the <b>surface</b> <b>Young's</b> <b>modulus</b> and the initial inclination angle on the migration distance are studied. The migration distance of the oblate capsule is increased as the <b>surface</b> <b>Young's</b> <b>modulus</b> increases, and the non-inclined oblate capsule is more migrated than the differently inclined capsules. Then the spherical, oblate, and biconcave capsules obeying the Skalak constitutive law are considered. A comparison of the trajectories of the capsules indicates that the migration of the spherical capsule is the largest. Unlike the oblate capsule, the non-inclined biconcave capsule is less migrated than other inclination angles due to its initial shape...|$|R

40|$|The present work investigates {{contributions}} from surfaces and core nonlinearity to the size-dependent elastic properties of nanowires under bending and tension-compression. When a nanowire is formed by removing {{it from its}} parent bulk material, relaxation occurs inevitably because of high energy of newly created surfaces or born high surface eigenstress. Relaxation-induced initial strain could be large and nonlinear, which causes the size-dependent elastic properties of nanowires. If relaxation-induced initial strain is small and linear, the size-dependent elastic properties of nanowires are caused by <b>surface</b> <b>Young's</b> <b>modulus.</b> The eigenstress model for surface stress of solids { Zhang [Phys.

At present, 3 D-printed microfluidic systems typically utilize a relatively ‘stiff’ printing material such as ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymers), which limits the implementation of large mechanical actuation for active pumping and mixing as routinely carried out in a PDMS system. In this paper, we report the development of an active 3 D-printed microfluidic system with moving parts fabricated from a flexible thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). The 3 D-printed microfluidic system consists of two pneumatically actuated micropumps and one micromixer. The completed system was successfully applied to the detection of low-level insulin concentration using a chemiluminescence immunoassay, and the test result compares favorably with a similarly designed PDMS microfluidic system. Prior to system fabrication and testing, the material properties of TPE were extensively evaluated. The result indicated that TPE is compatible with biological materials and its 3 D-printed surface is hydrophilic as opposed to hydrophobic for a molded PDMS <b>surface.</b> The <b>Young’s</b> <b>modulus</b> of TPE is measured to be 16  MPa, which is approximately eight times higher than that of PDMS, but over one hundred times lower than that of ABS...|$|R
40|$|Silica aerogels were {{prepared}} via the sol–gel process using tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) as the precursor and polyethylene oxide (PEO) of molecular weights 10, 000 and 100, 000 {{to provide a}} polymeric template for gelation. The experiments included eleven different formulations ranging from 100 % 10, 000 MW PEO to 100 % 100, 000 MW PEO in 10 % increments. The total concentration of PEO was kept constant throughout the experiment. The gelation time of the wet-gel prepared using 10, 000 MW PEO was 15. 3 (± 0. 1) × 103 s, while gelation occurred almost 30 times faster by using long-chain 100, 000 MW PEO. The surface area of aerogels prepared with 10, 000 MW PEO was 40 m 2 g− 1 and that of 100, 000 MW PEO aerogels was more than {{an order of magnitude}} larger. The <b>Young’s</b> <b>modulus</b> of 10, 000 MW PEO aerogels was 1. 2 (± 0. 3) MPa while that for 100, 000 MW PEO aerogels was almost four times larger. Estimated pore sizes for all types of gels were in the macroporous region. The estimated pore sizes for 10, 000 MW PEO were an order of magnitude greater than those estimated for 100, 000 MW PEO. The physical properties of silica aerogels such as gelation time, pore size, <b>surface</b> area, and <b>Young’s</b> <b>modulus</b> can be tailored to make them suitable for application as separation media in HPLC and CEC...|$|R

The Macroscopic <b>Young’s</b> <b>Modulus</b> of granular packing rock layers is proportioned to the powers of 1 / 3 of the vertical contact force of sand particles. The Macroscopic <b>Young’s</b> <b>Modulus</b> is inversely proportional to particle diameter. The paper calculated the vertical contact force of five types aligning mode of the particles. When equal stress, the increased of the coordination number lead to the decrease of the contact force fn, this lead to the coordination number is an inverse proportion to Macroscopic <b>Young’s</b> <b>Modulus.</b> But the larger coordination number change only means very little Macroscopic <b>Young’s</b> <b>Modulus</b> change...|$|R
