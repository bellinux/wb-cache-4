25|$|Truffaut's final {{movie was}} shot in black and white. It gives his career almost a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> bookends. Confidentially Yours is Truffaut's tribute to his {{favorite}} director, Alfred Hitchcock. It deals with numerous Hitchcockian themes, such as private guilt vs. public innocence, a woman investigating a murder, anonymous locations, etc.|$|E
50|$|The name Spittal means 'hospital', {{most likely}} in the old <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>'a</b> place <b>of</b> lodging'. Before the {{existence}} of this hospital, the place was known as Rulemouth.|$|R

'Meinie' {{is the old}} English {{word for}} 'Many,' in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>'a</b> many' persons {{attending}} one, as bridesmaids, when in sixes or tens or dozens;--courtiers, footmen, and the like. It passes gradually into 'Menial,' and unites the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> Multitude and Servitude.|$|R

25|$|The {{history of}} Japanese poetry {{is tied to}} the history of Japanese literature, that is in the purely {{historical}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> extant written records. However, the early pre-history and mythology of Japan involve or include some references to poetry. And, the earliest preserved works in the Japanese language also preserve some previous poetry from this earlier period.|$|E
25|$|Hitchen {{regarded}} {{these matters}} so commonplace, so confident was he of his inviolability in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> official immunity, {{that he began}} to boast of controlling dozens of thieves. At the beginning of September, the Court of Aldermen was presented an array of complaints from different layers of society, notably, all of whom were victims of pickpockets.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{conversion}} {{was described in}} different ways, but most ministers agreed that there were 3 essential stages. The first stage was humiliation or sorrow for having sinned against God. The second stage was justification or adoption characterized by a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> been forgiven and accepted by God through Christ's mercy. The third stage was sanctification, the ability to live a holy life out of gladness toward God.|$|E

25|$|Problematic point(s): it is {{not always}} known whether a {{specific}} form is actually the official name of an institution, or what is its official name (e.g. whether the city of its location is part of the name). In addition, {{it is not}} always clear if a group is actually an institution in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> been registered at the court, with a statute, a stamp, letter header etc. on its own. A third problem is {{the question of whether the}} spelling of an organization can be corrected if it is not written according to the above rule. In addition, adjectival forms derived from institution names are also often mistaken because people feel the need to distinguish them from genuine common names (especially if the name contains a fancy name that becomes identical with a common name if written in lowercase). Furthermore, it is unclear why cinemas are treated differently (see above) from theatres, cf. Művész mozi, but Magyar Színház.|$|E
500|$|The {{term has}} also {{been used as a}} verb, with a {{character}} in television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer asking [...] "Does anyone else feel like they've been Keyser Söze'd?", referring to a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> been definitively manipulated and outmaneuvered.|$|E
500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{references}} to birds. Marion's last name is Crane and she is from Phoenix. Norman comments that Marion eats like a bird. The motel room has pictures of birds on the wall. Brigitte Peucker also suggests that Norman's hobby of stuffing birds literalizes the British slang expression for sex, [...] "stuffing birds", bird being a British slang for a desirable woman. Robert Allan suggests that Norman's mother is his original [...] "stuffed bird", both in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> preserved her body and the incestuous nature of Norman's emotional bond with her.|$|E

The following results were obtained: (1) High school students and those left high school, <b>having</b> strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> adaptiveness, <b>had</b> healthy lives and feelings. (2) Juvenile delinquents, <b>having</b> weak <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> adaptiveness, <b>had</b> unhealthy lives and feelings. (3) The other subjects had intermediate lives and feelings...|$|R
500|$|An {{obsession}} is an [...] "undesired, unpleasant, intrusive {{thought that}} cannot be suppressed through the patient's volition", but unlike passivity experiences described above, {{they are not}} experienced as imposed from outside the patient's mind. Obsessions are typically intrusive thoughts of violence, injury, dirt or sex, or obsessive ruminations on intellectual themes. A person can also describe obsessional doubt, with intrusive worries about whether they have made the wrong decision, or forgotten to do something, for example turn off the gas or lock the house. In obsessive-compulsive disorder, the individual experiences obsessions with or without compulsions (a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to carry out certain ritualized and senseless actions against their wishes).|$|E
500|$|In fact, Cobb has not {{shied away}} even from re-imaging {{what is now}} {{regarded}} as the “traditional” Christian notion of God. [...] He {{does not believe that}} God is omnipotent in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> unilateral control over all events, since Cobb sees reconciling total coercive power with love and goodness to be an impossible task. [...] Instead, all creatures are viewed as having some degree of freedom that God cannot override. [...] Cobb solves the problem of evil by denying God’s omnipotence, stressing instead that God’s power is persuasive rather than coercive, that God can influence creatures but not determine what they become or do. [...] For Cobb, God’s role is to liberate and empower.|$|E
500|$|... "Share My Love" [...] is an uptempo {{song with}} Philadelphia soul-styled strings. It has a pop-R style {{similar to that}} of Michael Jackson's 1979 album Off the Wall. The song has a theme of romance and tongue-in-cheek lyrics: [...] "Populate / Let's get {{together}} / Populate". [...] "Green Light" [...] has a quiet storm style and low-key mood. It is about a man wanting to please a woman who has a negligent boyfriend. [...] "Feelin' Single" [...] is about the [...] "liminal <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> checked out of a relationship and started looking around for escape routes." [...] Kelly sings in a high register on the song, which Greg Kot views [...] "evok the boyish innocence of a Michael Jackson over a stepping dance groove accented with finger snaps." ...|$|E
50|$|The NEIS (New Enterprise Initiative Scheme) is a {{government}} program in Australia, which assists unemployed people {{to start their own}} businesses.

500|$|Dylan was {{rethinking}} {{the direction of}} his life while recovering from a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> been exploited. Nine months after the crash, he told New York Daily News reporter Michael Iachetta, [...] "Songs are in my head like they always are. And they're not going to get written down until some things are evened up. Not until some people come forth and make up for {{some of the things that}} have happened." [...] After discussing the crash with Dylan, biographer Robert Shelton concluded that he [...] "was saying there must be another way of life for the pop star, in which he is in control, not they. He had to find ways of working to his own advantage with the recording industry. He had to come to terms with his one-time friend, longtime manager, part-time neighbor, and sometime landlord, Albert Grossman." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Pāli Canon, Gautama Buddha {{is known}} as being a [...] "teacher of the gods and humans", {{superior}} to both the gods and humans in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> nirvana or the greatest bliss, whereas the devas, or gods, are still subject to anger, fear and sorrow.|$|E
2500|$|To {{motivate the}} Born chart, we first {{consider}} {{the family of}} Langevin observers represented in an ordinary cylindrical coordinate chart for Minkowski spacetime. [...] The world lines of these observers form a timelike congruence which is rigid in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a vanishing expansion tensor. [...] They represent observers who rotate rigidly around an axis of cylindrical symmetry.|$|E
2500|$|In the aftermath, {{there was}} no {{conclusive}} assessment {{on the outcome of}} the clashes. Neil Melvin, director of the armed conflict and conflict management programme at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, stated that [...] "Azerbaijan suffered heavy losses for relatively minor territorial gains, this is nonetheless seen as a victory, after 25 years of a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> been defeated".|$|E
