PEITC was the most active of five different forms of isothiocyanate tested for their effects on in vitro proinflammatory gene expression.

We conclude that Barbarea verna <b>seed</b> <b>preparation</b> may function as a potent anti-inflammatory agent, interfering with the transcription of proinflammatory genes. Phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC) is an organosulfur bio-active compound present in many plants of the Brassicaceae family, most of which have long histories of human consump-tion. Of these, Barbarea verna (winter cress) is the richest source of PEITC (Ribnicky et al., 2001), with the highest levels formed in the seeds. Winter cress is an annual herb, mostly harvested as a seedling to add a peppery flavor to salads, sandwiches, soups, and garnishes. PEITC has many well documented cancer chemopreventive properties.

50|$|A {{prepared}} seedbed remains receptive for {{a relatively}} short period, seldom as long as 5 years, sometimes as short as 3 years. Seedbed receptivity on moist, fertile sites decreases with particular rapidity, and especially on such sites, <b>seedbed</b> <b>preparation</b> should be scheduled {{to take advantage of}} good seed years. In poor seed years, site preparation can be carried out on mesic and drier sites with more chance of success, because of the generally longer receptivity of seedbeds there than those on moister sites. Although an indifferent seed year can suffice if seed distribution is good and environmental conditions favourable to seedling germination and survival, small amounts of seed are particularly vulnerable to depredation by small mammals. Considerable flexibility is possible in timing site preparation to coincide with cone crops. Treatment can be apllied either before any logging takes place, between partial cuts, or after logging.
