5|$|While the Leslie {{speaker is}} still made and sold, similar effects {{can now be}} {{obtained}} via analogue electronic devices and digital emulation. Chorus and phase <b>shifter</b> devices can give an approximation of the sounds produced by a Leslie speaker. The Uni-Vibe, a four-stage phase <b>shifter,</b> was specifically marketed as a low-cost Leslie substitute for guitarists, and used a foot-operated fast/slow switch similar to the combo preamp. The pedal was popular, and notable users included Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour and Robin Trower, but vintage units tend {{not to be in}} good condition now due to the degradation of capacitors in the unit. Although the sound of a Leslie speaker heard in person is quite distinct, digital clones have become increasingly better at emulating it.|$|E
5|$|By {{making use}} of a new power {{obtained}} by Eren {{that allows him to}} create massive and permanent structures, the Survey Corps hold another expedition, this time managing to reach Shiganshina and seal the breach to reclaim Wall Maria. However, they are ambushed by Zeke, the man behind the Titan invasions and the spies, leading an army of Titans including the Colossal Titan against them. The battle ends with Zeke retreating, and the Colossal Titan defeated and killed by Armin, who became a Titan <b>Shifter</b> like Eren, but at the cost of the lives of almost {{all the members of the}} expedition, including the commander of the Survey Corps, Erwin Smith.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, Meshuggah {{undertook}} a short European tour organized by its record label Nuclear Blast. Afterwards, the band {{returned to the}} studio to record the album Destroy Erase Improve at Soundfront Studios in Uppsala, with Daniel Bergstrand as a producer. Shortly thereafter, the band went on a European tour supporting Machine Head for two months. During the tour, Nordin became ill and experienced difficulties with his inner ear balance. Due to the resulting chronic dizziness and vertigo, Nordin {{was forced to leave}} the tour and travel to Sweden. Machine Head's bassist Adam Duce offered to cover his absence; however, Meshuggah decided to continue as a four-piece. Sometimes Thordendal played bass, while other times the band performed with two guitars. In this lineup, Hagström would use a pitch <b>shifter</b> to play his guitar at an octave lower than usual.|$|E
50|$|The {{usage of}} true-time-delay TTD phase <b>shifters</b> instead of RF MEMS phase <b>shifters</b> allows UWB radar {{waveforms}} with associated high range resolution, and avoids beam squinting or frequency scanning. TTD phase <b>shifters</b> are designed using the switched-line principle or the distributed loaded-line principle. Switched-line TTD phase <b>shifters</b> outperform distributed loaded-line TTD phase <b>shifters</b> {{in terms of}} time delay per decibel NF, especially at frequencies up to X-band, but are inherently digital and require low-loss and high-isolation SPNT switches. Distributed loaded-line TTD phase <b>shifters,</b> however, can be realized analogously or digitally, and in smaller form factors, which is important at the subarray level. Analog phase <b>shifters</b> are biased through a single bias line, whereas multibit digital phase <b>shifters</b> require a parallel bus along with complex routing schemes at the subarray level.|$|R
50|$|After 11 years, {{the manual}} gearbox <b>shifters</b> would be {{replaced}} by newly-mandatory sequential semi-automatic gearbox paddle <b>shifters</b> respectively for all DTM cars to make easier shifting rather than manual <b>shifters.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{interpolation}} {{performed by}} the seven-tap or eight-tap interpolation filter (h_f or v_f in Fig.  5) is implemented by <b>shifters</b> and additions and subtraction operations. Based on (1) and (2), the 8 -tap filter needs 33 adders (12 adders for A type, 9 adders for B type, and 12 adders for C type) and 14 <b>shifters</b> (5 <b>shifters</b> for type A, 4 <b>shifters</b> for B type, and 5 <b>shifters</b> for C type) in the hardware implementation.|$|R
25|$|The four-speed gearbox was not {{bolted to}} the engine, but was a {{separate}} shaft-driven unit mounted between {{the second and third}} crossmembers. While the remote gearbox placement led to a complicated linkage to the column-mounted <b>shifter,</b> resulting in vague <b>shifter</b> action, it also improved legroom for the front passengers.|$|E

25|$|Interior trim also {{received}} minor revisions, and a bench seat with center armrest returned as a no-cost option {{to the standard}} Strato bucket seats and console. Bench seat-equipped Grand Prixs got a steering column-mounted <b>shifter</b> with the automatic transmission along with a dashboard-mounted glovebox, replacing the console-mounted <b>shifter</b> and glovebox of bucket-seat cars. Power front disc brakes became standard equipment this year.|$|E
25|$|Updates to the Caprice PPV for 2014 {{included}} the interior from the Commodore Evoke, with a column <b>shifter</b> replacing the floor <b>shifter</b> {{that was in}} the 2011-2013 models to make room for equipment and the 9C3 Unmarked/Detective version being discontinued. For 2015, the PPV gained the same rear vision camera as the Holden Caprice WN, Royale and SS models. No changes were announced for the 2016 model year.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{three different}} D-Band (110 – 170 GHz) phase <b>shifters</b> for high-bandwidth communication and radar applications. The proposed phase <b>shifters</b> offer phase shifts of 180 °, 90 ° and 45 ° and show only very little amplitudeand phase-error over the full D-Band. Furthermore {{based on the}} measurement results of the individual phase <b>shifters</b> the group factor of an eight element phased array system was calculated. The results were used to verify the suitability of such phase <b>shifters</b> as feeding elements in phased array systems. It is shown that these phase <b>shifters</b> are {{a good choice for}} high bandwidth systems and offer bandwidths between 25 and 50 GHz, depending on the maximum required tilt angle of the array...|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{the first}} generation, the {{interior}} was not as customizable in the second generation, and many options that were previously available were cut for 1992. The second generation now used only a single seat design shared with all models (the first generation LX got its own unique seat design), and was only available in two configurations; with a front bench seat and a column mounted <b>shifter,</b> or with front bucket seats and a center console with a floor mounted <b>shifter.</b> The console was a carryover from the first generation, although it was redesigned for 1993.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Electronically scanned arrays are {{required}} for space based radars {{that are capable of}} tracking multiple robots, rovers, or other assets simultaneously and for beam-hopping communication systems between the various assets. Traditionally, these phased array antennas used GaAs MMIC phase <b>shifters,</b> power amplifiers, and low noise amplifiers to amplify and steer the beam, but the development of RF MEMS switches {{over the past ten years}} has enabled system designers to consider replacing the GaAs MMIC phase <b>shifters</b> with RF MEMS phase <b>shifters.</b> In this paper, the implication of replacing the relatively high loss GaAs MMICs with low loss MEMS phase <b>shifters</b> is investigated...|$|R

50|$|Phased-array antennas {{use phase}} <b>shifters</b> that require {{adjustment}} {{after the end}} of the transmit pulse, and these phase <b>shifters</b> create modulation and high sidelobes that corrupts receive signals until after the setup time. Active phased-array radar may not have this limitation.|$|R
50|$|For {{integrated}} <b>shifters</b> on racing bicycles, {{the gear}} {{can be read}} by the computer: Shimano's Flight Deck and Campagnolo's ErgoBrain work with their respective systems to detect the gearing. This allows indirect measurement of cadence. These systems do not have sensors on the crankset or cassette to determine what gear the bicycle is in. They work exclusively with the <b>shifters,</b> which may result in misleading information. Instead of knowing what gear the bicycle is in, they rely on sensing when the cyclist changes gears using sensors in the <b>shifters.</b> If the gear change doesn't actually happen, or the computer's sensors are too sensitive (e.g.: when braking with STI-style <b>shifters),</b> the information displayed is not accurate.|$|R
