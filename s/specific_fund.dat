25|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 prompted {{a number of}} reforms in the eurozone. One was a u-turn on the eurozone's bailout policy {{that led to the}} creation of a <b>specific</b> <b>fund</b> to assist eurozone states in trouble. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) were created in 2010 to provide, alongside the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a system and fund to bail out members. However the EFSF and EFSM were temporary, small and lacked a basis in the EU treaties. Therefore, it was agreed in 2011 to establish a European Stability Mechanism (ESM) which would be much larger, funded only by eurozone states (not the EU as a whole as the EFSF/EFSM were) and would have a permanent treaty basis. As a result of that its creation involved agreeing an amendment to TEFU Article 136 allowing for the ESM and a new ESM treaty to detail how the ESM would operate. If both are successfully ratified according to schedule, the ESM would be operational by the time the EFSF/EFSM expire in mid-2013.|$|E

5000|$|Crowdfunding {{utilizes}} the “crowd” to gain needed {{funding for}} a product or cause instead of specialized donors. Crowdfunding typically enlists the use of social media such as Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn increasing the virality of a project {{to make it more}} successful. [...] In the scope of university crowdfunding, most donations go to a <b>specific</b> <b>fund</b> or cause, and because the money goes to supporting a larger nonprofit organization, many donations are tax-deductible. Because of the nature of university crowdfunding, its structure typically varies slightly from the usual crowdfunding campaign. Where a video game campaign might offer the donor early access to the game upon production, most university run projects {{do not have the same}} type of tangible product that someone is investing in that can be enjoyed. For that reason, university crowdfunding campaigns typically utilize giving levels or project-specific perks to incentivize their donors. Levels usually explain what the specific donation amount will do to help the project, whereas perks will offer individual recognition to the donor for their support to the cause.|$|E
50|$|In June 2010, it was {{unveiled}} that two reports, prepared in February 2010 before {{the capital injection}} had been approved, were opposed to the bailout. Made public by Finance Minister Charilaos Stavrakis on 10 June 2010, the two reports created a series of debates and rows with the island’s political parties, who felt they were misled into approving the money. The first report, {{carried out by the}} Accountant-general on February 3, proposed a strict implementation of Eurocypria’s business plan to reinforce its profit-making abilities. Meanwhile, it was proposed that a strategic investor be found. Failure to do so by mid-2010, it added, would lead to Eurocypria going bankrupt, in combination with some of its human and material resources being absorbed by national carrier Cyprus Airways. According to the Accountant-general, this would reduce the cost of bankruptcy from €84 million to €55 million. The second report - carried out by technocrats at the Finance Ministry and Planning Office - contradicted Finance Minister Charilaos Stavrakis’ claims that the reports {{had nothing to do with}} the €35 million injection, as its conclusions were centred on the <b>specific</b> <b>fund.</b>|$|E

From the Eurekahedge database, a sample consisting of 95 AHFs was selected for this study, covering the period of 1 st January 2000 - 31 st May 2009. Results confirmed that (1) diversification benefits exist in AHFs, (2) optimal number of funds exist for a portfolio of AHFs, (3) many portfolios of AHFs with <b>specific</b> <b>fund</b> characteristics achieved high probabilities of being either the first or the second best-performing portfolios at various levels of standard deviations, and (4) the PGP method was shown to be more effective than the MV method as it enables different efficient frontiers to be constructed according to individual investors&# 039; risk preferences...|$|E
