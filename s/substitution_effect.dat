25|$|In {{economics}} and consumer theory, a Giffen good {{is a product}} that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versa—violating the basic law of demand in microeconomics. For any other sort of good, {{as the price of}} the good rises, the <b>substitution</b> <b>effect</b> makes consumers purchase less of it, and more of substitute goods; for most goods, the income effect (due to the effective decline in available income due to more being spent on existing units of this good) reinforces this decline in demand for the good. But a Giffen good is so strongly an inferior good in the minds of consumers (being more in demand at lower incomes) that this contrary income effect more than offsets the <b>substitution</b> <b>effect,</b> and the net effect of the good's price rise is to increase demand for it.|$|E
25|$|Higher pay for {{overtime}} hours {{can reduce}} or negate {{the effect of}} a backward bending labour supply curve, by increasing wages only for hours worked beyond a certain amount. Overtime maintains the <b>substitution</b> <b>effect</b> at a high labour supply. However, the income effect from the wages increasing on all the previous hours worked is eliminated. Thus, higher hourly overtime pay can cause workers to work more hours than if the higher rate is paid on all hours.|$|E

25|$|This income {{change can}} come from one of two sources: from {{external}} sources, or from income being freed up (or soaked up) by a decrease (or increase) {{in the price of}} a good that money is being spent on. The effect of the former type of change in available income is depicted by the income-consumption curve discussed in the remainder of this article, while the effect of the freeing-up of existing income by a price drop is discussed along with its companion effect, the <b>substitution</b> <b>effect,</b> in the article on the latter.|$|E
25|$|Social Security {{affects the}} saving {{behavior}} {{of the people in}} three different ways. The wealth <b>substitution</b> <b>effect</b> occurs when a person saving for retirement recognizes that the Social Security system will take care of him and decreases his expectations about how much he needs to personally save. The retirement effect occurs when a taxpayer saves more each year in an effort to reduce the total number of years he must work to accumulate enough savings before retirement. The bequest effect occurs when a taxpayer recognizes a decrease in resources stemming from the Social Security tax and compensates by increasing personal savings to cover future expected costs of having children.|$|E
25|$|The law {{of demand}} states that, in general, price and {{quantity}} demanded {{in a given}} market are inversely related. That is, the higher {{the price of a}} product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy (other things unchanged). As the price of a commodity falls, consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods (the <b>substitution</b> <b>effect).</b> In addition, purchasing power from the price decline increases ability to buy (the income effect). Other factors can change demand; for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a normal good outward relative to the origin, as in the figure. All determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{quality of}} life research, social aspects have become {{recognized}} as important, next to physical aspects such as living conditions and health. However, objective indicators of physical and social aspects often correlate poorly with indicators of subjective well being. We argue {{that this may be}} due to buffer and <b>substitution</b> <b>effects.</b> People produce their own well-being and there are multiple means for realizing the same ultimate goals. Multiple means allow the formation of buffers which cushion the negative effect of loss and they allow substitution when some means become costlier or inaccessible. In order to trace buffer and <b>substitution</b> <b>effects,</b> one needs a theory that specifies these multiple means and the goals they serve (goal hierarchy). One such theory is Social Production Function theory which we use to trace buffer and <b>substitution</b> <b>effects.</b> We test the hypotheses on these effects with data on 1094 Dutch respondents. Even though the data are cross-sectional and thus do not allow us to demonstrate buffer and <b>substitution</b> <b>effects</b> on the individual level, there are good indications in the data that such effects exist...|$|R
40|$|Asymmetries in cross-price elasticities {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} by several empirical studies. In this paper we study from a theoretical stance how introducing asymmetry in the <b>substitution</b> <b>effects</b> influences the sustainability of collusion. We characterize the equilibrium of a linear Cournot duopoly with substitute goods, and consider <b>substitution</b> <b>effects</b> which are asymmetric in magnitude. Within this framework, we study partial collusion using Friedman (1971) solution concept. Our main result shows that the interval of quantities supporting collusion in the asymmetric setting is always smaller than the interval in the symmetric benchmark. Thus, the asymmetry in the <b>substitution</b> <b>effects</b> makes collusion more difficult to sustain. This implies that previous Antitrust decisions could be reversed by considering the role {{of this kind of}} asymmetry. ...|$|R

2500|$|A price drop for {{commodity}} X causes two effects. The {{reduced price}} alters relative prices {{in favour of}} commodity X, known as the <b>substitution</b> <b>effect.</b> This is illustrated by a movement down the indifference curve from point A to point B (a pivot of the budget constraint about the original indifference curve). At the same time, the price reduction increases consumer purchasing power, known as the income effect (an outward shift of the budget constraint). This {{is illustrated by the}} shifting out of the dotted line to MP (where P = income divided by the new price of commodity X). The <b>substitution</b> <b>effect</b> (point A to point B) raises the quantity demanded of commodity X from Xa to Xb while the income effect lowers the quantity demanded from Xb to Xc. The net effect is a reduction in quantity demanded from Xa to Xc making commodity X a Giffen good by definition. Any good where the income effect more than compensates for the <b>substitution</b> <b>effect</b> is a [...] Giffen good.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>substitution</b> <b>effect</b> is {{the change}} in demands {{resulting}} from a price change that alters {{the slope of the}} budget constraint but leaves the consumer on the same indifference curve. In other words, it illustrates the consumer's new consumption basket after the price change while being compensated as to allow the consumer to be as happy as he or she was previously. By this effect, the consumer is posited to substitute toward the good that becomes comparatively less expensive. In the illustration below this corresponds to an imaginary budget constraint denoted SC being tangent to the indifference curve I1. Then the income effect from the rise in purchasing power from a price fall reinforces the <b>substitution</b> <b>effect.</b> [...] If the good is an inferior good, then the income effect will offset in some degree the <b>substitution</b> <b>effect.</b> [...] If the income effect for an inferior good is sufficiently strong, the consumer will buy less of the good when it becomes less expensive, a Giffen good (commonly believed to be a rarity).|$|E
40|$|Terence Hutchison (1953) {{has argued}} that in his Manual of Political Economy Vilfredo Pareto {{provided}} a verbal, non-mathematical description of income and <b>substitution</b> <b>effects.</b> Hutchison's claim on Pareto''s behalf is important since it would move {{the date of the}} discovery of the concept (if not the mathematical proof) of separate income and <b>substitution</b> <b>effects</b> back from 1915 to the 1906 publication of the original Italian language version of the Manual, and would reassign priority for the discovery from Slutsky to Pareto. This note reexamines this claim of Hutchison''s, and shows that in fact it is mistaken. Pareto did not actually discuss income and <b>substitution</b> <b>effects</b> as they are now understood. Rather, in the passage which Hutchison cites, Pareto was discussing the impact of a change in income, not prices, on quantities demand. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores on-the-job leisure {{choice in}} individual labor supply environments and in work teams. The individual static labor supply theory implies that income-compensated wage increases will increase {{hours of work}} [...] positive <b>substitution</b> <b>effects</b> on work hours. While positive <b>substitution</b> <b>effects</b> are the testable implication of the theory, numerous empirical studies estimate negative <b>substitution</b> <b>effects</b> and therefore question the empirically validity of that model. I present a framework for the individual labor supply decision that theoretically explains negative <b>substitution</b> <b>effects</b> {{as the result of}} substituting on- and off-the-job leisure. An experimental environment in which subjects perform a task for piece-rate wages provides the data to test this theory. When on- and off-the-job leisure are choice variables, the results show that average <b>substitution</b> <b>effects</b> on hours worked are positive (implying that the classical theory is robust with respect to the assumption of no on-the-job leisure) but that some individuals display negative <b>substitution</b> <b>effects.</b> This provides evidence consistent with the substitution of on- and off-the-job leisure. When only on-the-job leisure is a choice variable, the data support another theoretical extension which predicts positive <b>substitution</b> <b>effects</b> on work effort. The results have implications for employers who might try to induce more work effort (less on-the-job leisure) through income-compensated wage increases. Work team decisions are also examined {{in the context of the}} voluntary contributions mechanism for public goods provision. Expected utility theory predicts that free-riding will dominate more efficient social incentives, and that uncertainty with respect to the provision of the public good will cause even more free-riding. An experimental environment confirms the existence of free-riding in this "uncertainty" environment, but results are mixed as to whether the free-riding is worse than in situations without the uncertainty. When the probability of public goods provision increases in group contributions, higher marginal incentives promote higher contributions. These results have implications for work team managers. If uncertainty lowers contributions, compensation based on effort instead of outcomes may raise effort. However, since higher contribution levels raise marginal incentives, any way in which a team manager could raise effort would be beneficial since it would promote high future effort...|$|R

Using the full sample, we document a negative relationship between audit quality and the use of collateral that is consistent with lenders’ interests. We also show that audit quality and collateral are regarded as alternative means of reducing debt credit risk. Our conclusions are robust after using an auditor-switching test, the Heckman two-stage model and a propensity-score matching model to address endogeneity issues. China’s institutional background is also considered. First, we find that in the group of firms in which large shareholders are able to control borrowers’ activities, the <b>substitution</b> <b>effects</b> between collateral and audit quality are reduced when the degree of separation between large shareholders’ control and ownership is high. Second, these <b>substitution</b> <b>effects</b> are greater when the borrowers’ ultimate controller is a state-owned enterprise (SOE) rather than a non-state-owned enterprise (NSOE). Third, the differences in <b>substitution</b> <b>effects</b> between NSOEs and SOEs are smaller in areas with a high market-development index. We conclude that the <b>substitution</b> <b>effects</b> are smaller in high credit risk firms than in low credit risk firms...|$|R

2500|$|The law {{of demand}} {{states that the}} rate of {{consumption}} falls as the price of the good rises, even when the consumer is monetarily compensated for the effect of the higher price; this is called the <b>substitution</b> <b>effect.</b> As the price of a good rises, consumers will substitute away from that good, choosing [...] more of other alternatives.

2500|$|For cost {{reducing}} resource efficiency, {{distinguishing between}} {{direct and indirect}} effects is shown in Figure 1 below. [...] The horizontal axis shows units of consumption of the targets good (which could be for example clothes washing, and {{measured in terms of}} kilograms of clean clothes) with consumption of all other goods and services on the vertical axis. [...] An economical technology change that enables each unit of washing to be produced with less electricity results in a reduction of the price per unit of washing. [...] This shifts the household budget line rightwards. [...] The result is a <b>substitution</b> <b>effect</b> because of the decreased relative price, but also an income effect due to the increased real income. [...] The <b>substitution</b> <b>effect</b> increases consumption of washing from Q1 to QS, and the income effect from QS to Q2. [...] The total increase in consumption of washing from Q1 to Q2 and the resulting increase in electricity consumption is the direct effect. [...] The indirect effect comprises the increase in other consumption, from O1 to O2. [...] The scale of each of these effects depends on the elasticity of demand for each of the goods, and the embodied resource or externality associated with each good. Indirect effects are difficult to measure empirically. In the manufacturing sector, {{it has been estimated that}} there is about a 24% rebound effect due to increases in fuel efficiency. A parallel effect will happen for cost saving efficient technologies for producers, where output and substitution effects will occur.|$|E

However, if the real wage increased from W2 to W3, the number of hours offered to work for pay would fall from L2 to L3 since the strength of the income effect now exceeds that of the substitution effect; the utility to be gained from an extra hour of unpaid time is now greater than the utility to be gained from extra income that could be earned by working the extra hour.|$|E
