In the animal tests on the effectiveness of SH medical compounds, BAL was the most effective and then sodium thiosulfate was next, while scarecely effect was observed in the experiments of cystine, methionine and <b>sodium</b> <b>mercaptoacetate.</b> 2. By the administration of PAM, SH enzyme such as mucoprotein was promptly and certainly reactivated as well as cholinesterase...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of the}} {{aluminium}} alloy AA 2024 -T 3 has long been associated with a strong vulnerability to localised corrosion. Dealloying and pitting corrosion can occur on and around intermetallic particles when exposed to aggressive environments such as sodium chloride electrolytes. Specific combinations of rare earths and organic compounds have demonstrated strong synergistic inhibition on the AA 2024 -T 3 alloy. This work has focused on rare earths and organic compounds containing thiol functional groups. It is believed that the sulphur in the thiol group can form protective films {{over the surface of}} copper-rich intermetallic particles due to the affinity between copper and sulphur. Previous studies with the multiwell tests have identified that solutions containing <b>sodium</b> <b>mercaptoacetate</b> provided strong inhibition at pH 3 and 6. This work presents the initial findings from the polarisation tests and constant immersion corrosion experiments in the presence of <b>sodium</b> <b>mercaptoacetate.</b> <br /...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Hydrogen {{sulphide}} {{production by}} washed bacterial suspensions in buffered substrate solutions was examined. The suspensions were tested for H,S production from cysteine, cystine, homocystine, methionine, mercaptoacetate, sulphite, sulphate or thiosulphate. Some {{strains of the}} Proteus, Klebsiella, Salmo-nella, Arizona and Bethesda groups produced hydrogen sulphide when loll or more washed organisms/ml. were incubated at 37 " without an added source of sulphur. Generally tenfold greater quantities of bacteria were required to produce hydrogen sulphide within 24 hr. from homocystine, sulphite or thiosulphite as com-pared with cystine or cysteine. For the production of hydrogen sulphide from <b>sodium</b> <b>mercaptoacetate,</b> 10 - and 100 -fold larger quantities of bacteria were required. In the Brucella group all strains behaved alike, except two non-smooth strains which were spontaneously agglutinated in the buffer + substrate solutions and did not produce hydrogen sulphide. Among the Enterobacteriaceae the most active strains belonged to the Proteus group, the most inactive strains to the Large-Sachs group. All strains of the Arizona and Bethesda groups, and some Klebsiella...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the fatty acid {{oxidation}} inhibitor, <b>sodium</b> <b>mercaptoacetate</b> (MA, 600 µmol/kg) on peripheral energy substrate metabolism was investigated in rats with permanent heart catheters. Rats were either fed, 48 -h food deprived, or exercising for 30 min. Before and after intravenous MA injection, stress-free blood samples were taken for measurement of blood glucose, plasma free fatty acids (FFA), insulin, epinephrine (E), and norepinephrine (NE) concentrations. In fed animals, MA increased blood glucose, plasma FFA, and NE and decreased insulin concentrations. Plasma E levels did not change. In 48 -h-deprived animals, MA elevated low baseline glucose concentrations to levels observed in MA-treated fed animals. Plasma insulin concentrations decreased to almost undetectable levels. Plasma catecholamines and FFA were increased compared to fed rats. In exercising rats, MA caused an exaggerated increase of blood glucose and a pronounced reduction of plasma insulin without affecting exercise-induced FFA and catecholamine responses. The data revealed that the mechanisms that regulate blood glucose concentrations during MA treatment are dependent on the nutritional state and ambient energy expenditure. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} glucoprivation and lipoprivation on sympathoadrenal outflow were {{investigated}} in rats with permanent intra-atrial catheters. Glucoprivation was induced by infusion of a hypoglycemic dose of insulin (3 U/kg) or by infusion of the glucose antimetabolite, 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (2 -DG, 200 mg/kg). Lipoprivation was induced by infusion of <b>sodium</b> <b>mercaptoacetate</b> (MA, 600 /µmol/kg), which blocks beta oxidation of fatty acids. Stress-free blood samples for measurement of blood glucose, plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), and epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were collected remotely {{before and after}} drug injection. Glucoprivation and lipoprivation differed significantly in their effects on the sympathoadrenal system. Both 2 -DG- and insulin-induced glucoprivation appeared to increase adrenomedullary secretion selectively, leading to dramatically increased plasma E levels. Although plasma NE levels also rose during glucoprivation, other evidence suggests that this effect may be secondary to the rise in E. In contrast, MA-induced lipoprivation increased the outflow of NE from the sympathetic nerve endings without {{a significant effect on}} plasma E concentrations. Plasma E levels rose only late in the test, as blood glucose levels began to fall. Results indicate that glucoprivation and lipoprivation are distinct metabolic signals, each capable of seleetively activating one branch of the sympathoadrenomedullary system and thereby facilitating the mobilization of metabolic fuels appropriate for the specific metabolic challenge. ...|$|E
