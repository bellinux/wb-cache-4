To better understand {{the mechanics of the}} normal and fibrotic rat liver, we carried out a series of studies using parallel plate rheometry, measuring the response to compressive, extensional, and shear strains. We found that the shear storage and loss moduli G' and G" and the apparent Young's moduli measured by uniaxial strain orthogonal to the shear direction increased markedly with both progressive fibrosis and increasing compression, that livers shear <b>strain</b> <b>softened,</b> and that significant increases in shear modulus with compressional stress occurred within a range consistent with increased sinusoidal pressures in liver disease.

A key feature of this model is that, while it assumes overall liver incompressibility, it takes into account water flow and solid phase compressibility. In sum, we report a detailed study of non-linear liver mechanics under physiological strains in the normal state, early fibrosis, and late fibrosis.

Prucalopride is a novel, selective serotonin(4) receptor agonist with enterokinetic properties. AIMS: Pilot study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of prucalopride and placebo in patients with severe CC referred to a tertiary centre. METHODS: After 4 -weeks' run in, patients were randomized to 4 weeks' once daily, double-blind treatment with either prucalopride 4 mg (n = 27) or placebo (n = 26). A 50 % dose reduction after 2 weeks' treatment was possible for patients with an excessive gastrointestinal response to the study medication (severe cramps, abdominal pain, and diarrhea). Patients assessed efficacy using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and recorded bowel function in daily diaries. The investigator assessed efficacy and total gut transit time (marker study). RESULTS: Patient VAS assessment demonstrated that prucalopride was significantly more effective than placebo in softening stools, and decreasing straining and time to first stool. Prucalopride also had a positive effect on stool frequency, feeling of complete evacuation and total gut transit time, although these differences were not statistically significant compared with placebo. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal symptoms and headache; most were mild to moderate. There were no clinically relevant effects on cardiovascular or laboratory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily prucalopride 4 mg for 4 weeks is effective and well tolerated in patients with severe CC. It improves whole gut transit, reducing <b>straining,</b> <b>softening</b> stools and reducing time to first bowel movement. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Contraction of {{detrusor}} {{smooth muscle}} (DSM) at short muscle lengths generates a stiffness component we termed adjustable passive stiffness (APS) that is retained in tissues incubated in a Ca 2 +-free solution, shifts the DSM length-passive tension curve {{up and to}} the left, and is <b>softened</b> by muscle <b>strain</b> and release (<b>strain</b> <b>softened).</b> In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that APS is due to slowly cycling actomyosin cross bridges. APS and active tension produced by the stimulus, KCl, displayed similar length dependencies with identical optimum length values. The myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin relaxed active tension maintained during a KCl-induced contraction and the passive tension maintained during stress-relaxation induced by muscle stretch in a Ca 2 +-free solution. Passive tension was attributed to tension maintaining rather than tension developing cross bridges because tension did not recover after a rapid 10 % stretch and release as it did during a KCl-induced contraction. APS generated by a KCl-induced contraction in intact tissues was preserved in tissues permeabilized with Triton X- 100. Blebbistatin and the actin polymerization inhibitor latrunculin-B reduced the degree of APS generated by a KCl-induced contraction. The degree of APS generated by KCl was inhibited {{to a greater degree}} than was the peak KCl-induced tension by rhoA kinase and cyclooxygenase inhibitors. These data support the hypothesis that APS is due to slowly cycling actomyosin cross bridges and suggest that cross bridges may play a novel role in DSM that uniquely serves to ensure proper contractile function over an extreme working length range...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Experiments {{were carried}} out in which the {{dependence}} of the fractional softening on temperature, time and strain rate was determined in a 304 H stainless steel. Three prestrain ranges were identified pertaining to three different post-deformation softening behaviors: 1) prestraining to below the DRX critical strain: strongly <b>strain</b> dependent <b>softening</b> by SRX alone with softening kinetics controlled by growth rate of the nuclei; 2) prestraining to above the DRX critical strain: SRX + MDRX <b>softening</b> with weaker <b>strain</b> dependence of the kinetics but still controlled by grain growth; 3) at a prestrain of ε* and beyond: nucleation-controlled MDRX softening with the full inhibition of SRX. The transition prestrain ε * can exceed the peak strain if the DRX grain refinement ratio g = D 0 /DDRX> 4. The transition to MDRX-dominated softening {{can be attributed to}} a constant value of the normalized strain hardening rate independent of the preloading temperature and <b>strain</b> rate. The <b>softening</b> data from the compression tests show that at ε*, the time for half softening t 50 exhibits a minimum. These data differ somewhat from observations obtained in the torsion testing of solid bars, in which no strain dependence of t 50 was detected at ε * and beyond. Whether or not the strain dependence of t 50 vanishes in the MDRX range is sensitive to the test method employed to study the post-deformation softening...|$|R

5000|$|The {{formation}} of a Lüders band is preceded by a yield point and {{a drop in the}} flow stress. Then the band appears as a localized event of a single band between plastically deformed and undeformed material that moves with the constant cross head velocity. The Lüders Band usually starts {{at one end of the}} specimen and propagates toward the other end. The visible front on the material usually makes a well-defined angle typically 50-55° from the specimen axis as it moves down the sample. During the propagation of the band the nominal stress-strain curve is flat.

50|$|In LEFMPA, during cracking, no {{specific}} region is mentioned {{in between the}} area which is cracked and that which is not. But {{it is evident that}} in concrete, there is some intermediate space between cracked and uncracked portion. This region is defined as the Fracture Process Zone (FPZ). FPZ consists of micro cracks which are minute individual cracks situated nearer to crack tip. As the crack propagates these micro cracks merge and becomes a single structure to give continuity to the already existing crack. So indeed, FPZ acts as a bridging zone between cracked region and uncracked region.

50|$|With {{increasing}} turbine entry temperature, it {{is important}} to gain a fundamental understanding of the physical phenomena occurring during creep deformation of single crystal superalloys under such extreme condition (i.e. high temperature and high stress). The creep deformation behavior of superalloy single crystal is strongly temperature, stress, orientation and alloy dependent. For a single-crystal superalloy, there are 3 different mode of creep deformation under regimes of different temperature and stress: Rafting, Tertiary and Primary. At low temperature (~750 °C), SX alloys exhibits mostly primary creep behavior. Matan et al. concluded that the extent of primary creep deformation depends strongly on the angle between the tensile axis and the <001>/<011> symmetry boundary. At temperature above 850 °C, tertiary creep dominates and promotes <b>strain</b> <b>softening</b> behavior. When temperature exceeds 1000 °C, the rafting effect is prevalent where cubic particles transform into flat shapes under tensile stress The rafts would also form perpendicular to the tensile axis, since γ phase was transported out of the vertical channels and into the horizontal ones. After conducting unaxial creep deformation of <001> orientated CMSX-4 single crystal superalloy at 1105 °C and 100 MPa, Reed et al. has established that rafting is beneficial to creep life since it delays evolution of creep strain. In addition, rafting would occur quickly and suppress the accumulation of creep strain until a critical strain is reached.|$|E

The complexity of rock behaviour, especially of the sedimentary soft rock type has made exact mathematical predictions very difficult. The need for alternative methods was clearly defined. In the past various methods to measure in situ stresses were developed. Early measurements were in most cases limited to one dimension and were often {{used to measure the}} magnitude of vertical stress concentrations around the mine openings. No detailed discussions on the historical stress measurement development is attempted here since many publications dealing with the topic are readily available. To understand the behaviour of strata around the mine openings located within laminated and often <b>strain</b> <b>softened</b> rock, it is necessary to conduct a detailed underground geotechnical investigation. In general, the geological complexity and rock behaviour in most underground coal mines requires in situ investigation of: a) geological structure of roof rock, coal and the floor rock, b) geological disturbances such as faults, fractures and other discontinuities associated with displacement c) detailed stress/displacement measurements as mining takes place. Results are then used for mine planning purposes, mine sequencing, pillar design and design of efficient roof reinforcement. No detailed 3 -dimensional stress measurements in coal mines were conducted till recent {{advances in}} usage of CSIRO 3 -dimensional soft inclusion stress cells developed by ACIRL. The stress cells were originally designed for overcoring stress measurements. 3 -dimensional stress measurements were often used in metalliferous mines for some time to measure long term stress changes in stopes.
