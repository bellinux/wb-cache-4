50|$|Similar to a <b>split-plot</b> <b>design,</b> a strip-plot design {{can result}} when {{some type of}} {{restricted}} randomization has occurred during the experiment. A simple factorial design {{can result in a}} strip-plot design depending on how the experiment was conducted. Strip-plot designs often result from experiments that are conducted over two or more process steps in which each process step is a batch process, i.e., completing each treatment combination of the experiment requires more than one processing step with experimental units processed together at each process step. As in the <b>split-plot</b> <b>design,</b> strip-plot designs result when the randomization in the experiment has been restricted in some way. As a result of the restricted randomization that occurs in strip-plot designs, there are multiple sizes of experimental units. Therefore, there are different error terms or different error variances that are used to test the factors of interest in the design. A traditional strip-plot design has three sizes of experimental units.|$|E

50|$|A <b>split-plot</b> <b>design</b> {{has more}} than one size {{experimental}} unit. In this experiment, one size experimental unit is an individual copper strip. The treatments or factors that were applied to the individual strips are solution temperature and current (these factors were changed each time a new strip was placed in the solution). The other or larger size experimental unit is a set of four copper strips. The treatment or factor that was applied to a set of four strips is solution concentration (this factor was changed after four strips were processed).

50|$|Running the {{experiment}} {{in this way}} also results in a <b>split-plot</b> <b>design</b> in which the whole-plot factors are again solution concentration and solution temperature and the subplot factor is current. In this experiment, one size experimental unit is an individual copper strip.

50|$|As can be {{seen from}} these three scenarios, one of the major {{differences}} in split-plot designs versus simple factorial designs is the number of different sizes of experimental units in the experiment. Split-plot designs have more than one size experimental unit, i.e., more than one error term. Since these designs involve different sizes of experimental units and different variances, the standard errors of the various mean comparisons involve {{one or more of the}} variances. Specifying the appropriate model for a <b>split-plot</b> <b>design</b> involves being able to identify each size of experimental unit. The way an experimental unit is defined relative to the design structure (for example, a completely randomized design versus a randomized complete block design) and the treatment structure (for example, a full 23 factorial, a resolution V half fraction, a two-way treatment structure with a control group, etc.). As a result of having greater than one size experimental unit, the appropriate model used to analyze split-plot designs is a mixed model.|$|E

Industrial experimentation involving optimality criteria has not been fully exhausted. In this study, we present a literature review on the development of optimal <b>design</b> of <b>split-plot</b> experiments. <b>Split-plot</b> <b>designs,</b> optimality criteria are discussed.

40|$|Many {{existing}} {{methods for}} constructing optimal <b>split-plot</b> <b>designs,</b> such as D-optimal designs, only focus on minimizing the variances and covariances of the estimation for the fitted model. However, the underlying true model is usually complicated and unknown and the fitted model is often misspecified. If there exist significant effects {{that are not}} included in the model, then the estimation could be highly biased. Therefore, a good <b>split-plot</b> <b>designs</b> should be able to simultaneously control the variances/covariances and the bias of the estimation. In this paper, we propose a new method for constructing optimal <b>split-plot</b> <b>designs</b> that are robust for model misspecification. We provide a general form of the loss function used for the D-optimal minimax criterion and apply it to searching for robust <b>split-plot</b> <b>designs.</b> To more efficiently construct designs, we develop an algorithm which combines the anneal algorithm and point-exchange algorithm.

In order to identify optimal fractional factorial <b>split-plot</b> <b>designs</b> in this setting, the Hellinger distance criterion (Bingham and Chipman (2007)) is proposed. The approach is Bayesian and directly incorporates common experimenter assumptions. By specifying prior distributions for the model space, the criterion for fractional factorial <b>split-plot</b> <b>designs</b> aims to discriminate between the most probable competing models.

40|$|Common {{experimental}} practices suggest randomizing {{the order}} in which runs are performed. However, there may be situations in which randomization might not produce the most desirable order, especially in the presence of known trends. There has been research done on systematically designing experiments to be robust against trends. However, few studies address the additional dimensions that arise in nested <b>designs</b> such as <b>split-plot</b> <b>designs.</b> <b>Split-plot</b> <b>designs</b> have been used for many years in agricultural applications and are sometimes preferred where there are hard-to-change factors in industrial settings. There currently is no established methodology to produce <b>split-plot</b> <b>designs</b> that are robust to potential two-dimensional trends. The objective of this work is to develop a methodology to design run orders for two-level, split-plot (2 w × 2 s) designs that are robust or nearly robust against a set of trends. Two methods are developed in this work. A fold-over method that uses already established principles is extended for use in <b>split-plot</b> <b>designs.</b> The second method uses an integer linear programming approach to search for an optimal design that is resistant to specific trends.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new method for generating optimal split-plot designs. These designs are optimal {{in the sense that}} they are efficient for estimating the fixed effects of the statistical model that is appropriate given the <b>split-plot</b> <b>design</b> structure. One advantage of the method is that it does not require the prior specification of a candidate set. This makes the production of split-plot designs computationally feasible in situations where the candidate set is too large to be tractable. The method allows for flexible choice of the sample size and supports inclusion of both continuous and categorical factors. The model can be any linear regression model and may include arbitrary polynomial terms in the continuous factors and interaction terms of any order. We demonstrate the usefulness of this flexibility with a 100 -run polypropylene experiment involving 11 factors where we found a design that is substantially more efficient than designs produced using other approaches.

40|$|Many {{industrial}} experiments involve restricted {{rather than}} complete randomization. This {{often leads to}} the use of <b>split-plot</b> <b>designs,</b> which limit the number of independent settings of some of the experimental factors. These factors, named whole-plot factors, are often, in some way, hard to change. The remaining factors, called sub-plot factors, are easier to change. Their levels are therefore independently reset for every run of the experiment. In general, model estimation from data from split-plot experiments requires the use of generalized least squares (GLS). However, for some <b>split-plot</b> <b>designs,</b> the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator will produce the same factor-effect estimates as the GLS estimator. These designs are called equivalent-estimation <b>split-plot</b> <b>designs</b> and offer the advantage that estimation of the factor effects does not require estimation of the variance components in the split-plot model. While many of the equivalent-estimation second-order response surface designs presented in the literature do not perform well in terms of estimation efficiency (as measured by the D-optimality criterion), Macharia and Goos (2010) showed that, in many instances, it is possible to generate second-order equivalent-estimation <b>split-plot</b> <b>designs</b> that are highly efficient and, hence, provide precise factor-effect estimates. In the present paper, we present an algorithm that allow us to (i) identify equivalent-estimation designs for scenarios where Macharia and Goos (2010) did not find equivalent-estimation designs, and (ii) find equivalent-estimation designs that outperform those of Macharia and Goos (2010) in terms of the D-optimality criterion...|$|R
