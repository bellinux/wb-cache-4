25|$|Starting in December 1959, {{the fully}} {{automatic}} train was tested on the BMT Sea Beach Line express tracks between the 18th Avenue and New Utrecht Avenue stations. The train {{was equipped with}} a telephone system to keep voice communication with human dispatchers at the two shuttle terminals. At each station there was a cabinet that housed 24 relay systems that made up electronic dispatchers. The relays controlled the starting of the train, the acceleration, braking, and <b>stopping</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train,</b> {{as well as the}} opening and closing of the car doors. The relays were operated by electrical impulses initiated by a punched tape. When operating at full speed, the train operated at 30 miles per hour, and the train slowed to 5.5 miles per hour when coming into the two stations. When entering stations, the train passed through a series of detectors, which caused a series of tripper arms at trackside to go into the open position if the train was going at the speed. If the train was going too quickly, the tripper arms would stay upright and the train's brakes would automatically be set.|$|E

[...] The monotony of the {{narrative}} in the seat behind, fatally combining with {{the heat of the}} day, had lulled her into slumbers from which she awoke at the <b>stopping</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train,</b> to find her head resting tenderly upon her husband's shoulder.|$|E
5000|$|A {{water stop}} or water station on a {{railroad}} {{is a place}} where steam trains stop to replenish water. The <b>stopping</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> itself is also referred to as a [...] "water stop". The term originates from the times of steam engines when large amounts of water were essential. Also known as wood and water stops or coal and water stops, since it was reasonable to replenish engines with fuel as well when adding water to the boiler.|$|E

5000|$|Following initial {{trials of}} {{automatic}} train control on the District Line in 1963, {{five of the six}} 4-car units of 1960 stock were altered for a full-scale trial on the Woodford to Hainault branch. The intention was to ensure that such control was reliable {{by the time it was}} introduced on the Victoria Line, then under construction. Part of the conversion process involved the provision of a trip valve instead of a trip cock for emergency <b>stopping</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train,</b> but the trip cocks were retained, so that the trains could operate on tracks which were not equipped for automatic train operation, and the train stops on the Woodford to Hainault branch were retained, as conventional trains still had to use the branch to reach Hainault depot. The five units were stabled in the depot, and a maximum of four were used on the Woodford to Hainualt experiments at any one time, with the first train running on 5 April 1964. By 1974, the standard stock trailers were becoming a maintenance liability, and three of the units had their two trailers replaced by a single modified 1938 stock trailer. Because of the cost of the conversion, the trailers of the remaining two units were refurbished, which included repainting in white, rather than aluminium, at the depot.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors {{describe}} a possibility to use adaptive control algorithms for a train braking system. The following assumptions were put forward: a {{programmable logic controller}} (PLC) or microcontroller with a control program based on an adaptive control algorithm and a current train braking control system ensures an automatic smooth and precise braking of a train; and another controller with a smaller footprint connected to the same train braking system ensures an automatic <b>stopping</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> before the red light. Some of the available adaptive search algorithms are discussed and the one {{which is the most}} suitable and the most effective of them for this task is selected. The authors designed the control program for a PLC and other controller and carried out the first testing of the developed system. In the conclusion of the article there is an analysis of the results and an evaluation of the selected control algorithms effectiveness...|$|E

50|$|Rio Piedras {{is served}} by the Tren Urbano Metro system with {{stations}} at <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras and in downtown Río Piedras. Even though these two stations are considered the current stations at Río Piedras, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> in <b>the</b> municipality <b>of</b> San Juan are located in areas that were part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> municipality <b>of</b> Río Piedras prior to 1951.|$|R
50|$|The Ruskin railway station, {{built in}} 1910, stood here until {{there were no}} longer enough {{passengers}} to warrant a <b>stop</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scheduled <b>trains.</b> <b>The</b> building was dismantled in 1961.|$|R

50|$|Distant {{aspects that}} {{announce}} 'halt' or 'proceed with low speed', like Vr 0, Vr 2, Ks 2, Hl 10 etc., are normally (except for repeaters) {{accompanied by an}} activated 1000 Hz magnet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PZB <b>train</b> safety system. Passing it triggers hidden timers in <b>the</b> vehicle's part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PZB system, which first checks that the driver acknowledges the distant signal, then it supervises the braking. If the acknowledgement does not occur in time or if, at any point, the system detects that the train´s speed exceeds <b>the</b> limits <b>of</b> a certain braking profile, it engages full brakes and enforces a <b>stop</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 500 Hz {{inductor}} can {{be found}} shortly before a main signal which actives a speed control for next 250 m. This will extend the braking curve Vü1 from the 1000 Hz up to the main signal. The restricted mode after a 1000 Hz {{is followed by a}} braking curve Vü2 to reduce the speed up to the main signal. While the switch speed was at 10 km/h after the 1000 Hz speed limiter (reflecting a full <b>stop</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train)</b> it does now follow braking curve being again no more than 10 km/h at <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main signal. The actual braking curves depend again on <b>the</b> <b>train</b> type (which is based on the braking percent <b>the</b> <b>train</b> driver has calculated).|$|R

At this station, after <b>the</b> detachment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coaches to Astana {{and a long}} <b>stop</b> <b>of</b> 7 hours, <b>the</b> <b>train</b> continued to Samara, Buguruslan and ended at Ufa station.|$|R
50|$|Likewise, <b>the</b> Hillerød <b>trains</b> kept <b>the</b> <b>stopping</b> pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steam <b>trains</b> and ran {{non-stop}} all the {{way from}} Østerport to Holte. Only from 1989 did this tradition break down, and the Hillerød services gradually gained intermediate stops at Hellerup (1989) and Lyngby (1991), and finally (1995) at all stations between Østerport and Hellerup.|$|R
50|$|This is <b>the</b> last <b>stop</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gornergrat <b>train,</b> {{opened in}} 1898, which climbs almost 1500 m through Riffelalp and Riffelberg.
