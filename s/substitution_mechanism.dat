(2005). Therefore, {{the observation that}} [Ti] is the dominant mechanism for water incorporation in olivine from San Carlos xenoliths (Berry et al. 2005) may reflect internal re-equilibration during cooling to some extent as yet unknown. Loss of water from olivine, which has often been inferred from both phenocryst olivines in magmas during eruption, or from olivines in xenoliths during their exhumation (e.g. Tollan et al. 2015 and references therein), may also affect speciation. Water loss changes a_SiO_ 2 (inter alia), hence the point-defect structure of the olivine, in different ways according to the different <b>substitution</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (Eqs.  1, 2, 3 and 4). The effects of this are further complicated by the different rates of diffusion of H associated with the different <b>substitution</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (Padrón-Navarta et al. 2014).|$|R

From the composition of the unit cell of these apatites, the contributions of the <b>substitution</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for the incorporation of CO 32 - and M(+) could be calculated.

3000|$|This study {{presents}} the results of G-type experiments at one condition of temperature and pressure, namely 1050  °C and 3  GPa, which confirm the identities of the four main <b>substitution</b> <b>mechanisms</b> by which water is likely to be incorporated into mainstream mantle olivines. The results demonstrate the role that a_H_ 2 O plays in determining which mechanisms are significant at the experimental condition, but from the stoichiometries of the <b>substitution</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> the same principle should apply at other pressures and temperatures. Evaluating water solubilities is not straightforward because it depends on the mechanisms by which water is incorporated (the type of hydrous defect), which in turn is dictated by other factors, most notably composition and silica activity. The consequence of this is that under otherwise identical conditions, higher water activities will favour hydrated silicon vacancies ([Si]) over other defects. Conversely, at low water activities, the ratio of hydrated silicon vacancies to other hydrous defects will be much lower. This has profound impacts for our understanding of water storage in the mantle and interpretation of measurements of natural olivine from different mantle domains. For example, the absence of the infrared absorption bands associated with the [Si] mechanism does not necessarily indicate high silica activity but could be due to low water activities, as expected in most mantle environments (Bali et al. 2008; Lamb and Popp 2009). This is highlighted by our observation that the [Si] substitution features prominently in enstatite-buffered experiments at high pressures and high a [...]...|$|R
