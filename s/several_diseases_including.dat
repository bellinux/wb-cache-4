25|$|In 1580, a miner named Adreas Berthold {{traveled}} around Germany selling Silesian terra sigillata {{made from a}} special clay dug from the hills outside the town of Striga, now Strzegom, Poland, and processed into small tablets. He promoted it as a panacea effective against every type of poison and <b>several</b> <b>diseases,</b> <b>including</b> plague. Berthold invited authorities to test it themselves. In two cases, physicians, princes and town leaders conducted trials involving dogs who were either given poison followed by the antidote or poison alone; the dogs who got the antidote lived and the dogs who got the poison alone died. In 1581, a prince tested the antidote on a condemned criminal, who survived.|$|E

2500|$|Gastric {{diseases}} {{refer to}} diseases affecting the stomach. Inflammation {{of the stomach}} by infection from any cause is called gastritis, and when including {{other parts of the}} gastrointestinal tract called gastroenteritis. When gastritis persists in a chronic state, it is associated with <b>several</b> <b>diseases,</b> <b>including</b> atrophic gastritis, pyloric stenosis, and gastric cancer. Another common condition is gastric ulceration, peptic ulcers. Ulceration erodes the gastric mucosa, which protects the tissue of the stomach from the stomach acids.

2500|$|The 19th century's {{research}} into lupus continued {{with the work}} of Sir William Osler who, in 1895, published the first of his three papers about the internal complications of erythema exudativum multiforme. [...] Not all the patient cases in his paper had SLE but Osler's work expanded the knowledge of systemic diseases and documented extensive and critical visceral complications for <b>several</b> <b>diseases</b> <b>including</b> lupus. Noting that many people with lupus had a disease that not only affected the skin but many other organs in the body as well, Osler added the word [...] "systemic" [...] to the term lupus erythematosus to distinguish this type of disease from discoid lupus erythematosus. Osler's second paper noted that reoccurrence is a special feature of the disease and that attacks can be sustained for months or even years. [...] Further study of the disease led to a third paper, published in 1903, documenting afflictions such as arthritis, pneumonia, the inability to form coherent ideas, delirium, and central nervous system damage as all affecting patients diagnosed with SLE.|$|E
