5|$|Carletonomys {{was found}} in {{association}} with remains of several other animals, including fishes, chelid turtles, frogs, birds, armadillos, and several rodents, including Reithrodon auritus, the coypu (Myocastor), both of which <b>still</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, the extinct echimyid Dicolpomys, and unidentified caviids and octodontids. C.cailoi probably lived in a wetland habitat under relatively warm and moist climatic conditions. Although the limited material known permits few inferences as to the animal's natural history, it likely fed on hard plant material, as do related, morphologically similar extant species.|$|E
5|$|Modern day native {{groups such}} as the Yurok, Tolowa, Karok, Chilula, and Wiyot all have {{historical}} ties to the region, and some Native American groups <b>still</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park area today. Archaeological study shows they arrived in the area as far back as 3,000 years ago. An 1852 census determined that the Yurok were the most numerous, with 55 villages and an estimated population of 2,500. They used the abundant redwood, which with its linear grain was easily split into planks, as a building material for boats, houses, and small villages. For buildings, the planks would be erected side by side in a narrow trench, with the upper portions bound with leather strapping and held by notches cut into the supporting roof beams. Redwood boards were used to form a shallow sloping roof.|$|E

25|$|The Jewish {{presence}} in the area declined {{following the end of}} World War II, with a number of Jews emigrating to Israel, and the majority leaving for New York. Though the main Jewish population that remained in Dublin have moved out to Terenure, just five kilometres (three miles) away, a small number <b>still</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, but their own shops, schools, and small businesses no longer exist.|$|E
25|$|A large {{percentage}} {{of the population of the}} Eastern Shore and Southern Maryland are descendants of British American ancestry. The Eastern Shore was settled by Protestants, chiefly Methodist and the southern counties were initially settled by English Catholics. Western and northern Maryland have large German-American populations. More recent European immigrants of the late 19th and early 20th century settled first in Baltimore, attracted to its industrial jobs. Many of their ethnic Italian, Polish, Czech, Lithuanian, and Greek descendants <b>still</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|E

25|$|Idaho {{prior to}} European {{settlement}} was inhabited solely by Native American peoples, {{some of which}} <b>still</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. In the early 19th century, Idaho was {{considered part of the}} Oregon Country, an area disputed between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. It officially became U.S. territory with the signing of the Oregon Treaty of 1846, but a separate Idaho Territory was not organized until 1863, instead being included for periods in Oregon Territory and Washington Territory. Idaho was eventually admitted to the Union on July 3, 1890, becoming the 43rd state.|$|E
25|$|The Turkish {{population}} {{refers to}} the number of ethnic Turkish people in the world. During the Seljuk (1037–1194) and Ottoman (1299-1923) eras ethnic Turks were settled across the lands conquered by the two empires. In particular, the Turkification of Anatolia (modern Turkey) {{was the result of the}} Battle of Manzikert in 1071 and the formation of the Sultanate of Rum. Thereafter, the Ottomans continued Turkish expansion throughout the regions around the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Consequently, today the Turkish people form a majority in Turkey and Northern Cyprus. There are also significant Turkish minorities who <b>still</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, the Caucasus, and the Levant, and North Africa.|$|E
25|$|There {{are about}} 140 tribes and clans in Libya. Family life is {{important}} for Libyan families, the majority of which live in apartment blocks and other independent housing units, with precise modes of housing depending on their income and wealth. Although the Libyan Arabs traditionally lived nomadic lifestyles in tents, they have now settled in various towns and cities. Because of this, their old ways of life are gradually fading out. An unknown small number of Libyans <b>still</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desert as their families have done for centuries. Most {{of the population has}} occupations in industry and services, and a small percentage is in agriculture.|$|E

25|$|In 1828, the Danubian Sich {{ceased to}} exist after it was pardoned by Emperor Nicholas I, and under amnesty settled {{on the shores of}} the Northern Azov between Berdyansk and Mariupol forming the Azov Cossack Host. Finally in 1862 they too {{migrated}} to the Kuban and merged with the Kuban Cossacks. The Kuban Cossacks served Russia's interests right up to the October Revolution and their descendants are now undergoing active regeneration both culturally and militarily. The 30,000 descendants of those cossacks who refused to return to Russia in 1828 <b>still</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Danube delta region of Romania, where they pursue the traditional Cossack lifestyle of hunting and fishing and are known as Rusnaks.|$|E
25|$|Its {{demographic}} legacy endured {{for several}} centuries after the Ottoman conquest in 1461, as {{a substantial number}} of Greek Orthodox inhabitants, usually referred to as Pontic Greeks, continued to live in the area during Ottoman rule, up until 1923, when they were deported to Greece. A few thousand Greek Muslims <b>still</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, mostly in the Çaykara-Of dialectical region to the southeast of Trabzon. Most are Sunni-Muslim, while there are some recent converts in the city and possibly a few Crypto-Christians in the Tonya/Gümüşhane area to the southwest of the city. Compared to most previously Greek cities in Turkey, a large amount of its Greek Byzantine architectural heritage survives as well.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 19thcentury, the Tinker family lived at Shepley Carr. Ebenezer Tinker was {{responsible}} for building Tinker's Monument near Hill Top above New Mill. Deeds held at the West Yorkshire Archive Centre in Wakefield suggest that the original house at Shepley Carr dates from the 16thcentury and was owned by the Armytage Family of Kirklees Hall. The house was owned by the Bentley family from 1947 until 2002 after Harry Lawton Bentley, a local textile manufacturer, bought the hamlet by auction. Family members <b>still</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hamlet. Shepley Carr is now owned and occupied by the Wimpenny family, who own the historic Huddersfield building firm of the same name. Locals believe that Oliver Cromwell marched his army through Shepley Carr during the English Civil War 1642–1649. Roundheads, as the soldiers were known, were probably in Kirkburton, and at Catlin or Catling (now Cat Hill) Hall near Penistone, the latter having a holding post in the cellars upon which royalist prisoners were chained. Inside the parish church at Upper Cumberworth, there is a chair that Oliver Cromwell is reputed to have sat in.|$|E

500|$|Molluscs {{have more}} varied forms {{than any other}} animal phylum. They include snails, slugs and other gastropods; clams and other bivalves; squids and other cephalopods; and other lesser-known but {{similarly}} distinctive subgroups. The majority of species <b>still</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oceans, from the seashores to the abyssal zone, but some form {{a significant part of}} the freshwater fauna and the terrestrial ecosystems. Molluscs are extremely diverse in tropical and temperate regions, but can be found at all latitudes. About 80% of all known mollusc species are gastropods. Cephalopoda such as squid, cuttlefish, and octopuses are among the neurologically most advanced of all invertebrates. The giant squid, which until recently had not been observed alive in its adult form, is one of the largest invertebrates, but a recently caught specimen of the colossal squid, [...] long and weighing , may have overtaken it.|$|E
