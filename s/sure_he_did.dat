5|$|James was not {{a perfect}} {{stand-in}} for Montgomery. He had lost a finger during the First World War, so a prosthetic had to be made. He had also never flown before, so the London Controlling Section's Dennis Wheatley took James up for a test flight to make <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not suffer from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily and smoked cigars, while Montgomery was a teetotaler and disliked smoking. The deception planners were worried that James might be spotted drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these hitches, and with Montgomery's approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James {{spent some time with}} the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms.|$|E
25|$|Cowan {{had a bad}} {{start to}} the series against Sri Lanka making 4 on his home turf in the first innings. Cowan made <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not have another failure in the second innings by posting 56 in an opening stand worth 132 with partner David Warner.|$|E
25|$|At Pegu, Nanda was {{particularly}} concerned that Ava {{had the support}} of the Shan states. To counter the manpower of Upper Burma, Nanda secretly ordered troops from Prome, Toungoo, Lan Na, Lan Xang and Siam during the dry season of 1583–84. To be <b>sure,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not trust his remaining vassals either, especially Minkhaung II of Toungoo, his other half uncle who once revolted against none other than Bayinnaung. As a result, Nanda built a series of canals between Toungoo and Pegu. In March 1584, armies from Prome, Toungoo, Lan Na, Lan Xang and Siam marched to Ava. Mingyi Swa was left with a sizable force to guard Pegu.|$|E

5000|$|She is Takeo's younger sister. Takako seems {{annoyed by}} her brother's eccentricities and makes <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> regular {{exercise}} routines.|$|R

500|$|For the PSP version, {{the music}} was remixed by Toshiki Konishi, Ryota Kozuka and Atsushi Kitajoh, who also worked on the remixed music for Innocent Sins port. The team, while {{remixing}} the music, {{did not want to}} destroy the original's foundation. The ruling concept, as defined by Konishi, was [...] "not to far and not too close to the original". For the opening animation, Meguro requested Konishi to personally remix the game's original opening theme. It {{was the first time he}} had been put in charge of an opening theme, and it proved troublesome for him, as he needed to rerecord the vocals and make <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> justice to the original version. For Kitajoh, one of the most notable arrangements he did was for [...] "Maya's Theme": Meguro, who had previously remixed this track for Persona 3: FES, asked for a remix with a faster tempo and incorporated hard rock elements. The new scenario also used remixed music from the original game instead of new tracks.|$|E
2500|$|Turning to the {{particular}} facts of this case, the Court commented that the district judge had committed no significant procedural error. [...] He correctly calculated the Guidelines range, considered the statutory factors, and [...] "thoroughly documented his reasoning." [...] In particular, the judge did not ignore {{the seriousness of the}} offense. [...] To be <b>sure,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not specifically recite the adverse health effects that ecstasy presents. [...] Yet the prosecutor did not urge those adverse health consequences as a basis for imposing the sentence it felt was reasonable. [...] "It was not incumbent upon the District Judge to raise every conceivably relevant issue on his own initiative." [...] Moreover, the probation-only sentence in this case promotes respect for the law. [...] Seven of the eight defendants in the case received prison terms. [...] Gall did not because, as the district judge explained, [...] "a sentence of imprisonment may work to promote not respect, but derision, of the law if the law is viewed merely as a means to dispense harsh punishment without taking into account the real conduct and circumstances in sentencing." [...] Finally, Gall understandably received a more lenient sentence because he withdrew from the conspiracy while the other defendants did not.|$|E
60|$|Rollo looked concerned, {{and said}} he was <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not know it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] I said. [...] "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>He</b> <b>does!</b> <b>He</b> loves {{every living}} thing. Even sinful men. How much more the animals, that cannot sin!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense! <b>He</b> <b>does</b> {{not care}} about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not. <b>He</b> would <b>do</b> any good to her, or her family; but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> <b>He</b> {{desired to}} see baby, {{and he wants}} you, nurse. Only mind you command yourself--don't say a word you can help--do nothing to agitate him." ...|$|R
60|$|The head groom had {{actually}} been at Church, and looked quite the gentleman, though to be <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> stare about wonderfully.|$|E
60|$|I think Selim the Fisherman {{sent for}} Selim the Baker {{and made him}} rich and happy--I hope he did--I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Hugh--the man {{who sold}} him--he knew {{the horse was}} dangerous. I'm <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> from {{something}} {{he said to me}} while you were gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Robert, how can {{you talk}} so? I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not cry more than other children. Nurse says {{he is the best}} child she ever knew." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why to be <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does!</b> And, oh, let me {{tell you}} something! Dora {{told me that he was}} terribly angry over having been sent to Chicago on a wild-goose chase." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I have,--but I {{have seen}} no one {{belonging}} to him. Don't {{you understand what}} I mean? I feel all at sea about him. I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not mean any harm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no,' said Uncle Bat, 'I'm <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not; nor he won't long at the Admiralty either, I {{can tell}} them that. But where's Gertrude?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's strange," [...] {{returned}} Sam, [...] "I have seldom {{spoken to}} the man. Are you <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not send you for some one else--one of his mess-mates?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Harry {{can talk}} nothing but sailors' language," [...] said Flora, [...] "and I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not learn that of Mr. Ernescliffe. You never hear slang from him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>he's</b> <b>done</b> {{very well}} as he is for all these years," [...] she said, [...] "and {{if he could have}} a voice in the matter, I'm quite <b>sure</b> that <b>he</b> would prefer his daughters' {{education}} to his own removal." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{received}} {{a very kind}} letter from Godwin, in which {{he says that he}} never thinks of you but with a brother's feeling of love and expectation. Indeed, I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> I {{have seen}} {{as much as}} that myself, and I think I know some one with whom he likes to dance." [...] And the mother gave the {{daughter}} a loving little squeeze.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No {{one knows}} it. Don't look towards me; look towards him. He will turn {{his face in}} a moment. No one knows it, but I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> You are?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gone {{north of}} Charles Town," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "that's bad, bedad, that's very bad. You are <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not sail southward?" [...] he asked of {{the captain of}} the brig.|$|E
60|$|He {{read the}} letter three times to be <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not mistake the {{delightful}} import. Then he rang the bell with a vivacity which had not characterised him for many a month.|$|E
6000|$|... "To be <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> I {{will assist}} you," [...] {{answered}} the former teacher readily, with a malicious gleam in his fishy eyes. [...] "I {{wish you had}} all three boys here, to tar them with the same brush." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not," [...] said Clara. Belton sat silent, {{with his}} eyes fixed upon the table, and with a dark frown upon his brow. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> long to quarrel with Captain Aylmer; but was still anxious, if it might be possible, to save himself from what he knew would be a transgression.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{ends with}} Julian {{walking out of}} town, dressed {{in a suit and}} tie, [...] "supervised" [...] by the town sheriff, mayor and barber so as to make <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not run away. It is assumed that he kills himself shortly afterwards, {{fulfilling}} his dream of [...] "going to the sea".|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm pretty <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> {{although}} he didn't ask any questions. He {{knew about the}} robbery, and he knew well enough that I didn't have any three hundred dollars of my own to give him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> I wish I'd known him. We {{need to know}} {{men like}} that in this pink-frosting playing at living we have in cities," [...] Claire said sweetly--not to Milt but to Jeff.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I am <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not. Had he done so {{it could}} not have been found among Mr. Usbech's papers; for, as far as I remember, the poor man never {{attended}} to any business after that day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Dick," [...] she said, [...] "there's {{not much}} comfort in that. Look at poor Bobby Surcingle, look at Oliver Semples and Victor Medallion; {{you could n't}} have better families. But if you 're <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> n't drink! Algy 'll laugh, of course; that does n't matter--he laughs at everything." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sure,</b> <b>he's</b> <b>done</b> some of {{the most}} despicable things on a show full of despicable things—including but not limited to fathering {{children}} by incest, attempting to murder a boy who discovered said incest, and the cold-blooded murder of one of his own cousins—but despite all that, the Kingslayer remains one of Game of Thrones most popular characters.|$|R
6000|$|... "All men {{who enter}} the forest are," [...] {{answered}} the oriole, positively. [...] "For they only come here to murder and destroy those who are helpless before their power, but have never harmed them in the least. If God loves the birds, as I am <b>sure</b> <b>He</b> <b>does,</b> why <b>do</b> you suppose <b>He</b> made their ferocious enemies, the men?" ...|$|R
