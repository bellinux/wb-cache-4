5|$|Because of {{the immense}} {{distances}} of most gamma-ray burst sources from Earth, {{identification of the}} progenitors, the systems that produce these explosions, is challenging. The association of some long GRBs with supernovae {{and the fact that}} their host galaxies are rapidly star-forming offer very strong evidence that long gamma-ray bursts are associated with massive stars. The most widely accepted mechanism for the origin of long-duration GRBs is the collapsar model, in which the core of an extremely massive, low-metallicity, rapidly rotating star collapses into a black hole {{in the final stages of}} its evolution. Matter near the star's core rains down towards the center and swirls into a high-density accretion disk. The infall of this material into a black hole drives a pair of relativistic jets out along the rotational axis, which pummel through the <b>stellar</b> <b>envelope</b> and eventually break through the stellar surface and radiate as gamma rays. Some alternative models replace the black hole with a newly formed magnetar, although most other aspects of the model (the collapse of the core of a massive star and the formation of relativistic jets) are the same.|$|E

50|$|The {{horizontal}} branch (HB) is {{a stage of}} stellar evolution that immediately follows the red giant branch in stars whose masses {{are similar to the}} Sun's. Horizontal-branch stars are powered by helium fusion in the core (via the triple-alpha process) and by hydrogen fusion (via the CNO cycle) in a shell surrounding the core.

By expanding and cooling slightly, the layer in the opacity bump becomes more opaque, absorbs more radiation, and heats up. This heating causes expansion, further cooling and the layer becomes even more opaque. This continues until the material opacity stops increasing so rapidly, at which point the radiation trapped in the layer can escape. The star contracts and the cycle prepares to commence again. In this sense, the opacity acts like a valve that traps heat in the star's envelope.|$|E

50|$|Working {{together}} with Kip Thorne in 1976, Żytkow developed a theoretical {{model for a}} new star type, the Thorne-Żytkow object (TŻO), which contains either a neutron star or a black hole core {{at the center of}} a <b>stellar</b> <b>envelope.</b> The evolution of such a star occurs rarely and only two processes exist that define the structure and evolution of a TŻO. In the first process a collision between a neutron star and a normal star, either dwarf or giant, must occur in order to merge the two into a single object. This occurrence is rare since stars do not usually collide with each other. This could only happen in a dense cluster of stars. The second possible evolution of a larger TŻO can occur when a star expands into a red supergiant a and engulfs its companion neutron star.|$|E
50|$|The donor's core {{does not}} {{participate}} in the expansion of the <b>stellar</b> <b>envelope</b> and the formation of the common envelope, and the common envelope will contain two objects: the core of the original donor and the companion star. These two objects (initially) continue their orbital motion inside the common envelope. However, it is thought that because of drag forces inside the gaseous envelope, the two objects lose energy, which brings them in a closer orbit and actually increases their orbital velocities. The loss of orbital energy is assumed to heat up and expand the envelope, and the whole common-envelope phase ends when either the envelope is expelled into space, or the two objects inside the envelope merge and no more energy is available to expand or even expel the envelope. This phase of the shrinking of the orbit inside the common envelope is known as a spiral-in.|$|E

This is believed to be caused by thermal pulses, where the helium shell reignites the outer hydrogen shell. This changes the structure of the star, which manifests itself as a change in period. This process is predicted to happen to all Mira variables, but the relatively short duration of thermal pulses (a few thousand years at most) over the asymptotic giant branch lifetime of the star (less than a million years), means we only see it in a few of the several thousand Mira stars known, possibly in R Hydrae.

In these stars, the subgiant phase occurs within a few million years, causing an apparent gap in theHertzsprung-Russell diagram between B-type main-sequence stars and the RGB seen in young open clusters such as Praesepe.

40|$|The collapsar model {{explains}} {{the association of}} long duration gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) with stellar collapse. It involves a relativistic jet that forms {{at the core of}} a collapsing massive star. The jet penetrates the <b>stellar</b> <b>envelope</b> and the prompt GRB emission is produced once the jet is well outside the star. Most current models for generation of relativistic jets involve Poynting flux dominated outflows. We explore here the propagation of such a jet through a <b>stellar</b> <b>envelope.</b> The jet forms a bow shock around it. Energy dissipation at the head of this shock supplies energy to a cocoon that surrounds the jet. This cocoon exerts pressure on the jet and collimates it. While this description resembles the propagation of a hydrodynamic jets there are significant qualitative differences. Two Strong shocks, the reverse shock that slows down the hydrodynamic jet and the collimation shock that collimates it, cannot form within the Poynting flux dominated jet. As a result this jet moves much faster and dissipates much less energy while it crosses the <b>stellar</b> <b>envelope.</b> We construct here a simple analytic model that explores, self consistently, the jet-cocoon interaction and dynamics. Using this model we determine the properties of the jet, including its velocity, propagation time and shape. Comment: 31 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
