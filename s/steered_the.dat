5|$|Aberhart's {{government}} was re-elected in the 1940 election with a reduced majority of 36 of 63 seats. Among the defeated incumbents were dissident leader Brown, the convicted Unwin, the expelled Barnes, and the Provincial Treasurer Low. Aberhart won re-election by running in Calgary; his replacement as Social Credit candidate in Okotoks–High River was soundly defeated. Aberhart died in 1943 {{and was replaced}} as Premier by Ernest Manning, who <b>steered</b> <b>the</b> Social Credit League in a more conservative and conventional direction until his 1968 retirement.|$|E
5|$|After a {{promising}} {{start to the}} 1996–97, Everton were beaten six {{times in a row}} after Christmas and Southall resorted to ringing up a phone-in radio show to defend manager Joe Royle from unhappy supporters. Royle dropped Southall from the team despite the show of support, though he rejected a transfer offer from Chelsea, who were prepared to double Southall's wages. Caretaker-manager Dave Watson restored Southall to the starting line-up after Royle's resignation, and <b>steered</b> <b>the</b> club away from relegation.|$|E
5|$|Norwich re-appointed Gunn {{as manager}} for the 2009–10 season. Crook, as first team coach, and former Canary Ian Butterworth, as {{assistant}} manager, completed the management team. Over the summer, Gunn signed 12 players, most of those on free transfers, including Australian Michael Theoklitos, a goalkeeper from Melbourne Victory. He then <b>steered</b> <b>the</b> club through a programme of pre-season friendly matches, in which Norwich was unbeaten.|$|E

5|$|A {{powerful}} ridge {{over the}} central Atlantic <b>steered</b> <b>the</b> nascent storm westward toward the Lesser Antilles. Thunderstorm activity was strong near the center, although initially somewhat disorganized and asymmetric. However, a tight inner core soon took shape, and Gonzalo began to quickly intensify {{throughout the day}} on October 12. Following the appearance of an eye feature early the next day, the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane while located near Antigua in the eastern Caribbean. Shortly thereafter, the storm passed directly over the island. The hurricane later struck Saint Martin and Anguilla, and skirted {{just north of the}} British Virgin Islands while continuing to intensify. By that time, it was headed toward the northwest around the periphery of the aforementioned ridge.|$|E
5|$|A second {{emigrant}} ship—the Kennersley Castle, a merchantman docked at Leith, near Edinburgh—was {{hired by}} MacGregor in October 1822, and left Leith on 22 January 1823 with almost 200 emigrants aboard. MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard {{to see that}} they were well quartered; to their delight, he announced that since this was the maiden emigrant voyage from Scotland to Poyais, all the women and children would sail free of charge. The Cazique was rowed back to shore to rousing cheers from his colonists. The ship's captain Henry Crouch fired a six-gun broadside salute, hoisted the supposed flag of Poyais, then <b>steered</b> <b>the</b> ship out of port.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to manage Oxford in February 2000, and <b>steered</b> <b>the</b> club away from relegation in 1999–2000 before resigning in October 2000. In October 2001 {{he was appointed}} manager of Wrexham, {{but was unable to}} steer the club away from relegation in 2001–02. He won promotion from the Third Division at the first attempt in 2002–03, but Wrexham entered administration in December 2004 and the resulting points deduction saw them relegated once more. Despite the financial problems he managed the club to the Football League Trophy title in 2005, in addition to two successive FAW Premier Cup wins in 2002 and 2003. He was dismissed in January 2007, months after the club exited administration. He married in October 1967 and has three children.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Gilma {{originated}} from a tropical wave that moved {{off the coast}} of Africa and traversed the Atlantic Ocean during the second week of July 1994. The wave was of little note until it crossed Central America and entered the Northeastern Pacific hurricane basin on July15–16. Convection began to increase; however, the system remained disorganized. Tracking westward, gradual development took place, leading to the Dvorak classification being initiated on July20. Several hours later, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) designated the system as Tropical Depression Seven-E. A strong ridge situated north of the depression <b>steered</b> <b>the</b> system steadily westward. This movement would remain the same throughout most of the storm's existence. The depression was initially hard to locate due to its large size.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1942, 10 Norwegian ships at Gothenburg made {{an attempt}} to escape into Allied-controlled waters, {{where they would be}} met and {{protected}} by a group of British warships. However, Sweden would not allow the Norwegian ships to use their neutral waters for this, and Swedish ships <b>steered</b> <b>the</b> escapees towards waiting German warships. Of the 10, two made it through to the British, six were sunk by the Germans or scuttled by their crew, of which Skytteren was one, two turned back to Gothenburg. Skytteren was scuttled in the waters off Måseskär, Sweden. Her crew were taken as prisoners of war. The wreck of Skytteren remains in those waters, with her bow facing to the west.|$|E
5|$|On August14, 2015, a {{well-defined}} tropical wave, accompanied by significant surface pressure falls, traversed Western Africa and emerged over the Atlantic Ocean that evening. A broad surface low developed along the wave on August15. Embedded within monsoon flow, various environmental factors enabled gradual {{development of the}} disturbance, including low wind shear, above-average sea surface temperatures, moderate moisture content, and favorable diffluence. A subtropical ridge to the north <b>steered</b> <b>the</b> system generally west-northwest throughout its entire existence. On August17, the surface low became increasingly defined and convection more persistent. It subsequently acquired enough organization to be classified a tropical depression—the fourth of the 2015season—at 06:00UTC on August18. At this time, it was situated about 825mi (1,325km) west-southwest of Praia, Cape Verde.|$|E

5|$|On October11, 2015, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather traversed Central America {{and emerged}} over the eastern Pacific Ocean. The disturbance moved slowly {{over the next few}} days, later merging with a tropical wave on October15. The merger of these systems and the effects of a concurrent Tehuantepec gap wind event spurred the formation of a broad area of low pressure. This feature gradually consolidated and became a tropical depression shortly after 00:00UTC on October20; at this time the depression was situated roughly 205mi (335km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. A mid-level ridge to the north <b>steered</b> <b>the</b> depression generally west and later pulled it north along an arcing path.|$|E

The new House of Commons had more Conservative than Whig members, but the depth of the Tory schism enabled Russell to continue to govern.

5|$|The {{origins of}} Imbudo {{were from a}} disorganized area of {{convection}} near Chuuk in the open western Pacific in mid-July. With weak wind shear, the system slowly became better organized. On July15, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression formed. The next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert (TCFA), noting that outflow had increased due to an upper-level low to the northeast. At 1800UTC on July16, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 09W about 665km (415mi) east of Yap. A subtropical ridge near Okinawa <b>steered</b> <b>the</b> nascent depression to the west-northwest for much of its duration. With warm waters and favorable upper-level conditions, the depression quickly organized, and the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Imbudo on July17.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to Koni developed {{as an area}} of deep convection within an active monsoon trough well south of Guam on July12. Though atmospheric conditions were favorable for tropical cyclogenesis, the tropical disturbance failed to maintain consistent shower activity. Late on July14, however, the system developed organized rainbands. This prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) to classify {{the system as a}} tropical depression at 0000UTC on July15, well north of Palau. Shortly after, the storm entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA), immediately classifying the system as a tropical depression and designating it with the name Gilas; the JTWC later classified the system as such at 1200UTC that day. A subtropical ridge to the north <b>steered</b> <b>the</b> depression westward for much of its initial stages.|$|E
