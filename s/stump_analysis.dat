500|$|After {{graduating from}} UW in 1972 Bundy joined Governor Daniel J. Evans' reelection campaign. Posing {{as a college}} student, he shadowed Evans's opponent, former {{governor}} Albert Rosellini, recording his <b>stump</b> speeches for <b>analysis</b> by Evans's team. After Evans's reelection he was hired {{as an assistant to}} Ross Davis, Chairman of the Washington State Republican Party. Davis thought well of Bundy, describing him as [...] "smart, aggressive... and a believer in the system". In early 1973, despite mediocre Law School Admission Test scores, Bundy was accepted into the law schools of UPS and the University of Utah on the strength of letters of recommendation from Evans, Davis, and several UW psychology professors.|$|R
40|$|Decomposition of wood is an {{important}} component of global carbon cycling. Most wood decomposition models are based on tree characteristics and environmental conditions; however, they do not include community dynamics of fungi which are the major wood decomposers. We examined the factors explaining variation in sapwood decay in oak tree stumps 2 and 5 years after cutting. Wood moisture content was significantly correlated with sapwood decay in younger stumps, whereas ITS-based composition and species richness of the fungal community were the best predictors for mass loss in the older <b>stumps.</b> Co-occurrence <b>analysis</b> showed that in freshly cut trees and in younger stumps fungal communities were non-randomly structured, whereas fungal communities in old stumps could not be separated from a randomly assembled community. These results indicate that the most important factors explaining variation in wood decay rates can change over time and that the strength of competitive interactions between fungi in decaying tree stumps may level off with increased wood decay. Our field analysis further suggests that ascomycetes may have a prominent role in wood decay, but their wood-degrading abilities need to be further tested under controlled conditions. The next challenging step will be to integrate fungal community assembly processes in wood decay models to improve carbon sequestration estimates of forests. Read More: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is {{evaluating}} the impact of stump length of unilateral below knee amputees (BKA) on different gait parameters. Nine unilateral BKA were chosen and divided into three groups comprising patients with short, medium, and long stump length. Each of them underwent gait analysis test by Computer Dynography (CDG) system to measure the gait parameters. It was found that the ground reaction force is higher in the patients with medium stump length whereas the velocity, step length both for the prosthetic and sound limb and cadence were high in longer <b>stump</b> length. Statistical <b>analysis</b> shows a significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the gait parameters of BKA with medium and longer stump length. The patients with longer stump length were more efficient than medium and short stump patients as they consumed comparatively lesser energy while walking with self-selected velocity and conventional (Solid ankle cushioned heel) SACH foot...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of forest regeneration to canopy gap formation {{plays a key}} role in forest stand dynamics and future species composition of mesic forests. Results from controlled, replicated experiments, however, are limited. We measured light environment and extension growth for saplings and stump sprouts in and around experimentally harvested canopy gaps two years after formation to evaluate the initial {{response of}} shade tolerant sugar maple (Acer saccharum) versus mid-tolerant bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis) and white ash (Fraxinus americana). Gap areas (projected) ranged from 9 to 443 m≤ and were chosen to represent the typical range found in old-growth forests of the Great Lakes region. No saplings (3 ̆e 0. 5 cm dbh) were browsed by deer, but because of heavy browsing on <b>stump</b> sprouts, <b>analysis</b> of extension growth on sprouts was restricted to a subset of plots fenced to exclude deer. Surprisingly, sugar maple saplings attained higher extension growth rates across all light conditions than the two mid-tolerant species (18. 2 vs. 13. 0 cm, respectively; p = 0. 004). Sugar maple sapling extension growth varied significantly as a function of pre-treatment growth rate and gap area (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). Extension growth of mid-tolerant saplings was not significantly correlated with any measured variable. However, stump sprouts grew two to five times faster than saplings (p 3 ̆c 0. 001), and unlike the trend among saplings, mid-tolerants grew faster than sugar maple (100. 1 vs. 67. 8 cm, respectively). Our results indicate that sugar maple saplings respond to canopy gap formation more quickly than midtolerant associates and that stump sprouts outgrew saplings considerably. In addition, the importance of stump sprouting to gap regeneration increased significantly in larger gaps because of harvest damage to saplings. However, saplings have an advantage of greater initial height, so future competitive status may depend on changes in relative growth rates over the next few decades...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The forelimb amputee poses many {{reconstructive}} {{challenges in}} the clinical setting, {{and there is a}} paucity of established surgical models for study. To further elucidate the pathogenic process in amputation neuroma formation, we created a reproducible, well-tolerated rabbit forelimb amputation model. Methods Upon approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, 5 New Zealand White rabbits underwent left forelimb amputation. During this initial surgery, the median, radial and ulnar nerves were transected 1. 6 - 2. 5 (mean 2. 0) cm distal to the brachial plexus, transposed onto the anterior chest wall and preserved at length. Six weeks subsequent to the amputation, the distal 5 mm of each neuroma was excised, and the remaining <b>stump</b> underwent histomorphometric <b>analysis.</b> Results The nerve cross sectional areas increased by factors of 1. 99, 3. 17, and 2. 59 in the median (p = 0. 077), radial (p Conclusion Given that the surgical model appears well-tolerated by the rabbits and that patterns of morphologic change are consistent and reproducible, we are encouraged to further investigate the utility of this model in the pathogenesis of neuroma formation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral oximetry and {{internal}} carotid artery stump pressures were measured during carotid endarterectomy to assess whether cerebral oximetry {{could be used as}} a nonin-vasive and reliable alternative to monitor cerebral blood flow and the need for selective carotid artery shunting. Carotid endarterectomy procedures were performed in 27 patients wherein a cerebral oximeter was placed on the ipsilateral forehead preopera-tively. Stump pressure data as well as cerebral oximetry readings at baseline and before and after carotid artery clamping were gathered. The differences between baseline and clamped carotid artery oximetry readings were calculated for each subject and divided by the baseline reading to provide an adjusted measure of percent oximetry change. This normalized percent change in cerebral oximetry readings was then correlated with stump pressure. Carotid artery stump pressures correlated closely with the normalized change in cerebral oximetry readings (r =- 0. 57, p = 0. 002). Based on the regression <b>analysis,</b> <b>stump</b> pressure readings of 50 and 25 mm Hg were predicted by at least a 15 % and 30 % drop in cerebral oximetry readings, respectively. Based on low intraoperative (continued on next page...|$|R
40|$|Poplar <b>stump</b> grinding: <b>analysis</b> of {{work time}} and costs. After {{harvesting}} and extracting poplar trees, the agricultural land should be restored for further cultivation {{by removing the}} root systems. This operation is done with extraction or stumps grinding using special machines. In Italy, the stumps grinding is actually the operation more practiced. This paper deals with an analysis of work time, productivity and costs of the poplar stumps grinding, performed by two different operators. The poplar plantation was established with Neva (Populus x euramericana) clone and was harvested in march 2012. The plantation was located in Monterotondo (Rome), inside the farm of the Agricultural Engineering Research Unit (CRA-ING). Inside of two experimental plots, of the unit surface area of 0. 66 ha, the diameters of all the stumps (220) has been measured {{in order to establish}} a correlation between the gross grinding time and the diameter of the grinded stump. The influence of diameter of stump on the grinding cycle time was assessed by a regression of the type T = A + Bx, where T is the gross time of grinding, A and B coefficients to be determined and x is the diameter of the stump. The resulted regressions were subjected to ANOVA test. The results showed an average work productivity of 111 stumps h- 1, with significant differences between operators that underlines the importance of experience and competence of the operator. The productivity obtained on stumps with small diameters (23 cm) can reach 157 stumps h- 1 for the expert operator, against 106 stumps h- 1 of a less expert operator. The economic analysis was assessed on a cost per stump and per hectare. In referring to the average of the stumps diameters in the experimental plots (30 cm), an average cost of 1. 57 € stump- 1 was calculated, corresponding to 522 € ha- 1, with a lower cost for expert operator corresponding to 424 € ha- 1 (1. 27 € stump- 1), and a higher cost for the other operator of € 620 ha- 1 (1. 86 € stump- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{and management of}} uterine smooth muscle tumors with uncertain malignant potential (STUMP) is often challenging, and genomic data on these lesions {{as well as on}} uterine smooth muscle lesions are limited. We tested the hypothesis that genomic profile determination by array-CGH could split STUMP into a benign group with scarce chromosomal alterations akin to leiomyoma and a malignant group with high chromosomal instability akin to leiomyosarcoma. Array-CGH genomic profile analysis was conducted for a series of 29 cases of uterine STUMP. A group of ten uterine leiomyomas and ten uterine leiomyosarcomas served as controls. The mean age was 50 years (range, 24 - 85) and the follow-up ranged from 12 to 156 months (average 70 months). Since STUMP is a heterogenous group of tumors with genomic profiles that can harbor few to many chromosomal alterations, we compared genomic indices in leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas and set a genomic index= 10 threshold. Tumors with a genomic index 10 represented STUMPs with recurrences and unfavorable outcomes. Hence, the genomic index threshold splits the STUMP category into two groups of tumors with different outcomes: a group comparable to leiomyomas and another similar to leiomyosarcomas, but more indolent. In our <b>STUMP</b> series, genomic <b>analysis</b> by array-CGH is an innovative diagnostic tool for problematic smooth muscle uterine lesions, complementary to the morphological evaluation approach. We provide an improved classification method for distinguishing truly malignant tumors from benign lesions within the category of STUMP, especially those with equivocal morphological features.

40|$|In this study, we have {{investigated}} the short- and long-term impact of toe clipping, a commonly used method for marking and simultaneously taking biopsies of pups, which is controversially discussed because of its potentially negative impact on animals. Furthermore, we have analysed animal welfare aspects such as health, behaviour, development, stress and detrimental effects in young animals and in adults after toe clipping at postnatal days 3 (P 3) and 7 (P 7). Our findings indicate that for both P 3 and P 7 pups amputations at the second phalange of one toe of each paw {{do not have any}} negative effects on growth and physical development and that the clipped pups do not suffer from rejection by their mother. Our data indicate that even though at both ages no abnormalities have been detected in histology, clipping at P 7 is the preferable age for an adequate marking mostly because of the small size of the toes at P 3. This was also confirmed by grip tests at the age of 12 weeks where P 3 animals had lower grip strength than control animals, whereas P 7 pups did not show any impairment. Hotplate tests indicated that toe clipping performed at P 3 and P 7 did not cause hyperalgesia at the amputation <b>stump.</b> Serum corticosterone <b>analysis</b> directly performed on P 7 pups after clipping indicated that major stress was provoked mainly through the handling and not because of the clipping itself. Taken together, these data lead to the conclusion that toe clipping is from a morphological, physiological and welfare point of view an acceptable method for marking and genotyping newborn mice...|$|R
