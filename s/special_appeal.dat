25|$|Although not {{a problem}} in recent cases, the amparo (a <b>special</b> <b>appeal</b> {{claiming}} a violation of constitutional rights) {{has been used by}} taking parents to block Hague proceedings indefinitely and remains a problem in at least three long-term cases.

25|$|The lack of {{implementing}} legislation integrating the Convention into the Mexican legal system remains a problem. The amparo (a <b>special</b> <b>appeal</b> claiming {{a violation of}} constitutional rights) {{has been used by}} taking parents to block Hague proceedings indefinitely. Six cases still active 18 months after filing had one or more amparos and 3 of those cases currently have amparos pending. One of the four cases resolved through the Convention process since the 2001 Report was published resulted in the denial of a return by the Mexican Supreme Court because six years had passed while the taking parent filed successive amparos after the original judge ordered the children returned.|$|E

25|$|Those {{cases that}} do {{result in a}} court hearing face further obstacles, {{including}} lengthy court delays. Lack of implementing legislation to integrate the Convention into the Mexican legal system remains a problem. The amparo (a <b>special</b> <b>appeal</b> claiming a violation of an individual's constitutional rights) {{has been used by}} taking parents to block Convention proceedings indefinitely pending a ruling by another court as to whether the parent's constitutional rights have been violated. In addition, Mexican courts are able to reconsider at any stage of the proceedings factual determinations made by lower courts, producing additional delay. Both problems highlight {{the degree to which the}} lack of implementing legislation in Mexico has hampered the Convention’s effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Various {{researchers}} {{argue that}} the overall tendency to exculpate Antonescu was endorsed by the ruling National Salvation Front and its successor group, later known as Social Democratic Party, who complemented an emerging pro-authoritarian lobby while depicting their common opponent King Michael and his supporters as traitors. Sections of both governing and opposition groups contemplated the idea of rehabilitating the wartime leader, and, in May 1991, Parliament observed {{a moment of silence}} in his memory. The perceived governmental tolerance of Antonescu's rehabilitation raised international concern and protests. In 1997, Romanian President Emil Constantinescu, a representative of the Democratic Convention, became the first Romanian officeholder to recognize Antonescu's complicity. Nevertheless, during the same period, Attorney General Sorin Moisescu followed a since-deprecated <b>special</b> <b>appeal</b> procedure to overturn sentences passed against Antonescu and other 1946 defendants, which he eventually withdrew.|$|E
25|$|The {{abduction}} of Cephalus had <b>special</b> <b>appeal</b> for an Athenian audience because Cephalus {{was a local}} boy, and so {{this myth}} element appeared frequently in Attic vase-paintings and was exported with them. In the literary myths Eos kidnapped Cephalus when he was hunting {{and took him to}} Syria. The second-century CE traveller Pausanias was informed that the abductor of Cephalus was Hemera, goddess of Day. Although Cephalus was already married to Procris, Eos bore him three sons, including Phaeton and Hesperus, but he then began pining for Procris, causing a disgruntled Eos to return him to her — and put a curse on them. In Hyginus' report, Cephalus accidentally killed Procris some time later after he mistook her for an animal while hunting; in Ovid's Metamorphoses vii, Procris, a jealous wife, was spying on him and heard him singing to the wind, but thought he was serenading his ex-lover Eos.|$|E

25|$|Christianity, {{especially}} Protestantism, had a <b>special</b> <b>appeal</b> to Koreans in the North. Between 1440 and 1560, {{there were}} migrations {{to the northern}} provinces, which were designed to strengthen the border. This created a society of mixed backgrounds without an aristocracy and without long-standing religious institutions. However, it did have a strong and ambitious merchant class, {{as well as a}} strong military tradition. Local elites gained administrative positions and adopted Confucian literati lifestyles but were unable to attain high-level positions. During Japanese colonial rule from 1910 to 1945, the North became the more industrial region of Korea. The area was highly receptive to Protestant missionaries in the late nineteenth century, who brought Western knowledge, and established hospitals and Western-style medical care, schools, and a window to the wider world. The middle-class elites sent their sons to the Protestant schools. In turn the sons became strong nationalists who considered the United States a rallying point in opposition to Japanese colonial imperialism. In a reversal of previous Southern dominance, the North produced many influential figures in Korean history. After 1945, when the Soviet Union and China established communist dominance in the North, most of the Christians fled to South Korea in pursuit of religious freedom.|$|E

Elaborated since the 1820s, this ideological construct effectively captured the ambivalent racism of Anglo-American society, which repressed Native spirituality and traditional customs while creating cultural space for the invented Indian of romantic imagination.

During the riots, Serbian civilians were killed, thousands of Serbs were forced to leave their homes, 935 Serb houses, 10 public facilities (schools, health care centers, and post offices) and 35 Serbian Orthodox church buildings were desecrated or destroyed, and six towns and nine villages were totally ethnically cleansed.

[...] Secondly, cases continue to experience lengthy court delays, especially due to the excessive use of a <b>special</b> <b>appeal</b> process (the [...] "amparo") to block Convention proceedings almost indefinitely, and also due to the ability of the Mexican courts to reconsider factual determinations made by a lower court. [...] These case delays could be dealt with through the passage of implementing legislation to integrate the Convention into the Mexican legal system, something that we have urged Mexico to do in the past. [...] Finally, Mexico has participated in Department-sponsored training and conferences, but the Government of Mexico (GOM) has not taken sufficient lead to broaden the amount of training offered within its borders to judges, or to provide additional resources to the Mexican Central Authority. [...] As a result, we continue to see Convention cases mishandled as custody cases and not strictly as Convention (i.e. habitual residence) determinations.
