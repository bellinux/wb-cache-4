5|$|In Germany, {{sugar levels}} {{at time of}} harvest are an {{important}} consideration in the wine's production with prädikat levels measuring the <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wine. Equally important to winegrowers is the balance of acidity between the green tasting malic acid and the more citrus tasting tartaric acid. In cool years, some growers will wait until November to harvest in hopes of having {{a higher level of}} ripeness and subsequent tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|Andjar {{directed}} two further {{films for}} South Pacific, Anggrek Bulan and Gadis Desa (Maiden from the Village; 1949). Ratna had no further acting roles, although in 1950 she became Indonesia's first female director with Sedap Malam (<b>Sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Night), for Djamaluddin Malik's company Persari. Ali, Iskandar, and Djauhari remained active as actors, Ali and Iskandar through the 1960s and Djauhari until the 1970s. SPFC made another six films before shutting {{down at the}} end of the Indonesian National Revolution in 1949. A 35mm copy of Djaoeh Dimata is stored at Sinematek Indonesia in Jakarta.|$|E
5|$|As bacon {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of the bacon highlights the <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, the bacon should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of sweetening the bacon, {{in a similar manner}} to pancakes {{in some parts of the}} United States.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> scent <b>of</b> {{liquorice}} root {{comes from a}} complex and variable combination of compounds, of which anethole is up to 3% of total volatiles. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> in liquorice comes from glycyrrhizin, which has a sweet taste, 30–50 times <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> sugar. <b>The</b> <b>sweetness</b> {{is very different from}} sugar, being less instant, tart, and lasting longer.|$|R

5|$|Andjar's {{screenplay}} Dr Samsi {{was finally}} adapted {{as a film}} in 1952 by Ratna Asmara, who had become Indonesia's first female film director with her 1950 film Sedap Malam (<b>Sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Night). The adaptation starred Ratna and Raden Ismail. It would prove Andjar's last screenwriting credit during his lifetime. Although no longer writing films, Andjar remained active in the country's film industry. In 1955 he headed the inaugural Indonesian Film Festival, which was criticized when it gave the Best Picture Award to two films, Usmar Ismail's Lewat Djam Malam (After the Curfew) and Lilik Sudjio's Tarmina. Critics wrote that Lewat Djam Malam was easily the stronger of the two and suggested that Djamaluddin Malik, Tarmina producer, had influenced the jury's decision.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace {{are usually not}} meant to be drunk young, but many are still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up the <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wine.|$|E
25|$|This {{does not}} {{necessarily}} determine the <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final wine, because the winemaker may choose to ferment the wine fully or let some residual sugar remain.|$|E

It {{suppresses}} <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sweeteners including intense artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and natural sweeteners such as thaumatin, a sweet protein. The anti-sweet activity is reversible, but sweetness recovery on the tongue can take more than 10 minutes.|$|R
40|$|Chocolate can be {{described}} as a suspension consisting of non-fat particles (sugar, cocoa solids and milk powder particles) dispersed in cocoa butter and a portion of milk fat as a continuous phase. Its unique pleasant taste is produced by a complex interaction of odour-active volatile compounds, which are supplementary to <b>the</b> fine bitterness <b>of</b> cocoa and <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> sugar. <b>The</b> characteristically pleasant mouth-feel is produced by <b>the</b> melting behaviour <b>of</b> cocoa butter, its flavour release and <b>the</b> rheological properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> melting mass...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> sugar (dosage) added {{after the}} second {{fermentation}} and aging varies and will dictate <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sparkling wine.

25|$|Sri-Nuan is {{a typical}} dance of central Thailand. Its great {{popularity}} {{is due to the}} choreography and the <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music that accompanies it.

25|$|Because Madeira has a {{very high}} acidity, it can be paired with any food, even citrus or balsamic. Also, {{although}} it is sweet, even the Malmsey has a dry finish, so it does not get killed by the sweetness of desserts and pudding. This makes it the most versatile of all dessert wines. Whereas most sweet wines are rendered dry by the <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dessert, this does not happen with Madeira.|$|E

40|$|Inulin is a {{polysaccharide}} {{contained in}} chicory, dahlia, and other plants. An oligosaccharide DFA III is produced from inulin using a microbial enzyme, inulin fructotransferase (DFA III producing) [EC 2. 4. 1. 93].

25|$|The acidity in wine is an {{important}} component in the quality and taste of the wine. It adds a sharpness to the flavors and is detected most readily by a prickling sensation {{on the sides of the}} tongue and a mouth-watering aftertaste. Of particular importance is the balance of acidity versus the <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wine (the leftover residual sugar) and the more bitter components of the wine (most notably tannins but also includes other phenolics). A wine with too much acidity will taste excessively sour and sharp. A wine with too little acidity will taste flabby and flat, with less defined flavors.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{winemaking}} {{steps of}} Madeira start out {{like most other}} wines: grapes are harvested, crushed, pressed, and then fermented in either stainless steel or oak casks. The grape varieties destined for sweeter wines – Bual and Malvasia – are often fermented on their skins to leach more phenols from the grapes to balance the <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wine. The more dry wines – made from Sercial, Verdelho, and Negra Mole – are separated from their skins prior to fermentation. Depending {{on the level of}} sweetness desired, fermentation of the wine is halted at some point by the addition of neutral grape spirits.|$|E
500|$|Hops contain several {{characteristics}} that brewers desire in beer. Hops contribute a bitterness that balances the <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> malt; {{the bitterness of}} beers is measured on the International Bitterness Units scale. Hops contribute floral, citrus, and herbal aromas and flavours to beer. Hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewer's yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in [...] "head retention", {{the length of time}} that a foamy head created by carbonation will last. The acidity of hops is a preservative.|$|E
25|$|Some {{producers}} {{also use}} additional propriate designations to denote quality or ripeness level within a Prädikat.

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{methods used to}} carry out this {{secondary}} fermentation. The most well known is the Traditional or [...] "Champagne method" [...] where the base cuvee is bottled with a mixture of sugar and yeast. <b>The</b> introduction <b>of</b> a fresh yeast and food source (the sugar) triggers the fermentation process in the bottle that the wine will eventually be sold in. Through <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> riddling and eventually disgorgement, the dead yeast cells (lees) are removed from the wine while still maintaining the dissolved carbon dioxide gas. A dosage mixture of fresh wine and some sugar syrup is used to adjust <b>the</b> <b>sweetness</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wine after it has been disgorged.|$|R
500|$|Bach {{had taken}} up his tenure as Thomaskantor in Leipzig in 1723. During his first year there he {{composed}} a first cantata cycle for almost all occasions of the liturgical year. The second year he composed a cycle of mostly chorale cantatas, based on Lutheran hymns. The third year, Bach began a third cycle but wrote the works more irregularly. [...] was from a later incomplete cycle, which the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff calls the Picander cycle, after the librettist Picander with whom Bach had collaborated already for the St Matthew Passion, and worked together for several years. The preface of Picander's 1728 collection of cantata texts written for Bach said that [...] "lack of poetic elegance would be compensated for by the <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incomparable Kapellmeister Bach".|$|E

This time, he's willing {{to go all the}} way and sell out Dwight, his most loyal friend. It's a little jarring." [...] Leitch, however, said the <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subplot involving Kevin and Lynne offset some of the darker aspects of the episode, and praised several of the jokes including Michael's [...] "Shoe-La-La" [...] shoe store idea, Dwight's idea for a [...] "Horse Boat" [...] invention and the KGB knock knock jokes.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{separated}} {{for the first}} time the learned liking for a particular level <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> in a familiar drink from the infantile delight in sweetness as such (“the sweeter, the better”). It is widely assumed that sensing a liked food or drink evokes a pleasurable experience, but the only psychological evidence for this assumption has been tongue movements that are elicited specifically by sweet taste in animals and human neonates. We found that adults felt such movements in response to drinking juice at both their personally preferred level <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> and levels they deemed so sweet as to be undrinkable. Yet only the intolerably strong level <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> elicited enjoyment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experienced movements, elevation of mood, and a sense <b>of</b> smiling. Hence, <b>the</b> pleasure that adults experience during ingestion could be exclusively linked with the congenital sweetness reflex that sends mother’s milk down an infant’s throat...|$|R
500|$|Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia was {{performed}} during the Venice Carnival of 1640–41, at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo where it alternated with {{a revival of}} Ulisse. According to Carter the work was fairly undemanding {{in terms of its}} staging, the action taking place mainly {{on the banks of the}} Tiber with few changes of set. There is no record of the Venetian public's response to the opera that, Rosand asserts, was clearly aimed at their patriotic impulses, with its final scene a celebration of [...] "the birth and marvels of the city of Venice". [...] In a preface published with the libretto, Torcigliani refers to [...] "the <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music of the never-enough praised Monteverde", but the libretto itself provides no specific guides to the music's nature. Ringer records with regret that [...] "he words are all that remain of this Virgilian opera, offering faint hints of lost melodies".|$|E
500|$|The {{symbolism}} in Winesburg, Ohio plays a {{large role}} in allowing for this reorientation. Beginning with the idea of characters as grotesques whose [...] "...grotesqueness is not merely a shield of deformity; it is also a remnant of misshapen feelings, what Dr. Reefy in the sketch 'Paper Pills' calls 'the <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twisted apples'". The irony of the sweet, but twisted (meaning, in the sentimental Victorian tradition, internally inferior), apples is that they are compared to Dr. Reefy's own knuckles that make a habit of stuffing crumpled notes bearing his thoughts unread into his pockets (itself a symbol of the [...] "ineffectuality of human thought"). Wing Biddlebaum, the subject of the story [...] "Hands", likewise was [...] "...forever striving to conceal [...] in his pockets or behind his back". [...] For Wing, his hands were [...] "...the very index of his humanity", with the potential to symbolize a continuum going from a general fear of sexuality to sublimated homosexuality. Wing Biddlebaum and Dr. Reefy are just two examples of how throughout Winesburg, Ohio, Anderson builds myriad themes by adding symbolic significance to gestures, weather conditions and time of day, and events, among other features of the stories.|$|E
500|$|Rinuccini {{extended}} the libretto during the rehearsals, after complaints from the duchess that {{the piece was}} [...] "too dry"; {{as a result the}} early scene between Venus and Cupid, and Jupiter's blessing from heaven, were added. Preparations for the opera's performance were disrupted when, in March 1608, the leading soprano Caterina Martinelli died of smallpox. A replacement had to be found rapidly, and the title role fell to Virginia Andreidi, a renowned actress-singer who used the stage name [...] "La Florinda"; she reportedly learned the part in only six days. In his analysis of Monteverdi's theatrical works, Carter suggests that the lament may {{have been added to the}} work to make the most of Andreini's acting and vocal abilities. The premiere, on 28 May 1608, was staged in a specially erected temporary theatre, which according to contemporary reports could hold an audience of several thousands. The production was lavish; apparently 300 men were required to manipulate the stage machinery. Federico Follino, who prepared the Mantuan court's official report on the occasion, praised the beauty of the work, the magnificence of costumes and machinery, and the <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music. Monteverdi's fellow-composer Marco da Gagliano was equally complimentary, writing that the opera had [...] "visibly moved the entire audience to tears." [...] It is possible that L'Arianna was performed in Florence in 1614; a projected performance in Mantua in May 1620 to celebrate Duchess Caterina's birthday was cancelled for unknown reasons. Otherwise, there are no records of the opera's performance before its revival in 1640 at the Teatro San Moisè, Venice. In his study of late Renaissance opera, Gary Tomlinson surmises that the work's enthusiastic reception in Venice was a significant factor in Monteverdi's decision to resume opera composition during his final years.|$|E
