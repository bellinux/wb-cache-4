50|$|Sorbic {{acid and}} its salts, such as <b>sodium</b> <b>sorbate,</b> {{potassium}} sorbate, and calcium sorbate, are antimicrobial agents {{often used as}} preservatives in food and drinks to prevent the growth of mold, yeast, and fungi. In general the salts are preferred over the acid form {{because they are more}} soluble in water, but the active form is the acid. The optimal pH for the antimicrobial activity is below pH 6.5. Sorbates are generally used at concentrations of 0.025% to 0.10%. Adding sorbate salts to food will, however, raise the pH of the food slightly so the pH may need to be adjusted to assure safety. It is found in many other foods, such as cheeses and breads.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of some food additives used in foods on cold tolerance of Clostridium perfringens at pH close to neutral. Maximal concentrations recommended for foods of <b>sodium</b> benzoate, potassium <b>sorbate,</b> <b>sodium</b> nitrite, monosodium glutamate, or mixtures of those were added to cultures and their effects on C. perfringens tolerance to 10 °C were evaluated. The effect of a previous shock at 28 °C was also determined. Growth of C. perfringens was not inhibited by the substances examined. Sodium nitrite, applied at maximal permitted concentrations, increased C. perfringens survival at 10 °C. Mixtures of GRAS compounds had either no clear effect, or increased tolerance to 10 °C. A pre-shock (28 °C) of the cultures treated with sodium benzoate, sodium nitrite or monosodium glutamate increased survival and stimulated growth of the cultures treated at 10 °C. We conclude that the addition of these compounds including <b>sodium</b> benzoate, potassium <b>sorbate,</b> <b>sodium</b> nitrite and monosodium glutamate to cultures of C. perfringens can influence their cold tolerance. In some cases, the substances that would normally eliminate microorganisms at lower pH, can increase tolerance of this bacterium, permitting survival at low temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the best preservative between potassium <b>sorbate,</b> <b>sodium</b> benzoate, and chitosan on the microbiological quality of Mozzarella cheese stored at refrigerator temperature. The results showed that the addition of preservatives potassium <b>sorbate,</b> <b>sodium</b> benzoate, and chitosan did not give a significantly different effect (P> 0. 05) on the TPC, total number of molds, and total number of yeasts of Mozzarella cheese. Storage time of Mozzarella cheese that nested on the type of added preservatives did not give a significantly different effect (P> 0. 05) on the TPC and total number of yeasts but gave a significantly different effect (P< 0. 05) on the number of molds of Mozzarella cheese. Based on the research data, it can be concluded that the utilization of preservative potassium <b>sorbate,</b> <b>sodium</b> benzoate, and chitosan were effective in suppressing the growth of microorganisms.

40|$|Background: Regarding {{the public}} health {{concerns}} {{over the use of}} food preservatives in yoghurt drink “Doogh", the aim of this study was the determination of <b>sodium</b> benzoate, potassium <b>sorbate</b> and natamycin in Doogh. Based on Iranian national standard, none of these preservatives are permitted to be used in Doogh. Methods: A total of 39 Doogh samples were analyzed through RP- HPLC in order to quantify <b>sodium</b> benzoate, potassium <b>sorbate</b> and natamaycin simultaneously. Exposure to each preservative is estimated by mean and maximum concentrations as the residue levels. The per capita Doogh consumption was calculated by the published data from official reports for Doogh annual production in Iran. Results: All samples were shown to contain sodium benzoate while natamaycin was detected in 10. 25 % of the samples and potassium sorbate was not detected in any of them. Sodium benzoate concentration extremely varied among the investigated samples ranged from 0. 94 to 9. 77 mg/l. Due to the result of the exposure estimation, no serious public health concern would exist regarding the mentioned preservatives. Conclusions: The detection of sodium benzoate in all Doogh samples could indicate the natural production of benzoic acid in yoghurt. Sodium benzoate may be formed through the interaction of the added food grade salt to the Doogh formula which contains benzoic acid. The results of exposure estimation show the lack of health risk within the usage of preservatives in spite of the national regulatory agencies does not permit the preservative use...|$|R

Microbial {{spoilage}} {{has been}} reported in various food products and this has led to increased food, fruit and beverage losses, thereby threatening economic growth, food safety and security.

The concentration of ascorbic acid, total vitamin C, benzoate, sorbate, and sulfur dioxide, and the juices' physicochemical properties were determined. UV treatment consisted of multiple passes at a fixed dose of 14  mJ cm− 2 per pass, achieved by adjusting the juice flow rate through the UV machine. Samples containing ascorbic acid were inoculated with Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (107  CFU ml− 1) and analyzed for microbial reduction due to UV. The addition of ascorbic acid, sorbate, and benzoate significantly increased juices' absorption coefficients, which caused a reduction in the juice flow rate (p    0. 05) but decreased sulfur dioxide, ascorbic acid, and particularly sorbate levels (p <  0. 05).

In addition, {{the effects of}} solutes and preservatives on colony formation by unheated and heated conidia of A. flavus were evaluated. Increased concentrations of sucrose were accompanied by increased tolerance to heat by A. flavus, B. nivea, and G. candidum. Low concentrations (3 and 6 %) of sodium chloride protected A. flavus and G. candidum, whereas up to 12 % sodium chloride protected B. nivea, but {{had little effect on}} the heat stability of P. puberulum. Potassium <b>sorbate</b> and <b>sodium</b> benzoate acted synergistically with heat to inactivate all four molds. At the same concentration, the two preservatives had varied degrees of effectiveness on molds and were influenced by the type of solute in the heating menstrua. Heated conidia of A. flavus had increased sensitivity to preservatives and reduced water activity, whether achieved by the presence of sucrose or sodium chloride, thus demonstrating heat-induced injury. At the same concentration, potassium sorbate was clearly more inhibitory than was sodium benzoate to colony formation by A. flavus, and the presence of sucrose and sodium chloride enhanced this inhibition...|$|R
30|$|The {{development}} of stable lyophilized laccase, obtained from Coriolus hirsutus, using {{a wide range}} of temperature treatments and storage conditions, was investigated. Using selected lyoprotectants, including, dextran 6  kDa, sucrose and a mixture of <b>sodium</b> benzoate, potassium <b>sorbate</b> and sorbitol (BKSS) (1.5 : 1.0 : 98.5; w/w/w) resulted by 2.4, 1.4 and 1.8 -fold increase in laccase activity after lyophilization as compared to the fresh enzyme, respectively, whereas the addition of mannitol preserved 98.2 % of its activity. Using 2.5 % (w/v) dextran (15 – 25  kDa) or mannitol appeared to be the most appropriate lyoprotectants for the laccase activity. The laccase stability of the lyophilized enzymatic extract was greatly enhanced with the presence of mannitol, with 96.2, 38.9 and 24.7 % of residual activity after 4  weeks of storage at −[*] 80, 4 and 25  °C, respectively. The inactivation constant (kinactivation) value and the amount required to decrease 50 % of the laccase activity (C 1 / 2) showed that Carbowax® polyethylene glycol (PEG)- 8000 was the most appropriate additive for laccase activity, followed by glycerol and CuSO 4. When the enzymatic extract was incubated at 50  °C in the presence of either CuSO 4, PEG- 8000 or glycerol, the time required to decrease 50 % of the laccase initial activity (t 50), were 52.9, 54.6, 50.2  h, respectively, as compared to that of the control trial of 38.9  h.|$|R
