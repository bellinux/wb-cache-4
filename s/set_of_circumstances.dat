5|$|Okada {{described}} the main theme as power achieved through intelligence and overcoming the environments. The main narrative featured multiple references to Chinese mythology, {{while many of}} the player characters drew from historical and literary figures from each country the game visited. The Hakke leaders of the Sangokai were designed around a particular part of their body being malformed. A narrative element carried over from the Megami Tensei franchise was a system of choices based on morality that influenced the ending; while these elements had been thoroughly explored in Megami Tensei, the team felt the themes still had potential and so used it in Maken X. The game was Atlus' first title to feature full voice acting; the team initially planned to voice event scenes in English and Chinese with Japanese subtitles, but included voice acting across the whole game due to positive feedback. A similar <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> led to the wide use of stereophonic sound across the whole game when it was initially planned only for action sequences.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} complexities {{human beings}} are facing through the technological transformation of the planetary biome has brought on the Anthropocene. The unique <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> has generated {{the need for a}} new unifying science called coupled human and natural systems that builds upon, but moves beyond the field of human ecology. Ecosystems tie into human societies through the critical and all encompassing life-supporting functions they sustain. In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems, there has been a surge of interest in social-natural capital, which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from ecosystem goods and services. Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world. Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they are the ultimate base foundation of global economics as every commodity, and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth.|$|E

25|$|The {{commission}} {{stressed that}} {{this decision was}} in response to a unique <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> external to the game rather than overruling an on-field umpiring decision; hence, no precedent was set for the overturning of results decided by controversial umpiring decisions, errors by goal umpires, etc. The key factor was that the timekeeper had not fulfilled his duties by failing to sound the siren continuously until the umpires acknowledged the end of the game. This prevented the umpires from being able to end the game at the correct time.|$|E
25|$|Another theory {{associates}} {{adult stem}} cells (ASC) with tumor formation. This is most often associated with tissues with {{a high rate of}} cell turnover (such as the skin or gut). In these tissues, ASCs are candidates because of their frequent cell divisions (compared to most ASCs) in conjunction with the long lifespan of ASCs. This combination creates the ideal <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> for mutations to accumulate: mutation accumulation is the primary factor that drives cancer initiation. Evidence shows that the association represents an actual phenomenon, although specific cancers have been linked to a specific cause.|$|E

25|$|Depending {{upon the}} format of the match, these two {{strategies}} will be given different weights. In an unlimited, timed or declaration match, the main aim of the bowling attack will be to take wickets, so attacking bowling and fielding strategies will be used. In a limited overs match, this aim will also be supplemented by the secondary need to prevent the batting side from scoring quickly, so more defensive strategies will be used. In general, the shorter the number of overs per side, the more priority will be given to this secondary target of maintaining a low run-rate. It is also highly probable that the need for attacking or defensive strategies can switch frequently as a cricket match progresses. It is the sign of a good cricket captain {{to be able to tell}} which strategy is most appropriate in any <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> and the best way of implementing it.|$|E
25|$|Although {{initially}} {{put off by}} Mrs Burton-Cox's attitude, Mrs Oliver {{decides to}} resolve the issue after consulting with Celia about her parents' death, and invites her friend Hercule Poirot to solve the disquieting puzzle. Together, they conduct interviews with several elderly witnesses associated with the case, whom they term “elephants”, based on the assumption that, like the proverbial elephants, they may have long memories. Each individual witness recalls a different <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances,</b> but Poirot notes two items of significance - the first being that Margaret Ravenscroft was seriously bitten by the otherwise devoted family dog a few days before her death, and that she had four wigs in her possession {{at the time of her}} death. Further investigation by himself and Mrs Oliver soon reveals that her maiden name was Preston-Grey, and that she had an identical twin sister called Dorothea. While Margaret led a fairly ordinary life, her sister spent protracted periods of her life in psychiatric nursing homes, after she was strongly suspected of being involved in two violent incidents: the first occurred in India when, following the death of her husband, Major Jarrow, Dorothea drowned their infant son and blamed it on an Indian ayah; the second occurred in Malaya when she was with the Ravenscrofts, in which she attacked the child of a neighbor of theirs. She soon joined them at their home in Overcliffe, whereupon she apparently sleep-walked off a cliff one evening and died; the deaths of Alistair and Margaret occurred less than a month after this.|$|E

500|$|... "I Want You", {{along with}} Jackson's other singles from Damita Jo and her {{following}} two albums, was blacklisted by many major radio formats following her controversial Super Bowl Halftime Show incident {{that resulted in}} several media conglomerates receiving massive U.S. Federal Communications Commission fines in its aftermath, such as Viacom, which owns many radio formats, MTV, and CBS, which broadcast the event and owns Clear Channel Communications. The blacklisting of Jackson drew attention and commentary from music critics, with many claiming the song would likely have achieved greater success if the blockage had not occurred. Glenn Gamboa of Newsweek stated, [...] "Unfortunately, it's not clear whether these songs will get heard," [...] saying after the incident, [...] "Jackson has been put in the pop culture penalty box. The result is that despite some initial backing for [...] "Just a Little While", radio and TV support for her music has withered, as the conglomerates worry about angering the FCC and Congress" [...] in fear of receiving fines for supporting Jackson.

500|$|The fair catch kick rule is {{very rarely}} invoked, {{and is one}} of the rarest plays in football. The rule has been {{regarded}} as [...] "obscure", [...] "bizarre", and [...] "quirky". [...] A unique <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> is required for a fair catch kick to be a viable option. For one, the fair catch would need to be made at a point on the field where a field goal attempt has a reasonable chance of being successful; most fair catches are made well outside of field goal range (even more so since 1974, when the goal posts were moved back to the end line, adding 10 yards to such attempts). Furthermore, for a fair catch kick to be a viable option near the end of the fourth quarter, the team attempting the kick needs to be either tied or behind by three points or fewer; even if a game is tied, a fair catch kick might be unpalatable, as it is possible the ball lands in the field of play and the opponent returns it for a touchdown (hence why, when the possibility of a 75-yard fair catch kick arose in Super Bowl LI, the idea was nixed). In exceptional circumstances a team might try the kick at the end of the first half if only a few seconds remained, but Art McNally, who led the officiating department of the National Football League from 1968 to 1990, notes that, even in the event a fair catch is made within field goal range, most teams would attempt to score a touchdown unless there is not enough time left to score one. Accordingly, most fair catch kick attempts occur when a team has fair-caught a ball from a punt from deep in their opponent's territory, and there is not enough time left in the half to go for a touchdown.|$|E

50|$|Posttraumatic growth {{occurs with}} the {{attempts}} to adapt to highly negative <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> that can engender high levels of psychological distress such as major life crises, which typically engender unpleasant psychological reactions.

Encouragingly, reports of growth experiences in the aftermath of traumatic events far outnumber reports of psychiatric disorders, since continuing personal distress and growth often coexist.|$|R
