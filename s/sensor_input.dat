50|$|A {{fundamental}} {{building block}} of an autonomic {{system is the}} sensing capability (Sensors Si), which enables the system to observe its external operational context. Inherent to an autonomic system is {{the knowledge of the}} Purpose (intention) and the Know-how to operate itself (e.g., bootstrapping, configuration knowledge, interpretation of sensory data, etc.) without external intervention. The actual operation of the autonomic system is dictated by the Logic, which is responsible for making the right decisions to serve its Purpose, and influence by the observation of the operational context (based on the <b>sensor</b> <b>input).</b>|$|E

The {{accuracy of the}} vehicle location is dependent of the digital map construction and {{the accuracy of the}} local map used to construct the digital map. The best hope for accuracy is 800 m. But accuracy of one car length in 35 km has been realized. The use of assembly language was necessitated to keep up with <b>sensor</b> <b>input.</b> One advantage with the system is the ability to create one's own digital maps and thus eliminate the need to buy such ones for every trip. The software to accomplish this task was written in Basic.|$|E
50|$|The correct {{operation}} of an SIS requires {{a series of}} equipment to function properly. It must have sensors capable of detecting abnormal operating conditions, such as high flow, low level, or incorrect valve positioning. A logic solver is required to receive the <b>sensor</b> <b>input</b> signal(s), make appropriate decisions based {{on the nature of}} the signal(s), and change its outputs according to user-defined logic. The logic solver may use electrical, electronic or programmable electronic equipment, such as relays, trip amplifiers, or programmable logic controllers. Next, the change of the logic solver output(s) results in the final element(s) taking action on the process (e.g. closing a valve) to bring it to a safe state. Support systems, such as power, instrument air, and communications, are generally required for SIS operation. The support systems should be designed to provide the required integrity and reliability.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{generation}} of Lego Mindstorms was built around a brick known as the RCX (Robotic Command eXplorers). It contains an 8-bit Renesas (then a part of Hitachi) H8/300 microcontroller as its internal CPU. It included 32K of RAM to store the firmware and user programs. The brick is programmed by uploading a program (written in one of several available programming languages) from a Windows or Mac computer to the brick's RAM via a special infrared (IR) interface. After the user starts a program, an RCX-enabled Mindstorms creation can function totally on its own, acting on internal and external stimuli according to the programmed instructions. Also, two or several more RCX bricks can {{communicate with each other}} through the IR interface, enabling inter-brick cooperation or competition. In addition to the IR port, the system includes three <b>sensor</b> <b>input</b> ports and three motor output ports (which {{can also be used to}} drive other electrical devices such as lamps and so forth). A built-in LCD can display the battery level, the status of the input/output ports, which program is selected or running, and other information.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} {{renovation}} work done during refueling and overhauls of submarines is {{the conversion of}} a fleet ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) to a guided missile submarine (SSGN). Such a conversion consists of taking the 24 ballistic missiles and their silos out of the missile section in the submarine, and replacing them with 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles and special operations force insertion platforms which can carry up to 66 special operations personnel. The first four s have undergone such conversions during their midlife refueling and overhauls. [...] For more details, see [...]During an overhaul, an extensive testing program is conducted. Numerous test procedures that have been written are followed, data is recorded as required, and logs of the testing are kept. Tests that can be conducted include: radiography to test critical welds, testing of fluid systems and other pressure boundaries which includes hydrostatic testing to detect any leaks, and testing of electrical and mechanical setpoints for various types of equipment such as <b>sensor</b> <b>input</b> setpoints for various kinds of automatic trips and safety valve relief pressure setpoints. At the finish of the ROH, the testing data records are bound and retained as a permanent documentation record resulting from the ROH.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice in}} HEI system type is vitally {{important}} based on the engine {{it will be used}} with. Each GM division had its own engine design. Thus, a Chevrolet ignition may not be identical to an Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Buick, or Cadillac engine. Typically, the ignition system compatibility followed the engine size. Most GM engines (of the same size) between 1974 and 1988 used a similar distributor ignition system. The module type is important as well. For non-computer controlled carburetor engines, the 4-pin unit is used since it uses mechanical timing controls (vacuum and centrifugal advance). The 5-pin module is like the 4-pin, with an added knock/detonation <b>sensor</b> <b>input</b> to the module so the ignition could be deliberately retarded and the power output dropped to the spark plug to aid disruption of the knock condition. The 7-pin module is designed for computer timing controls. It incorporates 2 magnetic signals from the pickup sensor, and 3 signals shared with the ECM engine control module), while the remaining 2 pins provide signal and power to the coil. Normally the 7 pin is not used on non-computerized engines since it does not contain mechanical timing controls, but some early designs used a seven-pin distributor module in conjunction with mechanical and vacuum advance in the distributor body, so the seven-pin module would be backward compatible.|$|E

40|$|Mobile robots {{deployed}} in real-world domains frequently {{find it difficult}} to process all <b>sensor</b> <b>inputs,</b> or to operate without human input and domain knowledge. At the same time, complex domains make it difficult to provide robots all relevant domain knowledge in advance, and humans are unlikely to have the time and expertise to provide elaborate and accurate feedback. This paper presents an integrated framework that creates novel opportunities for addressing these learning, adaptation and collaboration challenges associated with human-robot collaboration. The framework consists of hierarchical planning, bootstrap learning and online reinforcement learning algorithms that inform and guide each other. As a result, robots are able to make best use of <b>sensor</b> <b>inputs,</b> soliciting high-level feedback from non-expert humans when such feedback is necessary and available. All algorithms are evaluated in simulation and on wheeled robots in dynamic indoor domains. ...|$|R
