40|$|We {{prove that}} the {{category}} of systems of <b>sesquilinear</b> <b>forms</b> over a given hermitian category {{is equivalent to the}} category of unimodular 1 -hermitian forms over another hermitian category. The <b>sesquilinear</b> <b>forms</b> are not required to be unimodular or defined on a reflexive object (i. e. the standard map from the object to its double dual is not assumed to be bijective), and the forms in the system can be defined with respect to different hermitian structures on the given category. This extends a result obtained by E. Bayer-Fluckiger and D. Moldovan. We use the equivalence to define a Witt ring of <b>sesquilinear</b> <b>forms</b> over a hermitian category, and also to generalize various results (e. g. : Witt's Cancelation Theorem, Springer's Theorem, the weak Hasse principle, finiteness of genus) to systems of <b>sesquilinear</b> <b>forms</b> over hermitian categories.
