5|$|The Apache's first {{operational}} {{tour was}} {{as part of}} 16 Air Assault Brigade in Afghanistan; there were eight Apache AH1s deployed in Afghanistan in February 2007. These were drawn from No. 656 Squadron and No. 664 Squadron of 9 Regiment AAC, based at Dishforth Airfield. Unlike their American counterparts in Afghanistan, the Apache AH1 is deployed with its Longbow Fire Control Radar to enable the pilot to better manage traffic in their airspace. Initially pilots had to often fly for 16–18 {{hours at a time}} due to the low number of Apaches in the theatre; typically each Apache would be stationed in Afghanistan for eight weeks before returning to Britain for roughly eight weeks of maintenance. On 22 May 2006, a UK Apache operating in Afghanistan's Helmand province used a Hellfire missile to destroy an abandoned French vehicle to protect <b>sensitive</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
25|$|While the 741 was {{historically}} used in {{audio and}} other <b>sensitive</b> <b>equipment,</b> such use is now rare {{because of the}} improved noise performance of more modern op-amps.

40|$|This paper mainly {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} ground-borne vibrations due to the planned line 8 of Beijing metro which passes under the National Measurement Laboratory. A lot of vibration <b>sensitive</b> <b>equipments</b> are placed in the laboratory. It is therefore necessary to study the impact of vibrations induced by metro trains on <b>sensitive</b> <b>equipments</b> and important to propound a feasible vibration mitigation measure. Based on the coupled periodic finite element-boundary element (FE-BE) method, a 3 D dynamic track-tunnel-soil interaction model for metro line 8 {{has been used to}} predict vibrations in the free field induced by trains running at variable speeds between 30 km/h and 80 km/h. Four types of track structures commonly used on the Beijing metro network have been considered: (1) high resilience direct fixation fasteners, (2) Vanguard fasteners, (3) a floating slab track and (4) a floating ladder track. For each of these track types, the vibration isolation efficiency has been compared. The results of the numerical study can be used to predict vibrations in nearby buildings and to decide upon effective vibration countermeasures. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|Voltage sag: {{a voltage}} sag {{is a short}} span drop of RMS voltage. Undervoltages are defined as voltage drop greater than two minutes duration. Common reasons of undervoltages and voltage sags are faults (short circuits) on the power system, weather factors, motor starting, {{inclusions}} of customer load and introduction of large loads in the power system. Sags can shut down computers and other <b>sensitive</b> <b>equipments</b> within a moment. Undervoltage conditions can hamper certain types of electrical instruments.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} issues in {{improving}} power quality in distribution network is the mitigation of voltage sags which {{is caused by the}} system faults and adversely affects the <b>sensitive</b> electrical <b>equipments</b> involved in the end user system. End user system includes industrial production processes and large commercial customers. System faults affect <b>sensitive</b> <b>equipments</b> and result in substantial financial losses. Thus need for introduction of custom power devices emerged. One of these devices is Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) which has excellent dynamic capabilities, installed between supply and a critical load feeder; it compensates voltage sags and restores line voltage to its nominal value. The proposed system comprises of a supercapacitor and the power circuit of the DVR. Thus DVR avoids any power disruption to that load. This paper presents supercapacitor based DVR using Proportional Integral (PI) controller. The system is simulated using PSCAD/EMTDC software.

Additionally, Israel said that much of the cargo, including sensitive medical equipment, was found to have been scattered in the ship's holds, and put in piles rather than packed properly for transport, and consequently damaged.

25|$|The station {{provides}} crew {{quarters for}} {{each member of}} the expedition's crew, with two 'sleep stations' in the Zvezda and four more installed in Harmony. The American quarters are private, approximately person-sized soundproof booths. The Russian crew quarters include a small window, but provide less ventilation and sound proofing. A crew member can sleep in a crew quarter in a tethered sleeping bag, listen to music, use a laptop, and store personal items in a large drawer or in nets attached to the module's walls. The module also provides a reading lamp, a shelf and a desktop. Visiting crews have no allocated sleep module, and attach a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall. It is possible to sleep floating freely through the station, but this is generally avoided because of the possibility of bumping into <b>sensitive</b> <b>equipment.</b> It is important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts can wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide has formed around their heads.|$|E

40|$|The {{power quality}} {{becomes one of}} the most {{important}} factor in our present day economy. The concept of true power mainly depends on how correctly the issues like voltage sag and voltage swell are mitigated. Among all the power quality problems, like voltage sag andvoltage swell mentioned are of key importance. This is because of the most widely use of newly invented as well as the outdated <b>sensitive</b> <b>equipments</b> connected to the load. Sensitivity is the main cause of the above power quality problems and it cannot be eliminated completely as it has many other operating properties. So for solve voltage sag and swell problem caused by the <b>sensitive</b> <b>equipments</b> connected to the faulty loads solve by connect some other system like DVR. The occurrence of sag and swell varies with equipment, environment, process operations, desired control schemes etc. by referring IEEE standards, the power quality events will last only for small instants. Thus the real time detection becomes a really tough task and even a small instant variation will cause a series of problems to the process industry. The dynamic voltage restorer is a special type of power device used for providing consistent and reliable supply power to the load devices. Dynamic voltage restorer uses a vector control strategy for mitigating power quality problems by automatically detecting and injecting the voltage components through an injection transformer. Repeated occurrence of sag and swell will cause these equipments to malfunction...|$|R
25|$|On September 12, 1960, Hurricane Donna {{passed over}} Tower 4, causing severe {{structural}} damage, including {{the loss of}} the flying bridge hanging beneath the platform, and one of the communications dishes. After assessment of the damage and initial repairs it was decided to reduce staffing to a skeleton crew and prepare to dismantle the station. The site could not simply be abandoned for fear that the Soviets would board it and remove <b>sensitive</b> <b>equipment</b> and documentation. Dismantling of the tower was therefore protracted. At the approach of another storm in January 1961 evacuation of the station was impeded by the inability of the commander to make contact with any of his three immediate superiors; nonetheless the New Bedford set out for the platform. As the storm built, , which was in the vicinity, was also dispatched with the intent of evacuating the station via helicopter, shore aircraft being unable to take off. Both ships reached the vicinity but could do no more than watch the station disappear from their radar. No survivors were recovered, though divers were sent down on the chance that some might have been trapped in the wreckage. Twenty-eight airmen and civilian contractors perished.|$|E

However, the impact of construction-induced vibrations on <b>sensitive</b> medical <b>equipment</b> is rarely discussed. The vibration limits commonly adopted by the construction industry are mainly with regard to structural safety, which are considerably greater than the tolerable limits for <b>sensitive</b> medical <b>equipment.</b> This case study evaluates the potential effect of ground vibrations induced by piling activities on <b>sensitive</b> medical <b>equipment.</b> The ground-borne vibrations induced by two piling methods are quantified by field measurements.

Commercial voltage regulators normally operate {{on a range of}} voltages, for example 150–240V or 90–280V.

2500|$|The early {{earphones}} {{used with}} wireless-era crystal sets had moving iron drivers that {{worked in a}} way similar to the horn loudspeakers of the period; modern loudspeakers use a moving-coil principle. Each earpiece contained a permanent magnet about which was a coil of wire which formed a second [...] electromagnet. Both magnetic poles were close to a steel diaphram of the speaker. When the audio signal from the radio was passed through the electromagnet's windings, current was caused to flow in the coil which created a varying magnetic field that augmented or diminished that due to the permanent magnet. This varied the force of attraction on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate. The vibrations of the diaphragm push and pull {{on the air in}} front of it, creating sound waves. Standard headphones used in telephone work had a low impedance, often 75 Ω, and required more current than a crystal radio could supply. Therefore, the type used with crystal set radios (and other <b>sensitive</b> <b>equipment)</b> was wound with more turns of finer wire giving it a high impedance of 2000-8000 Ω.|$|E
