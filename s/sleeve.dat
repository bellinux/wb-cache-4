2500|$|The shift (chemise) or smock had full <b>sleeves</b> {{early in}} the period and tight, elbow-length <b>sleeves</b> in the 1740s as the <b>sleeves</b> of the gown narrowed.|$|R
5|$|Early {{pressings}} of the <b>sleeve</b> {{were presented}} in a six-panel gatefold cover, with one side displaying the landscape in the daytime, whilst the other shows the same image at night, playing {{with the idea that}} during the day, the countryside is glorious and the city is dull and grey, whereas at nighttime the countryside is dark and the city is illuminated and alive. To prioritize the design, no text was included on the <b>sleeve</b> apart from a promotional sticker shaped like a red balloon featuring the band's name and album title. Later copies of the album came in a standard plastic case with a protective cardboard <b>sleeve.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>sleeves</b> of a {{traditional}} kurta fall straight to the wrist; they do not narrow, as do many Western-cut <b>sleeves.</b> <b>Sleeves</b> are not cuffed, just hemmed and decorated.|$|R
50|$|The use of knee <b>sleeves</b> in unequipped powerlifting {{has brought}} about much debate as to whether certain {{neoprene}} knee <b>sleeves</b> can actually assist a lifter during the squat. Some lifters purposely wear knee <b>sleeves</b> which are excessively tight and {{have been known to}} use plastic bags and have others to assist them get their knee <b>sleeves</b> on. This led to the IPF mandating that lifters put on their knee <b>sleeves</b> unassisted.|$|R

5|$|Special {{police were}} {{visually}} distinguished by the gradual {{introduction of a}} green uniform with a shoulder patch worn on the right <b>sleeve.</b> Officially referred to as Sword and Lightning,(Mač i munja) {{the design of the}} Croatian special police shoulder <b>sleeve</b> insignia was inspired by the US Army Special Forces insignia.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{release was}} titled Live in Japan and {{featured}} a unique <b>sleeve</b> design, with an overhead stage {{shot of the}} band, a selection of photographs from a gig at the Rainbow Theatre in London, and an insert with lyrics and a hand-written message from each band member. The first pressing came with a 35mm film negative with photos of the band which buyers could develop into their own prints. The <b>sleeve</b> notes claimed that the recording only contained the Tokyo gig, though {{in fact it was}} musically identical to the version released {{in the rest of the}} world. Phil Collen, later to play in Def Leppard, was in the audience for the Rainbow gig as captured on the <b>sleeve.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, as crinolines {{started to}} develop in fashion, <b>sleeves</b> turned to be like large bells which gave the dress a heavier volume. Engageantes, which were usually made of lace, linen, or lawn, with cambric and broderie anglaise, were worn under the <b>sleeves.</b> They were easy to remove, launder and {{restitch}} into position, so to act as false <b>sleeves,</b> which was tacked to the elbow-length <b>sleeves</b> during the time. They commonly appear under the bell-shaped <b>sleeves</b> of day dresses.|$|R
25|$|<b>Sleeves</b> were bell- or trumpet-shaped, {{and caught}} {{up at the}} elbow to show the frilled or lace-trimmed <b>sleeves</b> of the shift (chemise) beneath. <b>Sleeves</b> became {{narrower}} as the period progressed, with a frill at the elbow, and elaborate separate ruffles called engageantes were tacked to the shift <b>sleeves,</b> in a fashion that would persist into the 1770s.|$|R
5000|$|Love egg with <b>sleeves.</b> The {{variety of}} egg <b>sleeves</b> gives more {{opportunities}} for their application and also provides the new sensations. Some sets include <b>sleeves</b> and are sold together with the love eggs. <b>Sleeves</b> are usually made of the soft pleasant to touch materials and may be covered by textural nubs and ribs that bring the extra stimulation.|$|R
5|$|The brigade {{received}} its shoulder <b>sleeve</b> insignia on 19 March 2007 and its distinctive unit insignia on 8 November 2007. The insignia alludes heavily to the unit's {{history with the}} 82d Airborne Division. In 2015 the brigade ceased being a separate unit and {{became part of the}} 82d Airborne Division. As a division unit, its personnel adopted the division's shoulder <b>sleeve</b> insignia and the maroon beret with a brigade-specific flash; however, most of the brigade's personnel are not on jump status and only wear the maroon beret and shoulder <b>sleeve</b> insignia because these are unit uniform items.|$|E

5000|$|Use {{polyethylene}} inner <b>sleeves.</b> Never use PVC <b>sleeves</b> {{as their}} chemical makeup {{is too close}} to vinyl and may cause imprints or fuse to the LP. Replace paper <b>sleeves</b> as paper deteriorates, leaving oil and paper residue.|$|R
5|$|In Uruguay, {{the album}} was {{released}} in 1974 as a single LP (with just the first two sides) on Odeon Records. It used a simplistic <b>sleeve</b> design unlike any other release, with a rising sun on the cover.|$|E

5|$|Live Undead {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a short association between Slayer and artist Albert Cueller. Cueller would design the <b>sleeve</b> image, which depicts the four band members as grinning, partially decayed zombies walking through a graveyard.|$|E
50|$|The earlier cuffed <b>sleeves</b> {{evolved into}} trumpet <b>sleeves,</b> {{tight on the}} upper arm and flared below, with wide, turned back cuffs (often lined with fur) worn over full undersleeves that might match the {{decorated}} forepart. At {{the very end of}} the period, full round <b>sleeves</b> (perhaps derived from Italian fashions) began to replace the flaring trumpet <b>sleeves,</b> which disappeared by the later 1550s.|$|R

5|$|The album art {{was seen}} by many within the {{industry}} as coarse and lacking accepted layout or typographical qualities. HMV would only shelve the <b>sleeve</b> back to front on their racking shelves.|$|E
50|$|Some {{organizations}} have proposed rules banning <b>sleeves</b> among their members; the United States Marine Corps prohibited Marines from getting arm- or leg-sleeve tattoos after April 1, 2007. Those with <b>sleeves</b> already are protected under a grandfather clause. Nevertheless, tattoo <b>sleeves</b> {{have become so}} popular that several clothing companies have produced apparel that simulates the look of tattoo <b>sleeves</b> using transparent mesh fabric printed with tattoo designs.|$|R
5000|$|A {{broadside}} ballad by {{this name}} was registered at the London Stationer's Company in September 1580, by Richard Jones, as [...] "A Newe Northen Dittye of ye Ladye Greene Sleves". Six more ballads followed {{in less than}} a year, one on the same day, 3 September 1580 ("Ye Ladie Greene <b>Sleeves</b> answere to Donkyn hir frende" [...] by Edward White), then on 15 and 18 September (by Henry Carr and again by White), 14 December (Richard Jones again), 13 February 1581 (Wiliam Elderton), and August 1581 (White's third contribution, [...] "Greene <b>Sleeves</b> is worne awaie, Yellow <b>Sleeves</b> Comme to decaie, Blacke <b>Sleeves</b> I holde in despite, But White <b>Sleeves</b> is my delighte"). It then appears in the surviving A Handful of Pleasant Delights (1584) as A New Courtly Sonnet of the Lady Green <b>Sleeves.</b> To the new tune of Green <b>Sleeves.</b>|$|R
40|$|Damage {{effects of}} {{electron}} irradiation with different energy on mechanical properties of polyethylene heat-shrinkable <b>sleeves</b> were studied by irradiating the <b>sleeves</b> with 45 keV, 1 MeV and 2 MeV electrons respectively. The mechanical property degradations of the <b>sleeves</b> {{before and after}} radiations were present. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were {{used to analyze the}} element contents, the morphologies and the molecular structures of the samples to study the damage mechanism of the <b>sleeves.</b> A degradation model for the changes of the mechanical properties of the <b>sleeves</b> in electron radiation environment was proposed. It is shown that the increase of irradiation degradation of the polyethylene causes the sleeves' mechanical properties. For the penetration depth of different energy electrons in polyethylene is different, only a shallow layer the <b>sleeves</b> is affected by 45 keV energy electrons, while 1 MeV and 2 MeV energy electrons are penetrated the <b>sleeves</b> and cause the <b>sleeves</b> great damage. The mechanical properties of the <b>sleeves</b> are decreased by about 30 % to 40 % after 45 keV energy electron irradiation, and decreased by about 100 % after 1 MeV and 2 MeV energy electron irradiation...|$|R
