Debra stayed off television while her new real-life husband Stone Cold Steve Austin recovered from neck surgery. She reappeared in April 2000, acting as a guest ring announcer at Backlash.

5|$|The {{rules that}} can be used in a match vary {{depending}} on the game, but the most commonly used settings across all games are Time and Stock. Time mode uses a point based system in which fighters earn points for knocking out their opponents and lose points for being knocked out or self-destructing (i.e. falling out of the arena by themselves). The player with the highest score at the end of the set time limit wins the match. Survival uses a life-based system in which players are given a set number of lives, known as stock, with each fighter losing a life whenever they are knocked out, becoming eliminated if they run out of lives. The winner is the last fighter standing once all other fighters are eliminated or, if a time-limit is applied to the match, the fighter with the most lives remaining once time runs out. In the event of a tie, such as two or more fighters sharing the highest score/life count at the end of the time limit or remaining fighters losing their last life simultaneously, a <b>Sudden</b> <b>Death</b> <b>match</b> takes place. Here, each of the tied fighters are given a starting damage percentage of 300%, making them easier to launch off the stage, and the last fighter standing wins the match. In some games this process is repeated if the match ends in another tie.|$|E
25|$|Sudden death also {{occurs in}} {{computer}} gaming when both teams {{have the same}} score and a method of breaking a tie is needed. For example, in a Capture the Flag area for Quake III Arena, when neither team has scored, or if no team leads, a <b>sudden</b> <b>death</b> <b>match</b> will decide {{who will be the}} victor. All the teams have to do is get the flag and deliver it to the base one time only in order to win automatically. Sometimes, players share a handicap in order to end the game faster; for example, in a Super Smash Bros. <b>sudden</b> <b>death</b> <b>match,</b> players fight beginning at 300% damage, amplifying how much they are knocked back to the extent that most attacks will KO them in a single blow. In games where the players normally would respawn, like Team Fortress 2, sudden death often means that respawning is disabled and the last team standing wins.|$|E

The Tigers remarkably only lost a single game from that point onwards reaching the Grand Final against Canterbury, only to be denied the trophy in a controversial 24-12 loss. Canterbury player, Terry Lamb, is still remembered by fans for knocking out the legendary Ellery Hanley with a high shot in back play midway through the first half.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the clinical characteristics of family members at risk of <b>sudden</b> <b>death.</b> Background. The significance of <b>sudden</b> <b>death</b> in heritable cardiac disorders with delayed expression is incompletely understood. Additional insights come from a four-decade experience of seven generations of a family of German origin with autosomal dominant (chromosome 1 p 1 - 1 q 1) cardiac conduction and myocardial disease. Methods and Results. A total of 38 family members (20 males; 18 females) were identified with <b>sudden</b> <b>death.</b> Twenty-eight family members (mean age 48 ± 8 years) from earlier generations had no pacemaker at the time of <b>sudden</b> <b>death.</b> In this group, 15 subjects were asymptomatic prior to <b>sudden</b> <b>death.</b> Ten family members with <b>sudden</b> <b>death,</b> from later generations, had chronically implanted pacemakers for high grade atrioventricular block. This group was older (mean age 57 ± 2 years), with decreased functional status (New York Heart Association class II to IV), enlarged left atria, dilated left ventricles with reduced systolic function and documented ventricular fibrillation in three members. Twenty-eight family members with <b>sudden</b> <b>death</b> were descendants of sib lineages 2 or 6; 21 family members with <b>sudden</b> <b>death</b> were offspring of a parent who also suffered <b>sudden</b> <b>death.</b> Conclusion. <b>Sudden</b> <b>death</b> is an important late outcome in heritable (chromosome 1 p 1 - 1 q 1) cardiac conduction and myocardial disease. Pacemaker therapy is important for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, but it does not prevent <b>sudden</b> <b>death.</b> Family members who are beyond the third decade of life with reduced functional capacity, left ventricular dysfunction, pacemakers and who are the offspring of a parent with <b>sudden</b> <b>death</b> appear to be at greatest risk...|$|R
