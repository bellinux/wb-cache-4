25|$|For {{quotient}} rings R/I, {{the change}} of rings is also very clear. An R-module is an R/I-module precisely when it is annihilated by I. The <b>submodule</b> annI(M) = { m in M : im = 0 for all i in I } is a left <b>submodule</b> of the left R-module M, and is the largest <b>submodule</b> of M that is an R/I-module. If M is an injective left R-module, then annI(M) is an injective left R/I-module. Applying this to R=Z, I=nZ and M=Q/Z, one gets the familiar fact that Z/nZ is injective as a module over itself. While {{it is easy to}} convert injective R-modules into injective R/I-modules, this process does not convert injective R-resolutions into injective R/I-resolutions, and the homology of the resulting complex is one of the early and fundamental areas of study of relative homological algebra.|$|E

25|$|When a {{vector space}} over a field F has a finite {{generating}} set, then one may extract from it a basis {{consisting of a}} finite number n of vectors, and the space is therefore isomorphic to Fn. The corresponding statement with the F generalized to a principal ideal domain R is no longer true, since a basis for a finitely generated module over R might not exist. However such a module is still isomorphic to a quotient of some module Rn with n finite (to see this it suffices to construct the morphism that sends {{the elements of the}} canonical basis of Rn to the generators of the module, and take the quotient by its kernel.) By changing the choice of generating set, one can in fact describe the module as the quotient of some Rn by a particularly simple <b>submodule,</b> and this is the structure theorem.|$|E
