50|$|Anglia saloons were {{provided}} with various levels of trim. The base model was the Standard, and this sported no chromework, painted rear light surrounds, steel slatted grille and limited interior trim. The deluxe had a chrome <b>side</b> <b>strip,</b> chrome rear lights, glovebox lid, sun visor and full width chrome radiator grille. The {{top of the range}} was the Super, which had twin chrome side strips, contrasting coloured roof and side flash, plusher interior trim, together with the 1198 cc engine and a gearbox with synchromesh on first gear.|$|E
50|$|In Japan {{only the}} 1.2- and 1.4-litre models were {{originally}} available, as the A10 and A20. These {{were replaced by}} the 1.3 and the 1.6 in April 1978 (A30 and A40), along with {{minor changes to the}} exterior and interior, including a new grille and dashboard. A protective <b>side</b> <b>strip</b> was also added. The new engines were the 4K-U and the 2T-U, while the van received the 4K-J (while retaining the T-J) - these engines fulfilled the commercial vehicle emissions specifications. In July an automatic version of the 1.6 appeared.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the same}} time as the 420 was released, Jaguar added a chrome <b>side</b> <b>strip</b> and side {{repeater}} indicator to the Mark X and a centre bar to its grille. Along with alterations to the interior, these changes were used to justify renaming it the 420G ("G" [...] for Grand). The Motor magazine of October 1966 referred to the 420G as [...] "still one of the best looking large cars in the world today" [...] and commented on the similarity of its new radiator grille to that of the 420. Given the similarity between both the names and frontal styling of the 420 and 420G, the casual observer might be forgiven for mistaking one for the other.|$|E

40|$|The {{extraction}} system of a cyclotron guides an ion beam from a spiral acceleration orbit, through an extraction trajectory, into a high energy transport line. The two methods {{commonly used to}} direct an ion into the extraction path are deflection, by the electric field of an electrostatic deflector, and ion stripping, by a thin carbon foil. Compared to the electrostatic deflector system, the stripping extraction provides a fast and easy change of the extracted ion energy and is easier to manufacture operate, and maintain. However, the extraction trajectory and dynamics of an ion beam after stripping are highly dependant on the ion energy and specific charge. Thus, when a multipurpose machine such as the VINCY Cyclotron is concerned, {{it is far from}} easy to deliver a variety of ion beams into the same high energy transport line {{and at the same time}} preserve a reasonable compactness of the {{extraction system}}. The front <b>side</b> <b>stripping</b> extraction system of the VINCY Cyclotron provides high (~ 70 MeV) and mid (~ 30 MeV) energy protons, as well as a number of heavy ions in broad energy ranges. The back <b>side</b> <b>stripping</b> extraction system extracts low energy protons (~ 18 MeV) and enables their simultaneous use with high energy protons at the front side of the machine...|$|R

In August 1961 the doors were modified, now incorporating a triangular vent window and a chromed <b>side</b> <b>strip.</b> In September 1962 the final iteration, the MP5, arrived. It was again somewhat larger than the earlier MP4, with maximum length up to 2970 mm and cargo space increased by 100 mm, {{to a total of}} 1260 mm. As a matter of fact, nearly all body panels were altered in some way, with new marker lights installed, redesigned doors, a blunter and more rounded front, bigger vent openings in front of the doors' leading edge, and finally a solid metal roof rather than the earlier fabric-covered opening. The MP5 also gained more chrome trim, around the headlamps and elsewhere. April 1963 saw the introduction of automatic oil mixing for the two-stroke engine. In August 1969 new safety regulations required certain lighting changes, a driver's side headrest, and seatbelts. The MP5 remained in production until December 1971, and on sale into 1972.|$|E
5000|$|The Orvis (1995-1997) was a Grand Cherokee Limited {{package that}} {{featured}} an exterior color scheme of Moss Green, or in 1997 the (less common) Light Driftwood, with roan red and maize <b>side</b> <b>strip</b> accents (1995). Moss Green paint accents {{on the road}} wheels (matching the moss green body color) and the special [...] "Orvis" [...] brand badging were the only significant exterior visual differences. In performance, the 5.2 V8 engine became standard, but was available with a 4.0 inline 6-cylinder engine. Also, some Orvis editions came with a rear liftglass (which in 1996 became a mainstream option), tow hooks, and the Up-Country suspension group. However, the interior was special. Two-tone green and tan leather seats were complemented with roan red accent piping and Orvis insignia. There was a slight difference between the 1996 and 1997 years' interior compared to each other. The 1996 had a black dash where the 1997 had a tan dash, The Orvis Edition luxury trim package was optional on the Limited version, and when equipped {{with all the other}} options was the most expensive of all the Grand Cherokee versions until 1998 when the 5.9 Limited was introduced. Jeep ended their relationship with Orvis Catalog in 1997, and the Orvis Edition was therefore discontinued.|$|E
5000|$|The Magna Sports was {{available}} in only four colours: Paris White, Calypso Red, Nautilus Blue (deep blue), and Frontier Green (deep green), the latter two colours being new to the TF series. This new model carried all the standard features of the Executive model on which it was based, plus a deck lid spoiler, red <b>side</b> <b>strip,</b> 16-inch alloy wheels (same as the Verada Ei, but polished), and unique interior trims such as a metal-style instrument cluster fascia. Its V6 was standard as on all Magnas, however, only the Sports could be optioned with a manumatic Sports Mode four-speed automatic transmission featuring {{for the first time}} on an Australian-built car, a manual shifting function (via a second transmission gate plane to the right of standard gear positions, with [...] "push-forward" [...] upshifts and [...] "push-back" [...] downshifts). The Sports had improved handling characteristics thanks to the addition of an 18 mm rear swaybar (a rear bar swaybar was not fitted to the standard Magna), 11 percent firmer rear springs, firmer upper control arm and trailing arm bushes, and suspension height lowered by 10 mm. Options included dual airbags and ABS. This specific model represented MMAL's foray into the Australian sporty family passenger car sector, as well as an initial and long overdue departure from the more conservative Japanese product planning. The Sports' production ceased after September 1998.|$|E

40|$|RC beams shear {{strengthened}} {{with either}} fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) U-jackets/U-strips or <b>side</b> <b>strips</b> commonly fail due to debonding of the bonded FRP shear reinforcement. As such debonding {{occurs in a}} brittle manner at relatively small shear crack widths, some of the internal steel stirrups may not have reached yielding. Consequently, the yield strength of internal steel stirrups in such a strengthened RC beam cannot be fully used. In this paper, a computational model for shear interaction between FRP strips and steel stirrups is first presented, in which a general parabolic crack shape function is employed to represent the widening process of a single major shear crack in an RC beam. In addition, appropriate bond-slip relationships are adopted to accurately depict the bond behavior of FRP strips and steel stirrups. Numerical results obtained using this computational model show that a substantial adverse effect of shear interaction generally exists between steel stirrups and FRP strips for RC beams shear strengthened with FRP <b>side</b> <b>strips.</b> For RC beams shear strengthened with FRP U-strips, shear interaction can still have a significant adverse effect when FRP strips with a high axial stiffness are used. Therefore, for accurate evaluation of the shear resistance of RC beams shear strengthened with FRP strips, this adverse effect of shear interaction should be properly considered in design.
