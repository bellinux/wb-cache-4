After discussing the basic elements of spatial thinking, it explores {{the relationship between}} GIScience <b>and</b> <b>spatial</b> thinking by dividing it into two aspects: the role of geographic information systems (GIS) in education on <b>spatial</b> thinking, <b>and</b> the role of spatial thinking in GIScience. Concerning the former, potential roles of GIS in spatial thinking education, particularly in geography and STEM disciplines, are suggested. Concerning the latter, the relationships between the body of knowledge on GIS education and the elements of spatial thinking are examined. Finally, the present situation and future prospects for studies on <b>spatial</b> thinking <b>and</b> GIScience in Japan are briefly discussed...|$|R

Geographers and cognitive psychologists have argued that this model is insufficient to capture the complexity of spatial cognition related to navigation. They have suggested that new theories are needed to understand the integration of various kinds of <b>spatial</b> knowledge <b>and</b> their relationship with spatial activities, such as route planning, route choosing and so on. In virtual environments, users can scale {{up and down the}} virtual space to obtain different <b>spatial</b> knowledge <b>and</b> interaction domains. Such flexibility offers an opportunity to deepen our understanding of the relationship between <b>spatial</b> knowledge <b>and</b> <b>spatial</b> action. This paper reports a study on how scaling in virtual environments can improve the integration of <b>spatial</b> knowledge <b>and</b> <b>spatial</b> action. This paper first proposes a multiscale progressive model that couples <b>spatial</b> knowledge <b>and</b> movement across scale in navigation in virtual environments. Then, the paper introduces the design of multiscale environments to support the coupling. Results of an experimental study show the benefits of the coupled <b>spatial</b> knowledge <b>and</b> movement for navigation involving subtasks at different scale levels. In addition to helping better understand the relationship between <b>spatial</b> knowledge <b>and</b> <b>spatial</b> action, this research also gives some insight into designs to support navigation in virtual environments as well as designs to support cross-scale spatial knowledge access in the real world...|$|R
