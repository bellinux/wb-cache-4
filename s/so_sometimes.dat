5|$|Cofresí {{received}} a council of war trial, with {{no possibility of}} a civil trial. The only right granted the pirates was to choose their lawyers; the arguments the attorneys could make were limited, and their role was a formality. José Madrazo was again the prosecutor. The case was hurried—an oddity, since other cases as serious (or more <b>so)</b> <b>sometimes</b> took months or years. Cofresí was reportedly tried as an insurgent corsair (and listed as such in a subsequent explanatory action in Spain), in accordance with measures enacted by governor Miguel de la Torre the year before. It is thought {{that the reason for}} the irregularities was that the Spanish government was under international scrutiny, with several neutral countries filing complaints about pirate and privateer attacks in Puerto Rican waters; there was additional pressure due to the start of David Porter's court-martial in the United States for invading the municipality of Fajardo. The ministry rushed the Cofresí trial, denying him and his crew defense witnesses or testimony (required by trial protocol). The trial was based on the pirates' confessions, with their legitimacy or circumstances not established.|$|E
25|$|All taxis are {{imported}} new, {{there is}} a type approval process for approving the models of cars {{to be used as}} taxis (which means unapproved models cannot be used as taxis). However, used parts of Japan are frequently used. <b>So</b> <b>sometimes</b> there are Japanese stickers on the taxis doors.|$|E
25|$|Difficulties {{along the}} border {{continued}} during World War I while the United States was at war in Europe. Mexican bandits often raided American ranches to secure supplies, cattle, and horses, and in doing <b>so</b> <b>sometimes</b> killed the ranchers. U.S. troops stationed {{along the border}} shot raiders as they pursued them into Mexico. The biggest clash came in August 1918, when more than 800 American troops fought some 600 Mexicans near Nogales, Arizona.|$|E

25|$|The cellar in {{the tower}} base was used in {{different}} ways. In some instances it {{was used as a}} warehouse or magazine, <b>so</b> <b>sometimes</b> piles of round stones were kept here for use as projectiles during a siege. In a few cases, it was used as a cistern, but often the room remained unused. The blanket assumption in older literature and often also in tourism that the cellar space was used as the dungeon is thus misleading.|$|E
25|$|Immune {{reactions}} during pregnancy, both {{maternal and}} of the developing child, may produce neurodevelopmental disorders. One typical immune reaction in infants and children is PANDAS, or Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infection. Another disorder is Sydenham's chorea, which results in more abnormal movements {{of the body and}} fewer psychological sequellae. Both are immune reactions against brain tissue that follow infection by Streptococcus bacteria. Susceptibility to these immune diseases may be genetically determined, <b>so</b> <b>sometimes</b> several family members may suffer from one or both of them following an epidemic of Strep infection.|$|E
25|$|The Ueschinen Hut is {{situated}} in the Ueschinen Valley, at a height of 1,890metres, and about two to three hours' {{walk away from the}} centre. It is usually open from May to October. During the summer it is used mainly as a base for climbing and hiking activities, but it may be used by groups at any time if weather allows. The hut is actually half of a cowshed, <b>so</b> <b>sometimes</b> it is a bit noisy at night. It can sleep up to 30 people and has a fully equipped kitchen with wood stove, a general living and eating room and a special toilet– there is no electricity and no shower.|$|E

25|$|In {{association}} football, {{the award}} typically {{goes to a}} player on the winning side. Players who score a hat-trick, or goalkeepers who keep a clean sheet under resounding pressure often get the award. Hat-trick scorers usually receive the match ball {{whether or not they}} are officially named man of the match. However, not all tournaments/leagues have an official man of the match award, <b>so</b> <b>sometimes</b> accolades are given by websites/newspapers instead. In the Premier League, for example, a player will receive a small black and gold trophy, 20 centimeters in height, 6.4 centimeters in width and 6.4 centimeters in depth, for their man of the match performance.|$|E
25|$|Lighting {{designers}} sometimes select filters {{by color}} temperature, commonly to match light that is theoretically white. Since fixtures using discharge type lamps produce a {{light of a}} considerably higher color temperature than do tungsten lamps, using the two in conjunction could potentially produce a stark contrast, <b>so</b> <b>sometimes</b> fixtures with HID lamps, commonly producing light of 6000–7000K, are fitted with 3200K filters to emulate tungsten light. Fixtures with color mixing features or with multiple colors, (if including 3200K) are also capable of producing tungsten-like light. Color temperature {{may also be a}} factor when selecting lamps, since each is likely to have a different color temperature.|$|E
25|$|The Child of Thorns, Chise's {{master and}} fiancé, once apprenticed to Master Lindenbaum. A being with both fae and human elements, his origins are a mystery. Known as the Thorn Sorcerer, the other faeries {{see him as}} an abomination, {{something}} he does not mind. Besides using glamour to hide his appearance, he can control and also turn himself into shadows, and when angry enough, he takes on a more monstrous form. He can even change his head to a human’s using magic. Despite claiming to lack human emotions, after some time caring for Chise he has slowly developed a true fondness for her. However, his innate lack of understanding certain human emotions makes Lindenbaum call him a child. He dislikes children. He says {{they do not have}} magic powers, but they are talented in being able to see the true nature of things, <b>so</b> <b>sometimes</b> he is found out. He is called “Pilum Murialis” by the wizards.|$|E

I hold pride that we remain one of the great wonders of the world ... <b>so</b> <b>sometimes</b> you got to remind people a little bit." ...|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Bengal" [...] {{incorporates}} {{to delineate}} the ethno-linguistic region of Bengal which including {{but not limited}} is all districts within the People's Republic of Bangladesh, as well as West Bengal, India. During the first partition of Bengal in the early 20th century a new province, Eastern Bengal was created as a Lieutenant-Governorship along with Assam. In 1911, East Bengal (now Bangladesh) was reunited with Bengal, and the new provinces in the east became: Assam, Bengal Province. The Nawab thus gained rule over Orissa, which were earlier part of Bengal. [...] <b>So</b> <b>sometimes</b> [...] That is why the Nawabs of Bengal were also mentioned as [...] "Nawab of Bengal" [...] - where Nazim (or, Subahdar) means the provincial governor - as they ruled over three subahs while the Nawabs of Murshidabad were the local ruler {{of the city of}} Murshidabad. The majority of modern Bengal is inhabited by Bengali people who speak the Bengali language.|$|E

500|$|In 1882, {{seeking more}} {{professional}} orchestral experience, Elgar {{was employed to}} play violin in Birmingham with William Stockley's Orchestra, for whom he would play every concert {{for the next seven}} years and where he later claimed he [...] "learned all the music I know". On 13 December 1883 he took part with Stockley in a performance at Birmingham Town Hall of one of his first works for full orchestra, the Sérénade mauresque – the first time one of his compositions had been performed by a professional orchestra. Stockley had invited him to conduct the piece but later recalled [...] "he declined, and, further, insisted upon playing in his place in the orchestra. The consequence was that he had to appear, fiddle in hand, to acknowledge the genuine and hearty applause of the audience." [...] Elgar often went to London in an attempt to get his works published, but this period in his life found him frequently despondent and low on money. He wrote to a friend in April 1884, [...] "My prospects are about as hopeless as ever ... I am not wanting in energy I think, <b>so</b> <b>sometimes</b> I conclude that 'tis want of ability. ... I have no money– not a cent." ...|$|E

2500|$|Electrotyping {{was used}} for general purpose type {{manufacture}} in the nineteenth century, but was a somewhat disreputable process, leading to some typefounders disdaining it (or at least claiming to). This was because it {{could just as easily}} be used to pirate another company’s type as an original design. (It was also used to revive older typefaces in cases where original punches had not survived but matrices or type had, and <b>so</b> <b>sometimes</b> for licensed copying of typefaces in order to send matrices to other countries.) ...|$|E

It's sort of like I'm taken over or someone's trying to contact me; I really believe very much that I'm in some ways channeling this thing. Because when I write a song it's always done very quickly, completed in 20minutes or maybe half an hour. I never labour anything, or very rarely. The only labouring I've ever done in songwriting might be when I've completed a work, a song, and {{there might be a}} couple of lyrics I don't like, <b>so</b> <b>sometimes</b> I might sit with those and really put some brain power in how to fix up the lines. But for the most part it comes to me, it comes in and I can hear the whole thing finished with harmonies and everything." [...] Graeham Goble (2001) ...|$|E
2500|$|In the United Kingdom for example, a {{relatively}} comprehensive, [...] "free {{at the point}} of delivery" [...] health care system exists, funded by the state. Hospital care is thus relatively easily available to all legal residents, although free emergency care is available to anyone, regardless of nationality or status. As hospitals prioritise their limited resources, there is a tendency for 'waiting lists' for non-crucial treatment in countries with such systems, as opposed to letting higher-payers get treated first, <b>so</b> <b>sometimes</b> those who can afford it take out private health care to get treatment more quickly. On the other hand, some countries, including the USA, have in the twentieth century introduced a private-based, for-profit-approach to providing hospital care, with few state-money supported 'charity' hospitals remaining today. Where for-profit hospitals in such countries admit uninsured patients in emergency situations (such as during and after Hurricane Katrina in the USA), they incur direct financial losses, ensuring that there is a clear disincentive to admit such patients. In the United States, laws exist to ensure patients receive care in life-threatening emergency situations regardless of the patient's ability to pay.|$|E
