According to media reports, 1,000 people per hour entered the Casa Rosada in groups of 100 to 150. Cristina Kirchner, dressed in mourning, <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coffin. People brought candles, flags and flowers, some of which Cristina accepted personally.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{electricity}} in the station ceased in 1919, ushered in by the completion of an extension to generating equipment at Newburn Steelworks. The building was retained and continued {{to be used to}} supply power to the tram route by housing a sub-station, which used rotary converters. The station also provided a service for local residents who wanted their wireless accumulators recharged. The station continued to operate in this way until 1946, when the tram route was closed. The station's chimney was demolished in 1949, along with remaining structures of the Tyne Iron Works, which had <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> power station throughout its operation.|$|E

25|$|William Wells Brown, {{who escaped}} to freedom, {{reported}} that on one plantation, slave men {{were required to}} pick 80 pounds per day of cotton, while women were required to pick 70 pounds; if any slave failed {{in his or her}} quota, they were subject to whip lashes for each pound they were short. The whipping post <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cotton scales. A New York man who attended a slave auction in the mid-19th century reported that at least three-quarters of the male slaves he saw at sale had scars on their backs from whipping. By contrast, small slave-owning families had closer relationships between the owners and slaves; this sometimes resulted in a more humane environment but was not a given.|$|E

25|$|The beach front {{promenade}} {{remains a}} popular draw for visitors and tourists with its Victorian Italian Garden that displays many unusual {{palm trees and}} exotic plants. The surviving element of the original Victorian pier is a summer staging point for the various pleasure steamers, that ply their trade {{from time to time}} in the Bristol Channel and the pier is used as a popular winter sea fishing venue. There is also the historic Penarth Yacht Club, built in 1883, <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new RNLI lifeboat station and its associated shop, together with a wide range of popular cafes and restaurants available on the seafront. The seafront remains uncommercialised with none of the amusement arcades that can be found at other traditional Victorian holiday resort frontages. The town's swimming pool and baths built in the late 19th century was closed in the 1980s and, after a short reincarnation as a bar and bistro, has recently been tastefully converted into luxury flats while retaining its Victorian exterior.|$|E

[...] Number 1, also called St John's Lodge, was the largest, and was built for Edward Tarner (a merchant) and his wife Laetitia, whose maiden name was Tilbury. It passed through the family until 1933, when Laetitia Tilbury Tarner, a descendant, left it to Brighton Corporation for charitable purposes. It was converted into Tarner Home, a nursing and care institute for poor people, and later became a hostel.|$|E

500|$|The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit {{reversed}} {{the decision of}} the District Court, holding that the cocaine should have been suppressed and that Drayton and Brown's convictions should be reversed. The Eleventh Circuit stated that its holding was compelled by circuit precedent, which held that bus passengers do not feel free to decline police officers' requests to search without [...] "some positive indication that consent could have been refused". Applying circuit precedent to the facts of the case, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that Drayton and Brown were not aware that they could have refused the search, and the evidence discovered through the pat down must be excluded at trial. The Eleventh Circuit emphasized that officers gave no reassurances that passengers were free to leave, and the fact that an officer <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exit [...] "might make a reasonable person feel less free to leave the bus". On January 4, 2002, the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari to review {{the decision of the}} Eleventh Circuit.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "High Classical" [...] period {{lasted only}} a few decades from about 450 to 400, but has had a momentous {{influence}} on art, and retains a special prestige, despite a very restricted number of original survivals. The best known works are the Parthenon Marbles, traditionally (since Plutarch) executed by {{a team led by}} the most famous ancient Greek sculptor Phidias, active from about 465–425, who was in his own day more famous for his colossal chryselephantine Statue of Zeus at Olympia (c. 432), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, his Athena Parthenos (438), the cult image of the Parthenon, and Athena Promachos, a colossal bronze figure that <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Parthenon; all of these are lost but are known from many representations.

When the staff noticed Widener's work, they re-checked Wah's negative to see if it was of the same moment as Widener's. On March 20, 2013, in an interview by the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (HKPPA), Wah told the story and added further detail. He told HKPPA that on the night of June 3, 1989, he was beaten by students while taking photos and was bleeding. A [...] "foreign" [...] photographer accompanying him suddenly said, [...] "I am not gonna die for your country," [...] and left. Wah returned to the hotel.

2500|$|During {{the course}} of the Balkan Wars Bulgaria had {{captured}} {{a relatively small number of}} prisoners, therefore their internment was limited to cities. Bulgaria entered the First World War, having no previous experience of running prisoner of war camps. Arrangements were improvised on the spot, causing major logistical issues. A document titled [...] "Regulations for Prisoners of War" [...] was issued on 9 October 1915, it officially endorsed the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. Nevertheless many regulations were characterized by their ambiguity, thus granting the camp commanders disproportionate power in the decision making process. While the Plovdiv camp <b>stood</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Arda river and the weather was mild, the Haskovo lacked a supply of clean water. The reports issued by the camp commanders were filled incorrectly and rarely described humanitarian conditions. Furthermore inspections to the camps were scarce and irregular. Regulations were overhauled in 1918 when the Bulgarian government acknowledged the existence of disparities between the camps. Yet the lack of an adequate enforcement mechanism and the hardships faced by Bulgaria during that time frame prevented them from being implemented.|$|E
