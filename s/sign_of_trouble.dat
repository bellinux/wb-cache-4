25|$|At the trial, some 100 {{reporters were}} {{seated at the}} press tables. Hundreds more {{gathered}} on the courthouse lawn. National Guard members in plain clothes mingled in the crowd, looking for any <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble.</b> The Sheriff's department brought the defendants to Court in a patrol wagon guarded by two carloads of deputies armed with automatic shotguns.|$|E
25|$|A train {{passed through}} Getå at 6:26 p.m. without any problems. The first <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> {{came when the}} station guard on duty at Getå Halt heard the {{telephone}} wires vibrating between 6:33 and 6:40. At around 6:50 p.m., a milk cart went by the site; no collapse was noticed. Between 6:52 and 6:55 the clay stratum under the embankment gave way and collapsed. At approximately 6:55, the telegraph network that ran along the railway line came down.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> aboard Estonia {{was when}} a {{metallic}} bang was heard, {{caused by a}} heavy wave hitting the bow doors around 01:00, when the ship was {{on the outskirts of}} the Turku archipelago, but an inspection—limited to checking the indicator lights for the ramp and visor—showed no problems. Over the next 10 minutes, similar noises were reported by passengers and other crew. At about 01:15, the visor in which the ship's bow door opened separated, and the ship immediately took on a heavy starboard list (initial 30 to 40 degrees, but by 01:30, the ship had rolled 90 degrees) as water flooded into the vehicle deck. Estonia was turned to port and slowed before her four engines cut out completely.|$|E

25|$|The {{first two}} years of the García {{government}} gave new hope to the people of Peru, with rising employment, production, and wages suggesting a clear turn for the better after so many years of increasing difficulties. It was hence doubly tragic to see the whole process unravel so quickly, once things started going wrong again. The first <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> came, as it often had, from the balance of payments. The economic boom naturally raised imports swiftly, by 76 percent between 1985 and 1987. But the real exchange rate was allowed to fall by 10 percent in 1986 and by a further 9 percent in 1987. The boom pulled potential export supply into the domestic market, and the fall in the real exchange rate reduced incentives to earn foreign exchange. Exports fell slightly in 1985 and remained below that level through 1987. The external current account went from a surplus of US$127 million in 1985 to deficits of nearly US$1.1 billion in 1986 and nearly US$1.5 billion in 1987.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, then-Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers {{told the}} Dutch Parliament that {{his office was}} running a secret {{organisation}} {{that had been set}} up inside the Dutch defence ministry in the 1950s, but denied it was supervised directly by NATO or other foreign bodies. He went to inform that successive prime ministers and defence chiefs had always preferred not to inform other Cabinet members or Parliament about the secret organization. It was modeled on the nation's World War II experiences of having to evacuate the royal family and transfer government to a government-in-exile, originally aiming to provide an underground intelligence network to a government-in-exile {{in the event of a}} foreign invasion, although it included elements of guerilla warfare. Former Dutch Defence Minister Henk Vredeling confirmed the group had set up arms caches around the Netherlands for sabotage purposes. Members of the cell are believed to have taken part in a training exercise in Sicily. The operating bureaus of the organisation would also move to safety in England or the USA at the first <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble.</b>|$|E
500|$|As {{with many}} other films in the series, Maneater was heavily panned by critics. Felix Gonzalez, Jr. of DVDReview.com {{referred}} to the film as [...] "another Z-grade extravaganza of gore and mayhem" [...] and {{felt that it was}} typical of most Sci Fi original movies in that it contained [...] "horrendous writing and nonsensical characters." [...] He considered Busey's being the headliner was the first <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble,</b> stating that [...] "with his ill-fitting suit and incomprehensible facial expressions, (Busey) is actually more frightening than the tiger." [...] Matt Paprocki from Blogcritics felt the original novel was superior to its film adaptation, and felt the movie was [...] "an appallingly bad creature feature that barely qualifies as such" [...] with multiple plot holes, unexplored subplots, and stereotypical characters plagued by bad acting.|$|E

500|$|Once all {{outstanding}} CSM-012 hardware {{problems were}} fixed, the reassembled spacecraft finally completed a successful altitude chamber test with Schirra's backup crew on December 30. According {{to the final}} report of the accident investigation board, [...] "At the post-test debriefing the backup flight crew expressed their satisfaction with the condition and performance of the spacecraft." [...] This would appear to contradict the account given in Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 by Jeffrey Kluger and astronaut James Lovell, that [...] "When the trio {{climbed out of the}} ship, … Schirra {{made it clear that he}} was not pleased with what he had seen," [...] and that he later warned Grissom and Shea that [...] "there's nothing wrong with this ship that I can point to, but it just makes me uncomfortable. Something about it just doesn't ring right," [...] and that Grissom should get out at the first <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1880, the Liberals had won {{the general}} {{election}} {{on a platform of}} imperial retrenchment, and Gladstone had put his principles into practice by withdrawing from the Transvaal and Afghanistan in 1881. There was an imperialist [...] "ultra" [...] faction in the War Office led by Wolseley that felt that the Liberal government were too inclined to withdraw from various places all over the globe at the first <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble,</b> and who were determined to sabotage the withdrawal from the Sudan. Gordon and Wolseley were good friends (Wolseley {{was one of the people}} Gordon prayed for every night), and after a meeting with Wolseley at the War Office to discuss the crisis in the Sudan, Gordon left convinced that he had to go to the Sudan to [...] "carry out the work of God".|$|E
2500|$|... "Desiree's Baby" [...] {{was first}} {{published}} in an 1893 issue of Vogue magazine, alongside another of Kate Chopin's short stories, [...] "A Visit to Avoyelles", under the heading [...] "Character Studies: The Father of Desiree's Baby - The Lover of Mentine." [...] "A Visit to Avoyelles" [...] typifies the local color writing that Chopin was known for, and is one of her stories that shows a couple in a completely fulfilled marriage. While Doudouce is hoping otherwise, he sees ample evidence that Mentine and Jules' marriage is a happy and fulfilling one, despite the poverty-stricken circumstances that they live in. In contrast, in [...] "Desiree's Baby", which is much more controversial, due to the topic of miscegenation, portrays a marriage in trouble. The other contrasts to [...] "A Visit to Avoyelles" [...] are very clear, although some are more subtle than others. Unlike Mentine and Jules, Armand and Desiree are rich and own slaves and a plantation. Mentine and Jules' marriage has weathered many hard times, while Armand and Desiree's falls apart at the first <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble.</b> Kate Chopin was very talented at showing various sides of marriages and local people and their lives, making her writing very broad and sweeping in topic, even as she had many common themes in her work.|$|E

2500|$|The {{emergency}} brake was originally intended for one particular emergency {{and that was}} [...] "no other way to stop", {{as was the case}} when the footbrake suddenly failed. Drivers had to respond when brakes failed, so they were expected to learn how to stop a speeding vehicle using the {{emergency brake}} alone. Safety regulations became almost universal by 1980, so modern brake systems are very reliable, using dual-circuit hydraulics and more recently low-brake-fluid sensors. As modern brakes no longer cause emergencies (a brake warning light comes on after the first <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble),</b> it is no longer necessary for the average driver to learn to use this brake for emergencies. Some drivers benefiting from the [...] "park" [...] function on their automatic transmissions do not use this brake at all (daily use of the park brake is recommended). After a lack of recent braking emergencies, automakers stopped using the term and started referring it by its other use, the [...] "parking brake", even though the ability to function at a high speed was still there. On an increasing number of modern vehicles, the parking brake can only be engaged when the vehicle is at a stop, and they no longer have an emergency brake.|$|E

60|$|And {{when the}} work falls in a woman's lap, of its own accord, and the needle involuntarily ceases to fly, it is a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble,</b> quite as {{trustworthy}} as the throb of the heart itself.

6000|$|Later on still--just as Dicky {{had been}} told--apropos of another youngster who had [...] "made {{a fool of}} himself," [...] as the saying is--that matrimony would not only ruin his further chances of advancement, but would lose him his present appointment--came {{the news that the}} baby, his own little, little son, had died, and, behind this, forty lines of an angry woman's scrawl, saying that death might have been averted if certain things, all costing money, had been done, or if the mother and the baby had been with Dicky.

60|$|No {{one really}} knows who his best friends are until he gets in trouble.

But let trouble come, and all too often these seeming friends disappear as if by magic, until only a few, sometimes a very few, are left. These are the real friends, the true friends, and they are worth more than all the others put together. Remember that if you are a true friend to any one, you will stand by him and help him, no matter what happens. Sometimes it is almost worth while getting into trouble just to find out who your real friends are.|$|E
