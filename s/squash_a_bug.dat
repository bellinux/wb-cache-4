40|$|Stereopsis is {{the rich}} {{impression}} of three-dimensionality, based on binocular disparity&# 8212;the {{differences between the}} two retinal images of the same world. However, a substantial proportion of the population is stereo-deficient, and relies mostly on monocular cues to judge the relative depth or distance of objects in the environment. Here we trained adults who were stereo blind or stereo-deficient owing to strabismus and/or amblyopia in a natural visuomotor task&# 8212;a ‘bug squashing’ game&# 8212;in a virtual reality environment. The subjects' task was to <b>squash</b> <b>a</b> virtual dichoptic <b>bug</b> on <b>a</b> slanted surface, by hitting it with a physical cylinder they held in their hand. The perceived surface slant was determined by monocular texture and stereoscopic cues, with these cues being either consistent or in conflict, allowing us to track the relative weighting of monocular versus stereoscopic cues as training in the task progressed. Following training most participants showed greater reliance on stereoscopic cues, reduced suppression and improved stereoacuity. Importantly, the training-induced changes in relative stereo weights were significant predictors of the improvements in stereoacuity. We conclude that some adults deprived of normal binocular vision and insensitive to the disparity information can, with appropriate experience, recover access to more reliable stereoscopic information. clos...|$|R
5000|$|Temple Brooks Gault - Serial killer. Nephew of {{a general}} officer and Medal of Honor winner. Described by Kay as having many shades of hair. With sharp {{features}} and eyes as pale blue as a malamute's (This is an error on the author's part as malamutes do not have blue eyes, only varying shades of brown. A Siberian Husky can have blue eyes, but not malamutes). He enjoyed military clothing or designs suggestive of it, such as the boots and the long black leather coat he was seen wearing in New York. His first encounter with {{the criminal justice system}} had been less than five {{years ago when he was}} drinking White Russians in a bar in Abingdon, Virginia. An intoxicated truck driver, who did not like effeminate males, began to harass Gault, who had a black belt in karate. Without a word, Gault smiled his strange smile. He got up, spun around and kicked the man in the head. Half a dozen off-duty state troopers happened to be at a nearby table, which was perhaps the only reason Gault was caught and charged with manslaughter. He also held a great animosity towards his twin sister Rachael Jayne Gault. According to his father, [...] "from day one Temple wanted to <b>squash</b> her like <b>a</b> <b>bug.</b> He was cruel." [...] He was killed by snipers after having an artery slashed by Kay using the dissecting knife he'd used to hold Lucy hostage. He fell on the railway track after being shot and was crushed by an oncoming train.|$|R

In structured IR, fields from <b>a</b> <b>bug</b> report and code constructs, such as class or method names, are separately modeled as distinct documents. Consequently, bug reports and source files are not counted as single documents. Instead, BLUiR breaks bug reports into summary and description, while source files are split into class names, method names, variable names, and comments. Each part of <b>a</b> <b>bug</b> report is compared to each part from the source file. The similarity of <b>a</b> <b>bug</b> report and <b>a</b> source file is given by the sum of the calculated similarities.|$|R
