40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the religious {{impact of the}} Black Death, the plague that devastated Europe {{during the middle of}} the fourteenth century. It explores the effect of the Black Death on the Catholic Church and the religious movements that emerged in response to it. The conclusions drawn here are based on the research of both primary and secondary sources. The Church played a significant role during the Middle Ages because religion was an important aspect of daily life for European Christians. When the Black Death struck Europe in 1347, the Church struggled to cope with the plague’s damaging consequences and its reputation suffered as a result. This thesis concludes that the Black Death contributed to the decline in the confidence and faith of the Christian laity towards the institution of the Church and its leadership. The scope of this paper focuses on the plague’s impact on the clergy, the rise of the flagellant movement, and the widespread Jewish persecutions that ensued in the wake of the plague. The Black Death was a significant event in the history of Western society with profound cultural and demographic consequences, and its impact on the Church and religion in medieval <b>society</b> <b>justifies</b> the study of this topic...|$|E
40|$|Yannis Smarnakis Social Hierarchy in Pletho and its Models The {{subject of}} this paper are the models of social {{organization}} proposed by G. Gemistos-Plethon to the despot of Peloponnese Theodore II Palaeologus and to the emperor Manuel II Palaeologus. The main sources for the investigation are two texts, written by Plethon, the first one between   1407 - 1415 and the second in 1418. The older text that {{was sent to the}} despot Theodore, depends on the platonic dialogues and proposes a similar model of three classes for the peloponnesian society. An interesting ideological shift was detected in the second text of 1418. Here the author proposes the division of the peloponnesian people into three parts, the soldiers, the priests and the peasants. The new model is identical to the ideological system of the three classes or functions in medieval France. I think that the main source of inspiration for Plethon was the specific ternary model that was grounded, in medieval France, on the neoplatonic tradition. Plethon transfers this ideological system to the social reality of his contemporary Peloponnese that was marked by the struggle of the powerful local aristocracy against the institution of monarchy. The ternary model gives a stable form to the peloponnesian <b>society,</b> <b>justifies</b> the role of the military aristocracy as the state against the Turks and legitimatizes the place of the monarch as the sovereign of the soldiers {{at the top of the}} social pyramid.  </p...|$|E

40|$|Research and research-related {{activities}} have {{an extremely important}} role to play in socio-economic development. Indeed, the level of research and the intellectual activities of a society mirror its level of development and, similarly, these reflect its ability and capacity to fashion and mould its own path of development. This statement states the obvious; but the obviousness of this reality does not imply the full and ready acceptance of the usefulness of research by society. The ambiguity with which research is regarded is evidenced by the predicament faced in particular by the social sciences. It is only recently that the social sciences have begun to be seriously accorded due legitimacy, and their direct impact on development recognised by governments in the greater part of Africa. Indeed, in the majority of cases, the social sciences are at best usually regarded as either a luxury and at the worst as useless irritants which have no direct material value. Social science faculties are frequently viewed as either producing "talking shops" or as outfits of armchair theoreticians totally divorced from the real world. In a sense, this criticism is not without justification. The "know-it-all" attitude of a few social scientists has not endeared the discipline to society either, particularly the policymakers hard pressed to solve practical, life-and-death questions confronting society. Many social scientists have projected their role as one of either unsympathetically criticizing policymakers or presenting their views in the most esoteric and highly theoretical fashion. Both these traits have tended to breed hostility towards, or insulation from, scholars by those involved with policy. The end result has been a dismissive attitude towards social scientists. The position of the "hard" (or natural and physical) sciences is slightly different. Their role has generally been accepted, even though sometimes and in a significant number of cases only somewhat vaguely and mythically. Generally, though they have been promoted by governments, in terms of allocation of finance, equipment and supplies, they have fared only somewhat relatively to the social sciences. 1 Admittedly, this is partly because the "hard" sciences lend themselves more easily to more obvious, immediate practical utility compared to the social sciences, principally because their results are of immediate practical implications and implementation. "Hard" sciences seem to provide the magic wand for many problems concerning the daily lives and struggles of human society. They have visible utility in medicine, agriculture, industry, defence and a myriad of other fields. The social sciences, on the other hand, may not appear to be of immediate practical utility. And where the social sciences are consistently imbued with the notion of pursuit of knowledge for knowledge's sake, they are bound to be esoteric. Likewise, the pursuit of knowledge itself, if not closely related to the concerns and problems of <b>society,</b> <b>justifies</b> the criticism levelled against the social sciences. Social sciences must therefore be relevant, responsive to and deeply rooted in society. Being relevant and responsive do not imply supporting the status quo', it means seriously analyzing and shedding light on issues affecting society. This does not imply neutrality either; a social scientist interprets society objectively but from an ideological perspective which is reflective of his orientation and position in the socio-economic system. The ideological perspective is thus the crystallization of normative values on which justice and injustice are based. The real issue, however, is not which of the two branches of sciences is more important. For, in reality, the impact of the social sciences is equally important since, by his very nature, man is a social animal. Social sciences play a complementary role to the natural and physical sciences and vice versa. The social sciences have to do with man's struggle for the control and management of nature and the environment as much as the natural sciences do. Within the realm of the social sciences is included not only the study of man's social, political and economic behaviour, but also his ethos, aspirations, ideas and thoughts in the context of society. In other words, the social sciences are concerned with the very core, and are an embodiment, of the existence of man. And their function is to scientifically attempt to interpret this reality. Stated in another way, the social sciences are the systematic conceptualization and articulation of man's perception of the world as it is, and as it ought to be. Their main objective is not only to explain man and society, but the relationship between man and his environment; and how man has, and can, tame the environment to his best advantage. The sum total of this statement is that social science analysis and practice deal with man's daily struggles with a myriad of forces, and his determination to be in control of his destiny as well as to triumph over nature...|$|E

He advocated using public taxes to assist widows, orphans and the unemployed poor, and criticised the establishment for ignoring those who were fit but impoverished. The findings of the 1844 Royal Commission on Poor Laws (Scotland) lent support to Alison's viewpoint. Alison was very critical of the Scottish upper class for not providing what Alison believed to be adequate relief to the impoverished citizens of the country, while praising the English system, which had a long-established legislative framework to maintain minimum standards of relief for those suffering from poverty. Contrary to England’s governmental standards, Scotland’s system was based around voluntary charity by the wealthier members of <b>society,</b> <b>justified</b> by claiming that legal guarantees of support and relief for the impoverished would remove any motivation for the poor to work out of their situation and would rather create an incentive to stay stagnant as poor in order to receive governmental benefits. Alison counter argued, saying that it was unrelieved poverty that truly lowered the morality of the poor, and not providing any relief not only made the impoverished more prone to contract disease, but also more short-sighted and reckless. There was also no evidence in Alison’s mind that the English system of governmental relief had brought any of the negative consequences that the Scottish had attributed to it, and rather “the English people receive a temporal reward for their more humane and merciful management of the poor, in the comparative exemption of most of their great towns from the curse of contagious fever.” ...|$|R
