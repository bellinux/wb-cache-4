25|$|The {{original}} rails {{were replaced}} in the 1990s, from 60lbs (27.2kg) per yard (0.9m) weight, to 41kg per metre. One in every four sleepers are now steel, with a one in two ratio on curves with a radius under 120m. Some cuttings were also widened in the 1980s and 1990s. Most cuttings are in earth or rock, but some have concrete lining or <b>stone</b> <b>pitching</b> in parts. Some timber bridge components, {{such as the}} piles or headstocks of trestles, {{have been replaced by}} steel, or whole trestles have been replaced by concrete piers. There are a large number of small open concrete drains passing under the line. Early cast concrete pipes and culverts (not reinforced) along the line will be replaced with reinforced concrete pipes if the originals collapse.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, {{the club}} began to plan {{improvements}} to their ground and in 1951 raised £2,600 {{for a new}} pavilion. Plans for the pavilion were drawn by architect Jack Smith. The official opening ceremony was performed by former player Dr. Vernon Bell on Saturday 28 July, with a match between Norden and Fieldhouse. The pavilion was described in the souvenir programme: There are dressing rooms {{at either end of}} the building: a hall or assembly room in the centre, secretary's room and a large kitchen. The pavilion covers an area of 176 sq. yds. exclusive of the terracing which covers a further 70 sq. yds. Volunteer labour was used to bring the building up to floor level and the following materials were used: Stone ballast 62 tons. Sand 28 tons. Cement 9 tons. <b>Stone</b> <b>pitching</b> and filling 70 tons. Granite chipping 8 tons. Bricks 10,000. Ashes 30 tons. drain pipes, gutters etc.|$|E

2500|$|The pass at Rossett Gill {{provides}} a second major walking route out of Great Langdale, this path heading via Angle Tarn to Esk Hause. Whilst perhaps {{conceived as a}} means of reaching distant Wasdale, it is now more commonly used as a fellwalkers' springboard to the Scafells. Alfred Wainwright pilloried the route in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, describing it as [...] "almost certainly the least liked , due not to its steepness but its stoniness (a condition worsening year by year as swarming legions of booted pedestrians grind away the scanty vestiges of grass and soil)." [...] He suggested renewed use of the old 'Pony Route' which makes a more circuitous climb to the south. In more recent times the more direct route has seen considerable <b>stone</b> <b>pitching</b> and is much improved.|$|E

50|$|The {{section of}} the Etheridge Railway over the Newcastle range and through the Delaney Gorge has more {{earthworks}} {{than the rest of}} the railway. The railway track runs along the north face of the Delaney Gorge and along the bed of the Delaney River for a short distance. The significant elements within this {{section of the}} railway include any <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> bridge piers and abutments, <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> culverts, and <b>stone</b> cuttings. A large <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> culvert is located near Native Well, east of Wirra Wirra. A bridge over Starlight Creek, just east of Delaney Gorge, has stone piers and abutments, and a small bridge just east of Wirra Wirra has stone abutments. Bridges constructed with stonework are significant due to their rarity on the Etheridge line.|$|R

50|$|The stone-pitched ford crosses Byfield Creek in a north-south {{direction}} at {{a bearing}} of 20?. It has a rectangular frame of timber sleepers fitted together and secured by bolts, presumably iron coach bolts, {{and filled with}} <b>stone</b> <b>pitching</b> to create a causeway across the creek.|$|E
50|$|Technological {{features}} {{exist in}} the form of different road surfaces used to solve various problems encountered during construction.

50|$|A {{natural sand}} deposit on the {{southern}} bank of the creek is encroaching onto the crossing, and plant shoots are growing between the <b>stone</b> <b>pitching.</b> The log at the southern aspect is exposed for only a small portion, less than 50 cm, the remainder being covered by encroaching sand deposits, up to an approximate depth of 20 cm. Sediment deposits currently extend to approximately 4.6m {{from the point of}} the southern sleeper into the fording.|$|E
50|$|Water was {{a problem}} {{throughout}} the Croydon Goldfield and a large dam with a <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> wall was constructed in 1888, by a Mr. Shoemaker (or Schumacher). Even so the Homeward Bound battery could not crush that year.|$|R
50|$|The water {{race is a}} {{rare and}} {{uncommon}} example of its type and is the longest <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> water race recorded in North Queensland. It is unusual in its size, ranging to over 2m in height in places and with a total extent of up to 10 km in length.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of other {{features}} associated with the road, including stone extraction quarries, side cuttings, a system of catch drains and culverts occurring along the entire length of the roadway. Catch drains average about 50-75 centimetres in width and 20-25 centimetres in depth. Some of the drains are <b>stone</b> <b>pitched.</b>|$|R
50|$|Walkerwood Reservoir is {{the lowest}} {{reservoir}} {{of a series of}} four in the Brushes valley above Stalybridge in Greater Manchester, built in the 19th century to provide a supply of safe drinking water. It is owned and operated by United Utilities. The reservoir dam consists of a clay core within an earth embankment. The embankment was originally protected from erosion with <b>stone</b> <b>pitching.</b> At a later stage these were overlain with in-situ concrete slabs, which in turn have deteriorated over the years.|$|E
5000|$|From here, the tramway {{formation}} runs {{fairly close}} to the Herberton-Petford Road and is frequently visible, particularly for about a kilometer {{in the vicinity of}} Weinart Siding. There is <b>stone</b> <b>pitching</b> near to the road at [...] The base of a telegraph pole, broken insulators and a metal bracket for holding insulators were found nearby, between the tramway formation and the road. Small metal scatters, including rail spikes, were also found on or next to the tramway formation in this area.|$|E
5000|$|The Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) Building of Istanbul University {{is one of}} {{the larger}} faculty {{buildings}} of the university. It is situated in the Laleli neighborhood of Istanbul, Turkey. The building was constructed between 1942 and 1944. The architects were Sedat Hakkı Eldem (1908-1988) and Emin Halid Onat (1908-1961). The German architect Paul Bonatz (1877-1956) also acted as an adviser during his brief stay in Turkey. It {{is an example of the}} second national era in Turkish architecture which can be described as neoclassical. <b>Stone</b> <b>pitching</b> faces, arcades, and colonnades are apparent.|$|E
50|$|Most of Gallop Botanical Reserve has open sclerophyll {{vegetation}} {{consisting of}} Melaleuca spp, Eucalypts spp (Bloodwood), Cooktown Ironwood and various grasses. The Cooktown Botanic Gardens, consisting of 3.5 hectares within the Gallop Botanic Reserve, is vegetated with similar species of native trees, but interspersed with the indigenous vegetation are formal lawned areas, <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> waterways and planted exotic species.|$|R
50|$|The {{surviving}} railway buildings, rails, sidings, turning forks, cattle yards, loading banks, <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> {{bridges and}} culverts, stone cuttings, sandboxes (for refilling the sand-dispensing units {{in front of}} train wheels), water tank, signage, and signals and points infrastructure at the Mount Surprise, Einasleigh and Forsayth railway stations and along the Etheridge Railway between Mount Surprise and Forsayth are significant.|$|R
60|$|We passed on, {{and emerged}} beyond the village, {{still on the}} {{descending}} great high-road that was mended with loose <b>stones</b> <b>pitched</b> on it. This wasn't good enough. Besides, {{we were out of}} the sun, and the place being at a considerable elevation, it was very cold. So we turned back, to climb quickly uphill into the sun.|$|R
5000|$|Rainforest {{understorey}} plants {{line the}} creek bank and pathways {{in this area}} and again the association of a blue quandong, paperbarks and a Leichhardt tree is seen. The 1960s figure-of-eight walkway has persisted and Fitzalan Creek is crossed by two footbridges. The southern portion of the gully area has the oldest paving. A variety of paving materials are used, including bricks, concrete slabs and concrete [...] "crazy paving." [...] Retaining walls reflect this pattern: log retaining walls and concrete <b>stone</b> <b>pitching</b> in southern parts give way to block walls in northern areas.|$|E
50|$|The <b>stone</b> <b>pitching</b> extends {{into the}} {{northern}} embankment past the water-mark. Within the crossing some stones have become loose and dislodged from their positions, {{which may be}} a result of natural erosion (scouring), or from motor-vehicles. Some subsidence has occurred, with the level of some stones lower in position compared to others, and cracking of some stones is evident. The predominant area of weathering and subsidence occurs {{in the middle of the}} ford, where water appears to be permanent to semi-permanent. This part of the ford is the most vulnerable to erosion associated with high water velocity during flooding.|$|E
50|$|The water race is {{representative}} of practices used for the extraction of base metal resources in north Queensland and is significant as an early example of the effort, both manual and financial, that was applied to mine base metals in a remote location reliant on seasonal rains. Many of the principal characteristics of the race survive, including the two channels or ditches (surviving for close to its original 10 km extent), excavated material forming banks on the downhill side of the race, evidence of blasting {{along the sides of}} the race, a rock tunnel, a ventilation shaft to the tunnel, <b>stone</b> <b>pitching,</b> and remnant flume supports and fluming.|$|E
50|$|A boiler and a {{compressor}} {{are located in}} association with shafts and workings at {{the western end of}} the place. Adjacent are the remains of two small buildings constructed with flagstone surfaces and <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> wall sections. The purpose of these structures is not evident, although they may have been lock-up stores. The camp comprises the remains of a corrugated iron shed and a stove and fridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{surviving}} railway buildings, rails, sidings, turning forks, cattle yards, loading banks, <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> {{bridges and}} culverts, stone cuttings, sandboxes, water tank, signage, and signals and points infrastructure at the Mount Surprise, Einasleigh and Forsayth railway stations {{and along the}} Etheridge Railway between Mount Surprise and Forsayth all demonstrate the principal characteristics of a railway line that was used for mining and pastoral purposes.|$|R
