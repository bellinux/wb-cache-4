25|$|The Anniversary series found {{prominence}} with Joe Satriani in particular, who favoured {{the early}} EL34 powered versions and used only the clean channel live {{along with his}} signature Vox Satchurator distortion pedal {{which is based on}} his old modded Boss DS-1. Satriani used these older Boss pedals almost exclusively for live work and on a number of studio albums including The Extremist (1992) until the early 2000s. The Anniversary models were probably the most complicated Marshall ever (other than perhaps the later JVM), with MIDI channel selection, half power switching, pentode/triode switching, adjustable speaker excursion, and a low volume compensation switch. Despite all this complication the amps had a pure <b>signal</b> <b>path</b> that did not share preamp tubes between channels (unlike later Marshall designs like the TSL and JVM). Other famous 6100 users included Alex Lifeson on Rush's album Test for Echo (1996) and Ocean Colour Scene (OCS) guitarist Steve Cradock.|$|E
25|$|The load that {{a driver}} {{presents}} to an amplifier {{consists of a}} complex electrical impedance—a combination of resistance and both capacitive and inductive reactance, which combines properties of the driver, its mechanical motion, the effects of crossover components (if any are in the <b>signal</b> <b>path</b> between amplifier and driver), {{and the effects of}} air loading on the driver as modified by the enclosure and its environment. Most amplifiers' output specifications are given at a specific power into an ideal resistive load; however, a loudspeaker does not have a constant impedance across its frequency range. Instead, the voice coil is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonances, the enclosure changes the driver's electrical and mechanical characteristics, and a passive crossover between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its own variations. The result is a load impedance that varies widely with frequency, and usually a varying phase relationship between voltage and current as well, also changing with frequency. Some amplifiers can cope with the variation better than others can.|$|E

25|$|A {{dedicated}} {{voltage comparator}} chip such as LM339 {{is designed to}} interface with a digital logic interface (to a TTL or a CMOS). The output is a binary state often used to interface real world signals to digital circuitry (see analog to digital converter). If there is a fixed voltage source from, for example, a DC adjustable device in the <b>signal</b> <b>path,</b> a comparator is just {{the equivalent of a}} cascade of amplifiers. When the voltages are nearly equal, the output voltage will not fall into one of the logic levels, thus analog signals will enter the digital domain with unpredictable results. To make this range as small as possible, the amplifier cascade is high gain. The circuit consists of mainly Bipolar transistors. For very high frequencies, the input impedance of the stages is low. This reduces the saturation of the slow, large P-N junction bipolar transistors that would otherwise lead to long recovery times. Fast small Schottky diodes, like those found in binary logic designs, improve the performance significantly though the performance still lags that of circuits with amplifiers using analog signals. Slew rate has no meaning for these devices. For applications in flash ADCs the distributed signal across eight ports matches the voltage and current gain after each amplifier, and resistors then behave as level-shifters.|$|E

2500|$|A {{feedback}} suppressor detects unwanted audio feedback and suppresses it, typically by automatically inserting a notch filter into the <b>signal</b> <b>path</b> of the system, which prevents feedback [...] "howls" [...] from occurring. Audio feedback can create unwanted loud, screaming noises which are disruptive to the performance, and which can damage performers' and audience members' ears and speakers. Audio feedback from microphones {{occurs when a}} microphone [...] "hears" [...] the sound it is picking up through the monitor speakers or the main speakers. While microphone audio feedback is almost universally regarded as a negative phenomenon, in hard rock and heavy metal music, electric guitarists purposely create guitar feedback to create unique, sustained sounds with their guitar and guitar amplifier. This type of feedback is sought out by guitarists, so the sound engineer does not try to prevent it.|$|E

2500|$|One {{technique}} is to insert the compressor {{in a parallel}} <b>signal</b> <b>path.</b> This is known as parallel compression, a form of upward compression, which can give a measure of dynamic control without significant audible side effects, if the ratio is relatively low and the compressor's sound is relatively neutral. On the other hand, a high compression ratio with significant audible artifacts can be chosen {{in one of the}} two parallel signal paths—this is used by some concert mixers and recording engineers as an artistic effect called New York compression or Motown compression. Combining a linear signal with a compressor and then reducing the output gain of the compression chain results in low-level detail enhancement without any peak reduction (since the compressor significantly adds to the combined gain at low levels only). This is often beneficial when [...] compressing transient content, since it maintains high-level dynamic liveliness, despite reducing the overall dynamic range.|$|E
2500|$|In the Cassegrain and Gregorian antennas, the {{presence}} of two reflecting surfaces in the <b>signal</b> <b>path</b> offers additional possibilities for improving performance. [...] When the highest performance is required, a technique called [...] "dual reflector shaping" [...] may be used. [...] This involves changing {{the shape of the}} sub-reflector to direct more signal power to outer areas of the dish, to map the known pattern of the feed into a uniform illumination of the primary, to maximize the gain. However, this results in a secondary that is no longer precisely hyperbolic (though it is still very close), so the constant phase property is lost. [...] This phase error, however, can be compensated for by slightly tweaking the shape of the primary mirror. [...] The result is a higher gain, or gain/spillover ratio, at the cost of surfaces that are trickier to fabricate and test. [...] Other dish illumination patterns can also be synthesized, such as patterns with high taper at the dish edge for ultra-low spillover sidelobes, and patterns with a central [...] "hole" [...] to reduce feed shadowing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next step}} in the <b>signal</b> <b>path</b> {{generally}} depends {{on the size of the}} system in place. [...] In smaller systems, the main outputs are often sent to an additional equalizer, or directly to a power amplifier, with one or more loudspeakers (typically two, one on each side of the stage in smaller venues, or a large number in big venues) that are connected to that amplifier. [...] In large-format systems, the signal is typically first routed through an equalizer then to a crossover. [...] A crossover splits the signal into multiple frequency bands with each band being sent to separate amplifiers and speaker enclosures for low, middle, and high-frequency signals. [...] Low-frequency signals are sent to amplifiers and then to subwoofers, and middle and high-frequency sounds are typically sent to amplifiers which power full-range speaker cabinets. Using a crossover to separate the sound into low, middle and high frequencies can lead to a [...] "cleaner", clearer sound (see bi-amplification) than routing all of the frequencies through a single full-range speaker system. Nevertheless, many small venues still use a single full-range speaker system, as it is easier to set up and less expensive.|$|E
