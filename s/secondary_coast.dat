[...] The railroad diverged from the CNJ main line at Elizabethport and ran to South Amboy, where the New York and Long Branch Railroad (NY&LB) would go on to Bay Head. South of a junction with the Perth Amboy and Woodbridge Railroad in Perth Amboy, the Pennsylvania Railroad had trackage rights to connect with the jointly-controlled NY&LB; this portion was electrified in 1935. When the CNJ terminal in Jersey City closed, CNJ trains would run to Newark where passengers transferred to Pennsylvania Railroad or PATH trains to New York City.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} COAST {{project is}} to {{establish}} a long-term research program exploringing new approaches to computer security and computer system management in a first-class educational environment. The principal focus will be on techniques and tools for common, off-the shelf (COTS) systems without military-grade security (in the traditional DoD TCSEC, "Orange Book" sense), especially legacy systems in wide-spread use. We anticipate that the work we do in this area will also aid in the development of future systems. A <b>secondary</b> goal of <b>COAST</b> is to advance the state of education in computer security, and includes the establishment of a dedicated, dual-use laboratory. We intend for our research to be broad-based and to draw from experience and expertise in other areas of computing such as software engineering, language design, operating systems, computer networking, and databases. It will also draw on expertise in related non-computer areas, as appropriate to advance our goals. COAST is s [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The northward {{shift of}} the subarctic climate zone is {{allowing}} animals that are adapted to that climate {{to move into the}} far north, where they are replacing species that are more adapted to a pure Arctic climate. Where the Arctic species are not being replaced outright, they are often interbreeding with their southern relations. Among slow-breeding vertebrate species, this often has the effect of reducing the genetic diversity of the genus. Another concern is the spread of infectious diseases, such as brucellosis or phocine distemper virus, to previously untouched populations. This is a particular danger among marine mammals who were previously segregated by sea ice.3 April 2007, the National Wildlife Federation urged the United States Congress to place polar bears under the Endangered Species Act.Four months later, the United States Geological Survey completed a year-long study which concluded in part that the floating Arctic sea ice will continue its rapid shrinkage over the next 50 years, consequently wiping out much of the polar bear habitat.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} inquiry of {{the experiences}} of six African American women high school principals, current and recently exited from east <b>coast</b> <b>secondary</b> schools, employs in-depth interviews and a focus group. Through interviews I explored these secondary school leaders’ personal and professional experiences to reveal their perspectives on the ways identity informs their ability to influence others, shape professional relationships, and enact leadership in their secondary schools. Identity was also an important influence {{on their ability to}} strategically navigate power relations within and beyond their school contexts. The experiences and perspectives of African American women school leaders in secondary settings have been under-represented in the educational leadership scholarship; this study seeks to contribute to an emergent body of literature in this area. As national demographics change and more school leadership vacancies emerge, African American women leaders represent a viable candidate pool. The experiences of current African American women school leaders are valuable perspectives for leader preparation programs. This study seeks to enrich and extend educational leadership discourse and leader preparation programs, which have not fully recognized this talent pool. The findings from this study point toward ways {{that can be used to}} shape leader preparation programs and leadership recruitment efforts. Finally, this study aims to generate and share information which may support the successful navigation of this growing population of leaders within metropolitan settings, as urban school leadership changes and new positions emerge. ...|$|R
40|$|Various {{theoretical}} {{approaches have}} accompanied {{the history of}} art development, with certain cultural products selected to represent 'art' most popularly defined in the Classical and Romantic periods of European art production. The rise of mass culture, and the changing relations of production, in the new industrial world have served to highlight the unequal access to power, status and rewards accorded to cultural products deemed 'art' as opposed to 'culture' under these definitions. The ideologies of what constitutes art seem to disadvantage certain ethnic groups such as the Maori. This highlights fundamental conflicts between the definition of 'art' according to an imported European culture and an indigenous Maori culture. The case of 'Te Maori' exhibition 1984 - 1985 raises the issue as to whether the selection of cultural products in New Zealand according to a European art aesthetic has been congenial to the development of Maori art. Alternatively, has it merely served as 'potent defence' of the current social structure of art. Cultural definitions have increasingly become an issue in education at a broader level, as educational attainment of secondary school leavers has continued to be disproportionately lower for Maori than Pakeha as our nation fails to fulfil its development aims to promote equity for all social groups in New Zealand. Particular theories on the cultural 'mismatch' between Maori culture and the dominant 'habitus' of the secondary school have had some support from research into Maori career expectations, and point to the education system perpetuating social inequalities rather than addressing them. The selection of art as a worthy cultural product, as formalised in secondary school art studies, may similarly act to support the subversion of Maori art forms in their function as communicator, transmitter and recorder of Maori identity and culture. Art is defined in secondary schools according to the prevailing Pakeha dominant ideology. Firstly the recognition of traditional Maori art is considered in terms of correct rendering of basic elements, and for a range of traditional Maori art. The importance of traditional Maori art contexts is discussed in light of the formal elements of Maori art and the wholeness of Maori culture and the school art syllabus is examined for its attention to these factors. Pupil knowledge and attitudes are surveyed in art classes of a particular East <b>Coast</b> <b>secondary</b> school and the results are compared according to ethnic groupings and gender differences, {{with a small group of}} Maori students from another East Coast school who have not had formal secondary school art education. Maori art has a history and tradition that has evolved to encompass and embrace new elements, while still holding true to many traditional cultural contexts. It demonstrates continued growth and development in new contexts. Particular contexts are examined; art production and art significance inside the traditional meeting house. Methods and concepts are explored in the test schools to hypothesise on the level and requirements of contextualisation of Maori art in secondary schools. The contemporary presence of Maori art, the viability and nature of this presence, is then examined in the light of judgements made by secondary school students towards certain contemporary Maori art works by Maori and non-Maori artists. This serves to highlight the criteria students are using to judge Maori art as 'Maori' and whether Maori art forms are being accorded a development and continuity - an inherent value - of their own. Explanation of the tendency for education to ignore the needs of Maori and society towards Maori art cultural products is explored in the light of theories of the reproductive nature of education, and the findings in this particular research...|$|R
