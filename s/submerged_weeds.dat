The phenomenon of directing the flow to the right side has been observed during an experimental study in a trapezoidal channel infested by <b>submerged</b> <b>weeds.</b> It is observed that the flow increases in one side of the stream compared with the other side causing a non-uniform velocity distribution. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to investigate this phenomenon and deduce the velocity distributions in channel infested by <b>submerged</b> <b>weeds.</b> Many experimental runs were carried out and the velocity distributions were measured for several sections.

Through this study, the noxious and competitive weed of rice {{were identified and}} counted, which should be helpful in developing a more sustainable weed control and management. This study was conducted at 24 different rice field covering four types of planting practices in Seberang Perai and MUDA area, namely wet seeding, water seeding, manual transplanting and mechanical transplanting method, using 0. 5 x 0. 5 m size quadrat with 20 samples for each field during rice at tillering to heading stage.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{vegetation}} {{is often an}} important consideration in hydraulic engineering. The design flowrate for hydraulic structures reflects the amount of overland flow and storage, {{both of which are}} affected by vegetal resistance. In open channels, the energy loss from the flow through and above vegetation affects the water surface profile, which could result in flooding. The velocity distribution, pressure distribution, and boundary shear stress distribution are also affected by the hydraulic resistance of the vegetation. Knowledge of these flow parameters is typically needed for the design of hydraulic structures. The density, extent, and type of vegetation present affect the capacity of water supply and flood diversion canals. Canals designed with earth linings can be susceptible to weed infestation, which can increase flow depth and lead to overbank flow or increased seepage, or which can create flow concentrations leading to increased erosion. The Research Institute for Weed Control and Channel Maintenance in Cairo, Egypt estimated that 10 % of the earth-lined canal length in Egypt is infested with emergent weeds, and 50 % is infested with <b>submerged</b> <b>weeds</b> (Balay, Gates and Khattab, 1992). Grass lining is frequently used in irrigation canals, spillways, terraces. and roadside ditches. The condition and type of the grass directly influence channel capacity and stability. As with earth-lined channels, weed maintenance plays a significant role in channel performance (Temple, Robinson, Ahring, and Davis, 1987) ...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. (Zoology) Ari {{investigation}} {{was made into}} the biological control of the submerged aquatic weeds Potamogeton pectinatus, Lagarosiphon major and L. muscoides in the Florida Lake, Transvaal using the Chinese grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella (Val.) as biological control agent. The physical, chemical (including selected heavy metals), faunal and bacteriological conditions were also investigated {{over a period of}} one year. The total standing crop of P. pectinatusand Lagarosiphon spp, were reduced from an initial 0, 193 kg m" 2 (wet mass) in March 1990 to 0, 0338 kg m- 2 (wet mass) in March 1991. Reductions in the densities of the macrophytes coincided with a corresponding increase in chIorophyll-a values in the water columm of the lake. Abnormally high concentrations of the heavy metals copper, manganese, iron, nickel chromium, zinc and lead were found to occur in the lake sediments, aquatic macrophytes, ftlamentous algae, macroinvertebrate fauna as well as in organs and tissues of the perch Perea fluviatilis. These metals could be related to gold mining activities which occurred {{in the vicinity of the}} lake some years ago. Faecal bacterial counts of the water in the lake point towards the possible contamination of the lake water with domestic sewage. Ari analysis of the faeces of the numerically dominant birds which occur at the lake i. e. the coot Fulica aistata and the egyptian goose Alopochen aegyptiacus suggest that the main cause of faecal contamination of the lake's water possibly originates from these and other water birds frequenting the lake. By using the results on the physical-chemical conditions in the lake, conditions which presently prevail can be summarized as being largely that of a mesotrophic impoundment with strong tendencies towards eutrophic conditions. Secondary effects of the grass carp on the lake ecosystem was the progressive decline of weed eating birds and a slight increase in the numbers of piscivorous birds, both of which could be linked to the drastic reduction in the standing crop of the <b>submerged</b> <b>weeds</b> in the Lake. The present survey confirms the value of the Chinese grass carp as biological control agent in the management of excessive growths of submerged aquatic weeds in lakes and reservoirs in South Africa [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In Egypt, {{constructing}} the Aswan High Dam (AHD) across the Nile River caused alterations of the aquatic ecosystem specially the aquatic weed community structures. The high aquatic weed infestations {{caused a lot}} of problems by creating losses of water, retardation of flow, interference with navigation, health hazards and alteration in the physico-chemical characteristics of both water and hydrosoil. The AHD provided routes for some aquatic weed species to the Nile system where they had been previously absent, or they caused permanent elimination for some of them within the Lake Nasser, Aswan Reservoir, Nile River, and waterways (canals and drains). In the Lake Nasser, two aquatic macrophyte species were eliminated and six species were introduced. In addition, the phytoplankton primary productions have become high throughout the year. The mean density and prevalence of the <b>submerged</b> aquatic <b>weeds</b> are greatly influenced by the high water level fluctuation, hydrosoil texture and nutrients. In the Aswan Reservoir, the <b>submerged</b> aquatic <b>weed,</b> Ceratophyllum demersum has become dominant because it has an ability to tolerate severe water fluctuation near the littoral zone. In the Nile River and waterways, the water level regime has been regulated.

40|$|Stronger {{growth in}} many plants stimulated by {{increased}} CO 2 concentration {{should lead to}} greater biological productivity with an expected increase in the photosynthetic storage of carbon. Thus, the biosphere {{will serve as a}} sink for CO 2, though it will also act as a source too, because of respiration. Normally net photosynthesis dominates in summer and removes CO 2 from the atmosphere, whereas respiration dominates in winter and releases CO 2 in the atmosphere. However in the tropics where day length is quite long with about 10 + or – 2 hours throughout the year, net photosynthesis is expected to dominate. In this background utilization of CO 2 as an industrial by-product for seaweed production holds great promise not only in acting as a significant sink, but also in meeting to some extent global food, fodder, fuel and pharmaceutical requirements, particularly in the tropics. It {{is interesting to note that}} 3. 5 tons of alga production utilizes 1. 27 tons of carbon and about 0. 22 tons of nitrogen and 0. 03 tons of phosphorus.

40|$|Submerged {{aquatic plants}} pose {{problems}} in Australian and New Zealand waterways for navigation, flood management, bank erosion, recreation and aesthetics. Among problematic species are: Lagarosiphon (Lagarosiphon major (Ridley) Moss), Egeria (Egeria densa Planch.), Hornwort (Ceratophyllum demersum L.) and Elodea (Elodea canadensis Michx.). These species prefer clear water, where they form dense stands. The problem in controlling these plants relates to their mode of spread; the smallest viable vegetative fragment can re-establish a population. Left uncontained, these aquatic weeds {{are likely to}} fully colonize all available habitats, within {{a short period of}} time. Recent advances in application technology have allowed the safe use of aquatic herbicides in control programs. A new technique for applying the aquatic herbicide- Diquat for the control of submerged aquatics has been developed in New Zealand. This method involves the use of guar gum, and formulating a Diquat gel form (Hydrogelâ), which can then be applied to water. Hydrogel provides a greater degree of control, and allows the targeting of specific areas while significantly reducing offsite herbicide drift. Treatment trials of the formula “Hydrogel”, were undertaken at a number of sites in New Zealand and NSW, against a range of <b>submerged</b> aquatic <b>weeds.</b> Results indicate that control can be achieved at significantly less cost than control by mechanical and other means. Water quality monitoring results show negligible herbicide residues downstream of the treatment sites. Future trials will be undertaken to assess the long-term control options for aquatic weeds using Hydrogel and other aquatic herbicides. Larger-scale trials will be undertaken to assess the environmental fate of herbicides in water and the wider aquatic ecosystem. The ability to use herbicide for the control of <b>submerged</b> aquatic <b>weeds</b> will significantly improve the cost-effectiveness and environmental effects of river control works, channel clearing and dam maintenance in the future...|$|R

The Bridgewater Creek "pond system", consisted of a sediment basin and five ponds. Suspended solids were reduced during wet weather, but increased during dry weather due to resuspension by ducks. NO 3 -N decreased in both wet and dry weather. NH 4 -N increased probably due to ammonification of organic matter. PO 4 -P decreased. The removal of soluble NO 3 and PO 4 is indicative of biological uptake by phytoplankton <b>submerged</b> pond <b>weeds</b> and periphyton attached to aquatic macrophytes. Macroinvertebrate species richness increased, and mosquitoes were not a problem due to predation of larvae by macroinvertebrates.

40|$|The {{integrity}} of South Africa’s valuable freshwater ecosystems has been threatened by aquatic invasive plants since the 1900 s. Floating aquatic weeds, such as Eichhornia crassipes (C. Mart) Solms (Pondederiaceae), Pistia stratiotes L. (Araceae), Salvinia molesta D. S. Mitchell (Salviniaceae), Azolla filiculoides Lam. (Azollaceae), and the emergent weed, Myriophyllum aquaticum Verdc. (Haloragaceae) benefited from open, nutrient-rich water bodies. Due to {{the limitations of}} mechanical and chemical control in aquatic environments, classical biological control {{has been a huge}} asset in managing these weeds; consequently bringing them under complete or substantial control. However, <b>submerged</b> aquatic <b>weeds</b> are widely distributed through the aquarium trade in South Africa; facilitating their invasion into new habitats. The removal of surface mats following the successful management of floating weeds has enhanced the growth and competitive ability of <b>submerged</b> aquatic <b>weeds,</b> such as Hydrilla verticillata (L. f.) Royle (Hydrocharitaceae), Myriophyllum spicatum L. (Haloragaceae) and Egeria densa Planch. (Hydrocharitaceae) in South Africa. Of these species, E. densa has become the most widely distributed, invading numerous systems across South Africa. Compared to other exotic submerged aquatic plants, E. densa is the only species capable of inhabiting freshwater systems in every province and therefore, it is vital to manage existing populations and prevent its further distribution and invasion. Hydrellia spp. (Diptera: Ephydridae) biological control agents have been used extensively in the management of <b>submerged</b> aquatic <b>weeds</b> elsewhere, particularly those in the Hydrocharitaceae (Balciunas and Burrows 1996; Wheeler and Center 2001. Hydrellia egeriae Rodrigues (Diptera: Ephydridae) has been identified as a promising candidate for E. densa and was imported into quarantine at Rhodes University, Grahamstown in 2014. The aims of this study were to conduct a pre-release assessment of the potential of H. egeriae as a biological control agent for E. densa in South Africa. The first objective {{of this study was to}} establish the life history of the agent under controlled conditions on E. densa found in South Africa, as well as its population growth parameters to predict its invasion success in the field. Secondly, laboratory host-specificity testing was conducted to validate the host range of the agent, in view of published native range host-specificity testing, and to establish potential risks to non-target species, should it be released. Finally, a biological control agent should also effectively reduce the fitness of its host plant, and therefore, impact studies were conducted. Laboratory impact studies have been limited in the past, in that they only investigate agent damage for short ecological periods, thus underestimating the damage capacity of the agent under investigation. Therefore, the damage capacity of H. egeriae was investigated over three consecutive generations in multi-generational impact trials. In a controlled environment of 22 ± 2 °C, H. egeriae exhibited the ability to rapidly increase in population size within a short period of time, which will enhance agent establishment and build-up in the field. Host-specificity trials indicated that H. egeriae has a host range restricted to the Hydrocharitaceae, with exploratory feeding and development on Lagarosiphon major Ridley, L. muscoides Harvey and Vallisneria spiralis L. However, only L. major supported agent development during paired larval choice tests, and continuation trials showed that the test species was not physiologically capable of supporting viable agent populations. Risk analysis illustrated that the feeding and reproductive risks that H. egeriae pose to non-target species are very low and therefore, H. egeriae should be safe for release in South Africa. Additionally, significant damage to vital plant structures (shoot growth and side shoot length) was only recorded under high (five larvae) agent abundances. Encouragingly, the number of leaves mined at the end of the experiment was similar for both intermediate (three) and high (five) larval abundances, suggesting that cumulative leaf-mining under intermediate larval abundances has the potential to reduce the fitness of E. densa, given sufficient time. Results from pre-release assessments provide a robust understanding of the specialization of the potential biological control agent to its host plant. Nevertheless, the absolute success of a biological control programme depends on the many factors after prerelease assessments that determine agent establishment, persistence and target weed suppression, e. g. mass-rearing, release protocols and a/biotic factors within the recipient community. Considering these factors, the best mass-rearing and release protocols are proposed here and future research priorities are identified. Finally, the long term success for managing E. densa in South Africa will require a holistic approach to address the underlying factors, such as eutrophication and human-mediated distribution that drive submerged aquatic plant invasions...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of classical biocontrol in managing exotic aquatic weeds, such as Lagarosiphon major Ridley (Hydrocharitaceae) (coarse oxygen-weed) in New Zealand (N. Z.) and Europe, and augmentation biocontrol in managing native weeds, such as L. major, L. muscoides Harvey (Hydrocharitaceae) (fine oxygen-weed) and Potamogeton pectinatus L. (Potamogetonaceae) (sago pondweed) in South Africa (S. A.) is being {{hampered by the}} dearth of knowledge surrounding submerged macrophytes and their associated insect assemblages. In addition, this knowledge gap hinders the accurate evaluation of any biocontrol initiatives that are implemented. These facts are even more sobering when considering the global number of invasive species is ever increasing, for example the recent invasion of S. A. by the <b>submerged</b> <b>weed,</b> Hydrilla verticillata. To begin addressing these issues, this study surveyed the invertebrates associated with three of S. A. ’s indigenous submerged macrophytes, L. major, L. muscoides and P. pectinatus, while investigating the role certain environmental variables (site, plant species, nutrient levels, light penetration, water depth and distance from the shore) played in shaping these insect assemblages. In surveying these plant species on two dams within the Mooi River district of S. A., the following herbivorous insects were identified: Athripsodes harrisoni (Trichoptera: Leptoceridae), Leptocerus sp. (Trichoptera: Leptoceridae), Parapoynx fluctuosalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), Micronectus scutellaris (Hemiptera: Corixidae), M. dorothea (Hemiptera: Corixidae) and species from the Chironominae (Diptera: Chironomidae) and Orthocladiinae (Diptera: Chironomidae). Of these, A. harrisoni and Leptocerus sp. showed the most promise of being destructive, host-specific agents to manage L. major in N. Z. and Europe; consequently, they require further investigation. Concerning the use of augmentation control in managing the three plant species within S. A., all the herbivorous insects have potential as future agents. However, nitrate to phosphate ratios of below ten in the sampled dams have resulted in excess nutrients being available to all three plant species; resulting in their growth and spread throughout the dams not being hampered by the feeding of the phytophagous insects. Again, this highlights the need to address eutrophication {{in the management of}} all S. A. ’s aquatic weeds. The herbivorous fauna found in this study may also have the potential to be important in the management of H. verticillata in S. A., given the fact that this weed and Lagarosiphon are from the Hydrocharitaceae family. In addition to the herbivorous insects, 18 morphospecies from 10 insect families were found associated with L. major, 14 morphospecies from nine families with L. muscoides, and 19 morphospecies from 11 families with P. pectinatus. The evenness of the insect communities associated with all three plant species was very similar; however, their species richness was significantly different. Consequently, the community of P. pectinatus was the most diverse (Fisher’s alpha of 4. 74), while that of L. muscoides was the least (Fisher’s alpha of 2. 95). Of the environmental variables investigated at the 10 replicate sites for each plant species, different sites, different plant species and surrounding land use were important in shaping the communities. In addition, this study highlights the feasibility of local research institutes surveying the insect assemblages associated with their indigenous macrophyte species, which are weeds or potential weeds elsewhere. This could be a very cost effective procedure of refining global biocontrol...|$|R
40|$|Auckland Council (AC) is {{responsible}} for the development and operation of a stormwater network across the region to avert risks to citizens and the environment. Within this stormwater network, aquatic vegetation (including plants, unicellular and filamentous algae) can have both a positive and negative role in stormwater management and water quality treatment. The situations where management is needed to control aquatic vegetation are not always clear, and an inability to identify effective, feasible and economical control options may constrain management initiatives. AC (Infrastructure and Technical Services, Stormwater) commissioned this technical report to provide information for decision- making on aquatic vegetation management with in stormwater systems that are likely to experience vegetation-related issues. Information was collated from a comprehensive literature review, augmented by knowledge held by the authors. This review identified a wide range of management practices that could be potentially employed. It also demonstrated complexities and uncertainties relating to these options that makes the identification of a best management practice difficult. Hence, the focus of this report was to enable users to screen for potential options, and use reference material provided on each option to confirm the best practice to employ for each situation. The report identifies factors to define whether there is an aquatic vegetation problem (Section 3. 0), and emphasises the need for agreed management goals for control (e. g. reduction, mitigation, containment, eradication). Resources to screen which management option(s) to employ are provided (Section 4. 0), relating to the target aquatic vegetation, likely applicability of options to the system being managed, indicative cost, and ease of implementation. Initial screening allows users to shortlist potential control options for further reference (Section 5. 0). Thirty-five control options are described (Section 5. 0) in sufficient detail to consider applicability to individual sites and species. These options are grouped under categories of biological, chemical or physical control. Biological control options involve the use of organisms to predate, infect or control vegetation growth (e. g. classical biological control) or manipulate conditions to control algal growth (e. g. pest fish removal, microbial products). Chemical control options involve the use of pesticides and chemicals (e. g. glyphosate, diquat), or the use of flocculants and nutrient inactivation products that are used to reduce nutrient loading, thereby decreasing algal growth. Physical control options involve removing vegetation or algal biomass (e. g. mechanical or manual harvesting), or setting up barriers to their growth (e. g. shading, bottom lining, sediment capping). Preventative management options are usually the most cost effective, and these are also briefly described (Section 6. 0). For example, the use of hygiene or quarantine protocols can reduce weed introductions or spread. Catchment- based practices to reduce sediment and nutrient sources to stormwater are likely to assist in the avoidance of algal and possibly aquatic plant problems. Nutrient removal may be a co-benefit where harvesting of <b>submerged</b> <b>weed</b> biomass is undertaken in stormwater systems. It should also be considered that removal of substantial amounts of submerged vegetation may result in a sudden and difficult-to-reverse s witch to a turbid, phytoplankton dominated state. Another possible solution is the conversion of systems that experience aquatic vegetation issues, to systems that are less likely to experience issues. The focus of this report is on systems that receive significant stormwater inputs, i. e. constructed bodies, including ponds, amenity lakes, wetlands, and highly-modified receiving bodies. However, some information will have application to other natural water bodies...|$|R

In this study, 28 taxa of Odonata larvae were collected from three stations (upper, middle and lower) of a polluted river in Malaysia. The upper river basin receives effluents from an oil palm plantation. However, the middle station is presumably contaminated with anthropogenic wastes. The lower station is found to receive polluted discharges from aquaculture outlet. Several environmental parameters of water and sediment were continuously measured during the study. The water parameters showed no significant differences amongst the three stations. The species richness of Odonata was 22, 24 and 20 in the upper, middle and lower stations, respectively. The abundance of Odonata was significantly different among the studied sites. The tolerant damselfly, Pseudagrion sp. (41. 22 %), and facultative dragonflies, Onychothemis sp.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the impacts on charophytes of four selected aquatic herbicide and a mycoherbicide products currently used or under development in New Zealand for alien invasive aquatic plant management. Of particular interest was the charophyte response with respect to oospore germination, germling susceptibility and species response. In New Zealand, charophytes are native submerged aquatic plants which are recognized as beneficial components of lake ecosystems. They form dense meadows on the lake sediment and are rapid colonisers as they are the first plant to recolonise a lake after a disturbance event. Charophytes produce oospores (seeds) which can remain dormant in seed banks until suitable germination conditions are met. New Zealand lake sediments contain a seed bank which is dominated by charophyte oospores. Alien invasive plants severely impact charophytes by rapidly forming tall, dense monospecific stands which can displace and completely replace the native vegetation. Chemical weed control in New Zealand is limited to two aquatic herbicides, diquat and endothall, which are currently registered for use on <b>submerged</b> aquatic <b>weeds</b> in lakes and waterways. Fluridone, which is widely used in the USA, is not currently registered for commercial use in New Zealand but has been used in several New Zealand studies. More recently, the development of a mycoherbicide, an inundative biological control, using a formulated naturally occurring aquatic fungus has been trialed in the USA and New Zealand. The effects of these four products on charophytes were investigated in this study. Chelated copper was included as a control, as it is known to control algae, including charophytes overseas. For this research, lake sediment was collected from three New Zealand lakes and combined to give one mixed seed bank material of known oospore density and composition. There were two types of charophyte experiments; germination experiments and germling experiments. Two germination experiments examined different scenarios for herbicide treatments under controlled temperature and light conditions. Oospores were either retained in sediment or directly exposed to treatment. Two germling experiments examined germling susceptibility to herbicide treatments under outdoor conditions as well as controlled temperature and light conditions. The second germling experiment included a known charophyte control treatment (chelated copper compound) and a known target invasive plant (Lagarosiphon major) control treatment for the herbicides. Herbicide treatment doses started at the maximum label rate and decreased in concentration across a dilution series. Results from this research indicate that oospore germination was not negatively impacted by any of the herbicide treatments or doses although some species-specific sensitivity was evident. However, further research into species sensitivity is required to ascertain if the sensitivity was due to herbicidal effects or a combination of naturally occurring factors and what the implications of sensitivity are for weed management. For the germling experiments no negative effects were observed {{for the duration of the}} study. These results have positive implications for field application of herbicides, indicating that the younger charophyte growth stages (oospores and germlings) were unaffected by the type of herbicide used at any potential field application rate...|$|R
