These items became so symbolic of the Cynic vocation that ancient writers accosted those who thought that donning the Cynic garb would make them suited to the philosophy.|$|E

5|$|In {{the social}} {{evolution}} from the archaic age to the classical, the public ceased carrying weapons into the poleis. Originally {{it was expected}} that one carried a sword while in the city; However, a transition to spears, and then to staffs occurred until wearing any weapon in the city became a foolish old custom. Thus, the very act of carrying a <b>staff</b> <b>was</b> slightly taboo itself. According to modern theorists, the symbol of the <b>staff</b> <b>was</b> one which both functions as a tool to signal the user’s dissociation from physical labour, that is, as a display of conspicuous leisure, {{and at the same time}} it also has an association with sport and typically plays a part in hunting and sports clothing. Thus, it displays active and warlike qualities, rather than being a symbol of a weak man’s need to support himself. The staff itself became a message of how the Cynic was free through its possible interpretation as an item of leisure, but, just as equivalent, was its message of strength - a virtue held in abundance by the Cynic philosopher.|$|E

The design <b>staff</b> <b>was</b> generally in agreement with the standard practice of using coal-fired boilers for two-thirds of the power plant, with the remainder being oil-fired boilers. Coal-fired boilers were preferred because the coal, stored in the sides of the ship, provided additional protection, particularly for the battlecruisers, which carried less armor than their battleship counterparts. The finalized design was approved on 23 May 1914.|$|E
