5|$|Soon after Chandler took office, {{it became}} clear that he could not fund the social {{programs}} initiated by Clements and Wetherby, plus Chandler's own proposed programs, with the revenue presently being brought into the state treasury. He cut the popular Youth Authority, initiated by Wetherby to unify the state's children's welfare programs, but the savings were not enough to balance the budget. In order to deliver on his campaign promises, Chandler ignored the budget during the regular legislative session in 1956, then called a special session during which he presented his budget proposal. The proposal called for spending in excess of $46million more than officials estimated would be brought into the state's coffers over the two-year budget. Chandler convinced legislators to pass the budget, promising to propose a tax plan to pay for the expenditures in a subsequent special session. The promised package added 150,000 citizens to the state's tax rolls, put a <b>surtax</b> on income taxes, and cut tax credits. It created a new 5 percent production tax on whisky, and added taxes to deeds and life insurance premiums. It increased the state gasoline tax for trucks by two cents per gallon and raised corporate taxes by half a percent. In addition, it transferred the assessment and collection of taxes on certain intangibles from local to state government. The plan also called for a $100million bond issue, allowing the allocation of generous budgets for state universities and colleges and improvements to the state highway system.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} Regions and Municipalities in Italy have been {{assigned}} the power to apply local <b>surtaxes</b> on the personal income tax levied at national level. The aim {{of this paper is}} twofold. First, from a positive perspective, we measure the redistributive effects produced by the adoption of these local <b>surtaxes.</b> By using a sample of tax returns representative on a regional basis, we find that the redistributive effects are slightly enhanced by the introduction of local <b>surtaxes</b> {{as a result of an}} increase in tax incidence, given that the introduction of local <b>surtaxes</b> is not offset by a corresponding reduction of national taxation, and a relatively smaller reduction in tax progressivity. Vertical redistribution and horizontal inequity are also distinctly considered. It turns out that at both national and regional level local <b>surtaxes</b> slightly increase these two components, roughly in the same proportion, whereas variations are relatively differentiated at the regional level. Secondly, from a normative perspective, we design a possible welfare-improving tax reform in which the simplification of the personal income tax is combined with its partial decentralization. When the redistributive impact of this reform is assessed, the new tax structure welfare-dominates the current centralized tax both at the national level and within any single Region. decentralizaton, personal income tax, redistributive effects...|$|R

This leads to a distrust in government; South Florida, particularly Miami, which would likely wax more Democratically, often has lowest voter turnout in the state. Specifically, the public felt deceived when the majority of promises were broken related to the county-wide half penny sales <b>surtax,</b> {{which was supposed to}} fund many rapid transit expansions, that was passed in 2002 with about two-thirds of the vote. While many beneficial investments were made {{as a result of the}} tax, transit officials candidly admit that the core promise of new Metrorail lines was always an overstatement. It should be noted, however, that the half-penny itself was a trade off from the full penny <b>surtax</b> that would have generated billions of dollars over several decades, which was championed by then-Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas, but fought successfully by local businessman and community activist Norman Braman.|$|E

25|$|Federal {{tax policy}} was highly {{contentious}} during the war, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt battling a conservative Congress. However, both sides {{agreed on the}} need for high taxes (along with heavy borrowing) to pay for the war: top marginal tax rates ranged from 81%-94% {{for the duration of the}} war, and the income level subject to the highest rate was lowered from $5,000,000 to $200,000. Roosevelt tried unsuccessfully, by executive order 9250, to impose a 100% <b>surtax</b> on after-tax incomes over $25,000 (equal to roughly $ today). However, Roosevelt did manage to impose this cap on executive pay in corporations with government contracts. Congress also enlarged the tax base by lowering the minimum income to pay taxes, and by reducing personal exemptions and deductions. By 1944 nearly every employed person was paying federal income taxes (compared to 10% in 1940).|$|E

25|$|Mandates set in {{the wake}} of the AFLNFL merger in 1970 {{required}} that all teams reside in stadiums with at least 50,000 seats. None of the four stadiums the Patriots had used up to that point qualified, and because Boston is one of the oldest and most densely built cities in North America, there was little room in Boston for a new stadium. Rumors began to spread about a possible relocation to Tampa, Florida; these rumors ultimately never came to fruition (Tampa eventually got the Buccaneers instead). In 1971 the Patriots moved into a hastily and inexpensively constructed stadium in suburban Foxborough (also known as Foxboro), on land granted by the Bay State Raceway. The team was renamed the New England Patriots in March 1971, to reflect its new location roughly halfway between Providence and Boston as well as a desire to better position itself as New England's regional NFL team (this would influence the name of the New England Whalers hockey team when they began play in 1972, like the Patriots, labeling themselves a New England team). The original choice, Bay State Patriots, was rejected by the NFL. The stadium, to be known as Schaefer Stadium, was built at a cost of about $7.1 million in only 325 days. The stadium was one of the first stadiums in the country to be named after a corporate sponsor, as the Schaefer Brewing Company paid $150,000 for naming rights.

In the 1990 s, the tax and transfer system stopped undoing the increases in market income inequality, leading after-tax income inequality to rise. Even so, tax and transfer programs were more redistributive in 2000 than in the 1980 s.

In response to all this, The Miami Herald published a comprehensive exposé titled [...] "Taken For A Ride, How the transit tax went off track", detailing all of the promises that were not kept as well as what money was misspent and how. Despite the service cuts, due to the rise in energy prices and ever-increasing congestion, as well as a significant amount of residential development in the downtown area, ridership continued to grow during the 2000s, averaging well over 60,000 weekday riders throughout 2011. However, this is still short of the 1985 estimate of 75,000 daily riders that were expected {{by the end of that}} year.

The rate of taxation was defined depending on requirements of the state and depending on a financial condition of the tax bearer. The burden of these taxes was not so distressing as sources testify to it. However collection of these taxes has not been carefully prepared by the state and led to growth of debts and numerous displays of social discontent. Possibly, chrysargyron as the tax of the urban population, paid in gold and silver has been entered as early as 305 / 306, and the basic features has received in reign of emperor Constantius II.
