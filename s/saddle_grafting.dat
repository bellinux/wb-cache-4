40|$|Abstract: Two field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} on jackfruit plants (Artocarpus heterophyllus lam.) under Giza governorate conditions during 2004 / 2005 and 2005 / 2006 seasons and took some observations until 2007 year. The first one aimed to the seedlings production {{to use as a}} rootstock or an selected trees in the future for further evaluations, the seedlings produced by using either the intact seeds or the decoated seeds (without outer leathery coat) treated by some chemical treatments (GA 3 at 0. 5 ppm for 12 hrs. or 10 ppm for 10 minutes and kinetin at 10 ppm for 6 hrs. or 100 ppm for 5 minutes); and some physical treatments (soaking in the tap water for 12 or 24 hrs, growing under the shade of mango, red cellophane sheets and the sunlight (control)), as an individual or mixed treatments. The second experiment aimed to the possibility of using the top-cleft and <b>saddle</b> <b>grafting</b> methods to benefit of the characters of the grafting in propagating the jackfruit, the apical growth of the current shoots of the old trees in Egypt that native to "kapa " jackfruit or the apical growth of the seedlings produced in this trial used as a sources of the scions, make the girdling under the graft union and covering the scion and the graft union with transparent or black polyethylene bags or without cover. Also, the histological study have done on the graft union region to detect the anatomical reasons of the compatibility or incompatibility between the scion and the rootstock and correlated with the morphological results. The results revealed that the differences between th...|$|E
40|$|The apple {{rootstock}} ‘Geneva® 41 ’ (‘G. 41 ’), {{is desirable}} for its {{resistance to fire}} blight, Erwinia amylovora, while producing high yields. However, ‘G. 41 ’ and other Geneva® selections tend to form weak graft unions in the nursery that are susceptible to breaking in the wind, at harvest, or during shipment. In order to understand and remedy this graft union weakness, six scions (‘Fuji’, ‘Gala’, ‘Honeycrisp’, ‘McIntosh’, ‘Pink Lady’, and ‘Scilate’) by seven rootstocks (‘G. 41 ’, ‘G. 935 ’, ‘G. 214 ’, ‘G. 11 ’, ‘M. 9 -NIC 29 ’, ‘B. 9 ’ and ‘EMLA 26 ’), by two grafting methods (chip bud and saddle graft) in a factorial design were tested for graft union flexural strength and flexibility. Additionally, plant growth regulators (PGR) were applied to trees with ‘G. 41 ’ as rootstock {{as a solution to}} overcome graft union weakness. Transpiration rate and hydraulic resistance were measured for comparison of a weak graft forming rootstock (‘G. 41 ’) to a strong graft forming rootstock (‘M. 9 -NIC 29 ’). ‘G. 41 ’ consistently formed a weaker graft union regardless of scion or grafting method. Scions such as ‘McIntosh’ and ‘Pink Lady’ formed stronger graft unions, while ‘Scilate’ and ‘Honeycrisp’ form weaker graft unions. <b>Saddle</b> <b>grafting</b> did not improve graft union strength. Nurseries that graft on ‘G. 41 ’ should choose scions that form stronger graft unions. Benzyl adenine (BA) in a latex paint increased the strength and flexibility of the graft union relative to scion cross sectional area (SCSA), but further research is needs to identify more efficient methods of application. Rootstock effect on transpiration rate was different between years. No detectable differences were found for hydraulic resistance through the graft union of different rootstocks, suggesting weaker graft unions did not limit hydraulic conductance or transpiration rate. Thus graft union weakness is not an indicator of poor vascular connection...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo do trabalho foi avaliar duas modalidades de enxertia para a cultura do maracujazeiro nas condições da Depressão Cuiabana. O ensaio foi realizado no viveiro da Fazenda Experimental da Faculdade de Agronomia e Medicina Veterinária - FAMEV, da Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso, localizada no município de Santo Antônio do Leverger. Foram utilizadas modalidades de enxertia do tipo garfagem em fenda cheia e fenda lateral, em três pontos distintos dos porta-enxertos: acima da inserção das primeiras folhas ou enxertia de topo, acima de três folhas e acima de cinco folhas. As mudas utilizadas como porta-enxerto foram obtidas através de sementes oriundas do IAC (Instituto Agronômico de Campinas - SP) da {{cultivar}} IAC 275 e do acesso Roxinho-miúdo. Os garfos usados como enxertos foram retirados de plantas jovens da cultivar IAC 275, com três meses de idade e diâmetro de 0, 5 cm. A percentagem de pegamento da enxertia e o desenvolvimento de plantas foram superiores pelo método de garfagem em fenda cheia, sendo também maiores em porta-enxertos com cinco folhas, em relação aos de três e aos sem folhas. A garfagem em fenda cheia mostrou-se mais adequada, uma vez que, com essa modalidade, obtiveram-se 98 % de pegamento.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical and histological outcomes of implant placed after socket preservation procedures in the esthetic zone. Implant survival rate and biological complications were recorded during a follow-up period of 1 year. Materials and methods: A series of 12 patients needing the replacement of a single tooth in the esthetic zone were included in the present study. The hopeless teeth were extracted atraumatically, the sockets were filled with bovine hydroxyapatite (0. 25 - 1 mm particles) and the sites were covered with a <b>saddled</b> connective tissue <b>graft.</b> After a healing period of 3 months, biopsies were retrieved in the socket preservation sites and implants were placed. The patients were followed for a period of 1 year. Results: The etiologies of tooth loss were : endodontic (9), caries (1), periodontal (1), and traumatic (1). A total of 12 implants (10 incisors, 2 premolars) were placed on 12 patients (6 men / 6 women) aged from 24 to 61 (42, 3 – 11, 91). All implant reached an adequate primary stability (> 20 N/cm 2). 7 out of 12 implants were immediately restored with a temporary crown, and the définitive restorations were successfully placed in all cases. After a follow-up period of 1 year, all implants fulfilled strict success criteria for dental implants with regard to osteointegration, including the absence of peri-implant radiolucency, implant mobility, suppuration, and pain and no further complications occurred. Out of 12 sites only 7 biopsies were retrieved for histological analyses. New bone was found in the apical third of the socket in every specimen, in the mid-third in only 3 specimen and no bone was found in any of the spécimen in the more cervical third of the socket. Conclusion: The results from this prospective case series suggest that early implant placement in extraction socket site seems to display good clinical outcomes despite the incomplete bone regeneration in the socket at 3 months.

40|$|AIMS: Multiple {{surgical}} protocols using biomaterials {{have been}} proposed to limit the typical post-extraction bone resorption. However, because of the heterogeneity of the studies, particularly the differences in assessment methods, {{it is difficult to}} determine the superiority of one technique over another. The objective of this study was to describe a new radiographic method to draw a map of alveolar bone remodelling after alveolar ridge preservation procedures to compare different surgical techniques more accurately. The newly developed measuring method was applied to a case series describing a specific preservation technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen extraction sites (in 14 patients) located in the upper anterior maxilla were treated with bovine hydroxyapatite (0. 25 - to 1 -mm particles) and a <b>saddled</b> connective tissue <b>graft.</b> A radiographic three-dimensional assessment of the hard tissues was performed at baseline and 3 months after the procedure. Standardized horizontal measurements were taken at three corono-apical levels (- 2, - 5 and - 9 mm) and at three mesio-distal levels (mesial, centre and distal) in the buccal and palatal aspects. Vertical measurements were also recorded in nine regions superior to the alveolar crest. The measurements were performed by two independent observers and intra- and inter-observer effects were evaluated. RESULTS: No inter- and intra-observer effects were found when analysing the measurements from these two observers. The horizontal dimension of the crest decreased by 1. 6 mm (20 %) in the cervical regions (- 2 mm level), decreased moderately, by 1 mm (12 %), at the - 5 mm level and decreased very little, 0. 5 mm (6 %), at the apical (- 8 mm) level. The losses were always significantly higher in the buccal than in the palatal aspect. Buccally, the maximal bone remodelling at the cervical level remained below 1 mm. Vertical bone resorption was homogeneous and< 1 mm in the nine measured regions. DISCUSSION: The radiographic measuring methodology proved to be reproducible. It can be applied in other clinical settings. It successfully assessed the alveolar ridge preservation technique (BHA+saddle connective tissue graft). Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{aesthetic}} {{results of}} implant restoration in the anterior maxilla are particularly {{related to the}} soft tissue profile. Although socket preservation techniques appear to reduce bone remodelling after tooth extraction, there is still few investigations assessing the external soft tissue profile after such procedures. The goal {{of the present study}} was to describe an accurate technique to evaluate soft tissue contour changes after performing socket preservation procedures. The secondary objective was to apply the newly develop measuring method to a specific socket preservation using a “saddled” connective tissue graft combined with the insertion of slowly resorbable biomaterials into the socket. Materials and Methods: A total of 14 patients needing tooth replacement in the aesthetic region were included to receive a socket preservation procedure using a connective tissue graft. Impressions were taken before the tooth extraction (baseline) and at 2, 4, and 12 weeks after the procedure. The corresponding plaster casts were scanned, and the evolution of the soft tissue profile in relation to the baseline situation was assessed using imaging software. Results: The measuring technique allowed assessing the soft tissue profiles accurately at different level of the alveolar process. The insertion of a saddled connective tissue appeared to compensate significantly for the horizontal and vertical bone remodelling after a socket preservation procedure in most regions of the alveolar crest. After 12 weeks, the only significant change was located in the more cervical and central region of the alveolar process and reached a mean of 0. 76 mm. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, we found that a <b>saddled</b> connective tissue <b>graft</b> combined with a socket preservation procedure could almost completely counteract the bone remodelling in terms of the external soft tissue profile. The minor changes found in the cervical region might disappear with the emergence profile of the prosthodontic components. The described technique might therefore enhance the aesthetic outcomes when a tooth has to be replaced in the aesthetic zone. The described protocol can be used to further compare the effectiveness of different extraction socket preservation protocols in randomised controlled trials. Peer reviewed 10. 1111 /clr. 1214...|$|R
40|$|Background: The bone {{remodeling}} after {{tooth extraction}} {{can result in}} the loss of as much as 50 % of the buccal wall and a global crestal reduction in width of 3. 87 mm according to a recent systematic review. Multiple surgical protocols using biomaterials are proposed in order to limit the typical postextraction bone resorption. However, because of the heterogeneity of the studies and, more specifically, of the assessment methods, it is difficult to assert the superiority of one technique over another. Aim: The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a new radiographic method to assess alveolar bone remodeling after socket preservation procedures. Methods: Sixteen extraction sites (in 14 patients) localized in the upper anterior maxilla were treated with bovine hydroxyapatite (0. 25 – 1 mm particles) and a <b>saddled</b> connective tissue <b>graft.</b> A radiographic 3 -dimensional assessment of the hard tissues was performed at baseline and at 3 months after the procedure. Standardized horizontal measurements were taken at three corono apical levels (	 2, 	 5, and 	 9 mm) and at three mesio-diatal level (Mesial, Center, and Distal) in the buccal and palatal aspects. Vertical measurements were also recorded in nine regions over the top of the alveolar crest. Results: Extraction socket-preservation technique assessed in the present study significantly reduced horizontal bone remodeling. The horizontal dimension of the crest decreased by 1. 6 mm (20 %) in the cervical regions (	 2 mm level), experienced a moderate decrease of 1 mm (12 %) at the 	 5 mm level, and experienced a very low decrease of 0. 5 mm(6 %) in the apical (	 8 mm) level. The losses were always significantly higher in the buccal than in the palatal aspect. Buccally, the maximal bone remodeling at the cervical level remained below 1 mm. Vertical bone resorption was homogeneous and was < 1 mm in the nine measured regions. Conclusions and clinical implications: The radiographic measuring methodology proved to be accurate and reproducible. It can be applied in other clinical settings. Moreover, the surgical procedure evaluated in the present study, significantly limits the postextraction buccal bone remodeling compared with the data found in the literature for untreated extraction socket in the aesthetic area. However, a complete inhibition of the bone remodeling was not reached and the authors suggest a surgical technique using a ‘‘saddled’’ connective tissue graft to thicken buccal soft tissue biotype and consequently compensate for cervical bone loss.
