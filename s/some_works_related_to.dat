40|$|Abstract. Data {{compression}} {{has been}} widely applied in many data pro-cessing areas. Compression methods use variable-length codes with the shorter codes assigned to symbols or groups of symbols that appear in the data frequently. Fibonacci code, {{as a representative of}} these codes, is often utilized for the compression of small numbers. Time consump-tion of encoding as well as decoding algorithms is important for some applications in the data processing area. In this case, efficiency of these algorithms is extremely important. There are <b>some</b> <b>works</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the fast decoding of variable-length codes. In this paper, we introduce the Fast Fibonacci encoding algorithm; our approach is up-to 4. 6 × more efficient than the conventional bit-oriented algorithm. ...|$|E

40|$|Many data in {{applications}} exhibit nonlinear {{features such}} as nonlinearity between lagged variables and heteroscedas-ticity. They require nonlinear models to describe the data. Parametric nonlinear time series models provide powerful tools for analyzing nonlinear time series data when the models are correctly specified, thus the choice {{for the form of}} a parametric model is very critical. A natural alternative is to use nonparametric methods. One of the interesting nonparametric models to fit nonlinear time series is the well known functional coefficient regression (FCR) model. There are in literature <b>some</b> <b>works</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> this model, with different approaches of estimation (e. g., kernel esti-mation, spline estimation). A very common supposition of the model is related to the errors, where they are natural to be supposed independent. In this work we will study the estimation of FCR model by splines, with dependent errors. The comparison of the rate of convergence between the models with correlated and independent errors will be done. Moreover, a real application will illustrate the method by fitting a model and performing forecasts. We will compare our results with others used in literature...|$|E
40|$|A presente pesquisa visa acompanhar os efeitos de uma oficina de música sobre um grupo de crianças com transtornos de desenvolvimento. O objetivo foi o de estabelecer algumas hipóteses sobre a compreensão que a atenção à dimensão da musicalidade pode fornecer sobre esses casos, bem como que tipo de contribuição é capaz de proporcionar em termos de tratamento. Diversas pesquisas constataram que há, na primeira infância, uma relação do bebê com o outro, cuidador, da qual é possível depreender certas qualidades musicais. Além disso, pela via da psicanálise, é desenvolvida a tese de que a voz e a música podem ser abordadas como uma porta de entrada para a relação arcaica entre o sujeito e o Outro, em especial através da noção de pulsão invocante termo cunhado por Jacques Lacan, mas aprofundado principalmente por autores posteriores. A leitura de alguns trabalhos em torno dessa questão conduziu a uma consideração sobre a importância da musicalidade da voz, bem como da sincronia {{temporal}} na relação entre o infans e o outro, para a constituição do sujeito. Apesar da potência invocadora da música, o circuito da pulsão invocante não se completa enquanto a dimensão diacrônica e a alternância entre presença/ausência não engendrarem a falta cujo destino na constituição do sujeito for o do recalque originário. O que coloca a questão de se, em primeiro lugar, em casos de psicose e autismo, a sensibilidade à musicalidade está preservada e, em segundo lugar, se uma intervenção terapêutica pela via da música produziria efeitos positivos na qualidade do laço social estabelecido por essas crianças. Os resultados obtidos na pesquisa alinham-se com os de outras pesquisas que mostram que a sensibilidade ao manhês e à musicalidade está preservada em casos de autismo. Os efeitos que a dimensão de surpresa envolvida na música produz em diferentes crianças apresentaram uma aproximação possível com as hipóteses diagnósticas e com a orientação da intervenção no tratamento desses casos. Por fim, pareceu-nos que a atenção à dimensão musical, seja presente na fala ou nos movimentos, é profícua para o trabalho com crianças com distúrbios de desenvolvimento como o autismo e a psicose, seja num enquadre institucional em grupo ou nãoThe present dissertation aims {{to verify}} {{the effects of a}} music workshop on a group of children with developmental disorders. The goal was to establish some hypotheses related to what an attention to the dimension of musicality may provide in terms of understanding to these cases, as well as the kind of contribution it may offer in terms of treatment. Several researches have established that there is, in early childhood, a relationship of the infans with the caring other from which it is possible to infer musical qualities. Furthermore, through psychoanalytical theory, we develop the thesis that voice and music may represent a doorway to the archaic relationship between the subject and the Other, specially through the notion of invocative drive a term coined by Jacques Lacan, but which was further developed by subsequent authors. The reading of <b>some</b> <b>works</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> this issue has lead to a reflection on the importance of the musicality of voice, as well as the temporal synchrony present in the relationship between infans and other, to the subjects constitution. Despite the invocative power of music, the circuit of the invocative drive cannot complete itself as long as the diachronic dimension and the alternating cycle of presence/absence produce the lack that is, in the constitution of the subject, destined for the original repression. Which raises the question, first of all, if the sensibility to music is preserved in cases of autism and child psychosis and, secondly, if a therapeutic intervention based on music would produce any positive effects in the quality of the social bonds established by these children. The results obtained line up with other researches which show that the sensibility to the motherese and musicality is preserved in cases of autism. Also, the effects that the surprise inherent to music have on different children present us with a possible approach to the diagnostic hypotheses and to the orientation of intervention in the treatment of these cases. Finally, we had indications that the attention to the musical qualities present in speech or movement is fertile in work with children with developmental disorders such as autism and psychosis, whether in an institutional context or no...|$|E

The classical assumption of symmetry of a multivariate covariance function is overlay restrictive and has been considered as unrealistic for most of real data applications.

In particular, there is <b>some</b> <b>work</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> asymmetric covariances on Euclidean spaces, depending on the Euclidean distance. However, for data collected over large portions of planet Earth, the most natural spatial domain is a sphere, with the corresponding geodesic distance being the natural metric.
