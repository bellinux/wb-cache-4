50|$|As benthic fish, dories are {{typically}} found close to or {{directly over the}} sea bottom, but occasionally in midwater as well. Depths frequented are moderate, ca. 50 - 800 metres; muddy substrates are preferred, usually over the continental shelf and slope, near the coast. Some, such as the <b>silvery</b> <b>John</b> <b>dory</b> (Zenopsis conchifera), form small and loose schools; while others, such as the John dory, are generally solitary when not spawning. Dories are poor swimmers; they propel themselves primarily via a balistiform (i.e., like the triggerfishs) mode of locomotion, with the dorsal and anal fins undulating in unison as the main propulsive force and the pectoral fins used for stabilisation and turning.|$|E

40|$|The {{capture of}} four {{specimens}} of <b>Silvery</b> <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> (Zenopsis conchifer),a species {{recorded in the}} Mediterranean Sea {{for the first time}} in 2006, is reported from the Iberian coast (western Mediterranean). One of the specimens was caught near the Strait of Gibraltar and is probably a vagrant. Despite these catches, there is no evidence of a self–sustaining population, so this species should be considered as alien in the Mediterranean...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} abundance and fishing {{potential of the}} commercially valuable fishes and cephalopods with marketable size was assessed using two seasonal bottom trawl surveys performed in 2001 and 2002 on the outer shelf and upper slope (100 - 600 m depth) {{off the coast of}} southern Brazil. These surveys were part of REVIZEE, a national program designed to assess the fishery potential within the Economic Exclusive Zone. Of the 228 fish and cephalopod species caught during the surveys, only 27 species and genera were considered to be of commercial interest. Commercial-sized individuals of these species made up 52. 3 % of the total catch. The total biomass was estimated to be 167, 193 ton (± 22 %) and 165, 460 ton (± 25 %) in the winter-spring and summer-autumn surveys, respectively. The most abundant species were the Argentine short-fin squid Illex argentinas, a species with highly variable recruitment, followed by the Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi, the gulf-hake Urophycis mystacea, and the monkfish Lophius gastrophysus. The latter three were intensively fished prior to the surveys, as well as the beardfish Polymixia lowei and <b>silvery</b> <b>John</b> <b>dory</b> Zenopsis conchifera, both relatively abundant but with a very low market value. The potential yield of the demersal fish species, not considering Illex argentinus, estimated with the Gulland equation for a mean natural mortality of M = 0. 31, was 20, 460 ton. When considering only Merluccius hubbsi, Urophycis mystacea, and Lophius gastrophysus, the potential yield decreased to 6, 625 ton. The surveys showed that the fishery potential of the outer shelf and upper slope was substantially lower than that of the inner shelf. Therefore, this environment should be carefully monitored to avoid overfishing and fast depletion...|$|E

Se evaluó la abundancia relativa y el potencial pesquero de peces y cefalópodos de especies y tamaños de valor comercial en dos muéstreos estacionales con redes de arrastre de fondo realizados en los años 2001 y 2002 sobre la plataforma externa y talud superior, 100 a 600 m de profundidad, a lo largo del extremo sur de la costa brasilera, como parte de un programa nacional de evaluación del potencial pesquero de la Zona Económica Exclusiva (Programa REVIZEE). Del total de 228 especies de peces y cefalópodos capturados, sólo 27 especies y géneros fueron considerados de interés comercial. Los tamaños comercializables de estas especies representaron 52, 3 %) de la captura total. La biomasa total estimada fue de 167. 193 ton (± 22 %>) y 165. 460 ton (± 25 %>) en los muéstreos de invierno-primavera y verano-otoño respectivamente. Las especies más abundantes fueron el calamar argentino Illex argentinus, especie de reclutamiento muy variable, seguido de la merluza argentina Merluccius hubbsi, la brotóla de profundidad Urophycis mystacea, el pez sapo o rapé Lophius gastrophysus, estas últimas intensamente explotadas en la época de los levantamientos, así como también Polymixia lowei y Zenopsis conchifera, ambas relativamente abundantes pero de escaso valor comercial. El rendimiento potencial de especies demersales excluido Illex argentinus, estimado a través de la ecuación de Gulland para un coeficiente de mortalidad natural medio de M = 0, 31, fue de 20. 460 ton. Cuando sólo Merluccius hubbsi, Urophycis mystacea y Lophius gastrophysus fueron considerados, el potencial disminuye a 6. 625 ton. Los mustreos mostraron que el potencial pesquero de la plataforma continental externa y el talud superior es substancialmente inferior al de la plataforma interna, por lo tanto, este ambiente debe ser cuidadosamente controlado para evitar la sobrepesca y rápida depleción...|$|E
