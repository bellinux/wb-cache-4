500|$|Reports {{arose in}} the media that the ticket sales for the tour were falling, leading Arthur Fogel, Chairman of Live Nation's Global Touring division, to brand them as [...] "ridiculous". He {{clarified}} to Billboard that the about 80% of the tickets were sold in North America and Europe, and {{they were still in}} the process of releasing future dates for numerous venues. The 29 shows in North America had grossed around US $26 million, with an average of almost $900,000 per show. Fogel also addressed concerns that Live Nation had lost $30 million from Gaga's tour, saying that if a similar situation really happened, then the company would have cancelled the concerts. [...] "I just don't know how this shit gets any traction without people doing their homework... Just a complete fool would <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> and it could only come from somebody who has an agenda, because it makes absolutely no sense, on any level", Fogel concluded. A total of 800,000 tickets have been sold for the tour, as reported by Billboard.|$|E

Because they knew perfectly well, that that is where you draw the wagons around." [...] Larry King, who is Jewish, replied, [...] "When you say—when you <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> you are playing right in, though, to anti-Semitic people who say the Jews are—" [...] Brando interrupted: [...] "No, no, because I will be the first one who will appraise the Jews honestly and say 'Thank God for the Jews'." ...|$|E

Mladen Markac’s defense counsel cited this {{as an example of}} gross exaggerations of Serb casualties by the UN personnel in the field. Canadian general Alain Forand didn’t want to comment on Leslie’s claim, <b>saying</b> only <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> was never registered in the situation reports drafted by the Sector South command.|$|R

There is a way of saying 'Henry!' which conveys surprised admiration and remorseful devotion; but she had not said it in that way. There had been a note of horror in her voice. Henry's was a simple mind, and the obvious solution, that Minnie thought that he had drunk too much red wine at the Italian restaurant, did not occur to him.|$|E

And if everything had gone right he might have got afloat again. But it seems as if he can't touch anything without it turning to mud. On the very day before the fight was to come off, the poor mutt who was going against the champion goes and lets a sparring-partner of his own knock him down and fool around with him. With all the newspaper men there too! You probably saw about it in the papers. It made a great story for them. Well, that killed the whole thing. The public had never been any too sure that this fellow Bugs Butler had a chance of putting up a scrap with the champion that would be worth paying to see; and, when they read that he couldn't even stop his sparring-partners slamming him all around the place they simply decided to stay away. Poor old Fill! It was a finisher for him. The house wasn't a quarter full, and after he'd paid these two pluguglies their guarantees, which they insisted on having before they'd so much as go into the ring, he was just about cleaned out. So there you are!" ...|$|R

Record executive Danny Goldberg, who {{was a friend of}} Love and Cobain's, defended her against the claims, and commented on her decision to be profiled in the piece: [...] "Courtney had this yearning for mass-culture acceptability and just couldn't <b>say</b> no to <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I had a sense of foreboding about it, but I had no idea it as gonna be as bad as it was. [...] done a lot of stupid, self-destructive things, but I don't believe she screwed around with her pregnancy. Those allegations were anonymous." [...] Love would later claim that the publication of the article had serious implications for her marriage as well as Cobain's mental state, suggesting it was a factor in his suicide.|$|R

60|$|The {{discourse}} of Dylks {{the second night}} was a chain of biblical passages, {{as it had been}} the first night. But an apparent intention, which had been wanting before, ran through the incoherent texts, leaping as it were from one to another, and there binding them in an intimation of a divine mission. He did not say that he had been sent of God, but he made the texts which he gave, swiftly and unerringly, <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> for him to such as were prepared to believe it.

40|$|Never having met a green dog before, {{we would}} {{probably}} still <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> "Look at <b>that</b> green dog " if we met one today. This example of novel behavior comes about through a new combination of the well-learned words, "green " and "dog, " {{in the face of}} the novel combination of color and species. Such novel combinations are a commonplace feature of human language. Chomsky (1959) made much of the creation of novel utterances, calling it productivity. His account has been a long-standing challenge to the analysis of behavior, because he has maintained that behavior analytic accounts have little if anything to say about such novelty and its sources. Behavior analysis provides an account of the origins of behavior in terms of the selection of behavior within the lifetime of the individual organism (Skinner, 1981). That type of selection, ontogenic or operant selection, is in many ways analogous to phylogenic selection, the selection of populations of organisms over evolutionary time. Selection depends on the availability o...|$|R
60|$|A {{method of}} proof which, when used as directed, gives {{sometimes}} truth and sometimes falsehood--as the method of simple enumeration does--is obviously not a valid method, for validity demands invariable truth. Thus, if simple enumeration is to be rendered valid, it must not be stated as Mill states it. We shall have to say, at most, that the data render the result probable. Causation holds, we shall say, in every instance {{we have been able}} to test; therefore it probably holds in untested instances. There are terrible difficulties in the notion of probability, but we may ignore them at present. We thus have what at least may be a logical principle, since it is without exception. If a proposition is true in every instance that we happen to know of, and if the instances are very numerous, then, we shall say, it becomes very probable, on the data, that it will be true in any further instance. This is not refuted by the fact that what we declare to be probable does not always happen, for an event may be probable on the data and yet not occur. It is, however, obviously capable of further analysis, and of more exact statement. We shall have to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this: <b>that</b> every instance of a proposition[10] being true increases the probability of its being true in a fresh instance, and that a sufficient number of favourable instances will, in the absence of instances to the contrary, make the probability of the truth of a fresh instance approach indefinitely near to certainty. Some such principle as this is required if the method of simple enumeration is to be valid.|$|R
50|$|Owing to {{the nature}} of the case, and {{considering}} the isolation of Ireland, it is extremely difficult, or rather impossible, to procure independent foreign testimony, to the truth of Irish annals. But, although such testimony is denied us, yet there happily exists another kind of evidence to which we may appeal with comparative confidence. This is nothing less than the records of natural phenomena reported in the annals, for if it can be shown by calculating backwards, as modern science has enabled us to do, that such natural phenomena as the appearance of comets or the occurrence of eclipses are recorded to the day and hour by the annalists, then we can also <b>say</b> with <b>something</b> <b>like</b> certainty <b>that</b> these phenomena were recorded at their appearance by writers who personally observed them, and whose writings must have been actually consulted and seen by these later annalists whose books we now possess. If we take, let us say, the Annals of Ulster, which treat of Ireland and Irish history from about the year 444, but of which the written copy dates only from the 15th century, we see from the years 496 to 884 as many as eighteen records of eclipses and comets, and all these agree exactly with modern astronomy. How impossible it is to keep such records unless written memoranda are made at the time by eyewitnesses is shown by the fact that Bede, born in 675, in recording the great solar eclipse that took place only eleven years before his own birth, is yet two days astray in his date; while on the other hand the Annals of Ulster give, not only the correct day, but the correct hour, thus showing that their compiler, Cathal Maguire, had access either to the original, or a copy of an original, account by an eyewitness. Whenever any side-lights have been thrown from an external quarter on the Irish annals, either from Cymric, Saxon, or Continental sources, they have always tended to show their accuracy. We may take it then without any credulity on our part, that Irish history as recorded in the annals may be pretty well relied upon from the 4th century onward.|$|R
