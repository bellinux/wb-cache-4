This classification procedure yielded eight different particle types. Differences in particle type abundances for the microlayer and bulk water were observed. They were apportioned to their most probable sources. The results were compared with atmospheric and riverine particle data. The domination of the major particle groups (aluminosilicates, Ca-rich aluminosilicates, CaCO 3, silicates, and organic particulate matter) suppresses the relative abundances of the metal-rich particles (Fe-rich, Ti-rich, and others).

Virtually all of the sedimentary 3 He (> 99. 98 %) is of extraterrestrial origin. The total helium in the sediments can be explained as a binary mixture of terrestrial and extraterrestrial components. We calculate an average 3 He/ 4 He ratio for the extraterrestrial endmember of 2. 41 ± 0. 29 * 10 **- 4, which is, remarkably, equal to that measured in present-day interplanetary dust particles. We determine a constant extraterrestrial 3 He flux of 5. 9 ± 0. 9 * 10 **- 13 cm** 3 STP/cm** 2 / ka for our 800 -ka Paleocene record at ~ 58 Ma.

40|$|AbstractAccording to a {{range of}} assessments, there exists a large {{cost-effective}} potential to increase energy efficiency in shipping through reduced speed at sea enabled by shorter time in port. This means that the energy needed can be reduced whilst maintaining the same transport service. However, the fact that a large cost-effective potential has been identified that is not being harnessed by decision-makers in practice suggests that there is more to this potential to understand. In this paper, the possibilities for increasing energy efficiency by reducing waiting time in port are explored and problematised through a case study of a short <b>sea</b> <b>bulk</b> shipping company transporting dry bulk goods mainly in the North and Baltic seas. Operational data from two ships in the company’s fleet for one year showed that the ships spent more than 40 % of their time in ports and that half of the time in port was not productive. The two most important reasons for the large share of unproductive time were that ports were closed on nights and weekends and that ships arrived too early before the stevedores were ready to load or unload the cargo. Reducing all of the unproductive time may be difficult, but the results also show that even a conservative estimate of one to four hours of reduced time per port call would lead to a reduction in energy use of 2 – 8 %. From in-depth interviews with employees of the shipping company, ports and ship agencies, a complex picture is painted when attempting to understand how this potential arises. Aspects such as a lack of effective ship-shore-port communication, little time for ship operators, an absence of means for accurately predicting energy use of voyages as a function of speed, perceived risk of arriving too late, and relationships with third-party technical management may all play a role...|$|R
40|$|The main route {{discussed}} for mitigating CO 2 {{emissions from}} shipping is through increased energy efficiency. Many operational measures that cost-efficiently decrease the energy consumption for shipping companies are available; however, assessments {{indicate that they}} have not been fully implemented. Speed reduction due to improved port efficiency has previously been highlighted as a measure with high potential for increased energy efficiency at a low investment cost. The purpose of this report is to investigate the possibilities to reduce speed at sea when the turnaround time in port is decreased and how this affects the total energy consumption. The research is based on a case study of one short <b>sea</b> <b>bulk</b> shipping company operating in Northern Europe. Quantitative analyses of voyage reports, vessels’ energy consumption curves and Statement of Facts (SoF) for two shipping services were combined with information gained from interviews with onshore managers and operators at the shipping company, ship crew members and managers in ports. The largest sources of unproductive time in port that could be minimized to improve turnaround time are waiting time due to the ports’ hours of operation, as well as waiting time at berth before loading and discharging due to early arrival. Scenarios have been developed from quantitative and qualitative data in the study that result in 1 to 4 hours of decreased time per port call. With a corresponding speed reduction at sea, the potential for improvement in energy efficiency is 1 - 5 %. This is substantially lower than other assessments found in the literature, but is still impressive. The low investment costs could be confirmed qualitatively, but the transaction costs involved for communication and monitoring between stakeholders could contribute to the slow implementation of this measure...|$|R

The fluorine concentration in the amorphous biogenic component is 15 ppm. 300 to 800 ppm of fluorine were measured in the clay fractions, 330 to 920 ppm in their lithogenic components. Biogenic opal causes a decrease in fluorine concentration of the sediment by a considerable amount: 6 to 56 % relative to the clay fraction, due to the proportions involved. Biogenic opal is therefore taken into account as a 'diluting' factor for the fluorine budget in marine sediments...|$|R

Fjord systems are characterized by freshwater runoff and riverine input and based on δ 18 O data, we show that > 30 % of the surface water originated from periodic river input during ice growth. This resulted in fresher sea-ice layers with higher gas content than is typical from marine <b>sea</b> ice.

There is depletion of Mg compared to Na in the coastal part of the traverse, but the <b>bulk</b> <b>sea</b> water ratio is maintained further inland. Evidence for Cl− fractionation is less clear, with a depletion in some sections and an enrichment in others compared to Na.

Non sea-salt sulphate followed a similar trend to 45 km, but the subsequent decrease in concentration was less rapid, suggesting a greater residence time for sulphate derived from marine biogenic activity than for sea-salt aerosol.
