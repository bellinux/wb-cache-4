40|$|Clinical fatal {{examination}} requires {{thorough and}} continuous monitoring. Obstetricians {{are required to}} check fatal monitoring signals for anomalies. Manual processing of ultrasonic data is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To overcome this problem, a fatal status monitoring system was designed to help obstetricians detect non-reassuring fatal status. In the proposed system, the weighted average is employed to estimate the fatal heartbeat baseline and uterine contraction baseline. These baseline values allow five patterns to be recognized including heartbeat acceleration, heartbeat deceleration, uterine contraction, heartbeat noise pattern, and uterine noise pattern. Moreover, the monitoring system considers four non-reassuring fatal <b>status</b> <b>types.</b> Fuzzy logic is {{used to analyze the}} signals for each non-reassuring <b>status</b> <b>type.</b> A total of 23 fuzzy rules are used to recognize non-reassuring fatal status that triggers an alarm mechanism. Non-reassuring conditions are detected and alarm signals are sent to obstetricians for immediate treatment of the patient. The fuzzy sets can be modified and adopted to fit the requirements of individual patients. A signal simulator is used to verify the applicability of the system...|$|R
