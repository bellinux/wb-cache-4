Although temporary, it remains an effective working definition until a more permanent one is formally adopted. It {{does not address the}} dispute over the lower mass limit, and so it <b>steered</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> the controversy regarding objects within the Solar System. This definition also makes no comment on the planetary status of objects orbiting brown dwarfs, such as 2M1207b.|$|E
5|$|The major {{legitimate}} businesses on the island, such as {{banking and}} hotels, {{were able to}} thrive {{in large part because}} of the illegal activities. Though many of these business leaders <b>steered</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> direct involvement in the business affairs of the Maceos and the gangs, their relationships were hardly antagonistic. Some, such as financier, hotelier, and insurance executive William Lewis Moody, Jr., actually welcomed illegal gambling because it brought tourists who filled up his hotels. He was even known to make loans to the Maceos' syndicate.|$|E
5|$|Unmanned {{boats were}} the first vessels to enter the lagoon. Onboard {{instruments}} allowed remote-controlled radiation measurements to be made. When support ships entered the lagoon for evaluation, decontamination, and salvage activities, they <b>steered</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> lagoon water hot spots detected by the drone boats. The standard for radiation exposure to personnel {{was the same as}} that used by the Manhattan Project: 0.1 roentgens per day. Because of this constraint, only the five most distant target ships could be boarded on the first day. The closer-in ships were hosed down by Navy fireboats using saltwater and flame retardants. The first hosing reduced radioactivity by half, but subsequent hosings were ineffective. For most of the ships, reboarding had to wait until the short-lived radioisotopes decayed; ten days elapsed before the last of the targets could be boarded.|$|E

5|$|On 9 September, Suwito {{informed}} a British diplomat {{that the}} Strait would be closed for naval exercises {{and that it}} would be appreciated if British warships <b>steered</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> the area in the interim. To Britain, this seemed an escalation of the Crisis, as if the task force sailed through they might have to fight the Indonesian Navy directly, though in fact Indonesia was lessening its resolve to refuse the task force passage through the Strait, and hoped to keep the British from attempting to force their way through via more indirect means. This was not the way the British interpreted it, however, and the announcement triggered a new round of debates over the forced passage. Thorneycroft reviewed the plan with the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence, and the Commonwealth Relations Office, most of whom told him to consider the opinions of the commanders on site. After remembering the influential Lord Head's endorsement of Begg's views, Thorneycroft was swayed, and decided that the two destroyers should proceed through the Strait without the Victorious, using the aircraft of that vessel and the Centaur for cover. Though worried about the psychological effect of the non-passage of the carrier, he was reminded that Britain had not informed Jakarta that the ship would return that way in the first place.|$|E

So we <b>steered</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> B in the early going, and once the new show was established, there was really no need to harken back to the old one.|$|E

25|$|Rodezno was acutely {{sensitive}} to threat of revolution and convinced that democracy could not contain it; he responded warmly to authoritarian nationalism, covering {{in his opinion}} a broad spectrum from fascist Benito Mussolini's regime to Ramsay MacDonald’s National Government. Hostile especially to militant republican secularism and agrarian reform, he remained vehement opponent in the parliament and was once hit by a flying glass in return. Touring the country he boasted that “Carlist shock troops are ready to defend society against Marxist threat”. However, he was not among those pressing an insurgent strategy.
