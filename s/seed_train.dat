50|$|The idea {{of special}} trains to promote better {{agricultural}} practices {{was developed in}} Canada {{in the early years}} of the 20th century. In 1904, special trains brought farmers to the Dominion Experimental Farm in Indian Head to demonstrate farming techniques.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} a <b>seed</b> <b>train</b> is the {{generation}} of an ade-quate number of cells for the inoculation of a produc-tion bioreactor. This is time- and cost-intensive. From volumes used for cell thawing or cell line maintenance the cell number has to be increased. The cells are usually run through many cultivation systems which become larger with each passage. The <b>seed</b> <b>train</b> steps {{have a significant impact}} on the product titer and cell growth in production scale, as well as the success and the reproducibility of the <b>seed</b> <b>train</b> itself. Furthermore, cell line changes in the existing facil-ity require adaptions of the <b>seed</b> <b>train</b> protocol. The design of a new facility involves the choice of the optimal <b>seed</b> <b>train</b> scales in order to meet the future requirements of the cultivated cell lines...|$|E

Bio-reactors might be intended for <b>seed</b> <b>train</b> and production, research, process development, validation or transfer purposes. During these activities, not only the problem of up- and downscaling might lead to failure of repro-ducibility, but also the use of different bioreactor geometries and opera-tion conditions. In such cases, the criteria for bioreactor design and process transfer should be re-evaluated in order to avoid an erroneous transfer of cultivation parameters.

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose to}} use semi-supervised {{learning}} methods to classify evaluative expressions, that is, tuples of subjects, their attributes, and evaluative words, that indicate either favorable or unfavorable opinions towards a specific subject. Due to its characteristics, the semisupervised method {{that we use}} can classify evaluative expressions in a corpus by their polarities. This can be accomplished starting from a very small set of <b>seed</b> <b>training</b> examples and using contextual information in the sentences to which the expressions belong. Our experimental results with actual Weblog data show that this bootstrapping approach can improve the accuracy of methods for classifying favorable and unfavorable opinions. ...|$|R
30|$|Unlike e-pPCR, qPCR data {{collection}} occurs during the reaction, thus making any sample preparation time a larger fraction of total assay throughput time. We determined {{the extent to}} which the presence of disrupted CHO cells effects amplification efficiency—a key metric for multiple statistical approaches to analysis of quantitative real-time PCR data. The presence of cellular material from shake flasks had no effect on genomic target amplification efficiency profile (Fig.  4 a) whereas material from bioreactors did constrict the range of reactions for which acceptable amplification efficiency was observed (Fig.  4 b). This indicates that, for many commonly used qPCR methods, only minimal and rapid sample preparation is required for samples taken in the early, <b>seed</b> <b>train,</b> stages of industrial CHO cell cultivation. For amplification of a mycoplasmal sequence (Fig.  9), the presence of CHO material originating from shake flask or bioreactor cultivation influenced amplification efficiency only when greater than 1.54  ×  107 or less than 1500 copies of the plasmid were present in the reaction.|$|E
30|$|A clonally derived {{glutamine}} synthase (GS) CHO {{cell line}} stably expressing an antibody-based therapeutic was cultivated in 1 L Erlenmeyer shake flasks (SF) {{according to the}} protocol described by Velez-Suberbie et al. (2013) until a viable cell count of 2.5  ×  106  cell/mL was reached, as determined by ViCell-XR cell viability analyser (Beckman Coulter, USA). At this point a sample was taken for further PCR experiments (Fig.  2 a). This stage represents a critical point of industrial scale cultivation where the <b>seed</b> <b>train</b> is used to inoculate the larger scale growth vessel. The shake flask culture was added to CD-CHO media in a rocked bag bioreactor to an initial concentration of 2.5  ×  105  cells/mL. Bioreactor cultivation was performed in a 3 L Applikon Appliflex (Applikon, Holland) flexible rocked bag bioreactor, controlled by an Applikon EZ controller system. Temperature was kept at 37  °C with the dissolved oxygen (DO) set-point at 30  % and the pH set-point at 7.1  ±  0.05. Glucose concentration was maintained at 150  g/L, as determined by NOVA Bioanalyser 400 (NOVA Biomedical, Waltham, USA), by supplementing with 10 × concentrated CD-CHO media (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). Cells grew to achieve 1  ×  107  cells/mL with ~ 99  % viability (Fig.  2 b) in the bioreactor and a sample was removed for PCR.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{economic}} pressure {{is the main}} driving force to enhance the efficiency of existing processes. We developed a perfusion strategy for a <b>seed</b> <b>train</b> reactor to generate a higher inoculum density for a subsequent fed batch production culture. A higher inoculum density can reduce culture duration without compromising product titers. Hence, a better capacity utilization can be achieved. The perfusion strategy was planned to be implemented in an existing large scale antibody production process. Therefore, facility and process constraints had to be considered. This article describes the initial development steps. Using a proprietary medium and a Chinese hamster ovary cell line expressing an IgG antibody, four different cell retention devices were compared in regard to retention efficiency and reliability. Two devices were selected for further process refinement, a centrifuge and an inclined gravitational settler. A concentrated feed medium {{was developed to meet}} facility constraints regarding maximum accumulated perfundate volume. A 2 -day batch phase followed by 5 days of perfusion resulted in cell densities of 1. 6 x 1010 cells L- 1, a 3. 5 fold increase compared to batch cultivations. Two reactor volumes of concentrated feed medium were needed to achieve this goal. Eleven cultivations were carried out in bench and 50 L reactors showing acceptable reproducibility and ease of scale up. In addition, it was shown that at least three perfusion phases can be combined within a repeated perfusion strategy...|$|E

40|$|This report {{explores the}} design of an {{influenza}} vaccine manufacturing facility using a non-egg based expression platform. The current standard procedure in flu vaccine production is to grow the virus in bird eggs. However, recently {{there is evidence that}} supports production by other expression platforms. The Sf 9 insect cell is considered in this report. Facility design including cell culture media formulation through product storage for shipment and final formulation is considered based on the use of an existing facility. The new design also employs the use of disposable equipment such as bioreactors and purification unit operations. These disposables help reduce production time and are an economically viable option. Market trends are analyzed, and it is concluded that production capabilities for this proposed facility should be about 60 million doses per year to accommodate one third of the market and be able to account for potential epidemics. At this production, revenue is approximately $ 391 million per year. Capital costs are very low due {{to the use of the}} existing facility, and manufacturing costs are also very reasonable even with the use of disposable equipment. Based on a 10 year project lifetime, the NPV for the project is approximately $ 460 million. The project is economically robust when considering various factors such as fluctuating dosage selling price, dosage demand, and manufacturing costs. A major concern for the profitability of this project is if the market will accept large quantities of vaccine produced by new methods that are not historically tested and proven to work. More research should conducted to determine how the market will react to such changes. The next step in the design process is to conduct laboratory and pilot-scale tests to determine more exact cell and virus growth curves for the <b>seed</b> <b>train</b> and the bioreactors. Once this information is collected, more precise designs can be formulated. Based on the considerations in this report, the production of influenza vaccine using the Sf 9 expression platform is viable both economically and in its ability to meet market demands in a timely manner. Companies on the leading edge of this development will have a great deal to gain...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} an exemplar-based nested hyper-rectangle learning model (NHLM) {{which is an}} efficient and accurate supervised classification model. The proposed model {{is based on the}} concept of <b>seeding</b> <b>training</b> data in the Euclidean m-space (where m denotes the number of features) as hyper-rectangles. To express the exceptions, these hyper-rectangles may be nested inside one another to an arbitrary depth.

Furthermore, the “second chance ” heuristic is introduced in NHLM to avoid creating more memory objects than necessary. NHLM is applied to solving the land cover classification problem in Taiwan using remote sensed ima-gery. The study investigated five land cover classes and clouds. These six classes were chosen from field investiga-tion of the study area according to previous study.

40|$|In a goal-oriented spoken dialog system, {{the major}} aim of {{language}} understanding is to classify utterances into {{one or more}} of the pre-defined intents and extract the associated named entities. Typically, the intents are designed by a human expert according to the application domain. Furthermore, these systems are trained using large amounts of data manually labeled using an already prepared labeling guide. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised spoken language understanding approach based on the taskindependent semantic role labeling of the utterances. The goal is to extract the predicates and the associated arguments from spoken language by using semantic role labeling and determine the intents based on these predicate/argument pairs. We propose an iterative approach using the automatically labeled utterances with semantic roles as the <b>seed</b> <b>training</b> data for intent classification. We have evaluated this understanding approach using two AT&T spoken dialog system applications used for customer care. We have shown that the semantic parses obtained without using any syntactically or semantically labeled in-domain data can represent the semantic intents without a need for manual intent and labeling guide design and labeling phases.
