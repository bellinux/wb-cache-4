40|$|Good {{communication}} in English {{produced by the}} students {{is one of the}} goals of language learning. The students are required to have good pronunciation. Nevertheless, the teacher seldom explains pronunciation in details which makes it as obstacles for the students to produce good pronunciation in English. Mispronunciation that produced by the students will make the listeners get wrong idea about their statement. In this study, the writer attempted to find out the kinds <b>of</b> vowel <b>sound</b> shifts and the causes <b>of</b> the vowel <b>sound</b> shifts produced by the eighth grade students at SMP Darul Qur-an Singosari. In conducting the study, the writer used descriptive research with 32 students of eighth grade at SMP Darul Qur-an Singosari chosen randomly as the research subjects. The instruments used by the writer to collect the data were performance assessment and interview. The findings of this study revealed that the students shifted 19 sounds from 20 vowel sounds. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ɒ/ shifts into /ʊ/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ə/ shifts into /ʌ/, /e/, and /ɒ/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ʌ/ shifts into /ɒ/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ɜ:/ shifts into /ɪ/, /i:/, and /e/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /aʊ/ shifts into /ɒ/ and /ʌ/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /i:/ shifts into /e/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /aɪ/ shifts into /ə/, /ɪ/, /e/, and /eɪ/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /Ã¦/ shifts into /aɪ/, /eɪ/, and /e/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /u:/ shifts into /əʊ/, /Ã¦/, /ʊə/, /aʊ/, /ʊ/, and /e/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /eə/ shifts into /e/ and /ʌ/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ɪ/ shifts into /ʌ/, /ʊ/ and /aɪ/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /əʊ/ shifts into /ɒ/ and /ʊ/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /eɪ/ shifts into /ə/, /ʌ/, /e/, and /ɒ/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ɪə/ shifts into/e/, /ɪ/, and /ə/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ɔ:/ shifts into /ɒ/, /aʊ/, /ʊ/ and /eɪ/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /e/ shifts into /ʌ/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ʊ/ shifts into /ɒ/ and /ʌ/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ɑ:/ shifts into /e/ and /ə/. The vowel <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> /ʊə/ shifts into /ɒ/. It was influenced by native language, age, exposure, innate phonetic ability, and motivation and concern or good pronunciation. To sum up, pronunciation is an important feature when the learners are speaking. A single word that shifts will make different meaning...|$|R
