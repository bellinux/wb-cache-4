5|$|After the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the Left <b>Socialist</b> <b>Revolutionaries</b> had {{abandoned}} the coalition and increasingly viewed the Bolsheviks as traitors to the revolution. In July 1918, the Left <b>Socialist</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin assassinated the German ambassador to Russia, Wilhelm von Mirbach, hoping that the ensuing diplomatic incident {{would lead to a}} relaunched revolutionary war against Germany. The Left <b>Socialist</b> <b>Revolutionaries</b> then launched a coup in Moscow, shelling the Kremlin and seizing the city's central post office before being stopped by Trotsky's forces. The party's leaders and many members were arrested and imprisoned, but were treated more leniently than other opponents of the Bolsheviks.|$|R

50|$|While an emigre, Hrushevsky {{began to}} adopt a pro-Bolshevik position. Along {{with other members of}} the Ukrainian Party of <b>Socialist</b> <b>Revolutionaries</b> he formed the Foreign Delegation of the Ukrainian Party of <b>Socialist</b> <b>Revolutionaries</b> which {{advocated}} reconciliation with the Bolshevik regime. Though the group was critical of the Bolsheviks, especially due to their centralism and repressive activities in Ukraine, it felt that these criticisms had to be put aside, because the Bolsheviks were the leaders of the international revolution. Hrushevsky and his group petitioned the Ukrainian SSR government to legalise the Ukrainian Party of <b>Socialist</b> <b>Revolutionaries</b> and allow the members of the Foreign Delegation to return. The Ukrainian SSR government was unwilling to do this. Consequently, by 1921 the Foreign Delegation of the Ukrainian Party of <b>Socialist</b> <b>Revolutionaries</b> had ended its activity. Nevertheless, all of its members returned to Ukraine, including Hrushevsky, who went back in 1924.|$|R

5|$|The Provisional Government {{had planned}} for a Constituent Assembly {{to be elected}} in November 1917; against Lenin's objections, Sovnarkom agreed for the vote to take place as scheduled. In the {{constitutional}} election, the Bolsheviks gained approximately {{a quarter of the}} vote, being defeated by the agrarian-focused <b>Socialist</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Party. Lenin argued that the election was not a fair reflection of the people's will, that the electorate had not had time to learn the Bolsheviks' political programme, and that the candidacy lists had been drawn up before the Left <b>Socialist</b> <b>Revolutionaries</b> split from the <b>Socialist</b> <b>Revolutionaries.</b> Nevertheless, the newly elected Russian Constituent Assembly convened in Petrograd in January 1918. Sovnarkom argued that it was counter-revolutionary because it sought to remove power from the soviets, but the <b>Socialist</b> <b>Revolutionaries</b> and Mensheviks denied this. The Bolsheviks presented the Assembly with a motion that would strip it of most of its legal powers; when the Assembly rejected the motion, Sovnarkom declared this as evidence of its counter-revolutionary nature and forcibly disbanded it.|$|R
