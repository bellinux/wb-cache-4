5|$|As Liz Lemon is {{returning}} to studio 6H, the TGS with Tracy Jordan studio, she meets Jack Donaghy returning from Washington. Jack tells her {{that he intends to}} get his old job back and Liz tells him of her upcoming adoption evaluation. When he confronts Devon Banks in his office, Devon offers Jack a position in the mail room, laughing, but Jack accepts. Jack later tells Liz of his plan to work his way back to his old job through honest means, though Kathy Geiss (Marceline Hugot) shows a <b>sexual</b> <b>interest</b> in Jack he could leverage into a quicker promotion. When he discovers that Devon is planning to shut down GE, Jack, with Liz's help, convinces Kathy to hire him as her business adviser. Devon, realizing that he has been beaten, decides on a new path to securing his financial future: hurling himself in front of a series of moving cars so that he can sue the drivers.|$|E
5|$|In his American incarnation, Pedobear is an {{anthropomorphic}} bear child predator that {{is often}} used within the community to mock contributors showing a <b>sexual</b> <b>interest</b> in children. Pedobear {{is one of the}} most popular memes on non-English imageboards, and has gained recognition across Europe. In February 2010, a photoshopped version of Pedobear appeared along with mascots of the 2010 Winter Olympics in an article on the games in Gazeta Olsztyńska, a Polish newspaper. This was done accidentally; due to the image being used from Google Images, the authors were unaware of the joke. Similarly, the Dutch television guide Avrobode used one of the images. It has been used as a symbol of pedophilia by Maltese graffiti vandals prior to a papal visit.|$|E
5|$|Michael's {{hatred of}} Toby has been {{transferred}} to the new human resources representative, Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), and he and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) plan to haze her. When she playfully affects disdain for Toby, Michael takes her seriously, and suddenly {{falls in love with}} her. Taking advice from Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Michael succeeds in warming Holly up with small talk and jokes, and even tempers Toby's exit interview, which he had originally planned to be brutally insulting, because Holly attends. Dwight, however, continues the hazing, telling Holly that Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) is mentally challenged, and putting a raccoon in her car. When Michael catches Dwight trying to release a raccoon into Holly's car, he loudly proclaims his esteem for Holly. Holly gives special attention to Kevin throughout the episode due to her belief that he is mentally challenged, but Kevin believes her attention is a <b>sexual</b> <b>interest</b> in him.|$|E

5000|$|Many terms {{have been}} used to {{describe}} atypical <b>sexual</b> <b>interests,</b> and there remains debate regarding technical accuracy and perceptions of stigma. Sexologist John Money popularized the term paraphilia as a non-pejorative designation for unusual <b>sexual</b> <b>interests.</b> Money described paraphilia as [...] "a sexuoerotic embellishment of, or alternative to the official, ideological norm." [...] Psychiatrist Glen Gabbard writes that despite efforts by Stekel and Money, [...] "the term paraphilia remains pejorative in most circumstances." ...|$|R

5|$|Unable to {{find work}} in Vancouver, Smith headed to Los Angeles in California, United States. On the way he stopped at San Francisco, where he met with Cecil Frederick Russell, a Thelemite who had {{departed}} from the Crowleyan orthodoxy to found his own group, the Choronzon Club. Smith however disliked Russell, and later claimed {{that he had been}} unnerved when Russell began expressing a <b>sexual</b> <b>interest</b> in children. After settling in Los Angeles, Smith gained a job at the Southern California Gas Company, entered into a relationship with a woman named Ann Barry, and began attending occasional meetings of the United Lodge of Theosophists, an esoteric organisation centred in the city. Jones meanwhile had united Thelema with auto-suggestion to found his own group, the Psychomagian Society (PMS), and he appointed Smith to be its Local Recorder for Los Angeles; out of friendship to Jones, Smith did so, but was uninterested in the PMS' teachings. Through their correspondences, Crowley came to reject the PMS and relations between himself and Jones once again broke down, this time permanently. Smith retained much affection for Jones, whom he saw as his mentor and friend, but nevertheless agreed with Crowley over the PMS and also rejected Jones' ongoing fascination with the UB, which Smith considered incompatible with Thelema; their relationship too came to an end in 1926.|$|E

50|$|Courtship {{disorder}} is a theoretical construct in sexology {{in which a}} certain set of paraphilias are seen as specific instances of anomalous courtship instincts in men. The specific paraphilias are biastophilia (paraphilic rape), exhibitionism, frotteurism, telephone scatologia, and voyeurism. According to the courtship disorder hypothesis, there is a species-typical courtship process in human males consisting of four phases, and anomalies in different phases result {{in one of these}} paraphilic <b>sexual</b> <b>interests.</b> That is, instead of being independent paraphilias, this theory sees these <b>sexual</b> <b>interests</b> as individual symptoms of a single underlying disorder.|$|R

25|$|Adolescent {{sexuality}} is {{a stage of}} human development in which adolescents experience and explore sexual feelings. Interest in sexuality intensifies during the onset of puberty, and {{sexuality is}} often a vital aspect of teenagers' lives. In humans, <b>sexual</b> <b>interest</b> may be expressed {{in a number of}} ways, such as flirting, kissing, masturbation, or having sex with a partner. <b>Sexual</b> <b>interest</b> among adolescents, as among adults, can vary greatly, and is influenced by cultural norms and mores, sex education provided, sexual orientation, and social controls such as age of consent laws.|$|E

5000|$|Charles Allen Moser {{pointed out}} that this change is not really {{substantive}} as DSM-IV already acknowledged a difference between paraphilias and non-pathological but unusual <b>sexual</b> <b>interests,</b> a distinction that is virtually identical to what is being proposed for DSM-5, {{and it is a}} distinction that, in practice, has often been ignored. Linguist Andrew Clinton Hinderliter argued that [...] "Including some sexual interests—but not others—in the DSM creates a fundamental asymmetry and communicates a negative value judgment against the <b>sexual</b> <b>interests</b> included," [...] and leaves the paraphilias in a situation similar to ego-dystonic homosexuality, which was removed from the DSM because it was realized not to be a mental disorder.|$|R
25|$|In popular usage, {{the word}} pedophilia is often applied to any <b>sexual</b> <b>interest</b> in {{children}} or {{the act of}} child sexual abuse. This use conflates the sexual attraction to prepubescent children with the act of child sexual abuse, and fails to distinguish between attraction to prepubescent and pubescent or post-pubescent minors. Researchers recommend that these imprecise uses be avoided because although people who commit child sexual abuse are sometimes pedophiles, child sexual abuse offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a primary or exclusive <b>sexual</b> <b>interest</b> in prepubescent children, and some pedophiles do not molest children.|$|E
25|$|People {{can become}} aroused {{by the thought}} of sexual partners, acts, and {{situations}} that are not truly desired, whereas every detail of the limerent fantasy is passionately desired actually to take place. Limerence sometimes increases <b>sexual</b> <b>interest</b> in other partners when the limerent object is unreceptive or unavailable.|$|E
25|$|Developmental causes {{may also}} result in sexual {{harassment}} among students.

50|$|He studied sexual behavior, coining {{the term}} erotic fetishism to {{describe}} individuals whose <b>sexual</b> <b>interests</b> in nonhuman objects, such as articles of clothing, and linking {{this to the}} after-effects of early impressions in an anticipation of Freud.|$|R
50|$|Most psychologists {{believe that}} paraphilic <b>sexual</b> <b>interests</b> cannot be altered. Instead, {{the goal of}} therapy is {{normally}} to reduce the person's discomfort with their paraphilia and limit any criminal behavior. Both psychotherapeutic and pharmacological methods are available to these ends.|$|R
40|$|The {{emotional}} Stroop task {{has been}} used to assess deviant <b>sexual</b> <b>interests</b> of <b>sexual</b> abusers. Two limitations noted in the literature are difficulties surrounding the choice of word stimuli and the task’s inability to elicit significant differences between offender subtypes thus far. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine differences in emotional Stroop bias between three adult groups using new, empirically-derived, word stimuli intended to reflect <b>sexual</b> <b>interests</b> more specific to sexual abusers. Significant differences were found between sexual abusers and non-offending controls for affective and sexual word stimuli. The results further support differential processing biases between sexual offenders and non offenders however difficulties in differentiating between offender groups are still evident. Implications of these findings are discussed and recommendations for future research are made...|$|R
25|$|Typically, {{older men}} and women {{maintaining}} interest in <b>sexual</b> <b>interest</b> and activity could be therapeutic; {{it is a way}} of expressing their love and care for one another. Factors such as biological and psychological factors, diseases, mental conditions, boredom with the relationship, and widowhood have been found to contribute with the common decrease in <b>sexual</b> <b>interest</b> and activity in old age. National sex surveys given in Finland in the 1990s revealed aging men had a higher incidence of sexual intercourse compared to aging women and that women were more likely to report a lack of sexual desire compared to men. Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity. Both aging genders agreed they needed good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a sexually skilful partner to maintain sexual desire.|$|E
25|$|The 'rape as a by-product' {{explanation}} {{holds that}} rape behaviour evolved as {{a by-product of}} other psychological adaptations in men to obtain many mates. This adaptation not only leads to rape {{but a number of}} other behaviours including overrating female <b>sexual</b> <b>interest,</b> a desire for sexual variety, coercion, and sexual arousal which is not dependent on the consent of mate.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} section, Bailey {{summarizes}} a taxonomy of transsexual women that was proposed by Ray Blanchard about fifteen years earlier. According to Blanchard, {{there are two}} types of transsexual women: one described as an extreme form of male homosexuality, the other being motivated by a <b>sexual</b> <b>interest</b> in having a female body. Bailey also discusses the process by which transition from male to female occurs.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, Gengoroh Tagame began {{producing}} erotic manga {{drawn from}} his own <b>sexual</b> <b>interests,</b> featuring large, masculine men engaging in sadomasochistic sex with each other.

50|$|Some groups, seeking greater {{understanding}} {{and acceptance of}} sexual diversity, have lobbied for changes to the legal and medical status of unusual <b>sexual</b> <b>interests</b> and practices.

5000|$|Paraphilias (atypical <b>sexual</b> <b>interests)</b> {{have also}} been linked to higher rates of left-handedness.

[...] Greater rates of left-handedness has also been documented among individuals who have pedophilia.|$|R
25|$|The words pedophile and pedophilia are {{commonly}} used informally to describe an adult's <b>sexual</b> <b>interest</b> in pubescent or post-pubescent teenagers. The terms hebephilia or ephebophilia may be more accurate in these cases. This was especially seen {{in the case of}} Mark Foley during the congressional page incident. Most of the media labeled Foley a pedophile, which led David Tuller of Slate magazine to state that Foley was not a pedophile but rather an ephebophile.|$|E
25|$|Men's <b>sexual</b> <b>interest</b> in youths was {{reflected}} in prostitution, with young male sex workers fetching higher prices than their female counterparts {{as recently as the}} beginning of the 20th century. In Tianjin there were thirty-five male brothels, housing 800 boys. Although the superintendent of trade at Guangzhou issued an annual warning to the population against permitting westerners access to boy prostitutes ("do not indulge the Western barbarian with all our best favors"), Europeans were increasingly welcomed in the boy brothels.|$|E
25|$|Bewildered by his callous {{indifference}} to their separation, Nina sublets their apartment, leaves their beloved cat behind and joins {{her husband in}} India.

Sad and alone, she stays in New York, finding comfort in a new cat and her study of the Ramayana.|$|E

5000|$|Masochism was {{the term}} {{employed}} by the DSM-II. [...] In that manual, the condition was classified as a sexual deviation, which was used to describe “individuals whose <b>sexual</b> <b>interests</b> are directed primarily toward…coitus performed under bizarre circumstances” (p. 44).

40|$|This {{study of}} 410 adult male sex {{offenders}} against children, {{using data from}} the Dynamic Supervision Project (Hanson, Harris, Scott, & Helmus, 2007), examined the construct, predictive, and incremental validity of the Screening Scale for Pedophilic Interests (SSPI; Seto & Lalumière, 2001), a brief proxy measure of phallometrically assessed sexual response to children that is based on sexual victim characteristics. As predicted, the SSPI was significantly related to the Deviant <b>Sexual</b> <b>Interests</b> item on the STABLE- 2007 (Hanson et al., 2007), a dynamic risk measure encompassing multiple domains, and with the Deviant <b>Sexual</b> <b>Interests</b> item from its predecessor, the STABLE- 2000 (Hanson et al., 2007). The SSPI was unrelated (or more weakly related) to items measuring general antisociality. In addition, the SSPI significantly predicted sexual recidivism, defined as new charges or convictions for sexual offenses, and a broader sexual recidivism outcome that included breaches of community supervision conditions that might involve sexually motivated behavior (e. g., being in the presence of children unsupervised). The SSPI did not add to the predictive accuracy of 2 actuarial risk measures, the Static- 99 R and Static- 200 R (Helmus, Thornton, Hanson, & Babchishin, 2012), but it did add to the predictive accuracy of the STABLE- 2007. Additional analyses suggest the SSPI can serve as a substitute for the STABLE- 2007 Deviant <b>Sexual</b> <b>Interests</b> item, if necessary (e. g., in archival research), when assessing sexual offenders against children...|$|R
