It {{is sold in}} standard and professional releases, some releases including text figures and <b>small</b> <b>caps</b> (in the roman style only). Like several other Monotype typefaces digitised in the early period of computerised publishing, it is sold under two releases credited both to Monotype itself and to Adobe, the latter only in the standard version without <b>small</b> <b>caps.</b> Fleet Titling and the Initial Teaching Alphabet version have not been digitised.|$|E
5|$|Released in 1989, Adobe Garamond is {{designed}} by Robert Slimbach for Adobe Systems, {{based on a}} Roman type by Garamond and an italic type by Robert Granjon. The font family contains regular, semibold, and bold weights and was developed through viewing fifteenth-century equipment at the Plantin-Moretus Museum. Its quite even, mature design attracted attention on release for its authenticity to Garamond's work, a contrast to the much more aggressive ITC Garamond popular at the time. The OpenType version of the font family was released in 2000 as Adobe Garamond Pro, with enhanced support for its alternate glyphs such as ligatures, <b>small</b> <b>caps</b> and italic swash capitals, and is sold through Adobe's Typekit system. It {{is one of the}} most popular versions of Garamond in books and fine printing.|$|E

40|$|The paper investigates if {{international}} <b>small</b> <b>cap</b> {{has been}} distinctly different from large caps and therefore {{deserved to be}} part of a policy benchmark. Our results indicated an increase in correlations between aggregated MSCI EAFE <b>Small</b> <b>Cap</b> and Standard Indexes in recent years. But the challenges in <b>small</b> <b>cap</b> investing have been different as the level of stock return dispersion has been larger than within the standard segment and decisions on country allocation had a bigger impact on portfolio performance within the <b>small</b> <b>cap</b> segment. We therefore conclude that an explicit allocation (or none at all) to international <b>small</b> <b>cap</b> would have provided additional diversification benefits during the period reviewed...|$|R

25|$|Adobe Caslon is a {{very popular}} revival {{designed}} by Carol Twombly. It is based on Caslon's own specimen pages printed between 1734 and 1770 {{and is a member}} of the Adobe Originals programme.

25|$|If no ß is available, ss or sz is {{used instead}} (sz {{especially}} in Hungarian-influenced eastern Austria). This applies especially to all caps or <b>small</b> <b>caps</b> texts because ß had no generally accepted majuscule form until 2017. Excepted are all-caps names in legal documents; they may retain an ß to prevent ambiguity (for instance: STRAßER, since Straßer and Strasser are both possible names).|$|E
25|$|Released by Font Bureau, it {{includes}} bold and bold italic designs, {{and a complete}} feature set across all weights, including bold <b>small</b> <b>caps</b> and swash italic alternates as well as optional shorter descenders and a 'modernist' italic option to turn off swashes on lower-case letters and reduce the slant on the 'A' for a more spare appearance. It is currently used in Boston magazine and by Foreign Affairs.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} cross-autocorrelation {{structure}} in the German and Turkish stock markets by using daily portfolio returns. We find the evidence that large <b>cap</b> portfolios lead <b>small</b> <b>cap</b> portfolios in both subperiods of German stock market but this structure is seen only in the first subperiod of Turkish stock market. Analysing the market-wide and portfolio-specific information effects on portfolio returns shows that above stated lead-lag relation {{is associated with the}} market-wide information content in lagged large cap portfolio returns. We also document a directional asymmetry in <b>small</b> (large) <b>cap</b> portfolio returns’ reactions to lagged large (<b>small)</b> <b>cap</b> portfolio returns. The evidence is contradicting to the previous findings of McQueen, Pinegar and Thorley (1996) and Marshall and Walker (2002) whoose researches are conducted on US and Chile stock markets. Our findings show the lagged effects of bad news - not good news - on <b>small</b> <b>cap</b> portfolio returns. It is documented that the speed of adjustment of <b>small</b> <b>cap</b> portfolio prices to common market-wide information is slower than large cap portfolio prices and <b>small</b> <b>cap</b> portfolio prices are slower in reacting to bad news.

25|$|LTC Caslon is a {{digitisation}} of the Lanston Type Company's 14 {{point size}} Caslon 337 of 1915 (itself {{a revival of}} the original Caslon types). This family include fonts in regular and bold weights, with fractions, ligatures, <b>small</b> <b>caps</b> (regular and regular italic only), swashes (regular italic weight only), and Central European characters. An notable feature is that like some hot metal releases of Caslon, two separate options for descenders are provided for all styles: long descenders (creating a more elegant designs) or short (allowing tighter linespacing).|$|E
25|$|Additional or {{supplemental}} glyphs {{intended to}} match a main typeface {{have been in}} use for centuries. In some formats they have been marketed as separate fonts. In the early 1990s, the Adobe Systems type group introduced the idea of expert set fonts, which had a standardized set of additional glyphs, including <b>small</b> <b>caps,</b> old style figures, and additional superior letters, fractions and ligatures {{not found in the}} main fonts for the typeface. Supplemental fonts have also included alternate letters such as swashes, dingbats, and alternate character sets, complementing the regular fonts under the same family. However, with introduction of font formats such as OpenType, those supplemental glyphs were merged into the main fonts, relying on specific software capabilities to access the alternate glyphs.|$|E
25|$|Many {{men went}} bareheaded and, {{apart from the}} Emperor, they were {{normally}} so in votive depictions, which may distort the record we have. In the late Byzantine period a number of extravagantly large hats were worn as uniform by officials. In the 12th century, Emperor Andronikos Komnenos wore a hat shaped like a pyramid, but eccentric dress {{is one of many}} things he was criticised for. This was perhaps related to the very elegant hat with a very high-domed peak, and a sharply turned-up brim coming far forward in an acute triangle to a sharp point (left), that was drawn by Italian artists when the Emperor John VIII Palaiologos went to Florence and the Council of Ferrara in 1438 in {{the last days of the}} Empire. Versions of this and other clothes, including many spectacular hats, worn by the visitors were carefully drawn by Pisanello and other artists. They passed through copies across Europe for use in Eastern subjects, especially for depictions of the three kings or Magi in Nativity scenes. In 1159 the visiting Crusader Prince Raynald of Châtillon wore a tiara shaped felt cap, embellished in gold. An Iberian wide brimmed felt hat came into vogue during the 12th century. Especially in the Balkans, <b>small</b> <b>caps</b> with or without fur brims were worn, of the sort later adopted by the Russian Tsars.|$|E

500|$|Light {{at the red}} end of {{the visible}} {{spectrum}} has been observed to be required {{for the development of}} R.palmatus fruit bodies, contrary to the typical requirement for blue light seen with many other mushroom species. Fruiting occurs in the presence of green, yellow or red light with wavelengths above 500nm, but only when blue light (under 500nm) is absent. Consequently, phenotypic variations observed in the field—such as size, shape, and cap color—may be influenced by differing conditions of light color and intensity. For example, specimens grown in the laboratory under green light had fruit bodies with short, straight stems and pale orange, large caps with well-developed ridges and pits, an appearance similar to specimens found in the field that were growing under a canopy of green leaves. Laboratory-grown specimens under amber light had bright orange, <b>small</b> <b>caps</b> with less pronounced similarly, field specimens found in the fall, after the leaves had fallen, were more orange to orange-pink in color.|$|E

40|$|In {{the light}} of recent {{evidence}} that liquidity and idiosyncratic risk may be priced factors in the cross section of expected stock returns and that market capitalization significantly affects investor behavior and liquidity, we explore the interactions between liquidity, idiosyncratic risk and return across {{time as well as}} across size-based portfolios of stocks listed in the London Stock Exchange. In a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) analytical framework, we find that volatility spills over from large <b>cap</b> stocks to <b>small</b> <b>cap</b> stocks and vice versa. Volatility shocks can be predicted by illiquidity shocks in both large cap {{as well as in the}} <b>small</b> <b>cap</b> portfolios. Illiquidity can be predicted by return shocks in <b>small</b> <b>cap</b> stocks. Finally, we document some evidence of asymmetric liquidity spillovers, from large <b>cap</b> stocks to <b>small</b> <b>cap</b> ones, supporting the intuition that common information is first incorporated in the trading behavior of large-cap investors and the liquidity of large cap stocks and is then transmitted in the trading of small stocks. 1 Acknowledgement: We are grateful to V.

These have a unique design with dramatic stroke contrast, complementary but very different to Caslon's text faces; one was apparently originally created by Joseph Moxon rather than Caslon. The typeface is intended for use at 18pt and above. The standard weight is bundled with Apple's macOS operating system in a release including <b>small</b> <b>caps</b> and alternates such as the long s. Initially published by his company Carter & Cone, in 2014 Carter revisited the design adding bold and black designs with matching italics, and republished it through Font Bureau.
