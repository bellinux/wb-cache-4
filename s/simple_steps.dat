500|$|Prinz was an [...] "idea man" [...] {{rather than}} as a choreographer, {{creating}} lavish production numbers and using <b>simple</b> <b>steps</b> and dance routines. Jazz dance choreographer Jack Cole has said that Prinz [...] "didn't know a bloody thing about dancing." [...] In a 1952 profile, Associated Press Hollywood columnist James Bacon said that Prinz differed from what he described as [...] "sissified" [...] choreographers, that he was [...] "a rough, tough guy, as some little giants of 5 foot 5 are. His language is colorful." [...] He claimed to have never taken a lesson in his life and, in a reference to his family's dancing school, that he was a [...] "victim of heredity." ...|$|E

[...] Michelle Erica Green for TrekNation thought that the episode could have been better if the guest cast was up to a better quality. However, she felt that the episode fell foul of several TNG season one writing errors, such as Deanna Troi's statements breaking any mounting tension and the crew failing to do such quite <b>simple</b> <b>steps</b> such as separating feuding aliens and William Riker being held hostage {{for the second time in}} successive episodes.|$|E

500|$|Another design approach, {{particularly}} {{suitable for}} CAD {{because it is}} a numerical method, is to decompose the filter into a number of finite elements. [...] These elements are a large number of <b>simple</b> <b>steps</b> and ridges. [...] A number of methods are available to analyse the individual elements. [...] The mode matching technique expands the field equations of the element into a series of eigenfunctions and then for each mode matches the field at the interface between elements. [...] The Galerkin method expands the field equations into polynomial functions such as Gegenbauer polynomials or Chebyshev polynomials. [...] These methods can be mixed according to what is convenient for a particular type of element. [...] Whichever analysis method is used, the final output needed is the scattering parameters matrix for each element. [...] The overall filter response is then found from the combined scattering matrix of all the individual element matrices. [...] This method is analytic rather than synthetic, that is, a trial design must first exist in order to be analysed unlike synthesis methods where the starting point is a prescribed transfer function from which a design is synthesised.Manuilov and Kobrin, 2005, pp.93–94Manuilov et al., 2009, pp.527–528 ...|$|E
500|$|... "Underneath the Stars" [...] {{features}} a [...] "'70s soul vibe," [...] {{courtesy of the}} use of a Rhodes piano, as well as synthetic record scratches, in order to the give the song an authentic aged sound. The song also incorporates Carey's usage of double voice, in which she sings the verses in a lower octave, and then sings the crescendo and climax in a higher register over it. Carey felt the additions were <b>simple</b> <b>steps</b> taken to further display a contemporary R groove, and pay homage to the style of Minnie Riperton, who was one of Carey's biggest vocal influences growing up. According to author Chris Nickson, the song has a soft sound, and [...] "a lot of texture" [...] and bass, showing a more creative side to Carey. While reviewing Daydream, Stephen Holden from The New York Times described the song's double voice, as well as its lyrical content: [...] "'Underneath the Stars,' in which all the voices are Ms. Carey's, achieves the same dissolving synergy between a lyric and entwining vocal lines as she sings: [...] "Beautifully and bittersweetly / You were fading into me." ...|$|E

2500|$|CFLs, {{like all}} {{fluorescent}} lamps, contain {{small amounts of}} mercury, as both vapor and droplets inside the glass tubing, averaging 4.0mg per bulb. The inclusion of liquid mercury is specifically prohibited from other domestic products in some jurisdictions, notably Europe. [...] Safe cleanup of broken compact fluorescent lamps is different from cleanup of conventional broken glass or incandescent bulbs. After a proper cleanup, any potential short term exposure offers no significant health risks to adults, including pregnant women, or to children. If all electricity was generated by a coal power plant (which produce about half the electricity the U.S. consumes) and fluorescent light bulbs were all recycled with no mercury being lost, nearly 75% less mercury could be released in power plant emissions if incandescent bulbs were replaced by fluorescents, and with significantly less total mercury release even if no recycling occurred. However, a concern is that broken bulbs will introduce the mercury directly into a populated indoor area. Though more recent analysis indicates that the concerns about mercury release from broken bulbs may be overstated, and can be ameliorated by taking a few <b>simple</b> <b>steps.</b>|$|E
