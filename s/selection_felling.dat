All the trees have been inventoried in four permanent plots, each located in a part of the stand which has been selectively felled in a different year. Structural analysis has been carried out.

From the beginning of the 20 th century forest harvesting methods shifted from <b>selection</b> <b>felling</b> towards clear cutting. Modern, highly mechanised forestry with clear cutting, intensive silviculture, thinning of regenerating stands and short rotation times, has been employed in Fennoscandia since 1950 s and in the Baltic countries since 1990 s. Because in Fennoscandia and Baltic countries the majority of the forests are commercially managed conservation of biodiversity critically depends on management actions that take place in the production forests, i. e. in areas outside forest reserves. Hence, the focus of conservation has shifted towards multiscale conservation measures (Lindenmayer and Franklin, 2002). In addition to large ecological reserves, intermediate- and small- spatial scale conservation measures, such as biological hotspots and green tree retention, respectively, are taken place in the matrix. One tool for intermediate-spatial scale conservation of the forest biodiversity is the conservation of small habitat patches called Woodland Key Habitats (WKHs). Th...|$|E

This study uses fifty 0. 1 ha plots to quantify mean tree biomass of eight logging coupes (each 450 – 2500 ha) and two similarly sized areas in un-logged forest. These data were then correlated with the spectral radiance of individual Landsat- 5 TM bands over the 15 km x 15 km study area. Explanation of the differences in radiance between the ten forest sites was aided by measurements of the relative reflectance of selected leaves and canopies from ground and helicopter platforms. The analysis showed a marked variation in the stand biomass from 172 t ha- 1 in coupe C 88 that was disturbed by high-lead logging to 506 t ha- 1 in a similarly sized area of protection forest. A two parameter linear model of Landsat TM radiance in the near-infrared (NIR) band was able to explain 76 % of the variation in the biomass at this coupe-scale. The local-scale measurements indicated that the differences in the mean radiance of each coupe (in cloud-free areas) may relate to a change in the proportion of climax tree canopy relative to a cover of either pioneer trees or ginger/shrubs; the canopies of climax trees have the lowest NIR radiance of the vegetation characteristic of selectively logged forest. The coupe harvested following ‘Reduced Impact Logging’ guidelines had a residual biomass and NIR radiance more like that of undisturbed lowland dipterocarp forest than coupes disturbed by ‘conventional’ <b>selection</b> <b>felling.</b> The predictability of tree biomass (at the coupe-scale) by such a parsimonious model makes remote sensing a valuable tool in the management of tropical natural forests...|$|E
30|$|Schütz et al. (2012) {{wrote that}} “willingness” (defined as “readiness to do something” by Merriam-Webster 2014) {{is one of}} the main factors {{limiting}} the wider application of alternative management regimes. In addition to the reasons for the lack of “readiness” that have been discussed already, the role of strong intellectual, political, and administrative leadership is especially important in shaping public and professional opinions (Brukas and Weber 2009). The degree to which an organizational leadership champions alternative approaches influences the degree to which employees and contractors embrace and apply the practices. Strong support from upper management encourages employees and contractors to overcome operational challenges, as well as prejudices, enabling successful transition to alternative silviculture (Baker 2011). Other reasons may have a deeper, historical background. For example, the expansion of “scientific forestry” (sensu Oosthoek 2007; see also Lowood 1990), reflected in controlled management of homogenous, even-aged, mono-cultural plantations from central Europe at the end of the 19 th century, was accepted in other countries because it fitted prominent economic ideas about control and efficiency (Lang and Pye 2001; Oosthoek 2007; Cock 2008; Puettmann et al. 2009; Sears and Pinedo‐Vasquez 2011). This approach also helped to elevate forestry as an autonomous discipline at universities and research institutions, which facilitated its professional recognition by foresters and society in general. This historical development has led to several phenomena that are still influential today. The resulting expectation of simple, practical operational guidelines cannot easily be met by alternative silvicultural approaches, especially when they emphasize greater silvicultural flexibility (and outcomes) in a wide diversity of forest structures and species compositions. Moreover, the educational focus on conventional forestry has led to “imprinting” or “knowledge lock-in” in many practicing foresters who may consider only the predominant management model as acceptable. An example of this can be found in the management history of beech and black pine forests in the mountains of southern Italy, where <b>selection</b> <b>felling</b> based on traditional local knowledge and applied by private landowners during the last few centuries has been and often still is considered “irrational” by forest administrations and technicians (Ciancio et al. 2006; Nocentini 2009). Thus, the professional and public perceptions of alternative silvicultural approaches may have a major influence on the development of policies and implementation strategies (Brukas and Weber 2009).|$|E
40|$|Uneven-aged forest {{management}} based on selection systems {{is surrounded by}} strong feelings in Sweden and debates for and against {{have been going on}} for more than 100 years. The shift from selective felling, or high-grading, to sustained-yield forest policy eventually led to the use of clear cutting {{forest management}} systems on all boreal site types. The need for a more diverse set of silvicultural systems that emulate natural disturbance regimes has been emphasized in the recent Swedish forest policy debate. There are two aims of this thesis; 1) to estimate the amount of boreal continuous tree cover forest sites, i. e. sites that naturally were dominated by forests with gap phase and cohort dynamic, and the amount of pre-industrial agricultural woodlands, how much of such sites that hold old forest today and how they are managed, 2) To explore local forestry actor’s views on and knowledge about alternatives to the clear cutting silvicultural system. Two study areas, one in the south and one in the north part of the Swedish boreal forest, were examined using multiple methods for estimates of forest conditions and qualitative interviews with local forestry actors. In both study areas about 10 % of the forest landscape consisted of continuous tree cover sites. In addition there were high altitude mountain forests in the northern study area, and anthropogenic wooded grasslands in the southern study area. The present harvesting system was similar on all site types. In the southern study area forestry actors were more positive to unevenaged forest management systems than in the northern area. Foresters in both study areas blamed <b>selection</b> <b>felling</b> systems for the past unsustainable exploitation of the Swedish forests and were negative to using selection systems as alternatives for sustained yield production. However, they were positive to them as a complement to satisfy social and to some extent ecological values. To encourage the use of selection systems as a complement to the clear cutting system in areas with suitable site conditions and in areas with specific management goals {{there is a need for}} more knowledge about the consequences for different dimensions of sustainable forest management.

40|$|Diameter class {{distribution}} data, {{as well as}} {{diameter increment}} and increased number of trees, {{provide a basis for}} the simulation of stand development. With advances in computer technology, modelling and stand development research has shown increasing importance. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the establishment dynamics of a selection stand structure in mixed beech-fir forest on Papuk. In the past, these forests were managed as even-aged forests. The research was carried out in the Management Unit »Zapadni Papuk Zvečevački«, Kamenska Forest Office. Using the data from forest management plans (plans of 2006, 1996 and 1986), ten stands were selected for which dynamics simulation of conversion into uneven-age stands was performed. The stands were selected on the basis of age, tree diameter distribution, density and mixture. After simulation, sub-compartments 34 b, 42 b and 56 a were selected for display. The data for these stands are shown in Table 1. Theoretical growing stock models for mixed fir and beech stands were designed according to Klepac (1961). Felling dimensions for both species were 60 cm, while the growing stock mixture consisted of 60 % fir and 40 % beech (as set down in the management plan). The theoretical model was designed for both site class combinations: fir II/III – beech II, and fir III – beech II/III, using the original theoretical models by Klepac. To calculate the growing stock, we used local one-entry volume tables by species and site classes from the management plan. Table 2 and 3 show the designed theoretical models. Simulations were carried out with Excel files generated for this purpose. Input data for the simulation consisted of diameter distribution of trees taken from the management plan. Consequently, diameter distribution of trees for all coniferous was displayed as fir and all deciduous trees as beech. Simulation was carried out according to three scenarios, which define the felling volume as follows:Scenario 1 : Felling volume is calculated according to Klepac’s formula. Scenario 2 : Volume of the first three felling is calculated on the basis of maximally allowed felling intensity of 30 % of the growing stock. After this, Scenario 1 is applied. Scenario 3 : Felling volume is calculated as the difference between the actual growing stock before felling and the theoretical growing stock after felling. The simulations were carried out for the time interval of 100 years. The results presented in Fig. 2 show long-lasting establishment of an uneven stand structure in the stands with initially too large growing stock and lack of small diameter trees. In all the three scenarios, the beech approaches the theoretical model more rapidly than the fir, particularly in smaller tree diameter classes. Assumed achievement of mixture ratio to the theoretical one led to the faster decrease of the large firs. According to all the tree scenarios, the growing stock is reduced below the theoretical one (Fig. 3), but after this it begins to increase. In Scenario 1, this decrease is smaller, but longer-lasting than in the other two scenarios, which is the consequence of lower felling intensities in the first 50 years. Scenario 2 assumes the largest reduction in the growing stock, when a total of 30 % of initial growing stock is felled in the first three <b>selection</b> <b>felling</b> cycles. The actual growing stock just before the fourth felling amounts to 87 % of the theoretical one. In our opinion, the growing stock can be reduced so as not to fall below 70 % of the theoretical growing stock. According to Scenario 3, extreme felling intensity in the year 2013 is the consequence of too large growing stock. The mixture ratio approaches more or less linearly the theoretical one. In such stands there should be several intensive fellings, as is the case in Scenario 2, provided that the interval of the actual mixture ratio approaching the theoretical one is longer. This would allow for earlier felling of mature fir trees, especially if the loss of their quality is a matter of concern. This would also intensify the appearance of young trees. According to Scenario 1, a specified volume of the first felling is 151 m 3 /ha, according to Scenario 2 it is 149 m 3 /ha and according to Scenario 3 it amounts to 193 m 3 /ha. For the same stand, Zelić (2003) points out that the felling volume could be 104 m 3 /ha and 107 m 3 /ha, respectively. The ten-year volume increment based on the management plan for this stand is 107 m 3 /ha and the felling quantity is only 73 m 3 /ha (68 % increment), which is 17 % based on the actual growing stock at the moment of measurement. Such low felling volume, if achieved, will cause further decline of the stand structure and slow down the process of its conversion into the selection stand structure. According to the results shown in Fig. 4, the selection stand structure is established much earlier in stands that do not contain too large growing stock and that initially have trees in smaller diameter classes. Considering that the initial growing stock is slightly lower than the theoretical one (Fig. 5), according to Scenario 1 and 3 it begins to rise in proportion with increased felling intensity. Similarly to the stand mentioned above, Scenario 2 leads to a significant reduction in the growing stock in comparison to the theoretical one. For this reason, felling intensity in the fourth felling treatment is significantly lower. Such stands require 2 – 3 more intensive felling treatments in the beginning, as is the case with Scenario 2. This would intensify regeneration and transition of young trees into higher diameter classes. According to the simulation results for sub-compartment 42 b (Fig. 6), the procedure of converting young stands into the selection stand structure is relatively fast. The biggest problem with these stands relates to the low mean diameter of felled trees (about 20 cm for fir and 15 cm for beech). As for the low initial growing stock, it rises in all the three scenarios (Fig. 7). The biggest initial growth is related to Scenario 3 as the consequence of the absence of felling in the year 2015, because the simulated felling volume was less than 0. Scenarios 1 and 3 are appropriate for such stands. The percentage of annual volume increment given in the management plan based on management classes is 2. 76 %, whereas the prescribed ten year felling volume is 20. 2 %. Such low felling volumes will slow down the establishment of the selection stand structure. The results of this research show that the establishment of the selection stand structure is a long process that depends on its initial stage. This is in accordance with earlier results of selection stand simulation in stands with disturbed structure (Čavlović et al. 2006 a, Čavlović et al. 2006 b, Čavlović and Božić 2007 – 08), or in stands which were converted from even-aged (spruce) into uneven-aged stands (Hanewinkel and Pretsch 2000). Relative to the stands on Papuk, Zelić (2003) writes: »a part of the stands intended for selective stand management are over 80 years old; consequently, management of these stands should aim at converting them into selection stand management in short time (30 – 50 years) «. The management plan states that it will take at least 30 years to establish theoretical selection stand structure. The results of this research show that the process will take even longer, which coincides with Šafar’s (1963) writing: »Often it takes more than half a century for a stand to form a new structure. Every conversion from one form into another that occurs too fast is harmful because attempts to rapidly create different structures are detrimental to those trees which provide good increment«. The biggest problem of establishing the selection stand structure in stands that lack small diameter trees is the fact that it takes sometimes more than 40 years for the seedlings to emerge and reach the diameter of 10 cm (see the transition times in Fig. 1). Observing just the part of the stand above 10 cm in diameter with the theoretical model reveals additional degradation of the structure. Considering that the young growth does not occur over the whole area simultaneously, the time needed to achieve the theoretical recruitment is even longer. In order to accelerate the process of natural regeneration, group selection system is recommended wherever possible. Provided that intensive and timely tending treatments are applied in groups of trees below 10 cm diameter, the recruitment will be more intensive (Cestar 1960, Špalj 1962). The size of the tree group depends on site conditions and ecological requirements of particular tree species, especially in terms of their shade tolerance (Šafar 1963, Nyland 1998). We are aware of the fact that, with the passing of time, the actual stand structure in the field will more or less diverge from the simulated and theoretical model, among other things because felling is not predicted for diameter classes with insufficient number of trees. In addition, the prediction of recruitment, particularly for longer periods, is never accurate...|$|E

The phenotypic response to selection was highly asymmetrical in the direction of reduced mating speed, with estimates of realized heritability averaging 7 %. The selection response was largely attributable to a reduction in female receptivity. We assessed the whole genome transcriptional response to selection for mating speed using Affymetrix GeneChips and a rigorous statistical analysis. Remarkably, > 3, 700 probe sets (21 % of the array elements) exhibited a divergence in message levels between the Fast and Slow replicate lines. Genes with altered transcriptional abundance in response to <b>selection</b> <b>fell</b> into many different biological process and molecular function Gene Ontology categories, indicating substantial pleiotropy for this complex behavior. Future functional studies are necessary to test the extent to which transcript profiling of divergent selection lines accurately predicts genes that directly affect the selected trait...|$|R

The project of developing a new sauna lightning series was assigned two students at the developmentengineering program at Halmstad University. The main problem with lightning in the sauna is the heat and security aspect. The <b>selection</b> <b>fell</b> on LED technology as the lightning source, thanks to its small measures and low heat emission. The work of constructing of a lightning armature which the capability of cooling down the LED lightning was carried out during autumn ‐ 06 and spring ‐ 07. The project resulted in a brand new concept of sauna lightning, the usage of LED technology in the sauna have opened up new possibilities for designed sauna lightning. The lightning concept replaces an ordinary wooden panel in the sealing, the only visible part is the glass cover. By using a smart deign combined with extrusion of aluminum a profile only 12 millimeters thick that`s suitable for mounting in the sauna sealing was constructed. The construction guarantees an efficient cooling and sufficient lightning. The project resulted in a patented and design patented product. The project has further more resulted in a employment at Tylö AB for the project members.

40|$|This report {{concerns}} {{the implementation of}} a simulation framework to evaluate an emerging peer-to-peer network topology scheme using 8 -point hypercircles, entitled HyperCircle. This topology was proposed in order to alleviate some of the drawbacks of current P 2 P systems evolving in an uncontrolled manner, such as scalability issues, network overload and long search times. The framework is supposed to be used to evaluate the advantages of this new topology. The framework has been built on top of an existing simulator software solution, the selection of which was {{an important part of the}} development. Weighing different variables such as scalability and API usability, the <b>selection</b> <b>fell</b> on OverSim, an open-source discreet-event simulator based on OMNET++. After formalizing the protocol for easier implementation, as well as extending it for better performance, implementation followed using C++ with OverSim’s API and simulation library. Implemented as a module (alongside other stock modules providing their own protocols such as Chord and Kademlia), it can be used in OverSim to simulate a user-defined network using one of the simulation routine applications provided (or using a custom application written by the user). For the purposes of this thesis, the standard application KBRTestApp was used; an application sending test messages between randomly selected nodes, while adding and removing nodes at specific time intervals. The adding and removing of nodes can be configured with probability parameters. Tentative testing shows that this implementation of the HyperCircle protocol has a certain performance gain over the OverSim implementations of the Chord and Kademlia protocols, measurable in the time it takes a message to get from sender to recipient. Further testing is outside the scope of this thesis...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{understand}} the process of selecting soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.) promiscuous varieties by smallholders for soil fertility management in western Kenya. Eight varieties were screened on 2. 5  m ×  3  m plots that were managed according to farmers' practices and evaluated through participatory monitoring and evaluation approaches. Farmers selected preferred varieties and explained their reasons (criteria) for making the selections. Seven promiscuous varieties had better yields than a local one. Farmers' <b>selection</b> criteria <b>fell</b> into three broad categories relating to yield, appearance and labour. Selection criteria were not primarily aimed to improve soil fertility. This created a challenge to embed the new varieties within the local farming systems for soil fertility improvement. This study shows that farmer criteria for selecting varieties overlapped with scientific procedures.

30|$|An {{important}} attribute for old-growthness is {{the high}} number of late successional tree species (Bauhus et al. 2009), i.e. shade-tolerant and emergent mid-tolerant ones in the evergreen forest type. Tree species richness, diversity and evenness were not changed through selection cutting in the short-term, which is in accordance with findings in northern hardwood forest in North America (Angers et al. 2005; Crow et al. 2002). It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the direct harvesting effects of single-tree <b>selection</b> (e.g. tree <b>felling),</b> as conducted in the present study, are compatible with preserving tree species richness and diversity within the evergreen forest type in the short term. If management guidelines such as those applied in this study are used, the same should also apply for future applications.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of rationalized thinning technology in beech coppice stands was studied. Three basic methods of thinning: schematic, selection and combined method were analyzed. In {{the framework of}} each of the above thinning methods, different thinning varieties were designed, differing by the degree of crosscutting, width of gathering lines and their distance. The applied method of felling and crosscutting is the whole tree method or log method, and the form of work organization (1 M+ 1 R). The felling and crosscutting are characterized by two key work operations: directed felling and manual collection of the felled wood material. Manual collection is made significantly easier by the correct <b>selection</b> of tree <b>felling</b> direction which in turn affects significantly the rationalization of the entire thinning process...|$|R
30|$|There is no robust method {{developed}} for accurate biomass estimation. Existing methods are having controversies with variable accuracy ranges. Various methods are employed for measuring biomass/carbon include destructive (total harvesting of sample), nondestructive (measurable parameters like basal area, height, tree density), tree inventories data, species-specific biomass estimation, and remote sensing methods (Brown et al.  1989, 1999; Lu 2006; Murali et al. 2005). Absolute measurements of biomass {{can be taken}} up only {{at the time of}} felling which is not possible in all situations (Murali et al. 2005). Measurements for basal area, height, and species-specific gravity in field are good criteria for estimating biomass as nondestructive methods (de Gier 2003). In India, the <b>selection</b> system for <b>felling</b> is followed where only the marked trees are taken out leaving behind the immature/unmarked trees.|$|R

Other influences on student book selection were examined as well. A second area of interest dealt with student attitudes toward reading. ^ Subjects were drawn from the seventh grade literature classes of a junior high school. Students were randomly assigned to one of two groups. At the beginning of the study, 242 students participated; that number was reduced to 233 participants by the end of the four-month study. ^ Whenever students checked out books, they filled out student circulation questionnaires identifying the reasons for selecting those books. Ten <b>selection</b> decisions <b>fell</b> into three groups: librarian influenced decisions, personal recommendations, and 2 ̆ 2 other 2 ̆ 2 reasons.

The study {{took place in}} plantation forest, inhabited by the New Zealand long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus tuberculatus), in which trees are harvested between the ages 26 - 32 years. We determined home ranges by radiotracking different bats in areas that had and had not been recently clear-fell harvested. Home ranges were smaller in areas that had been harvested. Adult male bats selected 20 - 25 year old stands within home ranges before and after harvest. Males selected edges with open unplanted areas when harvest had not occurred but no longer selected these at proportions greater than their availability post harvest, probably because they were then readily available. This is the first radiotracking study to demonstrate a change in home range size and <b>selection</b> concomitant with <b>felling</b> of large areas of plantation forest, and thus quantify negative effects of forestry operations on this speciose group. The use of smaller home ranges post-harvest may reflect smaller colony sizes and lower roost availability, both of which may increase isolation of colonies and vulnerability to local extinction...|$|R
