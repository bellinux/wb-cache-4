40|$|In {{its natural}} environment, the soil {{bacterium}} Bacillus subtilis permanently encounters nutrient limitations {{and increases in}} osmotic stress. The present study investigated the systems-wide response of B. subtilis to different simultaneously imposed stresses by combining chemostat experiments under conditions of carbon and nitrogen limitation, ionic and non-ionic osmotic stress and osmoprotection with multi-omics analyses of the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and fluxome. Surprisingly, the flux through central carbon and energy metabolism is very robust under all conditions studied. The key to achieve this robustness is the increased production of several enzymes of central carbon metabolism to compensate for their reduced activity {{in the presence of}} high salt. A major response of the cell during osmotic stress is the production of the compatible solute proline through the concerted adjustment of multiple reactions around the 2 -oxoglutarate node, which drives metabolism towards the precursor glutamate. Co-regulations between the individual cellular components under the investigated stress conditions indicate that the fine-tuning of the transcriptional and metabolic networks involves functional modules that outreach single pathways. Additionally, the work shortly describes the salinity-decoupled fed-batch production of the compatible solute ectoine in Corynebacterium glutamicum and the contribution of precursor amino acids of the aspartate family. Das Bodenbakterium Bacillus subtilis ist in seiner natürlichen Umgebung permanenten Schwankungen des Nährstoffangebots und osmotischem Stress ausgesetzt. Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht die systemweite Anpassung von B. subtilis an verschiedene, gleichzeitig auftretende Umweltstresse. Dazu wurden Chemostatexperimente, die sowohl Kohlen- und Stickstofflimitierung, als auch osmotischen Stress und Osmoprotektion nachbilden, mit Analysen des Transkriptoms, Proteoms, Metaboloms und Fluxoms kombiniert. Überraschenderweise ist die metabolische Flussverteilung im zentralen Kohlenstoffwechsel unter allen untersuchten Bedingungen sehr rigide. Eine erhöhte Produktion wichtiger Enzyme des zentralen Kohlenstoffwechsels kompensiert deren reduzierte Aktivität in Gegenwart von hohen Salzkonzentrationen im Cytosol. Eine weitere Reaktion der Zelle auf erhöhten osmotischen Stress ist die verstärkte Synthese des kompatiblen <b>Soluts</b> Prolin. Dies wird ermöglicht durch eine abgestimmte Anpassung der Reaktionen bis zum 2 -Oxoglutarat-Knoten, die den Kohlenstofffluss in Richtung des Vorläufers Glutamat treibt.

40|$|La present tesi {{doctoral}} es basa en la síntesi de nous agents de solvatació quiral (CSA) que siguin més eficaços i/o més versàtils que els existents al mercat actual. Per aconseguir aquest objectiu s'han introduït una sèrie de modificacions en les estructures dels CSA més comunament usats, com són l'alcohol de Pirkle i la 1 -(1 -naftil) etilamina, i s'ha avaluat l'efecte que aquests canvis confereixen a les noves molècules pel que fa a la seva capacitat d'acció com a agents de solvatació quiral. Així doncs en aquest treball: - S'han sintetitzat les amines, 1 -adamantil- 9 -(9, 10 -dihidroantril) metilamina i la 1 -(1 -pirenil) etilamina però en cap cas s'ha pogut avaluar la seva capacitat com a agents de solvatació quiral degut a la dificultat per resoldre els seus enantiòmers. - S'han estudiat diverses rutes sintètiques per a l'obtenció del 2, 2, 2 -trifluoro- 1 -(9 -tripticil) etanol. Cap de les vies assajades ha donat lloc a l'alcohol desitjat amb rendiments acceptables. En la síntesi del 2, 2, 2 -trifluoro- 1 -(9 -tripticil) etanol via cicloaddició [4 + 2] el baix rendiment observat s'atribueix a l'electronegativitat del grup trifluorometil. Mentre que en el cas de l'obtenció de l'alcohol en estudi per reacció del 9 -tripticil liti amb anhídrid trifluoroacètic i/o trifluoroacetat d'etil, aquesta no ha tingut lloc degut als impediments estèrics que apareixen en aproximar-se l'anió tripticil als diferents electròfils. - S'ha sintetitzat, amb molt bon rendiment, l'a,a'-bis(trifluorometil) - 10, 10 '-(9, 9 '-biantril) dimetanol i s'han resolt els seus dos diastereoisòmers. S'ha demostrat l'eficàcia d'aquests compost com a CSA davant de diversos <b>soluts</b> quirals, superant en alguns casos i igualant en d'altres la capacitat solvatant de l'alcohol de Pirkle. S'ha determinat l'estequiometria dels complexos de solvatació formats entre l'lcohol en estudi i diferents <b>soluts</b> observant-se una certa tendència a la complexació 1 : 1. S'ha realitzat també estudi sobre la seva constant d'associació (K) a temperatura ambient i a baixa temperatura, d'on s'ha pogut concloure que la K augmenta en disminuir la temperatura. - S'ha aconseguit disposar d'un mètode de síntesi que ens permet obtenir el pirè perdeuterat en quantitats importants i a un cost relativament baix. - S'ha sintetitzat el macrocicle ciclobis[sulfit del (R,R) -a,a'-bis(trifluorometil) - 9, 10 -antracendimetil]. Dades experimentals i càlculs teòrics han coincidit en afirmar que la cavitat que presenta aquest compost és massa petita com per permetre la inclusió de molècules orgàniques. - S'ha obtingut el precursor d'un nou macrocicle, el qual aportarà la mida necessària a la cavitat, per la posterior inclusió de molècules quirals en el seu interior. The present work {{is based}} on the synthesis of new chiral solvating agents which are more efficient and versatile than the ones in the current market. In order to reach this objective a number of modifications have been introduced {{in the structure of the}} common CSA, such as Pirkle's alcohol, and 1 -(1 -naphtyl) ethyilamine, and then been evaluated the effect of these changes in the behaviour of these new compounds as chiral solvating agents. From this work several facts and conclusions can be stated. The amines, 1 -adamanthyl- 9 -(9, 10 -dihydroanthryil) methylamine and the 1 -(1 -pyrenyl) ethylamine, have been synthesized but their capacity as chiral solvating agents could not be evaluated due to the difficulty of resolving their enantiomers. Several synthetic methods to obtain 2, 2, 2 -trifluoro- 1 -(9 -tripticyl) ethanol have been studied. However, none of the routes has developed the expected alcohol efficiently. The synthesis of 2, 2, 2 -trifluoro- 1 -(9 -tripticyl) ethanol via cycloaddition [4 + 2] gives low yieds due to electronegativity of the group trifluoromethyl. On the other hand, the process of obtaining the studied alcohol to reaction of 9 tripticyl litium with trifluoroacteic anhydride and/or ethyl trifluoroacetate, did not work due to the steric effects found in the approach of the litium compound to the electrophil molecules The compound a,a'-bis(trifluorometihy) - 10, 10 '-(9, 9 '-biantrhyl) dimethanol has been synthesized with a very good yield and have been separeted efficiently their diastereomers. The good behaviour of this product as a chiral solvating agent behind several enantiomeric molecules has been demostrated. This alcohol has showed a large capacity to induce chirality in racemic mixtures, which is the same, or sometimes even better than the assiciation capacity of Pirkle's alcohol. The stoichiometry of the association complexes has been determined concluding that the ratio is usually 1 : 1. A study of the equilibrium constant (K) has been carried out and has been demonstrated that K increases when temperature decreases. A synthetic method has been developed to obtain perdeuterio pyrene in quantity and low cost. A macrocycle ciclobis[(R,R) -a,a'-bis(trifluoromethyl) - 9, 10 -anthracendimethyl sulphite]has been synthesized. Experimental results and theoretical calculations coincide to confirm that the cavity created in this molecule is too little to permit the inclusion of any organic compound. A precursor of a new macrocycle has been obtained, which will provide the appropiate size to the cavity in order to be able to include chiral molecules...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{dissolved}} inorganic nitrogen delivered to streams and groundwater has substantially {{increased in the}} last decades due to anthropogenic impacts. This fact has stimulated research on processes related to the nitrogen cycling in order to elucidate the ability of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in controlling nitrogen loads. Some of these studies pointed out during storms streamwater chemistry is significantly altered. However, because of the inherent difficulty of an extensive field experimental setting for dealing with episodic storms, studies focused on hydrological processes or stream solute dynamics during storms rely on a very limited number of events. Hydrobiogeochemical processes have been mainly studied in temperate experimental catchments and {{little attention has been}} paid to Mediterranean catchments. Recent studies have stressed the fragility of Mediterranean regions in front of the global change and because of that Mediterranean regions should become hot spots for present and future studies. The main goal of the present thesis was to study the variability of nutrient dynamics, in particular nitrogen, during stormflow in relation to baseflow conditions in Fuirosos, an intermittent stream draining a small Mediterranean catchment (Part I). As a secondary objective (Part II), solute dynamics in Fuirosos were compared with those measured at one of its main tributaries, the Grimola stream. Biotitic granodiorite was an important fraction of the Fuirosos catchment, whereas the Grimola catchment was underlain by leucogranite. The Fuirosos stream had an alluvial zone and it was flanked by a well developed riparian forest, whereas the Grimola stream had not a significant alluvial zone, neither a well developed riparian area. Thereby, the effect of (i) catchment size, (ii) lithology and (iii) the presence of an alluvial-riparian zone on stream hydrogrochemistry were assessed by comparing the Fuirosos and Grimola streams. The Fuirosos Stream Watershed, a relatively undisturbed Mediterranean ecosystem that can not be considered a N-saturated catchment, leaks to the stream most of the nitrogen loss in the form of nitrate (57 %). This figure contrast with that reported for other pristine tropical and humid catchments where nitrogen export is mainly in the form of dissolved organic nitrogen. In particular, nitrate is mainly mobilized during stormflow conditions (from 52 % to 80 % of the annual yield). Contrastingly, most of the dissolved organic carbon export occurs during baseflow conditions (from 40 to 70 % of the annual yield). These results point to a decoupling between soil nitrification and nutrient uptake by biota, which brings about the leaking of nitrate to the stream. Hydrochemistry in this Mediterranean intermittent stream is highly variable within and in between years. The antecedent moisture conditions and the magnitude of storm events are key factors on shaping the hydrological responses to storm events. However, storm episodes that occur during similar climatological and hydrological conditions produce different streamwater chemistry depending upon the time of the year. This is so, mainly because of the influence of the summer drought period on streamwater chemistry. Both, the mixing model (EMMA) and the spectral analysis approaches, point out that groundwater is the most important contributor to stormflow in Fuirosos. Nonetheless, the EMMA approach emphasizes how stream water and nitrate sources vary throughout the year. Our results stress the importance of sampling storms during all seasons to draw general conclusions about watershed processes. The mixing model shows that nitrate is retained by biota in the Fuirosos alluvial zone only when streamflow is lower than 80 l/s. Above this threshold, the system is not efficient in retaining nitrate arriving from the catchment. This result might be keep on mind when establishing the importance of near- and in-stream processes for regulating catchment nitrate loads since a major fraction of the annual nitrate export usually occurs during stormflow conditions in many catchments. The spectral analysis also shows that the variability of stream nitrate concentrations is more damped in Fuirosos than in Grimola. This is attributed to the buffer effect that biota has on nitrate concentrations in the Fuirosos alluvial zone, which retards its delivery in relation to the Grimola catchment. "Efecte de les pluges en la dinàmica del nitrogen en una riera intermitent i mediterrània" La quantitat de nitrogen dissolt que arriba avui dia als nostres rius i aqüífers és substancialment major a la de fa un parell de dècades a resultes de l'activitat antròpica. Aquest fet ha estimulat força la recerca dels processos relacionats amb el ciclatge del nitrogen, amb la intenció d'esbrinar la capacitat que tenen els ecosistemas terrestres i aquàtics per controlar les càrregues de nitrat que els hi arriben. Alguns d'aquests estudis indiquen que durant les tempestes s'altera de forma substancial la química de l'aigua del riu. Això no obstant, la major part dels treballs realitzats es recolzen en un nombre limitat d'episodis, donada la dificultat inherent al mostreig intensiu de camp a l'hora d'estudiar les respostes hidrològiques i la dinàmica dels <b>soluts</b> durant les crescudes. Tradicionalment, la comunitat científica s'ha dedicat a l'estudi dels processos hidrobiogeoquímics de regions temperades i tropicals, i desafortunadament, les conques Mediterrànies no han estat objecte de la seva atenció. Estudis recents alerten de la fragilitat de les regions Mediterrànies enfront del canvi global, i per tant, urgeixen els estudis focalitzats en aquests ecosistemes. El principal objectiu d'aquesta tesi ha estat l'estudi de la variabilitat de la dinàmica dels nutrients, en particular del nitrogen, durant les crescudes en relació a la seva dinàmica en condicions de cabal basal en una riera intermitent, Fuirosos, en una conca Mediterrània. La hidrologia i la dinàmica dels <b>soluts</b> a la riera de Fuirosos s'ha comparat amb les de la Grimola, un dels seus efluents més importants. Hi ha diferències litològiques notables entre les dues conques. A més la riera de Fuirosos té zona al. luvial i està flanquejada per un bosc de ribera ben desenvolupat, mentre que la riera de Grimola no té zona al. luvial ni tampoc una zona riberenca ben diferenciada. Per tant, els efectes de (i) la mida de la conca, (ii) la litologia, i (iii) la presència d'una zona al. luvial i riberenca sobre la hidrobiogeoquímica d'un riu, van poder ésser contrastats comparant les rieres de Fuirosos i Grimola. L'estudi es va realitzar al Parc Natural del Montnegre-Corredor al Vallès Oriental entre els anys 1998 i 2004. </i...|$|R

The AB-EPD ranged f rom less than 104 to 5 • 105 cm 2, whi le the average dis locat ion densi ty was in the range of 1 - 3 z 10 4 cm- 2.
