5|$|Although {{the custom}} had {{no basis in}} law and {{frequently}} resulted in prosecution, particularly from the mid-19th century onwards, {{the attitude of the}} authorities was equivocal. At least one early 19th-century magistrate is on record as stating that he did not believe he had the right to prevent wife sales, and there were cases of local Poor Law Commissioners forcing husbands to <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> wives, rather than having to maintain the family in workhouses.|$|E
5|$|For {{many centuries}} thereafter, the {{settlements}} around the Mont Blanc massif comprised a rural population of peasant mountain farmers, living off animal husbandry, supplemented with a meagre harvest of rye and oats. Some {{farmers in the}} valley of Chamonix joined their counterparts from the neighbouring valleys of Maurienne, Beaufortain and Tarentaise and crossed the Alps into southern Germany, Austria and northern Italy to <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> products and bring back goods for sale in local markets.|$|E

In the early 20th century, the Percheron {{was one of the}} four major draft horse breeds, along with the Belgian, the Clydesdale and the Shire. Breeders could <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> horses for significant amounts of money, especially in the United States and Canada, where breeding stock brought a premium price.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{businessman}} Mike Ashley {{purchased the}} combined stakes of both Douglas and John Hall, 41% {{share in the}} club, through a holding company St James Holdings, {{with a view to}} buy the rest. Upon purchasing this share, he appointed Chris Mort as chairman, while gaining more shares, owning 93.19% of the club by 29 June 2007. This figure reached 95% on 11 July 2007, forcing the remaining shareholders to <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> shares.|$|E
5|$|In this period, one of {{the major}} {{incentives}} for the growth of Transylvanian towns was the trade with Wallachia and Moldavia. For instance, Braşov was granted a staple right in 1369 with respect to the trade in cloth from Poland or Germany. Thereafter, foreign merchants had to <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> most sought-after merchandise, broadcloth to the tradesmen of Braşov who resold it in Wallachia in exchange for animals, cotton, wax and honey.|$|E

5|$|Most {{conventions}} {{will feature}} {{some kind of}} an art show, in which artists' work is displayed, often for direct purchase or auction during the convention. There will often be a Dealers Den where art and comic book distributors and other merchants can <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> wares for a fee, and an Artists' Alley where individual artists are given space for no fee or a token fee, usually on the condition that they only <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> own work. Artists may also trade art between each other using sketchbooks. Erotic art is typically allowed if kept separate from other pieces, and only shown to adult attendees; a few conventions are rated strictly PG-13. Individual transactions are relatively small (usually around US$10–$50 for sketches or badges, $10–$200 for auction pieces), but the total can approach US$100,000 at the largest events (excluding professional dealers).|$|E
5|$|The Black Hawk War {{gave the}} young captain Abraham Lincoln his brief {{military}} service, although he never {{participated in a}} battle. Other participants who later became famous included Winfield Scott, Zachary Taylor, and Jefferson Davis. The war gave impetus to the U.S. policy of Indian removal, in which Native American tribes were pressured to <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> lands and move west of the Mississippi River and stay there.|$|E
5|$|The {{holding company}} of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, {{is a private}} limited company, with {{approximately}} 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousand small shareholders.|$|E

5|$|The {{price of}} the {{imported}} ice varied according {{to the amount of}} economic competition; in Havana, Tudor's ice sold for 25 cents ($3.70 in 2010 terms) per pound, while in Georgia it reached only six to eight cents ($0.90–$1.20 in 2010 terms). Where Tudor had a strong market share, he would respond to competition from passing traders by lowering his prices considerably, selling his ice at the unprofitable rate of one cent ($0.20) per pound (0.5kg); at this price, competitors would typically be unable to <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> own stock at a profit: they would either be driven into debt or if they declined to <b>sell,</b> <b>their</b> ice would melt away in the heat. Tudor, relying on his local storage depots, could then increase his prices once again. By the middle of the 1820s, around 3,000 tons (3 million kg) of ice was being shipped from Boston annually, two thirds by Tudor.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Beach {{has a large}} {{agribusiness}} sector {{which produces}} $80 million for the city economy.

5|$|After the storm, the National Guard offered {{shelters for}} at least 400homeless {{residents}} in Stuart. Of the 7,900families adversely affected by the hurricane, 4,325required assistance from the American Red Cross. Farmers in Texas, also affected by a major hurricane, requested growers in Florida wait 15days so they could <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> citrus crop that fell. The damaged dam near Tampa initially resulted in waters from the Hillsborough River being pumped into the city's water treatment plant, and a new dam was eventually built in 1944.|$|E

5|$|Although the Croatian {{government}} sponsored reconstruction {{efforts in}} and around Vukovar, the Serb-populated town centre remained in ruins until 2003. Both Croat and Serb residents believed the government had neglected it deliberately, in order to punish the Serb community. Human Rights Watch noted that, of 4,000 homes that had been rebuilt, {{none of them were}} inhabited by Serbs. Unemployment was high because of the destruction of the town's major industries, and many of the inhabitants could not <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> houses. Most houses and many of Vukovar's historic buildings had been restored by 2011.|$|E
5|$|Ascension is {{the only}} {{installment}} in the series to feature online multiplayer for both competitive and cooperative play. Up to eight players on two teams of two to four players (or a four to eight player deathmatch) battle for control of a map in order to earn rewards from the gods. Players can also fight each other in one-on-one matches.

This departure is delayed by a visit from Kioe Lie, who reveals that he will be marrying Tam Bing's widow Tan Houw Nio– Tam Bing having died the year before. Kioe Gie is horrified, both because the widow has the same surname and because Kioe Lie had promised their father on his deathbed to marry Hap Nio. After an extensive argument, Kioe Lie disowns his brother and leaves.|$|E

5|$|French cuisine varies {{according}} to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting season begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate {{the success of the}} hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's {{first major}} {{achievement}} came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were {{backed by the}} local administration. The peasantry was forced to grow Indigo, a cash crop whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.|$|E
5|$|Howe was {{determined}} to support technologically advanced industries, and saw no reason why Canada should not continue to produce aircraft after the war. His Director-General for Aircraft Production, Ralph Bell, disagreed with him, noting that Canada had no aircraft engine manufacturer, and that {{despite the presence of}} manufacturing plants and skilled workers, there was no guarantee that they could <b>sell</b> <b>their</b> products. Nevertheless, Howe took steps to keep aircraft manufacturers in business, allowing the British Hawker Siddeley Group to take over Victory Aircraft as A.V. Roe Canada (Avro Canada), while Canadair was sold to the US-based Electric Boat Company (later General Dynamics).|$|E
