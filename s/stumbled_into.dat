5|$|On January 12, {{the group}} <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> a Miwok camp looking so {{deteriorated}} that the camp's inhabitants initially fled. The Miwoks gave {{them what they}} had to eat: acorns, grass, and pine nuts. After a few days, Eddy continued on {{with the help of a}} Miwok to a ranch in a small farming community at the edge of the Sacramento Valley. A hurriedly assembled rescue party found the other six survivors on January 17. Their journey from Truckee Lake had taken 33days.|$|E
5|$|On {{this same}} road, closer to Yongdong, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry, which {{was trying to}} help the cutoff units of the 8th Cavalry, was itself {{attacked}} by strong North Korean units. Through some error, the US battalion's F Company advanced to the wrong hill and <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> a concentration of North Korean soldiers. Only 26 men from F Company returned, the rest were killed or captured in the subsequent ambush. Altogether, the 5th Cavalry Regiment suffered 275 casualties on July 25.|$|E
5|$|Another probe {{was made}} {{early on the}} morning of 28 March on the {{positions}} of the Australian 5th Field Battery, whose eight guns were located east of Toko, on {{the west bank of the}} Puriata river from where they could provide defensive fires in support of the 25th Infantry Battalion's main positions on the knoll. Shortly before dawn one of the booby traps that the Australians had set around their perimeter to provide early warning was set off and one of the sentries opened fire upon what he believed to be a Japanese probe. A short time later, a small section of Japanese <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> one of the forward positions and fire was exchanged. Later, as a team was sent out to disarm the remaining booby traps, this team was fired upon and sporadic fighting continued until midday.|$|E

5|$|At night, Reshef {{moved with}} his {{remaining}} forces {{north along the}} canal bank. Bypassing the 16th Brigade's positions, the Israelis soon found themselves {{in the center of}} a huge administrative area and vehicle park. Reshef's brigade had <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> the command and supply bases of the Egyptian 16th and 21st Divisions. The base was located near the canal on the assumption that it was the safest location from Israeli attacks, which was expected to come from the east, where the defenses were the strongest, not from the south, where they were the weakest. Both sides immediately opened fire, inadvertently leading to the destruction of supply trucks and SAM launchers. The Egyptians managed to organize a counterattack by units of the 21st Division; a battalion of the 14th Brigade and a battalion (less one company) of the 18th Brigade. The tanks repelled the Israelis, who sustained significant losses from vastly overwhelming opposing forces.|$|E
5|$|Commander Alfred Godsal led {{the assault}} in HMS Brilliant {{and it was}} he who <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> the most {{effective}} German counter-measure first. As Brilliant staggered through the murk, the lookout spotted the buoy ahead and Godsal headed directly for it, coming under even heavier fire as he did so. Passing the navigation marker at speed, the cruiser was suddenly brought to a halt with a juddering lurch, throwing men to the decks and sticking fast in deep mud well outside the harbour mouth. Before warnings could be relayed to the Sirius following up close behind, she too passed the buoy and her captain Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy was shocked to see Brilliant dead ahead. With no time to manoeuvree, Sirius ploughed into the port quarter of Brilliant, the blockships settling into the mud in a tangle of wreckage.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Bean left Brook Comprehensive School with O Levels in Art and English. After {{a job at}} a {{supermarket}} and another for the local council, he started working for his father's firm with a day release at Rotherham College of Arts and Technology to take a welding course. While there, he <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> an art class and decided to pursue his interest in art. After attending courses at two other colleges, one for half a day and the other for less than a week, he returned to Rotherham College, where he subsequently enrolled in a drama course. After some college plays and one at Rotherham Civic Theatre, he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), starting a seven-term course in January 1981.|$|E

5|$|Matt Bissonnette, a SEAL {{who participated}} in the raid, wrote an account of the mission in the book No Easy Day (2012), which {{significantly}} contradicts Pfarrer's account. Bissonnette wrote that the helicopter approach and landing matched the official version. According to Bissonnette, when bin Laden peered out at the Americans advancing on his third-floor room, the SEAL who fired upon him hit him {{on the right side of}} the head. Bin Laden <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> his bedroom, where the SEALs found him crumpled and twitching on the floor in a pool of body matter, with two women crying over his body. The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women, moved them away, and shot bin Laden repeatedly in the chest until he was dead. According to Bissonnette, the weapons in the room—an AK-47 rifle and a Makarov pistol—were unloaded.|$|E
5|$|By 23:30, the High Seas Fleet {{had entered}} its night {{cruising}} formation. The order had largely been inverted, {{with the four}} Nassau-class ships in the lead, followed directly by the Helgolands, with the Kaisers and Königs astern of them. The rear was again brought up by the elderly pre-dreadnoughts; the mauled German battlecruisers were by this time scattered. At around midnight on 1 June, the Helgoland- and Nassau-class ships {{in the center of}} the German line came into contact with the British 4th Destroyer Flotilla. The 4th Flotilla broke off the action temporarily to regroup, but at around 01:00, unwittingly <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> the German dreadnoughts a second time. Helgoland and Oldenburg opened fire on the two leading British destroyers. Helgoland fired six salvos from her secondary guns at the destroyer Fortune before she succumbed to the tremendous battering. Shortly after, Helgoland shifted fire to an unidentified destroyer; Helgoland fired five salvos from her 15cm guns to unknown effect. The British destroyers launched torpedoes at the German ships, but they managed to successfully evade them with a turn to starboard.|$|E
5|$|During {{this second}} tour, Schwarzkopf noted two {{incidents}} which haunted him. On February 17, 1970, {{two men in}} C Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry were killed by friendly fire from an American artillery shell that had been ordered by Schwarzkopf, but which had struck a tree near their position {{on its way to}} a target. The parents of one soldier blamed him for the death of their son, a claim which Schwarzkopf strongly denied and termed an accident of war. On May 28, 1970, Schwarzkopf landed his helicopter when discovering troops of B Company who had <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> a minefield. Two company officers had been wounded and two soldiers were trapped, fearful of setting off more mines. Although a medevac was on its way, Schwarzkopf ordered his UH-1 Huey to remove the wounded. As he attempted to help the troops back out of the field, one soldier struck a landmine, breaking a leg, and began to panic. Fearing he would set off another landmine, Schwarzkopf pinned the soldier to the ground while another soldier put a splint on the wounded man's leg. In doing so, another mine was set off, killing three and wounding Schwarzkopf's artillery officer.|$|E

25|$|That night, Longstreet {{arrived to}} relieve Jackson's troops and {{to renew the}} battle in the morning. The lines were so close that some {{soldiers}} accidentally <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> the camps of the opposing army. The Union army withdrew to Germantown and Fairfax Court House that night, followed {{over the next few}} days by retreating to the defenses of Washington. The Confederate cavalry attempted a pursuit but failed to cause significant damage to the Union army.|$|E

Cittàgazze's reckless use of the technology has released soul-eating Spectres, to which children are immune, rendering {{much of the world}} incapable of transit by adults. Here Lyra meets Will Parry, a twelve-year-old boy from our world.

25|$|The Swedes {{sent out}} two {{reconnaissance}} forces of 180 men each, and a detachment of 20 men {{from one of}} them led by Bonde <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> a unit of 500 men in the front ranks of the Polish army at dusk on 30 July. The unit was attempting to cross the Vistula River. Bonde ordered a sudden charge on the unit that was crossing the river, but it failed and resulted in a massacre due to the large disparity in numbers between the two forces. Later, the remaining 160 cavalrymen in the reconnaissance force repeated the assault on 5,000 crossing Poles without success. However, some cavalrymen were {{able to return to}} alert the rest of the Swedish army.|$|E

25|$|Now the Kandyans {{concentrated}} {{their attack}} on the middle column. After heavy fighting they were repulsed, but this took some time during which the middle column became separated from the vanguard, who were continuing their running battle. In the confusion the elephants carrying Dona Catarina and other valuables, including the ammunition reserves, left the column and wandered into the forest. Meanwhile the advance guard, now proceeding without a guide, took a wrong turn and <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> a marshy field. Here the Kandyans surrounded and overwhelmed them. Following them in, the second column mounted a better resistance, managing to hold out for three hours, but they were eventually annihilated after their captains Henrique Pinto and Diogo Borges were killed.|$|E
25|$|On June 10, 1863, Mosby led 100 men on a raid {{across the}} Potomac River {{to attack the}} Union camp at Seneca, Maryland. After routing a company of the Sixth Michigan Cavalry and burning their camp, Mosby {{reported}} the success to J.E.B. Stuart. This drew Stuart's attention to Rowser's Ford. Mosby had crossed the Potomac there, and during the night of June 27 Stuart's forces would use the same crossing while separated from Lee's army, and thus didn't arrive at Gettysburg until {{the afternoon of the}} second day of the battle. Thus, some analysts claim Lee <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> the battle without his cavalry, partly because of Mosby's successful skirmish at Seneca three weeks earlier.|$|E
25|$|At 4:00 AM on 28 October, Hohenlohe's {{exhausted}} Prussians <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> Schönermark-Nordwestuckermark eight kilometers west of Prenzlau. At {{a council}} of war {{it was determined}} to continue on into Prenzlau. At this time orders were sent to Hagen to make for Pasewalk. The Battle of Prenzlau occurred that day. Murat with Lasalle, Milhaud, Grouchy, Beaumont, and 3,000 of Lannes' infantry intercepted Hohenlohe's column as it marched into the city. Lasalle attacked in front, followed by the two dragoon divisions. On the outskirts, one of Grouchy's brigades hewed {{a path through the}} Prussian column, capturing many prisoners and isolating the rear guard. Beaumont's dragoons drove the rear guard against the Uecker River north of the city and forced Prince Augustus of Prussia to surrender. Though Hohenlohe still had a clear road to Stettin, Murat bluffed him into surrendering 10,000 troops by claiming he was surrounded by 100,000 Frenchmen.|$|E

25|$|Trying {{to follow}} Napoleon's last orders, Junot {{dispatched}} General of Brigade Jean-Jacques Avril and 3,000 troops toward Badajoz. Avril reached the frontier {{to find his}} force faced by a body of artillery-armed Spanish militia behind the Guadiana River. Hearing that Dupont never got beyond Córdoba and that Badajoz was held large numbers of Spanish troops, the French general backtracked to Estremoz in Alentejo Province. On 12 June, General of Division Louis Henri Loison marched east from Almeida in Beira Province with a brigade. He cleared the Spanish garrison from Fort Concepcion and reached the environs of Ciudad Rodrigo. At this time he received intelligence that the city held a considerable garrison, Spain was in revolt, and Bessières was far away. Returning to Almeida on the 15th, he heard that Porto was teetering {{on the edge of}} rebellion. Taking 2,000 men and a few cannons, he set out for Porto but on 21 June <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> a hornet's nest of guerillas who sniped at him and rolled boulders down from the heights. Loison decided that his small force was overmatched and withdrew to Almeida.|$|E
25|$|On 13 November, Saint-Cyr's host <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> Vidreres {{which was}} near the coast road that led to Malgrat de Mar, Mataró, and Barcelona. That evening the Imperial {{soldiers}} saw the campfires of Lazán {{to the north and}} other enemy campfires to the south. But Saint-Cyr knew of a secret path from a Perpignan smuggler; the route connected the coast road with the inland road. Several search parties that were sent out to find the path during the 14th failed to locate it, so Saint-Cyr personally set out with a small escort to find it. In this he was successful, though the group was nearly captured by guerillas and had to fight its way clear. On the 15th the entire Franco-Italian army snaked through the hills, bypassing the small fortress of Hostalric and reaching the inland road at Sant Celoni. At the latter place the Imperial troops scattered a force of miquelets under Milans. Though his men were tired, Saint-Cyr hustled his soldiers along the highway until they reached the dangerous Trentapassos defile which was found to be unoccupied. That evening the Franco-Italians could see a line of campfires ahead of them, indicating the presence of the Spanish army.|$|E
25|$|A relay of German {{reconnaissance}} aircraft observed British waters during the morning, Luftwaffe aircraft flying {{as far north}} as Scotland. Over Yarmouth, a Hurricane was damaged by return fire from a Do17 and then the Dornier was shot down by Douglas Bader of 242 Squadron based at Coltishall. Squadron Leader Peter Townsend, 85 Squadron, baled out near Harwich after being hit by a Do17 belonging to II./KG 2, which returned with three wounded crew. Encouraged by the relative immunity of the Stukas in the morning attack, Hugo Sperrle ordered Luftflotte 3 to follow up the attack; Bf110s from ZG 76 would provide escort in place of the Bf109s. At 11:00 GMT, Hurricanes from 601 Squadron were scrambled to intercept a reconnaissance Do 17, missed it and <b>stumbled</b> <b>into</b> a formation of Ju87s from III./StG 2 escorted by about 40 Bf110s, that radar had failed to locate. The escorts were too high above the Ju87s to stop the first attack. Most squadrons in the Middle Wallop sector were re-fuelling but six 238 Squadron Hurricanes were scrambled, with three more from 501 and 87 Squadrons and nine from 213 Squadron near Exeter. None arrived in time to stop the attack on Portland at 11:53 GMT but little damage was done and only one vessel was damaged.|$|E
