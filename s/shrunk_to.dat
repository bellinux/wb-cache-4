5|$|Groups {{are also}} applied {{in many other}} {{mathematical}} areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying {{the properties of the}} corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups. For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously <b>shrunk</b> <b>to</b> a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being <b>shrunk</b> <b>to</b> a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} approach, the given circles are shrunk or swelled (appropriately to their tangency) until one given circle is <b>shrunk</b> <b>to</b> a point P. In that case, Apollonius' problem degenerates to the CCP , {{which is the}} problem of finding a {{solution}} circle tangent to the two remaining given circles that passes through the point P. Inversion in a circle centered on P transforms the two given circles into new circles, and the solution circle into a line. Therefore, the transformed solution is a line that is tangent to the two transformed given circles. There are four such solution lines, which may be constructed from the external and internal homothetic centers of the two circles. Re-inversion in P and undoing the resizing transforms such a solution line into the desired solution circle of the original Apollonius problem. All eight general solutions can be obtained by shrinking and swelling the circles according to the differing internal and external tangencies of each solution; however, different given circles may be <b>shrunk</b> <b>to</b> a point for different solutions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{development}} {{of nuclear power}} in the United States slowed to a halt, as new plants were cancelled or put on hold. The 1983 financial collapse of the Washington Public Power Supply System, a government agency planning to build five large nuclear power plants throughout the state, and the Three Mile Island accident of 1979 both contributed {{to a decline in}} interest in the university's nuclear program. Student use of the reactor was replaced by commercial use to produce nuclear isotopes for medical use. By 1988, the enrollment in UW's nuclear engineering program <b>shrunk</b> <b>to</b> 23 students, and it was cancelled entirely in 1992.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{initially}} had a garrison {{of eight}} gunners, five soldiers and a lieutenant, {{under the command}} of a captain.

In the 1580s, the castle caught fire and the timber needed for the repairs required 127 trees to be sent from the New Forest. The work was carried out in 1584, prompted by the threat of a Spanish invasion, but by that time its garrison had <b>shrunk</b> <b>to</b> eight men.|$|E

5|$|The {{extension}} of Apollonius' problem to three dimensions, namely, {{the problem of}} finding a fifth sphere that is tangent to four given spheres, can be solved by analogous methods. For example, the given and solution spheres can be resized so that one given sphere is <b>shrunk</b> <b>to</b> point while maintaining tangency. Inversion in this point reduces Apollonius' problem to finding a plane that is tangent to three given spheres. There are in general eight such planes, which become the solutions to the original problem by reversing the inversion and the resizing. This problem was first considered by Pierre de Fermat, and many alternative solution methods have been developed over the centuries.|$|E

5|$|Historically, the Hokies {{have had}} limited success. From 1892 to 1921, Tech competed as a {{football}} independent. The Hokies won several games against larger, better-funded teams during this time, but did not compete in many games outside the American South. From 1921 to 1964, Tech {{was a member of}} the Southern Conference and won the conference championship in 1963. The membership of the Southern Conference fluctuated wildly at times during Tech's tenure. When the conference was created in 1921, it boasted 23 teams. This number was reduced when the Southeastern Conference and Atlantic Coast Conference split away in 1932 and 1953, respectively. By the time Tech won the conference championship in 1963, the conference's membership had <b>shrunk</b> <b>to</b> less than 10 teams. Tech administrators, wanting to expand the football program, chose to leave the conference and become a football independent once more.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, Adriaan van Roomen {{solved the}} problem using {{intersecting}} hyperbolas, but this solution does not use only straightedge and compass constructions. François Viète found such a solution by exploiting limiting cases: {{any of the three}} given circles can be <b>shrunk</b> <b>to</b> zero radius (a point) or expanded to infinite radius (a line). Viète's approach, which uses simpler limiting cases to solve more complicated ones, is considered a plausible reconstruction of Apollonius' method. The method of van Roomen was simplified by Isaac Newton, who showed that Apollonius' problem is equivalent to finding a position from the differences of its distances to three known points. This has applications in navigation and positioning systems such as LORAN.|$|E

5|$|Mass {{transfer}} {{came to an}} {{end when}} the surface layers of the mass-losing star were depleted, and the core slowly <b>shrunk</b> <b>to</b> a white dwarf. Now the stars peacefully orbit around each other. The long-term prospects for PSR B1620-26 b are poor, though. The triple system, which is much more massive than a typical isolated star in M4, is slowly drifting down into the core of the cluster, where the density of stars is very high. In a billion years or so, the triple will probably have another close encounter with a nearby star. The most common outcome of such encounters is that the lightest companion is ejected from the multiple star system. If this happens, PSR B1620-26 b will most likely be ejected completely from M4, and will spend the rest of its existence wandering alone in interstellar space as an interstellar planet.|$|E
5|$|The 107-seater was {{launched}} on 26 April 1999 with the options and orders count at 109 aircraft. After {{three years of}} design, the maiden flight took place at Hamburg on 15 January 2002.

5|$|The Hound Pits pub, {{which acts}} {{as a base for}} the player, was {{initially}} a larger structure.

The pub's exterior was <b>shrunk</b> <b>to</b> resemble an Edwardian building, but the interior remained labyrinthine so Colantonio required that a chain be placed outside Corvo's bedroom, allowing him to reach the roof quickly. In frustration, the designers decided to simply close off the third floor entirely.

5|$|The {{usefulness}} of inversion {{can be increased}} significantly by resizing. As noted in Viète's reconstruction, the three given circles and the solution circle can be resized in tandem while preserving their tangencies. Thus, the initial Apollonius problem is transformed into another problem that may be easier to solve. For example, the four circles can be resized so that one given circle is <b>shrunk</b> <b>to</b> a point; alternatively, two given circles can often be resized {{so that they are}} tangent to one another. Thirdly, given circles that intersect can be resized so that they become non-intersecting, after which the method for inverting to an annulus can be applied. In all such cases, the solution of the original Apollonius problem is obtained from the solution of the transformed problem by undoing the resizing and inversion.|$|E
5|$|As more middle-class and {{affluent}} people {{fled the}} city to the relative quiet and open spaces of the suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population. At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing the average cost of benefits per employee by 1,629percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities. More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had <b>shrunk</b> <b>to</b> 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.|$|E
5|$|Lindow Moss is a {{peat bog}} in Lindow, {{an area of}} Wilmslow, Cheshire, which {{has been used as}} common land since the medieval period. It formed after the last ice age, one of many such peat bogs in {{north-east}} Cheshire and the Mersey basin that formed in hollows caused by melting ice. Investigations have not yet discovered settlement or agricultural activity around the edge of Lindow Moss that would have been contemporary with Lindow Man; however, analysis of pollen in the peat suggests there was some cultivation in the vicinity. Once covering over , the bog has now <b>shrunk</b> <b>to</b> a tenth of its original size. It is a dangerous place; an 18th-century writer recorded people drowning there. For centuries the peat from the bog was used as fuel, and it continued to be extracted until the 1980s, by which time the process had been mechanised. Lindow Moss is a lowland raised mire; this type of peat bog often produces the best preserved bog bodies, allowing more detailed analysis. Lowland raised mires occur mainly in northern England and extend south to the Midlands. Lindow Man is one of 27bodies to be recovered from such areas.|$|E
