In this condition, there is a huge population pressure and ultimately this pressure transfer to agricultural soils to feed such a huge crowd of people. Pakistan is an agriculture country with most of the areas deficient of inherent soil fertility. Because of increasing population, {{there is a need to}} increase the cropping intensity. This increased crop intensity requires fertilizer application, especially of primary macronutrients along with micronutrients. Soils are becoming deficient of K which may be due to either imbalance fertilizer use of ignorance of farmers to use K fertilizer due to escalating fertilizer prices.

Integrated use of organic and inorganic manures may not only satiate {{the need of}} such crops but this may also be an economical and environment friendly nutrient source. A field study was conducted during 2008 and 2009 following RCBD with three replications at Agronomic Research Area, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad. Effects of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) application from separate and integrated organic and inorganic sources on the maize (Zea mays L.) were evaluated. In the first study poultry manure and press mud as organic amendments; and single superphosphate (SSP) as chemical amendment of P were evaluated in different combinations. In the second study composted wheat and rice straws were integrated with the <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> (SOP) {{to be used as}} the K source. Agronomic, physiological and quality parameters were recorded to establish variations in yield associated with integrated use of organo-chemical P and K fertilizers. In both years the mean grain yield was increased up to 7. 48 t ha- 1 and 7. 2 t ha- 1 with the integration of organic and inorganic (25 % poultry manure + 75 % SSP and 25 % composted rice straw + 75 % SOP) amendments for integrated P and K management, respectively. The relationship between grain yield and yield components, in both the studies, was highly significant (P< 0. 05) and positive. In the first study the 5 th treatment (25 % poultry manure + 75 % SSP) out yielded rest of the treatments due to greater total dry matter production that was resulted from more leaf area duration and higher crop growth rate. Regarding application of K from the integrated sources, treatment containing 25 % composted rice straw + 75 % SOP gave maximum total dry matter (1928. 2 g m- 2), higher cumulative leaf area duration (218. 5 days) and mean crop growth rate (29. 01 g m- 2 day- 1). In both studies, there was linear and positive correlation between grain yield and cumulative leaf area duration. Application of 75 % SSP with 25 % poultry manure and 75 % SOP with 25 % composted rice straw in both studies showed maximum uptake of P and K, respectively.

40|$|Rind {{quality is}} {{indispensable}} for the external appearance and marketability of citrus fruit especially for fresh consumption. Among many factors affecting citrus rind quality, tree age {{is the most}} important one, but remains unexplored so far. This study was carried out during 2007 - 11 and comprised of two parts. The first part of study includes the experiments exploring fruit quality in relation to different tree age, canopy position and fruit size. This study also revealed the cell number, cell size, endogenous nutrients and fruit pectin concentrations (rind and rag) in relation to tree age during fruit growth and development. A comparison of fruit quality of different age groups (3 year, 6 year, 18 year, 35 year) showed that fruit obtained from young trees (3 -year-old) were poor in fruit quality such as having more rough rind, rind thickness, rind mass (%) and less juice mass (%), TSS and acidity. Moreover, fruit from young trees had lower rind macro nutrient concentrations (P, Ca) and higher rind micro-nutrient concentrations (Mn and Fe). Fruit in internal canopy position had significantly better fruit quality (smooth rind, less rind thickness, more juice contents) whereas, those in external canopy position were better in biochemical fruit quality such as (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), sugars and ascorbic acid (AA concentrations. Large sized fruit had more rind mass (%), rind thickness, and lower juice mass (%), TSS, TA (%) and TSS:TA ratio during ambient (20 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2 Ã¯Â¿Â½C and 60 65 % RH) and cold storage (4 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 1 Ã¯Â¿Â½C and 75 - 80 % RH) conditions. From nutritional aspects, during fruit growth and development, fruit from sixyear old trees were nutrient deficient in rind (N, P and K), rag and leaf (N) concentrations, while 18 -year-old trees were deficient in rag and leaf nutrient (P, K) concentrations. Pectin analysis showed that fruit from 6 -year-old trees were deficient in rind total pectin, protopectin and rag protopectin concentrations, whereas fruit from 35 -year-old trees were higher in rind water soluble pectin (WSP), total pectin and fruit from 18 -year-old trees were higher in rind total pectin and rind and rag WSP. Anatomical studies of tissues from different age groups demonstrated increased cell number with lower cell size in rind tissue of 6 -yearold trees in comparison with 18 and 35 -year-old trees. Correlation analysis revealed that leaf N contents correlated positively with cell size in fruit from 18 and 35 -year-old trees. Cell size was negatively correlated with rind P concentrations and positively correlated with leaf P concentrations in fruit from all tree age groups. In second part of the study, the potential of exogenous application of PGRs and nutrients were explored in improving fruit quality of young 'Kinnow' orchards. The PGRs like gibberellic acid (GA 3), 2, 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2, 4 -D), putrescine (Put) and spermine (Spm) were applied before and after colour break to young (3 - 4 years old) 'Kinnow' mandarin trees and their influence on fruit quality under ambient (20 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2 Ã¯Â¿Â½C and 60 - 65 % RH) and cold storage (4 Ã¯Â¿Â½ 1 Ã¯Â¿Â½C and 75 - 80 % RH) conditions was determined. Only 2, 4 -D significantly improved TA (%) and TSS:TA ratio during shelflife studies. GA 3 and Put treated fruit exhibited maximum mass loss (%) during shelf studies and cold storage respectively. GA 3 10 mg L- 1 and cytokinins (kinetin and benzyladenine) 30 mg L- 1 applications at fruit setting stage significantly improved juice (%) and reduced rag (%). In nutritional experiments, <b>sulphate</b> <b>of</b> <b>potash</b> (SOP), single super phosphate (SSP), urea, calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN), Wokozim and Isabion were applied to improve fruit quality. Wokozim application reduced rind thickness and improved reducing sugars of fruit, SSP improved juice contents, ascorbic acid (AA) and reduced rind mass (%) although not significant than control;SOP improved AA concentrations in "Kinnow' mandarin juice and CAN improved TSS and AA concentrations. In conclusion, tree age exhibited significant influence on 'Kinnow' mandarin fruit quality as fruit from young trees (3 -years-old) showed inferior fruit quality. Moreover, rind of fruit from young trees had lower macro- (N, P and Ca) and higher micro-nutrient (Mn and Fe) concentrations. In young trees, macronutrients (P and Ca) and micronutrients (Cu, Mn, Fe and Zn) showed a negative correlation with fruit rind thickness. Large sized fruit from all tree age groups exhibited poor quality. Among PGRs, autumn application of 2, 4 -D (10 ppm) to young 'Kinnow' mandarin trees significantly improved TA and TSS:TA ratio. Spring application of cytokinin especially kinetin, among nutrients SSP and CAN and among growth stimulator Wokozim (PGRs and nutrient solution) positively affected fruit physical (rind thickness, total seed, juice, rind and rag mass) and biochemical (TSS, reducing sugars, TA and AA) quality parameters (although some seasonal variations also exist) thus showing their potential for improving fruit quality of young 'Kinnow' mandarin orchards. An improvement in fruit quality of young orchards (3 - 6 years) can help extend the productive window of 'Kinnow' mandarin orchards...|$|E
