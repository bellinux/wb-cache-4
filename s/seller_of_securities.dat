In Chapters 16-19 the author describes the four methods of selling securities: by inside distribution; through Wall Street; through bond and brokerage houses; and by means of advertising. The relative advantages of these various methods are thoroughly discussed and there is much in these chapters which should prove valuable to the buyer {{as well as to the}} <b>seller</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{instrument}} {{used in a}} big way was the bank receipt (BR). In a ready forward deal, securities were not moved back and forth in actuality. Instead, the borrower, i.e. the <b>seller</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities,</b> gave the buyer of the securities a BR. The BR confirms the sale of securities. It acts as a receipt for the money received by the selling bank. Hence the name - bank receipt. It promises to deliver the securities to the buyer. It also states that in the mean time, the seller holds the securities in trust of the buyer.|$|E
5000|$|The Supreme Court's ruling {{reversed}} a {{long history}} of court decisions and SEC enforcement actions where aiders and abettors, often banks, accountants, trustees, and attorneys, were found liable under Rule 10b-5. The case makes the distinction between primary violators, who directly misstate or omit material facts that are relied upon by investors, and aiders and abettors. According to the court: “A plaintiff must show reliance on the defendant's misstatement or omission to recover under 10b-5. Basic Inc. v. Levinson, supra, at 243. Were we to allow the aiding and abetting action proposed in this case, the defendant could be liable without any showing that the plaintiff relied upon the aider and abettor's statement or actions[...] [...] [...]". When investors relied on such statements or actions, the court extends Rule 10b-5 liability to these secondary participants. The Court stated that [...] "any person or entity, including a lawyer, accountant, or bank, who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a purchaser or <b>seller</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> relies may be liable as a primary violator under 10b-5[...] [...]." ...|$|E

40|$|The Ohio Securities Act (“OSA”) {{was enacted}} in 1913 to “guard [] investors against {{fraudulent}} enterprises, to prevent sales <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> {{based only on}} schemes purely speculative in character, {{and to protect the}} public from swindling peddlers of worthless stocks in mere paper corporations. ” The OSA, which is administered by the Ohio Division <b>of</b> <b>Securities</b> (“Division”) and enforced by both the Division and private litigants, regulates the sale and purchase <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> in Ohio. The OSA and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to it by the Division are designed both to encourage compliance by those who might otherwise (intentionally or not) violate the OSA and to provide recourse for those persons who are, despite the Division 2 ̆ 7 s efforts at ensuring compliance, injured by violations of the OSA. The OSA is a remedial law; and, therefore, Ohio courts are bound to construe it in favor of protecting injured buyers and <b>sellers</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities.</b> The protections afforded to purchasers and <b>sellers</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> by the OSA and its companion rules and regulations are supplemented by Ohio common law.

The case of trading errors and losses at state-owned Everbright Securities in 2013 demonstrated the vulnerabilities that may arise when HFT practices are used (Miller & Wildau 2013, Sun 2013).

Some of the distribution agents broke away and began producing their own copies of the Quadro Tracker, such as the Alpha 6, Mole Programmable Substance Detector, Sniffex and GT200.

50|$|Alternative {{trading system}} (ATS) is a US and Canadian {{regulatory}} {{term for a}} non-exchange trading venue that matches buyers and sellers to find counterparties for transactions. Alternative trading systems are typically regulated as broker-dealers rather than as exchanges (although an alternative trading system can apply to be regulated as a securities exchange). In general, for regulatory purposes an alternative trading system is an organization or system that provides or maintains a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and <b>sellers</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities,</b> but does not set rules for subscribers (other than rules {{for the conduct of}} subscribers trading on the system). An ATS must be approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is an alternative to a traditional stock exchange. The equivalent term under European legislation is a multilateral trading facility (MTF).|$|R

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{differences}} between the two structures. A repo is technically a single transaction whereas a sell/buy back is a pair of transactions (a sell and a buy).A sell/buy back does not require any special legal documentation while a repo generally requires a master agreement to be in place between the buyer and seller (typically the SIFMA/ICMA commissioned Global Master Repo Agreement (GMRA)). For this reason there is an associated increase in risk compared to repo. Should the counterparty default, the lack of agreement may lessen legal standing in retrieving collateral. Any coupon payment on the underlying security during the life of the sell/buy back will generally be passed back to the buyer <b>of</b> the <b>security</b> by adjusting the cash paid at the termination of the sell/buy back. In a repo, the coupon will be passed on immediately to the <b>seller</b> <b>of</b> the <b>security.</b>|$|R
40|$|Normal backwardation, first {{discussed}} by Keynes (1923), (1930) and Hicks (1946), is a fee paid by a <b>seller</b> <b>of</b> a <b>security</b> to the buyer {{for the privilege}} of deferring delivery. It implies that a risk premium exists so that the futures price falls short of the expected future spot price. The reverse case, ‘contango’, implies that the futures price exceeds the expected future spot price. This paper applies tests for the existence of normal backwardation to daily closing prices on the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE), London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) and the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX). By applying a series of tests after Kolb’s (1992) study of US commodities, it is found that few of the contracts studied consistently exhibit normal backwardation while many show evidence of contango...|$|R
25|$|In 1950, when a {{brokerage}} firm {{had tried to}} compel arbitration with an investor alleging his broker left him holding the bag in a pump and dump scheme, the case had gone {{all the way to}} the Supreme Court.

Swan that three provisions <b>of</b> the <b>Securities</b> Act <b>of</b> 1933 (or, the 1933 Act), which regulates the primary market in which securities issuers sell directly to buyers, were controlling, allowing investors to take their claims to court regardless of what contracts and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) said. It found that the language in the 1933 Act voiding any waiver of any provision of the statute was broad enough to cover arbitration clauses, and deduced congressional preference for the courts in language that allowed a special cause of action where the burden of proof was on the <b>seller</b> <b>of</b> the <b>security</b> to show that they were unaware of the dubious nature <b>of</b> the <b>security</b> sold, and allowed buyers to sue in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction.|$|R
50|$|Rehypothecation can be {{involved}} in repurchase agreements, commonly called repos. In a two-party repurchase agreement, one party sells to the other a security at a price with a commitment to buy the security back {{at a later date}} for another price. Overnight repurchase agreements, the most commonly used form of this arrangement, comprise a sale which takes place the first day and a repurchase that reverses the transaction the next day. Term repurchase agreements, less commonly used, extend for a fixed period of time that may be as long as three months. Open-ended term repurchase agreements are also possible. A so-called reverse repo is not actually any different to a repo; it merely describes {{the opposite side of the}} transaction. The <b>seller</b> <b>of</b> the <b>security</b> who later repurchases it is entering into a repurchase agreement; the purchaser who later re-sells the security enters into a reverse repurchase agreement. Notwithstanding its nominal form as a sale and subsequent repurchase <b>of</b> a <b>security,</b> the economic effect of a repurchase agreement is that of a secured loan.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] “Lawyers {{who make}} their living {{representing}} securities issuers face a myriad <b>of</b> challenges. <b>Securities</b> lawyers must navigate and master an intricate body of statutory, regulatory, and case law at {{both the state and}} the federal level and ensure that their clients comply with the law. The compliance requirement, however, {{is not limited to the}} issuer clients. Defrauded investors will often seek recovery of their losses from both the issuer of the failed investment securities and from the lawyers who represent the issuer, which only exacerbates the complexity <b>of</b> the <b>securities</b> lawyer’s work. These securities fraud actions against lawyers raise serious questions about the proper scope of liability under the federal securities laws. Just as lawyers strive for clarity, consistency, and predictability in advising their clients on securities compliance issues, lawyers seek the same level of precision regarding their own compliance. … The Court has never directly addressed the issue of attorney liability under section 10 (b) of the 34 Act and Rule 10 b- 5. However, the Court’s recent pronouncements on primary liability of secondary actors under Rule 10 b- 5 indicate that the standard for such liability is increasingly becoming one that attorneys acting in the traditional role of adviser and draftsperson to securities issuers will not satisfy. This development does not give lawyers unbridled freedom or authority to commit securities fraud without fear of sanction, nor does it undermine the 34 Act’s purpose of insuring fairness and honesty in the securities markets. On the contrary, protecting lawyers who lend their expertise to the issuers and <b>sellers</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> is consistent with insuring such fairness and honesty. Moreover, existing rules and standards governing attorney conduct and the concomitant penalties for violation of those rules provide the appropriate level of regulation for lawyers, and this article does not suggest otherwise. The article argues only that section 10 (b) and Rule 10 b- 5 are inappropriate and, in most cases, inapposite means of redressing attorney misconduct in connection with a fraudulent securities transaction. Part II of this article will provide some background on section 10 (b) and Rule 10 b- 5 and will discuss how section 10 (b) and Rule 10 b- 5 have been applied in the area of liability of outside service providers such as lawyers and other secondary actors. In addition, part II will review the most recent developments of the law in this area and discuss how these developments provide an increased level <b>of</b> protection for <b>securities</b> lawyers. Part III of this article will examine how other areas of federal and state law have addressed the issue of attorney liability and suggest that the concepts can be applied to the section 10 (b) and Rule 10 b- 5 analysis. Part IV will briefly discuss the role <b>of</b> the <b>securities</b> lawyer and the influence of the market for legal services on the manner in which these lawyers sell their services to potential clients. The article will then argue that the potential liability of any person under section 10 (b) and Rule 10 b- 5 must be defined in terms of conduct and not in terms of the person’s role in the particular transaction giving rise to the claim. That framework will permit the securities lawyer to more effectively fulfill his or her role because the standard for attorney liability in a private action under section 10 (b) and Rule 10 b- 5 will be clearer. ...|$|R
