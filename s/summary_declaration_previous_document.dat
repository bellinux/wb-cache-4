40|$|The thesis {{targeted}} on {{the area}} of modernization of customs clearance in the EU and the Czech Republic {{is focused on the}} specification of the systems and procedures used in the modernization of customs clearance when the electronic customs declaration is used. Mainly about the status of transition from the paper declaration to the electronic paperless customs declaration, not only in the Czech Republic but throughout the European Union. Assessment data is carried out primarily for the period between the years 2012 to 2014, in some cases, for better assessments, in the period between the years 2009 to 2014. The thesis is focused on the evaluation of the situation with modernisation the customs clearance in the Czech Republic and comparing the results between chosen EU member states and the Czech Republic. The usage of the electronic Entry <b>Summary</b> <b>Declarations</b> and Exit <b>Summary</b> <b>Declarations</b> have increased several times in last two years. Implementation of systems for lodgement and processing of customs declarations for more effective and efficient control of goods within the EU member states has also very fast growing trend with very low error rate. The rate of electronically lodged customs declarations is reaching in most of the EU member states almost 100 %. Numbers of customs declarations lodged within the simplified procedures in chosen EU member states is more or less stable.

This paper presents an IT infrastructure to capture so-called upstream data that allows customs to match delivery - with container data. It proposes Semantic Web technology for secure, global trade, with a gradual migration strategy of all stakeholders. In its final stage, only export and import declaration based on commercial documents is required; all other data can be captured by various authorities for risk analysis.

40|$|Legal {{document}} drafting is {{an essential}} professional skill for attorneys and judges. To maintain stylistic and substantive consistency and decrease drafting time, new documents are often created by modifying <b>previous</b> <b>documents.</b> This paper proposes a framework for document reuse based on an explicit representation of the illocutionary and rhetorical structure underlying documents. Explicit representation of this structure facilitates (1) interpretation of <b>previous</b> <b>documents</b> by enabling them to "explain themselves," (2) construction of documents by enabling document drafters to issue goal-based specifications and rapidly retrieve documents with similar intentional structure, and (3) maintenance of multi-generation documents. The applicability of this framework to a representative class of judicial orders [...] - jurisdictional show-cause orders [...] -is demonstrated. 1 Introduction Legal problem solving subsumes a number of distinct tasks, including analysis of the legal consequences of actual o [...] ...|$|R

Introduction In a <b>previous</b> <b>document</b> [RKB 99], we have defined the implications and requirements of taxonomic work, and reviewed the existing database technology in order to find which currently available model support most of the necessary features of taxonomic work. Taxonomic data is essentially hierarchical, required a lot of freedom, and necessitates the extraction of information by graph traversing techniques. We have shown that no model supports fully taxonomic data and taxonomic processes. The most promising model was the graph model, although it lacked many features we require. However, since this [...] ...|$|R

These changes have been sufficiently substantive to warrant review to determine whether any changes in the recommended treatment algorithms are needed. A consensus development conference was held in January 2007, and the present document highlights the results of the presentations and discussion about these issues. It reviews the epidemiology of hepatitis C in Canada, treatment of acute hepatitis C and new algorithms in chronic hepatitis C, including retreatment of previous treatment failures. In addition, sections on management of hepatitis C in special populations have been updated. There is also a section on the use of hematopoietic growth factors to help manage patients on therapy.
