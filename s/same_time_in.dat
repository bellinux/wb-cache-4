5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} <b>same</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E

5|$|After this transfer, {{the roadway}} carried the CR492 designation. In 1964, several {{abandoned}} underground mine shafts collapsed underneath M-35 in Negaunee, and M-35 was rerouted {{out of the}} city along its current roadway through Negaunee Township, connecting with CR492. The eastern end of CR492 was moved by 2001. Before this realignment, CR492 followed Brookton Road, parallel to US41/M-28 before turning to the previous terminus just west of the border between Marquette Township and the City of Marquette. After the change, CR492 turned north to intersect the highway opposite of Wright Street. The CR492 designation was extended along Wright Street at the <b>same</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> 2006, the city of Marquette extended Wright Street to end at Lakeshore Boulevard.|$|E

5|$|At the <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>in</b> {{accordance}} with the political strategy, Minh's junta was reluctant to carry out large-scale offensives, which concerned the Americans, particularly Harkins, Taylor and CIA chief John McCone. While Harkins and Taylor had opposed Diệm's ouster, the junta's policies also disappointed many supporters of the anti-Diệm coup as they saw regime change as necessary to their hopes of a more aggressive anti-communist war. For their part, Minh's leadership group believed that a more low-key military approach was needed for their political campaign against the insurgency.|$|E
5|$|Countershading is {{less often}} used for {{military}} camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that showed its effectiveness. English zoologist Hugh Cott encouraged the use of techniques including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities. Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting {{as a kind of}} invisibility cloak, and they had to be taught to look at camouflage practically, from the enemy observer's point of view. At the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> Australia, zoologist William John Dakin advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.|$|E
