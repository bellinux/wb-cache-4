40|$|Knowledge of the {{residual}} stress state in wheels resulting from manufacturing and subsequent <b>service</b> <b>loading</b> is useful for several practical reasons. The ability to estimate residual stress levels permits the tuning of manufacturing processes to control the magnitude and distribution of these stresses in new wheels {{in order to achieve}} safe performance in service. Similarly, understanding the redistribution of residual stresses following application of <b>service</b> <b>loads</b> (wheel/rail contact and thermal stresses) is crucial to avoid operating conditions which may lead to premature wheel failure. Axisymmetric (2 -dimensional) analyses are typically performed in order to conduct manufacturing process simulations since these processes affect the entire wheel in a circumferentially uniform sense. Generally, analyses involving <b>service</b> <b>loading</b> have sought to identify the “shakedown state ” at which {{the residual}} stress distribution stabilizes after some number of loading cycles. In order to properly account for <b>service</b> <b>loads,</b> 3 -dimensional models are required since contact and brake shoe thermal loading are not axisymmetric. Since the as-manufactured residual stress distribution must be considered in a <b>service</b> <b>loading</b> simulation, 3 -dimensional modeling of this process is required. This paper presents a preliminary comparison of 2 -and 3 -dimensional modeling of the wheel heat treatment process. Except for the increased computational time required for the 3 -dimensional analysis, the results agree favorably. The 3 -dimensional model is used to simulate <b>service</b> <b>loads</b> involving wheel-rail contact loading representative of a typical passenger car. The model is exercised with a variety of material models for comparison with previous work. Results are presented for multiple loading scenarios and shakedown stress states are established for a range of applied loads...|$|R

The two most common limit states used in soil nail wall design is strength limit and service limit states. The strength limit state is the limit state that addresses potential failure mechanisms or collapse states of the soil nail wall system. The service limit state is the limit state that addresses loss of service function resulting from excessive wall deformation and is defined by restrictions in stress, deformation and facing crack width under regular service conditions. The two most common design approaches for soil nail walls are limit state design and <b>service</b> <b>load</b> design.|$|E
