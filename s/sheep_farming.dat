Although both beef and dairy cattle are raised widely, especially in Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire, Wales is more well known for its <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> and thus lamb is the meat traditionally associated with Welsh cooking.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> for {{the wool}} trade came to {{dominate}} the economy of Exmoor. The wool was spun into thread on isolated farms and collected by merchants to be woven, fulled, dyed and finished in thriving towns such as Dunster. The land started to be enclosed and from the 17th century onwards larger estates developed, leading to establishment of areas of large regular shaped fields. During this period a Royal Forest and hunting ground was established, administered by the Warden. The Royal Forest was sold off in 1818.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{government}} encouraged {{farmers to}} raise sheep throughout the 19th-century. Sheep-rearing programs began to import Yorkshire, Berkshire, Spanish merino, and numerous Chinese and Mongolian sheep breeds, encouraged by government promotion of <b>sheep</b> <b>farming.</b> However, {{a lack of}} knowledge on the farmer's part of how to successfully keep sheep, and the government's failure to provide information to those importing the sheep they promoted, led to the project's failure, and in 1888 it was discontinued.|$|E

Risk factors {{were identified by}} univariate, multivariate logistic regression, and multivariate multilevel analyses. In dairy and non-dairy <b>sheep</b> <b>farm</b> residents, seroprevalence was 66 · 7 % and 51 · 3 %, respectively. Significant risk factors were cattle contact, high goat density near the <b>farm,</b> <b>sheep</b> supplied from two provinces, high frequency of refreshing stable bedding, farm started before 1990 and presence of the Blessumer breed. Most risk factors indicate current or past goat and cattle exposure, with limited factors involving sheep.

5|$|The {{history of}} the domesticated sheep goes back to between 11000 and 9000 BC, and the {{domestication}} of the wild mouflon in ancient Mesopotamia. Sheep are among the first animals to have been domesticated by humans, and {{there is evidence of}} <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> in Iranian statuary dating to that time period. These sheep were primarily raised for meat, milk, and skins. Woolly sheep began to be developed around 6000 BC in Iran, and cultures such as the Persians relied on sheep's wool for trading. They were then imported to Africa and Europe via trading.|$|E
5|$|During the 13th century, {{agricultural}} land {{around the town}} was acquired by Fountains and Furness Abbeys. The latter, already prosperous from the wool trade, wished to expand its <b>sheep</b> <b>farming,</b> and in 1208 bought large tracts of land from Alice de Romilly. She also negotiated with Fountains Abbey, to which she sold Derwent Island in Derwentwater, land at Watendlath, the mill at Crosthwaite and other land in Borrowdale.

5|$|There is {{evidence}} of human occupation from the Mesolithic. This developed for agriculture and extraction of mineral ores into the bronze and Iron Ages. The remains of standing stones, cairns and bridges can still be identified. The royal forest was granted a charter in the 13th century, however foresters who managed the area were identified in the Domesday Book. In the Middle Ages <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> was common with a system of agistment licensing the grazing of livestock as the Inclosure Acts divided up the land. The area is now used {{for a range of}} recreational purposes.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century farming {{became less}} {{economic}} when {{construction of the}} reservoirs reduced the amount of agricultural land in the village. The weaving industry was mechanised, small mines closed and the population declined further when properties in the village were demolished in the early 20th century. Agriculture, mainly <b>sheep</b> <b>farming,</b> continues although on a small scale. Tourism at Rivington began in Victorian times and after the reservoirs were filled in the 1860s {{was known as the}} Little Lake District. Rivington became a popular destination when Lever Park opened in 1904. From the late Victorian period until the mid-20th century tourists from Bolton travelled on day trips by tram along Chorley New Road and then on to Rivington on foot, many more visitors arrived by train.|$|E
5|$|One {{result of}} these changes were the Highland Clearances, by which much of the {{population}} of the Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for <b>sheep</b> <b>farming.</b> The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the UK, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, or further afield to England, Canada, America or Australia. Many that remained were now crofters, living on very small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals. For these families kelping, fishing, spinning of linen and military service became important sources of additional revenue. Scotland suffered its last major subsistence crisis, when the potato blight that caused the Irish potato famine reached the Highlands in 1846. Some 150,000 people whose food supply was mainly potatoes faced disaster. They were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland, but the danger of starvation remained into the 1850s.|$|E

5|$|This period saw {{a process}} of {{rehabilitation}} for Highland culture. In the 1820s, {{as part of the}} Romantic revival, tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe, prompted by the popularity of Macpherson's Ossian cycle and then Walter Scott's Waverley novels. However, the Highlands remained very poor and traditional. The desire to improve agriculture and profits led to the Highland Clearances, in which much {{of the population of the}} Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for <b>sheep</b> <b>farming.</b> The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. One result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, or further afield to England, Canada, America or Australia. The population of Scotland grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901. Even with the development of industry there were not enough good jobs. As a result, during the period 1841–1931, about 2 million Scots migrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, 76–77 {{per cent}} of output by value was {{livestock}} farming and, although this {{has fallen to}} about 64 per cent since 1990, arable farming remains {{a minority of the}} sector and two-thirds of agricultural land is rough pasture. One result is that chemicalisation and arable-based subsidies have had less impact on Scottish biodiversity than is the case in England where farming is overwhelmingly arable. The UK membership of the European Economic Community (later the European Union) in 1972 began a re-orientation for Scottish farming. A preference for Commonwealth markets was replaced by EU obligations. Agriculture became dominated by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU, which made farming dependent on market support and direct grants to farmers. As a result, some sectors, particularly hill <b>sheep</b> <b>farming,</b> became viable only with subsidies. Eight-four per cent of Scottish land qualified for extra support as a Less Favoured Area (LFA), but 80 per cent of the payments were going to only 20 per cent of the farmers, mainly large commercial arable farms in the Lowlands. A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. As part of an attempt to mitigate the depopulation and commercialisation of Scottish farming, the Crofting Act of 1976 made it easier for crofters to buy their farms, but most were insufficient to support a family, and many small farmers turned to fish farming and tourism to supplement their incomes. A dual farm structure has emerged with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings. Scotland has the highest average farm size in the European Union, almost ten times the average.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} revolution {{changed the}} traditional system of agriculture which had existed in Lowland Scotland. Thousands of cottars and tenant farmers migrated from farms and smallholdings {{to the new}} industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh and northern England. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), Highland landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society. Whereas rents had often been paid in kind, the landlords turned to money rents. They displaced farmers to raise sheep and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. This was exacerbated after the repeal of the Corn Laws in the mid-nineteenth century, when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production. One result of these changes was the Highland Clearances, by which much of the population of the Highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for <b>sheep</b> <b>farming.</b> The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the United Kingdom, but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing, the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system, and the brutality of many evictions. The result was a continuous exodus from the land—to the cities, and further afield to England, Canada, America and Australia. The potato famine of the 1840s, caused by potato blight, which devastated the population of Ireland, reached the Highlands in 1846. Although 150,000 people faced disaster, because their food supply was largely potatoes (with a little herring, oatmeal and milk), they were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in dramatic contrast to the failures of relief in Ireland and prevented a major demographic crisis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper was to make a study as regards the {{typology}} of <b>sheep</b> <b>farms</b> which practicing the conventional breeding system. To characterize the typology of conventional <b>sheep</b> <b>farms</b> a study of the production system was conducted in 2014 in 10 <b>sheep</b> <b>farms,</b> located in the counties Cluj, Caras-Severin, Covasna, Buzau, Prahova and Teleorman. Evaluation of the production system from each farm was based on the completion of a specific questionnaire to this type of evaluation. The results showed that conventional <b>sheep</b> <b>farms</b> taken in study are diverse in terms of number of animals held and land used, the average size of <b>sheep</b> <b>farm</b> being by 313. 6 heads (with limits between 105 and 720 heads), and the average area of land used per farm is 90. 02 ha (with limits between 4. 32 and 201. 5 ha). The maintenance system of animals from these farms is extensive or semi-intensive, mainly based on the maintenance of sheep to pasture in warmer seasons and maintenance in shelters in cold season. The direction of sheep breeding in these farms is mixed, respectively for milk and meat. The main problems faced by farmers are related to the lack of market for their products, low prices for sheep products (especially for wool), delay of subsidies, lack of agricultural consultancy and workforce...|$|R

25|$|Farming, and in {{particular}} <b>sheep</b> <b>farming,</b> has been the major industry in the region since Roman times. The breed most {{closely associated with the}} area is the tough Herdwick, with Rough Fell and Swaledale sheep also common. <b>Sheep</b> <b>farming</b> remains important both for the economy of the region and for preserving the landscape which visitors want to see.

25|$|<b>Sheep</b> <b>farming</b> {{introduced}} in the late 19th century has been a principal economic activity. After reaching its heights during the First World War, the decline in world wool prices affected <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> in Argentina. Nowadays about half of Argentina's 15 million sheep are in Patagonia, a percentage that is growing as <b>sheep</b> <b>farming</b> disappears in the Pampa (to the North). Chubut (mainly Merino) is the top wool producer with Santa Cruz (Corriedale and some Merino) second. <b>Sheep</b> <b>farming</b> revived in 2002 with the devaluation of the peso and firmer global demand for wool (led by China and the EU). Still there is little investment in new abbatoirs (mainly in Comodoro Rivadavia, Trelew and Rio Gallegos), and often there are phytosanitary restrictions to the export of sheep meat. Extensive valleys in the Cordilleran range have provided sufficient grazing lands, and the low humidity and weather of the southern region make raising Merino and Corriedale sheep common.|$|E
