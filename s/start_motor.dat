50|$|A {{capacitor}} <b>start</b> <b>motor</b> is a split-phase {{induction motor}} with a starting capacitor inserted {{in series with}} the startup winding, creating an LC circuit which produces a greater phase shift (and so, a much greater starting torque) than both split-phase and shaded pole motors.|$|E
50|$|The motor which {{drives the}} fan {{and the oil}} pump is usually a {{capacitor}} <b>start</b> <b>motor.</b> It is a vortex shortage tank motor because it also contains a short cage or cage holds. The difference with a three-phase motor is in the stator. Where the vortex power motor has three coils aligned at 120° in the stator, the capacitor <b>start</b> <b>motor</b> holds one main winding and one auxiliary winding aligned at 90°. The phase shift of 90° between the main winding and the auxiliary winding is achieved by a connected capacitor which feeds the auxiliary winding and is connected on the single-phase AC mains. The capacitor will achieve a phase shift of 90° between the main and the auxiliary winding, producing an acceptable initial torque. This motor is intended for continuous operation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Compression {{pressure}} of individual cylinder and valve timing have big influence on combustion pressure, indicated {{mean effective pressure}} (IMEP), emission, vibration, combustion noise and many other combustion parameters. Therefore, uniformity of compression pressure and valve timing became one of most important engine design and production standard. Conventional method to evaluate compression pressure uniformity is to measure each cylinder pressure by mechanical pressure gage during cranking. This conventional method causes inaccuracy of cylinder pressure measurement because of different cranking speed results from battery status and also causes high manhour and cost. To check valve timing, related FEAD parts should be disassembled and timing mark should be checked manually. This study describes and suggests new methodology to measure compression pressure by analysis of <b>start</b> <b>motor</b> current and to check valve timing by cylinder pressure with high accuracy.
