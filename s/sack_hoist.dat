25|$|Gears {{inside a}} {{windmill}} convey {{power from the}} rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between {{the front and rear}} bearing. It has the brake around the outside of the rim and teeth {{in the side of the}} rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In grist mills, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> or other machinery.|$|E
500|$|The {{stone floor}} {{is where the}} two pairs of underdrift French Burr {{millstones}} are located. The stones are [...] and [...] diameter. The wooden crown wheel is located towards the ceiling. This drives the <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> on the bin floor. Other machinery on this floor are an oat crusher and a flour dresser.|$|E
50|$|The term {{layshaft}} originates with watermill machinery. The layshaft is the gear-carrying shaft {{that links}} the wallower (the small spur gear driven at increased speed by the waterwheel) to any upright shafts that carry the millstones. The term, layshaft, {{was also used}} by millwrights, in both wind- and watermills, {{to refer to a}} shaft that drove secondary machinery such as <b>sack</b> <b>hoists,</b> rather than the main milling machinery.|$|R
50|$|The tunnel had {{electric}} lighting along its whole length, powered by electricity from the chapel. This allowed the tunnellers {{to see what}} they were doing and signal the arrival of sentries. The entrance to the tunnel in the wine cellar was concealed by five large stones covering a small door, which left little trace of any hole. Debris was transported in <b>sacks</b> <b>hoisted</b> up the clock tower to the castle's attics. The wine cellar was regularly cleaned and redusted using dust harvested from the attic, so as to hide the reddish clay dust which was not present in the cellar ordinarily.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mail! mail! mail!" [...] {{such was}} the welcome cry which rang through the Brooklyn, several days after the {{bombardment}} just described. The news caused a commotion, and all who could rushed on deck and peered eagerly over the side as several heavy mail <b>sacks</b> were <b>hoisted</b> on board. Hardly anybody could wait for the mail to be distributed.|$|R
500|$|New oak joists {{were laid}} on the dust floor and {{temporary}} boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs {{to the top of}} the mill tower. The bin floor was removed, apart from one oak main beam which was repairable. A replacement main beam was made from pitch pine, and the oak beam was repaired. New oak joists were fitted, along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused. One of these had previously been a whip from a Common sail. Some of the joists were made from pitch pine from the Eastbridge Windpump, which, following its collapse on 19 February 1977, had been re-erected at the Museum of East Anglian Life, Stowmarket. [...] The <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> was dismantled to enable its repair, brickwork was repaired, and new lintels were made for some of the windows. A tarpaulin was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter. The floorboards on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of millstones was removed.|$|E
2500|$|Bardwell Mill is a four storey tower mill. The beehive cap is winded by a fantail. When fitted, {{the four}} double Patent sails have {{a span of}} [...] and are carried on a cast iron windshaft which was cast in 1989 (the {{original}} windshaft in the mill was cast in two pieces). The brake wheel is wood, driving a cast iron wallower carried on a wooden upright shaft. The wooden great spur wheel drives two pairs of overdrift millstones. A wooden crownwheel on the upright shaft drives a <b>sack</b> <b>hoist.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The elm Upright Shaft was [...] long It {{carried a}} {{cast-iron}} Wallower [...] diameter Wallower, cast in halves and having 26 teeth. It replaced an earlier wooden wheel.The {{underside of the}} wallower had a friction ring which drove the <b>sack</b> <b>hoist.</b> At {{the foot of the}} Upright Shaft, a wooden clasp arm Great Spur Wheel of [...] diameter with 70 cogs was carried. This drove the two pairs of millstones underdrift. The French Burr stones were driven by a stone nut with 20 cogs, and the Peak stones were driven by a stone nut with 18 cogs. Each pair of millstones was controlled by its own governor, missing {{at the time of the}} survey in 1952.|$|E
50|$|Despite initial successes, the Lancasterian {{schools were}} criticized for poor {{standards}} and harsh discipline even by contemporary standards. Although Lancaster had rejected corporal punishment, misbehaving children might find themselves {{tied up in}} <b>sacks,</b> or <b>hoisted</b> above the classroom in cages. The poet Robert Southey noted that, despite his opposition to corporal punishment, he would rather be beaten than subjected to Lancasterian discipline.|$|R
5000|$|The {{watermill}} {{is early}} 19th century. Owned by Molesworths, a miller was employed, {{who was responsible}} for controlling the water level of the sluice and the working of the mill. In addition, his duties covered management of the Railway Hotel. After the closure of the adjoining mill, trade at the hotel decreased and it was forced to close in the 1930s. Prior to 1910, flour had mainly been milled, and [...] <b>sacks</b> were <b>hoisted</b> to the second floor for storage and lowered to carts below when required. When the steam-driven mill was installed in 1910, the mill concentrated on offals; this consisted of split beans, split maize, kibbled wheat (lightly rolled for chickens) and barley meal. Gleaners from the fields took their grist at harvest to the mill to make barley meal for their home-fed pig. Wheat was frailed (flailed) at home with two long poles with leather thongs, this having to take place when there was a high wind, in order that the chaff should blow away. Some gleaners frailed with a five-pronged fork.|$|R
50|$|Goree Carter {{was born}} in Houston, Texas. He {{was born in}} the Fifth Ward, and lived at 1310 Bayou Street. He began playing blues music at the age of 12, and learnt to play on a cousin's guitar. Because there were very few guitarists in his area back then, he had no one to teach him how to play the guitar, so he taught himself how to play it by {{listening}} to some of his favorite records on a Victrola machine and picking string-by-string on the guitar. He learnt a few chords from listening and then learnt more about them from a chord book. When he became a teenager, he began earning a living by <b>hoisting</b> <b>sacks</b> at the local Comet Rice Mill. He had a Gibson guitar and began fronting bands in his early teenage years.|$|R
2500|$|The four patent sails are now {{carried by}} {{traditional}} wooden stocks. When the mill was restored in the 1950s, the Dutch [...] millwright Christiaan Bremer of Adorp, Groningen was employed, {{and he made}} the stocks in the Dutch style. Although these stocks served the mill for over forty years, they did not represent Kentish practice and were not {{in accordance with the}} Code of Practice of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings [...] covering mill restoration and repair. The stocks pass through the canister on the cast-iron windshaft, and this carries the brake wheel. The brake wheel drives the wallower, {{at the top of the}} upright shaft, and a <b>sack</b> <b>hoist.</b> At the bottom of the upright shaft is the great spur wheel, which drove three pairs of millstones, of which two remain. These are driven overdrift. A crown wheel drove auxiliary machinery.|$|E
2500|$|The site of this mill {{is marked}} by Water Mill Wharf, north of the railway bridge. It belonged to Temple Strood Manor and in the mid-fourteenth century {{contained}} [...] "two water mills under one roof". An engraving by S & N Buck dated 1721 shows the mill, and it appears in [...] "A Distant View of Rochester and Chatham" [...] by Joshua Farington, RA, in 1790. A sketch by W H Reynolds shows the mill in greater detail, and was done at a later date. The mill had two undershot waterwheels and was valued in the Church Rate Books of 1764 at Â£64.1s.1d. Latterly a steam engine was installed to enable the mill to work for longer periods. The mill was demolished in 1858. Latterly it drove five pairs of millstones, one wheel worked two pairs of French Burr stones and one pair of Peak stones. The other wheel worked two pairs of French Burr stones, wheat cleaners, flour dressers and the <b>sack</b> <b>hoist.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Golden Green is a hamlet within Hadlow parish. A mill {{may have}} been on this site since Domesday. This Grade II listed mill is the only mill on the Bourne to retain most of its milling machinery. The {{internal}} waterwheel is of iron, and is breast shot. It is [...] diameter and [...] wide. on a cast iron axle. The pit wheel is [...] diameter and has 120 cogs, driving a [...] diameter wallower with 35 teeth on a [...] diameter wooden upright shaft. The Great Spur Wheel is [...] diameter and has 92 cogs. The date 1848 is on a plinth {{at the bottom of}} the Upright shaft, and may indicate the date of the existing waterwheel and machinery. The crown wheel was used latterly to drive the electricity generator, with one of the stone nuts being adapted as the driven gear. The mill had two pairs of millstones and last ground corn c.1920. The <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> does not survive. In the early-mid 20th century, the mill was used to generate electricity, but the apparatus has now been removed. The mill was also known as Bourneside Mill and Victoria Mill (Victoria Road is downstream of the mill). The outbuildings around the mill have been converted into holiday cottages.|$|E
50|$|The {{millstones}} themselves turn {{at around}} 120 rpm. They are laid {{one on top}} of the other. The bottom stone, called the bed, is fixed to the floor, while the top stone, the runner, is mounted on a separate spindle, driven by the main shaft. A wheel called the stone nut connects the runner's spindle to the main shaft, and this can be moved out of the way to disconnect the stone and stop it turning, leaving the main shaft turning to drive other machinery. This might include driving a mechanical sieve to refine the flour, or turning a wooden drum to wind up a chain used to <b>hoist</b> <b>sacks</b> of grain to the top of the mill house. The distance between the stones can be varied to produce the grade of flour required; moving the stones closer together produces finer flour.|$|R
60|$|The yard of the West Ham {{shelter of}} the Salvation Army is a cold place on a January morning. The {{building}} itself, an old warehouse, is newly whitewashed. Its gabled end projects into the yard in the middle, with a door on the ground floor, and another in the loft above it without any balcony or ladder, but with a pulley rigged over it for <b>hoisting</b> <b>sacks.</b> Those who come from this central gable end into the yard have the gateway leading to the street on their left, with a stone horse-trough just beyond it, and, on the right, a penthouse shielding a table from the weather. There are forms at the table; and on them are seated {{a man and a}} woman, both much down on their luck, finishing a meal of bread [one thick slice each, with margarine and golden syrup] and diluted milk.|$|R

50|$|The second main {{ingredient}} in beer is barley malt. This {{has already been}} malted in a malthouse outside the brewery tower {{and may have been}} stored for some time since. The malted grains are lifted up the tower mechanically, by either a <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> or a continuous elevator. From here they are fed into a grist mill (4th floor) which crushes the grains to open their seed coat and allow good extraction of their contents.|$|E
5000|$|Hoo Mill in Haselor, is also {{powered by}} the river between Great Alne and Alcester and is {{considered}} to be the most complete traditional water-mill in the area. It still retains an internal waterwheel, which is still operational with a complete, but disused set of corn milling machinery, including an unusual <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> system. Constructed in 1810, the mill was also used for needle pointing. The last owner generated his own hydro-electricity using a turbine.|$|E
50|$|Bardwell Mill is a four storey tower mill. The beehive cap is winded by a fantail. When fitted, {{the four}} double Patent sails have {{a span of}} 63 ft and are carried on a cast iron windshaft which was cast in 1989 (the {{original}} windshaft in the mill was cast in two pieces). The brake wheel is wood, driving a cast iron wallower carried on a wooden upright shaft. The wooden great spur wheel drives two pairs of overdrift millstones. A wooden crownwheel on the upright shaft drives a <b>sack</b> <b>hoist.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{restoration}} of the mill began in 1977. The cap frame was removed on 17 August 1979 by Messrs Lennard & Lawn, millwrights, based at Caston. The new cap was fitted on 2 August 1979. The first pair of sails were fitted on 17 May 1980 and the second pair on 26 May 1983. The tower was coated with Bellecoat Stipple, a black resin-based protective covering. Internally, new floors were fitted, and a new stage constructed around the mill. Replacement machinery was sourced from other windmills. The drive for the <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> came from Harpley.|$|E
50|$|The torenmolen van Gronsveld is a five storey brick tower mill. The {{vertical}} walls up to {{the stone}} floor are 1.9 m thick and house a spiral staircase and a shaft for the <b>sack</b> <b>hoist.</b> The meal floor has two hearths built into the wall, either one {{of which could be}} used depending on the wind direction. The first floor served as a storage room and is supported by a vaulted roof over the entrance on the ground floor. A 3 m high mound was thrown up around the mill for the miller to reach the sails.|$|E
50|$|The mill was {{originally}} {{powered by a}} tributary of the River Rother. At one time the mill had two waterwheels, each working two pairs of millstones. The 12 ft diameter overshot waterwheel, which {{was originally}} cast at Cocking Foundry for Coster's Mill, West Lavington, drives the two pairs of millstone, a <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> and flour dresser. The machinery in the mill was installed in 1911. The mill was donated to the Museum in 1973 and carefully dismantled, at which time evidence was found of a previous use of the site as a Hammer mill. Re-erection and restoration of the machinery took seven years.|$|E
50|$|A <b>sack</b> <b>hoist</b> {{was used}} to lift grain to the attic, or garner floor.From there it was poured down to the {{winnower}} on the stone floor to remove chaff.The cleaned grain was then hoisted {{back up to the}} attic and poured into large storage bins on the bin floor.The grain was delivered from the bin floor through chutes to the stone floor, where it was ground to produce meal.The meal was then hoisted again and poured down to the flour dresser, which produced white flour and bran products.Grain was delivered to the mill by cart or by sailing vessels, and flour was shipped by sailing vessel.|$|E
