5|$|At metamorphosis, {{rapid changes}} in the body take place as the {{lifestyle}} of the frog changes completely. The spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a large jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac.

There are associated {{changes in the}} neural networks such as development of <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>vision</b> and loss of the lateral line system. All this can happen in about a day. A few days later, the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place.|$|E

5|$|Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a {{protective}} ring of bone {{created by a}} connection between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>vision,</b> the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea.|$|E
5|$|The eye-sockets of Tyrannosaurus are {{positioned}} {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks.

In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators (the principal exceptions are primates, which need it for leaping from branch to branch). Unlike Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight. In Gorgosaurus specimens, the eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole-shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera. In Daspletosaurus, this was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} that Elasmosaurus and its kin stalked schools of fish, concealing themselves below and moving the head slowly up as they approached. The eyes of the animal were located {{at the top of}} the head and allowed them to see directly upward. This <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>vision</b> would help it find small prey. Hunting from below would also have helped by silhouetting the prey in the sunlight while concealing Elasmosaurus in the dark waters below. Elasmosaurids probably ate small bony fish and marine invertebrates, as their small, non-kinetic skulls would have limited the prey they could eat. The long, slender teeth were adapted for seizing prey and not tearing, and hence it was swallowed whole. It swallowed small stones to aid its digestion.|$|E
25|$|Stenonychosaurus teeth, however, are {{different}} from most other theropods. One comparative study of the feeding apparatus suggests that Stenonychosaurus {{could have been an}} omnivore.

Additionally, the teeth of Stenonychosaurus bore large serrations, each of which is called a denticle. There are pits at the intersections of the denticles, and the points of the denticles point towards the tip, or apex, of each tooth. The teeth show wear facets on their sides. Holtz (1998) also noted that characteristics used to support a predatory habit for Stenonychosaurus - the grasping hands, large brain and <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>vision,</b> are all characteristics shared with the herbivorous/omnivorous primates and omnivorous Procyon (raccoon).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a remote vision {{system designed to}} be used for telepresence applications. Telepresence is essentially being able to assert one's presence at a remote location. Being able to see and talk to people in another corner of the world is one method of telepresence we have come to know as video conferencing. As technologies evolve, the sense of `presence' allowed by them also grows. Present-day telepresence systems limit our most prominent sense, sight, to monoscopic video where we only see one view of the remote location. In order to take telepresence to the next level by being able to manipulate remote objects, it is important that our sight be stimulated to perceive depth to the fullest. Therefore, this thesis focuses on creating a <b>stereoscopic</b> remote <b>vision</b> system designed for teleoperation. Delay plays a major part in the ease of teleoperation. While most teleoperation systems focus of alleviating the effects of delay by means of control methodologies and environment modeling, this system attempts to directly minimize delay and other factors of human discomfort. This was done by analyzing the several technologies involved in capture, compression, transport and display of 3 D video along with an exploration on the factors of human comfort and performance for teleoperation. The most appropriate technologies were then selected while keeping these factors in mind. The <b>stereoscopic</b> remote <b>vision</b> system was then designed and implemented while keeping a focus to minimize delay. The resulting system was then used as a testbench to further explore the same factors. Embedded SystemsComputer EngineeringElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R

500|$|Mantises have stereo vision. They locate {{their prey}} by sight; their {{compound}} eyes contain up to 10,000 ommatidia. A small {{area at the}} front called the fovea has greater visual acuity {{than the rest of}} the eye, and can produce the high resolution necessary to examine potential prey. The peripheral ommatidia are concerned with perceiving motion; when a moving object is noticed, the head is rapidly rotated to bring the object into the visual field of the fovea. Further motions of the prey are then tracked by movements of the mantis's head so as to keep the image centered on the fovea. The eyes are widely spaced and laterally situated, affording a wide binocular field of vision and precise <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>vision</b> at close range. The dark spot on each eye that moves as it rotates its head is a pseudopupil. This occurs because the ommatidia that are viewed [...] "head-on" [...] absorb the incident light, while those to the side reflect it.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the tadpole stage, a frog {{undergoes}} metamorphosis {{in which}} its body makes a sudden transition into the adult form. This metamorphosis typically lasts only 24 hours, and is initiated by production of the hormone thyroxine. This causes different tissues to develop in different ways. The principal changes that take place include the development of the lungs and the disappearance of the gills and gill pouch, making the front legs visible. The lower jaw transforms into the big mandible of the carnivorous adult, and the long, spiral gut of the herbivorous tadpole is replaced by the typical short gut of a predator. The nervous system becomes adapted for hearing and <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>vision,</b> and for new methods of locomotion and feeding. The eyes are repositioned higher up on the head and the eyelids and associated glands are formed. The eardrum, middle ear, and inner ear are developed. The skin becomes thicker and tougher, the lateral line system is lost, and skin glands are developed. [...] The final stage is the disappearance of the tail, but this takes place rather later, the tissue being used to produce a spurt of growth in the limbs. Frogs are at their most vulnerable to predators when they are undergoing metamorphosis. At this time, the tail is being lost and locomotion by means of limbs is only just becoming established.|$|E
500|$|Until Owen {{published}} a definitive anatomical study in 1866, early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye-aye (genus Daubentonia) was a primate, rodent, or marsupial. [...] In {{the late eighteenth}} century, for example, the aye-aye was classified under the squirrel genus Sciurus. [...] By emphasizing its primate features, such as its postorbital bar, <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>vision,</b> and opposable hallux, over its rodent-like teeth, Owen demonstrated its affinity with other primates. [...] In 1996, Ankel-Simons demonstrated that the shape and arrangement of the aye-aye's diminutive deciduous incisors indicate that this genus has a shared ancestry with the toothcombed primates. [...] However, {{the placement of the}} aye-aye within the primates remained problematic until very recently. [...] The karyotype of the aye-aye is noticeably different from that of its closest relatives, the lorises {{and the rest of the}} lemurs, with a diploid chromosome count of 2n=30. [...] Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus Daubentonia as a specialized indriid, a sister group to all strepsirrhines, and an indeterminate taxon within the primates. In 1931, Schwarz labeled the aye-aye as an offshoot of Indriidae, claiming that all lemurs were monophyletic, whereas Reginald Innes Pocock had previously placed the aye-aye outside of the lemurs. [...] In that same year, Anthony and Coupin classified the aye-aye under infraorder Chiromyiformes, a sister group to the other strepsirrhines. [...] Colin Groves upheld this classification in 2005 because he was not entirely convinced the aye-aye formed a clade with the rest of the Malagasy lemurs, despite molecular tests that had shown Daubentoniidae was basal to all Lemuroidea.|$|E
