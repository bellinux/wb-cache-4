500|$|By 1974, Patti Smith was {{performing}} rock music, initially with guitarist, bassist and rock archivist Lenny Kaye, and {{later with a}} full band comprising Kaye, Ivan Kral on guitar and bass, Jay Dee Daugherty on drums and Richard Sohl on piano. Ivan Kral was a refugee from Czechoslovakia who {{had moved to the}} United States in 1966 with his parents, who were diplomats. After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Kral decided not to return. Financed by Sam Wagstaff, the band recorded a first single, [...] "Hey Joe / Piss Factory", in 1974. The A-side was a version of the rock standard {{with the addition of a}} spoken word piece about fugitive heiress Patty Hearst ("Patty Hearst, you're standing there in front of the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread, I was wondering were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women..."). A court later heard that Hearst had been confined against her will, and had been repeatedly threatened with execution and raped. The B-side describes the helpless anger Smith had felt while working on a factory assembly line and the salvation she discovered in the form of a shoplifted book, the 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations. In a 1996 interview which discusses artistic influences during her younger years, Smith said, [...] "I had devoted <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> girlish daydreams to Rimbaud. Rimbaud was like my boyfriend." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Cody was {{impressed}} with the production design team's creation of the set from only a few sentences in her script, calling Juno's bedroom [...] "a very emotional set for [...] because it reminded me <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own little habitat when I was a teenager." [...] The walls of Juno's room are covered with posters of bands, while Leah's room includes a mural of older men whom she finds attractive, and Paulie's room is designed to be overly childlike to indicate his innocence. Production designer Steve Saklad designed Mark and Vanessa's house with the assumption that [...] "Vanessa has probably read every home magazine and tried to copy what's in them as best she could." [...] Costume designer Monique Prudhomme was nominated for a Costume Designers Guild Award in the [...] "Excellence in Contemporary Costume Design for Film" [...] category. She dressed Vanessa in clothes that were [...] "simple and very tasteful" [...] but with an [...] "anal-retentive quality," [...] while dressing Mark in conservative clothing that complements Vanessa's taste. It was Page's suggestion that Juno wear flannel shirts and sweater-vests. Page also had to wear two sizes of prosthetic belly fitted like a corset in the back, as well as a third [...] "real" [...] belly that is seen when Juno has an ultrasound and a variety of sizes of fake breasts. The footage displayed on Juno's ultrasound monitor is of supervising sound designer Scott Sanders's son Matthew and was embedded into the scene in post-production.|$|E

Moreover, my father has just returned from Villeroy with the garrison of the castle, and it is a great pleasure to me to have his society again." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{diary of}} Lemuel Carpenter's {{daughter}} Mary Refugio Carpenter includes this entry written on January 2, 1861: [...] "I {{have been thinking}} <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> father tonight. [...] It made me weep." ...|$|E
2500|$|In any case, Price {{was pleased}} with the result, writing that Lovecraft [...] "was right of course in {{discarding}} all but the basic outline. I could only marvel that he had made <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> inadequate and bungling start." [...] The story appeared under both authors' bylines in the July 1934 issue of Weird Tales; Price's draft was published as [...] "The Lord of Illusion" [...] in Crypt of Cthulhu No. 10 in 1982.|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} the Star Trek: The Next Generation TV and film franchises typecast Stewart as Picard and obtaining other roles became difficult. He also found {{returning}} to the stage difficult because of his long departure. He commented {{that he would never}} have joined The Next Generation had he known that it would air for seven years: [...] "No, no. NO. And looking back now it still frightens me a little bit to think that <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life was totally devoted to Star Trek and almost nothing else." ...|$|E

60|$|Your former letter reached me in due time; your second, from Cambridge, two {{or three}} days ago. I ought to have written to you long since, but really I have for some time, from private and public causes of sorrow and apprehension, been in a great measure {{deprived}} of those genial feelings which, thro' life, have not been <b>so</b> <b>much</b> accompaniments <b>of</b> <b>my</b> character, as vital principles <b>of</b> <b>my</b> existence.|$|R
5000|$|Commented Scott Reeder after {{listening}} to the album: [...] "I'm reminded of why music has been <b>so</b> <b>much</b> a part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life and brought me <b>so</b> <b>much</b> satisfaction in reaching out to people at home {{and all over the}} world."

2500|$|In 1999, Gurewitz {{reunited with}} Graffin to co-write a song together, called [...] "Believe It", which would appear on their next album, The New America (2000). For it, Todd Rundgren, an early musical {{inspiration}} for Graffin, {{was brought in}} to produce. [...] "Todd was kind of an underground sensation back in 1974. Here's a guy who was making pop music but in a way that you wouldn't hear on the radio. <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> early musical identity was wrapped up in the way he conducted himself." [...] In the summer of 2000, they set out on a 3-month U.S. arena tour opening for Blink-182. Unfortunately, the experience might not have been all that Greg {{and the rest of the}} band might have hoped. Interest in recording the record waned, due to Rundgren's poor attitude. Jay Bentley reflects on this by saying, [...] "I didn't feel we were going anywhere and so did Greg. Todd didn't like Greg and that made Greg so mad! He met his idol and he was a jerk! I don't think Todd gave a shit about anything." [...] However, Graffin later writes in his book, Anarchy Evolution, that although Todd Rundgren was difficult to work with, he and Graffin are friends to this day. Meanwhile, Bobby Schayer left the band following a serious shoulder injury and was replaced by Brooks Wackerman (Suicidal Tendencies).|$|E

6000|$|He {{stopped a}} moment. [...] "First of all, I {{want to say}} I'm sorry I went by that day without {{answering}} your whistle. Merril had worked me up against you, and since I get a bonus on results, every dollar's worth of freight you picked up was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> pocket.

The summer is passing on, and I have not left home, and perhaps shall not; for it is far more from duty than inclination that I quit my dear and beautiful home; and duty pulls two ways. On the one side my mind stands in need of being fed by new objects for meditation and reflection, the more so because diseased eyes have cut me off <b>so</b> <b>much</b> from reading; and, on the other hand, I am obliged to look at the expense of distant travelling, as I am not able to take <b>so</b> <b>much</b> out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> body by walking as heretofore.|$|R
