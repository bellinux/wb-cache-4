50|$|A dual-currency note (DC) pays coupons in the investor's {{domestic}} currency with the notional in the issuer’s {{domestic currency}}. A reverse dual-currency note (RDC) is a note which pays a foreign interest {{rate in the}} investor's domestic currency. A power reverse dual-currency note (PRDC) is a structured product where an investor is seeking a better return and a borrower a lower rate {{by taking advantage of}} the interest rate differential between two economies. The power component of the name denotes higher initial coupons and the fact that coupons rise as the foreign exchange rate depreciates. The power feature comes with a higher risk for the investor, which characterizes the product as leveraged carry trade. Cash flows may have a digital cap feature where the rate gets locked once it reaches a certain threshold. Other add-on features include barriers such as knockouts and cancel provision for the issuer. PRDCs are part of the wider <b>Structured</b> <b>Notes</b> Market.|$|E
5000|$|Minibond is a {{brand name}} {{for a series of}} {{structured}} financial notes issued in Hong Kong and Singapore under the control of Lehman Brothers. It is a misnomer to describe the Minibond as credit-linked note because of the Synthetic Collateralised Debt Obligations hidden in the three-layered structure (as all series of Minibonds issued in 2004 and thereafter are). The term [...] "Minibond" [...] is also used to refer to other likewise <b>structured</b> <b>Notes,</b> namely Constellation Notes and Octave Notes, respectively issued in Hong Kong under the direction of DBS Bank and Morgan Stanley. These Notes, coupled with Minibonds and other Equity-linked Notes issued by Lehman Brothers, are sometimes officially referred to as [...] "Lehman-related securities". For the sake of completeness, Lehman Brothers arranged 3 [...] "Special Purpose Entities" [...] (hereafter [...] "SPE") to issue Minibond-like Notes in Hong Kong from 2002 to 2008. Minibonds are issued by Pacific International Finance Limited, and the Notes issued by the other 2 SPE are branded [...] "ProFund Notes" [...] and [...] "Pyxis Notes". Unlike the Minibonds which have a three-layered structure, these latter Notes feature 2 layers of notes bundled together with prominence given exclusively to one so as to obscure the nature and importance of the other.|$|E
40|$|The {{electronic}} engineering notebook is a {{pen-based computer}} tool designed to capture engineering notes and {{to assist in}} structuring them to facilitate subsequent information access. Experiments were conducted in which free-form and fixed-form note-taking interfaces were compared with respect to capturing and <b>structuring</b> <b>notes</b> from a design meeting. Suitability of domain-based and user-defined terminologies for semantic structuring was also tested. Results from the experiment confirmed that a free-form interface was easier to use for note-taking and <b>structuring</b> <b>notes</b> than were forms with fixed structure. However, difficulties with applying semantic categorizations were observed in both types of interface. The results indicated that terminology should be chosen appropriately to a task, and that experienced users have less problems with applying it. The experiment also demonstrated high diversity in note-taking styles, thus highlighting the need to accommodate individual preferences in electronic notebooks...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} {{circumstances}} under which speculative attacks on the currency board of Hong Kong occurred during the Asian financial turmoil. It argues that interest rate arbitrage as a defense mechanism would not function properly unless the risk premium of holding Hong Kong dollar could be reduced by restoration of confidence. A proposal to issue <b>structured</b> <b>notes,</b> or put options to strengthen the currency board is made. Arguments for and against the proposal are reviewed. We show that the "technical " measures eventually undertaken by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are analytically equivalent to issuing the <b>structured</b> <b>notes.</b> Empirical tests indicate that interest rate arbitrage had been working properly until the rule-bound currency board had been eroded by discretion introduced by the Monetary Authority. However, after implementing the <b>structured</b> <b>notes</b> proposal, interest rate arbitrage appeared to be effective again. JEL Classification: E 42, E 58, F 41...|$|E
40|$|<b>Structured</b> <b>notes</b> are debt {{instruments}} whose cash flows {{are linked to}} the movement in one or more indexes, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodities prices, prepayment rates, or other market variables.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to analyse {{relevant}} judicial decisions in Taiwan regarding <b>structured</b> <b>notes</b> sold to retail investors. Regarding pre-sale disputes, one issue was that investors failed to read contractual documents properly before signing contracts, so there was a question whether they could later claim a bank’s violation of its duty to explain. This article favours the view that an investor’s signature may exempt a bank’s duty, provided that investors are made aware of relevant warnings. In addition, for suitability assessment, relevant judgments show that customers were too easily classified as active investors based on a simple questionnaire. This may violate the spirit of the suitability rule. Moreover, courts or regulators must clarify the nature of post-sale duty to report and whether a bank has a duty to advise a client under a trust relationship. Furthermore, to look at the big picture, regulators should review the nature of investment in overseas <b>structured</b> <b>notes</b> via non-discretionary trust with a domestic bank in order to construct an efficient way to regulate such forms of investment and to justify the effectiveness of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms so as to offer complete protection to retail investors...|$|E
