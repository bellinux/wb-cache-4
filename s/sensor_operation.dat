50|$|The AFR <b>sensor</b> <b>operation</b> can {{be thought}} of as being similar to the hot wire mass airflow sensor (MAF). But, instead of an MAF hot wire, the ECM tries to keep a {{perfectly}} stoichiometric air/fuel ratio inside the monitoring chamber by varying the pump cell circuit current. The sensing part at the tip of the sensor, is always held at a constant voltage (depending on manufacturer). If the mixture goes rich, the ECM will adjust the current flowing through the sensing tip or pump cell circuit until the constant operating voltage level is achieved again. The voltage change happens very fast. The current through the pump circuit also pushes along the oxygen atoms either into, or out of, the diffusion chamber (monitoring chamber) which restores the monitoring chamber’s air/fuel ratio to stoichiometry. Although the ECM varies the current, it tries to maintain the pump circuit at a constant voltage potential.|$|E
50|$|Initially, TARPS {{was not a}} {{priority}} on the Air Tasking Order during Desert Shield/Storm due to availability of strategic assets like the U-2/TR-1 and plentiful USAF RF-4 units. However, once Desert Storm started, the demand for realtime intel overwhelmed the other assets and TARPS missions were called upon to meet the demand. Immediately, {{it became obvious that}} Tomcats were favored for in country missions over the RF-4 as they required no escort and needed less fuel pre and post mission, which was a real concern at the time. TARPS continued to be utilized post Desert Storm and training was modified to take into account medium altitude tactics such as were flown in Desert Storm. Prior to that, the majority of TARPS missions training missions were low altitude overland and over water navigation and imagery. Only mapping was flown at medium altitudes. TARPS was used routinely in Operation Southern Watch over Iraq and called upon in Bosnia in 1995 and then again over Kosovo in 1999. The advent of LANTIRN into Tomcat operations provided a useful complement to TARPS. Since both systems need the same real estate in the rear cockpit for <b>sensor</b> <b>operation</b> control panels, they cannot be mounted on the aircraft at the same time, but they can be flown in formation yielding the best of both systems.|$|E

40|$|Radio {{frequency}} interference (RFI) is a known {{issue in}} low-frequency radar remote sensing. In {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) image processing, RFI can cause severe degradation of image quality, distortion of polarimetric signatures, and an increase of the SAR phase noise level. To address this issue, a processing system was developed {{that is capable of}} reliably detecting, characterizing, and mitigating RFI signatures in SAR observations. In addition to being the basis for image correction, the robust RFI-detection algorithms developed in this paper are used to retrieve a wealth of RFI-related information that allows for mapping, characterizing, and classifying RFI signatures across large spatial scales. The extracted RFI information is expected to be valuable input for SAR-system design, <b>sensor</b> <b>operations,</b> and the development of effective RFI-mitigation strategies.

40|$|In this work, we {{consider}} the application of classical statistical inference to the fusion of data from different sensing technologies for object detection applications {{in order to increase}} the overall performance for a given active safety automotive system. ^ Research evolved mainly around a centralized sensor fusion architecture assuming that three non-identical sensors, modeled by corresponding probability density functions (pdfs), provide discrete information of target being present or absent with associated probabilities of detection and false alarm for the sensor fusion engine. The underlying sensing technologies are the following standard automotive sensors: 24. 5 GHz radar, high dynamic range infrared camera and a laser-radar. A complete mathematical framework was developed to select the optimal decision rule based on a generalized multinomial distribution resulting from a sum of weighted Bernoulli random variables from the Neyman-Pearson lemma and the likelihood ratio test. Moreover, to better understand the model and to obtain upper bounds on the performance of the fusion rules, we assumed exponential pdfs for each sensor and a parallel mathematical expression was obtained based on a generalized gamma distribution resulting from a sum of weighted exponential random variables for the situation when the continuous random vector of information is available. ^ Mathematical expressions and results were obtained for modeling the following case scenarios: (i) non-identical sensors, (ii) identical sensors, (iii) combination of nonidentical and identical sensors, (iv) faulty <b>sensor</b> <b>operation,</b> (v) dominant <b>sensor</b> <b>operation,</b> (vi) negative <b>sensor</b> <b>operation,</b> and (vii) distributed sensor fusion. ^ The second and final part of this research focused on: (a) simulation of statistical models for each sensing technology, (b) comparisons with distributed fusion, (c) overview of dynamic sensor fusion and adaptive decision rules. ...|$|E
