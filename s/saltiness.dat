5|$|Potassium can be {{detected}} by taste because it triggers {{three of the five}} types of taste sensations, according to concentration. Dilute solutions of potassium ions taste sweet, allowing moderate concentrations in milk and juices, while higher concentrations become increasingly bitter/alkaline, and finally also salty to the taste. The combined bitterness and <b>saltiness</b> of high-potassium solutions makes high-dose potassium supplementation by liquid drinks a palatability challenge.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell {{due to the lack of}} the olfactory bulb, but they do have an olfactory tract. Baleen whales have few if any taste buds, suggesting they have lost their sense of taste. They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can taste <b>saltiness.</b>|$|E
5|$|As bacon {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The <b>saltiness</b> of the bacon highlights {{the sweetness of the}} ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, the bacon should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of sweetening the bacon, in a similar manner to pancakes {{in some parts of the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Seawater is {{invariably}} salty and, {{although its}} degree of <b>saltiness</b> (salinity) can vary, about 90% {{of the water}} in the ocean has 34– (1.2 oz.) of dissolved solids per liter, producing a salinity between 3.4 and 3.5%. To easily describe small differences, however, oceanographers usually express salinity as a millage (‰) or part per thousand (ppt) instead of using percents. The surface salinity of waters in the Northern Hemisphere are generally closer to the 34‰ mark, while those in the South are closer to 35‰. The solutes in ocean water come both from inflowing river water and from the ocean floor. The relative composition of the solutes is stable throughout the world's oceans: sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) make up about 85%. Other solutes include metal ions such as magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) and negative ions such as sulfate (SO₄), carbonate (CO₃), and bromides. In the absence of other pollution, seawater would not be harmful to drink except that it is much too saline; similarly, it cannot be used for irrigating most plants without being desalinated. For scientific and technical purposes, a standardized form of artificial seawater is often used.|$|E
25|$|The size of lithium and {{potassium}} ions most closely {{resemble those of}} sodium, and thus the <b>saltiness</b> is most similar. In contrast, rubidium and cesium ions are far larger, so their salty taste differs accordingly.

25|$|The Aboriginal {{name for}} the area is Arkaroo, {{the name of a}} legendary great snake. Arkaroo is reputed to have drank up all the water in Lake Frome, but, upset by its <b>saltiness,</b> he wriggled into the depths of the ranges, where his upset stomach {{continues}} to rumble to this day. The booming noises which are heard in the ranges today are thought to either be wind whistling through the narrow gorges or (more probably) large rockfalls. Arkaroo is the origin of the placename Arkaroola, used in several contexts in the area (also as the name of a station south of Wilpena).|$|E
25|$|In 1609, Henry Hudson sailed up what is {{now called}} the Hudson River in search of the Passage; {{encouraged}} by the <b>saltiness</b> of the water in the estuary, he reached present-day Albany, New York, before giving up. He later explored the Arctic and Hudson Bay. In 1611, while in James Bay, Hudson's crew mutinied. They set Hudson and his teenage son John, along with seven sick, infirm, or loyal crewmen, adrift in a small open boat. He was never seen again. Cree oral legend reports that the survivors lived and traveled with the Cree for more than a year.|$|E
500|$|The feral ponies in both herds {{separate}} {{themselves into}} small bands, with most {{consisting of a}} stallion, several mares and their foals. [...] Ponies on Assateague have a diet that consists mainly of cordgrass, a coarse grass that grows in salt marshes, which makes up around 80 percent of their food. This diet is supplemented by other vegetation such as rose hips, bayberry, greenbriar, American beach grass, seaweed and poison ivy. Chincoteague ponies require up to twice as much water as most horses require due to the <b>saltiness</b> of their diet. The increased amount of water that they drink contributes to many ponies appearing to be bloated or fat.|$|E

2500|$|The {{sensation}} of taste includes five established basic tastes: sweetness, sourness, <b>saltiness,</b> [...] bitterness, and savoriness. Scientific experiments have proven that these five tastes exist and are distinct from one another. Taste buds {{are able to}} differentiate among different tastes through detecting interaction with different molecules or ions. Sweet, savory, and bitter tastes are triggered by the binding of molecules to G protein-coupled receptors on the cell membranes of taste buds. <b>Saltiness</b> and sourness are perceived when alkali metal or hydrogen ions enter taste buds, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Bitter {{foods are}} {{generally}} found unpleasant, while sour, salty, sweet, and savory tasting foods generally provide a pleasurable sensation. [...] The five specific tastes received by taste receptors are <b>saltiness,</b> sweetness, bitterness, sourness, and umami, often {{known by its}} Japanese term [...] "umami" [...] which translates to ‘delicious’. As of the early twentieth century, Western physiologists and psychologists believed there were four basic tastes: sweetness, sourness, <b>saltiness,</b> and bitterness. At that time savoriness was not identified but now {{a large number of}} authorities recognize it as the fifth taste.|$|E

2500|$|The {{classification}} {{according to}} the Five Flavors, (五味, , sometimes also translated as Five Tastes): acrid, sweet, bitter, sour, and salty. Substances may also {{have more than one}} flavor, or none (i.e., a [...] "bland" [...] flavor). Each of the Five Flavors corresponds to one of zàng organs, which in turn corresponds to one of the Five Phases. A flavor implies certain properties and therapeutic actions of a substance; e.g., <b>saltiness</b> drains downward and softens hard masses, while sweetness is supplementing, harmonizing, and moistening.|$|E
2500|$|The Five Flavors, {{sometimes}} also {{translated as}} Five Tastes, are: acrid/pungent (辛), sweet (甘), bitter (苦), sour (酸), and salty (咸).

Each of the Five Flavors corresponds to one of the zàng organs, which in turn corresponds to one of the Five Phases: A flavor implies certain properties and therapeutic actions of a substance: <b>saltiness</b> [...] "drains downward and softens hard masses"; sweetness is [...] "supplementing, harmonizing, and moistening"; pungent substances are thought to induce sweat and act on qi and blood; sourness tends to be astringent (涩) in nature; bitterness [...] "drains heat, purges the bowels, and eliminates dampness".|$|E
2500|$|Then {{there came}} {{a time when the}} number of people became too large. There was not enough of Earth's Milk (or [...] "Jiyu") to go around for everyone. Because of this, a man from the line of Baekso 백소(白巢) by the name of Jiso 지소(支巢) decided to cede his meal of Earth's Milk five times to his {{neighbours}} (other versions say that he waited in line but the line was so long he never got his turn). Eventually his hunger grew intolerable, and deciding to kill himself he headed towards a cliff, where he saw a grape vine growing in the edges. Unable to suppress his hunger, he ate the grapes and immediately acquired the five tastes of sourness, bitterness, spiciness, sweetness, and <b>saltiness.</b> This is known as the Incident of the Five Tastes (오미의 변).|$|E
2500|$|It {{is through}} the aromas of wine that wine is smelled. The human tongue {{is limited to the}} primary tastes {{perceived}} by taste receptors on the tongue-sourness, bitterness, <b>saltiness,</b> sweetness and savoriness. The wide array of fruit, earthy, floral, herbal, mineral and woodsy flavor present in wine are derived from aroma notes sensed by the olfactory bulb. In wine tasting, wine is sometimes smelled before being drunk in order to identify some components of the wine that may be present. Different terms are used to describe what is being smelled. The most basic term is aroma which generally refers to a [...] "pleasant" [...] smell as opposed to odor which refers to an unpleasant smell or possible wine fault. The term aroma may be further distinguished from bouquet which generally refers to the smells that arise from the chemical reactions of fermentation and aging of the wine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} receptor {{found in}} the mouth is the sodium chloride (salt) receptor. <b>Saltiness</b> is a taste produced primarily {{by the presence of}} sodium ions. Other ions of the alkali metals group also taste salty, but the further from sodium, the less salty the sensation is. [...] A sodium channel in the taste cell wall allows sodium cations to enter the cell. This on its own depolarizes the cell, and opens voltage-dependent calcium channels, flooding the cell with positive calcium ions and leading to neurotransmitter release. This sodium channel is known as an epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and is composed of three subunits. An ENaC can be blocked by the drug amiloride in many mammals, especially rats. The sensitivity of the salt taste to amiloride in humans, however, is much less pronounced, leading to conjecture that there may be additional receptor proteins besides ENaC to be discovered.|$|E
2500|$|While it {{is often}} said that [...] "taste is subjective", there are {{quantifiable}} taste characteristics (like bitter, sweet, salty or sour) that can be perceived and measured as low, moderate or high—such as measuring the sweetness of honey or the <b>saltiness</b> of oysters. Flavors, such as butterscotch, char and strawberry, are more personal and can't be quantifiable. Flavors are either perceived to be present or not. The perception of flavors is linked to our sense of smell, while tastes come from the sensory glands of the taste buds. Though individual sensitivity to the different taste [...] "senses" [...] can vary, wine experts will often recommend pairings based on these more objective measurements rather than the more subjective concept of [...] "flavors". In wine there are three basic tastes-bitter, sweet and sour. These three tastes can each be identified with a primary component of the wine-tannins (bitter), residual sugar (sweet) and acidity (sour). A fourth component, alcohol, is identified in wine tasting with a perception of [...] "heat" [...] or hotness {{in the back of the}} mouth and is the primary factor influencing the body of the wine. The residual heat of the alcohol can be considered in food pairing with some ingredients minimizing the heat of the wine while some will accentuate it.|$|E
