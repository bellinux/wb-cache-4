Students who do exceptionally well on the USAMO (typically around 30 students) are invited to go to the Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program (MOSP or more commonly, MOP), and six students are selected from the top twelve scorers on the USAMO (through yet another exam, the Team <b>Selection</b> <b>Test</b> (TST)) to form the United States International Math Olympiad Team.|$|E

Cluster <b>test</b> <b>selection</b> approaches use historical execution profiles and clustering algorithms for <b>test</b> <b>selection.</b> Cluster <b>test</b> <b>selection</b> can {{reduce the cost of}} testing and preserve strong fault detection capability. In this paper, we design and implement an empirical study on cluster <b>test</b> <b>selection</b> approaches. The empirical study shows that different clustering algorithms will affect the results of <b>test</b> <b>selection</b> significantly, and different execution profiles will partially affect the results of <b>test</b> <b>selection...</b>|$|R

50|$|Since 1985, further {{selection}} {{tests have}} been used after BMO2 to select the IMO team. (The team was selected following the single BMO paper from 1967 to 1971, then following the FIST paper for some years from 1972.) Initially these third-stage tests resulted in selection of both team and reserve; from 1993 a squad (team plus reserve) was selected following these tests with the team being separated from the reserve after further correspondence training, and after further selection tests from 2001 onwards. The third-stage tests have had names including FIST 2 (1985), Second International <b>Selection</b> <b>Test</b> (SIST), Reading <b>Selection</b> <b>Test</b> (1987), Final <b>Selection</b> <b>Test</b> (FST, 1992 to 2001) and First <b>Selection</b> <b>Test</b> (FST, from 2002); the fourth-stage tests have been Team <b>Selection</b> <b>Test</b> (TST, 2001) and Next <b>Selection</b> <b>Test</b> (NST, 2002 onwards). These tests have been held at training and selection camps in several locations, recently Trinity College, Cambridge and Oundle School.|$|E

The results show that the most appropriate price variable varies from one market to another although two price variables appear to be dominant: the extreme value variance and the absolute price change. The results do not provide much support for the notion of asymmetry in the price-volume relation.

40|$|Background Evidence-based {{physical}} employment {{standards are}} vital for recruiting, training {{and maintaining the}} operational effectiveness of personnel in physically demanding occupations. Aims (1) Develop criterion tests for in-service physical assessment, which simulate the role- related physical demands of UK Fire and Rescue Service (UK FRS) personnel. (2) Develop practical physical <b>selection</b> <b>tests</b> for FRS applicants. (3) Evaluate {{the validity of the}} <b>selection</b> <b>tests</b> to predict criterion test performance. Methods Stage 1 : We conducted a physical demands analysis involving seven workshops and an expert panel to document the key physical tasks required of UK FRS personnel and to develop ‘criterion’ and ‘selection’ tests. Stage 2 : We measured the performance of 137 trainee and 50 trained UK FRS personnel on selection, criterion and ‘field’ measures of aerobic power, strength and body size. Statistical models were developed to predict criterion test performance. Stage 3 : Subject matter experts derived minimum performance standards. Results We developed single person simulations of the key physical tasks required of UK FRS personnel as criterion and <b>selection</b> <b>tests</b> (Rural Fire, Domestic Fire, Ladder Lift, Ladder Extension, Ladder Climb, Pump Assembly, Enclosed Space Search). <b>Selection</b> <b>tests</b> were marginally stronger predictors of criterion test performance (r= 0. 88 – 0. 94, 95...|$|R
