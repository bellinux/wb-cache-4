5000|$|Hemaris diffinis, the <b>snowberry</b> <b>clearwing,</b> is a moth of {{the order}} Lepidoptera, family Sphingidae. This moth is {{sometimes}} called [...] "hummingbird moth" [...] or [...] "flying lobster". This moth {{should not be confused}} with the hummingbird hawk-moth of Europe.|$|E
50|$|The plant {{serves as}} a larval host for the <b>Snowberry</b> <b>Clearwing,</b> Hemaris diffinis, and Hummingbird Clearwing, Hemaris thysbe, moths. These moths are pollinators that {{resemble}} small hummingbirds. The plant {{can be used for}} various purposes. The most used parts are the seeds, the root and the bark.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} {{is rare in}} this species, which undergoes vegetative reproduction by sprouting repeatedly from its rhizome. The formation of seed is inhibited when the plant is shaded in the understory. It is dependent on pollinators for fertilization. The most effective pollinator is the bee Anthophora ursina, and the bumblebee Bombus pennsylvanicus is generally the first pollinator to visit the flowers in an early-bloom season. Other insects that visit the plant include the butterflies Juvenal's Duskywing (Erynnis juvenalis) and <b>Snowberry</b> <b>Clearwing</b> (Hemaris diffinis) and the eastern carpenter bee (Xylocopa virginica). Research suggests the plant is not pollinated by insects often enough to have an optimum fruit yield. Surprisingly, a genetic analysis of the species revealed a moderate level of genetic diversity, a level higher than would be expected for a rare narrow endemic plant that favors vegetative reproduction as much as this one.|$|E
