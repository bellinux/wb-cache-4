Everywhere we find somewhat the same greatness, somewhat the same infirmities. In his poems and plays there are the same unaccountable protervities that have already astonished us in the romances. There, too, is the same feverish <b>strength,</b> <b>welding</b> the fiery iron of his idea under forge-hammer repetitions - an emphasis that is somehow akin to weaknesses - strength that is a little epileptic. He stands so far above all his contemporaries, and so incomparably excels them in richness, breadth, variety, and moral earnestness, that we almost feel as if he had a sort of right to fall oftener and more heavily than others; but this does not reconcile us to seeing him profit by the privilege so freely. We like to have, in our great men, something that is above question; we like to place an implicit faith in them, and see them always on the platform of their greatness; and this, unhappily, cannot be with Hugo. As Heine said long ago, his is a genius somewhat deformed; but, deformed as it is, we accept it gladly; we shall have the wisdom to see where his foot slips, but we shall have the justice also to recognise in him one of the greatest artists of our generation, and, in many ways, one of the greatest artists of time. If we look back, yet once, upon these five romances, we see blemishes such as we can lay to the charge of no other man in the number of the famous; but to what other man can we attribute such sweeping innovations, such a new and significant presentment of the life of man, such an amount, if we merely think of the amount, of equally consummate performance? ...|$|E

The quality of the joint can be defined in terms of mechanical properties, distortion and weld-bead geometry. Generally, all welding processes are employed with the aim of obtaining a welded joint with the desired characteristics. The {{purpose of this study is}} to propose a method to decide near optimal settings for the welding process parameters in friction welding of (AISI 904 L) super austenitic stainless steel by using non conventional techniques and genetic algorithm (GA).

40|$|As {{a result}} of new {{policies}} related to global warming announced by the European Union, avoiding unnecessary energy waste and reducing environmental pollution levels are becoming {{a major issue in}} the automotive industry. Accordingly, the lap welding of Zn-coated steels process, which is commonly used for producing car doors, has been gradually developed to lap welding of Zn-coated steel to light materials, such as Al alloy, Mg alloy and composite materials, in order to effectively reduce the vehicle weight. In certain part of car manufacture, organic glues are used to temporally join the Zn-coated steels and Al alloys before permanent welding takes place. The stability of such temporary joining by glues needs improving. Laser "stitching" or low <b>strength</b> <b>welding</b> could be considered as an alternative. However, challenges exist in joining Zn-coated steel on Al alloy by laser welding, due to significant differences of material properties between the two welding materials. Porosity, spatter and intermetallic brittle phases are readily produced in the weld. In this study, the effects of welding speed, laser power, number of the welding passes and type of shielding gas in gap-free welding of Zn-coated steel on Al alloy were investigated using a 1 kW single mode continuous wave fibre laser. Results show that a weld with higher shear strengths in the laser stitching application and less intermetallic phases could be obtained when nitrogen gas was used as the shielding gas. The corrosion resistance and the surface finish of the weld could be improved in double pass welding, especially when argon gas was used as the shielding gas.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Capacitor {{discharge}} welding (CDW) is a rapid solidification joining process {{under the}} influence of one-dimensional thermal gradients. Although CDW is useful for joining small parts and dissimilar metals, CD welded joints have a large variability in <b>weld</b> <b>strength.</b> CDW is not widely accepted {{because of a lack of}} automated process control.
