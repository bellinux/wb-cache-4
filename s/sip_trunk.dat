40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the use of}} SS 7 signaling system over IP networks by using the open source PBX YATE. At first it starts with describing the SS 7 followed by {{an explanation of the}} function of each of its levels and the messages that are used within the SS 7 network. The study then sheds some light on the ways of using SS 7 inside IP network with the use of some protocols. It also discusses the architecture of YATE and its files, and how it is installed in Linux operating system. Finally, it describes the important files for delivering this task. The study was commenced by using two virtual machines that have two different open source PBX's which are YATE and Asterisk, and after acquiring some results by establishing communication between them via the means of <b>SIP</b> <b>trunk,</b> furthermore the study was extended to the laboratory in order to test it over real servers that have TDM cards, in order to apply the study by the means of SS 7 protocols, SIGTRAN, MGCP gateway and SIP-T. The experiments have almost delivered successful communications after conducting a configuration for the files on multiple sides...|$|E
40|$|The master’s thesis {{presents}} routing protocols, SIP handshake, describes modern VoIP {{networks and}} its features. Thesis is primary focused on networks with integrated MPLS. The most known {{advantages and disadvantages}} were described of modern network based on such technology. Further, networks and a router with installed Cisco Call Manager Express 7. 1 were configured, which is provided by CISCO. For recreating of fully working telephone network IP PBX 10 has been used from SMC Networks. For connection between different phones within these integrated networks, <b>SIP</b> <b>trunk</b> was configured on SMC PBX 10 {{as well as on}} router, which is connecting three configured Cisco IP phones. Each phone has its own number according to the dial plan. For calls from one network to another the special pattern has been established, so the number of each caller can be easily identified by added digit. On one of the CISCO routers was shown a configuration of MPLS and OSPF protocols. With an analyzer VePAL TX 300 e, the lab network has been measured to analyze QoS parameters of the network according to standard RFC 2544. Thesis also gives references to lab devices, which have been used accordingly to the work...|$|E
