2500|$|Advanced {{statistical}} techniques (loosely {{known as}} deep learning), access to {{large amounts of}} data and faster computers enabled advances in machine learning and perception. By the mid 2010s, machine learning applications were used throughout the world. In a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin. The Kinect, which provides a 3D bodyâ€“motion interface for the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One use algorithms that emerged from lengthy AI research as do intelligent personal assistants in smartphones. In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee <b>Sedol,</b> becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. In the 2017 Future of Go Summit, [...] AlphaGo [...] won a three-game match with Ke Jie, {{who at the time}} continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years. This marked the completion of a significant milestone in the development of Artificial Intelligence as Go is an extremely complex game, more so than Chess.|$|E
