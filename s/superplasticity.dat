50|$|The {{mechanisms}} of <b>superplasticity</b> in metals {{are still under}} debate—many believe it relies on atomic diffusion and the sliding of grains past each other.

50|$|To begin with, the {{material}} is heated up to promote <b>superplasticity.</b> For titanium alloys e.g. Ti 6Al 4V and some stainless steels this is around 900 C and for aluminium alloys e.g. AA5083 it is between 450-520 °C. In this state {{the material}} becomes soft so processes that are usually used on plastics can be applied, such as: thermoforming, blow forming, and vacuum forming. Inert gas pressure is applied on the superplastic sheet forcing it into a female die.|$|E
50|$|High-strain-rate <b>superplasticity</b> {{has been}} {{observed}} in aluminium-based and magnesium-based alloys. But for ceramic materials, superplastic deformation has been restricted to low strain rates for most oxides, and nitrides {{with the presence of}} cavities leading to premature failure. Here we show that a composite ceramic material consisting of tetragonal zirconium oxide, magnesium aluminates spinal and alpha-alumina phase exhibit <b>superplasticity</b> at strain rates up to 1.0 s−1. The composite also exhibits a large tensile elongation, exceeding 1050% or a strain rate of 0.4 s−1.Superplastic metals and ceramics have the ability to deform over 100% without fracturing, permitting net-shape forming at high temperatures. These intriguing materials deform primarily by grain boundary sliding, a process accelerated with a fine grain size. However, most ceramics that start with a fine grain size experience rapid grain growth during high temperature deformation, rendering them unsuitable for extended superplastic forming. One can limit grain growth using a minor second phase (Zener pinning) or by making a ceramic with three phases, where grain to grain contact of the same phase is minimized. A research on fine grain three phase alumina-mullite(3Al2O3•2SiO2)-zirconia, with approximately equal volume fractions of the three phases, demonstrates that superplastic strain rates as high as 10−2/sec at 1500 °C can be reached. These high strain rates put ceramic superplastic forming into the realm of commercial feasibility.|$|E

5000|$|In {{materials}} science, <b>superplasticity</b> is a {{state in}} which solid crystalline material is deformed well beyond its usual breaking point, usually over about 200% during tensile deformation. Such a state is usually achieved at high homologous temperature. Examples of superplastic materials are some fine-grained metals and ceramics. Other non-crystalline materials (amorphous) such as silica glass ("molten glass") and polymers also deform similarly, but are not called superplastic, {{because they are not}} crystalline; rather, their deformation is often described as Newtonian fluid. Superplastically deformed material gets thinner in a very uniform manner, rather than forming a [...] "neck" [...] (a local narrowing) that leads to fracture.
