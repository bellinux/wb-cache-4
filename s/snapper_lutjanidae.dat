Rockfishes display great range in length at maturity (9 - 52 cm total length) and estimated fecundity at maturity (1, 700 - 417, 000 eggs or embryos). Within species, length at maturity usually increases at higher latitudes and tends to be greater for females than males. Among species, length at maturity of females is positively and significantly correlated with maximum length and with the ratio of fecundity at maturity to fecundity at maximum length.

The shoreline boundaries of STXEEMP include numerous beaches, salt ponds and mangrove habitats. Great Pond, {{located at the}} southwestern shoreline boundary, {{is one of the}} largest remaining mangrove tracts on the island. The seagrass meadows (principally composed of the seagrass species Thalassia testudinum and Syringodium filiforme) provide nursery and foraging areas for a variety of species of reef fish, stingrays, conch and other invertebrates. [...] Seagrass beds also serve to anchor sand, and retain nutrients and sediment that wash down from the land. [...] Reefs provide shelter and foraging habitat for reef species, many of which are commercially important, either as a tourist attraction, a fishery or both. [...] Mangroves serve as nurseries and shelter for juvenile fish, a catchment and filter for runoff and sediments, and provide critical shoreline protection from strong weather events. [...] The mangrove habitat of Great Pond in particular also supports a large diversity of wintering shorebirds, and nesting habitat for resident species such as Least Tern Sterna antillarum, White-crowned Pigeons Patagioenas leucocephala (IUCN Near Threatened), Green-throated Carib Eulampis holosericeus, and a diversity of heron, egret and shorebird species.

40|$|Vascular {{corrosion}} casting {{is defined}} as a tissue preparation technique that involves injecting a resin (typically plastic) into blood vessels or other hollow viscera and treating the tissue with a caustic substance resulting in a negative copy of the enclosed space (Aharinejad and Lametschmandtner, 1992; Motta et al., 1992). Since its development in the 1930 ’s there have been many resins developed and marketed to the scientific and medical communities with each type having pros and cons that have never been listed or compared (Vollmerhaus 2002; Aharinejad and Lametschwandtner, 1992; Motta et al., 1992). Cast attributes were drawn from multiple sources including peer reviewed scientific journal papers and manufacturer descriptions and data sheets, as well as personal experience using the resin types to cast the vasculature of several species of <b>snapper</b> (<b>Lutjanidae).</b> The Mercox II resin developed by Ladd Research Industries Inc. (Burlington, Vermont, USA) had traits that make it the best resin for general use in vascular corrosion casting studies of fish vasculature.

The relative index of reef-fish abundance resulting from these annual Gulf-wide surveys is based on counts of fish recorded during a 1 h set of a video camera on the bottom. During the 1993 reef-fish survey, a total of 115 reef sites were sampled with a video camera and fisheries acoustic system. Video data were used to identify fish species distributed above the bottom.

40|$|Red bass, Lutjanus bohar, {{is a large}} {{tropical}} <b>snapper</b> (<b>Lutjanidae)</b> that is harvested {{to varying}} extents throughout a widespread Indo-Pacific distribution. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate vital life history characteristics (age, growth, maturity) of red bass on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, relevant to its management. The maximum estimated age of 55 + years is the oldest reported for any tropical snapper to date. The sampling of red bass from different depth ranges resulted in different age frequency distributions, suggesting that many older red bass reside at greater depths. The fit of the von Bertalanffy growth model described a trend of relatively slow growth: LF (fork length; mm) = 630 × (1 − e− 0. 10 t+ 3. 05), with no significant difference in fitted parameter estimates between males and females. Female red bass matured at a much larger size (L 50 = 428 mm) and older age (t 50 = 9. 39 years) than males (L 50 < 300 mm, t 50 = 1. 46 years) and were reproductively active over many months, from August to April. These results suggest that the red bass has a relatively K-selected life history strategy among the tropical snappers, and fish in general. This type of life history strategy predicts slow rates of turnover and a susceptibility of red bass populations to rapid over-exploitation...|$|E
40|$|Long-term fishery {{datasets}} {{can provide}} valuable insights into fishing histories, and represent a baseline against which to examine current status {{and plan for}} future management. For coral reef-associated fisheries, however, such datasets are extremely rare. We analyse a unique 45 -year set of landings data on six reef fishes of commercial importance in Cuba's coastal fisheries, together with information on management interventions, and examine the likely implications of over-fishing and management on the long-term condition of one grouper (Serranidae) and five <b>snapper</b> (<b>Lutjanidae)</b> species. The data clearly demonstrate differential responses to fishing and management according to the biology of the different species examined. In particular, those species that aggregate most predictably, and at {{a small number of}} spawning sites, are more prone to uncontrolled fishing and in need of effective management. The increase in the number and severity of management measures over the last 20 years reflects attempts to address declines in the fishery following its development prior to the 1980 s. The data suggest short-lived successes, and challenges to successful management from changing socio-economic circumstances and environmental impacts. The importance of considering, in addition to landings information, social and economic factors, management history, the biology of targeted species and the implications of environmental factors in relation to resource use, trends, and management is clearly illustrated in this study. Managers should strive to document species-specific data over the long-term and aim for robust and adaptive fishery management that constantly adjusts to the range of factors that affect fishing activity, exploited species, and responses to management. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{cleaning}} behaviour of the bluestreak cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus is extensively {{used as a}} {{model system}} for understanding cooperation. It feeds mainly on blood-sucking gnathiid isopods and also on the epidermal mucus of client fish; the nutritional quality of these foods, however, is unknown. The epidermal mucus of reef fish contains ultraviolet (UV) -absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids, MAAs), which are only obtained via the diet; nevertheless, while La. dimidiatus has high amounts of MAAs in its mucus, their source is unknown. Therefore, the energetic value (calories and protein estimated using carbon and nitrogen) and MAA level in gnathiids and mucus from several clients [parrotfishes, wrasses (Labridae), and a <b>snapper</b> (<b>Lutjanidae)</b> ] were determined. The energetic value of mucus and gnathiids varied among fishes. Overall, carbon, nitrogen, calories, and protein per dry weight {{were higher in the}} mucus of most client species compared to gnathiids. Thus, depending on the client species, mucus may be energetically more advantageous for cleaner wrasse to feed on than gnathiids. UV absorbance, a confirmed proxy for MAA levels, indicated high MAA levels in mucus, whereas gnathiids had no detectable MAAs. This suggests that La. dimidiatus obtain MAAs from mucus but not from gnathiids. Hence, in addition to energy, the mucus of some clients also provides La. dimidiatus with the added bonus of UV-absorbing compounds. This may explain why cleaner fish prefer to feed on mucus over gnathiid isopods. The likely costs and benefits to clients of the removal of UV protecting mucus and parasitic gnathiids, respectively, and the variation in benefits gained by cleaner fish from feeding on these foods may explain some variation in cooperation levels in cleaning interactions...|$|E
40|$|Coastal {{development}} in Banten Bay, Indonesia, decreased seagrass coverage to only 1. 5 % of its surface area. We investigated {{the importance of}} seagrass as habitat for juvenile groupers (Serranidae) and <b>snappers</b> (<b>Lutjanidae),</b> by performing beam trawl hauls {{on a weekly basis}} in two seagrass locations and one mudflat area, and monthly trawl hauls in three different microhabitats (dense, mixed and patchy seagrass) in one of the seagrass locations. We studied the effects of location and microhabitat, as well as temporal patterns (diel, weekly and monthly) on the probability of occurrence and abundance of the most abundant grouper (Orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides) and snapper (Russell¿s snapper, Lutjanus russellii). We found that both species were almost exclusively found in seagrass locations, with a preference for microhabitats of high complexity (dense and mixed microhabitats). L. russellii had a higher probability of catch and abundance during the night, most probably because of its ability to avoid the beam trawl during daytime sampling. In addition there was an effect of week and month on the presence and abundance of both species, but patterns were unclear, probably because of high fishing pressure on juvenile groupers and snappers by push net fishermen. Groupers and snappers mainly fed on abundant shrimps, {{and to a lesser extent}} on fish. Moreover, juveniles find protection against predators in seagrass, which confirmed the critical role of quantity and quality of seagrass areas for juvenile groupers and snappers in Banten Bay...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{adaptive}} radiation, {{according to which}} a biological lineage undergoes elevated rates of species diversification {{while at the same}} time experiencing divergence along ecological axis, is often invoked in evolutionary studies to explain the astonishing diversity of groups such as the cichlids of the African rift lakes, silverswords plants and honeycreeper birds in Hawaii, and anole lizards in the Neotropics. Recent surveys of the scientific literature, however, revealed that most studies of adaptive radiation do not recover the expected signal of early burst of lineage diversification, and in several animal groups rates of cladogenesis and phenotypic evolution may often be unlinked, thus creating complex patterns in the tempo of lineage and trait diversification. Furthermore, in spite of the dramatic increase in number of studies of the tempo and mode of evolution in marine fishes during the past decade, very little evidence has been uncovered to support the idea that adaptive radiations played a role in generating their staggering diversity, and even when a signal of radiation is recovered this virtually never conforms to the “traditional” early burst scenario. Using examples from our research on diverse groups of marine teleost fishes such as jacks and allies (Carangoidei), pufferfish and allies (Tetraodontiformes) and <b>snappers</b> (<b>Lutjanidae),</b> we will discuss why it is so difficult to recover a signal of adaptive radiation in general, and early burst in particular, and offer some suggestions on how to test for these patterns.

40|$|Although {{the impacts}} of {{industrial}} fishing are widely recognized, marine ecosystems are generally considered less threatened by artisanal fisheries. To determine how coral reef fish assemblages and benthic communities are affected by artisanal fishing, we studied six Caribbean islands on which fishing pressure ranged from virtually none in Bonaire, increasing through Saba, Puerto Rico, St Lucia, and Dominica, and reaching very high intensities in Jamaica. Using stationary-point fish counts at 5 m and 15 m depth, we counted and estimated the lengths of all noncryptic, diurnal fish species within replicate 10 -m-diameter areas. We estimated percent cover of coral and algae and determined reef structural complexity. From fish numbers and lengths we calculated mean fish biomass per count for the five most commercially important families. Groupers (Serranidae), <b>snappers</b> (<b>Lutjanidae),</b> parrotfish (Scaridae), and surgeonfish (Acanthuridae) showed order-of-magnitude differences in biomass among islands. Biomass fell as fishing pressure increased. Only grunts (Haemulidae) did not follow this pattern. Within families, larger-bodied species decreased as fishing intensified. Coral cover and structural complexity were highest on little-fished islands and lowest on those most fished. By contrast, algal cover was {{an order of magnitude}} higher in Jamaica than in Bonaire. These results suggest that following the Caribbean-wide mass mortality of herbivorous sea urchins in 1983 – 1984 and consequent declines in grazing pressure on reefs, herbivorous fishes have not controlled algae overgrowing corals in heavily fished areas but have restricted growth in lightly fished areas. In summary, differences among islands in the structure of fish and benthic assemblages suggest that intensive artisanal fishing has transformed Caribbean reefs. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of Puerto Rican Regulation No. 6768, which overhauled the existing fishery management framework, generated considerable hostility towards local managers. Among the controversial management measures adopted in 2004 were {{the assignment of}} fishing licenses based on fishing income, the establishment of closed seasons, and new minimum size restrictions for commercially valuable species. Though tensions have subsided, considerable opposition to these regulations remains. This paper provides a characterization of the current population of active small-scale fishermen, discusses their perceptions about the biological and socio-economic condition of the fishery, and describes their attitudes towards the new management framework. This study revealed {{that the number of}} active fishermen decreased from 1, 731 in 1988 to 868 in 2008. Although a declining resource base {{was one of the main}} drivers behind these waning participation statistics, rising fuel costs and burdensome regulations exacerbated the rate of attrition. The majority of the fishermen were middleaged men (50 years) with moderate levels of formal education and high levels of fishing dependence which limited their employment opportunities outside the fishery. Most of the vessels were small (20 ft) and outfitted with a single outboard engine (80 hp). Hook and line and SCUBA were dominant gears because of their versatility and cost effectiveness. Fishermen suggested that their opposition to the regulations would continue unless they were afforded greater regulatory flexibility and provided with a larger role in the decision-making process. Fishermen were adamant about the need to reconsider the income reporting requirements to secure a fishing license because of the potential for losing public assistance benefits. They also objected to increasing the minimum size of many deepwater <b>snapper</b> (<b>Lutjanidae)</b> and grouper (Serranidae) species because it forced them to discard dead fish, a practice they consider wasteful since these species do not survive the ascent to the surface once hooked...|$|E
40|$|Coastal {{infrastructure}} {{has replaced}} many vital fish nursery habitats with structures designed without fully mitigating {{for the loss}} of the natural ecosystems. This thesis details research focused on the use of small, inexpensive, artificial reef modules as replacement juvenile fish habitat within marinas. My research hypothesis was that the placement of small, structurally complex artificial reef modules would increase fish abundance and species richness relative to unmodified marina seawalls. Non-destructive visual surveys of fishes were completed monthly for 14 months for 12 artificial reef sites and 12 control (unmodified) sites within the Nova Southeastern University Guy Harvey Oceanographic Center (NSU-GHOC) marina. Divers recorded species, abundance, and size class (0 - 2 cm, 3 ̆e 2 - 5 cm, 3 ̆e 5 - 10 cm, 3 ̆e 10 - 20 cm, 3 ̆e 20 - 30 cm, 3 ̆e 30 - 50 cm, 3 ̆e 50 cm) for all sites. Data was statistically analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc Student Newman-Keuls (SNK) tests to explore differences in mean abundance, mean species richness, and mean abundance and species richness by size class and month. Total mean fish abundance and mean species richness (all months and sizes combined) were both significantly higher at artificial reef sites than at control sites. Artificial reef sites were consistently higher in total abundance and species richness when analyzed by month. Analysis of mean abundance by size class found the 3 ̆e 2 - 5 cm, 3 ̆e 5 - 10 cm, 3 ̆e 10 - 20 cm and 3 ̆e 20 - 30 cm classes were significantly higher for artificial reef sites. Species richness analysis by size class found classes 3 ̆e 2 - 5 cm, 3 ̆e 5 - 10 cm, 3 ̆e 10 - 20 cm, and 3 ̆e 20 - 30 cm were significantly higher at artificial reef sites. Fishes from the grunt (Haemulidae) and <b>snapper</b> (<b>Lutjanidae)</b> families contributed the most to the total abundance for both types of sites.

The objective {{of the study was}} to define the movements of reef fishes among habitats within and between the Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument (VICRNM), the Virgin Islands National Park (VIIS), and Territorial waters surrounding St. John. In order to better understand species’ habitat utilization patterns among management regimes, we deployed an array of hydroacoustic receivers and acoustically tagged reef fishes. Thirty six receivers were deployed in shallow near-shore bays and across the shelf to depths of approximately 30 m. One hundred eighty four individual fishes were tagged representing 19 species from 10 different families with VEMCO V 9 - 2 L-R 64 K transmitters. The array provides fish movement information at fine (e. g., day-night and 100 s meters within a bay) to broad spatial and temporal scales (multiple years and 1000 s meters across the shelf). The long term multi-year tracking project provides direct evidence of connectivity across habitat types in the seascape and among management units. An important finding for management was that a number of individuals moved among management units (VICRNM, VINP, Territorial waters) and several snapper moved from near-shore protected areas to offshore shelf-edge spawning aggregations. However, most individuals spent the majority of their time with VIIS and VICRNM, with only a few wide-ranging species moving outside the management units.

40|$|Shifts in catch {{composition}} were {{registered in the}} Eritrean artisanal fisheries, which were launched into a renewed development {{after the end of}} the independence war in 1991. Our analysis of catch and effort data showed that total fishing effort as well as total annual catch increased more than two-fold from 1996 to 2002. Yet, overall CPUE remained unchanged upon the expansion of the fisheries, suggesting that the fisheries are still at an early stage of development. However, at lower taxonomic level, we found that the CPUE for emperors (Lethrinidae), <b>snappers</b> (<b>Lutjanidae),</b> and sharks (Elasmobranchii) decreased, while the CPUE for barracudas (Sphyraenidae), jacks (Carangidae), and tunas (Scombridae) increased. Thus, the species composition of the catches shifted toward a smaller proportion of high-value demersals (from ca. 70 % in 1996 to ca. 30 % in 2002), implying a change in the underlying fish community structure. Changes in CPUE could not be attributed to changes in spatial effort allocation, or to changes in gear or boats used, ruling out changes in fishing strategies as likely causes. Yet the decline in CPUE at low fishing effort does not necessarily reflect a proportional decline in fish abundance, and could possibly be caused by ¿hyperdepletion¿. Nevertheless, the trends in CPUE are consistent with earlier findings that stocks of reef-associated demersal fishes are highly vulnerable to fishing and can decline even at the early stages of the fisheries. Therefore, the changes in CPUE could indeed represent true biomass changes, with potentially important ecological consequences. These effects could even become more severe if market conditions improve, leading to activation of latent fishing capacity, which was found to make up about 75 % of the registered fleet...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the potential of}} habitat connectivity to promote the effectiveness of marine reserves. We used heterogeneous reef seascapes as a model system to examine the potential interaction of reserves and mangrove-reef connectivity and compared the magnitude of these effects across the western Pacific Ocean. Location: The tropical and subtropical western Pacific, including the Solomon Islands, Great Barrier Reef and Moreton Bay, Australia. Methods: We quantified fish densities on coral reefs (38 sites) and in mangrove forests (19 sites) across seven marine reserves and twelve unprotected control locations. Fish assemblages were in seascapes supporting either adjacent reefs and mangroves or isolated reefs. For each reserve-control comparison, we evaluated the potential interactive effects of habitat connectivity on species richness and densities of harvested species, functional groups, families and individual species. We then examined the influence of spatial variation in reserve attributes, seascape heterogeneity and latitude on the magnitude of reserve-connectivity effects. Results: <b>Snappers</b> (<b>Lutjanidae)</b> and rabbitfish (Siganidae) were more abundant on reserve reefs close to mangroves in all regions. These interactive effects also enhanced the abundance of sweetlip (Haemulidae), bream (Sparidae), harvested fish, herbivores and piscivores and species richness {{in two of the}} three regions examined. Spatial variation in the magnitude of reserve-connectivity effects was explained by differences among reserves in seascape variables (i. e. area of mangroves and reef, duration of mangrove inundation and distance to rivers) but not by reserve attributes (i. e. age, size, poaching) or latitude. Main conclusions: Habitat connectivity improved the effectiveness of reserves across the western Pacific Ocean. We recommend that heterogeneous landscapes with high-habitat connectivity should be viewed as high priorities for conservation. By improving our understanding of connectivity, and through its explicit incorporation into conservation, we may have greater success in restoring biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Growth stanzas or abrupt {{changes in}} growth rates are present {{throughout}} {{the life span}} of fish. Identifying growth stanzas will help to adequately described growth taking into account that fishes are indeterminate growers. In this study, we used length-weight (L-W) relationships to analyze the growth stanzas in the Grouper-Snapper complex of Southern Gulf of Mexico. For this, the type of sexuality, sex and different sexual maturity phase were considered in the analyses of three species of gonochoric <b>Snappers</b> (<b>Lutjanidae)</b> and six species of protogynous hermaphrodite Groupers (Epinephelidae). Welch ANOVA tests were carried out to determine the existence of differences in length and weight between juveniles and adults per sex. According to the observed differences, L-W relationship parameters (a and b), standard error (SE b) and coefficients of determination (R 2) were calculated for all species separately by sex and sexual maturity phase. Snappers’ juvenile-females b-value ranged for 2. 44 - 2. 77, juvenile-males from 2. 16 - 2. 94, adult-females from 2. 63 - 2. 80 and adult-males form 2. 63 - 2. 98. Groupers’ b-value ranged for juvenile-females 2. 66 - 3. 20, adult-females from 2. 73 - 3. 31 and for adult-males 2. 93 - 3. 29. For each relationship b-value was t-tested (t-Student) to explore differences from the allometric coefficient (b= 3), which indicated changes in body form. Hypothesis test, for regression slopes (b) between Snappers’ juvenile-females vs. adult-females and juvenile-males vs. adult-males and Groupers’ juvenile-females vs. adult-females and adult-females vs. adult-males, indicated different growth stanzas related to gonadal development for Snappers, and to gonadal development and sex change in Groupers. The identification of growth stanzas is crucial to avoid an overestimation or misleading growth rate which is used in fisheries management to establish some target reference points, such as maximum sustainable yield or yield-per-recruit...|$|R
40|$|Although {{information}} on the spawning seasons of commercially important <b>snappers</b> (<b>Lutjanidae)</b> and groupers (Serranidae, subfamily Epinephelinae) is available for the north and central west Atlantic, there is little information for the tropical western South Atlantic (Brazil). As a consequence, there are few fishery regulations in this entire region that take into consideration such information. In this study, we characterized the reproductive cycles of three Epinephelinae serranids (Epinephelus morio, Mycteroperca bonaci and Cephalopholis fulva) and five lutjanids (Lutjanus synagris, L. jocu, L. analis, Ocyurus chrysurus and Rhomboplites aurorubens) {{that occur in the}} Abrolhos Bank, Brazil, the largest reef complex in the tropical western South Atlantic. A total of 3528 gonads were collected from May 2005 to October 2007. Temporal variability in spawning patterns was evaluated using the Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) and macroscopic analyses. The peak of reproductive activity for the three grouper species occurred between July and August. Snappers exhibited two peaks of reproductive activity, the more intense of which occurred between September and October. The other peak occurred between February and March, {{with the exception of the}} deep-dwelling species R. aurorubens, which only reproduced between February and March. Seasonal patterns were consistent over the two consecutive years that we studied, and these patterns are equivalent to those observed for the Northern Hemisphere, as are the sizes at maturity and at the time of sexual change (for the three protogynous hermaphrodite groupers). Fisheries management in this region could be significantly improved by a combination of catch and effort limitations being imposed during spawning seasons and by overall size limitations, particularly considering that most of the fish caught are generally below size at maturity. The proposed buffer zones for the marine areas that are presently protected in Abrolhos represent an opportunity for implementing both spatial (e. g. setting no-take zones that cover spawning sites) and temporal (e. g. seasonal closures during spawning peaks) management tools, using a participatory approach at the regional scale...|$|R
40|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} of 27 species of common Indo-Pacific <b>snappers</b> (<b>Lutjanidae)</b> were explored using the 16 S ribosomal RNA and cytochrome b mitochondrial genes with minimum evolution, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses. Included were species representing four subfamilies, the Caesioninae, Etelinae, Paradicichthyinae, and Lutjaninae. Members of the closely related families Haemulidae, Lethrinidae, Nemipteridae and Sparidae, were included for outgroup comparisons {{and to explore}} {{the relationships between the}} Haemuloidea, Lutjanoidea and Sparoidea. Monophyly of the Lutjanidae was resolved. The Caesioninae was nested within the Lutjaninae, supporting the recent view that the Caesionidae should be treated as a synonym of the Lutjanidae. The subfamilies Etelinae and Paradicichthyinae were resolved as sister taxa to the remainder of the Lutjanidae, which corroborates previous cladistic analyses conducted to determine {{relationships of}} lutjanid subfamilies. Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses suggest that Macolor is the sister taxon to the Caesioninae and may represent a transitional form between the Lutjaninae and Caesioninae. Three species of Western Atlantic lutjanids, Lutjanus campechanus, L. synagris, and Rhomboplites aurorubens, were included in the analyses to examine their relationships to Indo-Pacific species; they formed a well-supported clade nested within Pacific lutjanines suggesting that Atlantic species of Lutjaninae are derived from an Indo-Pacific lineage. Results of our molecular phylogenetic analyses are congruent with the general morphology and external colouration of the resolved groups of species of Lutjanus. The "black spot" complex containing L. fulviflamma, L. monostigma, and L. russelli was resolved with strong support, and had L. carponotatus nested within. The morphology of L. carponotatus suggests a close relationship to this group, and the lack of the black spot near the lateral line below the soft dorsal fin is possibly a secondary loss. As expected, the "blue-lined" species, L. kasmira and L. quinquelineatus, formed a strongly supported clade. Lutjanus bohar and L. gibbus, both distinctly red, long-lived fish that often accumulate large quantities of ciguatera toxin in their tissues, were resolved as sister taxa. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Illegal, unreported and {{unregulated}} (IUU) {{fishing and}} seafood supply chain fraud are multifaceted problems that demand multifaceted solutions. Here, we investigate {{the extent to}} which global fisheries trade data analyses can support effective seafood traceability and promote sustainable seafood markets using one of the world’s most highly prized, yet misunderstood, groups of fishes as a model: the <b>snappers,</b> family <b>Lutjanidae.</b> By collating and comparing production, import and export data from international and national statistical collections for the period 2006 – 2013, we show that official trade data severely lack the level of detail required to track snapper trade flows, uncover potential IUU activities and/or inform exploitation management of snappers and related species. Moreover, we contend that the lack of taxonomic granularity and use of vague generic names in trade records represent one of the most insidious impediments to seafood traceability, and suggest that widely used harmonised commodity classification systems should evolve to address these gaps...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{evaluations}} of early-life connectivity in reef fish populations {{are critical to}} the effective identification and management of productive nearshore nurseries. The present study evaluates the use of natural markers in assessing both trophic and population connectivity for three species of <b>snappers</b> (<b>Lutjanidae)</b> utilizing back-reef nurseries in southern Belize: dog snapper (Lutjanus jocu), gray snapper (L. griseus), and schoolmaster (L. apodus). Juvenile snappers were collected from inner- and outer-shelf nurseries across two latitudinal regions in the Belize coastal lagoon in order to: (a) utilize tissue stable isotopes (?^(13) C and ?^(15) N) as dietary tracers to characterize organic matter production across the continental shelf, and (b) evaluate the utility of otolith stable isotopes (?^(13) C and ?^(18) O) as a marker of nursery origin. Isosource models (based on tissue ?^(13) C and ?^(15) N) revealed distinct differences in food web dynamics between pristine nurseries and those influenced by heavily impacted watersheds. Juvenile snappers at pristine sites were supported by organic matter derived from both benthic sources (seagrass/benthic diatoms) and the water column (phytoplankton), while sites impacted by anthropogenic runoff displayed significant decreases in water column-based production during the rainy season, accompanied by significantly decreased juvenile snapper condition (muscle lipid content) for all three species. These results emphasize the high land-sea connectivity in this system and indicate that runoff from impacted watersheds {{has the potential to}} disrupt trophic production in nurseries across the continental shelf. Otolith stable isotopes (?^(13) C and ?^(18) O) appeared to be strongly related to salinity gradients within the Belize coastal lagoon and, consequently, showed considerable promise in identifying juvenile snappers to shelf position. Both isotopes were both consistently enriched in snappers from outer-shelf nurseries, where freshwater influence was minimal, and ?^(18) O was enriched in the northern sampling region, which receives lower amounts of freshwater input compared to the south. Although individuals of each species were classified to specific study sites with varying success (58 - 81 %), discrimination to shelf position was consistently high for all species (74 - 92 %), indicating that otolith ?^(13) C and ?^(18) O may be useful in determining relative contribution rates of juvenile snappers produced at inner- and outer-shelf nurseries within tropical back-reef systems...|$|R
40|$|Opakapaka (Pristipomoidesfilamentosus) is a <b>snapper</b> (family <b>Lutjanidae)</b> {{native to}} the waters around Hawaii. Recent {{population}} declines of this commercially important species have increased interest {{in the culture of}} this fish. Survival of this fish through the larval period in culture has been consistently low, usually not exceeding 2 %. The aim of this thesis was to provide an extensive diagnostic report of diseases affecting opakapaka larvae in culture. Opakapaka larvae mortality was found {{to be the result of}} a synergy of factors including larvae development stage, larvae nutrition, environmental conditions, and the presence of infectious agents. During culture, high larval mortalities occur around first feeding and around a period of rapid development. Crucial periods of development in both the digestive system and the respiratory system coincided with these catastrophic mortality events. It is therefore suspected that failure to complete the progression of development from one stage to the next is partially responsible for low larvae survival. A large proportion of opakapaka surviving to the juvenile stage had deformed jaws andlor vertebral columns. Therefore, the development of the jaw and other skeletal elements wa...|$|R
30|$|The marine {{aquaculture}} in Malaysia has expanded significantly {{over the last}} two decades, contributing about 70  % of the total aquaculture production. Brackish water fish cage culture has received much attention over the years due to its high export demand and generated sizeable foreign exchange earnings for the country. The cage culture areas have increased from 27, 000 to 1, 741, 000  m 2 between 1982 and 2009. Production has increased from 413 to 22, 521 mt during the same period. There were about 3258 farmers involved in cage aquaculture practices in 2009 (Department of Fisheries Malaysia 2011). The Malaysian government took a number of initiatives to promote brackish water cage culture (Ministry of Agriculture 2003). The government has established the Aquaculture Industrial Zones (AIZ) in 2007. Cage culture has been identified as one of the Entry Point Project (EPP) under National Key Economic Area (NKEA) programme which is expected to contribute USD 432 million to the Malaysian Gross National Income by 2020. The floating cages are used as the main production system for marine fin fish. Various species of marine brackish water finfish are produced using the cages, including barramundi or Asian Seabass (Lates calcarifer), <b>snappers</b> (<b>Lutjanidae),</b> grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus), cobia (Rachycentron canadum), and red tilapia (Oreochromis spp). Among them, barramundi and grouper are the leading species cultured in the coastal areas. Fish cage culture system has been mostly traditional and semi-intensive in Peninsular Malaysia and mostly carried out along the coastal mangroves and relatively shallow lagoons and protected bays. Major fish cage farming has taken place in protected coastal areas in the states of Perak, Johor, Penang and Selangor. The cage culture mainly relies on fish seed or juveniles especially for the grouper collected from the wild. A number of hatcheries have been established in Malaysia to produce seed for various finfish. However, the cost of fry, feed and labour have increased significantly over the recent years. Seabass is a fast growing species which can grow at an average of 1  kg m− 1 and Tiger grouper can reach marketable size of approximately 0.5  kg m− 1 within 9 – 12  months (Rimmer et al. 2005). This size is demanded by consumers in the local market and in neighboring countries. The high value species such as grouper is exported to Hong Kong and China.|$|R

Six species of Euryhaliotrema, previously reported from lutjanid hosts, were not collected: Euryhaliotrema anguiformis comb. nov., Euryhaliotrema guangdongense, Euryhaliotrema johni, Euryhaliotrema lutiani, Euryhaliotrema lutjani, and Euryhaliotrema nanaoense comb. nov. The diagnosis of Euryhaliotrema was emended to include species having tandem or slightly overlapping gonads, a pretesticular germarium, a globose haptor with morphologically similar anchors and hooks, a coiled or meandering male copulatory organ, a dextral vaginal pore, and hooks with upright acute thumbs and slender shanks comprised of one subunit. A bulbous {{base of the}} MCO and presence of an accessory piece in the copulatory complex were no longer considered features defining the genus. As a result, Euryhaliotrematoides and Aliatrema were placed in subjective synonymy with Euryhaliotrema, and the following transfers were proposed: Euryhaliotrema annulocirrus comb. nov., Euryhaliotrema aspistis comb. nov., Euryhaliotrema berenguelae comb. nov., Euryhaliotrema cribbi comb. nov., Euryhaliotrema grandis comb. nov., Euryhaliotrema mehen comb. nov., Euryhaliotrema microphallus comb. nov., Euryhaliotrema pirulum comb. nov., and Euryhaliotrema triangulovagina comb. nov. In addition, the following new combinations were proposed based on the revised diagnosis of the genus: Euryhaliotrema anguiformis comb. nov., Euryhaliotrema eukurodai comb. nov., Euryhaliotrema kurodai comb. nov., Euryhaliotrema monoporosum comb. nov., and Euryhaliotrema nanaoense comb. nov. The dactylogyrids, Protancyrocephalus rangusi (from a lutjanid host) and Daitreosoma chaetodontis (from a chaetodontid host), were considered species inquirendae. Haliotrematoides tukerhamatus comb. nov. is considered the senior subjective synonym of Haliotrematoides nagabinae.

Fishers are then given a choice to fish using legal gears, such as handlines, or to fish with illegal gears, e. g. dynamite (for snapper) or cyanide (for grouper). Given prices and costs of legal and illegal fishing, the status quo simulations with no Regency enforcement result in {{a large amount of}} illegal catch throughout the 50 yr simulation, which agrees with expert opinion that destructive illegal fishing is occurring in the region. In an attempt to include ecosystem-based management principles into Raja Ampat governance, we introduce an enforcement regime in the form of detecting and punishing illegal fishing.
