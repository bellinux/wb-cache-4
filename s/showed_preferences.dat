Jelly beans with atypical color names, such as razzmatazz, {{were more likely to}} be chosen than jelly beans with typical names such as lemon yellow.

40|$|The Borrelia burgdorferi genome encodes five orthologues of the {{substrate}} binding protein oligopeptide permease A (OppA). It was previously shown that these genes {{are under the}} control of separate promoters and are differentially expressed under various environmental conditions. We were interested in determining whether there are also differences in substrate specificities among the proteins. The substrate specificities of recombinant proteins were determined by screening for high-affinity peptides by use of a combinatorial phage display heptapeptide library. Different heptapeptides with high affinities for OppA- 1, OppA- 2, and OppA- 3 were identified. No heptapeptide binding OppA- 4 or OppA- 5 could be identified. Competitive binding assays were performed under various conditions to determine {{the substrate}} preferences of the OppA proteins. OppA- 1 retained maximal activity over a broad range of pHs (5. 5 to 7. 5), whereas OppA- 2 and OppA- 3 showed peak activities at pHs below 5. 5. OppA- 1 and OppA- 2 <b>showed</b> <b>preferences</b> for tripeptides over dipeptides and longer-chain peptides. Although a wide variety of amino acyl side chains were tolerated by all three OppA proteins, OppA- 1 showed the broadest substrate specificity and was able to accommodate peptides composed of bulky hydrophobic residues; OppA- 2 and OppA- 3 <b>showed</b> <b>preferences</b> for peptides composed of small nonpolar amino acids. All three OppA proteins <b>showed</b> <b>preferences</b> for peptides composed of L- rather than D-amino acids. OppA- 3 showed the greatest tolerance for changes in stereochemistry.

40|$|This study {{examined}} how 3 and 5 -year-old children initially interpreted novel verbs {{and how they}} modified these interpretations with additional experience. Children heard four novel verbs in conjunction with videotaped events of a person performing an action to achieve a result. Verb meaning interpretations were assessed froth response patterns across generalization tests, where children indicated {{whether or not the}} verbs could be applied to new events where the action, result, or action and result were changed. The majority of response patterns were consistent with one of five meaning categories, suggesting that children adopt hypotheses about the meanings of novel verbs. When the verbs were heard in a single training context, 3 -year-olds <b>showed</b> <b>preferences</b> for conservative and action-and-result interpretations and 5 -year-olds <b>showed</b> <b>preferences</b> for result and action-and-result interpretations. Conservative interpretations were indicated when children failed to extend the verbs to any event that was different from the training events. When the novel verbs were heard in multiple contexts where the actions (or results) systematically varied while the result (or action) remained constant, children 2 ̆ 7 s interpretations tended to be concordant with the training contexts. An age effect was found, where 3 -year-olds made more concordant action interpretations and 5 -year-olds made more concordant result interpretations. These results suggest that the children test hypotheses and adopt hypotheses that are concordant with their experience with the verbs. A hypothesis testing strategy was proposed where children initially adopt narrow interpretations of verb meanings and then move to progressively broader interpretations as they are exposed to the verbs in other contexts. The use of response patterns to index children 2 ̆ 7 s verb meaning interpretations was suggested to be a valid and potentially useful methodology. ...|$|E
