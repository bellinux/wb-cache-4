25|$|If the English batsmen had {{struggled}} the Australians completely floundered. Jack Moroney, Arthur Morris and Sam Loxton were out for ducks and Australia were 0/3 {{in a matter}} of minutes as Trevor Bailey took his new best Test figures of 4/22 and Alec Bedser 3/9. This was the worst start to a Test innings until Alec Bedser and Fred Trueman reduced India to 0/4 at Headingley in 1952. Neil Harvey top-scored with 12, but the only runs came from the edge of the bat and after an hour Hassett gave up and declared on 32/7, leaving England 193 to win. This was a gamble as although there was <b>still</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> take quick wickets the pitch might recover the next day.|$|E

2500|$|For {{most of his}} career, de Klerk had a very {{conservative}} reputation. [...] The NP's Transvaal branch was historically the most staunchly conservative wing of the party, and he supported continued segregation of universities while Minister of National Education. It thus {{came as a surprise}} when in 1989 he placed himself at the head of verligte ("enlightened") forces within the governing party which had come to believe that apartheid could not be maintained forever. [...] This wing favoured beginning negotiations while there was <b>still</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get reasonable terms.|$|E
2500|$|While male {{prisoners were}} {{often used in}} single studies, so {{that the results of}} the {{experimentation}} on them would not be clouded by other variables, women were sometimes used in bacteriological or physiological experiments, sex experiments, and as the victims of sex crimes. The testimony of a unit member that served as guard graphically demonstrated this reality:"One of the former researchers I located told me that one day he had a human experiment scheduled, but there was <b>still</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> kill. So he and another unit member took the keys to the cells and opened one that housed a Chinese woman. One of the unit members raped her; the other member took the keys and opened another cell. There was a Chinese woman in there who had been used in a frostbite experiment. She had several fingers missing and her bones were black, with gangrene set in. He was about to rape her anyway, then he saw that her sex organ was festering, with pus oozing to the surface. He gave up the idea, left and locked the door, then later went on to his experimental work." ...|$|E
2500|$|I had {{a terrific}} {{friendship}} with Sheila Florance. In fact she acted in {{my very first}} film, and we always used to joke that I would make her a star. When I heard suddenly that she was dying of cancer I visited her immediately. There was no sentimentality or anything on her part—she was an incredible woman—but she said jokingly, 'There is <b>still</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> turn me into a star, but let's be quick.' I went home and spent three days and three nights writing the script and then with Barry Dickins and Sheila we did another draft. She was given eight weeks to live and so we made A Woman's Tale with this hanging over us. This motivated us, of course, but Sheila had a degree of greatness about her. She was a very powerful woman. It was an amazing challenge {{to make a film}} about life, in the face of death. To get the money of course was impossible and I had to pawn everything I had. People have asked me how we did it but to some extent we were idiotically courageous in taking this risk. Sheila and I joked all the time. I would say to Sheila, [...] "Please don't die on me or you'll kill me". She would reply, [...] "Don't worry I'll be a good girl." ...|$|E
