40|$|One of the {{important}} issues in parallel program debugging is an efficient detection of access anomalies caused by uncoordinated access to shared variables. On-the-fly detection of access anomalies has the major advantage that it reports only actual anomalies during execution while <b>static</b> analysis <b>methods</b> <b>report</b> all the potential anomalies, many of which cannot actually materialize during execution. It also has the advantage that shorter traces are produced for post-mortem analysis purposes if an anomaly is detected. The {{reason for this is}} that after an anomaly occurs, further trace information is of dubious value because the first anomaly may have affected subsequent program behavior. So, once the first anomaly occurs, no further trace information need be generated. Existing methods for on-the-fly access anomaly detection suffer from performance penalties since the execution of the program being debugged has to be interrupted on every access to shared variables. In this paper, we propo [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{format of}} {{information}} {{can provide a}} powerful communication tool; however, a confluence of mismatched formats can be problematic. Particularly {{in the area of}} home energy audits, service providers rely on <b>static</b> <b>reports</b> that outline potential savings and recommendations to customers. These reports are created using a variety of information formats. In a broader sense, incorporating an understanding of the user, at a cognitive level, can reduce the cognitive effort required to comprehend the information presented. This research explores the potential for enhancing these <b>static</b> <b>reports</b> for usability and comprehension. In the paper, a summary of reviews on cognitive theory, comprehension, and style is presented. The hypothesis that matched information format and individual cognitive style will result in more accurate recall and a higher usability rating is tested through a comprehension and usability experiment.

40|$|The goal of {{our study}} was to {{determine}} current melanoma <b>reporting</b> <b>methods</b> available to dermatologists and dermatopathologists and quantify changes in <b>reporting</b> <b>methods</b> from 2012 to 2014. A cross-sectional study design was utilized consisting of website perusal of reporting procedures, followed up by telephone and email inquiry of <b>reporting</b> <b>methods</b> from every state cancer registry. This study was conducted over a six-month period from February to August 2014. A previous similar survey was conducted in 2012 over the same time frame and results were compared. Kansas state cancer registry provided no data. As of August 2014, 96 % of 49 state cancer registries had electronic methods available to all designated reporters. Seven (14 %) states required an electronic-only <b>method</b> of <b>reporting</b> melanoma cases. Eighty-six percent allowed hard copy pathology report submission. Compared to the 2012 survey, 2 additional states were found to have initiated electronic <b>reporting</b> <b>methods</b> by 2014. In conclusion, a variety of <b>methods</b> exist for <b>reporting</b> diagnosed melanoma cases. Although most state cancer registries were equipped for electronic transmission of cases for mandated reporters, a number of states were ill-equipped for electronic submission from outpatient dermatologists.

Results: A group of 63 experts from 14 countries participated. Consensus was reached on a statement recommending that the continuous patient-reported outcomes commonly used in back pain trials, are reported using between-group mean differences (accompanied by minimally important difference (between-group/population-level) thresholds where these exist), the proportion of participants improving and deteriorating according to established and relevant minimally important change thresholds, and the number needed to treat; all with 95...|$|R
