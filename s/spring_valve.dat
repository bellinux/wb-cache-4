50|$|The first {{submarine}} decoys {{were the}} German Bold fitted to U-boats of World War II. These were a pellet of calcium hydride {{in a simple}} metal container. On contact with sea water, the calcium hydride decomposed to produce a trail of hydrogen gas bubbles that acted as a bubble curtain and reflected ASDIC impulses to produce a false target. The container trapped hydrogen and floated, with a crude <b>spring</b> <b>valve</b> to maintain buoyancy to keep it at a constant depth.|$|E
50|$|His {{model for}} how certain {{behavioural}} reactions are provoked {{was based on}} work by Konrad Lorenz. Lorenz postulated that for each instinctive act there is a specific energy which builds up in a reservoir in the brain. In this model, Lorenz envisioned a reservoir with a <b>spring</b> <b>valve</b> at its base that an appropriate stimulus could act on, much like a weight on a scale pan pulling against a spring and releasing the reservoir of energy, an action which would lead an animal to express the desired behaviour.|$|E
5000|$|Sear Trip: Even with an {{electronic}} trigger, the Autococker still relies on a hammer and <b>spring</b> <b>valve</b> for firing. The electronic trigger controls the recocking pneumatics, and a sear solenoid. Thus, even electronic Autocockers have an amount of recoil and rate of fire some find unacceptable for serious play (though Autocockers are still seen in serious tournament play). In early 2006, the first fully electronic (valve and recock) electronic Autocockers were seen, made using the [...] "mQ valve" [...] (named after their inventor Mike Quinn). The valve only had a limited release cycle however, and became tied up in production and legal issues. A lack of steady supply of mQ valves caused prices to skyrocket on eBay, even for used or damaged ones. In mid-2007, the original creators announced that they had resolved the production issues and are now making new [...] "mQ2 valves," [...] which are mQ valves redesigned for greater reliability, flow, and consistency.|$|E

There are two <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> per <b>valve</b> {{and four}} valves per cylinder. While a dual <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> configuration is used, the stock springs are fairly low-sprung. Low spring rates {{were chosen for}} increased valvetrain longevity and low friction with the dual <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> for the reduction of harmonics and increased valve stability.|$|R

The proposed analytical tool obtains a key design characteristic of a valve, which is the flow rate and the corresponding maximum stress level in the stack of plates, {{as a function of}} a pressure load. The tool is prepared based on the cases produced by a first-principle model using a finite element approach. The finite element model was calibrated based on experimental results to provide accurate results in the entire range of input parameters...|$|E

In this study, a novel notion of general frequency is proposed and some simulation signals are used to compare its performances with the traditional frequency and the instantaneous frequency. Based on the notion, an adaptive peak decomposition approach is investigated and applied to the fault diagnosis of vibration signal for reciprocating compressor gas valve in four states including normal valve state, gap valve state, fractured valve state and bad <b>spring</b> <b>valve</b> state. The results show the effectiveness and {{the superiority of the}} proposed approach in extracting the fault feature of reciprocating compressor...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} spring valves with the ultimate aim of using them as high pressure hydraulic flow-control valves for agri­cultural applications. A closed helical coil spring, when pressurized, will provide a controlled flow between the coils when extended or later­ally deflected a given distance. Tests revealed severe longitudinal oscillations when operating in the extension mode, resulting in a very low fatigue life. The lateral deflection mode did not exhibit these oscillations but did exhibit a surge phenomenon at higher pressures. A four-way closed center <b>spring</b> <b>valve</b> was built using four exter­nally pressurized springs operating in the lateral deflection mode. A unique cable actuation system provided good proportional control with minimum deadzone and tolerancing. Tests showed that performance was acceptable up to approximately 1, 000 psi but surges at higher pressures deteriorated performance. As {{a result of this}} study it is concluded that spring valves have applications at moderate pressures but operation at higher pressures is not practical...|$|E

50|$|Poppet valves {{typically}} require small coil <b>springs,</b> appropriately named <b>valve</b> <b>springs,</b> to {{keep them}} closed when not actuated by the camshaft. They {{are attached to the}} valve stem ends, seating within spring retainers. Other mechanisms can be used in place of <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> to keep the valves closed: Formula 1 engines employ pneumatic <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> in which pneumatic pressure closes the valves, while motorcycle manufacturer Ducati uses desmodromic valve drive which mechanically close the valves.|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 221 Compared to {{leading edge}} {{technologies}} such as high speed turbomachinery, reciprocating pumps {{may appear to be}} a simple technology: A reciprocating plunger causes liquid to be drawn from a low pressure manifold through the suction check valves, and expelled into a high pressure manifold through the discharge check valves. However, the interaction of flow, valve dynamics, and the acoustics of the pump and piping system can generate high amplitude pressure pulsation, causing severe vibration and reliability problem in some systems. The effects of improperly operating valves, and the successful resolution of such problems with valve design modifications are examined. Since the pump vales are operated by the action of the fluid, valve components (including the <b>spring,</b> <b>valve</b> body, valve disc shape, and sealing surfaces, etc.) must be carefully selected to ensure that the valves open and close at the appropriate times. Problems associated with valve dynamics include over pressure spikes at the opening of discharge valves, under pressure spikes {{at the opening of the}} suction valves, high noise levels, and excessive wear of valve components. Severe over pressure spikes have been known to cause fatigue failures of pump working barrels, connecting rods, bearings, and even drive-train components. Under pressure spikes can cause cavitation that can also lead to plunger and valve failures, due to pitting damage. High level valve noise is usually indicative of sever impacts associated with the opening and closing of the valves. Impacts at the valve closing are sometimes referred to as valve hammer and can result in damage to the sealing surfaces. Impacts at the valve opening, which may be identified by damage to the back side of the valve disc, are due to the over pressure and under pressure spikes which can result in fatigue failures of the components. Excessive valve wear can also be experienced when the valve disc material is not suitable for the pumping conditions. The use of field data coupled with a computer model to analyze the valve dynamics will be presented. Using this tool, the effect of various valve modifications such as changes in sealing surfaces, valve lift, spring preload, and spring stiffness can be observed. Instrumentation and data analysis techniques to evaluate these problems will also be discussed. The effects of modifications to valves (including changes in lift, spring preload, spring construction and stiffness, valve disc geometries, etc.) will be examined using data from actual systems...|$|E

50|$|Shot peening is {{a crucial}} process in spring making. Types of springs include leaf springs, {{extension}} springs, and compression springs. The most widely used application are for engine <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> (compression springs) due to high cyclic fatigue.
