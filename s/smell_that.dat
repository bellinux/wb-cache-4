Since its seeds are not protected by an ovary wall, it can morphologically be considered a gymnosperm. The apricot-like structures produced by female ginkgo trees are technically not fruits, but are seeds that have a shell consisting of a soft and fleshy section (the sarcotesta), and a hard section (the sclerotesta). The sarcotesta has a strong <b>smell</b> <b>that</b> most people find unpleasant.|$|E

30|$|Oizumi et al. {{study was}} not the only one to {{investigate}} inter-related code smells. Abbes et al. [6] brought up the notion of code <b>smells</b> <b>that</b> interact to each in the source code. They also investigated the effects of such interacting. They concluded that classes and methods identified as God Classes and God Methods in isolation did not affect maintenance effort; however, when these two smells appear together, they led to a statistically significant increase in maintenance effort. Yamashita and Moonen [7] also investigate the relationship between code <b>smells.</b> They observed <b>that</b> inter-smell relationships negatively affect the maintenance. Posteriorly, Yamashita et al. [8] studied collocated smells—code <b>smells</b> <b>that</b> interact in the same source code file—and coupled smells—code <b>smells</b> <b>that</b> interact across different source code files. Regarding software design, they observed that limiting the analysis to collocated smells would reduce their capability to reveal design problems, as coupled smells may reveal critical design problems.|$|R

The Palestinians had hidden their weapons in the gas tank of a car parked in Italian in preparation for boarding the ship. Their smuggled weapons still with gasoline residue on them, gave off a <b>smell</b> <b>that</b> the crew had noticed but had not acted on.

[...] He said that they were only allowed out [...] "at certain times of day that would be adjudicated to be the least likely time when DM [...] would run into them if he was on the property. They would march out to Old Gilman House to take a shower and come back because they had no shower facilities inside the Hole. Later that got upgraded to let them go down to the garage." [...] Sometimes executives were allowed out for a short time to attend Church events, but many ended up spending months or even years in the Hole.|$|E

The 3 C model {{states that}} three basic {{activities}} drive the operations for software production: (a) communication with peers to realise organisational activities; (b) coordination {{of activities and}} tasks to achieve planned business goals; (c) cooperation on tasks that require concurrent and shared work/expertise. Intuitively, <b>smells</b> <b>that</b> exist in community members’ interactions hinder communication. Similarly, coordination, or organisation in context [42], is compromised by <b>smells</b> <b>that</b> exist in the communities’ context. Finally, cooperation, is compromised by smells existing in communities’ structure.|$|R

This suggests a framework to structure future research in discovering community smells, but also suggests an intrinsic difficulty to measure social debt in a precise way, depending on non-trivial relations and characteristics with implicit relations.|$|R

500|$|Higgins {{ventured into}} real estate at [...] first, {{and with the}} money that he saved as a logger, he started the Higgins Manufacturing Company to {{manufacture}} bricks. The business sparked his interest in oil and gas, as he used it for his kilns to burn the bricks evenly. He decided to travel to Pennsylvania to learn about these fuels and study the geographical features that give signs {{to the presence of}} underground oil. Studying geology on his own, he dedicated himself to finding these clues by reading all the United States Geological Survey reports and books that he could find. The details he learned reminded him of what some Beaumont locals back home referred to as [...] "Sour Hill Mound", a place where he frequently brought his Sunday school students for outings. This mound was described as [...] "sour" [...] due to the unpleasant sulfur <b>smell</b> <b>that</b> came out of the springs around it. Convinced that this salt dome mound had oil below it, Higgins first partnered with George O'Brien, George Carroll, Emma John, and J.F. Lanier to form the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company in 1892. It was during this time that other formally trained geologists dismissed the idea of finding oil along the gulf coast region of the United States. Higgins' personal integrity was even challenged by the local newspaper. However, his informal training in geology influenced his belief that the Spindletop field contained oil below due to the presence of mineral water and gas seepage, and he managed to convince the partners to proceed with the venture. Work began the following year, but all three of the shallow drilling attempts failed to locate oil due to the shifting sands and unstable clay under the hill. Higgins held onto his ownership and leases of land over the salt dome, but resigned from the company.|$|E

2500|$|For {{control of}} fascioloidosis in wild ruminants, {{successful}} application of anthelminthics in feed is necessary. The drug {{has to have}} flavour and <b>smell</b> <b>that</b> do not prevent animals from eating medicated feed. In addition, there should adequate therapeutic scope, i.e. span between therapeutic and minimal toxic dose. Therefore, only some of anthelminthics that are efficient in domestic ruminants have been tested in wild ruminants infected with F. magna. Several drugs, namely oxyclozanide, rafoxanide, albendazole, diamphenetide, closantel, clorsulon, and triclabendazole, {{have been used in}} control of F. magna infection in cervids. However, the results have differed between different authors. In the same way as for F. hepatica, triclabendazole seems to be the most effective against F. magna. Fascioloidosis of cervids was successfully controlled with triclabendazole in USA, and [...] triclabendazole with levamizole in Hungary, Canada, Austria, and Croatia. In contrast, rafoxanide is commonly used in treatment in Czech Republic [...] Slovakia [...] and Hungary. Nevertheless, recent studies suggested that use of rafoxanide in control of F. magna infection should be considered. Unfortunately, rafoxanide in a commercial drug called Rafendazol Premix is the only registered drug for wild ruminants. Triclabendazole and others are produced as drugs for domestic animals and it can be used in free-living animals only with special permit. In some cases, {{it may be difficult to}} determine if F. magna or a different fluke such as Fasciola hepatica or Fasciola gigantica is causing pathology since all these flukes will have the same clinical signs. In the case that the identity of the trematode cannot be determined, the drug triclabendazole can be used since this will deal with all three parasites.|$|E
2500|$|Following Suesan's death, Theresa Knorr began {{directing}} {{the majority of}} her anger and abuse towards her daughter Sheila. In May 1985, Knorr forced Sheila into prostitution to support the family. Knorr did not work and received money {{from the state of}} California. Knorr was initially pleased with this arrangement due to the large amounts of money Sheila was earning and allowed Sheila to leave the house whenever she pleased. After a few weeks, Knorr became angry and accused Sheila of being pregnant and contracting a sexually transmitted disease which Knorr claimed she caught from Sheila via a toilet seat. Sheila initially denied the accusations. So Knorr beat her, hog tied her and locked her in a hot closet with no ventilation. Knorr forbade her other children to give Sheila food or water or to {{open the door to the}} closet. Terry Knorr disobeyed her mother and gave Sheila a beer. Terry Knorr later said, [...] "She [...] wanted Sheila to confess. That was mother's way. Beat them until they confess." [...] To end the punishment, Sheila confessed to being pregnant and having an STD but Knorr would not let her out of the closet claiming that Sheila was lying. Sheila died three days later, on June 21, 1985, of dehydration and starvation. Knorr left Sheila's body in the closet for an additional three days before discovering that Sheila was dead. Once again, Knorr ordered her sons William and Robert to dispose of Sheila's body which had begun to decompose causing an odorous <b>smell</b> <b>that</b> filled the apartment. The boys placed Sheila's body in a cardboard box which they disposed of near the airport in Truckee, California. [...] Sheila's body was discovered a few hours after it had been disposed of but was never positively identified and was classified as Jane Doe #6607-85.|$|E

Our technique has been implemented in a tool which helps users detecting faults. To validate the proposed technique, we consider a wellknown and well-documented catalog of faulty spreadsheets. Our experiments yield two main results: we were able to distinguish between <b>smells</b> <b>that</b> can point to faulty cells from <b>smells</b> and those <b>that</b> are not capable of doing so; and we provide a technique capable of detecting a significant number of errors: two thirds of the cells labeled as faulty are in fact (documented) errors...|$|R
