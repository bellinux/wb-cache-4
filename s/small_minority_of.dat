Neopaganism in the United Kingdom is primarily represented by Wicca and Witchcraft religions, Druidry, and Heathenry. According to the 2011 UK Census, there are roughly 53,172 people who identify as Pagan in England, and 3,448 in Wales, including 11,026 Wiccans in England and 740 in Wales.|$|E
5|$|The Sogdian {{religious}} texts {{found in}} China and {{dating to the}} Northern Dynasties, Sui, and Tang are mostly Buddhist (translated from Chinese sources), Manichaean and Nestorian Christian, with only a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> Zoroastrian texts. But tombs of Sogdian merchants in China dated to {{the last third of}} the 6th century show predominantly Zoroastrian motifs or Zoroastrian-Manichaean syncretism, while archaeological remains from Sogdiana appear fairly Iranian and conservatively Zoroastrian.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there is}} a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> Gypsies (Ciganos) <b>of</b> about 40,000 people, Muslims about 34,000 people and an even <b>smaller</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> Jews of about 5,000 people (some Ashkenazi, and the {{majority}} Sephardi, such as the Belmonte Jews).|$|R

5|$|The {{majority}} of Muslims {{in the country}} are adherents of a moderate branch of mystical Islam (Sufism). Its most common expression is the Tijaniyah, an order followed by the 35% of Chadian Muslims which incorporates some local African religious elements. A <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> the country's Muslims hold more fundamentalist practices, which, in some cases, may be associated with Saudi-oriented Salafi movements.|$|E
5|$|About 1% of school-age {{children}} and adolescents have Tourette's. It was once considered a rare and bizarre syndrome, most often associated with coprolalia (the utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks), but this symptom is present in only a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> people with Tourette's. The condition was named by Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) {{on behalf of his}} resident, Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette (1857–1904), a French physician and neurologist, who published an account of nine patients with Tourette's in 1885.|$|E
5|$|Belarus {{was once}} a major center of European Jews, with 10% of the {{population}} being Jewish. But since the mid-20th century, the number of Jews has been reduced by the Holocaust, deportation, and emigration, so that today {{it is a very}} <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> less than one percent. The Lipka Tatars, numbering over 15,000, are predominantly Muslims. According to Article 16 of the Constitution, Belarus has no official religion. While the freedom of worship is granted in the same article, religious organizations deemed harmful to the government or social order can be prohibited.|$|E

5|$|Between 1950 and 1988, around 4 million East Germans {{migrated}} to the West; 3.454million left between 1950 {{and the construction of}} the Berlin Wall in 1961. After the border was fortified and the Berlin Wall constructed, the number of illegal crossings fell dramatically and continued to fall as the defences were improved over the subsequent decades. However, escapees were never more than a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> the total number of emigrants from East Germany. During the 1980s, only about 1% of those who left East Germany did so by escaping across the border. Far more people left the country after being granted official permits, by fleeing through third countries or by being ransomed by the West German government.|$|E
5|$|During the Seven Years' War (in America, {{known as}} the French and Indian War), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone {{population}} remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the {{rate of natural increase}} was such that by the 1770s only a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> Americans had been born overseas. The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though most}} ethnic groups prefer to {{communicate}} in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> the country's urban elite, {{and it is not}} spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the 3 main languages spoken in Nigeria itself (Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba) but unlike the Yorubas and Igbos, the Hausas tend not to travel far outside Nigeria itself.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, the Welsh {{roots of}} the college {{come to the fore}} most {{prominently}} on Saint David's Day. The feast is marked by a choral Evensong in the chapel, decorated for the occasion with daffodils. The service, including music, is conducted entirely in Welsh (despite only a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> the choir usually being native speakers of the language). It is generally well attended by members of the Welsh community in Oxford. The college's annual St. David's Day Dinner traditionally culminates with the serving of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn's Pudding. The name recalls the Welsh politician and prominent Jacobite who attended the college early in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Among African slaves, Catholicism was the {{religion}} of the majority. Most slaves came originally from the midwestern and southwestern portions of the African coast. For over four centuries this region had been the subject of Christian mission activities. Some Africans and their descendants, however, held onto elements of polytheistic religious traditions by merging them with Catholicism. This resulted in the creation of syncretic creeds such as Candomblé. Islam was also practiced among a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> African slaves, although it was harshly repressed {{and by the end of}} the 19th century had been completely extinguished. By the beginning of the 19th century, the Indians in most of eastern Brazil had been either assimilated or decimated. Some tribes resisted assimilation and either fled farther west, where they were able to maintain their diverse polytheistic beliefs, or were restricted to aldeamentos (reservations), where they eventually converted to Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their legal}} {{privileges}} over that of merchants, {{the work of}} artisans was considered by Han Confucian scholars to be of secondary importance to that of farmers. This is perhaps largely because scholars and officials could not survive without the farmer's product and taxes paid in grain. The government relied on taxed grain to fund its military campaigns and stored surplus grain to mitigate widespread famine during times of poor harvest. Despite the prominence given to farmers, Confucian scholars did accept that artisans performed a vital economic role. This view was only rejected by a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> Legalists, who advocated a society of only soldiers and farmers, and certain Daoists who wanted everyone to live in self-sufficient villages and without commercial interests.|$|E

5|$|However, {{by then it}} {{had become}} clear that Frogner west of Solli plass would remain dominantly a {{residential}} area. The estimates showed that the station would capture few new riders and instead simply give a shorter walk for a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> those who used Nationaltheatret Station and Skøyen Station. With the upgraded Nationaltheatret Station, which opened in 1999, {{the capacity of the}} Oslo Tunnel increased from 16 to 24 trains per hour in each direction, because the station from then had four, rather than two, tracks. A similar upgrade would need to be done for Elisenberg Station, should it be taken into use, or the capacity of the tunnel would again be reduced. It is therefore highly unlikely that the station will ever be opened. In 1998, the readers of the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten proposed making Elisenberg an emergency exit.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, about {{eighty percent}} of Sri Lankan Tamils were Hindus who {{followed}} the Shaiva sect. The rest were mostly Roman Catholics who converted after the Portuguese conquest of Jaffna Kingdom and coastal Sri Lanka. There is also a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> Protestants due to missionary efforts in the 18th century by organisations such as the American Ceylon Mission. Most Tamils who inhabit the Western Province are Roman Catholics, while those of the Northern and Eastern Provinces are mainly Hindu. Pentecostal and other churches, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, are active among the internally displaced and refugee populations. The 2012 Sri Lanka Census revealed a Buddhist population of 22,254 amongst Sri Lankan Tamils. Accounting to roughly 1% of all Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|A committee, {{headed by}} Thorpe, was {{established}} to recruit employees and headquartered itself at Labor Hall. Throughout September and October, many employees began to join the union, but the Terminal and Traction Company responded by firing employees who joined and refused to recognize the union. After the failure of their initial attempt to have the union recognized by the company, the committee petitioned the United States Department of Labor to mediate discussions {{between them and the}} management of the business. On October 27, 1913, the department offered Ethelbert Stewart, head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to mediate. To begin negotiations, the workers' committee submitted a list of grievances to the company and Stewart. The company, however, refused his services, denied there was a labor problem and said no attempt at unionizing was being made. They insisted that only a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> workers were behind the troubles and alleged that it was outside influences behind the unionizing effort. In a later report, the Department of Labor claimed that had their offer of mediation been accepted, the subsequent strike and riot could have been averted.|$|E

25|$|An even <b>smaller</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> no {{more than}} 2,000 people speak Barranquenho, a dialect of Portuguese heavily {{influenced}} by Extremaduran, spoken in the Portuguese town of Barrancos (in the border between Extremadura and Andalusia, in Spain, and Portugal).|$|R
5|$|Both the Zygalski-sheet {{method and}} each bomba worked {{for only a}} single {{scrambler}} rotor order, so six sets of Zygalski sheets and six bomby were produced. However, the Germans introduced two new rotors on 15 December 1938, giving a choice of three out of five to assemble in the machines on a given day. This {{increased the number of}} possible rotor orders from 6 to 60. The Biuro could then only read the <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> messages that used neither of the two new rotors. They did not have the resources to produce 54 more bomby or 54 sets of Zygalski sheets. Fortunately, however, the fact that the SD network was still using the old method of the same indicator setting for all messages, allowed Rejewski to re-use his previous method of working out the wiring within these rotors. This information was essential for the production of a full set Zygalski sheets which allowed resumption of large-scale decryption in January 1940. On 1 January 1939, the Germans made military Enigma even more difficult to break by increasing the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight, to between seven and ten.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Jacobite armies {{were made}} up of Highlanders, serving in clan regiments. They were 70 per cent of the forces in the 1715 {{rebellion}} and over 90 per cent of those in 1745. Most were forced to join by their clan chiefs, landlords or feudal superiors and desertion was a major problem during campaigns. The Jacobites suffered {{from a lack of}} trained officers. A typical clan regiment was {{made up of}} a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> gentlemen (tacksmen) who would bear the clan name. The clan gentlemen formed the front ranks of the unit and were more heavily armed than their impoverished tenants who made up the bulk of the regiment. Because they served in the front ranks, the gentlemen suffered higher proportional casualties than the common clansman. The Jacobites often started campaigns poorly armed. In the rising of 1745, at the Battle of Prestonpans, some only had swords, Lochaber axes, pitchforks and scythes, but arms tended to become more conventional as the campaigns progressed. Only officers and gentlemen were equipped with a broadsword, targe and pistol. After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, the Hanoverian commander the Duke of Cumberland reported that there were 2,320 firelocks recovered from the battlefield, but only 190 broadswords.|$|E
5|$|While a <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> {{cockroaches}} {{are associated}} with human habitats and viewed as repugnant by many people, a few species are of conservation concern. The Lord Howe Island wood-feeding cockroach (Panesthia lata) is listed as endangered by the New South Wales Scientific Committee, but the cockroach may be extinct on Lord Howe Island itself. The introduction of rats, the spread of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) and fires are possible reasons for their scarcity. Two species are currently listed as endangered and critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, Delosia ornata and Nocticola gerlachi. Both cockroaches have a restricted distribution and are threatened by habitat loss and rising sea levels. Only 600 Delosia ornata adults and 300 nymphs are known to exist, and these are threatened by a hotel development. No action has been taken to save the two cockroach species, but protecting their natural habitats may prevent their extinction. In the former Soviet Union, cockroach populations have been declining at an alarming rate; this may be exaggerated, or the phenomenon may be temporary or cyclic. One species of roach, Simandoa conserfariam is considered extinct in the wild.|$|E
