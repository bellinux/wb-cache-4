25|$|Soils in Columbia {{are well}} drained in most cases, with grayish brown loamy sand topsoil. The subsoil may be {{yellowish}} red <b>sandy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> (Orangeburg series), yellowish brown <b>sandy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> (Norfolk series), or strong brown sandy clay (Marlboro series). All {{belong to the}} Ultisol soil order.|$|E
25|$|The topsoil on {{the grounds}} {{previous}} outfield was a <b>sandy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>loam,</b> which struggled to cope with Bridgetown's occasional heavy rainfall, with climate data indicating that a storm lasting {{up to an hour}} could dump about 50mm of rain once every five years. The topsoil was a complete mixture of soils and significantly varied in depth, lying over ancient coral reef limestone.|$|E
25|$|Houston {{is largely}} {{located within the}} Northern Humid Gulf Coast Prairies level IV {{ecoregion}} (34a), {{a subset of the}} Western Gulf coastal grasslands level III region as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. This region is generally underlaid by Quaternary-aged sand, silts, and clays (clay, clay loam, or <b>sandy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>loam)</b> and covered by grasslands with occasional clusters of oak trees.|$|E
50|$|Calothamnus gibbosus {{occurs in}} the area between the Lort River and the Stirling Range and mostly at least 10 km from the coast in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic region. It grows on <b>sandy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>loams,</b> {{sometimes}} over gravel or laterite.|$|R
50|$|The bedrock under Uplands is {{quartz diorite}} gneiss. Soils are well drained sandy loams of the Cadboro and Langford series (Cd-L or Lsl), or poorly drained <b>sandy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>loams</b> of the Tolmie series (Tscl); all have thick dark topsoils.

40|$|Data from {{a number}} of field and pot trials {{established}} on humic <b>sandy</b> to <b>sandy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>loams</b> (15 - 35 % clay) indicated non-significant responses to applied lime, despite exchangeable aluminium index (EAI) values well above the accepted threshold value of 54 ppm AI. The use ofthe Al:S soil ratio was investigated as a means of modifying lime requirement as the sulphate ion is thought to participate in the complexing of aluminium, and organic matter is known to release considerable amounts ofsulphur by mineralisation. An AI:S ratio of 2 is proposed as the threshold above which a response to lime is likely. Modified lime recommendations for humic and sulphate-rich <b>sandy</b> loam/sandy <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> soils are suggested...|$|R
25|$|The {{central area}} principally {{consists}} of Magallanes loam with streaks of Magallanes clay loam of sandy texture. This {{is recommended for}} diversified farming such as the cultivation of upland rice, corn, sugarcane, vegetables, coconut, coffee, mangoes and other fruit trees. The steep phase should be forested or planted to rootcrops. The eastern side of Cavite consists of Carmona clay loam with streaks of Carmona clay loam steep phase and Carmona <b>sandy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>loam.</b> This type of soil is granular with tuffaceaous material and concretions. It is hard and compact when dry, sticky and plastic when wet. This type of soil is planted to rice with irrigation or sugarcane without irrigation. Fruit trees such as mango, avocado and citrus are also grown {{in this type of}} soil. Guingua fine sandy loam is found along the lower part of Malabon and Alang-ilang River at Noveleta.|$|E
2500|$|Pedologic surveys {{conducted}} by the Bureau of Soils Management of the Philippine Department of Agriculture have identified two major soil series or categories in Quezon. These road categories are the Bago <b>Sandy</b> <b>Clay</b> <b>Loam</b> and the San Juan Clay. The San Juan Clay is extensively distributed covering about 113.94km² or about 60 percent of the municipality. It offers excellent potential for such agricultural land use like onchards, commercial forest, woodland and pasture/ grazing lands. The Bago <b>Sandy</b> <b>Clay</b> <b>Loam</b> on the other hand, covers about [...] or bout 40% of the municipality. This particular type of soil is devoted to lowland rice farming.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{description}} of a San Joaquin soil profile was given in the Soil Manual as follows: [...] "The surface soil reported as a reddish brown, gritty sandy loam about 14inches thick. [...] The subsoil reported as a sticky and very plastic, brownish red <b>sandy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> about 10inches thick resting abruptly on a red or brownish red, indurated hardpan.The oldest official {{description of}} the San Joaquin Valley series, filed with the Soil Conservation Service, was dated January 1941, and revised August 1952. [...] The concept {{was similar to that}} used by the Eleventh Farm Credit District except that the subsoil was described as a sandy clay with an abrupt upper and lower boundary. [...] This was the first official description that approached the modern concept of the San Joaquin series. [...] Subsequent field and laboratory studies have led to further revisions and to the present concept given in the 1996 series description.In 1983, the type location for the San Joaquin soil was relocated to a site north of Lodi, California, in San Joaquin county. [...] At that time, a monolith (a preserved 5 foot profile section) of the San Joaquin soil was prepared for this site and sent to the Netherlands World Soil Museum in Wageningen, the Netherlands. [...] Previously, the San Joaquin soil had been selected by the Soil Conservation Service as one of California's Benchmark Soils. [...] "Benchmark Soils" [...] is a nationwide listing of soil series considered representative of soils in Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA) in the United States.Modern soil survey maps now show the distribution of San Joaquin Soil of California in Fresno, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Placer, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tulare, and Yuba Counties. [...] They are also located in Butte County, by an older soil survey.|$|E

50|$|Black-tailed {{prairie dog}} {{distribution}} {{is not limited}} by soil type, but by indirect effects of soil texture on moisture and vegetation. Colonies occur in many types of soil, including deep, alluvial soils with medium to fine textures, and occasionally gravel. Soil not prone to collapsing or flooding is preferred. Though they do not select specific types of soil to dig burrows, silty loam clay soils are best for tunnel construction. Surface soil textures in colonies near Fort Collins, Colorado, varied from sandy loam to <b>sandy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> in the top 6 in (15 cm), with a <b>sandy</b> <b>clay</b> <b>loam</b> subsoil. In northern latitudes, colonies commonly occur on south aspects due to the dominance of grasses over shrubs and increased solar radiation during winter. Burrows usually occur on slopes more than 10°.|$|E
