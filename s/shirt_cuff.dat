2500|$|The {{first known}} melody {{written for the}} song was sent in by Silas Pratt when the poem was {{published}} in The Congregationalist. By 1900, at least 75 different melodies had been written. A hymn tune composed by Samuel A. Ward was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today. Just as Bates had been inspired to write her poem, Ward, too, was inspired to compose his tune. The tune came to {{him while he was}} on a ferryboat trip from Coney Island back to his home in New York City, after a leisurely summer day in 1882, and he immediately wrote it down. Supposedly, he was so anxious to capture the tune in his head, he asked fellow passenger friend Harry Martin for his <b>shirt</b> <b>cuff</b> to write the tune on. He composed the tune for the old hymn [...] "O Mother Dear, Jerusalem", retitling the work [...] "Materna". Ward's music combined with Bates's poem were first published together in 1910 and titled [...] "America the Beautiful".|$|E

2500|$|In May 1942, when Gen. Wainwright {{decided to}} {{surrender}} at Corregidor, he ordered Bunker {{to lower the}} U.S. flag and burn it to prevent its falling {{into the hands of}} the Japanese forces. Wainwright later recalled, [...] "Promptly at noon this May 6, 1942, I ordered the white flag run up and our firing ceased. It was with the sickest of feelings that I gave the white-flag-raising order to Colonel Paul D. Bunker." [...] Instead of burning the entire flag, Bunker cut off a piece and concealed it under a patch on his shirt. Before he died in the Japanese prison camp, Bunker sent for Colonel Delbert Ausmus, cut the flag remnant into two pieces and gave one of the pieces to Ausmus. He told Colonel Ausmus he did not expect to survive the prison camp and that it was Ausmus' duty to take his piece of the flag to the Secretary of War. Ausmus concealed the remnant in his <b>shirt</b> <b>cuff,</b> and shortly after the war ended, Ausmus delivered it to Secretary Patterson.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to bright colors and patterns, Robert Graham shirts use contrasting patterns and embroidery on inward-facing surfaces such as inside <b>shirt</b> <b>cuffs,</b> under collars, {{and along the}} button line.

In 2005 the company began production of womenswear as well, using {{the same kinds of}} color, contrast, and detail-heavy aesthetics.|$|R
