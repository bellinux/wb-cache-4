25|$|An {{asymmetrical}} cell division occurs in protodermal cells resulting in one large cell that is fated {{to become a}} pavement cell and a smaller cell called a meristemoid that will eventually differentiate into the guard cells that surround a <b>stoma.</b> This meristemoid then divides asymmetrically one to three times before differentiating into a guard mother cell. The guard mother cell then makes one symmetrical division, which forms a pair of guard cells. Cell division is inhibited in some cells so there is always at least one cell between stomata.|$|E
25|$|Fetal and {{neonatal}} bowel obstructions {{are often}} {{caused by an}} intestinal atresia, {{where there is a}} narrowing or absence of a part of the intestine. These atresias are often discovered before birth via an ultrasound, and treated with using laparotomy after birth. If the area affected is small, then the surgeon may be able to remove the damaged portion and join the intestine back together.

25|$|While {{the first}} mention of urinary {{incontinence}} occurs in 1500 BC in the Ebers Papyrus, the first mention of FI {{in a medical}} context is unknown. For many centuries, colonic irrigation was the only treatment available. <b>Stoma</b> creation was described in 1776, FI associated with rectal prolapse in 1873 and anterior sphincter repair in 1875. During the mid 20th Century, several operations were developed for instances where the sphincters were intact but weakened. Muscle transpositions using the gluteus maximus or the gracilis were devised, but did not become used widely until later. End-to-end sphincteroplasty is shown {{to have a high}} failure rate in 1940. In 1971 Parks and McPartlin first describe an overlapping sphincteroplasty procedure. Biofeedback is first introduced in 1974. In 1975, Parks describes post anal repair, a technique to reinforce the pelvic floor and EAS to treat idiopathic cases. Endoanal ultrasound is invented in 1991, which starts to demonstrate the high number of occult sphincter tears following vaginal deliveries. In 1994, the use of an endoanal coil during pelvic MRI shows greater detail of the anal canal than previously. During the last 20 years, dynamic graciliplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, injectable perianal bulking agents and radiofrequency ablation have been devised, mainly due to the relatively poor success rates and high morbidity associated with the earlier procedures.|$|E
500|$|The genus name Calostoma {{is derived}} from the Greek kallos or [...] "beauty", and <b>stoma</b> (στóμα) or [...] "mouth"; similarly, several species are {{referred}} to in the vernacular as [...] "prettymouths". In Korea, it is called Yongi, or [...] "red cheeks".|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{association}} between diverting <b>stomas</b> and symptomatic anastomotic leakage after rectal cancer surgery was studied, {{as well as}} the impact of leakage on local recurrence, distant metastasis, and disease-free, overall and cancer-specific survival. METHODS: Data from the Swedish Rectal Cancer Trial, Dutch TME trial, CAO/ARO/AIO- 94 trial, EORTC 22921 trial and Polish Rectal Cancer Trial were pooled (n = 5187). All eligible patients without distant metastases at the time of low anterior resection were selected (n = 2726); overall survival was studied in patients aged 75 years or less (n = 2480). Multivariable models were used to study the {{association between}} diverting <b>stomas</b> and anastomotic leakage, and between leakage and recurrence or survival. RESULTS: Some 9. 7 per cent of patients were diagnosed with a symptomatic anastomotic leak; diverting <b>stomas</b> were negatively associated with leakage (11. 6 per cent without and 7. 8 per cent with a stoma; P = 0. 002). Anastomotic leakage was negatively associated with overall survival in the multivariable analysis (hazard ratio (HR) 1. 29 (95 per cent confidence interval 1. 02 to 1. 63); P = 0. 034), but not with cancer-specific survival (HR 1. 12 (0. 83 to 1. 52); P = 0. 466). CONCLUSION: Diverting <b>stomas</b> were associated with less symptomatic anastomotic leakage. Oncological outcome was not significantly influenced by leakage, but overall survival was reduced...|$|R

500|$|Dutch {{ichthyologist}} Pieter Bleeker {{described the}} sicklefin weasel shark in 1852. He {{gave it the}} specific epithet microstoma, from the Greek mikros ("small") and <b>stoma</b> ("mouth"), {{and placed it in}} a new genus, Hemigaleus. His account was based on two females from Jakarta, Indonesia, measuring [...] long. This species was once thought to occur off Australia, but that population is now recognised as a distinct species, H. australiensis. Yuanting Chu's 1960 description of Negogaleus brachygnathus from Chinese waters is probably of the same species as H. microstoma. Albert William Herre's 1929 description of Hemigaleus machlani from the Philippines, though lacking in detail, is also consistent with being of this species.|$|E

The genus name Rhina comes from the Greek rhinos ("snout"); the specific epithet ancylostoma is derived from the Greek ankylos ("curved" [...] or [...] "crooked") and <b>stoma</b> ("mouth"). Although Block and Schneider wrote the epithet as ancylostomus and that form appears in some literature, most modern sources regard the correct form to be ancylostoma. Other common names for this species include shark ray, mud skate, shortnose mud skate, bow-mouthed angel fish, and bow-mouthed angel shark.|$|E
500|$|The genus name {{is derived}} from the Greek stego meaning [...] "covered", and <b>stoma</b> meaning [...] "mouth".

The name [...] "leopard shark" [...] is sometimes applied to the spotted adult, but that name usually refers to the houndshark Triakis semifasciata, and is also sometimes used for the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). Due to their different color patterns and body proportions, both juveniles and subadults have historically been described as separate species (Squalus tigrinus and S. longicaudatus respectively).|$|E

500|$|A {{tracheal}} tube is a catheter that is {{inserted into the}} trachea for {{the primary purpose of}} establishing and maintaining a patent (open and unobstructed) airway. Tracheal tubes are frequently used for airway management in the settings of general anesthesia, critical care, mechanical ventilation and emergency medicine. Many different types of {{tracheal tube}}s are available, suited for different specific applications. An endotracheal tube is a specific type of tracheal tube that is nearly always inserted through the mouth (orotracheal) or nose (nasotracheal). It is a breathing conduit designed to be placed into the airway of critically injured, ill or anesthetized patients in order to perform mechanical positive pressure ventilation of the lungs and to prevent the possibility of aspiration or airway obstruction. The endotracheal tube has a fitting designed to be connected to a source of pressurized gas such as oxygen. At the other end is an orifice through which such gases are directed into the lungs and may also include a balloon (referred to as a cuff). The tip of the endotracheal tube is positioned above the carina (before the trachea divides to each lung) and sealed within the trachea so that the lungs can be ventilated equally. A tracheostomy tube is another type of tracheal tube; this [...] curved metal or plastic tube is inserted into a tracheostomy <b>stoma</b> or a cricothyrotomy incision.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Closure of an enterocutaneous fistula and/or <b>stomas</b> in the {{presence}} of large abdominal wall defects is a challenging problem. In the present study, the results of the components separation technique are described. METHODS: All patients with an enterocutaneous fistula and/or <b>stomas</b> in {{the presence}} of large abdominal wall defects (ie, laparostomy of ventral hernia) who underwent a single-stage repair using the components separation technique in the period from January 2000 to July 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients were included. The median operating time was 204 minutes (range 87 - 573). In 18 patients, additionally to the components separation, an absorbable mesh was used. Postoperatively, in 16 patients 22 complications were reported. There were 9 patients with local wound problems. The median postoperative hospital stay was 12 days (range 5 - 74). Seven patients developed a ventral hernia. Four of them were small asymptomatic recurrences. Four out of the 15 patients with an enterocutaneous fistula developed a recurrent fistula. The median follow-up was 20 months (range 3 - 54). CONCLUSION: Closure of enterocutaneous fistula and/or <b>stomas</b> and simultaneous repair of large abdominal wall defects is feasible using the components separation technique but morbidity is considerable.
