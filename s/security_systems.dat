5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Monaco {{consists of}} up to four players who each control different characters while they partake in s and robberies in many different locations. Players can control one of eight characters, each of whom have their own characteristics, such as the Hacker who can put viruses onto <b>security</b> <b>systems,</b> or the Cleaner who can put guards to sleep. The main difference between single-player and multiplayer modes is that in multiplayer, when a player dies they must be revived before the level can be completed.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} been likened to both Tomb Raider and Metal Gear Solid {{due to the}} 3D {{platforming}} and stealth gameplay respectively. Players guide the forest inhabitants through 20 levels, during which they must infiltrate a series of suburban homes in order to steal a variety of items and destroy construction materials. The items needed to lure endangered animals to the forest must be collected from houses and carried back to the forest one at a time. Each level requires several trips to be completed. <b>Security</b> <b>systems</b> must be avoided or deactivated in order to progress through each level. Household members and their pets must also be avoided, distracted or stunned by a thrown object. For example, a phone card {{can be used to}} make a prank call to lure a householder away, catnip can be used to distract cats.|$|E
5|$|The game {{provides}} {{several options}} for players to face challenges. In addition to direct combat, the player can use plasmids to lure enemies into traps or to turn enemies against each other, or employ stealth tactics to avoid detection by hostiles including the <b>security</b> <b>systems</b> and turrets. The player can hack {{into any of}} Rapture's automated systems; the hacking process is done via a mini-game similar to Pipe Mania where the player must connect two points {{on opposite sides of}} a grid with a limited set of piping within a fixed amount of time, with failure to complete in time costing health and potentially sounding alarms. Early in the game, the player is given a research camera; by taking photographs of enemies, the player will cumulatively gain knowledge about the individual foes which translates into attack boosts and other benefits when facing that enemy type in the future.|$|E

5|$|While in Paris, the Doctor and Romana {{sense the}} effects of time distortion.

The pair meet Inspector Duggan, who {{suspects}} the Countess {{to be involved in}} an ongoing art theft scheme with her husband, Count Scarlioni. Duggan joins the Doctor and Romana in investigating the Scarlioni mansion. There, they find equipment used by Dr. Kerensky to experiment in time, the source of the time distortions, as well as six exact copies of the Mona Lisa. The Doctor instructs Romana and Duggan to continue investigating here while he returns to the TARDIS to visit da Vinci, a good friend of his. After the Doctor leaves, the Count returns after successfully stealing the Mona Lisa, and captures Romana and Duggan. Learning that Romana is familiar with time, he kills Dr. Kerensky and forces Romana to continue the tests.|$|E
5|$|Monaco is a stealth action {{game played}} in a {{top-down}} perspective. The game features both single-player and multiplayer modes and allows up to four players to each control one of eight characters while they partake in heists and robberies in locations including nightclubs, mansions and yachts. Each character has different traits and advantages. The eight characters consist of: the Locksmith, the Cleaner, the Lookout, the Pickpocket, the Mole, the Gentleman, the Redhead, and the Hacker. The Locksmith can open doors {{twice as fast as}} the other characters; the Cleaner can put guards to sleep; the Lookout is able to see enemies who are not in the player's direct line of sight; the Pickpocket owns a monkey which runs around collecting coins; the Mole can dig holes through walls and takes less time to open vents; the Gentleman has the ability to temporarily change his appearance, making the player less detectable to enemies; the Redhead can charm enemies into not attacking them and make characters follow them; and the Hacker has the ability to upload computer viruses to <b>security</b> <b>systems,</b> resulting in them shutting off temporarily. The first four of the eight characters are available immediately.|$|E
5|$|On March 18, 2015, Chabad Lubavitch {{purchased}} a building previously {{owned by the}} Ossining Heights United Methodist Church, on Campwoods Road {{in the village of}} Ossining. Chabad Lubavitch plans to renovate the building significantly before making it its first permanent synagogue. In June 2015, Saint Mary's Episcopal Church announced its plan to close on July 5, after 175 years in operation. A new community center was in development since as late as 2013. The part of the Briarcliff Manor Public Library building that formerly housed the library was renovated to serve as the community center, with a completion date of 2016 and cost of $1,800,000. On December 12, 2015, the Law Park pavilion was damaged in a large fire described as arson; around 100 firefighters in multiple departments assisted to put out the fire that night. Damage to the structure was almost entirely confined to its upper level. The village government hired RGR Landscape to restore and improve the structure, reopening it on Memorial Day in 2017. Insurance covered the reconstruction, which retained the building's architectural style, and included a new concession area, an upper terrace with 280 donor-engraved bricks, bathrooms and walkways for ADA compliance, new lighting, and fire suppression and <b>security</b> <b>systems.</b> The village also planted new trees and shrubs replacing fire-damaged foliage.|$|E

For that reason, an effective house <b>security</b> <b>system</b> at low cost is built where user can also program the <b>security</b> <b>system</b> by their own. This project is focusing on developing a house <b>security</b> <b>system</b> with an active infrared motion detector which is controlled by microcontroller Intel 8051. The overall project {{is divided into two}} parts. The first part is concern on the hardware development where all electronics component are connected via the circuit design using wrapping technique. An active infrared, the magnetic sensor, and keypad are the input components while buzzer, indicator, and LCD display are the output components where it’s all controlled by controller circuit. The second part is base on software programming to operate the hardware structure. Program for <b>security</b> <b>system</b> based on microcontroller Intel 8051 assembly languageis assemble using ASM 51 assembler to get the binary file thus, to load into external memory of the hardware structure via serial communication. The process of downloading and executing the program is done using HyperTerminal’s communication software to the microcontroller serial port. In order to achieve the best house <b>security</b> <b>system,</b> more detectors or sensors can be connected to the microcontroller output port where it can be reprogram by user using their personal computer at home. As the result, the infrared motion detector is capable to detect motion while the microcontroller is capable to control the whole operation of the <b>security</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor's thesis called "Social Security and Social Services in the Past and Present" {{focuses on}} the {{historical}} development as well as current state of social <b>security</b> <b>system</b> and social services. The social <b>security</b> <b>system</b> in the Czech Republic comprises of social insurance, state social support and social assistance. As a whole, the social <b>security</b> <b>system</b> serves as a protection and support for people in difficult life situations. The aim {{of the system is}} to eliminate or at least mitigate the consequences of such unfortunate life situations. The system achieves this mostly by providing various benefits and social services that are discussed separately in this thesis. Social services can be divided into social counselling, social care services and preventive social care services. The goal of this thesis was to describe the current social <b>security</b> <b>system</b> and social services in the Czech Republic and the historical evolution of the system. Next, the thesis also intended to analyse / evaluate the social <b>security</b> <b>system</b> in the historical context. The theoretical part explains the concepts of social security and social services, defines their purpose and describes the current system in the Czech Republic. The practical part concentrates on the history and development of Czech social <b>security</b> <b>system</b> and social services. In the practical part, I analysed the historical development of the social <b>security</b> <b>system</b> and social services in the Czech lands.
