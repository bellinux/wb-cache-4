5|$|Following the family's move to England, Armstrong's father's {{eyesight}} failed further due to retinitis pigmentosa. By that time, {{there were}} ten {{children in the}} Armstrong family. After his younger sister, Louise, died from <b>sudden</b> <b>infant</b> <b>death</b> <b>syndrome,</b> his mother left the family to live with another woman. Armstrong subsequently {{spent much of his}} youth in various children's homes, and was a serial truant from school. His mother had taught him to shoplift as a child, and he was involved in petty crime throughout his youth in Manchester. At nine years old, he began training at Brian Hughes' Collyhurst and Moston Boys' Club. He also played football for a local North Manchester team until the club received so many fines for Armstrong's fighting on the pitch that they were unable to pay them. At this point, he stopped playing football to concentrate on his training in the ring. During his time in the children's home Armstrong met Alison, who has remained his companion (and later his wife) throughout his professional career; they were parents by the time Armstrong was 17.|$|E

40|$|Neonatal {{abstinence}} syndrome (NAS) {{refers to the}} constellation of signs and symptoms exhibited by a newborn of drug-abusing mother. NAS is multisystemic disorder, most frequently involving central nervous and gastrointestinal systems with irritability, high-pitched cry, hyperactive reflexes, increased muscle tone, tremors, generalized convulsions, feeding and sleeping disorders, tachycardia, tachypnea, apnea, termolability and sweating, frequent hiccups, yawning and sneezing, vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration. Intrauterine narcotic disposition can give some other adverse effects beside NAS: fetal distress, premature birth, intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly, increased incidence of congenital anomalies (cardiac and genitourinary anomalies, cleft palate, biliar atresia). Significantly increased risks of <b>sudden</b> <b>infant’s</b> <b>death</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SIDS), abnormalities in neurocognitive and behavioral development and deficiency in motor functions have also been noticed after the long-term surveys of these children.

40|$|The Locus coeruleus (LC) is a dorsal pontine region, {{situated}} bilaterally on {{the floor}} of the fourth ventricle. It is considered to be the major source of noradrenergic innervation in the brain. These neurons are highly sensitive to CO 2 / pH, and chemical lesions of LC neurons largely attenuate the hypercapnic ventilatory response in unanesthetized adult rats. Developmental dysfunctions in these neurons are linked to pathological conditions such as Rett and <b>sudden</b> <b>infant</b> <b>death</b> <b>syndromes,</b> which can impair the control of the cardio-respiratory system. LC is densely innervated by fibers that contain glutamate, serotonin and ATP, and these neurotransmitters strongly affect LC activity, including central chemoreflexes. Aside from neurochemical modulation, LC neurons are also strongly electrically coupled, specifically through gap junctions, which play a role in the CO 2 ventilatory response. This article reviews the available data on the role of chemical and electrical neuromodulation of the LC in the control of ventilation...|$|R

40|$|Background: The <b>sudden</b> <b>infant's</b> <b>death</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SD) is {{the leading}} cause of death in {{children}} under one year. Despite advances in its study, the pathogenesis has not been yet fully elucidated. Aim: To assess the prevalence of SD in Chilean infants and its changes in recent years. Material and Methods: Review of birth and death databases of the Ministry of Health from 1997 to 2009. All cases diagnosed as SD, according to the lnternational Classification of Diseases, 10 th edition, were selected. A demographic analysis was performed and mortality rates for each year were calculated. Results: We identified 1442 cases of SD (847 males, 517 deaths at home). The median age of death was 2 months (0 to 11. 0 months). Ninety six percent of deaths occurred in children aged < 6 months. Mortality rate for SD was 0. 45 / 1000 live births. There was a 23 % reduction between 1997 and 2009. When analyzing geographic distribution, more cases were found in the Southern latitudes of the country. Conclusions: The overall rate of SD in Chile is higher than in European countries and in North America. The observed decrease in cases over the years is still far from optimal...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sudden</b> <b>infant</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SIDS), the <b>sudden</b> and {{unexpected}} {{death of a}} normal and healthy infant, has remained a medical and forensic mystery. Despite years of research all attempts to ascertain the exact cause and manner of death have failed. The information collected {{during the course of}} the comprehensive investigation by the various investigation agencies and analysis of the data has not been in vain. The epidemiological, demographic, and pathological data have identified distinctive features and risk factors associated with infants that died from SIDS. Epidemiological data has provided the unique characteristics of infants that died of SIDS that differentiates them from non-SIDS infants. Analysis of information from the death scene investigation has identified key risk factor behaviour associated with SIDS, namely the prone sleeping position. Pathological examination of the internal organs, specifically the brain, has shown some differences between SIDS and non-SIDS infants. However, to gain a complete picture of SIDS data, all countries around the world must provide information, even basic information, to understand this syndrome better. Developing countries must understand their role and importance in developing plans to investigate, collect, and disseminate SIDS data to the rest of the world.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the family grief and recovery process through a qualitative phenomenological family therapy approach. The study included stories of 22 families and one focus group. Of the losses 14, were perinatal, 6 <b>Sudden</b> <b>Infant</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Syndromes</b> (SIDS) and 2 neonatal deaths. The analysed text was divided into 21 categories, which represent different aspects of the meaning systems of the families. All the families had traumatic symptoms in the beginning, and some mothers suffered from persistent posttraumatic symptoms for several months. Children processed their experiences in grief play and tried to restore their parents back into their roles. Grief was shared in extended families, especially religious families, where acute grief soon generated new meanings. The recovery process starts immediately after the loss, manifesting as thoughts of coping. Grief, trauma and recovery appear intertwined in the stories. Family grief is a many-faceted physical, psychological, spiritual and social process. It is paradoxical, and restorying and retelling are therefore important as a healing process. The main finding of this study is the intensive way the parents initially need to reprocess their attachment to the psychological remains of their baby in order to recover. Grieving thus involves deep attachment rather than detachment, Some families have phantom babies who continue to live psychologically and almost physically or little angels who comfort and escort the family. The parents have invested so much primeval energy in the baby who is no longer alive that they tend to re-create her/him in their minds psychologically or spiritually. Professional helpers still have too little knowledge of crisis intervention. The loss of a baby is an exceptional type of normal grief and the parents therefore have difficulties in getting the support they need. Family debriefing and follow-up are necessary...|$|R
40|$|Physiological {{studies that}} have been {{undertaken}} in children with apparent life-threatening events point to disturbances of the autonomic nervous system and brain stem abnormalities. These abnormalities are manifested as breathing dysfunctions and sleeping patterns, as well as heart rate variability.

This inference well explains well the success of campaigns for supine sleeping position, which associated with the decrease in the rate of <b>sudden</b> <b>infant</b> <b>syndrome</b> <b>deaths...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceSerotonin (5 -HT) is a neuromodulator-transmitter {{influencing}} global brain function.

40|$|BACKGROUND—It {{has been}} speculated that {{non-specific}} defence mechanisms of the epithelium and subepithelial seromucous glands {{play a role in}} the larynx and lungs in cases of <b>sudden</b> <b>infant</b> <b>death.</b>  METHODS—The larynx and trachea from five children who had died of <b>sudden</b> <b>infant</b> <b>death</b> (SID) <b>syndrome</b> and five control cases of comparable age were compared for the presence of lectin binding sites (12 different lectins tested).  RESULTS—The secretory product of mucin producing cells contained carbohydrates including galactose and sialic acids. Binding sites for fucose and N-acetyl-galactosamine were only present in some of the specimens and distribution revealed no correlation between cases of SID and controls. Epithelial cells and serous cells of seromucous glands contained binding sites for sialic acid in cases of SID and controls. Moreover, binding sites for mannose were detected in these cells but were only present in SID cases. The difference between the SID and control groups as to the presence/expression of concanavalin A was highly significant.  CONCLUSIONS—It is suggested that mucus hypersecretion in SID occurs in response to bacterial toxins or viral infection and is not specific. The different binding sites for mannose in cases of SID and controls could indicate differences in the production of antimicrobial peptides. A disturbed expression pattern of antimicrobial peptides in children who later succumb to SID could be responsible for an imbalance of the local microflora with a higher density of microorganisms on the mucosa. Further studies are required to elucidate the pattern of expression of antimicrobial peptides in subsequent SID victims. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Infant</b> <b>Sudden</b> Sleeping <b>infant</b> <b>death</b> Position <b>syndrome</b> — Continued (SIDS) is {{the leading}} cause of postneonatal {{mortality}} in the United States (1). In 1992, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended that all healthy babies be put to sleep either on their back or side to reduce the risk for SIDS (2). In 1994, a national “Back to Sleep ” education campaign was initiated to encourage the public and health-care providers to put babies to sleep on their back or side (3). In November 1996, the AAP modified its policy to preferentially recommend putting infants on their back because of the lower risk for SIDS associated with this position relative to the side position (4). To assess adherence to recommendations for infant sleeping position, CDC analyzed population-based data on the usual infant sleeping position for 1996 births by race from 10 states participating in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis and indicates that infant sleeping position varied by state and race.
