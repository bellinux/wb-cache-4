40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the various visions of the streets {{reflected}} in a few short stories by Chat Kopchitti, Atsiri Thammachot, Wanit Charungkit-anan and Sila Khomchai (who all won the SEA Write Award). After a brief review of the history and situation of the short story in Thailand and a presentation of the corpus and writers, five themes will be developed in relation with five key elements structuring these short stories : the scenery - <b>streets</b> <b>as</b> a place of contrasts -; the characters - <b>streets</b> <b>as</b> a meeting place -; the action - <b>streets</b> <b>as</b> a place of movement -; the themes - <b>streets</b> <b>as</b> an embodiement of social inequalities - and, last, the atmosphere - <b>streets</b> <b>as</b> a nostalgia set. These themes, which constitute major topics in the corpus considered, offer an opportunity to analyse how the city and the streets in the city are perceived by different authors, giving an idea of how Thai intellectuals judge the city and modern urban society.
