Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including physics (especially biomechanics), chemistry, biology, and the earth sciences (of which paleontology is a sub-discipline). Two topics of particular interest and <b>study</b> <b>have</b> been dinosaur size and behavior.|$|E

The degree of inertia {{in the included studies}} varied between 0.07 and 0.145  kg m 2. The rest times between sets varied between 1 and 5  min (1 <b>study</b> <b>had</b> 1  min, 1 <b>study</b> <b>had</b> 1.5  min, 11 <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> 2  min, 5 <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> 3  min, and 2 <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> 5  min).

25|$|Many players {{report that}} the {{emotions}} they feel while playing an MMORPG are very strong, {{to the extent that}} 8.7% of male and 23.2% of female players in a statistical <b>study</b> <b>have</b> had an online wedding.

25|$|While the {{majority}} of exposures {{have been shown to}} come through the diet, accidental ingestion can also be considered a source of exposure. One study conducted in Japan tested plastic baby books to look for possible leaching into saliva when babies chew on them. While the results of this <b>study</b> <b>have</b> yet to be replicated, it gives reason to question whether exposure can also occur in infants through ingestion by chewing on certain books or toys.|$|E
25|$|Post-1997 studies {{indicate}} that around 64% of American adults are overweight, such that if the 56%/40% female/male dissatisfaction rates in the Psychology Today <b>study</b> <b>have</b> held steady since its release, those dissatisfaction rates are if anything disproportionately low: although some individuals continue to believe themselves to be overweight when they are not, those persons are now outnumbered by persons who {{might be expected to}} be dissatisfied with their body but are not.|$|E
25|$|Community {{volunteer}} work {{has proven to}} be a powerful predictor in students' academic lives and college experience as a whole. Studies have shown that students who participate in community service as a part of their college course of <b>study</b> <b>have</b> a much higher correlation of completing their degree (Astin, 1992; Pascarella and Terenzini, 1991). In addition, college students who participate in community volunteer projects as a part of their college experience report finding a much greater relevance in their academic studies after completing community volunteer projects.|$|E

25|$|Another {{consequence}} of increased enrollment {{has been a}} more unbalanced composition of the residences. Traditionally, students from all years of <b>study</b> <b>have</b> lived in residence, but increasingly, very few upper year students continue to live on campus, thus making way for more first years. In 2006, Alexandra Hall, traditionally the all-women's residence, was made co-ed {{for the first time}} with rooms in the basement alternating between male and female occupants as well as one wing of the first floor becoming all-male. In addition, two of the five bays were re-converted to co-ed living spaces in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The current {{literature}} on sex differences produced inconsistent results {{depending on the}} type of testing used. Among the researchers who conducted studies on intelligence, many point that there are no sex differences in g (Jensen 1998, Colom, Garcia, Juan-Esponiza & Abad 2000, Colom, Garcia, Juan-Esponiza & Abad 2002, Camarata and Woodcock 2006), some found a difference favoring males (Lynn 1999, Lynn Irwing 2004, 2008) and some found a difference favoring females (Keith, Reynolds, Patel & Ridley 2006 and Reynolds, Keith, Ridley, Patel 2006). The issues remains unresolved if one uses standardized tests as Jensen (1998) and Colom, Garcia (2002) agrees that there might be a small insignificant sex difference in intelligence in general (IQ) but this may not necessarily reflect a sex difference in general intelligence (g factor). The difference between the two concepts is that IQ is a psychometric scoring system measured with standardized testing, while g factor is a latent scientific construct that correlates with all cognitive tests and achievements in life. Although most researchers distinguish between g and IQ, those that argue for greater male intelligence assert that IQ and g are synonymous (Lynn & Irwing 2004) and so the real division comes from defining IQ in relation to g factor. However, in 2008 Lynn and Irwing proposed that since working memory ability correlate highest with g factor, researchers would have no choice but to accept greater male intelligence if differences on working memory tasks are found. As a result, a neuroimaging study published by Schmidt (2009) conducted an investigation into this proposal by measuring sex differences on an n-back working memory task. The results found no sex difference in working memory capacity and thus contradicting the position pushed forward by Lynn and Irwing (2008) and more in line with those arguing for no sex differences in intelligence. The same results in the 2009 n-back working memory <b>study</b> <b>have</b> also been replicated in numerous other studies since.|$|E
