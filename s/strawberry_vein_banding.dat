50|$|<b>Strawberry</b> <b>vein</b> <b>banding</b> virus (SVBV) {{was first}} {{described}} by Frazier (1955) after differential aphid transmission to susceptible wild strawberries. He described disease symptomatology, identified wild strawberry plants as suitable virus indicators, and demonstrated virus transmission by various aphids, dodder (Cuscuta subinclusa), and grafting. Virus-vector interactions (i.e., specificity of aphid species, acquisition access and retention times, semi-persistent manner of transmission, and transmission efficiency), {{and the inability}} to transmit the virus via sap were established by Frazier (1955). Similar studies focusing on aphid vectors of SVBV and symptomatology were {{used as the basis}} for naming the virus (Prentice, 1952; Schöniger, 1958; Frazier and Posnette, 1958; Frazier, 1960; Mellor and Forbes, 1960; Miller and Frazier, 1970; Frazier and Converse, 1980).|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesPulmonary vein {{stenosis}} (PVS) is {{a relentless}} disease with a poor prognosis. Although surgical repair can effectively treat “downstream” (near left atrial junction) PVS, residual “upstream” (deep in lung parenchyma) PVS commonly dictates long-term survival. Our initial studies revealed {{an association between}} PVS and transforming growth factor-β signaling, which led us to investigate the effect of losartan on upstream pulmonary vein vasculopathy in a piglet model of PVS. MethodsNeonatal Yorkshire piglets underwent sham surgical banding (sham, n =  6), staged bilateral pulmonary <b>vein</b> <b>banding</b> of all pulmonary veins except the right middle pulmonary <b>vein</b> (<b>banded,</b> n =  6), and staged pulmonary <b>vein</b> <b>banding</b> with losartan treatment (losartan, 1 mg/kg/d, n =  7). After 7 weeks, the hemodynamic data were obtained and the piglets killed. ResultsPulmonary <b>vein</b> <b>banding</b> (compared with sham) was associated with continuous turbulent flow in <b>banded</b> pulmonary <b>veins,</b> pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery/systemic blood pressure ratio 0. 51 ± 0. 06 vs 0. 23 ± 0. 02, P < . 001), and diffuse pulmonary vein intimal hyperplasia in the upstream pulmonary veins (P < . 001). Losartan administration decreased the pulmonary artery/systemic blood pressure ratios compared {{with those in the}} banded piglets (0. 36 ± 0. 08 vs 0. 51 ± 0. 06, P = . 007) but it remained greater than those in the sham group (P = . 001). Losartan was also associated with diminished pulmonary vein intimal hyperplasia compared with that in the banded piglets (P < . 001) but still remained more than that in the sham group (P = . 035). Pulmonary <b>vein</b> <b>banding</b> reduced vascular endothelial-cadherin expression, indicative of diminished endothelial integrity, which was restored with losartan. ConclusionsLosartan treatment improved PVS-associated pulmonary hypertension and intimal hyperplasia and might be a beneficial prophylactic therapy for patients at high risk of developing PVS after pulmonary vein surgery...|$|R

40|$|Infectivity of the cloned DNA genome of <b>strawberry</b> <b>vein</b> <b>banding</b> virus (SVBV) was {{demonstrated}} by particle bombardment of 4 -week-old strawberry (Fragaria vesca L. var. UC- 5) plants with gold particles coated with the putative full-length 7 ? 9 kb viral DNA. Vein banding symptoms developed on 15 % of inoculated plants 6 – 7 weeks post-inoculation. An approximate 1 ? 25 -mer of the viral DNA was cloned into the binary vector pCGN 1547. Particle bombardment of this construct into strawberry plants gave an infection rate of 75 %. The construct {{was used for}} transformation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and infiltration of these cells into healthy strawberry leaves resulted in development of vein banding symptoms in 100 % of inoculated plants.

40|$|The {{principal}} aphid-borne viruses infecting Strawberry (Fragaria spp.) Strawberry crinkle virus (SCV), Strawberry mild yellow edge virus (SMYEV), Strawberry mottle virus (SMoV) and <b>Strawberry</b> <b>vein</b> <b>banding</b> virus (SVBV) {{can cause}} serious crop losses. In this paper, a multiplex reverse transcriptase {{polymerase chain reaction}} (RT-PCR) method is described for the simultaneous detection of all four viruses in combination with a plant mRNA specific internal control {{which can be used}} as an indicator of the effectiveness of the extraction and RT-PCR. In total, 18 strawberry isolates infected naturally were analysed by this method. Every combination of RNA virus was able to be detected and a full complement of all four viruses were found together in three isolates, all taken from wild strawberry (Fragaria chiloensis (L.) Duch.) in Chile. The upper detection limit for the four viruses was at an extract dilution of 1 / 200. The broad applicability of the RNA specific internal control primers—which produced a PCR fragment of the expected size in 25 of 27 plant species tested—combined with improvements, made in extraction methods described provides potentially a standard method for comparable RT-PCR analyses {{in a wide variety of}} plant species...|$|E

40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{performed}} a pest categorisation of <b>Strawberry</b> <b>vein</b> <b>banding</b> virus (SVBV) for the European Union (EU) territory. SVBV is a well-defined virus {{species of the}} genus Caulimovirus for which the entire genome sequence is known and molecular detection assays are available. SVBV is transmitted by vegetative multiplication of infected hosts and through the activity of aphid vectors, the most efficient being Chaetosiphon spp. The virus is reported from all continents and is present in three EU Member States: the Czech Republic, Italy and Slovakia. The host range of SVBV is restricted to cultivated and wild strawberries. It is listed in Annex IAI of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. SVBV {{is not expected to}} be affected by ecoclimatic conditions wherever its hosts are present and has the potential to establish in large parts of the EU territory, and to subsequently spread through the action of its Chaetosiphon fragaefolii vector, which is present in many Member States. SVBV does not cause severe symptoms, and modern cultivars are mostly symptomless if infected with SVBV alone. SVBV can, however, contribute to more severe symptoms when it occurs in mixed infections with other strawberry viruses. Despite this, SVBV is considered a minor problem in strawberry production as a consequence of modern practices including the systematic use of certified planting materials and the use of short crop cycles, which have greatly reduced the impact of strawberry viruses. Overall, SVBV does not have {{the potential to be a}} quarantine pest as, given current agricultural practices, it does not fulfil the pest categorisation criteria defined in the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No 11 of having a severe impact. However, SVBV has the potential to be a regulated non-quarantine pest because it fulfils all pest categorisation criteria defined in the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No 21...|$|E

Essas partículas têm um capsídeo aparentemente icosaedral, constituído de 92 capsômeros de 50 - 60 A de diâmetro. Quando tratadas com acetato de uranila, revelaram a existência de uma zona central, que se impregna fortemente com êste corante, possìvelmente constituída de nucleoproteína. Tais partículas não foram encontradas em plantas sadias, mas foram nelas detectadas, após serem inoculadas por união de tecidos, por meios mecânicos ou por afídeos com VFANC. Partículas similares foram encontradas em secções ultra-finas de tecido foliar de couve infetado com o VFANC, porém apresentavam um diâmetro ligeiramente menor, da ordem de 35 - 45 m&# 956;.

40|$|BackgroundSurgical and catheter-based {{interventions}} on pulmonary veins {{are associated}} with pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS), which can progress diffusely through the “upstream” pulmonary veins. The mechanism has been rarely studied. We used a porcine model of PVS to assess disease progression with emphasis on the potential role of endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). MethodsNeonatal piglets underwent bilateral pulmonary <b>vein</b> <b>banding</b> (banded, n =  6) or sham operations (sham, n =  6). Additional piglets underwent identical banding and stent implantation in a single-banded pulmonary vein 3 weeks postbanding (stented, n =  6). At 7 weeks postbanding, hemodynamics and upstream PV pathology were assessed. ResultsBanded piglets developed pulmonary hypertension. The upstream pulmonary veins exhibited intimal thickening associated with features of EndMT, including increased transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1 and Smad expression, loss of endothelial and gain of mesenchymal marker expression, and coexpression of endothelial and mesenchymal markers in <b>banded</b> pulmonary <b>vein</b> intimal cells. These immunopathologic changes and a prominent myofibroblast phenotype in the remodeled pulmonary veins were consistently identified in specimens from patients with PVS, in vitro TGF-β 1 -stimulated cells isolated from piglet and human pulmonary veins, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. After stent implantation, decompression of a pulmonary vein was associated with reappearance of endothelial marker expression, suggesting the potential for plasticity in the observed pathologic changes, followed by rapid in-stent restenosis. ConclusionsNeonatal pulmonary <b>vein</b> <b>banding</b> in piglets recapitulates critical aspects of clinical PVS and highlights a pathologic profile consistent with EndMT, supporting the rationale for evaluating therapeutic strategies designed to exploit reversibility of upstream pulmonary vein pathology...|$|R

In this study, the complete sequence of the tripartite RNA genome of MVBaV was determined and analyzed. The L RNA has 8905 nucleotides (nt) and encodes the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of 2877 aa amino acids (aa) in the viral complementary (vc) strand. The RdRp of MVBaV shares the highest aa sequence identity (85. 9 %) with that of Watermelon silver mottle virus (WSMoV), and contains conserved motifs shared with those of the species of the genus Tospovirus. The M RNA contains 4731 nt and codes in ambisense arrangement for the NSm protein of 309 aa in the sense strand and the Gn/Gc glycoprotein precursor (GP) of 1, 124 aa in the vc strand. The NSm and GP of MVBaV share the highest aa sequence identities with those of Capsicum chlorosis virus (CaCV) and Groundnut bud necrosis virus (GBNV) (83. 2 % and 84. 3 %, respectively). The S RNA is 3294 nt in length and contains two open reading frames (ORFs) in an ambisense coding strategy, encoding a 439 -aa non-structural protein (NSs) and the 277 -aa nucleocapsid protein (N), respectively. The NSs and N also share the highest aa sequence identity (71. 1 % and 74. 4 %, respectively) with those of CaCV. Phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp, NSm, GP, NSs, and N proteins showed that MVBaV is most closely related to CaCV and GBNV and that these proteins cluster with those of the WSMoV serogroup, and that MVBaV seems to be a species bridging the two subgroups within the WSMoV serogroup of tospoviruses in evolutionary aspect, suggesting that MVBaV represents a distinct tospovirus.

Mutation of Lys 47 (Walker motif A) and Asp 88 :Glu 89 (Walker motif B) to alanine in E 191 A VPg-Pro lead to reduced ATPase activity, confirming that this activity was inherent to VPg.

Using a recombinant system, we {{provide evidence that}} disassembly and reassembly of Pepper <b>vein</b> <b>banding</b> virus (PVBV), {{a member of the}} genus potyvirus, proceeds via a ring-like intermediate, and show that electrostatic interactions may be pivotal in stabilizing the particles. Although the surface-exposed N- and C-terminal residues can be removed from the virus-like particles (VLPs) by limited trypsinization without affecting their stability, such truncated CP subunits are unable to form VLPs. To further evaluate importance of these residues, N- and C-terminal deletion mutants were generated and their assembly behavior was investigated. N-terminal 53 and C-terminal 23 amino acids were found to be crucial for the intersubunit interactions involved in the initiation of virus assembly. These segments are surface exposed in the ring-like intermediate and dispensable for further interactions that result {{in the formation of the}} VLPs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEarly {{detection}} of right ventricular (RV) involvement in chronic pulmonary hypertension (PH) is essential due to prognostic implications. T 1 mapping by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) {{has emerged as}} a noninvasive technique for extracellular volume fraction (ECV) quantification. We assessed the association of myocardial native T 1 time and equilibrium contrast ECV (Eq-ECV) at the RV insertion points with pulmonary hemodynamics and RV performance in an experimental model of chronic PH. Right heart catheterization followed by immediate CMR was performed on 38 pigs with chronic PH (generated by surgical pulmonary <b>vein</b> <b>banding)</b> and 6 sham-operated controls. Native T 1 and Eq-ECV values at the RV insertion points were both significantly higher in banded animals than in controls and showed significant correlation with pulmonary hemodynamics, RV arterial coupling, and RV performance. Eq-ECV values also increased before overt RV systolic dysfunction, offering potential for the early {{detection of}} myocardial involvement in chronic PH...|$|R

40|$|Yam virus {{diseases}} were surveyed for 3 years in Burkino Faso. Mosaic and green <b>vein</b> <b>banding</b> symptoms were observed on two species (#Dioscorea cayenensis rotundata$ and #Dioscorea alata$) in the south-west and southern aeras, {{and on the}} Pilimpikou yam cultivar in the central area. Using electron microscopy, ELISA and host range studies, {{it was found that}} plants were infected with a potyvirus similar to yam mosaic virus in host range, morphology and serology. This virus was not detected in the southern area but occurred at a low rate (13 %) in the south-west and more frequently (71. 5 %) in the central aera. Healthy yam plants were exposed to natural infection for 5 months in these two areas and checked for virus contamination by ELISA. Tubers from markets were also checked. During crop growth, in natural conditions, disease contamination was relatively slight compared with that in tubers from markets. The reliability of virus detection methods is discussed.
