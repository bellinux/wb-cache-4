However, because of high vapor pressure of ZnO, growth from the melt is problematic. Growth by gas transport is difficult to control, leaving the hydrothermal method as a preference. Thin films can be produced by chemical vapor deposition, metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, electrodeposition, pulsed laser deposition, sputtering, <b>sol-gel</b> synthesis, atomic layer deposition, spray pyrolysis, etc.|$|E

25|$|The {{interest}} in <b>sol-gel</b> processing {{can be traced}} back in the mid-1800s with the observation that the hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) under acidic conditions {{led to the formation of}} SiO2 in the form of fibers and monoliths. <b>Sol-gel</b> research grew to be so important that in the 1990s more than 35,000 papers were published worldwide on the process.|$|E

One of the more important applications of <b>sol-gel</b> processing is to carry out zeolite synthesis.

25|$|In {{materials}} science, the <b>sol-gel</b> {{process is}} a method for producing solid materials from small molecules.

The process involves conversion of monomers into a colloidal solution (sol) that acts as the precursor for an integrated network (or gel) of either discrete particles or network polymers. Typical precursors are metal alkoxides.|$|E
25|$|The {{precursor}} sol can {{be either}} deposited on a substrate to form a film (e.g., by dip coating or spin coating), cast into a suitable container with the desired shape (e.g., to obtain monolithic ceramics, glasses, fibers, membranes, aerogels), or used to synthesize powders (e.g., microspheres, nanospheres).

Even small quantities of dopants, such as organic dyes and rare-earth elements, can be introduced in the sol and end up uniformly dispersed in the final product. It {{can be used in}} ceramics processing and manufacturing as an investment casting material, or as a means of producing very thin films of metal oxides for various purposes. <b>Sol-gel</b> derived materials have diverse applications in optics, electronics, energy, space, (bio)sensors, medicine (e.g., controlled drug release), reactive material and separation (e.g., chromatography) technology.|$|E
25|$|Methylcellulose (MC) is a {{material}} with well-defined <b>sol-gel</b> transitions in the optimal range of temperatures. MC gelation occurs {{because of an}} increase in intra- and inter-molecular hydrophobic interactions as the temperature increases. The <b>sol-gel</b> transition is governed by the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), which is the temperature at which the elastic modulus equals the viscous modulus. The LCST must not exceed physiological temperature (37°C) if the scaffold is to gel upon implantation, creating a minimally invasive delivery. Following implantation into a TBI lesion cavity or peripheral nerve guidance conduit, MC elicits a minimal inflammatory response. It is also very important for minimally invasive delivery that the MC solution has a viscosity at temperatures below its LCST, which allows it to be injected through a small gauge needle for implantation in in vivo applications. MC has been successfully used as a delivery agent for intra-optical and oral pharmaceutical therapies. Some disadvantages of MC include its limited propensity for protein adsorption and neuronal cellular adhesion making it a non-bioactive hydrogel. Due to these disadvantages, use of MC in neural tissue regeneration requires attaching a biologically active group onto the polymer backbone in order to enhance cell adhesion.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sol-gel</b> {{process is}} a wet-chemical {{technique}} used for the fabrication of both glassy and ceramic materials. In this process, the sol (or solution) evolves gradually towards {{the formation of a}} gel-like network containing both a liquid phase and a solid phase. Typical precursors are metal alkoxides and metal chlorides, which undergo hydrolysis and polycondensation reactions to form a colloid. The basic structure or morphology of the solid phase can range anywhere from discrete colloidal particles to continuous chain-like polymer networks.|$|E
25|$|In {{materials}} science, the Citrate-gel {{method is}} a process similar to the <b>sol-gel</b> method, which is a method for producing solid materials from small molecules. During the synthetic process, metal salts or alkoxides are introduced into a citric acid solution. The formation of citric complexes is believed to balance the difference in individual behaviour of ions in solution, which results in a better distribution of ions and prevents the separation of components at later process stages. The polycondensation of ethylene glycol and citric acid starts above 100ºС, resulting in polymer citrate gel formation.|$|E
25|$|Other {{products}} fabricated {{with this}} process include various ceramic membranes for microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, pervaporation and reverse osmosis. If the liquid in a wet gel is removed under a supercritical condition, a highly porous and extremely low density material called aerogel is obtained. Drying the gel {{by means of}} low temperature treatments (25-100°C), {{it is possible to}} obtain porous solid matrices called xerogels. In addition, a <b>sol-gel</b> process was developed in the 1950s for the production of radioactive powders of UO2 and ThO2 for nuclear fuels, without generation of large quantities of dust.|$|E
25|$|In {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI), a series of damaging events is initiated that lead to cell death and overall dysfunction, which cause {{the formation of an}} irregularly-shaped lesion cavity. The resulting cavity causes many problems for tissue-engineered scaffolds because invasive implantation is required, and often the scaffold does not conform to the cavity shape. In order to get around these difficulties, thermo-responsive hydrogels have been engineered to undergo solution-gelation (<b>sol-gel)</b> transitions, which are caused by differences in room and physiological temperatures, to facilitate implantation through in situ gelation and conformation to cavity shape caused, allowing them to be injected in a minimally invasively manner.|$|E
25|$|Macroscopic optical {{elements}} and active optical components {{as well as}} large area hot mirrors, cold mirrors, lenses and beam splitters all with optimal geometry can be made quickly and at low cost via the <b>sol-gel</b> route. In the processing of high performance ceramic nanomaterials with superior opto-mechanical properties under adverse conditions, {{the size of the}} crystalline grains is determined largely {{by the size of the}} crystalline particles present in the raw material during the synthesis or formation of the object. Thus a reduction of the original particle size well below the wavelength of visible light (~500nm) eliminates much of the light scattering, resulting in a translucent or even transparent material.|$|E
25|$|Sonication is an {{efficient}} {{tool for the}} synthesis of polymers. The cavitational shear forces, which stretch out and break the chain in a non-random process, result in a lowering of the molecular weight and poly-dispersity. Furthermore, multi-phase systems are very efficient dispersed and emulsified, so that very fine mixtures are provided. This means that ultrasound increases the rate of polymerisation over conventional stirring and results in higher molecular weights with lower polydispersities. Ormosils (organically modified silicate) are obtained when silane is added to gel-derived silica during <b>sol-gel</b> process. The product is a molecular-scale composite with improved mechanical properties. Sono-Ormosils are characterized by a higher density than classic gels {{as well as an}} improved thermal stability. An explanation therefore might be the increased degree of polymerization.|$|E
25|$|A superhydrophobic {{surface is}} a low energy, {{generally}} rough surface on which water has a contact angle of >150°. Nonpolar materials such as hydrocarbons traditionally have relatively low surface energies, however this property alone {{is not sufficient to}} achieve superhydrophobicity. Superhydrophobic surfaces can be created in a number of ways, however most of the synthesis strategies are inspired by natural designs. The Cassie-Baxter model provides and explanation for superhydropbicity—air trapped in microgrooves of a rough surface create a “composite” surface consisting of air and the tops of microprotrusions. This structure is maintained as the scale of the features decreases, thus many approaches to the synthesis of superhydrophobic surfaces have focused on the fractal contribution. Wax solidification, lithography, vapor deposition, template methods, polymer reconfirmation, sublimation, plasma, electrospinning, <b>sol-gel</b> processing, electrochemical methods, hydrothermal synthesis, layer-by-layer deposition, and one-pot reactions are approaches to the creation of superhydrophobic surfaces that have been suggested.|$|E
25|$|By definition, {{condensation}} liberates a small molecule, such {{as water}} or alcohol. This type of reaction can continue to build larger and larger silicon-containing molecules {{by the process of}} polymerization. Thus, a polymer is a huge molecule (or macromolecule) formed from hundreds or thousands of units called monomers. The number of bonds that a monomer can form is called its functionality. Polymerization of silicon alkoxide, for instance, can lead to complex branching of the polymer, because a fully hydrolyzed monomer Si(OH)4 is tetrafunctional (can branch or bond in 4 different directions). Alternatively, under certain conditions (e.g., low water concentration) fewer than 4 of the OR or OH groups (ligands) will be capable of condensation, so relatively little branching will occur. The mechanisms of hydrolysis and condensation, and the factors that bias the structure toward linear or branched structures are the most critical issues of <b>sol-gel</b> science and technology. This reaction is favored in both basic and acidic conditions.|$|E
25|$|The photo-isomerization of {{azobenzene}} {{is a form}} of light-induced molecular motion. This isomerization {{can also}} lead to motion on larger length scales. For instance, polarized light will cause the molecules to isomerize and relax in random positions. However, those relaxed (trans) molecules that fall perpendicular to the incoming light polarization will {{no longer be able to}} absorb, and will remain fixed. Thus, there is a statistical enrichment of chromophores perpendicular to polarized light (orientational hole burning). Polarized irradiation will make an azo-material anisotropic and therefore optically birefringent and dichroic. This photo-orientation can also be used to orient other materials (especially in liquid crystal systems). For instance, it has been used to orient liquid crystal domains selectively, and to create nonlinear optical (NLO) materials.-sonogel glasses|journal=Journal of <b>Sol-Gel</b> Science and Technology|year=2010|volume=56|issue=1|pages=7–18|doi=10.1007/s10971-010-2265-y|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/f06488h188176783/}} Azo isomerization can also be used to photo-switch the liquid crystal phase of a material from cholesteric to nematic or to change the pitch of a cholesteric phase.|$|E

2500|$|Silica aerogels are {{typically}} synthesized {{by using a}} <b>sol-gel</b> process. The first step {{is the creation of}} a colloidal suspension of solid particles known as a [...] "sol". The precursors are a liquid alcohol such as ethanol which is mixed with a silicon alkoxide, such as tetramethoxysilane (TMOS), tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), and polyethoxydisiloxane (PEDS) (earlier work used sodium silicates). The solution of silica is mixed with a catalyst and allowed to gel during a hydrolysis reaction which forms particles of silicon dioxide. The oxide suspension begins to undergo condensation reactions which result in the creation of metal oxide bridges (either M–O–M, [...] "oxo" [...] bridges or M–OH–M, [...] "ol" [...] bridges) linking the dispersed colloidal particles. [...] These reactions generally have moderately slow reaction rates, and as a result either acidic or basic catalysts are used to improve the processing speed.
