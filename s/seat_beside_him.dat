Ray Millar, the band's drummer, was not with them as he had chosen {{to go to his}} home town of Antrim to spend the night with his parents. The band's road manager, Brian Maguire, had already gone ahead a few minutes earlier in the equipment van. At about 2:30, when the band was seven miles (11km) north of Newry on the main A1 road, their Volkswagen minibus (driven by trumpeter Brian McCoy with Stephen Travers in the front <b>seat</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him)</b> reached the townland of Buskhill. Near the junction with Buskhill Road they were flagged down by armed men dressed in British Army uniforms waving a red torch in a circular motion. During [...] "The Troubles" [...] it was normal for the British Army to set up checkpoints at any time.|$|E

60|$|He {{was seated}} thus, with head {{leaning against the}} pane, when another young man came down the aisle from the smoking-car and took a <b>seat</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> with a {{pleasant}} word.|$|E
60|$|The Indian {{started at}} the question, which evidently {{recalled}} his recollection to earth. Taking her hand, he drew Miss Temple to a <b>seat</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> {{and pointed to the}} country beneath them.|$|E

60|$|Two Moon, a {{handsome}} broad-shouldered man of fifty, met {{us at the}} door of the Dance Lodge, welcomed us with courtly grace, and gave us <b>seats</b> <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> on the honor side of the circle.
