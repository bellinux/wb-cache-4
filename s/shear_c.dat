The experimental results for this reversibly flocculated system show a shear-rate-dependent power law behavior of the dielectric susceptibility in a frequency range above 100 Hz. A structural explanation for this dielectric behavior is suggested. At lower frequencies resonance phenomena are observed. At a shear-rate-dependent frequency a maximum polarization is found, while time-dependent measurements in a constant electric field show a slight minimum in conductivity.

It has observed that the specimen configuration {{had a significant effect}} on the strength and failure mechanism of a self-piercing riveted multi-layer joint. During shear testing, when secondary bending was present interlock failure was observed, while in the absence of secondary bending, sheet material failure occurred. Interlock and sheet material failure modes were also observed in T-peel tests, where depending on the configuration, either substrate failure led to peeling the top sheet away from the rivet head, or interlock failure resulted in pulling the rivet out of the bottom sheet. In the cases where the sheet material failed, an increase in sheet material strength led to an increase in joint strength. Under identical setting conditions, joints with double shear and no secondary bending effect exhibited significantly higher shear strength and more energy absorption than joints in single <b>shear.</b> (<b>c)</b> 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|International audienceNonlinear Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (NRUS) {{has been}} used {{extensively}} {{over the last two}} decades to quantify, through the nonlinear parameter α, the hysteretic nonlinearity of materials for geophysical, biomedical, and civil engineering applications. This technique relies on the variations of the damping and frequency of a resonance mode with the amplitude of this mode. A typical NRUS experiment is conducted on a long bar using its first longitudinal mode. In some experiments, higher order modes have been used because the nonlinearity was more pronounced but the type of motion involved has not been characterized. The parameter α measured from these experiments is then used to calibrate a 1 D model of the non-classical nonlinearity. As a first step toward extending this model from 1 D to 3 D, experiments were conducted on long bar samples (assumed to be macroscopically isotropic) where modes are excited selectively and the type of motion involved in each mode is well characterized. In this simple isotropic case, longitudinal and torsional motions are decoupled in order to find the α 11 and α 44 parameters that correspond to the compression (C 11) and <b>shear</b> (<b>C</b> 44) moduli, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} is {{the prime}} non-destructive characterization tool for graphene and related layered materials. The <b>shear</b> (<b>C)</b> and layer breathing modes (LBMs) are due to relative motions of the planes, either perpendicular or parallel to their normal. This allows one to directly probe the interlayer interactions in multilayer samples. Graphene and other two-dimensional (2 d) crystals can be combined to form various hybrids and heterostructures, creating materials on demand with properties determined by the interlayer interaction. This is the case even for a single material, where multilayer stacks with different relative orientation have different optical and electronic properties. In twisted multilayer graphene samples {{there is a significant}} enhancement of the C modes due to resonance with new optically allowed electronic transitions, determined by the relative orientation of the layers. Here we show that this applies also to the LBMs, that can be now directly measured at room temperature. We find that twisting does not affect LBMs, quite different from the case of the C modes. This implies that the periodicity mismatch between two twisted layers mostly affects shear interactions. Our work shows that Raman spectroscopy is an ideal tool to uncover the interface coupling of 2 d hybrids and heterostructures. Comment: ACS Nano, 2015, 9 (7), 7440 - 744...|$|E

Non-adhesive coatings, like polymer brush-coatings, have so far only been investigated with respect to preventing initial bacterial adhesion, but never with respect to effects on kinetics of bacterial growth. Here, we compare adhesion and 20 h growth of three bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) on pristine and brush-coated silicone rubber in a parallel plate flow chamber. Brush-coatings were made using a tri-block copolymer of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polypropylene oxide (PPO). Brush-coatings prevented adhesion of staphylococci to below 5 x 105 cm(- 2) after 30 min, which is a 10 -fold reduction compared to pristine silicone rubber. Biofilms grew on both brush-coated and pristine silicone rubber, while the viability of biofilms on brush-coatings was higher than on pristine silicone rubber. However biofilms on, brush-coatings developed more slowly and detached almost fully by high fluid shear. Brush-coating remained non-adhesive after S. epidermidis biofilm formation and subsequent removal whereas a part of its functionality was lost after removal of S. aureus biofilms. Adhesion, growth and detachment of P. aeruginosa {{were not significantly different}} on brush-coatings as compared with pristine silicone rubber, although here too the viability of biofilms on brush-coatings was higher. We conclude that polymer brush-coatings strongly reduce initial adhesion of staphylococci and delay their biofilm growth.

The Raman spectra on three different substrates verify the negligible substrate effect on the phonon frequencies of ML MoTe 2. Ten excitation energies are {{used to measure the}} high-frequency modes of N-layer MoTe 2 (NL MoTe 2; N is an integer). Under the resonant excitation condition, we observe N-dependent Davydov components in ML MoTe 2, originating from the Raman-active A' 1 (A 21 g) modes at ~ 172 cm- 1. More than two Davydov components are observed in NL MoTe 2 for N larger than 4 by Raman spectroscopy. The N-dependent Davydov components are further investigated based on the symmetry analysis. A van der Waals model only considering the nearest interlayer coupling has been proposed to well understand the Davydov splitting of high-frequency A' 1 (A 21 g) modes. The different resonant profiles for the two Davydov components in 3 L MoTe 2 indicate that proper excitation energy of ~ 1. 8 - 2. 2 eV must be chosen to observe the Davydov splitting in ML MoTe 2. Our work presents a simple way to identify layer number of ultrathin MoTe 2 flakes by the corresponding number and peak position of Davydov components. Our work also provides a direct evidence from Raman spectroscopy of how the nearest van der Waals interactions significantly affect the frequency of the high-frequency intralayer phonon modes in multilayer MoTe 2 and expands the understanding on the lattice vibrations and interlayer coupling of transition metal dichalcogenides and other two-dimensional materials.

40|$|Most {{works on}} {{geophysics}} assume laws of damping {{according to which}} the creep under constant stress would be proportional to the time or to its logarithm. Both contradict strong geophysical evidence. The most direct evidence indicates that creep under small stresses increases about like to*'. This rule is tested by application to several geophysical and astronomical phenomena and leads to satisfactory explanations. The data, however, concern average properties of the Earth's shell and attention is needed to possible variation of the properties with depth. A good deal of information about imperfection of elasticity in solids existed in the 1920 's. For perfect elasticity if a shear stress P is applied at time t = 0 the shear is immediately e 0 = P / p where p is the rigidity. But in most rocks, if c 0 is more than about there is fracture; the displacements then at first increase like the time and may become large. But there was information at much smaller stresses. Many workers had found that if a shear stress is maintained after the initial <b>shear</b> <b>c</b> 0 the shear increased continuously. Some got an increase like the logarithm of the time, others, notably Andrade, like t). An obvious dilliculty about these was that as t-+ 0, dgfdt-P 03, which is not true even immediately after fracture. P. Phillips in 1903 remarked, however, that this difficulty can be avoided if the time in these formulae is measured from some time a little before that of application of the stress; but this was apparently completely forgotten until C. Lomnitz rediscovered and restated it in 1956. Imperfection of elasticity in the tides raised by the Earth in the Moon was adopted by various authors, especially Sir George Darwin, as {{an explanation of the}} fact that the Moon keeps a constant face to the Earth apart from some small oscillations. But no quantitative test was made, (or indeed was possible at the time). Darwin m his monumental papers on tidal friction treated the bodies as liquid of high viscosity, but his results are fairly easily adapted to other linear laws. He mentions the Maxwell-Butcher law known as elasticoviscosity, according to which the creep under constant shear stress is proportional to the time.
