5|$|In 2016 a {{breakthrough}} in creating a <b>strong</b> <b>light</b> aluminium steel alloy which might be suitable in applications such as aircraft was announced by researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology. Adding small amounts of nickel was found to result in precipitation as nano particles of brittle B2 intermetallic compounds which had previously resulted in weakness. The result was a cheap <b>strong</b> <b>light</b> steel alloy—nearly as strong as titanium at 10% of the cost—which is slated for trial production at industrial scale by POSCO, a Korean steelmaker.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} {{cut into the}} backdrop {{and covered with a}} transparent material. A <b>strong</b> <b>light</b> behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to be made of large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.|$|E
5|$|These SWNT forests (buckypaper) {{were grown}} by the super-growth CVD method to about 10 μm height. Two factors could {{contribute}} to <b>strong</b> <b>light</b> absorption by these structures: (i) a distribution of CNT chiralities resulted in various bandgaps for individual CNTs. Thus a compound material was formed with broadband absorption. (ii) Light might be trapped in those forests due to multiple reflections.|$|E

5|$|Remains {{thought to}} belong to Nigersaurus were first {{discovered}} during a 1965–72 expedition to the Republic of Niger led by French paleontologist Philippe Taquet, and first mentioned in a paper published in 1976. Although a common genus, the dinosaur had been poorly known until more material of other individuals was discovered during expeditions led by American palaeontologist Paul Sereno in 1997 and 2000. The limited understanding of the genus {{was the result of}} poor preservation of its remains, which arises from the delicate and highly pneumatic construction of the skull and skeleton, in turn causing disarticulation of the fossils. Some of the skull fossils were so thin that a <b>strong</b> <b>light</b> beam was visible through them. Therefore, no intact skulls or articulated skeletons have been found, and these specimens represent the most complete known rebbachisaurid remains.|$|E

Despite Frank's worries that his wife will not love him if she should see his scarred face, Frank consents to the operation. The operation is a success and the doctor warns May not to remove the bandages as she will lose her sight again. May's desire to see her child {{is so strong that}} she removes the bandages and gazes upon her child. Upon trying to gaze upon her husband, who is standing in <b>strong</b> <b>light,</b> May is permanently blinded. The film concludes with May being content with her blindness and knowing that her baby is as beautiful.|$|E

25|$|Plants have {{mechanisms}} that protect against {{adverse effects of}} <b>strong</b> <b>light.</b> The most studied biochemical protective mechanism is non-photochemical quenching of excitation energy. Visible-light-induced photoinhibition is ~25% faster in an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lacking non-photochemical quenching than in the wild type. It is also apparent that turning or folding of leaves, as occurs, e.g., in Oxalis species in response to exposure to high light, protects against photoinhibition.|$|E

Besides protection of user and sample material, the human design factors (ergonomics) of the work become more and more important. This includes reduction of the noise level (for a more convenient working atmosphere), a height adjustable stand or stool (for optimized sitting position), panorama side windows (more light within cabinet), 10°angled front sash (enables better sitting position) as well as <b>strong</b> <b>light</b> sources (better view within cabinet) to improve the working conditions.|$|E

25|$|<b>Strong</b> <b>light</b> {{causes the}} {{reduction}} of the plastoquinone pool, which leads to protonation and double reduction (and double protonation) of the QA electron acceptor of Photosystem II. The protonated and double-reduced forms of QA do not function in electron transport. Furthermore, charge recombination reactions in inhibited Photosystem II are expected to lead to the triplet state of the primary donor (P680) more probably than same reactions in active PSII. Triplet P680 may react with oxygen to produce harmful singlet oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Light {{trespass}} {{occurs when}} unwanted light enters one's property, for instance, by shining over a neighbor's fence. A common light trespass problem {{occurs when a}} <b>strong</b> <b>light</b> enters the window of one's home from the outside, causing problems such as sleep deprivation. A number of cities in the U.S. have developed standards for outdoor lighting {{to protect the rights}} of their citizens against light trespass. To assist them, the International Dark-Sky Association has developed a set of model lighting ordinances.|$|E
25|$|Sunglasses or sun {{glasses are}} a visual aid which feature lenses that are {{coloured}} or darkened to prevent <b>strong</b> <b>light</b> {{from reaching the}} eyes. For centuries, Chinese judges had routinely worn smoke-colored quartz lenses to conceal their eye expressions in court. However, these were not intended for blocking sunlight from eyes. It wasn't until the 20th century that what is now considered to be sunglasses were invented. In 1929, Sam Foster invented and mass-produced the first tinted eyewear pieces solely intended to block out sunlight.|$|E

40|$|<b>Strong</b> <b>lighting</b> {{is common}} in natural scenes yet is often viewed as a {{nuisance}} for object pose estimation and tracking. In human shape and pose estimation, cast shadows can be confused with foreground structure while self shadowing and shading variation on the body cause {{the appearance of the}} person to change with pose. Rather than attempt to minimize the effects of lighting and shadows, we show that <b>strong</b> <b>lighting</b> in a scene actually makes pose and shape estimation more robust. Additionally, by recovering multiple body poses we are able to automatically estimate the lighting in the scene and the albedo of the body. Our approach makes use of a detailed 3 D body model, the parameters of which are directly recovered from image data. We provide a thorough exploration of human pose estimation under <b>strong</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions and show: 1. the estimation of the light source from cast shadows; 2. the estimation of the light source and the albedo of the body from multiple body poses; 3. that a point light and cast shadows on the ground plane can be treated as an additional “shadow camera” that improves pose and shape recovery, particularly in monocular scenes. Additionally we introduce the notion of albedo constancy which employs lighting normalized image data for matching. Our experiments with multiple subjects show that rather than causing problems, <b>strong</b> <b>lighting</b> improves human pose and shape estimation. 1...|$|R

25|$|Photoinhibition occurs {{continuously}} when {{plants or}} cyanobacteria {{are exposed to}} light, and the photosynthesizing organism must, therefore, continuously repair the damage. The PSII repair cycle, occurring in chloroplasts and in cyanobacteria, consists of degradation and synthesis of the D1 protein of the PSII reaction centre, followed by activation of the reaction center. Due to the rapid repair, most PSII reaction centers are not photoinhibited even if a plant is grown in <b>strong</b> <b>light.</b> However, environmental stresses, for example, extreme temperatures, salinity, and drought, limit the supply of carbon dioxide for use in carbon fixation, which decreases the rate of repair of PSII.|$|E
25|$|Photosystem II {{is damaged}} by light {{irrespective}} of light intensity. The quantum yield of the damaging reaction in typical leaves of higher plants exposed to visible light, {{as well as}} in isolated thylakoid membrane preparations, is in the range of 10−8 to 10−7 and independent of the intensity of light. This means that one PSII complex is damaged for every 10-100 million photons that are intercepted. Therefore, photoinhibition occurs at all light intensities and the rate constant of photoinhibition is directly proportional to light intensity. Some measurements suggest that dim light causes damage more efficiently than <b>strong</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hopper's seascapes {{fall into}} three main groups: pure landscapes of rocks, sea, and beach grass; lighthouses and farmhouses; and sailboats. Sometimes he {{combined}} these elements. Most of these paintings depict <b>strong</b> <b>light</b> and fair weather; he showed {{little interest in}} snow or rain scenes, or in seasonal color changes. He painted {{the majority of the}} pure seascapes in the period between 1916 and 1919 on Monhegan Island. Hopper's The Long Leg (1935) is a nearly all-blue sailing picture with the simplest of elements, while his Ground Swell (1939) is more complex and depicts a group of youngsters out for a sail, a theme reminiscent of Winslow Homer's iconic Breezing Up (1876).|$|E

25|$|In screen-printing a {{fine screen}} of bolting silk or similar {{material}} is stretched taut onto a frame {{similar to the}} way canvas is prepared before painting. A colloid sensitized with a dichromate is applied evenly to the taut screen. Once the dichromate mixture is dry, a full-size photographic negative is attached securely onto the surface of the screen, and the whole assembly exposed to <b>strong</b> <b>light</b> – typically about half an hour in bright sunlight – hardening the exposed colloid. When the negative is removed, the unexposed mixture on the screen can be washed off with warm water, leaving the hardened mixture intact, acting as a precise mask of the desired pattern, which can then be printed with the usual screen-printing process.|$|E
25|$|Rams {{head coach}} Clark Shaughnessy played Hirsch {{at the end}} position. In his first game for the Rams, a 27–24 victory over the Detroit Lions, Hirsch scored two touchdowns, {{including}} a 19-yard touchdown reception from Norm Van Brocklin. Over {{the course of the}} 1949 season, Hirsch tallied 326 receiving yards, 287 rushing yards, and 55 return yards on two interceptions. During the 1949 season, Hirsch also {{became one of the first}} NFL players to wear a plastic helmet. After Hirsch sustained a second head injury (having previously suffered a skull fracture in 1948), Rams coach Shaughnessy had a special, 11-ounce helmet designed for Hirsch, using a <b>strong,</b> <b>light</b> plastic that had been used previously in the construction of fighter planes.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} exam includes a systematic {{examination of the}} whole patient to assess general health and to look for signs of associated conditions and metastatic disease. The neck and supraclavicular fossa are palpated to feel for cervical adenopathy, other masses, and laryngeal crepitus. The oral cavity and oropharynx are examined under direct vision. The larynx may be examined by indirect laryngoscopy using a small angled mirror with a long handle (akin to a dentist's mirror) and a <b>strong</b> <b>light.</b> Indirect laryngoscopy can be highly effective, but requires skill and practice for consistent results. For this reason, many specialist clinics now use fibre-optic nasal endoscopy where a thin and flexible endoscope, inserted through the nostril, is used to clearly visualise the entire pharynx and larynx. Nasal endoscopy is a quick and easy procedure performed in clinic. Local anaesthetic spray may be used.|$|E
