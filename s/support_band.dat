5|$|The {{beginning}} of 1982 {{was marred by}} both Downey and Gorham having to take breaks from the European tour to recover from personal problems. Downey {{was involved in a}} fight in a nightclub in Denmark in February, and Gorham was suffering from drug-induced exhaustion. Downey missed five concerts, and was replaced by Mark Nauseef again for three of them, and by Mike Mesbur of <b>support</b> <b>band</b> The Lookalikes for the other two. In March, Gorham collapsed and returned home; eight concerts were performed as a quartet and six others were postponed.|$|E

25|$|In 1973, the J.T. Benson Company of Nashville, Tennessee bought Charisma re-releasing {{the album}} on its Impact Records imprint as The Archers. By this time The Archers {{included}} a full <b>support</b> <b>band</b> with Tim Jacquette (bass), Tim Johnson (keyboards) and Tim Short (drums) {{all of whom}} had played on the first album and in earlier concert appearances. With an increasing national profile, the group continued to expand their schedule, appearing in churches and larger concert venues nationwide and Canada.|$|E
25|$|In photonics, band gaps or stop {{bands are}} ranges of photon {{frequencies}} where, if tunneling effects are neglected, no photons {{can be transmitted}} through a material. A material exhibiting this behaviour {{is known as a}} photonic crystal. The concept of hyperuniformity has broadened the range of photonic band gap materials, beyond photonic crystals. By applying the technique in supersymmetric quantum mechanics, a new class of optical disordered materials have been suggested, which <b>support</b> <b>band</b> gaps perfectly equivalent to those of crystals or quasicrystals.|$|E
25|$|The {{group was}} formed in Cambridge by Bor, Smith, and Wykes, three school friends who shared a fondness for The Shangri-Las and The Undertones. Dolly Mixture {{supported}} The Undertones {{on one of their}} first UK tours. The band also played venues with The Fall and The Transmitters in 1979. They were once supported by U2. In Autumn 1981, they toured as the featured <b>support</b> <b>band</b> for Bad Manners on their Gosh It's tour and were very well received by the second wave mod/ska audience that filled various theatres and venues up and down the land.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} the King of Fools album allowed the band to tour the UK {{for the first time}} {{comprehensively}} in 1997's 'd:tour'. Delirious? chose to tour without a <b>support</b> <b>band,</b> instead using a DJ and a large visual aspect to the performance. In 1998, the band released their second live album, , which featured many of the songs from the King Of Fools album in addition to some songs from the Cutting Edge period. It was recorded at Southampton Guildhall on the final night of the 'd:tour'.|$|E
25|$|As 1967 {{ended the}} band's career reached a {{critical}} juncture. They {{still had no}} songwriter, and both drummer Steve Hopgood and lead guitarist Tony Sommers were becoming disenchanted with the band's erratic fortunes. Keays decided to replace them and also their second manager, Tony Dickstein. In Sydney, Keays met two brothers, bass guitarist and singer Denny Burgess (ex-The Throb), and drummer Colin Burgess, both had played in a <b>support</b> <b>band,</b> The Haze, at a gig in suburban Ashfield. Keays was impressed and considered them for possible new members.|$|E
25|$|The album The Wildhearts Must Be Destroyed, {{released}} in 2003, {{had a very}} commercial sound, full of short simple pop songs with little of the heavier rock style which often featured on previous albums. The band also {{managed to get a}} US record deal with Gearhead Records, which released Riff After Riff in 2004, a compilation of songs from the UK post-reformation singles (all of the songs from this release are also found on the Gut Records compilation Coupled With). Riff After Riff was the Wildhearts' first US release since Earth vs the Wildhearts in 1994. The release was also promoted by a tour, mostly as the <b>support</b> <b>band</b> for their ex-support band, The Darkness.|$|E

25|$|The new single was {{released}} in the UK on 11 January 1963 {{during one of the}} worst winters in British history and on 19 January most of the population were snowed-in at home watching the Beatles perform the song on the Saturday night TV show, Thank Your Lucky Stars. The national exposure of the song, as well as the unusual appearance and hair style of the group, brought the band a lot of attention and they were booked by promoter Arthur Howes for a series of national tours. The first tour was as a <b>support</b> <b>band</b> to Helen Shapiro in February, then Tommy Roe and Chris Montez in March, and Roy Orbison in May and, during breaks in the touring schedule, the Beatles performed the song on a number of BBC national radio programmes. All of these factors, along with extensive press coverage, propelled the single to the top of most of the British charts and the Beatles, much to their embarrassment, were moved {{to the top of the}} bill on the Tommy Roe and Roy Orbison tours.|$|E
500|$|They {{continued}} to perform regularly around Crawley (including The Rocket, St. Edward's, and Queen's Square in particular) throughout 1977 and 1978. On 19 February 1978 {{they were joined}} at The Rocket {{for the first time}} by a <b>support</b> <b>band</b> from Horley called Lockjaw, featuring bassist Simon Gallup. Hansa was dissatisfied with the group's demos and did not wish to release [...] "Killing an Arab". [...] The label suggested that the band attempt [...] cover versions instead. [...] They refused, and by March 1978 Easy Cure's contract with the label had been dissolved. Smith later recalled, [...] "We were very young. They just thought they could turn us into a teen group. They actually wanted us to do cover versions and we always refused." ...|$|E
500|$|Thin Lizzy, {{along with}} <b>support</b> <b>band</b> The Answer, were to support AC/DC at stadium shows in England, Ireland and Scotland {{at the end}} of June 2009, but these {{appearances}} were cancelled after drummer Aldridge broke his collarbone in an accident. On 30 June, the band's website confirmed that Sykes had left Thin Lizzy and all shows for the rest of 2009 were cancelled or postponed. Gorham stated that he would announce Thin Lizzy's future plans shortly. In a statement, he said, [...] "It's been a very tough time of late for myself and the band, firstly with drummer Tommy Aldridge's injury and now the subsequent decision for John {{and the rest of the}} group to go their separate ways. I can only apologise to everyone who has supported us over the years, but we will be back up to full speed soon." ...|$|E

500|$|Jason Aalon Butler, the band's front-man and {{remaining}} founding member, described the group's first releases, extended play Exhaustion, Saltwater, And Everything In Between (2004) and debut album Speak Like You Talk (2005), as [...] "educational experiences" [...] in writing whole songs rather than [...] "cool bits" [...] for songs. Music journalist Andrew Kelham {{wrote that the}} era these [...] "raw hardcore punk" [...] records were produced in was plagued by [...] "potential [...] was never realised as an ever-revolving door of musicians cause the band to limp through Jason's late teens and early twenties." [...] With the second album, Fake History, the band felt they found their [...] "signature sound". [...] In 2008, when performing as a substitute opening <b>support</b> <b>band</b> for Bring Me the Horizon's show in Los Angeles, they {{caught the attention of}} Brett Gurewitz, owner of Epitaph Records, who later signed the band and re-released their second album in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Raynor {{suffered}} a [...] "tragic loss" [...] during the West Coast minitour and flew home, forcing the band {{to find a}} fill-in drummer: Travis Barker of the ska punk <b>support</b> <b>band</b> The Aquabats. Barker learned the drum tracks for the band's set in only 45 minutes prior to his first show. Raynor returned for the band's Hollywood Palladium performance, and the band became increasingly uneasy and arguments grew worse. To offset personal issues, Raynor began to drink heavily and it began to affect the band's performances. Following a largely successful Australian tour in the spring, Hoppus and DeLonge presented an ultimatum: quit drinking or go to an [...] rehab. Raynor agreed to both and informed the band of his decision after taking the weekend to mull options. According to Raynor, he was fired through a phone call despite his agreement to rehab. Despite this, he felt no malice toward his former bandmates and conceded they were [...] "right" [...] to fire him.|$|E
500|$|The Cure's third single, [...] "Jumping Someone Else's Train", was {{released}} in early October 1979. Soon afterwards, Dempsey was dropped from the band because of his cold reception to material Smith had written for the upcoming album. Dempsey joined the Associates, while Simon Gallup (bass) and Matthieu Hartley (keyboards) from the Magspies joined the Cure. The Associates toured as <b>support</b> <b>band</b> for the Cure and the Passions on the Future Pastimes Tour of England between November and December—all three bands were on the Fiction Records roster—with the new Cure line-up already performing {{a number of new}} songs for the projected second album. Meanwhile, a spin-off band comprising Smith, Tolhurst, Dempsey, Gallup, Hartley, and Thompson, with backing vocals from assorted family and friends and lead vocals provided by their local postman Frankie Bell, released a 7-inch single in December under the name of Cult Hero. On 8 December 1979, the Cure were recorded from their first live TV special, at [...] in Paris, with three songs from the set, [...] "At Night", [...] "Three Imaginary Boys", and [...] "Killing An Arab", broadcast on 16 December.|$|E

500|$|Throughout 2012 La Dispute went on {{a series}} of {{headline}} tours that acted as promotion for Wildlife, with tour legs in Europe, Australia and North America. La Dispute's European tour took place over January and early February with support from Former Thieves. Their Australian tour started four days after their European tour, and instead of having a permanent <b>support</b> <b>band,</b> they had a different lineup every night, composed of local bands. The North American leg of the tour started in late March, lasting into June and had support from Balance and Composure, Sainthood Reps, and All Get Out. At their shows in the United States in April, the band collaborated with 826michigan once again to release 150 limited-edition packets at their shows. These packets included their CD [...] "Conversations", which annotates the lyrical themes in Wildlife in depth, along with rare photos, a poster, postcards and other items. In June 2012, the band made several festival appearances in Europe including Download Festival, Greenfield Festival, Hurricane Festival and Southside Festival, during a short European tour with Hot Water Music. La Dispute planned to do a third European tour with Title Fight and Make Do and Mend in September and October 2012.|$|E
500|$|The Cure {{released}} {{their debut}} album Three Imaginary Boys in May 1979. Because of the band's inexperience in the studio, Parry and engineer Mike Hedges {{took control of}} the recording. The band, particularly Smith, were unhappy with the album; in a 1987 interview, he admitted, [...] "a lot of it was very superficial – I didn't even like it at the time. There were criticisms made that it was very lightweight, and I thought they were justified. Even when we'd made it, I wanted to do something that I thought had more substance to it". The band's second single, [...] "Boys Don't Cry", was released in June. The Cure then embarked as the <b>support</b> <b>band</b> for Siouxsie and the Banshees' Join Hands promotional tour of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales between August and October. The tour saw Smith pull double duty each night by performing with the Cure and as the guitarist with the Banshees when John McKay quit the group in Aberdeen. That musical experience had a strong impact on him: [...] "On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello; the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing." ...|$|E
