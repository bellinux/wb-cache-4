Materials and Methods Sixty-four adult male Wistar rats (180 - 220 g weight) were randomly assigned to eight groups (n = 8). Group one received SIMV 20 mg/kg/day. Group two was given vehicle only. Groups three, five and seven received intraperitoneally (i. p) <b>sodium</b> <b>dichromate</b> at doses of 8, 12 and 16 mg/kg BW (Body Weight) for eight consecutive days, respectively. Groups four, six and eight pretreated with the 20 mg/kg SIMV 30 minutes to prior administration of <b>sodium</b> <b>dichromate</b> in a doses of 8, 12 and 16 mg/kg, respectively. The experiment repeated for eight consecutive days. Twenty-four hours after the last administration, animals were killed with overdose of sodium pentobarbital. Blood was collected for determination of malondialdehyd (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels. Results The level of GSH significantly decreased. In contrast, the plasma level of MDA significantly increased in a dose dependent manner in CrVI-treated rats, when compared to control animals. SIMV had no effect on the biochemical parameters when compared to control rats, but significantly increased GSH concentration and decreased MDA level in CrVI-treated rats.
