Zoological Studies 46 (1) : xxx-xxx. The spatial {{and temporal}} distribution patterns of Argentine the <b>short-finned</b> <b>squid,</b> <b>Illex</b> argentinus, abundances and relationships between the squid abundance and environmental variables in the Southwest Atlantic were analyzed using a geographical information system and statistical methods. The abundances of squid were estimated by standardizing commercial catch per unit effort (CPUE) data from the Taiwanese squid fishery during 1986 - 2003. Illex argentinus has a clear general annual migration pattern, which consistently occurred in different years. The monthly distribution patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) corresponded to the current systems in the Southwest Atlantic. Local squid abundances showed a negative correlation with SSTs during Mar. -Aug., although it was difficult to determine if this reflected any causal link.

Regarding Brazilian coast, industrial and urban developments are concentrated along Central South Brazil Bight. Samples from inshore and offshore species from the concerned area were analyzed, comprising 24 cetaceans (9 species) and 32 squids (2 species). Cadmium was deter-mined by GFAAS and our results were in agreement with certified values (DOLT- 2, NRCC). Mean cadmium concentration (in mg/g, wet weight) observed in the digestive gland of sexually mature Argentine <b>short-finned</b> <b>squids</b> (<b>Illex</b> argentinus) was 1002. 9. To our knowledge this is the highest cadmium level ever reported for a cephalopod.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The recent {{development}} of deep-water fisheries off Brazil is reviewed from biological, eco-nomic, and political perspectives. This {{process has been}} centered in the southeastern and southern sectors of the Brazilian coast (19 °- 34 °S) and was motivated by the overfishing of the main coastal resources and a gov-ernment-induced vessel-chartering program. Shelf break (100 - 250 m) operations by national hook-and-line and trawl vessels intensified in the 1990 s. Around 2000 - 2001, however, foreign-chartered longliners, gillnet-ters, potters, and trawlers started to operate in Brazilian waters, leading the occupation of the upper slope (250 - 500 m), mostly targeting monkfish (Lophyus gastrophysus), the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), the Bra-zilian codling (Urophycis mystacea), the wreckfish (Polyprion americanus), the Argentine <b>short-fin</b> <b>squid</b> (<b>Illex</b> argentinus), the red crab (Chaceon notialis), and the royal crab (Chaceon ramosae). Between 2004 and 2007, chartered trawlers established a valuable fishery on deep-water shrimps (family Aristeidae), heavily ex-ploiting the lower slope (500 - 1000 m). Total catches of deep-water resources varied annually from 5, 756 ton in 2000 {{to a maximum of}} 19, 923 ton in 2002, decreasing to nearly 11, 000 ton in 2006.

40|$|The {{relative}} abundance and fishing {{potential of the}} commercially valuable fishes and cephalopods with marketable size was assessed using two seasonal bottom trawl surveys performed in 2001 and 2002 on the outer shelf and upper slope (100 - 600 m depth) {{off the coast of}} southern Brazil. These surveys were part of REVIZEE, a national program designed to assess the fishery potential within the Economic Exclusive Zone. Of the 228 fish and cephalopod species caught during the surveys, only 27 species and genera were considered to be of commercial interest. Commercial-sized individuals of these species made up 52. 3 % of the total catch. The total biomass was estimated to be 167, 193 ton (± 22 %) and 165, 460 ton (± 25 %) in the winter-spring and summer-autumn surveys, respectively. The most abundant species were the Argentine <b>short-fin</b> <b>squid</b> <b>Illex</b> argentinas, a species with highly variable recruitment, followed by the Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi, the gulf-hake Urophycis mystacea, and the monkfish Lophius gastrophysus.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} relationships between seabird prey harvests and fishenes catches. These correlations have {{for the most part}} been found at scales from 10 s to 100 s of kilometers within foraging ranges around seabird breeding colonies. In the present study, we investigated associations between the prey harvests of northern gannets Sula bassana at a large breeding colony off the northeast coast of Newfoundland and the catches of the inshore Newfoundland fishery at different spatial scales and time intervals. Significant correlations occurred between the seabirds' and the humans' catches of mackerel Scomber scombrus and <b>short-finned</b> <b>squid</b> <b>Illex</b> illecebrosus from 1977 through 1992. The relationships for squid were stronger over larger geographic areas than were those for mackerel. The associations for both squid and mackerel reflected abundance/availability around the colony, at a larger scale near the gannets' maximum foraging range (e. g. - 200 km), and for the entire Newfoundland region (1000 s of kilometers). These correlations were significant at August vs August and August vs annual time intervals. The gannets' landings of squid were also associated with fishery-independent, research survey indices of squid abundance over thousands of kilometers. The robustness of these relationships indicates that levels of pelagic prey harvest by seabirds can provide reliable indices of prey abundance within and outside reproductive seasons and foraging ranges around breeding colonies. Similar relationships are predicted between seabird and human fisheries that are directed at migratory 'warm-water' pelagic prey that move into cold and high latitude oceanographic regions...|$|E
40|$|The diets {{of marine}} predators are a {{potential}} {{source of information about}} range shifts in their prey. For example, the <b>short-finned</b> <b>squid</b> <b>Illex</b> argentinus, a commercially fished species on the Patagonian Shelf in the South Atlantic, has been reported in the diet of grey-headed, Thalassarche chrysostoma; black-browed, T. melanophris; and wandering, Diomedea exulans, albatrosses breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia (54 °S 28 °W) in the Southern Ocean. Tracking data suggest that these birds may feed on I. argentinus while foraging in Southern Ocean waters during their breeding season. This led to the hypothesis that I. argentinus may occur south of the Antarctic Polar Front. To test this hypothesis, we used stable isotope analyses to assess the origin of I. argentinus. We compared I. argentinus beaks from the diets of the three albatross species with beaks of cephalopod species endemic to the Patagonian Shelf and others from the Southern Ocean. Our results show that I. argentinus from the diet of albatrosses at Bird Island have ? 13 C values in the range ? 18. 77 to ? 15. 28 ‰. This is consistent with ? 13 C values for Octopus tehuelchus, a typical species from the Patagonian Shelf. In contrast, Alluroteuthis antarcticus, a Southern Ocean squid, has typically Antarctic ? 13 C in the range ? 25. 46 to ? 18. 61 ‰. This suggests that I. argentinus originated from warmer waters of the Patagonian Shelf region.

40|$|The Argentinean <b>short-finned</b> <b>squid,</b> <b>Illex</b> argentinus, is {{distributed}} along {{the shelf and}} slope in the western South Atlantic from 22 ° to 54 °S. Since 1977 catches by a local and an international fleet increased by two orders of magnitude from c. 7 000 to > 700 000 t y-l. The species {{is associated with the}} Subtropical Convergence of the Brazil and Falkland (Malvinas) Currents. Three or four stocks are identified: the summerspawning stock (SSS), the south patagonic stock (SPS), the Bonaerensis-northpatagonic stock (BNS) and the southern Brazil stock (SBS), which may be a northern continuation of the BNS. Surveys of the shelf and adjacent oceanic waters from 29 ° to 54 °S have covered most of the year. Mature and spawned specimens, and rhynchoteuthion paralarvae of I. argentinus, have been found in summer over the northern Patagonian Shelf and in winter and spring from 29 ° to 38 °S, mainly off the Río de la Plata and along southern Brazil. Evidence suggests that the SPS, which supports the major fishery, makes a spawning migration northward to the confluence of the Brazil and Falkland (Malvinas) Currents, and paralarvae are subsequently carried to the confluence. The life span of I. argentinus is c. one year. Females grow faster and reach a larger size than males, and there is evidence that within a cohort, specimens hatching in warmer conditions have higher overall growth rates. Mantle length at maturity ranges from 142 to 250 mm for males and from 195 to 330 for females. Squid from the SSS are the smallest at maturity and those from the SPS are the largest. Potential fecundity could be as high as 750 000 in the largest females if spawning is intermittent and all eggs that attain a major axis of > 0. 05 mm at first maturity undergo complete vitellogenesis and are released. Crustacea are the major prey of I. argentinus {{in the southern part of}} the species range and fish increase in importance towards the north. It is preyed on by the most abundant demersal fishes of the patagonian Shelf. Off Argentina and Uruguay Merluccius hubbsi is a major competitor with I. argentinus for Engraulis anchoita as well as being predator and prey at different ontogenetic stages. In southern Brazil it is preyed upon by various species of tuna and the serranid Polyprion americanus. Future research should focus on the biology of the early ontogenetic stages, on gene flow among stocks and on the impact of the fishery for I. argentinus on other commercial species...|$|E

A {{total number of}} 1, 262 squid {{was involved in the}} study of growth, sexual maturity, food, and various morphometrical indices associated with growth. From these squid, 400 mandibles were chosen to study with respect to the morphometry, pigmentation, and possible growth marks. [...] Monthly samples show an increase in mantle length from July through October. A decrease in the mantle length occurs in the November samples, suggesting the appearance of a younger generation or second population. It is proposed that the spawning season for this species is from December through May of the following year. The spawning ground is postulated to be in the deeper water (i. e., 200 fathoms) of the various bays, or the deep water on the adjacent continental shelf. [...] Analyses of the gastric and caecal contents indicate that fish is the main item in the diet. Cannibalism is found to be predominant in larger squid late in the inshore season. The wide variety of food items found in the alimentary canal, suggests that this squid demonstrates little selectivity in choice of prey. [...] Morphometric indices HLI, HWI, MWI are found to decrease as the animal grows, indicating the growth of this animal is faster in length than in width. Index MEI also decreases as the animal grows, indicating the rapid development of the gonad and liver in this animal during its inshore migration. The decrease in MEI differs in rate with sex beyond a mantle length of 195 mm. in that the males mature earlier. The fin configuration is maintained unchanged throughout the size range studied, and therefore is identical in growth pattern to that described elsewhere for Lolliguncula brevis. [...] The mandibles present an interesting field of future study. The growth of the mandible is isometric and detailed analysis indicates that a more valid relationship can be demonstrated between the size of the mandible and mantle length, than can be between mandible size and total body weight. The pigmentation of the wing of the lower mandible was studied by microprojection and microplanimeter and it is evident that a major change in the degree of pigmentation is correlated with an increase in mantle length, gonad weight and the advent of sexual maturity in both sexes. [...] Microrings have been found on both the lateral wall of the lower mandible and as concentric lines in the otolith. Although the number of these mandibular microrings increases with size of the mandible, and therefore with age and maturity of the squid, no pattern or cyclic nature to their groupings could be distinguished at this time...|$|E

40|$|Predation on Illex argentinus (Cephalopoda, Ommastrephidae) in {{southern}} Brazil (26 °S to 34 °S) was studied from {{its presence in}} contents of over 14 000 stomachs from 63 potential predator species including fishes, cephalopods, penguins and marine mammals. The size composition of I. argentinus in the diet of their main predators was estimated using regression equations that relate mantle length and body weight to beak size. The <b>short-finned</b> <b>squid</b> {{was found in the}} diet of 32 species and appears {{to play an important role}} in the trophic relations along the upper slope and adjacent oceanic waters, where it was found in the diet of the swordfish Xiphias gladius, the tunas Thunnus obesus, T. alalunga and T. albacares, and the wreckfish Polyprion americanus. These five species stand for more than half of the landings from the upper slope demersal and oceanic pelagic fisheries in the region. On the shelf, where the dominant squid was Loligo sanpaulensis, Illex argentinus was only occasionally found in the diet of a few neritic predators. In southern Brazil, overall predation was more intense on subadults and adults of the winter-spring spawning group on the upper slope and oceanic adjacent waters, differently from its southern range along Uruguay and Argentina waters where the <b>short-finned</b> <b>squid</b> is abundant on the shelf and is preyed upon mainly by the demersal fish assemblage...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} ommastrephid <b>squids</b> <b>Illex</b> coindetii and Todaropsis eblanae (Mollusca: Cephalopoda) {{collected}} fromtwo {{areas in}} the north-eastern Atlantic waters (north-west Spain) as hosts for larval ascaridoid nematodes was examined from November 1992 to November 1993. The morphology, morphometric growth, population dynamics and electrophoretic identi¢cation of the anisakid nematodes was described. The corre-spondence of Anisakis type I larvae recovered from both squid species within the sibling species Anisakis simplex B is con¢rmed by comparative data on morphology, morphometry, and genetic evidences. Almost all somatic structures showed progressive and continuous allometric growth corresponding with increase in worm length. Seasonal changes in parasite population levels were evident inboth sampling areas...|$|R

The species more abundant in biomass terms in these surveys are curled octopus (Eledone cirrhosa), European flying squid (Todarodes sagittatus), seven-arm octopus (Haliphron atlanticus), Northern European squid (Loligo forbesi), globose octopus (Bathypolypus sponsalis), lesser flying squid (Todaropsis eblanae), broadtail shortfin <b>squid</b> (<b>Illex</b> coindetti) and stout bobtail squid (Rossia macrosoma). Biomass, distribution and length ranges were analysed. Most of the species occur in the shallower areas, except T. sagittatus, H. atlanticus and B. sponsalis that were mainly found in the deep strata...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Argentine shortfin <b>squid</b> (<b>Illex</b> argentinus) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} commercial fish in the world. Pepsin-solubilized collagen (PSC) was isolated from squid skin and biochemical properties of PSC were studied. The yields of skin PSC was about 18. 5 % (on the dry weight basis). SDS-PAGE patterns showed that the collagen consisted of at least two different polypeptides (α 1 and α 2 chains). The peptide maps of PSC digested by pepsin were distinct from those of carp skin collagen. Denaturation temperatures, measured by melting point using circular dichroism, was 26. 5 ˚C. The results suggest that squid skin collagen has potential as a possible underutilized resource used in various fields...|$|R
