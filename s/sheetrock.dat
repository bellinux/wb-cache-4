25|$|In 1909, USG {{purchased}} the Sackett Plaster Board Company, inventor of Sackett Board, {{which was a}} panel made of multiple layers of plaster and paper. By 1917, a new manufacturing process produced boards with a single layer of plaster and paper that could be joined flush along a wall with a relatively smooth surface. Originally called Adamant Panel Board, the product became known as <b>SHEETROCK.</b>|$|E
25|$|By the 1930s, the company's {{policy of}} {{diffusion}} of manufacturing facilities, vertical integration and product diversification {{allowed it to}} operate profitably every year during the Great Depression. The 1933 Chicago World’s Fair featured buildings made almost entirely out of <b>SHEETROCK</b> panels, {{which led to the}} brand's first major advertising campaign. Following the end of World War II, the residential building market boomed with the returning GIs and the emerging tract housing projects such as Levittown.|$|E
25|$|Polk County police interviewed {{several people}} living near the farm. Paul Wilson, a factory worker, {{said that the}} blast {{shattered}} his windows and blew <b>sheetrock</b> off his ceiling. He had been told three months before by the Webbs {{that they did not}} want his children to go near the barn. Another neighbor, Howard Haulk, said he heard one large blast followed by several smaller blasts over the course of about 20 minutes. The initial blast shattered glass in the Haulks' living room.|$|E
50|$|We {{were making}} a home out of a {{crumbling}} building Street Squat. The interior of the building needed help, and we brought that building back to life. It was standing strong. And the only reason it was standing was because people were living in it. If we had let it go the way the city wanted it to go—they tore out the stairwell, they punched holes in the roof. The water—the rain was rotting that building from the inside out. We replaced the joists. We rebuilt the floors. We <b>sheetrocked</b> the walls and made the building alive. What did they do? They killed it. That building is {{over a hundred years}} old. It was standing strong.|$|R
25|$|On April 30, 2004, MB2 Motorsports {{announced}} {{a partnership with}} CENTRIX Financial, LLC, coming on as an associate sponsor for the 01 and 10 cars. In addition, the team's original number 36 would be resurrected to field a third team part-time for Road course ringer Boris Said, who had driven the 01 for two races in 2003 which included a pole at Sonoma. Centrix was scheduled to sponsor two races, debuting with a 6th-place finish at Sonoma. Centrix sponsored Said again at the oval track Auto Club Speedway, where he finished one lap down in 30th. USG <b>Sheetrock</b> (an associate on the 01) came on to sponsor two more races for Said, DNQing at Watkins Glen and finishing 28th in the season finale at Homestead after a transmission failure late in the race.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Burton won {{the pole}} for four races, {{bringing}} his {{total number of}} career pole wins to six. The four pole wins were for the Daytona 500, the USG <b>Sheetrock</b> 400 at Chicagoland Speedway, the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and the GFS Marketplace 400 at Michigan International Speedway. Prior to qualifying for the Daytona 500, Burton was extremely enthusiastic about the improvements to RCR as a whole. The Allstate 400 pole gave Richard Childress Racing the front row as teammate Clint Bowyer recorded the second fastest time. Burton's best finish came in the Chicagoland race where he recorded a second-place finish. He led the most laps at Indianapolis and Bristol's Sharpie 500, setting the pace {{for more than half}} the race. In the Busch Series, he won at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Dover International Speedway, breaking his four-year winless streak in any series. After the race at Richmond International Raceway Jeff qualified for the Chase for the Nextel Cup. During the Chase, Burton won the Dover 400 at Dover International Speedway allowing him to take the points lead. However, a series of relatively poor finishes in subsequent races, including a flat tire at Talladega while running in the top five and an engine failure at Martinsville, eliminated Burton from contention for the championship.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, the {{commission}} members shared {{a belief that}} the buildings should not reinterpret past architectural forms – as had been done at earlier fairs, such as Chicago's 1893 World's Columbian Exposition—but should instead reflect new, modern ideas, as well as suggest future architectural developments. Because the fairgrounds was on new man-made land that was owned by the state and not the city, the land was initially free from Chicago's strict building codes, which allowed the architects to explore new materials and building techniques. This allowed the design and construction of a wide array of experimental buildings, that eventually included large general exhibition halls, such as the Hall of Science (Paul Cret) and the U.S. Federal Building (Bennet, Burnham and Holabird); corporate pavilions, including the General Motors Building (Albert Kahn) and the Sears Pavilion (Nimmons, Carr, and Wright); futuristic model houses, most popular was the twelve-sided House of Tomorrow (George Frederick Keck); as well as progressive foreign pavilions,including the Italian Pavilion (Mario de Renzi and Adalberto Libera); and historic and ethnic entertainment venues, such as the Belgian Village (Burnham Brothers with Alfons deRydt) and the Streets of Paris (Andrew Rebori and John W. Root) where fan dancer Sally Rand performed. These buildings were constructed out of five-ply Douglas fir plywood, ribbed-metal siding, and prefabricated, boards, such as Masonite, <b>Sheetrock,</b> Maizewood, as well as other new man-made materials. Structural advances also filled the fairgrounds. These included the earliest catenary roof constructed in the United States, which roofed the dome of the Travel and Transport Building (Bennet, Burnham and Holabird) and the first thin shell concrete roof in the United States, on the small, multi-vaulted Brook Hill Farm Dairy built for the 1934 season of the fair.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 1950, as many as 200 men were {{involved}} in the final steps of completion of the 1950 Tacoma Narrows Bridge. [...] On July 24, workers from Roebling's Sons were involved in wrapping and caulking the suspender cable bands, and the railings on the sidewalks were being completed. By August 22, the road deck was taking shape, as workers continued concrete pours for the roadway. Painting began that week, as eleven men worked the paint crew sandblasting and painting the stiffening truss. The bridge received its first coat of [...] "Narrows Green" [...] paint - a grayish-green hue (its predecessor had been painted the same color a decade before). By September 30, workers installed the finishing touches on the toll plazas, including installing <b>sheetrock</b> and plumbing. The midspan and tower hydraulic damping mechanisms were also installed, and workers began removing the catwalks, tower buttresses, and other working platforms.|$|E

50|$|The {{moment where}} Llyod is killed from <b>sheetrock</b> fallen onto him was cut repeatedly, mostly due to Quinn's comedic {{personality}} on-set kept making Allen crack up. Quinn explained how {{they used a}} dummy for the <b>sheetrock</b> to fall, and when it fell it caused the dummy's legs to slightly fling up which made him hysterically laugh. When the <b>sheetrock</b> fell down, Allen's reaction was real as the <b>sheetrock</b> falling was very loud, almost equivalent to a gunshot. They ended up dropping it from a floor above {{with a bunch of}} sheets of fake <b>sheetrock</b> with two real ones on both sides, and Baur, accompanied with special-effects assistant Mick Strawn, practiced with it until they could drop it reliably and to make it look convincing.|$|E
50|$|To {{save time}} and money while {{building}} military bases and offices, the U.S. Government turned to the United States Gypsum corporation for a product dating from 1916 called <b>sheetrock.</b> Before the war, American homes were routinely plastered inside—a painstaking process that could consume weeks where no other trade could work inside the house. Despite the expense and labor intensity of plastering, and the successful use of <b>sheetrock</b> {{in most of the}} buildings at the Chicago’s World’s Fair of 1933-34, <b>sheetrock</b> had not caught on. But the urgencies of wartime construction changed all that (Gellner, 2003). Colonial Hills and Dales {{was one of the first}} sites in the nation to utilize <b>sheetrock</b> rather than plaster construction.|$|E
