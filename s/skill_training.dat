40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{implement}} a psychological <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> program for dancers and evaluate the dancers’ use of psychological <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> techniques, and possible effects of the course. Specifically, the present study examined: 1) to what extent the dancers were using psychological <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> techniques; 2) whether a short course in psychological <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> for dancers made any difference to their use of psychological <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> techniques; 3) whether differences existed between groups of dancers regarding year at the dance academy, previous education in psychological <b>skills</b> <b>training,</b> and attendance; 4) the dancers’ response to psychological <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> during the course. Method: 51 dancers (45 female and six male aged 18 - 26 years) at a dance academy in Sweden participated in the study. The course in psychological <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> stretched over four months with four to six lessons. A shortened version of the Test of Performance Strategies was completed by the dancers at the first and last lesson. Descriptive statistics, one-way between-groups analysis of variance (ANOVA), and paired-samples t-tests were used to analyze the data. Memoing was practised to document the dancers’ direct response to the course. Results: The dancers used self-talk, emotional control, goal setting, imagery, activation, and attentional control “sometimes” in connection with their dance practice, whereas relaxation was used “rarely”. The total score for the dancers’ use of psychological <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> techniques only showed a marginal increase between pre- and post-intervention data. The only statistically significant difference found was an increase in the scores for relaxation. No statistically significant difference was found between groups regarding total score. The results from the memoing indicated that active participation during the lessons resulted in a more positive attitude towards psychological <b>skills</b> <b>training,</b> and that the dancers used different vocabulary regarding psychological <b>skills</b> <b>training.</b> The dancers also expressed difficulties implementing psychological <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> techniques on their own outside the classroom. Conclusions: The dancers in the present study had very similar scores on the questionnaire compared to athletes in previous research. For future research it would be of interest to see if a longer psychological <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> program for dancers, or a course with higher intensity, could further facilitate the dancers’ use of psychological <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> techniques, as well as integrate psychological <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> more in their dance practice. The results from this study could provide valuable information for further development of a psychological <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> program for dancers and might serve as a guide for areas that could benefit from extra attention in order to help dancers evolve both professionally and personally...|$|R

2500|$|Pattern change {{strategies}} performed over a {{long period}} of time are used to increase the ability of those with NPD to become more empathetic in everyday relationships.

This is not so much to change their self-perception of their [...] "entitlement" [...] feeling but more to help them empathize with others. Another type of treatment would be temperament change. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy may be effective in treating NPD, but therapists must recognize the patient's traits and use caution in tearing down narcissistic defenses too quickly.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of psychosocial <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> {{for individuals with}} serious mental illness has been well-documented. However, several questions remain regarding the course of, individual variability in response to, and predictors of response to <b>skills</b> <b>training.</b> The present study investigated course patterns during psychosocial <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> in individuals with serious mental illness. Five hypotheses were tested related to (a) the course of treatment progress during <b>skills</b> <b>training,</b> (b) relations between treatment progress and microprocess variables (e. g., attention), (c) identification of patient subgroups with varying amounts and rates of progress, (d) characterization of patient subgroups using pretreatment neurocognitive and social cognitive variables, and (e) examination of outcomes associated with subgroup membership. Archival clinical data from 93 individuals with serious mental illness at an inpatient psychiatric rehabilitation program in Nebraska was used. These individuals participated in a 9 -week Medication Management <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> module developed at the University of California, Los Angeles. Results indicated that on average, participants improved {{over the course of}} <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> as assessed by a trainer-rated measure of treatment progress. There was significant inter-individual variation in progress ratings during the first week and over the course of <b>skills</b> <b>training.</b> Regarding relations with microprocess variables, treatment progress was strongly influenced by facilitating variables (attention, participation, and spontaneity). In contrast, hindering variables (withdrawal, disruption, and bizarre behavior) minimally impacted treatment progress. Three distinct treatment progress trajectories emerged: a low progress class (n = 10), a moderate progress class (n = 61), and a high progress class (n = 22). Low progress class members differed from other class members in having poorer neurocognitive functioning at admission. The groups did not differ in social cognitive functioning at admission. Finally, the three classes differed in their likelihood of completing <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> and in post-treatment psychosocial functioning. Findings suggest that there is significant heterogeneity in the rate and magnitude of change during <b>skills</b> <b>training.</b> Psychosocial <b>skills</b> <b>training</b> programs should consider this heterogeneity and tailor interventions to particular patient subpopulations for optimal effectiveness. ...|$|R
