5|$|The Ritz {{opened on}} Piccadilly on 24 May 1906. It {{was the first}} {{significant}} <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building</b> to be constructed in London, {{and is one of}} the most prestigious and best known hotels in the world.|$|E
5|$|Designed by Adrian D. Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the Franklin Center, {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous and {{recognized}} buildings in Chicago. The building's form features setbacks at the 15th, 30th and 45th floors. Designed in the postmodern architectural style, it is a granite-clad <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building</b> resting on pile foundations. The structure is characterized by strong vertical lines, spiked roof pinnacles, granite cladding and setbacks. The granite is a deep red color at the base, but changes shade to rose-beige at the top. Above the 5th floor, the lighter rose-beige granite is protected by silk-screened aluminum panels. The building relies on Gothic detailing to showcase verticality. The building's verticality evokes images of 1920s buildings, and the sturdiness of the structure is reminiscent of the Chicago Board of Trade Building. In addition to its design, the building relies on its location at the farthest corner from the Willis Tower to set it apart.|$|E
5|$|Strand {{station was}} built {{on the site of the}} Royal Strand Theatre, which had closed on 13 May 1905 and been demolished. Construction of the station began on 21 October 1905, to a design by the UERL's {{architect}} Leslie Green in the UERL house style of a two-storey <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building</b> faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The station building is L-shaped, with two façades separated by the building on the corner of Strand and Surrey Street. The Strand façade is narrow with a single semi-circular window above the entrance. The façade in Surrey Street is wider with a separate entrance and exit and a shop unit. In anticipation of a revival of the extension to Waterloo and the City route, the station was built with three circular lift shafts able to accommodate six trapezium-shaped lifts. Only one of the shafts was fitted out, with two lifts. The other two shafts rose from the lower concourse to the basement of the station, but could have been extended upwards into the space of the shop unit when required. A fourth smaller-diameter shaft accommodated an emergency spiral stair.|$|E

25|$|Work finally {{started on}} a {{replacement}} town hall in 1930 and took until 1936 to complete. The new town hall is a <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building</b> clad in grey Portland Stone and used no fewer than seven million bricks. H.R.H. The Duke of Kent opened the town hall on 28 October 1936. The building has many typical Art Deco features, but is correctly described as neoclassical {{on account of the}} contrast between the classical and modern styles.|$|E
25|$|The {{new company}} {{was larger than}} the {{facilities}} of either bank, so a new building was called for. The bank hired the architectural firm of Smith Hinchman and Grylls and their young architect Wirt C. Rowland. Rowland designed an exotic building blending Art Deco, Mayan, and Native American elements. The base of the <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building</b> is sheathed in red granite, and second and third stories are covered with yellow stone. The remainder of the building is sheathed with a custom-made dark orange brick. Terra cotta and Pewabic tile provide accents to the exterior brick.|$|E
500|$|The Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, the Earl of Ancaster, opened Billingborough County Secondary Modern School in 1963. On [...] {{of playing}} ground, {{including}} tennis courts, the <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building</b> was constructed by Messrs. Fosters of Grantham {{under the supervision}} of J. W. H. Barnes, county architect. It housed an assembly hall and dining space, gymnasium and three-storeys of classrooms alongside workshops for practical subjects. Following the closure of the Billingborough site, the buildings were demolished in 2014.|$|E

500|$|In 1926, Holden {{began the}} design of a new {{headquarters}} for the UERL at 55 Broadway above St. James's Park station. Above the first floor, the <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building</b> was constructed to a cruciform plan and rises in a series of receding stages to a central clock tower [...] tall. The arrangement maximises daylight to the building's interior without the use of light wells. Like his stations of the period and his pre-First World War commercial buildings, the block is austerely clad in Portland stone. Holden again detailed the façades with commissioned sculptures; , two compositions by Epstein, are at first floor level, and a series of eight bas-reliefs at the seventh floor represent the four winds (two for each of the cardinal directions, {{on each side of the}} projecting wings). The building is Grade I listed.|$|E
500|$|The {{station is}} in Down Street in Mayfair, just off Piccadilly {{and a short}} {{distance}} from Park Lane. It lies between Green Park (originally named Dover Street) and Hyde Park Corner on the Piccadilly line. It was opened by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP the precursor to the Piccadilly line) on 15 March 1907, {{a few months after the}} rest of the line opened. The delay was due to difficulties in purchasing the site for the station building and agreeing a safe layout of the passages below ground with the Board of Trade. The surface building was designed by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London's (UERL's) architect Leslie Green in the UERL house style of a two-storey <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building</b> faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The station had a pair of Otis lifts, with the platforms located [...] below the street level of Piccadilly.|$|E

2500|$|In 1907, {{draughtsman}} Norman Aitken Dick {{joined the}} partnership, and {{around this time}} the Glasgow office was designing {{some of its most}} prestigious and pioneering buildings, including the Alhambra Theatre Glasgow which was in the Modern Movement and an early example of a <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building</b> (which construction he employed the following year for the Kodak Building, London) [...] and the Sick Children's Hospital at Yorkhill. Burnet continued his study visits to the United States in 1908 and 1910, looking at the design of warehouses, hospitals, museums and galleries.|$|E
2500|$|The Ulmer Park Depot {{is located}} at 2449 Harway Avenue in the {{neighborhood}} of Bath Beach, Brooklyn. The depot fills the block bounded by 25th Avenue, Bay 38th Street (which is closed to the public), Harway Avenue, and Bath Avenue. Land for the depot was acquired in 1947, and the facility was constructed in the late 1940s, opening for operation on January 15, 1950. It is a single story [...] <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building</b> with a brick exterior. It was rehabilitated in 1983 and 1989. This is the only NYCTA depot in Brooklyn to maintain express buses, storing a total of 285 buses. Ulmer Park is notable for rebuilding, repairing, and housing NYCT Bus 2185, a MCI express coach which was badly damaged during the September 11 attacks in 2001.|$|E

50|$|Between 1965 and 1967, the Shell-Haus {{site was}} {{extended}} northwards {{with the construction}} of two similarly <b>steel-framed</b> <b>buildings</b> designed by the German architect Paul Baumgarten. Being comparatively conventional and unremarkable in design, they were not included under the original building’s historical monument protection and an 1995 application to rectify this was quashed.|$|R
50|$|Sven Bylander (1877-1943) was a Swedish {{engineer}} who created steel reinforced buildings, designing {{some of the}} first <b>steel-framed</b> <b>buildings</b> in London. His frames included the Ritz Hotel and Selfridges Department Store, which were two of his most memorable works. His standardization methods were instrumental in development of the LCC (General Powers) Act 1909.|$|R
2500|$|The Oregonian Building was a {{building}} in downtown Portland, Oregon, United States, which served as the headquarters of Portland's major newspaper, The Oregonian, from 1892 to 1948. [...] It was the first <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building</b> constructed in the Western U.S., and from its opening until 1911 it was the tallest building in Portland. [...] In addition to the newspaper's offices and printing press, in 1922 the building became the home of Portland's first commercial radio station, KGW-AM, which was owned by the Oregonian Publishing Company. A second radio station, KEX, was acquired by the paper in 1933, and joined KGW in new, shared studios in the Oregonian Building. [...] A fire in 1943 forced the radio stations to relocate. The company sold the building in December 1947 as it prepared for a move to a larger building. In June 1948, the newspaper {{moved to a new}} building on Southwest Broadway, also called the Oregonian Building. [...] The 1892 building with the landmark clock tower then stood vacant for about two years until it was demolished, in 1950.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distinctive}} original {{building was}} {{designed in the}} late 1960s by William Pereira {{to sit at the}} head of a canyon. The buildings arches, in combination with the design of the individual floors, is made to look like hands holding up a stack of books. William Pereira & Associates prepared a detailed [...] in 1969. Pereira originally conceived a <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building,</b> but this was changed to reinforced concrete to save on construction and maintenance costs. This change of material presented an opportunity for a more sculptural design. It was envisioned that future additions to the original building would form terraced levels around the tower base descending into the canyon. In keeping with the original master plan, these are [...] "deliberately designed to be subordinated to the strong, geometrical form of the existing library." [...] Within its two subterranean levels are the other library sections as well as study spaces and computer labs. The tower is a prime example of brutalist architecture. It rises 8 stories to a height of 110ft (33.5m). The five upper stories of the tower house collections, individual study space, and group study rooms.|$|E
2500|$|This era {{also saw}} a {{transformation}} in Brighton's leisure and entertainment venues as it continued to flourish as a popular resort. [...] Many large cinemas, theatres and dance halls were built, some in the fashionable Art Deco style: among them were the Savoy, the Astoria, the Regent, the Imperial Theatre and Sherry's Dance Hall—which was near another [...] "much-loved venue", the SS Brighton complex. [...] Also in the Art Deco style were the Saltdean Lido and another open-air swimming pool at Black Rock. [...] Older buildings given a new look included the Brighton Dome (originally the Royal Pavilion's stables, built by William Porden) and the Brighton Aquarium. Local architect John Leopold Denman designed many new buildings, typically in a [...] "well-mannered and individual" [...] Neo-Georgian style: most were for commercial use, such as 20–22 Marlborough Place, Regent House and the offices for the Brighton & Hove Herald newspaper at 2–3 Pavilion Buildings, but the Hounsom Memorial Church at Hangleton and the Downs Crematorium are also his. [...] The latter may {{have been inspired by}} Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel's St Wilfrid's Church on nearby Elm Grove. Goodhart-Rendel, a native of Brighton, also produced [...] "his own inimitable response to Modernism" [...] at Princes House, a <b>steel-framed</b> <b>building</b> with red and blue patterned brickwork. [...] Several of its neighbouring commercial buildings on North Street are by Denman or the Clayton & Black firm.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} was constructed by Mitchell and King Ltd in 1926 and its construction was supervised by Atkins and Mitchell.
