The LPC 81 xM support up to 16 kB of flash memory and 4 kB of SRAM. The peripheral complement of the LPC 81 xM includes a CRC engine, one I 2 C-bus interface, up to three USARTs, up to two SPI interfaces, one multi-rate <b>timer,</b> <b>self</b> wake-up <b>timer,</b> and state-configurable timer, one comparator, function-configurable I/O ports through a switch matrix, an input pattern match engine, and up to 18 general-purpose I/O pins. 2.

50|$|There is a <b>self</b> <b>timer,</b> flash, autofocus, ISO range, {{and film}} rewind. The ISO range {{is a black}} slider {{on the bottom of}} the camera.|$|E
50|$|The Zorki 2 (1954) {{was similar}} to the Zorki but {{featured}} an updated rewind mechanism, a <b>self</b> <b>timer</b> and strap lugs. There was a later flash version called the Zorki 2S.|$|E
50|$|<b>Self</b> <b>Timer</b> {{would be}} the ideal method but {{unfortunately}} the Pentax K-x HDR feature cannot be used with the camera's selftimer as it is not enabled in Firmware 1.01 and 1.02 for reasons unknown.|$|E
50|$|A <b>self</b> <b>timer</b> is {{a device}} on a camera {{that gives a}} delay between {{pressing}} the shutter release and the shutter's firing. It is most commonly used to let photographers to take a photo of themselves (often with family), hence the name.|$|E
50|$|A tripod {{is usually}} {{necessary}} {{due to the}} long exposure times involved. Alternatively, the camera may be placed on or braced against a table or other solid support. A shutter release cable or <b>self</b> <b>timer</b> is generally employed {{in order to minimize}} camera shake.|$|E
50|$|The FED 2 is a {{new design}} that is quite {{different}} from the FED 1. It has a longer rangefinder base (67 mm), a combined viewfinder and rangefinder window, adjustable diopter for the viewing window, a <b>self</b> <b>timer,</b> and a detachable back for film loading.|$|E

50|$|The Zorki 4 is {{basically}} a Zorki 3S with a <b>self</b> <b>timer.</b> It retained all of the features and strong points of the 3S. The early bodies have a vulcanite body covering, engraved shutter speeds, and strap lugs. Later bodies have fabric covering and the shutter speeds (1/60 and 1/30 instead of 1/50 and 1/25) are silk-screened. By the mid-1960s, the strap lugs had disappeared.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the digital}} camera era, some users {{continue}} {{to refer to}} continuous shooting modes as [...] "motor drive". Many camera models refer to different shooting modes - single shot, burst, continuous, <b>self</b> <b>timer</b> - as drive modes, thus keeping alive the terminology of film. An external battery grip is occasionally {{referred to as a}} motor drive as it tends to increase the frame rate.|$|E
50|$|Except {{for having}} an {{enormous}} variety of lenses {{with the popular}} K mount to choose from, the K1000 has fewer features compared to higher-level SLRs of the mid 1970s. The camera has a flash synchronization speed of 1/60th second, a sleeve-bushing equipped shutter and film advance mechanism, no <b>self</b> <b>timer,</b> no depth-of-field preview, no mirror lockup, no interchangeable focusing screens, no motor drive option, and no autoexposure. The K1000 is a completely manual camera.|$|E
50|$|Mirror lock-up {{involves}} {{flipping the}} mirror up {{well before the}} shutter opens, allowing the vibrations to die down before exposing the film. On some cameras MLU may be operated by an extra push of the shutter button, the second push resulting in the actual opening of the shutter. Other arrangements may involve an extra lever or button that flips the mirror up before using the shutter release button normally. On some cameras MLU is not a separate feature, but operated {{as part of the}} <b>self</b> <b>timer</b> (notably the Nikon FE line of cameras).|$|E
50|$|The XG-9's {{integrated}} switch for on/off/self-timer/battery {{check was}} removed and its functions {{spread around the}} camera. The <b>self</b> <b>timer</b> was relocated to a switch {{on the front of}} the camera, on the left-hand side of the mirror housing. A new main on-off switch was placed beneath the shutter speed dial. The lock button for the shutter speed dial also functioned as a battery check; the front LED, also used for the self-timer, lit when that button was pressed and the batteries held adequate charge. Film speed and exposure compensation settings were moved to beneath the rewind knob.|$|E

30|$|Over the years, energy {{efficiency}} {{is regarded as}} one of the critical design issues in WSN. To achieve {{energy efficiency}}, many Power Conservation Mechanisms (PCMs) have been proposed [9, 10]. Research by Nikolaos [11] gives a comprehensive survey of different energy conservation protocols. It divided PCMs into two main types: active and passive. Active schemes enhance energy efficiency at protocol level (MAC, network, and transport layers). Passive schemes on the other hand rely on energy aware hardware, for example, low power radio and processor [12 â€“ 15]. When nodes are idle, they go into low power sleep mode (turn off their transceiver) and wakeup (turn on their transceiver) using <b>self</b> <b>timer.</b> Depending upon the decision when to turn on or off the transceiver, the PCM schemes are divided into two categories [11]: fine grain and coarse grain schemes. In fine grain schemes, node turn off their transceiver for one transmission frame, when there is no frame destined to that node. Power-aware multi-access with signaling (PAMAS) [16] is an example of fine grained scheme. In PAMAS, when a node is receiving data from any other node; it sends a busy tone on its control channel to tell the neighbor node when to turn off. A sensor node turns off its transceiver when it does not have data to send and its neighbor starts communication with other nodes. Contrary to this, in the coarse-grain power conservation mechanism, the decision when to turn on or turn off the transceiver is done by a dedicated service above the MAC layer [9]. Coarse-grain mechanism is further divided into two categories: distributed and backbone-based. In the distributed mechanism, the decision when to turn on or turn off the transceiver is taken by the node itself considering its local information and sleeping schedule information of its neighbor. S-MAC [17] is an example of distributed coarse-grain passive protocol and is one of the first MAC layers designed to reduce power consumption in WSNs. In S-MAC, nodes are randomly turned on and turned off to save energy consumption. Traffic destined for these randomly sleeping nodes is temporarily stored by the neighbors, who are active. Sleeping nodes after periodic intervals wake up and receive/save their data from their neighbors. S-MAC enhances energy efficiency to a great extent at the cost of increased delay. In the backbone-based approach, the power conservation module lies at the backbone node. These backbone nodes act as coordinators, do the synchronization of sleeping schedules and also act as proxy for the sleeping sensor nodes. SPAN [18] is an example of a backbone-based coarse-grain conservation scheme, where each node makes local decision to go into sleep or join backbone, based on its own energy and estimation that how many of its neighbor will benefit from it being awake. In Ref. [19], a scheme based on cross layer design virtual back bone is formed using clustering.|$|E
