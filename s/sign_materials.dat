A design goal of Clearview was the reduction of irradiation effects of retroreflective <b>sign</b> <b>materials.</b> Reduced nighttime overglow or haloing was expected also to improve recognition rates for computer road sign detection. Unfortunately, these tests compared new signs in Clearview to existing, weathered signs in the existing Highway Gothic font. The new font's apparent legibility [...] "was more {{due to the fact}} that older, worn signs were being replaced with nice, fresh, clean signs which were, naturally, more legible." [...] Better testing also revealed that legibility was worse for negative contrast signs (dark lettering on light backgrounds) such as on speed limit and yellow warning signs.|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to recent findings in cognitive linguistics, the paper {{sums up the}} principles of ‘corporeal pragmatics’ {{as they have been}} developed so far. At the centre of the author’s perceptually oriented investigation of natural language stands the relation between natural language and perception. The paper charges the philosophy of language and linguistics with having for too long committed the sin of Wahrnehmungsvergessenheit, the forgetting of taking for ‘true’ what our senses tell us. The author proposes to redress this imbalance by an argument that linguistic meaning events rely essentially on the activation of empty linguistic schemata by conceptually regulated, iconic <b>sign</b> <b>materials.</b> Such a claim requires a redefinition of the Saussurean signified, the concept, reference and deixis and other terms in the vocabulary of the study of language. The paper concludes by suggesting that corporeal pragmatics has serious implications for disciplines well beyond philosophy, semiotics, and linguistics...|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of an {{extensive}} literature survey {{on the state of the}} art practices in providing urban guide signing. The topics researched include, traffic management issues, system design, <b>sign</b> <b>materials,</b> and a focus on driver information processing abilities and their effect on sign design requirements. The guidance needs of drivers differ according to their knowledge of the route to their destination. Drivers may be classified as a &quot;stranger &quot; who is driving to a destination for the first time and is unfamiliar with the area, &quot;local-stranger &quot; who is broadly familiar with the area but not with the route or a &quot;local-local &quot; driver who is repeating a regular trip. It is the first two categories of driver who are most dependent on good guide signing. Guide signs provide information to drivers for the selection of roads, locating of offroute facilities and identifying other points of interest. Guide signs in the urban area have a role in traffic management plans. The principle goal of traffic management is minimizing congestion. The role of guide signs is to direct drivers to the routes that best serve their needs. Drivers seeking to pass through the urban area are directed to routes that have a high capacity and minimal acces...|$|E

We describe a potential sonographic pitfall, the “pseudo gallbladder, ” in biliary atresia (BA). Objective To describe the Pseudo Gallbladder sign (PsGB <b>sign).</b> <b>Materials</b> and methods Sonograms/clinical records of 20 confirmed BA infants and 20 non-BA cases were reviewed retrospectively. For the BA group, preoperative sonography and surgical and pathological findings were examined. For the non-BA group, sonographic features and pathological findings were examined. The PsGB sign {{is defined as a}} fluid-filled structure, located in the expected region of the gallbladder, measuring ≤ 15 mm in length but without a well-defined or normal-appearing gallbladder wall. Results A recognizable gallbladder and normal gallbladder wall were present in all non-BA infants. However, none of the BA infants had a sonographically normal gallbladder. Seventy-three percent of BA patients had a PsGB, and in 27 % no gallbladder or gallbladder-like structure was detected.

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{describes the}} first phase of the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) fluorescent orange sign sheeting evaluation. The general goal of the evaluation was to develop a reasonable list of approved fluorescent orange sign sheeting products while ensuring the approved products will function adequately for the intended purpose. The evaluation used a human factors type test with an expert panel of test subjects. The evaluation resulted in the conditional approval of three fluorescent orange prismatic sign sheeting materials for use on rigid/semi-rigid substrate materials and four prismatic roll-up <b>sign</b> <b>materials.</b> The approval of the materials is conditional, pending a follow-up evaluation after one year of outdoor exposure. BACKGROUND A recent Arizona Transportation Research Center study (1) indicates that 3 % of all reported accidents occur in work zones. The study also indicates that work zone accidents on the Arizona state system are over-represented when compared to all accidents statewide. While this study did not recommend any specific counter measures related to the type of work zone signing, it is obvious that advance signing is the first line of defense for warning and directing traffic safely through the work zone. It is also widely held that conspicuity of the warning sign is an important factor in driver recognition of warning signs. Hummer and Scheffler (2) found fluorescent orange signs in work zone...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether a proximal (M 1 -segment) or distal (M 2 - and/or M 3 -segment) hyperattenuating middle cerebral artery (MCA) sign in patients with ischemic infarction in {{the territory of the}} MCA indicates a worse short-term prognosis than that in patients without a hyperattenuating MCA <b>sign.</b> <b>MATERIALS</b> AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 352 patients who were diagnosed with ischemic brain infarction in the territory of the MCA. Of these patients, 186 patients met our final criteria and were included in this study. Nonenhanced computed tomography (CT) was performed for the entire brain, with a 5 -mm section thickness in all patients, within 24 hours after symptom onset. The presence and location of a hyperattenuating MCA sign was correlated with neurologic deficit at discharge from the hospital (ie, short-term prognosis) by using the chi(2) test to detect differences between patient groups. RESULTS: Patients with a hyperattenuating MCA sign at CT have a worse short-term prognosis than do patients without a hyperattenuating MCA sign (P <. 05). Patients with a proximal hyperattenuating MCA sign have a significantly (P <. 01) worse short-term prognosis than do patients with a distal hyperattenuating MCA sign. CONCLUSION: A proximal hyperattenuating MCA sign is a reliable predictor of poor short-term prognosis in patients who experience acute strok...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} clinical, radiographic, and {{intraoperative}} signs that alert clinicians {{to the presence}} or absence of pathologic changes. Although arthroscopy is best performed in an organized, methodical fashion, intra-articular injuries can be missed. Undetected injuries can significantly negate the surgeon’s ability to relieve the pain or other symptoms that initiated surgical consultation. The meniscal flounce is a fold in the free, nonanchored inner edge of the medial meniscus 3, 7, 9 (Figure 1). Its pres-ence is thought to be predictive of an intact meniscus. 7 Whereas the presence of a flounce has been described as being a normal arthroscopic finding, no mention in the lit-erature has been given to the significance of absence of the flounce. To our knowledge, no study has correlated {{the presence or absence}} of a flounce to {{the presence or absence of}} medial meniscus tears. We hypothesized that meniscal flounce sign can be a significant indicator of the presence or absence of medial meniscus tears. We therefore under-took a prospective study to evaluate the meniscal flounce <b>sign.</b> <b>MATERIALS</b> AND METHODS One hundred sixty-eight consecutive patients undergoing arthroscopy by the senior author (R. W. W.) were evaluated prospectively using a data collection sheet for the presence or absence of the arthroscopic meniscal flounce sign as well as associated intra-articular injuries. There were 105 men and 63 women in the study. Mean age was 41 years. All arthroscopies were performed between May 2001 and April 2002. The operating surgeon was not blinded to the preop-erative history, physical examination results, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. All arthroscopic procedures were performed using a leg holder. Inflow was accomplished via a superomedial portal, and visualization of the medial compartment, including the meniscus, was done from the standard anterolateral portal. During diagnostic evaluation of the medial compartment...|$|E

40|$|As the new {{millennium}} approaches, <b>signing</b> and marking <b>materials</b> continue to evolve. Recent efforts to increase {{the safety of the}} motoring public include the use of improved delineation materials. PERFORMANCE If the current and future state of the art for <b>signing</b> and marking <b>materials</b> could be summarized in one word, that word would be performance. Quantifiable material performance requirements are relatively new to this industry, which is more than 70 years old. In the {{new millennium}}, performance of <b>signing</b> and marking <b>materials</b> will be measured day and night, and during clear and inclement weather. Improved <b>signing</b> and marking <b>materials</b> will be part of some new Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) initiatives; development is already under way in the ITS arena. Sign performance will be measured by its durability and utility (that is, how easily it is viewed by motorists) in real situations. New marking and <b>signing</b> <b>materials</b> to improve roadway delineation are currently under evaluation. Improvements The use of durable marking materials instead of standard paint and beads has increased recently. Because maintenance funds continue to be squeezed, this trend will extend into {{the new millennium}}. One new concept under development is pavement marking management systems, which allow choice of pavement-marking materials on the basis of field performance and optimal use. Some agencies have moved away from in-house striping to contractors whose materials must meet specified performance criteria. Additionally, at least 10 state departments of transportation require a minimum retroreflective performance on markings newly applied by contractors. Some initial attempts have been made at warrantee contracts for pavement markings, which hold the contractor responsible for the long-term retroreflective performance of the installed material. The Pavement Marking Committee of the American Traffic Safety Services Association is developing a generic warrantee application specification to help agencies develop their own requirements. This generic specification should be finalized by the Pavement Marking Committee’s first meeting in the new millennium...|$|R
40|$|The aim {{for this}} article is to outline a {{typology}} of iconicity in verse, ranging from Form miming form to Meaning miming form/meaning. Verse here means the occurrence of rhythmical devices, such as meter, and the division into lines and stanzas. As a starting point, the different possible appearances of 'representamens' in mainly twentieth-century poetry will be discussed, following Elleström's (2010) distinction between visual <b>material</b> <b>signs,</b> auditory <b>material</b> <b>signs</b> and complex cognitive signs. In the article, verse is explored as a sensorically complex, mixed medium, because its 'representamens' frequently depend on both visual and auditory traits. Furthermore, it is important to stress that verse can be "form" in a phenomenological, sensorial sense, as well as more complex meaning. For example, the iconic sign in question could be based on the reader's awareness and identification of a certain stanzaic or metrical form and some of the acquired associations that comes with it. The contention is that iconicity in verse does not necessarily only stand for 'objects' which are already present due to symbolic signs...|$|R
