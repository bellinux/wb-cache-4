500|$|Nursehounds are {{generally}} harmless to humans. However, 19th-century British naturalist Jonathan Couch noted that [...] "although not so formidable with its teeth {{as many other}} sharks, this fish is well able to defend itself from an enemy. When seized it throws its body round the arm that holds it, and by a contractile and reversed action of its body grates {{over the surface of}} its enemy with the rugged spines of its <b>skin,</b> <b>like</b> a rasp. There are few animals that can bear so severe an infliction, by which their surface is torn with lacerated wounds."

500|$|A {{pamphlet}} titled [...] "The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick", produced c.1884 {{to accompany}} his exhibition, {{states that he}} started to display symptoms at approximately five years of age, with [...] "thick lumpy <b>skin</b> ... <b>like</b> that of an elephant, and almost the same colour". According to a 1930 article in the Illustrated Leicester Chronicle, he began to develop swellings on his lips {{at the age of}} 21months, followed by a bony lump on his forehead and a loosening and roughening of the skin. As he grew, a noticeable difference between the size of his left and right arms appeared and both his feet became significantly enlarged. The Merrick family explained his symptoms as the result of Mary's being knocked over and frightened by a fairground elephant while she was pregnant with Joseph. The concept of maternal impression—that the emotional experiences of pregnant women could have lasting physical effect on their unborn children—was still common in 19th century Britain. Merrick held this belief about the cause of his affliction for his entire life.|$|E

Ramsley Isler of IGN said the giant testes jokes were [...] "brilliantly ludicrous", and did not grow old despite running throughout {{the length of the}} episode. Isler praised the ending scene with the scrotum skin coat, and said when Cartman snorted chicken <b>skin</b> <b>like</b> cocaine, [...] "the episode reached a whole new level [...] hilarity". TV Fanatic declared the episode [...] "perfection" [...] and felt it was an improvement over the previous fourteenth season episodes [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] and [...] "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs". The site also praised the episode for use gross-out comedy like enlarged testicles for social satire as well as humor.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} primate {{ancestors of}} modern humans most likely had light <b>skin,</b> <b>like</b> our closest modern relative – the chimpanzee. [...] About 7 {{million years ago}} human and chimpanzee lineages diverged, and between 4.5 and 2 million years ago early humans moved out of rainforests to the savannas of East Africa. They not only {{had to cope with}} more intense sunlight but had to develop a better cooling system. It was harder to get food in the hot savannas and as mammalian brains are prone to overheating – 5 or 6°C rise in temperature can lead to heatstroke – so there was a need for the development of better heat regulation. The solution was sweating and loss of body hair.|$|E

[...] The crew's final visual effects shot was the death of the demon, and they researched previous films and terminology for how demons' deaths have been designed. They drew inspiration from Hellboy (2004) where they focused on the buildup to the demon's death. Clark said, [...] "We built it over a series of shots so it doesn't just happen in one shot. We had little patches on the demon that start to crack and result in a glow that looks like it's burning from within." ...|$|E
