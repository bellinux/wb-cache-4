5000|$|A {{security}} bag is a {{heavy duty}} bag used to contain high-value products or documents or legally sensitive items. Envelopes with security features are called security envelopes as well as <b>security</b> <b>bags.</b> When used to contain items related to a crime, special evidence bags are used. Authentication of signatures and chain of custody are often required.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Security</b> <b>bags</b> or {{envelopes}} may be {{specially designed}} plastic bags, paper bags, or fabric bags. Bags or envelopes {{can be made}} to be tamper resistant (TR); to make it difficult for unauthorized entry. Often it is more important for them to be tamper-evident (TE); to indicate when an unauthorized entry has occurred. No one security feature can be considered as [...] "tamper proof". [...] Layers of TR and TE features, as well as the broader security systems are needed to provide better assurance of security.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{the museum}} is open to free admission, though {{visitors}} must show identification and consent to any <b>security</b> <b>bag</b> checks. The museum is accessible by Line 1 of the Beijing Subway at the Military Museum Station and city bus routes 1, 4, 21, 65, 68, 205, 308, 320, 337, 617, 728, and 802.|$|R

It documents the unique practice and evidence-based approach to designing out opportunities for crime developed at the Centre. It demonstrates how research techniques that encompass an understanding of the innovative nature of criminal activity can be used to predict and eliminate potential risk. The paper includes reference to work undertaken in areas such as burglary and home <b>security,</b> <b>bag</b> theft and assault...|$|R

50|$|After {{the bombings}} {{that took place}} during the 2013 Boston Marathon, killing three and {{injuring}} over 260, police vowed to install additional <b>security</b> measures—including <b>bag</b> checks and additional barriers—while maintaining a friendly, happy atmosphere. Police banned backpacks, strollers, suitcases, glass containers, some costumes and props, weight vests, and items larger than 5 x 5 in. More than 3,500 uniformed Boston Police officers were present for security.|$|R
50|$|Bags {{are also}} made with {{carrying}} handles, hanging holes, tape attachments, or <b>security</b> features. Some <b>bags</b> have provisions for easy and controlled opening. Reclosable features, including press-to-seal zipper strips, are common for kitchen bags bought empty {{and for some}} foods. Some bags are sealed for tamper-evident capability, including some where the press-to-reseal feature becomes accessible only when a perforated outer seal is torn away.|$|R
50|$|The 2016 CES {{was held}} January 6-9, 2016 in Las Vegas and 3,600 {{companies}} attended; the CES 2016 venues of the Las Vegas Convention Center, the Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino and the Sands Expo & Convention Center had over 2.4 {{million square feet}} utilized for the event. The 2016 event had notably more <b>security</b> with full <b>bag</b> searches and police officers in armored gear and explosives detection dogs.|$|R
50|$|Normally {{entry for}} {{visitors}} to the ITU was by prior invitation only for security reasons; a person wishing to enter the site as a visitor {{will be required to}} hand over their passport, before passing through a combined metal and radiation detector. The details of the devices used to test visitors for radioactive and nuclear materials are not public knowledge (for security reasons). Also on entry visitors are subject to a search by a <b>security</b> officer. All <b>bags</b> are examined using an x-ray machine similar to that used in an airport.|$|R
50|$|The nun Alba Martínez, {{who led the}} convent, was {{declared}} incompetent to testify at trial by the judge. Aged 95, she suffers cognitive impairment and moderate dementia, {{and may not be}} able to answer questions with veracity. The prosecutor Federico Delgado will not appeal the ruling. Rafecas also declared the nun Inés Aparicio (who appears in the <b>security</b> tapes carrying <b>bags</b> into the convent) to be innocent, as she claimed that she thought that the bags contained food for welfare purposes. Prosecutors Delgado and Moldes do not trust her, and asked for her indictment.|$|R
5000|$|Post September 11, 2001, {{majority}} of airports {{around the world}} began to implement baggage screening directly into BHS. These systems {{are referred to as}} [...] "Checked Baggage Inspection System" [...] by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in the USA, where baggage are fed directly into Explosive Detection System (EDS) machines. A CBIS can sort baggage based on each <b>bag's</b> <b>security</b> status assigned by an EDS machine or by a security screening operator. CBIS design standards and guidelines are issued by the TSA once every year since 2008. All CBIS built in the USA must comply with the standard set forth by the TSA. The latest standards can be downloaded from the TSA's website here.|$|R
5000|$|At a May 25, 2014 {{handshake}} {{event at}} the Iwate Industry Culture and Convention Center in Takizawa, Iwate, group members Rina Kawaei, Anna Iriyama and a staff member were attacked by a 24-year-old man with a handsaw. The suspect was arrested for attempted murder, and the three were treated at a hospital for fractures and cuts. AKB48 canceled its theater performances {{through the end of}} May, and handshake and photo-shoot fan events in May and June were postponed. In response to security concerns, the Manseibashi Police Station of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department asked AKS to conduct security checks of audience members at the theater entrance. Although sister groups SKE48, NMB48 and HKT48 did not suspend their theater performances, they introduced security measures: metal detectors, not using the theaters' front rows, suspending post-performance [...] "high-five" [...] events and increasing the number of security guards. On May 30 AKB48 resumed its television appearances, and on June 2 the group resumed theater performances with security measures similar to those of its sister groups. <b>Security</b> and <b>bag</b> checks were added at the general-election-results event and Yuko Oshima's graduation concert.|$|R
40|$|The {{scheduling}} or autonomous {{planning is}} one of the areas of artificial intelligence (IA), which develops the process to define the sequence of actions to achieve the objectives established through computational methods. Through an initiative of the ESA (European Space Agency) emerges the SPASS (Software Product Assurance for Autonomy Spacecraft on-board), a project that resulted in a job that recommends extensive testing and use of simulation techniques, with application of two software components, the plausibility checker and <b>bag</b> <b>security,</b> proposed by (Blanquart, 2004). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show a theoretical approach to implemente a plausibility checker and safety bag as described by (Blanquart, 2004). According to the recommendations proposed in the work "Software Safety Supervision On-board Autonomous Spacecraft " (Blanquart, 2004) two generic software components are defined: • Plausibility checker The plausibility checker is a software component responsible for supporting the validation of plans in ground stations before they are sent to systems in space environment, as shown i...|$|R
