Pressure is fed into a cylinder via the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>hole</b> and the flow, which represents any leakage from the cylinder, is measured.

50|$|Starting fluid is sprayed {{into the}} engine intake near the air filter, {{or into the}} {{carburetor}} bore or a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>hole</b> of an engine to get added fuel to the combustion cylinder quickly. Using starting fluid to get the engine running faster avoids wear to starters and fatigue to one's arm with pull start engines, especially on rarely used machines. Other uses include cold weather starting, vehicles that run out of fuel and thus require extra time to restore fuel pressure, and sometimes with flooded engines. Mechanics sometimes use it to diagnose starting problems by determining whether the spark and ignition system of the vehicle is functioning; if the spark is adequate but the fuel delivery system is not, the engine will run until the starting fluid vapors are consumed. It is used more often with carbureted engines than with fuel injection systems. Caution is required when using starting fluid with diesel engines that have preheat systems in the intake or glow-plugs installed, as the starting fluid may pre-ignite, leading to engine damage.|$|E

In this context, an engine using compressed air might very well prove to be an effective solution. In the present study, a 4 stroke engine was modified to run on compressed air and a specially designed “articulated connecting rod” has been used, which has the provision of dwelling at the top dead center. This would make the injection of compressed air a constant volume process inside the cylinder contrary to conventional engines. In the proposed design, compressed air was supplied through a distribution system in time sequence into separate cylinders of the engine by solenoid-actuated valves located in <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>holes.</b> A valve actuator, which modified the time interval over which compressed air was admitted into the cylinder, in accordance with engine speed, was also incorporated.

50|$|Laser {{technology}} adds useful {{tools to}} improve engine design during engine testing. Lasers sensors using laser Doppler velocimetry with magnifying LDV sensors can record {{the movements of}} gas particles during the entire 2-stroke, 4-stroke or rotary combustion cycle. These spark plug velocimeter (SPV) sensors can be inserted into the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>hole</b> of the combustion chamber of the engine. The sensors can be adjusted to all depth levels of the pistons movement - typically ranging from 0 - 50mm.The magnifying LDV sensors will record the velocity {{and direction of the}} movement of gas particles. Engine design can then be optimised with the recorded data and the visualisation of the combustion cycle. The flow and direction of the gas particles can be improved by changing shape and sizes of the chamber, valves, spark plug, injectors and pistons resulting in improved combustion and performance and in reduced emissions.Engine heads with two spark plug holes per cylinder can be used to record the velocity and direction of the movement of gas particles in an engine running under live, firing conditions.SPVs can also be added to the intake and the exhaust to record flow of particles in these areas to further improve engine design.Magnifying LDV sensors have been used in even more extreme situations to measure particle flow in rocket engines.|$|E

40|$|Rotary engines offer {{higher power}} density, fewer parts and lower {{vibrations}} than conventional reciprocating piston engines. However, rotary engines {{are more difficult}} to seal because of the rotor shape which leads to higher gas leakage and oil consumption resulting in lower efficiency and higher emissions. In order to address this problem, this thesis presents a set of multiscale models to assess rotary engine performances by estimating gas leakage, oil consumption, wear and friction. An oil seal multiscale model is developed to estimate internal oil consumption guided by oil transport visualization experiments carried using a laser-induced fluorescence technique. A finite element beam model is used to predict the clearance between the oil seals and the side housing for each crank angle in the cycle. From seal-housing clearance, oil transport through the oil seals is calculated using a control volume approach. The main mechanism leading to internal oil consumption is outward scraping of the oil seals due to a lack in conformability of the seals to the distorted side housing, especially next to the intake and exhaust ports. A set of multiscale models are developed for the performance of the apex and side seals. The models are formulated to couple gas flow to the dynamics and deformation of the seals while accurately describing the interfaces between the seals and their profile and groove. The models are used to predict apex and side seal behavior and understand the mechanisms leading to gas leakage. The main leakage mechanisms identified are leakage through (1) the corner seal clearance, (2) the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>holes,</b> (3) the flanks of the seals at high speed, and (4) the side piece corner for the apex seals and at the ends of the side seals. The apex seal model shows good agreement with experiments, especially for the pressure in the apex seal groove. It is the first time such comprehensive models are developed for rotary engines and they will be valuable tools to help design more efficient and environment-friendly rotary engines. by Mathieu Picard.

2500|$|Problems arose during {{research}} in the 1950s and 1960s. For a while, engineers were faced with what they called [...] "chatter marks" [...] and [...] "devil's scratch" [...] in the inner epitrochoid surface. They discovered that the cause was the apex seals reaching a resonating vibration, and the problem was solved by reducing the thickness and weight of apex seals. Scratches disappeared after the introduction of more compatible materials for seals and housing coatings. Another early problem was the build-up of cracks in the stator surface near the <b>plug</b> <b>hole,</b> which was eliminated by installing the <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> in a separate metal insert/ copper sleeve in the housing, instead of plug being screwed directly into the block housing. Toyota found that substituting a glow-plug for the leading site <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> improved low rpm, part load, specific fuel consumption by 7%, and also emissions and idle.

Operating a spark ignition engine on an overall lean charge has tile potential to simultaneously reduce exhaust emissions and maintain good thermal efficiency. However, problems associated with ignition of the lean mixture to increased exhaust emissions and reduced thermal efficiency. Stratified charge engines offer the potential to overcome these ignition problems, and restore thermal efficiency and reduce exhaust emissions. The stratified charge combustion process developed was centred around the separate injection of methane and air into a pre-chamber, located in an auxiliary <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>hole</b> in the cylinder head, to form an easily ignitable mixture which would establish a flame which would propagate through a lean mixture located in the main combustion chamber. Timing and duration of the injected methane was controlled electronically, whereas the air introduced into the pre-chamber was controlled by a metering valve and a check valve connected to the pre-chamber. The main charge to the engine was formed by using a gas carburettor...|$|E

40|$|A spectroscopic {{diagnostic}} {{system has been}} designed to study the effects of different engine parameters on the chemiluminescence characteristic of HCCI combustion. Light emitted during the combustion process was collected by an optical fiber installed in the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> <b>hole.</b> An imaging spectrograph separated the light into the component wavelength and a high speed CCD camera captured the resulting light spectrum. The engine parameters studied in this work were intake temperature, fuel delivery method, fueling rate, air-fuel ratio, and intake charge preheating. Two different fuels were used in this experiment: pure isooctane and a primary reference fuel blend with an octane number of 87 (PRF 87). At each data point, a set of time-resolved chemiluminescence spectra were obtained, along with the cylinder pressure and exhaust emissions data. Based on the results, it was determined that different engine parameters affect the start of ignition timing in HCCI combustion without altering the reaction pathways of the fuel. The thermal history of the air-fuel mixture greatly affects the ignition timing. However, once the ignition starts, the fuel follows the same reaction pathways and produces the same intermediate species regardless of the thermal history of the mixture. The chemiluminescence spectra of HCCI combustion appear as several distinct peaks corresponding to emissions from CHO, CH 2 O, CH, and OH superimposed on top of a CO-O continuum. A strong correlation was found between the chemiluminescence light intensity and the rate of heat release. At the lower fueling rate conditions, the light intensity was too weak for further analysis...|$|E
