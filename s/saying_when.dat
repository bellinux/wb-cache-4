On the June 20, 2013 episode of the Prospect Park version of All My Children, Opal Cortlandt tells Dimitri Marick, one of Erica's ex-husbands that Erica {{was out of town}} last seen getting on an airplane to some exotic location without <b>saying</b> <b>when</b> she would be back.|$|E
25|$|In pre-Christian times, fossils {{found on}} land were thought by Greek philosophers, {{including}} Xenophanes, Xanthus and Aristotle, to be {{evidence that the}} sea had in past ages covered the land. Their concept of vast time periods in an eternal cosmos was rejected by early Christian writers as incompatible with their belief in Creation by God. Among the church fathers, Tertullian spoke of fossils demonstrating that mountains had been overrun by water without explicitly <b>saying</b> <b>when.</b> Chrysostom and Augustine believed that fossils were the remains of animals that were killed and buried during the brief duration of the Biblical Genesis Flood, and later Martin Luther viewed fossils as having resulted from the Flood.|$|E

500|$|Sverdrup flew to Fiji, and {{was able}} to report that work had started at Nadi, Fiji on 21 November. When he {{discussed}} progress on Nandi Airport in Fiji which New Zealand had agreed to extend, Walter Nash, then New Zealand Minister of Finance, recalled Sverdrup <b>saying</b> <b>when</b> he was leaving that there was no formal agreement for payment by America. So on the back of one of his cards Sverdrup drew a cross representing the airfield, wrote [...] "£250,000" [...] and initialled it [...] "L.J.S." [...] The extension was actually estimated to cost £750,000.|$|E
500|$|Another main {{theme is}} {{regarding}} the [...] "yōkais choice". As {{agents of the}} city, the two karas represent different paths {{for the good of}} the city. The yōkai have to make a choice to support one of them. By following Eko, the humans are enslaved, and the presence of the yōkai will be imposed on them. By standing behind Otoha, the yōkai accept their lot and continue trying to live with the humans. Using the yōkai-human relationship as an analogy for human-human interaction, the team suggested people should be open and make the move, instead of passively staying in the background hoping for results. Ibira applied this to decision making, <b>saying</b> <b>when</b> faced with difficult choices, one should make a decision instead of hoping for others to make it for them.|$|E

The New York Post noted one particularly resonating statement when Beshear said, [...] "I'm a proud Democrat, but first and foremost, I'm a proud Republican, and Democrat, and mostly, American." [...] The criticism extended to Beshear's choice of backdrop [...] "people sitting behind him, near motionless, in a dimly lit diner" [...] – which comedian Stephen Colbert described as your [...] "normal, relatable everyday diner where everyone faces the same direction in terrified silence." [...] Emanuel Cleaver, a Democratic congressman from Missouri concluded, [...] "I don't mind <b>saying</b> <b>when</b> we make mistakes. And [...] was a mistake." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Criminal" [...] {{was written}} in 2008 by Max Martin, Shellback and Tiffany Amber, and was {{produced}} by Martin and Shellback. Spears told MTV News that after she first listened to the song, she felt it was different and unlike anything she had heard before. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Spears spoke about Martin's productions on Femme Fatale, saying, [...] "Max played a huge role on this album {{and he has been}} there since the beginning so there is such a huge level of trust. He gets exactly what I am <b>saying</b> <b>when</b> I tell him what I want and don’t want musically". Spears recorded her vocals at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The track was later mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. It was registered on Broadcast Music Incorporated under the legal title [...] "In Love With a Criminal". On March 2, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account a link to a 17-second clip of the song, describing it as [...] "one of [...] favorites".|$|E
500|$|Cage {{underwent}} {{an artistic}} {{crisis in the}} early 1940s. His compositions were rarely accepted by the public, and he grew more and more disillusioned {{with the idea of}} art as communication. He later gave an account of the reasons: [...] "Frequently I misunderstood what another composer was saying simply because I had little understanding of his language. And I found other people misunderstanding what I myself was <b>saying</b> <b>when</b> I was saying something pointed and direct". At the beginning of 1946, Cage met Gita Sarabhai, an Indian musician who came to the United States concerned about Western influence on the music of her country. Sarabhai wanted to spend several months in the US, studying Western music. She took lessons in counterpoint and contemporary music with Cage, who offered to teach her for free if she taught him about Indian music in return. Sarabhai agreed and through her Cage became acquainted with Indian music and philosophy. The purpose of music, according to Sarabhai's teacher in India, was [...] "to sober and quiet the mind, thus rendering it susceptible to divine influences", and this definition became one of the cornerstones of Cage's view on music and art in general.|$|E
2500|$|Shilton was a lower-order {{right-handed}} batsman and a left-arm bowler variously {{described as}} slow orthodox spin and medium-pace {{with the ability}} to [...] "break both ways and vary his pace without in any way altering his action". His best bowling was achieved before Warwickshire gained first-class status: in the match against Leicestershire in 1888, for example, he finished the game with four wickets in four balls. Despite not playing for a major team, Shilton was selected for occasional first-class representative matches across the 1880s, appearing in the North v South game in 1884 and in England XIs against the 1886 and 1888 Australians. He was credited, alongside Harry Pallett, with the bowling prowess that led to Warwickshire's elevation to first-class status, and Lord Hawke was quoted as <b>saying,</b> <b>when</b> Warwickshire was a [...] "second class" [...] county, that [...] "Shilton was the only first-class man in the team".|$|E

2500|$|In September 2016, Assange said {{he would}} agree to US prison in {{exchange}} for [...] President Obama granting Chelsea Manning [...] clemency. Obama commuted Manning's sentence on 17 January 2017. The next day, at his final presidential news conference, Obama stated, [...] "I don't {{pay a lot of}} attention to Mr. Assange's tweets, so that wasn't a consideration in this instance." [...] The same day, Assange's U.S.-based attorney Barry Pollack asserted (without <b>saying</b> <b>when</b> or where) that Assange [...] "had called for Chelsea Manning to receive clemency and be released immediately [...]" [...] Accordingly, Pollack maintained, the [...] commutation—which specified Manning would be freed four months hence—did not meet Assange's conditions. On 17 May 2017, Manning was released from prison. Two days later, Assange emerged on the embassy's balcony and told a crowd that, despite no longer facing a Swedish sex investigation, he would remain inside the embassy in order to avoid extradition to the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Atlus {{wanted to}} capture a wider {{audience}} with this game. For this they went through a light novel approach while writing its story and hired character designer Suzuhito Yasuda. Although {{they wanted to make}} Devil Survivor different from previous Megami Tensei games, the team still wanted to make sure it belonged to the series. They considered the series famous for its dark storytelling and wanted to keep it intact. In order to make the game accessible to followers of the series, they decided to focus more on the demons' development rather than the strategy combat. During development of the game, the staff got positive feedback from the players in that the game still felt like a role-playing game. They found the Nintendo DS to be suitable for Devil Survivor due to its dual screen which would fit simulation games. Their <b>saying</b> <b>when</b> starting development was [...] "Let's breathe new life into the series and really shake things up." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{this shift}} of Brown's {{interests}} toward psychoanalysis {{led to the}} writing of Love's Body, which concluded that [...] "there is only poetry", showed, according to Brown, that pursuing the implications of Freud's ideas consistently led to the breakdown of [...] "categories of traditional 'rationality' still accepted as authoritative by both Marx and Freud; that massive breakdown...which Nietzsche baptized {{with the name of}} Dionysus." [...] Brown wrote that he now realized that he did not really know what he was <b>saying</b> <b>when</b> he called for [...] "Dionysian consciousness" [...] in the last chapter of Life Against Death. Brown added that it was clear to him in that work [...] "that at that deep level which can only be expressed in myth or metaphor, Freud's 'instinct theory' needed to be remythologized in terms of Dionysus, that is to say in terms of instinctual dialectics rather than instinctual dualism. Or, to use another metaphor, in terms of Heraclitus rather than Empedocles." [...] Brown concluded that the last chapter of Life Against Death was disfigured by the misleading idea that the world could be 'a pastoral scene of peace and pleasure, luxe calme et volupté, Baudelaire's utopian image invoked by Marcuse in Eros and Civilization." ...|$|E
