She was commissioned on 22 October 1871 {{at the cost of}} 1,200,428 <b>Swedish</b> <b>krona.</b> The delay in construction may have been due to manufacturing difficulties by the British supplier of her armor plate. Generally the monitors were kept in reserve for most of the year; only being commissioned for two to four months during the summer and fall. Loke made only seven cruises, the last in late 1880, and was not commissioned afterwards. Funds were requested to rebuild her in 1903 and 1908, but they were refused. She was decommissioned on 21 August 1908 and advertised for sale. The details of her fate are unknown, but presumably she was sold and scrapped.|$|E

40|$|Background: Like other {{developed}} countries with aging populations, Sweden is expecting large {{increases in the}} prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and corresponding escalations {{in the cost of}} care for patients with this disease. Galantamine, a new acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and nicotinic modulator, has proved effective in managing patients with Alzheimer's disease in clinical trials. Objective: To estimate the long-term health and economic impact of galantamine {{from the perspective of the}} public health payer in Sweden. Design and setting: The Assessment of Health Economics in Alzheimer's Disease (AHEAD) model compares galantamine treatment with no pharmacologic treatment. It consists of a module based on trial data followed by a projection module that uses the trial results to predict the time until patients require full-time care (FTC) or until their death. Forecasts were made for up to 10 years. The model was customised to Sweden by using Swedish resource use profiles obtained from the literature. Results: Galantamine is predicted to reduce the time patients require FTC by almost 10 %. Approximately 5. 6 patients with mild-to-moderate disease would need to be treated to avoid one year of FTC. This would result in savings averaging 27 436 <b>Swedish</b> <b>kronas</b> (SEK) [3131 euros (EUR) ] per patient over 10 years (1998 values). To avoid one year of FTC, 3. 9 patients with moderate disease would need to be treated, with savings averaging SEK 49 019 (EUR 5594) per patient over 10. 5 years. Sensitivity analyses of key parameters, such as proportion of patients needing FTC treated in the community, cost of care in an institution, cost of FTC care in the community, the price of galantamine, and the discount rate, found savings with galantamine would occur under most circumstances. Conclusion: Galantamine can increase the time before patients require FTC, and may also lead to savings as treatment costs are offset by reductions in other healthcare expenditures and the costs associated with FTC.

25|$|The Swedish Rail Administration had {{proposed}} that the line was to be built with the government agency as owner and with either SJ or private railway companies as train operators. However, the Cabinet of Carl Bildt wanted private sector involvement in the construction and operation of the line. In 1993, the Government {{put in place a}} public tender to build and operate the line. In 1994, Arlanda Link Consortium was chosen, consisting of the Nordic Construction Company, SIAB, Vattenfall, GEC Alsthom and Mowlem. A-Banan Projekt AB was established as a limited company in 1994 to oversee the project. The consortium established A-Train AB to be the project developer and then operate the Arlanda Express until 2040. The legal responsibility for the project was transferred from the consortium to A-Train in 1995. As part of the agreement, A-Train received from the Swedish Government 850 million <b>Swedish</b> <b>krona</b> (SEK) in a grant and SEK1 billion in a loan to help finance the project.

While SJ had several times during the 1980s agreed to reduce their rates, NSB had not offered the same, and was making a profit of NOK 60 to 70 million per year. LKAB {{stated that they}}, by taking over operations themselves, could save SEK200 million per year. In addition, they stated that they could save between SEK 50 to 100 million in auxiliary fields. LKAB had sent an application to Swedish authorities for permission to take over operations, and had received positive feedback from SJ. NSB, on the other hand, did not support a solution where they did not operate the trains themselves. LKAB stated that if an agreement with NSB could not be reached, they would shift all their transport to the Port of Luleå.|$|E
