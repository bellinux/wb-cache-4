5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of specifications, military, ISO, DIN, ASME that pins may be made to. And size can even vary by <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> material. Metric <b>dowel</b> <b>pins</b> are often found in two size. In DIN 6325 {{standard}} the <b>dowel</b> <b>pins</b> are slightly larger than the nominal value. For example a 3 mm <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> will range from 3.002 to 3.008. In the ISO 2338 standard the <b>dowel</b> <b>pins</b> are slightly smaller - 3mm nominal range is 2.986 to 3.000. The terminology (e.g. [...] "oversized", [...] "standard") is not entirely consistent across suppliers. In inch pins [...] "oversized" [...] refers to pins that are more significantly oversized for worn out <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> holes.

In {{order to}} balance the force loading on the <b>dowel</b> <b>pin,</b> improve the load {{carrying}} capacity on pin-hole type output mechanism the FA cycloid drive, we considered to add uniform loading ring on the cantilever end of the pins in this paper.

50|$|Two-piece plain {{bearings}}, {{known as}} full bearings in industrial machinery, {{are commonly used}} for larger diameters, such as crankshaft bearings. The two halves are called shells. There are various systems used to keep the shells located. The most common method is a tab on the parting line edge that correlates with a notch in the housing to prevent axial movement after installation. For large, thick shells a button stop or <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> is used. The button stop is screwed to the housing, while the <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> keys the two shells together. Another less common method uses a <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> that keys the shell to the housing through a hole or slot in the shell.|$|R

When the impression is poured up, it is directly mounted on a plastic base or tray that already has a built-in condyle to form a complete articulator when the two halves are joined. By eliminating the need to pour up a stone base, the single-pour is a much faster system than the Stone Base system. There are varieties of single-pour systems that use <b>dowel</b> <b>pins,</b> and there are some that omit the need for <b>dowel</b> <b>pins</b> by creating the model completely out of die stone.|$|R

40|$|Statement of Problem: Given that meticulous implant {{prosthodontic}} {{procedures are}} recommended {{to obtain the}} best possible intraoral fit, the die systems used for multi implant casts warrant further investigation. Die stone expansion and errors introduced by removable die casts may exceed the accuracy required for the passive fit of implant prosthesis. Purpose: The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the linear dimensional accuracy between the implant master die and three conceptually different die systems such as Pindex system, Accu-trac precision die system, and Conventional brass <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> system. Materials and Methods: Thirty impressions of implant master die were made with polyether impression material. Ten experimental implant casts were fabricated for each of the three different die systems tested: Accu-trac precision die tray system, Pindex system, and conventional brass <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> system. The solid experimental casts were sectioned and then removed from the die system 30 times. Linear distances between all six possible distances were measured from one centre of the transfer coping to the other, using a co-ordinate measuring machine in millimeters up to accuracy of 0. 5 microns. Data were tabulated and statistically analyzed by Binomial non parametric test using SPSS version 15. Results: Significant differences were found for distance A-B (P = 0. 002), A-C (P = 0. 002), A-D (P value = 0. 002), and B-D (P = 0. 021) in Conventional <b>Dowel</b> <b>pin</b> system however for Accu-trac precision die tray system, it was significant only for distance A-D (P = 0. 002) but for Pindex system it was non-significant for all the distances measured.

The ribbon connectors have <b>dowel</b> <b>pins</b> which are used to match with the connectors on the wave guide ribbons. These <b>dowel</b> <b>pins</b> are also used during the nesting operation, locating and positioning measurements. The nesting operation is the insertion of one cylinder into another, aligning them with one another and fastening them together into a homogeneous assembly.
