The shoulder spine has a large flat trapezoidal base; after a sudden kink, a more narrow straight <b>shaft,</b> <b>flat</b> but with a protruding ridge on the outer side, projects to behind from the lower base edge. The bony plates on its back were rather small and relatively low, triangular or fin-shaped. The largest plates, about fifteen centimetres high and with a base length of twenty centimetres, are similar in profile to those of Hesperosaurus, though of a more reduced relative size. They were not [...] "splates", i.e. featuring a thickened middle section, but almost uniformly flat, with a rough and veined surface.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. How {{to apply}} a torque is a very {{important}} problem in finite element analysis, and the traditional method utilizes a series of forces instead of the torque, but often leads in stress concentration. In this paper, many methods are being used to achieve the torque. And these methods are being compared, thus we can get several availability methods. Introduction The problem of torque exists in almost every engineering field, such as structural, aerospace and so on. And how to apply torque load accurately is always a matter in finite element analysis. Many structures such as screw tap, polish rod of machine tool, mixer shaft, drive shaft of automobile etc [...] . In order to get precise results of structural subjected to external load, including stress, strain, displacement and other mechanical variables, the modern design method such as finite element method has been employed to solve the problem. According to the engineering experiences, some of traits for instance the keyway of <b>shaft,</b> <b>flat</b> of thread must be considered. So how to apply torque on a section of solid model has become a problem. In general, different methods always lead to the same result. But because of stress concentration and other reasons, different methods lead to different stiff matrixes, even bring about stress singularity; ultimately affect the result’s estimation.

50|$|Linear motion roller-element {{bearings}} {{are typically}} designed for either <b>shafts</b> or <b>flat</b> surfaces. Flat surface bearings often consist of rollers and are mounted in a cage, {{which is then}} placed between the two flat surfaces; a common example is drawer-support hardware. Roller-element bearing for a shaft use bearing balls in a groove designed to recirculate them {{from one end to}} the other as the bearing moves; as such, they are called linear ball bearings or recirculating bearings.|$|R

Examples of machines that were powered with a horse engine include the threshing machine, the corn sheller, pumps and machines for sawing wood. Horse engines were modular in {{that they could be}} attached to whichever implement they were needed for at the time, preventing these machines from needing to incorporate power sources into their design. They could also be used interchangeably with other forms of power, such as a hand crank, line shaft, stationary engine, or the PTO <b>shaft</b> or <b>flat</b> belt pulley from a tractor, which eventually replaced them. Today there are modern versions of these being built that have been used with great success to do household chores as well as power a complete Amish-run machine shop in Kentucky.|$|R

The {{aim of this}} paper is to give a better understanding of this phenomenon. In a first part of the paper, the general principles of the fracture mechanics are concisely described. The energy approach as well as the stress intensity factor (SIF) approach are explained. An analytical method, a numeric method as well as an experimental method to determine the SIF are discussed. Special attention is given to the experimental method. A theoretical model predicting the deflection of a pipe tested in a resonant bending test setup is evaluated and compared to experimental measured deflections. Several methods to measure the crack growth in a pipe during and after a fatigue bending test are discussed. In addition, an overview is given of results obtained by other authors in the field of fatigue crack growth behaviour of pipes...|$|R
25|$|An {{ice hockey}} stick {{is a piece}} of {{equipment}} used in ice hockey to shoot, pass, and carry the puck across the ice. Ice hockey sticks are approximately 150–200cm long, composed of a long, slender <b>shaft</b> with a <b>flat</b> extension at one end called the blade. The blade is the part of the stick used to contact the puck, and is typically 25 to 40cm long. Stick dimensions can vary widely, as they are usually built to suit a particular player's size and preference. The blade is positioned at roughly a 135° angle from the axis of the shaft, giving the stick a partly 'L-shaped' appearance. The shaft of the stick is fairly rigid, but it has some flexibility to benefit some shots.|$|R
50|$|A {{diagnosis}} {{is a statement}} of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group. According to Brusatte et al. (2011), Dryptosaurus can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: {{the combination of a}} reduced humerus (humerus: femur ratio = 0.375) and a large hand (phalanx I-1:femur ratio = 0.200), the strong mediolateral expansion of the ischial tubercle, which is approximately 1.7 times as wide as the shaft immediately distally, the presence of an ovoid fossa on the medial surface of the femoral shaft immediately proximal to the medial condyle, which is demarcated anteriorly by the mesiodistal crest and demarcated medially by a novel crest, the presence of a proximomedially trending ridge on the anterior surface of the fibula immediately proximal to the iliofibularis tubercle, the lip on the lateral surface of the lateral condyle of the astragalus is prominent and is overlapping the proximal surface of the calcaneum, metatarsal IV is observed with a <b>flat</b> <b>shaft</b> proximally, resulting in a semiovoid cross section that is much wider mediolaterally than it is long anteroposteriorly.|$|R
40|$|AIM:To {{compare the}} {{differences}} of visual acuity and corneal astigmatism postoperatively between conventional refractive cataract surgery and that assisted by femtosecond laser. METHODS:Sixty patients(60 eyes) with age-related cataract and cornea astigmatism {{were divided into}} femtosecond group and conventional group randomly or voluntarily. The <b>flat</b> <b>shaft,</b> steep shaft and diopter of corneal astigmatism in patients in femtosecond group were inputted into the online vector calculators to get the location and width of the incision. Then femtosecond laser was used to make corneal releasing incision, the main and auxiliary incision. Phacoemulsification and aspheric multifocal intraocular lens implantation were undergone. Patients in conventional group received full-thickness relaxing incision by cornea paracentesis knife at the steepest meridian axis during phacoemulsification. Then aspheric multifocal intraocular lenses were implanted. Uncorrected distance visual acuity(UCDVA), uncorrected near visual acuity(UCNVA) and cornea astigmatism were observed at 1 d, 1 wk and 1 mo postoperative. RESULTS:UCVA of patients in both groups was improved after the surgeries. UCDVA and UCNVA of femtosecond group were {{higher than those of}} conventional group, while the cornea astigmatism of femtosecond group was lower than that of conventional group. CONCLUSION:Refractile cataract surgery assisted by femtosecond laser canoffer better visual quality than conventional refractive cataract surgery because of lower cornea astigmatism and better visual acuity...|$|R

In {{proportion}} to the massiness of the column, we require its foot to express merely the power of bearing up; in fact, it can do without a foot, like the Squire in Chevy Chase, if the ground only be hard enough. But if the column be slender, and look {{as if it might}} lose its balance, we require it to look as if it had hold of the ground, or the ground hold of it, it does not matter which,--some expression of claw, prop, or socket. Now let us go back to Fig. XI., and take up one of the bases there, in the state in which we left it. We may leave out the two lower steps (with which we have nothing more to do, as they have become the united floor or foundation of the whole), and, for the sake of greater clearness, I shall not draw the bricks in the <b>shaft,</b> nor the <b>flat</b> stone which carries them, though the reader is to suppose them remaining as drawn in Fig. XI.; but I shall only draw the shaft and its two essential members of base, Xb and Yb, as explained at p. 65, above: and now, expressing the rounding of these numbers on a somewhat larger scale, we have the profile a, Fig. XII.; b, the perspective appearance of such a base seen from above; and c, the plan of it.|$|R
50|$|Sticks are {{approximately}} 150-200 cm long, {{composed of a}} long, slender <b>shaft</b> and a <b>flat</b> extension at one end called the blade. The curved part where the blade and the shaft meet is called a taper. The blade {{is the part of}} the stick used to contact the puck, and is typically 10 to 15 inches long. Stick dimensions can vary widely, as they are usually built to suit a particular player's size. Taller players usually use longer sticks. There is some variance on the height of the stick in preference of the player. A player favouring fast stick handling and good puck control would opt for a shorter stick, while a player wanting a harder, faster shot would opt for a longer stick. Oftentimes defenseman use longer sticks than forwards. The blade's angle depends on the height of the stick, but is usually positioned around 45 degrees. The blade is often curved in the direction toward which the skater moves forward, to aid in retaining or lifting the puck off the playing surface. This curvature of the stick greatly increases the speed of the player's shot. The downside to the increased curvature is that shots on the backhand side of the stick are more difficult to execute and are less accurate and/or not as powerful. The shaft of the stick is fairly rigid, but it has some flexibility to benefit some shots. Common ice hockey shots include: wrist shot, slap shot, snap shot and backhand.|$|R
40|$|Methods for a {{blood pump}} bearing system within a pump housing to support {{long-term}} high-speed rotation of a rotor with an impeller blade having {{a plurality of}} individual magnets disposed thereon to provide a small radial air gap between the magnets and a stator of less than 0. 025 inches. The bearing system may be mounted within a flow straightener, diffuser, or other pump element to support the shaft of a pump rotor. The bearing system includes a zirconia shaft having a radiused end. The radiused end has a first radius selected to be about three {{times greater than the}} radius of the zirconia shaft. The radiused end of the zirconia <b>shaft</b> engages a <b>flat</b> sapphire endstone. Due to the relative hardness of these materials a flat is quickly produced during break-in on the zirconia radiused end of precisely the size necessary to support thrust loads whereupon wear substantially ceases. Due to the selection of the first radius, the change in shaft end-play during pump break-in is limited to a total desired end-play of less than about 0. 010 inches. Radial loads are supported by an olive hole ring jewel that makes near line contact around the circumference of the shaft to support high speed rotation with little friction. The width of olive hole ring jewel is small to allow heat to conduct through to thereby prevent heat build-up in the bearing. A void defined by the bearing elements may fill with blood that then coagulates within the void. The coagulated blood is then conformed to the shape of the bearing surfaces...|$|R
