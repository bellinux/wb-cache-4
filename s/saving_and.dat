5|$|Beginning in 1879, Walker and the {{political}} economist Henry George engaged in a prominent debate over economic rents, land, money, and taxes. Based {{on a series of}} lectures delivered at Harvard, Walker published his Land and Its Rent in 1883 as a criticism of George's 1879 Progress and Poverty. Walker's position on international bimetallism influenced his arguments that the primary cause of economic depressions was not land speculation, but rather constriction of the money supply. Walker also criticized George's assumptions that technical progress was always labor <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> whether land held for speculation was unproductive or inefficient.|$|E
5|$|Diffusion {{of crude}} natural gas through special {{semipermeable}} membranes and other barriers is another method {{to recover and}} purify helium. In 1996, the U.S. had proven helium reserves, in such gas well complexes, of about 147 billion standard cubic feet (4.2 billion SCM). At rates of use at that time (72 million SCM {{per year in the}} U.S.; see pie chart below) this would have been enough helium for about 58 years of U.S. use, and less than this (perhaps 80% of the time) at world use rates, although factors in <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> processing impact effective reserve numbers.|$|E
50|$|By 1958, American <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> Loan {{had five}} offices. In the 1960s it added four {{branches}} on Oahu. The 1971 acquisition of Kauai <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> Loan added four branches. Three years later, in 1974, American <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> Loan merged with Maui Savings & Loan. American <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> Loan now had branches on five islands. When American <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> Loan acquired Pacific <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> Loan Association of Hawaii in 1977, it added another six locations on Oahu. In 1978, American <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> Loan marked a milestone when it achieved $1 billion in assets.|$|R

5|$|In October 2012, Steam {{introduced}} non-gaming applications, {{which are}} sold through the {{service in the}} same manner as games. Creativity and productivity applications can access the core functions of the Steamworks API, allowing them to use Steam's simplified installation and updating process, and incorporate features including cloud <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> Steam Workshop. Steam also allows game soundtracks to be purchased to be played via Steam Music or integrated with the user's other media players. Valve have also added the ability for publishers to rent and sell digital movies via the service, with initially most being video game documentaries. Following Warner Bros. Entertainment offering the Mad Max films alongside the September 2015 release of the 2015 game based on the series, Lionsgate entered into agreement with Valve to rent over one hundred feature films from its catalog through Steam starting in April 2016, with more films following later. In March 2017, Crunchyroll started offering various anime for purchase or rent through Steam. With the onset of Steam Machines, the Steam storefront also includes the ability to purchase Steam Machine-related hardware.|$|E
5|$|Poultry, {{kept for}} their eggs {{and for their}} meat, include chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks. The great {{majority}} of laying birds used for egg production are chickens. Methods for keeping layers range from free-range systems, where the birds can roam as they will but are housed at night for their own protection, through semi-intensive systems where they are housed in barns and have perches, litter and some freedom of movement, to intensive systems where they are kept in cages. The battery cages are arranged in long rows in multiple tiers, with external feeders, drinkers, and egg collection facilities. This is the most labour <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> economical method of egg production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds as the birds are unable to exhibit their normal behaviours.|$|E
5|$|Steam is {{a digital}} {{distribution}} platform developed by Valve Corporation, which offers {{digital rights management}} (DRM), multiplayer gaming, video streaming and social networking services. Steam provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games, and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud <b>saving,</b> <b>and</b> in-game voice and chat functionality. The software provides a freely available application programming interface (API) called Steamworks, which developers can use to integrate many of Steam's functions into their products, including networking, matchmaking, in-game achievements, micro-transactions, and support for user-created content through Steam Workshop. Though initially developed for use on Microsoft Windows operating systems, versions for OS X and Linux were later released. Mobile apps with connected functionality with the main software were later released for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone devices in the 2010s.|$|E

5|$|The BASIC {{interpreter}} {{was developed}} from that {{used on the}} ZX81 and a ZX81 BASIC program can be typed into a Spectrum largely unmodified, but Spectrum BASIC included many extra features {{making it easier to}} use. The ZX Spectrum character set was expanded from that of the ZX81, which did not feature lower-case letters. Spectrum BASIC included extra keywords for the more advanced display and sound, and supported multi-statement lines. The cassette interface was much more advanced, <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> loading around five times faster than the ZX81 (1500 bits per second compared to 307), and unlike the ZX81, the Spectrum could maintain the TV display during tape storage and retrieval operations. As well as being able to save programs, the Spectrum could save the contents of arrays, the contents of the screen memory, and the contents of any defined range of memory addresses.|$|E
5|$|The games always {{feature a}} number of {{religious}} overtones; after the first Dragon Warrior game <b>saving,</b> <b>and</b> reviving characters who have died, is performed by clergy in churches. Bishops wander around the over-world of Dragon Quest Monsters and can heal wounded characters. The final enemy {{in some of the}} Dragon Quest games is called the Demon Lord; for instance in Dragon QuestVII, the Demon Lord (known as Orgodemir in that particular game) is the final boss, and there is a sidequest to battle against God. The first four Dragon Quest titles were subjected to censorship in their North American localizations, largely in keeping with Nintendo of America's content guidelines at the time that placed severe restrictions on religious iconography and mature content. When these games were remade for the Game Boy Color, most censorship was removed. The translated versions of the games have largely followed the originals since Dragon QuestVII.|$|E
5|$|Tyler {{cuts from}} Charlotte's buttocks, frying {{a strip of}} her flesh on a stove. Squires tells of how he began an affair with Monica, Tyler's wife and mother of his twin children, {{destroying}} Tyler's career. Tyler hands Squires the flesh, and he eats, fearing Charlotte will die. Tyler reveals how he hates cryptic crosswords, and how his son entered the Cambridge Crossword Competition, attempting to beat his mother's new husband: Squires. Squires realises that Charlotte is Tyler's daughter. Charlotte and Tyler sought revenge on Squires, but Tyler changed plans so Squires would include clues in the crossword. However, Simon's autopsy—Tyler explains—revealed that Simon and Charlotte were actually Squires's children, meaning Monica and Squires's relationship began earlier than he previously thought. Charlotte is past <b>saving,</b> <b>and</b> Tyler places a bullet on Squires's desk, quoting Chekhov's gun. Squires confirms that his middle name is Hector as he weeps over Charlotte, and Tyler circles something on the crossword. Charlotte is dead, and Squires loads the gun, placing it in his mouth. Blood splatters over the crossword and a second nina: RIP NHS.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the economy}} {{recovered}} in 1983, the residual effects of high inflation and {{high interest rates}} {{had a profound impact}} on the <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> loans industry. <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> loan associations were limited by interest rate ceilings. As a result of rising interest rates, many <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> loan institutions experienced frequent account withdrawals, as depositors moved their money to higher-earning accounts offered by commercial banks. The already struggling <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> loans industry posted large losses in 1981 and 1982. High mortgage rates eroded the value of mortgage-backed loans, the primary asset of <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> loan associations. These fixed-rate loans were sold at a loss in order to balance withdrawals. This asset liability mismatch was identified as the primary cause of the <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> loan crisis.|$|R
