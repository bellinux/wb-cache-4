40|$|In {{terms of}} {{electric}} ship energy requirement in navigation, the <b>ship</b> <b>charging</b> station location is especially important. In this paper, a multi-period <b>ship</b> <b>charging</b> station location optimization model is pro-posed to make location decision in overall, from initial possible station sites chosen to the capacity determination {{for the final}} location sites. In the first phase, {{from the perspective of}} external environment, find out all possible <b>ship</b> <b>charging</b> station candidate sites through the feasible analyze. In the second phase, taking the <b>ship</b> <b>charging</b> demands into consideration, the final <b>ship</b> <b>charging</b> station sites can be selected among the candidate sites based on backup coverage model. In the last phase, regarding the cost of construction and service capability for different grade as the main factor in capacity determination, the optimal capacity of each final <b>ship</b> <b>charging</b> station are determined by means of optimization method. Finally, an example of Yanqi lake in China is used to verify the validity of the proposed methodology. The reasonable location of charging station could ensure the electric energy supply and avoid congestion caused by <b>ship</b> <b>charging</b> gathering. The model can be easily generalized to other problems regarding facility allocation based on user demand...|$|R

2500|$|... eBay generates {{revenue by}} a complex system of fees for services, listing product features, and a Final Value Fee for sales {{proceeds}} by sellers. As of November 2012, the US-based eBay.com charges $0.10 to $2, {{based on the}} opening or reserve price, as an insertion fee for a basic auction-style listing without any adornments. The Final Value Fee amounts to 10% of {{the total amount of}} the sale, which is the price of the item plus <b>shipping</b> <b>charges.</b> Fixed-price listings have an insertion fee of $0.30, and the final value fee varies based on category and total amount of the sale (e.g., 13% for DVDs & Movies up to $50). The UK-based ebay.co.uk takes from £0.15 to a maximum rate of £3 per £100 for an ordinary listing and up to 10% of the final price. Reduced Final Value Fees are available to business registered customers.|$|E

40|$|Many firms {{divide the}} price a {{consumer}} pays {{for a good}} into two pieces - the price for the item itself and the price for shipping and handling. With fully rational customers, the exact division between the two prices is irrelevant - only the total price matters. We test this hypothesis by selling matched pairs of CDs and Xbox games {{in a series of}} field experiments on eBay. In theory, the ending auction price should vary inversely with the <b>shipping</b> <b>charge</b> to leave the total price paid constant. Contrary to the theory, we find that <b>charging</b> a high <b>shipping</b> cost and starting the auction at a low opening price leads to higher numbers of bidders and higher revenues when the <b>shipping</b> <b>charge</b> is not excessive. We show that these results can be accounted for by boundedly rational bidding behavior such as loss-aversion with separate mental accounts for different attributes of the price or disregard for shipping costs.

40|$|Using {{field data}} {{gathered}} from eBay's online marketplace, this dissertation analyzes {{the impact of}} free shipping in a market where the total price of an item is composed of two separate partitions. In this case, the act of remotely purchasing an item online requires some sort of delivery, and thereby creates an additional choice variable for firms: the <b>shipping</b> <b>charge.</b> Moreover, this choice variable need {{not have anything to}} do with the actual shipping cost facing a firm. Of course, according to the standard economic model, consumers should seamlessly integrate the <b>shipping</b> <b>charge</b> so that only the total price is relevant for demand-a consumer comparing next-day delivery of: (i) a brand-new 32 GB iPad for $ 499. 99 + $ 20. 00 shipping; and (ii) a brand-new 32 GB iPad for $ 519. 99 + Free Shipping should be indifferent between the two options, since the sum of the individual price components is the same for both. Evidence from both the economics and psychology literature, however, suggests otherwise. In Chapter 1, I investigate the impact of free shipping using a large eBay dataset on iPad sales. I find evidence that free shipping leads to both significantly increased bidder valuations and higher probability of sale. I also uncover new results for positively-priced shipping, where a seller's choice of <b>shipping</b> <b>charge</b> has a nonlinear impact on: (i) revenue (conditional on sale); (ii) likelihood of sale; and (iii) unconditional expected revenue. In Chapter 2, I investigate the impact of free shipping using two additional eBay datasets. In replicating each component of the main analysis, I confirm the general robustness of the empirical results in Chapter 1. When comparing estimates across the different items, I also find that the impact of free shipping varies by product value. Finally, in Chapter 3 I develop a formal model in which several of the key empirical results are captured in a simplified, partitioned-price auction setting. In particular, I show that an equilibrium exists in which the optimal pricing strategy includes simultaneous offers of both free and non-free shipping, even when the (expected) profit per unit is larger for the free shipping item, due to the added transaction utility experienced by consumers. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|R
