5|$|The {{original}} plant uses Babcock & Wilcox Volund boilers {{to provide}} steam {{for a single}} Ansaldo turbo generator rated at 19.2MW. The third line uses a Von Roll Inova reciprocating grate to burn the waste, and generates electricity using a single Von Roll Inova three-pass <b>steam</b> <b>generator,</b> rated at 10MW.|$|E
5|$|Steam is {{provided}} by an elderly Marshall portable boilerâ€“ essentially a portable engine without the actual engine. It was built in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire in 1938 before being used by Thames Water as a stand by <b>steam</b> <b>generator.</b> It was given to Kew Bridge Steam Museum (now the London Museum of Water & Steam) before being {{passed on to the}} Westonzoyland Museum and then restored with a grant from the Preservation of Industrial and Scientific Materials Foundation (PRISM). The boiler provides steam at 50 Pounds per square inch (psi) to the other exhibits. It has been fitted with two whistles, one from Wattstown and the other from Ty Mawr Collieries in Wales, both of which were donated by the National Coal Board. Along with the boiler in the outdoor courtyard area are a waterwheel pump unit built by G. H. Harris of Wadebridge, a Lee Howl pump and Lister deep well pump.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of a {{pressurized}} water reactor, the steam turbine is separated from the nuclear system. To detect a leak in the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> and thus the passage of radioactive water at an early stage, an activity meter is mounted to track the outlet steam of the <b>steam</b> <b>generator.</b> In contrast, boiling water reactors pass radioactive water through the steam turbine, so the turbine is kept as part of the radiologically controlled area of the nuclear power station.|$|E
50|$|Entire <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> {{are often}} {{replaced}} in plant mid-life, {{which is a}} major undertaking. Most U.S. PWR plants have had <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> replaced.|$|R
50|$|In {{a ten-year}} project {{completed}} in 2011 and costing $671 million, Edison replaced the <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> in both reactors with Mitsubishi <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> of modified design. Because of the reactors' two-loop design, uncommon for such large reactors of that era, the <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> were amongst {{the largest in}} the industry. A common shortcoming of these large <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> was tube wear, requiring replacement earlier than their 40-year design life. The <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> being the largest components in the reactor required a temporary hole through the concrete containment shell. The Unit 2 replacement was completed in 2009 and Unit 3 in 2011. Edison estimated that the modernization would save customers $1 billion during the plant's license period, which at the time ran until 2022.|$|R
40|$|Pursuant to 10 CFR 50. 90, the STP Nuclear Operating Company (STPNOC) {{requests}} {{an amendment}} to the South Texas Project Facility Operating Licenses and the Units 1 and 2 Technical Specifications. This change applies to each unit after replacement of the <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> with the Model A 94 <b>steam</b> <b>generators.</b> The Unit 1 <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> were replaced with the Model A 94 <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> in the Spring of 2000. The South Texas Project Unit 2 <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> are planned for replacement with the Model A 94 <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> in late 2002. The proposed amendment will revise the Facility Operating Licenses and Technical Specifications to reflect a 1. 4 % increase in the reactor core power level from 3, 800 to 3, 853 megawatts thermal (Mwt). This amendment is based on a reduced core thermal power level uncertainty associated with a more accurate measurement of feedwater flow. The increased accuracy of the feedwater flow measurement is provided by the CROSSFLOW Ultrasonic Flo...|$|R
25|$|In February 2000, Unit 2 {{experienced}} a <b>Steam</b> <b>Generator</b> Tube Rupture (SGTR), which allowed primary water to leak into the secondary system {{through one of}} the steam generators. All four steam generators were subsequently replaced.|$|E
25|$|In {{a nuclear}} power station, the {{pressurized}} steam is fed through a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator connected to the electric grid for transmission. After passing through the turbine the secondary coolant (water-steam mixture) is cooled down and condensed in a condenser. The condenser converts the steam to a liquid {{so that it can}} be pumped back into the <b>steam</b> <b>generator,</b> and maintains a vacuum at the turbine outlet so that the pressure drop across the turbine, and hence the energy extracted from the steam, is maximized. Before being fed into the <b>steam</b> <b>generator,</b> the condensed steam (referred to as feedwater) is sometimes preheated in order to minimize thermal shock.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear fuel in {{the reactor}} {{pressure}} vessel {{is engaged in a}} fission chain reaction, which produces heat, heating the water in the primary coolant loop by thermal conduction through the fuel cladding. The hot primary coolant is pumped into a heat exchanger called the <b>steam</b> <b>generator,</b> where it flows through hundreds or thousands of small tubes. Heat is transferred through the walls of these tubes to the lower pressure secondary coolant located on the sheet side of the exchanger where the coolant evaporates to pressurized steam. The transfer of heat is accomplished without mixing the two fluids to prevent the secondary coolant from becoming radioactive. Some common <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> arrangements are u-tubes or single pass heat exchangers.|$|E
50|$|The first five, re-manufactured in 1983 {{and early}} 1984 were outshopped without <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> became Via Rail class GPA-418a while the remainder, re-manufactured with Vapor-OK <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> in mid-1984 to mid-1985 became Via Rail class GPA-418b.|$|R
50|$|Unit 1 had its two <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> {{replaced}} in 2002 and its reactor vessel closure head {{replaced in}} 2006, while unit 2 had its two <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> replaced in 2003, and its vessel closure head replaced in 2007.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hot water}} from the {{reactors}} is sent, via large pipes, into heat exchangers called <b>steam</b> <b>generators.</b> There {{the heat from the}} pressurized, subcooled reactor coolant water is transferred, through tube walls, to water being fed into the <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> from a separate feed system. In the A1W and A2W systems, the reactor coolant water is kept between 525 and 545 F. In the <b>steam</b> <b>generators,</b> the {{water from the}} feed system is converted to steam at [...] and a pressure of about [...] Once the reactor coolant water has given off its heat in the <b>steam</b> <b>generators,</b> it is returned, via large electric pumps (four per reactor), to the reactors to repeat the cycle.|$|R
25|$|During power operation, {{heavy water}} was {{circulated}} by primary pumps through the U-tubes containing the fuel assemblies which heated the water. The heated water then flowed through an inverted U-tube <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> where {{the heat was}} transferred to the secondary side light water which turned to steam. The steam flowed to an oil-fired superheater which increased the steam quality before the steam entered the turbine which spun the electrical generator. After passing through the <b>steam</b> <b>generator,</b> the primary loop water was pumped back to the reactor by the primary pumps to repeat the cycle. The primary loop heavy water was pressurized to ensure that the heavy water remained liquid and did not flash to steam at any point in the loop.|$|E
25|$|Algoma Central 78 is {{the former}} Denver and Rio Grande PB-1 6002. It was {{converted}} to a <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> car in October 1965. It gained Blomberg B trucks in 1980. It was sold to Ansco in late 1987 for service on the Ski Train. It was sold again in 2007 to the Algoma Central.|$|E
25|$|The {{water level}} in the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> and nuclear reactor is {{controlled}} using the feedwater system. The feedwater pump has the task of taking {{the water from the}} condensate system, increasing the pressure and forcing it into either the steam generators (in the case of a pressurized water reactor) or directly into the reactor (for boiling water reactors).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how plant engineers can efficiently generate steam {{when there are}} <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> and Heat Recovery <b>Steam</b> <b>Generators</b> in their plant.

25|$|The {{rebuilding}} lengthened {{the entire}} train to 455 feet (139 m) and seven cars. The power car had 12ft (3.7 m) added {{to accommodate a}} larger, 1,200hp (890kW) V16 Winton diesel engine. The RPO/baggage car was lengthened by eight feet (2.4 m) to take a <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> for train heating, and {{was followed by the}} addition of a diner/lounge car.|$|E
25|$|All freight units, and the CLC-built Model CPA/B-16-4 were {{designed}} with a B-B wheel arrangement, while passenger units (in {{addition to having}} different gearing) featured an unusual B-A1A wheel configuration, as the rear truck required an extra unpowered axle to help distribute {{the weight of the}} <b>steam</b> <b>generator.</b> Most C-liners were fitted out with electrical generators and traction motors manufactured by Westinghouse Electric.|$|E
25|$|The Yarrow {{superheater}} {{consisted of}} hairpin tubes, {{parallel to the}} existing <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> tubes. One bank of the generator tubes was separated in two, with individual lower water drums for them. The superheater {{was placed in the}} gap formed between these, with both ends of its tubes connected to a single superheater header drum, and an internal baffle to separate wet and dry steam.|$|E

50|$|The reactor {{pressure}} vessel of the first reactor was installed in June 2012, and the second in November 2014. The first {{pressure vessel}} had been imported from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan, and <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> from Areva in France.

25|$|In a {{combined}} cycle power plant, {{the heat of}} the gas turbine's exhaust is used to generate steam by passing it through a heat recovery <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> (HRSG) with a live steam temperature between 420 and 580Â°C. The condenser of the Rankine cycle is usually cooled by water from a lake, river, sea or cooling towers. This temperature can be as low as 15Â°C.|$|E
25|$|A {{fossil fuel}} <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> {{includes}} an economizer, a steam drum, and the furnace with its steam generating tubes and superheater coils. Necessary safety valves are located at suitable points to relieve excessive boiler pressure. The air and flue gas path equipment include: forced draft (FD) fan, air preheater (AP), boiler furnace, induced draft (ID) fan, fly ash collectors (electrostatic precipitator or baghouse) and the flue gas stack.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of large}} {{supplementary}} firing in Combined Cycle Systems with high gas turbine inlet temperatures causes the efficiency to drop. For this reason the Combined Cycle Plants with maximum supplementary firing are only of minimal importance today, {{in comparison to}} simple Combined Cycle installations. However, they have two advantages that is a) coal can be burned in the <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> as the supplementary fuel, b) has very good part load efficiency.|$|E
5|$|NuScale {{designs and}} markets small modular nuclear {{reactors}} that the Department of Energy {{expects to be}} commercially available around 2025. Its designs use the light water approach to cooling and power generation that is common in conventional nuclear plants. Water is heated by the nuclear core {{at the base of}} the reactor vessel. Heated water flows upwards inside the riser, then down over <b>steam</b> <b>generators.</b> As heat is transferred to <b>steam</b> <b>generators,</b> the water becomes cooler and denser, sinking back to the bottom of the device, where the cycle is repeated. Heat transferred to the <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> is used to create steam that turns a turbine, which drives an electrical generator.|$|R

50|$|The Bruce A <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> utilize a {{separate}} large horizontal shared steam drum (with one steam drum common to four <b>steam</b> <b>generators),</b> a design dropped {{in most other}} plants at the time. Issues related to the AECL requested design of the tube supports caused repair and delay costs, which exceeded the net worth of the builder Babcock & Wilcox Canada.|$|R
25|$|The coolant {{is pumped}} around the primary circuit by {{powerful}} pumps. After picking up heat as it passes through the reactor core, the primary coolant transfers heat in a <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> to water in a lower pressure secondary circuit, evaporating the secondary coolant to saturated steam â€” in most designs 6.2MPa (60atm, 900psia), 275Â°C (530Â°F) â€” {{for use in the}} steam turbine. The cooled primary coolant is then returned to the reactor vessel to be heated again.|$|E
25|$|The ALCO FA was {{a family}} of B-B diesel {{locomotives}} designed to haul freight trains. The locomotives were built by a partnership of ALCO and General Electric in Schenectady, New York, between January 1946 and May 1959. They were of a cab unit design, and both cab-equipped lead (A unit) FA and cabless booster (B unit) FB models were built. A dual passenger-freight version, the FPA/FPB, was also offered. It was equipped with a <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> for heating passenger cars.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{steam power}} is {{generated}} by the submarine's nuclear reactor delivering pressurized hot water to the <b>steam</b> <b>generator,</b> which generates steam to drive the steam-driven turbines and generators. While the emergency diesel generator is starting up, power can be provided from the submarine's battery through the ship service motor generators. Likewise, propulsion is normally delivered through the submarine's steam-driven main turbines that drive the submarine's propeller through a reduction gear system. The submarine has no main drive shaft, unlike conventional diesel electric submarines.|$|E
50|$|This {{nuclear reactor}} was {{a variant of}} the Submarine Fleet Reactor (SFR), an advance on the {{pressurized}} water reactor (PWR) plant design employed on the USS Nautilus (SSN-571). The S3W plant utilized horizontal U-tube <b>steam</b> <b>generators.</b> This concept developed into vertical U-tube <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> in the S5W reactor plant, and is in common use today on commercial PWR power plants.|$|R
40|$|Packaged <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> {{are widely}} used in process and power plants. They are also used as standby boilers in cogeneration/combined cycle plants. The general feeling among consultants, plant {{engineers}} and end users is that packaged <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> are "standard" or "off-the-shelf items", that there exists a model number for a given steam capacity and one has to live with whatever performance is offered by the boiler vendor. Unfortunately, boiler suppliers also encourage specifying of <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> based on standard, pre-packaged designs. A "standard" boiler has several limitations such as pre-determined furnace dimensions, tube length, surface area, tube spacings etc, {{which may or may}} not be the optimum choice for a given steam demand, particularly when today's emission levels have to be met. Also, operating costs, which form a significant portion of overall costs, are ignored by consultants when evaluating various designs for possible purchase. This paper highlights the importance of custom designing packaged <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> and the resulting benefits from boiler performance viewpoint...|$|R
