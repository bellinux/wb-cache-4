5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the <b>speech</b> <b>as</b> low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the <b>speech</b> <b>as</b> the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the <b>speech</b> <b>as</b> a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the <b>speech</b> <b>as</b> a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the <b>speech</b> <b>as</b> one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E

50|$|In modern times, rhetoric has {{consistently}} remained relevant as a civic art. In <b>speeches,</b> <b>as</b> {{well as in}} non-verbal forms, rhetoric continues {{to be used as}} a tool to influence communities from local to national levels.|$|R
5|$|However, {{potentially}} severe {{restrictions on}} free speech, {{some of which}} are elaborated upon below, may act as a disincentive to people expressing political views. These restrictions inevitably have a bearing on how representative democracy is upheld, and have also been said to impact the content of free <b>speech</b> <b>as</b> opposition parties are tempered by the fear of defamation suits.|$|E
5|$|The {{instrument}}ality of {{an action}} refers to whether the instrument of the action was: the body, as in physical actions; one's <b>speech,</b> <b>as</b> in speech acts; or the mind, as in thoughtful deliberation.|$|E
5|$|Vocabulary {{development}} is a process by which people acquire words. Babbling shifts towards meaningful <b>speech</b> <b>as</b> infants grow and produce their first words around the age of one year. In early word learning, infants build their vocabulary slowly. By the age of 18 months, infants can typically produce about 50 words and begin to make word combinations.|$|E

5|$|Diefenbaker was {{appointed}} to the House Committee on the Defence of Canada Regulations, an all-party committee which examined the wartime rules which allowed arrest and detention without trial. On June 13, 1940, Diefenbaker made his maiden <b>speech</b> <b>as</b> an MP, supporting the regulations, and emphatically stating that most Canadians of German descent were loyal. When the Mackenzie King government sought to force Canadians of Japanese descent from the Pacific Coast, Diefenbaker fought against the government's actions. However, his efforts were unsuccessful, and the forced relocation and internment of many Japanese-Canadians proceeded.|$|E
5|$|Heffernan {{sued the}} city, the mayor, and his {{superior}} officers under 42 U.S.C. §1983 {{in the federal}} District Court for New Jersey, claiming that his rights of freedom of <b>speech</b> <b>as</b> well as freedom of association had been violated. Heffernan contended that while he had not actually engaged in any protected speech, the department acted {{on the belief that}} he had, and the department should not have demoted him on the basis of that erroneous belief.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} <b>speech</b> <b>as</b> chairman, {{to the party}} conference in 1958, Driberg angered the Conservatives and their press {{supporters}} by referring to the Tory ideology as not essentially different from the German Herrenvolk philosophy. He had been contemplating for some time {{a return to the}} House of Commons, and in February 1959 was adopted as a candidate by the safe Barking constituency. In the General Election of October 1959, which delivered a 100-seat majority to Harold Macmillan's Conservative government, he won at Barking with a majority of exactly 12,000.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the time}} of McCarthy, the word McCarthyism has entered American <b>speech</b> <b>as</b> a general term {{for a variety of}} practices: aggressively {{questioning}} a person's patriotism, making poorly supported accusations, using accusations of disloyalty to pressure a person to adhere to conformist politics or to discredit an opponent, subverting civil and political rights in the name of national security, and the use of demagoguery are all often referred to as McCarthyism. McCarthyism can also be synonymous with the term witch-hunt, both referring to mass hysteria and moral panic.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher {{narrowly}} escaped {{injury in}} an IRA assassination {{attempt at a}} Brighton hotel {{early in the morning}} on 12 October 1984. Five people were killed, including the wife of minister John Wakeham. Thatcher was staying at the hotel to prepare for the Conservative Party conference, which she insisted should open as scheduled the following day. She delivered her <b>speech</b> <b>as</b> planned, though rewritten from her original draft, in a move that was widely supported across the political spectrum and enhanced her popularity with the public.|$|E

The episode was directed by Will Mackenzie.|$|E
50|$|Palilalia is {{considered}} an aphasia, a disorder of language, and {{is not to be}} confused with <b>speech</b> disorders, <b>as</b> there is no difficulty in the formation of internal speech. Palilalia is similar to <b>speech</b> disorders such <b>as</b> stuttering or cluttering, as it tends to only express itself in spontaneous <b>speech,</b> such <b>as</b> answering basic questions, and not in automatic <b>speech</b> such <b>as</b> reading or singing; however, it distinctively affects words and phrases rather than syllables and sounds.|$|R

5|$|Three United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} in 1919 each upheld convictions under laws against {{certain kinds of}} anti-war speech. In 1919, the Court upheld the conviction of Socialist Party leader Charles Schenck for publishing anti-war literature. In Debs v. United States, the court upheld the conviction of Eugene Debs. While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in Abrams v. United States, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote an important dissent which has gradually been absorbed as an American principle: he urged the court to treat freedom of <b>speech</b> <b>as</b> a fundamental right, which should rarely be restricted.|$|E
5|$|Although McKinley enjoyed {{meeting the}} public, Cortelyou was {{concerned}} with his security due to recent assassinations by anarchists in Europe, such as the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy the previous year, and twice tried to remove a public reception from the President's rescheduled visit to the Exposition. McKinley refused, and Cortelyou arranged for additional security for the trip. On September 5, the President delivered his address at the fairgrounds, before a crowd of some 50,000 people. In his final speech, McKinley urged reciprocity treaties with other nations to assure American manufacturers access to foreign markets. He intended the <b>speech</b> <b>as</b> a keynote to his plans for a second term.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale used Mitică as a stock {{character}} to feature in satirical contexts; the biographical insights he provided are short and often contradict each other. Among Mitică's traits are his tendency to generate sarcastic comebacks and sententious catchphrases, a Francized <b>speech,</b> <b>as</b> well as inclinations {{to waste time}} and easily find {{his way out of}} problematic situations. His existence is connected to events in the history of Bucharest which he occasionally references in his jokes. Like Lache and Mache, who are present in Caragiale's fiction, the character is usually portrayed as a civil servant who has a hard time making ends meet, but who is well liked by his peers.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Nesbitt {{appeared}} in Wall of Silence, a fact-based drama about {{the aftermath of}} the murder of schoolboy Jamie Robe. Nesbitt played Stuart Robe, the boy's father, who tries to break down the wall of silence in the local community to discover exactly what happened to his son. He had only just completed Bloody Sunday when he was offered the part and was unsure whether he wanted to take on such a demanding role so soon after playing Ivan Cooper. He decided to accept the part because he found it interesting. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Robe and spent weeks talking to him in his South London flat, learning about Jamie, and of Robe's fight for his justice. Nesbitt spoke with his natural accent instead of affecting Robe's South London <b>speech,</b> <b>as</b> he did not want the audience to be distracted from the drama. The single-drama was filmed over four weeks and broadcast in January 2004. The role gained Nesbitt an IFTA nomination for Best Actor in a TV Drama later that year.|$|E
5|$|It {{was widely}} {{believed}} that George would dismiss Walpole, who had distressed him by joining his father's government, and replace him with Sir Spencer Compton. George asked Compton, rather than Walpole, {{to write his}} first <b>speech</b> <b>as</b> king for him, but Compton asked Walpole to draft it. Caroline advised George to retain Walpole, who continued to gain royal favour by securing a generous civil list (a fixed annual amount set by Parliament for the king's official expenditure) of £800,000. Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George {{had little choice but}} to retain him or risk ministerial instability. Compton was ennobled as Lord Wilmington the following year.|$|E
5|$|Russell replaces Mill's {{analysis}} with {{an examination of}} the issue from four perspectives: the perspective of the governor, the citizen, the innovator, and the philosopher. The rational governor is always threatened by revolutionary activities, and can always be expected to ban speech which calls for assassination. Yet the governor would be advised to allow freedom of speech to prevent and diminish discontent among the subjects, and has no reason to suppress ideas which are unrelated to his governance, for instance the Copernican doctrine of heliocentrism. Relatedly, the citizen mainly understands free <b>speech</b> <b>as</b> an extension of the right to do peaceably that which could only otherwise be done through violence (Russell 1938:179–182).|$|E
