5|$|Two days later, Tuesday 23 February, Gothenburg passed Cooktown {{at about}} 2:00pm. The {{wind and rain}} {{severely}} increased and cloud cover became <b>so</b> <b>thick</b> it blocked out the sun. Despite this, she continued the journey south into worsening weather, in a deep water passage between the North Queensland coastline and the Great Barrier Reef, known as the inner route. Although taking this route provided some protection from the open sea, captains had to navigate and thread {{their way through a}} number of then uncharted reefs. All passengers and crew expected to be in Newcastle on Sunday evening for a scheduled stopover.|$|E

50|$|Core shroud {{walls are}} {{relatively}} thin, ranging {{from three to}} five centimeters in thickness. This is because the core shroud is not built to withstand high amounts of pressure {{for long periods of}} time, <b>so</b> <b>thicker</b> walls would be unnecessary for the core shroud's function.|$|R
50|$|Ideally, {{the ring}} circuit acts like two radial {{circuits}} proceeding {{in opposite directions}} around the ring, the dividing point between them dependent {{on the distribution of}} load in the ring. If the load is evenly split across the two directions, the current in each direction is half of the total, allowing the use of wire with half the total current-carrying capacity. In practice, the load does not always split evenly, <b>so</b> <b>thicker</b> wire is used.|$|R

25|$|A.resiliens resembles {{several of}} its congeners; in particular, it belongs to a group {{comprising}} varicolored spleenwort (A.heterochroum), A.nesioticum, and A.palmeri, as well as A.resiliens. The {{members of this group}} all share dark, lustrous stipes and lack prominent hydathodes {{on the surface of the}} blade, the latter characteristic distinguishing them from single-sorus spleenwort (A.monanthes) and others. Among the group, A.resiliens has a slightly more leathery leaf texture than the rest, lacks distinct teeth on the pinna margins, and tends to have once-forked, rather than simple, fertile veins. Stolze noted that specimens with leaf texture <b>so</b> <b>thick</b> as to obscure the veins may be identified as A.resiliens, as A.heterochroum and A.palmeri very rarely become this leathery.|$|E
25|$|River North was {{previously}} named Smokey Hollow, {{at the turn}} of the 20th century, due to the many factories and forges in the area. Smoke from the factories was often <b>so</b> <b>thick</b> that it blocked the sunlight. At the time, Smokey Hollow was a major transportation hub, with railroad tracks linking the ports along the Chicago River to the surrounding areas. The now mixed-use Merchandise Mart was once a major storage warehouse for goods, and it still has railroad tracks underneath its sprawling structure. Former major retailer Montgomery Ward also had a major transportation and storage facility in River North. Massive coal bins were formerly located throughout the neighborhood, for storage of coal transported by ship.|$|E

25|$|Treatment {{may involve}} {{one or more}} of the following: chemotherapy, {{radiation}} therapy, targeted therapy, and surgery. In some non-Hodgkin lymphomas, an increased amount of protein produced by the lymphoma cells causes the blood to become <b>so</b> <b>thick</b> that plasmapheresis is performed to remove the protein. Watchful waiting may be appropriate for certain types. The outcome depends on the subtype with some being curable and treatment prolonging survival in most. The five-year survival rate in the United States for all Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes is 85%, while that for non-Hodgkin lymphomas is 69%. Worldwide, lymphomas developed in 566,000 people in 2012 and caused 305,000 deaths. They make up 3â€“4% of all cancers, making them as a group the seventh-most common form. In children, they are the third-most common cancer. They occur more often in the developed world than the developing world.|$|E
25|$|Silversides {{became a}} part of the Combined Great Lakes Navy Association in Chicago, Illinois, behind Chicago's Naval Armory on 24 May 1973. For years, the {{submarine}} was tended by a small crew of dedicated volunteers, drawn to her illustrious history and technical marvels. They donated tens of thousands of man-hours to restore her, maintained her at their own expense, and served as docents and chaperones. When association volunteers first stepped on board, they faced a musty, mildewed sub with paint peeling off in sheets inside and out, and junk scattered everywhere. After many years, the refrigeration compartment had produced a growth <b>so</b> <b>thick,</b> they could be measured in multiple inches instead of millimeters. Evidence of water damage prevailed in the forward compartments but the aft end was in reasonably good condition. Topside, the decking was weathered and worn in spots and some areas of the superstructure were rusted and in need of replacement.|$|E
25|$|Light-emitting {{phosphors}} {{are applied}} as a paint-like coating {{to the inside}} of the tube. The organic solvents are allowed to evaporate, then the tube is heated to nearly the melting point of glass to drive off remaining organic compounds and fuse the coating to the lamp tube. Careful control of the grain size of the suspended phosphors is necessary; large grains, 35 micrometers or larger, lead to weak grainy coatings, whereas too many small particles 1 or 2 micrometers or smaller leads to poor light maintenance and efficiency. Most phosphors perform best with a particle size around 10 micrometers. The coating must be thick enough to capture all the ultraviolet light produced by the mercury arc, but not <b>so</b> <b>thick</b> that the phosphor coating absorbs too much visible light. The first phosphors were synthetic versions of naturally occurring fluorescent minerals, with small amounts of metals added as activators. Later other compounds were discovered, allowing differing colors of lamps to be made.|$|E

25|$|Once a {{situation}} has been noticed, {{in order for}} a bystander to intervene they must interpret the incident as an emergency. According to the principle of social influence, bystanders monitor the reactions of other people in an emergency situation to see if others think {{that it is necessary to}} intervene. If it is determined that others are not reacting to the situation, bystanders will interpret the situation as not an emergency and will not intervene. This is an example of pluralistic ignorance or social proof. Referring to the smoke experiment, even though students in the groups had clearly noticed the smoke which had become <b>so</b> <b>thick</b> that it was obscuring their vision, irritating their eyes or causing them to cough, they were still unlikely to report it. Only one participant in the group condition reported the smoke within the first four minutes, and by the end of the experiment, no-one from five of eight groups had reported the smoke at all. In the groups that did not report the smoke, the interpretations of its cause, and the likelihood that it was genuinely threatening was also less serious, with no-one suggesting fire as a possible cause, but some preferring less serious explanations, such as the air-conditioner was leaking.|$|E

50|$|Smoothies include {{dietary fiber}} (e.g. pulp, often also skin and seeds) and <b>so</b> are <b>thicker</b> than fruit juice, with a {{consistency}} {{similar to a}} milkshake. The fiber makes smoothies more healthful than fruit juice alone. Smoothiesâ€”particularly green smoothies (which include vegetables)â€”are often marketed to health-conscious people, for example as a healthier alternative to milkshakes.|$|R

The chromatin patterns are well visible, the cells from borderline lesions are easier to interpret and the photomicrographs are better. The staining results in very transparent cells, <b>so</b> even <b>thicker</b> specimens with overlapping cells can be interpreted.|$|R
500|$|The canal {{would often}} freeze in winter, so an {{icebreaker}} {{was used to}} ensure the canal remained navigable during the cold weather. [...] Named [...] "Sarah Lansdale" [...] and owned by James Crompton Paperworks, it was towed {{by a team of}} horses while the crew stood astride the deck, secured to the handrails, rocking the boat from side to side and breaking the ice in the process.

He conducted amateur ensembles and was organist of the Union Chapel, Islington. In the latter capacity he wrote several pieces for the choir during 1910 and 1911, and his symphonic poem Night on the Mountains was played at the Queen's Hall by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Harrison at the invitation of Hans Richter. The Times said, [...] "The orchestral colouring is laid on with <b>so</b> <b>thick</b> a brush that the outlines get somewhat obscured in places, but it still contains some promising ideas".|$|E

Several reviewers were {{critical}} of Snatch; however, most praised Pitt. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said Pitt was [...] "ideally cast as an Irishman whose accent is <b>so</b> <b>thick</b> even Brits can't understand him", {{going on to}} say that, before Snatch, Pitt had been [...] "shackled by roles that called for brooding introspection, but recently he has found his calling in black comic outrageousness and flashy extroversion;" [...] while Amy Taubin of The Village Voice claimed that [...] "Pitt gets maximum comic mileage out of a one-joke role".|$|E

5|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Venus {{is composed of}} 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen, and traces of other gases, most notably sulfur dioxide. The amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere is relatively small compared {{to the amount of}} carbon dioxide, but because the atmosphere is <b>so</b> much <b>thicker</b> than that on Earth, its total nitrogen content is roughly four times higher than Earth's, even though on Earth nitrogen makes up about 78% of the atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|In both {{ring and}} radial circuits, the circuit wiring starts at a {{consumer}} unit or distribution board, traverses in turn {{a number of}} sockets or devices (point-to-point style), before terminating. The difference is that a radial circuit simply ends upon reaching the last connected device, while in a ring circuit the termination is made by rejoining {{the end of the}} circuit from the last device back to its starting point. A ring circuit therefore forms a continuous ring. This means that there are two independent paths from the supply to every device. Ideally, the ring acts like two radial circuits proceeding in opposite directions around the ring, the dividing point between them dependent on the distribution of load in the ring. If the load is evenly split across the two directions, the current in each direction is half of the total, allowing the use of wire with half the current-carrying capacity. (Because heating effects are proportional to the square of the current, this means the cable theoretically only needs to be quarter of the usual cross section area, for the same current carrying capacity). In practice, the load does not always split evenly, <b>so</b> <b>thicker</b> wire is used.|$|R
500|$|American {{political}} scientist Mark Cooper asserted that Nasser's charisma and his direct {{relationship with the}} Egyptian people [...] "rendered intermediaries (organizations and individuals) unnecessary". He opined that Nasser's legacy was a [...] "guarantee of instability" [...] due to Nasser's reliance on personal power {{and the absence of}} strong political institutions under his rule. Historian Abd al-Azim Ramadan wrote that Nasser was an irrational and irresponsible leader, blaming his inclination to solitary decision-making for Egypt's losses during the Suez War, among other events. Miles Copeland, Jr., a Central Intelligence Agency officer known for his close personal relationship with Nasser, said that the barriers between Nasser and the outside world have grown <b>so</b> <b>thick</b> that all but the information that attest to his infallibility, indispensability, and immortality has been filtered out.|$|E
500|$|The {{glow from}} the burning, and the news {{spreading}} quickly round London, ensured that crowds continued to turn up in increasing numbers to watch the spectacle.

[...] The crowds were <b>so</b> <b>thick</b> that they blocked Westminster Bridge {{in their attempts to}} get a good view, and many took to the river in whatever craft they could find or hire in order to watch better. A crowd of thousands congregated in Parliament Square to witness the spectacle, including the Prime Ministerâ€”Lord Melbourneâ€”and many of his cabinet. Thomas Carlyle, the Scottish philosopher, was one of those present that night, and he later recalled that: ...|$|E
500|$|Flows from Hawaiian eruptions are basaltic, and can {{be divided}} into two types by their {{structural}} characteristics. Pahoehoe lava is a relatively smooth lava flow that can be billowy or ropey. They can move as one sheet, by the advancement of [...] "toes," [...] or as a snaking lava column. A'a lava flows are denser and more viscous than pahoehoe, and tend to move slower. Flows can measure [...] thick. A'a flows are <b>so</b> <b>thick</b> that the outside layers cools into a rubble-like mass, insulating the still-hot interior and preventing it from cooling. A'a lava moves in a peculiar wayâ€”the front of the flow steepens due to pressure from behind until it breaks off, after which the general mass behind it moves forward. Pahoehoe lava can sometimes become A'a lava due to increasing viscosity or increasing rate of shear, but A'a lava never turns into pahoehoe flow.|$|E
5000|$|For making jump rings, 10- to 18-gauge wire (2.5 to 1.3 mm) is used. Bracelet and {{necklace}} wire {{components are}} generally {{made out of}} wire that is 16-, 18- or 20-gauge (1.3 to 0.8 mm). Earring wires are usually made out of 18- or 20-gauge wire (1.0 to 0.8 mm). When making wire wrapped jewelry, these components are connected to one another with wire that is generally 20- to 26-gauge (0.8 to 0.4 mm). Frequently the connections between wire components will include a bead on the wire connector in a technique called a wire-wrapped loop. Most glass beads (but not all) are manufactured with a hole that is 1 mm in size. This will accommodate 20-gauge wire, but will probably not accommodate 18-gauge wire. Some glass beads, almost all freshwater pearls and some gemstone beads will have smaller holes and will {{require the use of}} wire thinner than 20-gauge. (The largest wire that can go through the beads is generally chosen. Beads and gemstones are much harder than the wire, and will over time saw into the wire; <b>so</b> <b>thicker</b> wire will last longer.) ...|$|R
