PM emission was considered that it consisted of coarse and aggregate particles, and nuclei-mode particles of which diameter was less than 50 nm. However the detail characteristics about these particles of the PM were still unknown and they were needed for more physically accurate measurement and more effective reduction of exhaust PM emission. In this study, the size distributions of solid particles in PM emission were reported. PMs in the tail-pipe emission were sampled from three type diesel engines. Sampled PM was chemically treated to separate the solid carbon fraction from other fractions such as soluble organic fraction (SOF).

40|$|Line-start {{incremental}} centrifugal liquid sedimentation (disc-CLS) is {{a powerful}} method to determine particle size based {{on the principles of}} Stokes’ law. Because several of the input quantities of the Stokes equation cannot be easily determined for this case of a rotating disc, the disc-CLS approach relies on calibrating the sedimentation time scale with reference particles. To use these calibrant particles for establishing metrological traceability, they must fulfill the same requirements as those imposed on a certified reference material, i. e., their certified <b>Stokes</b> <b>diameter</b> and density value must come with a realistic measurement uncertainty and with a traceability statement. As is the case for several other techniques, the calibrants do not always come with uncertainties for the assigned modal diameter and effective particle density. The lack of such information and the absence of a traceability statement make it difficult for the end-user to estimate the uncertainty of the measurement results and to compare them with results obtained by others. We present the results of a collaborative study that aimed at demonstrating the traceability of particle size results obtained with disc-CLS. For this purpose, the particle size and effective particle density of polyvinyl chloride calibrants were measured using different validated methods, and measurement uncertainties were estimated according to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement. The results indicate that the modal <b>Stokes</b> <b>diameter</b> and effective particle density that are assigned to the calibrants are accurate within 5 % and 3. 5 %, respectively, and that they can be used to establish traceability of particle size results obtained with disc-CLS. This conclusion has a great impact on the traceability statement of certified particle size reference materials, for which the traceability is limited to the size and density values of the calibrant particles.

40|$|The Author(s) 2013. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract One of the subfractions of HDL involved in reverse cholesterol transport is c-LpE. It has been assumed that, like preb-LpAI, {{it can be}} generated during the inter-action between phosphatidylcholine liposomes and lipo-proteins and can contribute to more efficient cholesterol efflux after the introduction of liposomes to plasma. However, {{there has been no}} evidence concerning what the sources of these particles in plasma might be. Here, we determined whether the interaction of phosphatidylcholine liposomes with VLDL and the subsequent conversions of particles could be a source of new c-LpE particles. We found that the interaction between liposomes and VLDL affected its lipid and protein composition. The content of phospholipids increased (* 96 %) while the content of free cholesterol and apolipoprotein E decreased in VLDL dur-ing the reaction with liposomes (* 100 and * 24 %, respectively). New particles which did not contain apoli-poprotein B were generated. Heterogeneous HDL-sized populations of particles were generated, containing phos-pholipids and apolipoprotein E as the sole apolipoprotein, with densities from 1. 063 to 1. 21 g/ml, either with c-mobility on agarose gel and <b>Stokes</b> <b>diameters</b> from 8. 58 to 22. 07 nm or with preb-mobility and <b>Stokes</b> <b>diameters</b> from 9. 9 to 21. 08 nm.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{proposed that}} the N-terminal 1000 residue {beta}{alpha}{sub 1 } domain of apolipoprotein B (apoB) forms a bulk lipid pocket homologous to that of lamprey lipovitellin (LV). In support of this ''lipid pocket'' hypothesis, apoB: 1000 (residues 1 - 1000) was shown to be secreted by a stable transformant of McA-RH 7777 cells as a monodisperse particle with HDL{sub 3 } density and <b>Stokes</b> <b>diameter</b> of 112 {angstrom}. In contrast, apoB: 931 (residues 1 - 931), missing only 69 residues of the sequence homologous to LV, was secreted as a particle considerably more dense than HDL with <b>Stokes</b> <b>diameter</b> of 110 {angstrom}. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine the stoichiometry of the lipid component of the apoB: 931 and apoB: 1000 particles. This was accomplished by metabolic labeling of cells with either [{sup 14 }C]oleic acid or [{sup 3 }H]glycerol followed by immunoprecipitation (IP) or nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (NDGGE) of secreted lipoproteins and by immunoaffinity chromatography of secreted unlabeled lipoproteins. The [{sup 3 }H]-labeled apoB: 1000 -containing particles, isolated by NDGGE, contained 50 phospholipids (PL) and 11 triacylglycerols (TAG) molecules per particle. In contrast, apoB: 931 -containing particles contained only a few molecules of PL and were devoid of TAG. The unlabeled apoB: 1000 -containing particles isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography and analyzed for lipid mass, contained 56 PL, 8 TAG, and 7 cholesteryl ester molecules per particle. The surface:core lipid ratio of apoB: 1000 -containing particles was approximately 4 : 1 and was not affected by incubation of cells with oleate. Although small amounts of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) were associated with apoB: 1000 -containing particles, it never approached a 1 : 1 molar ratio of MTP to apoB. These results support a model in which: (1) the first 1000 amino acid residues of apoB are competent to complete the ''lipid pocket'' without a structural requirement for MTP; (2) amino acids between 931 to 1000 of apoB- 100 are critical for the formation of a nascent lipoprotein particle, and (3) the ''lipid pocket'' created by the first 1000 amino acid residues of apoB- 100 is PL-rich, suggesting a small bilayer type organization and has a maximum capacity on the order of 70 molecules of lipid.

The 34 -yr-old proband, product of a consanguineous marriage, had bilateral retinopathy, bilateral cataracts, spinocerebellar ataxia, and tendon xanthomata. High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was < 0. 1 mM and apoA-I was undetectable. Genomic DNA sequencing of the proband's apoA-I gene identified a nonsense mutation at codon [- 2], which we designate as Q[- 2]X. This mutation causes a loss of endonuclease digestion sites for both BbvI and Fnu 4 HI. Genotyping identified four additional homozygotes, four heterozygotes, and two unaffected subjects among the first-degree relatives. Q[- 2]X homozygosity causes a selective failure to produce any portion of mature apoA-I, resulting in very low plasma level of HDL. Heterozygosity results in approximately half-normal apoA-I and HDL.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of the charge distribution in laboratory generated aerosols particles was carried out. Four cases of electrostatic charge acquisition by aerosol particles were evaluated. In two of these cases. the charges acquired by the particles were naturally derived from the aerosol generation procedure itself, without using any additional charging method. Ill the other two cases, a corona charger and an impact charger were utilized as Supplementary methods for charge generation. Two types of aerosol generators {{were used in the}} dispersion of particles in the gas Stream: the vibrating orifice generator TSI model 3450 and the rotating plate generator TSI model 3433. In the vibrating orifice generator. a Solution of methylene blue Was used and the generated particles were mono-dispersed. Different mono-aerosols were generated with particle diameters varying from 6. 0 x 10 (- 6) m to 1. 4 x 10 (- 5) m. In the rotating plate generator, a poly-dispersed phosphate rock concentrate with <b>Stokes</b> mean <b>diameter</b> of 1. 30 x 10 (- 6) m and size range between 1. 5 x 10 (- 7) m and 8. 0 x 10 (- 6) m Was utilized as powder material in all tests. In the tests performed with the mono-dispersed particles. the median charges of the particles varied between - 3. 0 x 10 -(16) C and - 5. 0 x 10 (- 18) degrees C and a weak dependence between particle size and charge was observed. The particles were predominantly negatively charged. In the tests with the poly-dispersed particles the median charges varied fairly linearly with the particle diameter and were negative. The order of magnitude of the results obtained is in accordance with data reported in the literature. The charge distribution, in this case, was wider, so that an appreciable amount of particles were positively charged. The relative spread of the distribution varied with the charging method. It was also noticed that the corona charger acted very effectively in charging the particles. (C) 2008 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved. FAPESPFAPEMIGCNP...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the growing}} {{interest}} in nanofiltration for industrial use, a better insight in the retention mechanisms in nanofiltration is needed, which {{will make it possible}} to understand membrane performances for specific applications. In this paper, the retention of a series of organic molecules by four nanofiltration membranes was studied. The membranes that were used are NF 70 (Dow/FilmTec), NTR 7450 (Nitto-Denko), UTC- 20 (Toray Ind.) and Zirfon(R) (VITO). In order to correlate the retention with the size of the molecule, which is the main factor that determines the retention, use was made of different parameters for the molecular size: molecular weight, the <b>Stokes</b> <b>diameter,</b> the equivalent molar diameter, and a diameter obtained with energy minimisation calculations. For each size parameter, the correlation with retention in nanofiltration experiments was calculated. For the Zirfon(R) membrane, retentions were too low to obtain a good correlation.

Two other factors were found to have an influence on retention of organic molecules: the polarity of the molecule, and the charge of the molecule.

40|$|AbstractApolipoprotein E (apoE) plays a {{major role}} in the {{transport}} and metabolism of lipid by acting as a ligand for low density lipoprotein-receptors. The amphipathic helical regions of its C-terminal domain are necessary for the lipoprotein binding and assembly of nascent lipoprotein particles. Lipoproteins in the plasma are known to possess a net negative charge, determined by both its protein and lipid components, which regulates the metabolism of lipoproteins. The role of membrane surface charge on the interaction of apoE has not been studied previously. Also the importance of individual amphipathic helical regions of its C-terminal domain in binding to negatively charged lipid membrane is not addressed. In this study we have compared the interaction of four peptide segments of apoE C-terminal domain (apoE(202 – 223), apoE(223 – 244), apoE(245 – 266), and apoE(268 – 289)) with zwitterionic and negatively charged model membranes by employing UV–visible and fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and native PAGE analysis. Our results show that the peptide sequence 202 – 223, 245 – 266 and 268 – 289 of apoE has higher affinity towards negatively charged lipid membrane and are independently capable of forming lipoprotein particles of 17 ± 2  nm <b>Stokes</b> <b>diameter.</b> The results suggest that surface charge of lipoprotein regulates its metabolism possibly by modulating the recruitment of apoE on its surface...|$|E

To reveal the effect of lipid composition on their formation and characteristics, we prepared several reconstituted HDLs (rHDLs) with 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (POPC), 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoserine (POPS), 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine (POPE), and sphingomyelin at phospholipid to apolipoprotein A-I ratios of 100 and 25. When reconstitution was conducted at 37 °C, the efficiency of rHDL formation from POPC was decreased as compared with that conducted at 4 °C. Moreover, large rHDLs with a <b>Stokes</b> <b>diameter</b> of 9. 6 nm became dominant over small rHDL with a diameter of 7. 9 nm, which was distinctly observed at 4 °C. The aminophospholipids POPS and POPE promoted the formation of small rHDLs at 37 °C, but fluorescence experiments revealed that they did so in a different fashion: Fluorescence lifetime data suggested that the head group of POPS reduces hydrophobic hydration, especially in small rHDLs, suggesting that this lipid stabilizes the saddle-shaped bilayer structure in small rHDLs. Fluorescence lifetime and anisotropy data showed that incorporation of POPE increases acyl chain order and water penetration into the head group region in large rHDLs, suggesting that POPE destabilizes the planar bilayer structure. These results imply that these aminophospholipids contribute {{to the formation of}} small rHDLs under biological conditions...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} a {{magnetic}} recording media dispersion {{has been carried out}} using hindered settling analysis, the purpose of which was to probe the equilibrium state structure in zero applied magnetic field. The system chosen for the main study was based on a commercial formulation of a #gamma#-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 suspension of 0. 3 #mu#m length acicular particles, with aspect ratio 5 : 1, that was used to manufacture a back-up/archive tape. From the sedimentation analysis, a large fraction of fluid (#approx# 86 % by volume of the settling unit) was estimated to be trapped within the clusters of particles that make-up the overall dispersion structure. Confidence in the result was given by correction of the classical hindered settling models to account for the trapped fluid. In this manner, the range of Steinour and Kozeny-Carman parameters evaluated reduced near to, or agreed with, the fundamental values found by the original authors on simple model systems that contained little to no trapped fluid. Near- Newtonian fluid measurements resulted in an equivalent <b>Stokes</b> particle <b>diameter</b> of #approx# 6. 7 #mu#m. A computer simulation of hindered settling has been developed, based on a laminae concept and the Kozeny-Carman equation, in order to complement the experimental investigation. The concentration profiles over column height compared well with those obtained using a scanning column magnetometer to give an enhanced description of the hindered settling phenomena. This showed that the descending 'plug' of constant solids concentration falls down into, and is continually subsumed by, the rising layers of the lower compression region. The plug effectively contracts about its mid-point and the initial constant rate of fall is only maintained up {{to the point where the}} plug is destroyed. It was also found that the model only gave a reasonable comparison with experiment when the effective ratio of trapped fluid was large; giving further confidence in the trapped fluid estimate. The theory of the scanning column magnetometer technique has been developed beyond that already known. This resulted in good agreement between theory and experiment in characterising the main detection coil response, or 'form factor' and means that future design work will be enhanced. The effects of magnetic interaction in the magnetic media dispersion have been investigated by varying the magnetic #gamma#-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 content by dilution with #alpha#-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 (produced from the same particles) whilst holding the total particle concentration constant. The resultant increase in sedimentation with magnetic interactions has been interpreted in terms of hindered settling theory as being due to the formation of clusters by magnetostatic attraction. Extension of the experiment should give a strong indication of the extent that magnetic particles trap fluid in comparison to their non-magnetic depletion flocculated precursor. This could be significant in the context of the drying stage of the magnetic recording media production process.

Furthermore, zeolite channel diameters are close to molecule diameters, which results in strong van der Waals interaction. MOR 200 and ZSM 5, the two most hydrophobic zeolites, showed the highest removal of neutral nitrosamines in demineralised water, with higher efficacy than activated carbon. DAY and MOR 30, which were relatively hydrophilic zeolites, did not show appreciable removal of any of the nitrosamines. When nitrosamines were adsorbed from surface water, there was no influence of competition with, or pore blockage by, NOM components on nitrosamine removal for ZSM 5 zeolite, in contrast to activated carbon. Repulsion of negatively charged pharmaceuticals was significant for ZSM 5, which had a Si/Al ratio of 80. MOR 200 had a Si/Al ratio of 200, indicating a lower Al content than ZSM 5 and, as such, a lower negative surface charge. Charge effects were not observed for MOR 200. A relationship was found between the <b>Stokes</b> <b>diameter</b> of the pharmaceuticals and nitrosamines, and their removal by ZSM 5 and MOR 200, indicating that a "close fit" adsorption mechanism is more likely than hydrophobic interaction in these zeolites. Due to their selective nature, adsorption on zeolites should only be considered as an additional treatment step to existing processes, dedicated for the removal of specific organic micropollutants. Less specific treatment techniques, such as activated carbon filtration, are still required to ensure a broad barrier for organic micropollutants in water treatment. © 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Apolipoprotein C-III {{is a major}} protein {{constituent}} of triglyceride rich lipoproteins and HDL. It {{occurs in}} plasma in three isoforms differing by their sialic acid content. Apo C-III putatively inhibits lipolysis and the apo E mediated hepatic uptake of remnants from triglyceride rich particles. We identified a heterozygous carrier of an apolipoprotein C-III variant {{by the presence of}} additional bands after isoelectric focusing (IEF) of VLDL. Structural analysis of the variant protein by HPLC, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and automated gas phase sequencing revealed a lysine to glutamic acid replacement in position 58. The underlying A to G exchange was verified by direct sequencing subsequent to amplification by polymerase chain reaction of exon 4 of the apo C-III gene. Family studies revealed vertical transmission of this defect. The two variant carriers exhibited plasma concentrations of HDL cholesterol and apo A-I above the 95 th percentiles of sex matched controls whereas the unaffected father and sister showed normal values. The plasma concentrations of apo C-III in the two variant carriers were decreased by 30 - 40 % compared with those of the two unaffected family members and to random controls. Using two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis as well as IEF and subsequent scanning densitometry, we found that the low serum concentration of apo C-III was a consequence of diminished concentrations of the variant apo C-III isoproteins in both VLDL (15 % of normal) and HDL (25 % of normal). Apo C-III(Lys 58 [...] Glu) heterozygotes possessed unusual HDL as demonstrated by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. They consisted mainly of HDL 2 b and contained a proportion of atypically large particles, enriched in apo E, with a <b>Stokes</b> <b>diameter</b> of 13 - 18 nm and resembling HDLc. In conclusion, heterozygosity for a structural apo C-III variant [...] apo C-III(Lys 58 [...] Glu) [...] was identified in two hyperalphalipoproteinemic subjects characterized by the presence of low plasma apo C-III concentrations and atypically large HDL...|$|E
40|$|Nanotiltration is a {{membrane}} separation method {{known for its}} special characteristic of rejecting multivalent ions and passing monovalent ions. Thus, it is commonly applied with dilute aqueous solutions in partial salt removal, like in drinking water production. The possibilities of nanofiltration have been studied and the technique applied in a wide branch of industries, e. g. the pulp and paper, the textile and the chemical processing industry. However, most present applications {{and most of the}} potential applications studied involve dilute solutions, the permeating stream being generally water containing monovalent salts. In this study nanotiltration is investigated more as a fractionation method. A well-known application in the dairy industry is concentration and partial salt removal from whey. Concentration and partial demineralization is beneficial for futher processing of whey as whey concentrates are used e. g. in baby foods. In the experiments of this study nanotiltration effectively reduced the monovalent salts in the whey concentrate. The main concern in this application is lactose leakage into the permeate. With the nanofiltration membranes used the lactose retentions were practically ? 99 %. Another dairy application studied was the purification and reuse of cleaning solutions. This is an environmentally driven application. An 80 % COD reduction by nanofiltration was observed for alkaline cleaning-in-place solution. Nanofiltration is not as commonly applied in the sugar and sweeteners industry as in the dairy industry. In this study one potential application was investigated, namely xylose purification from hemicellulose hydrolyzate. Xylose is raw material for xylitol production. Xylose separation from glucose was initially studied with xylose-glucose model solutions. The ability of nanofiltration to partially separate xylose into the permeate from rather concentrated xylose-glucose solutions (10 w-% and 30 w-%) became evident. The difference in size between xylose and glucose molecules according to any size measure is small, e. g. the <b>Stokes</b> <b>diameter</b> of glucose is 0. 73 nm compared to 0. 65 nm for xylose. In further experiments, xylose was purified into nanoliltration permeate from a hemicellulose hydrolyzate solution. The xylose content in the total solids was increased by 1. 4 — 1. 7 fold depending on temperature, pressure and feed composition...|$|E
40|$|The {{particle}} size distribution and mean {{particle size}} {{are the most important}} characteristics in particulate or powder technology. Various approaches have been used to measure {{particle size distribution}}s. For solid-liquid systems, the particle size distributions have been measured by the <b>Stokes</b> <b>diameter.</b> The Andreasen pipette method, sedimentation balance method, centrifugal sedimentation method, etc. have been used to measure the particle size distribution in suspensions. These methods measure the migration velocities of particles in solution, and then particle size is calculated using Stokes formula. However, all these methods are time consuming and require special skills. On the other hand, a different principle can be used to analyze the particle size distribution through microscopy, laser diffraction/scattering method, and a Coulter counter method. These methods require numerous samples to accurately determine the particle size distribution. Although the laser diffraction/scattering and Coulter counter methods produce highly accurate results within a shorter time, they require extremely expensive equipment. Hence, a simple and cost effective method to determine the particle size distribution is highly demanded. The investigation of particle size distributions by the buoyancy weighing-bar method which is a novel method in particle size distribution measurement have been done for several samples particles of Japan Industrial Standard (Test Powders 1 and Test Powders 2), Sumitomo 3 M (glass beads K 1, K 37, S 60 HS), polystyrene beads (spherical), nylon beads (cylindrical), etc. The influence of solid concentration, influence of shape and size of weighing bar and influence of vessel size also had been investigated in particle size distribution measurement by the buoyancy weighing-bar method. The result data obtained by the buoyancy weighing-bar method were comparable with the others particle size analyzer, such as sedimentation balance method, Andreasen pipette method, Coulter counter method, microscopy and the laser diffraction/scattering method. The buoyancy weighing-bar method is suitable for measuring the settling particle size distribution and the floating particle size distribution. The buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to measure the particle size distribution in Stokes region and in Allen region. The particle size distribution obtained by the buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to estimate the smaller particle size by using the Rosin-Rammler distribution. Theory was rediscussed and the new mean particle size was defined. Beside, the buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to determine the mean particle sizes for a ternary mixture and multi-component particles in a short time. This ability is very useful in the powder industry. Similar to other methods to analyze particle size, the buoyancy weighing-bar method is accurate in an initially homogeneous suspension. Because the buoyancy weighing-bar method apparatus can be made by hand, it is also economical. Additionally, the buoyancy weighing-bar method is easier to be implemented compared to other sedimentation particle analysis methods. 室蘭工業大学 (Muroran Institute of Technology) 博士（工学...|$|E
40|$|Ce travail explore les {{performances}} de deux types de membranes de nanofiltration (Desal DK et NF 200) dans l'élimination dans les eaux de certains pesticides (l'atrazine et son métabolite la déséthylatrazine (DEA), la simazine, la cyanazine, l'isoproturon et le diuron) et évalue l'influence de la présence de matière organique ou inorganique dans la matrice d'eau sur l'efficacité de ce traitement. Des eaux synthétiques, composées à partir d'eau distillée à laquelle a été ajoutée de la matière organique (acides humiques) ou inorganique (CaCl 2 ou CaSO 4), ont été traitées sur un pilote de nanofiltration durant 96 heures. Les taux rétention en pesticides et ceux de leur adsorption sur les membranes ont été calculés et comparés aux résultats obtenus sur une matrice d'eau distillée pure. Une influence du type de membrane et de la présence de la matière humique sur le taux d'abattement de certains pesticides a été constatée. L'influence de la matière inorganique est pratiquement insignifiante. The {{intensive use}} of pesticides in agriculture {{has resulted in the}} contamination of groundwater and surface waters. The removal of these organic pollutants by the usual methods such as adsorption by activated carbon (in powdered or granular form) or oxidation by ozone have some disadvantages. Recently, the removal of organic pollutants by membrane retention (reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration and nanofiltration) has become increasingly popular and due to its low cost, nanofiltration has become an interesting option. This study examined the efficiency of two different nanofiltration membranes (Desal DK and NF 200) in the removal of some pesticides (atrazine and its metabolite desethylatrazine (DEA), simazine, cyanazine, isoproturon and diuron) from water and, in addition, investigated the influence that organic and inorganic matter may have on the efficiency of this removal. Synthetic waters were made from distilled water and organic matter (humic acids) or inorganic matter (CaCl 2 or CaSO 4) was added, as well as 1 µg/l of each pesticide. The samples were then filtered by a nanofiltration pilot for 96 hours. Samples of the feed, permeate and the retentate were taken after 4, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. The samples were replaced with equivalent volumes of the original solution in the feed tank. The different samples were analysed by an on-line SPE / HPLC system. The different concentrations obtained allowed the determination of the proportion of the pesticides that adsorbed to the membrane. The removal efficiency of pesticides from pure distilled water differed according to the membrane. For example, the Desal DK membrane eliminated more than 90 % of all the pesticides (with the exception of diuron). In contrast, the NF 200 membrane, eliminated more than 75 % of all the pesticides (with the exception of diuron). The removal efficiency of Diuron was the lowest by both the membranes: 70 % by Desal DK and 45 % by NF 200. The adsorption efficiency of the pesticides was similar for both membranes (between 30 and 40 %). In pure water, pesticide removal is a function of both the specific properties of each pesticide (solubility, molecular mass, <b>Stokes</b> <b>diameter,</b> equivalent molar diameter, calculated equivalent diameter and polarity) and the physical characteristics of the membrane (molecular weight cut-off and current load). The influence of inorganic matter on pesticide removal efficiency changed according to the type of membrane. For example, we noted an improvement in removal efficiency with the NF 200 membrane from low removal with CaCl 2 to high removal with CaSO 4 for all pesticides examined including diuron. In contrast, for the Desal DK membrane, very little change was noted (a slight decrease in the removal efficiency of DEA and simazine with CaCl 2). Adsorption by the membranes remained stable for all the pesticides tested on the two types of membrane. The improvement in the removal of pesticides by the NF 200 membrane was probably linked to pores being blocked by ions at high concentrations. It could be concluded from these results that elimination of pesticides is quantitatively linked to the physical characteristics of the membranes and that inorganic matter only has an effect with wide-pore membranes (NF 200 membrane) and, furthermore, it has no influence on the adsorption of the pesticides on the membranes. For water containing organic matter, we have noted an improvement in the removal of certain pesticides with the NF 200 membrane when compared to distilled water (except diuron). With the Desal DK membrane, we observed a slight decrease in the removal of DEA, simazine and isoproturon, and a substantial drop for diuron (20 %) with no change for cyanazine and atrazine. Adsorption of the pesticides on the membranes remained unchanged with the NF 200 membrane but increased by about 10 % on the Desal DK membrane for all molecules. Pesticides, notably triazines, adsorb easily on organic matter by physiosorption (weak links) and by chemisorption (ionic links) to form macromolecules. The steric congestion and the density of these pseudo-complexes is high, which facilitated the elimination of certain pesticides with the (wide-pore) NF 200 membrane by accentuating the effects of steric exclusion and electrostsatic repulsion and decreasing adsorption. For the Desal DK membrane, the increased adsorption of the pesticides on the membrane generated a more significant transition of these molecules {{in the direction of the}} permeate. This had a negative influence on the removal of some pesticides, depending on their size; the largest molecules underwent the least change. Diuron behaved differently from the other pesticides examined. This molecule did not bind to humic acids and its removal rate did not change with a wide-pore (NF 200) membrane. However a greater adsorption of organic matter by the narrower-pore (Desal DK) membrane favored diuron adsorption and, consequently, its diffusion into the permeate. The effect of organic matter and, more specifically, of humic acids on the elimination of pesticides depends not only on the structure of the molecules, but also on the cut-off threshold of the membrane. The two main mechanisms that govern the process of pesticide elimination by NF are repulsion (steric and electrostatic) by the membrane and adsorption on the membrane. This latter phenomenon must be minimized, to reduce the elimination of pesticides by fostering their transition in the direction of the permeate. In addition, removal of the pesticides by NF was favoured by the high-molecular weight organic matter fraction (i. e., humic acids). The influence of the inorganic matter (CaCl 2 and CaSO 4), for its part, is greater with the wide-pore membrane...|$|E
