50|$|Osteodiscus andriashevi is {{a species}} of marine fish in the family Liparidae (snailfishes or <b>seasnails).</b> This species is known from the deep waters of the Sea of Okhotsk in the {{northwest}} Pacific where in occurs at depths of from 766 to 1950 m. It grows to a length of 17.5 cm SL. This species {{is one of three}} known members of its genus.|$|R
50|$|Osteodiscus cascadiae or the bigtail {{snailfish}} is {{a marine}} {{fish in the}} family Liparidae (snailfishes or <b>seasnails).</b> This species is known from the deep waters of the Northeast Pacific (British Columbia, Canada to at least Oregon, United States) where in occurs at depths of from 1900 to 3000 m. It grows to a lengths from 7.4 cm SL (male/unsexed) to 8.5 cm SL (female). This species {{is one of three}} known members of its genus. The species name cascadiae refers to the Cascadia Abyssal Plain, a location off Oregon where the fish has been found.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Over 85 % of all ichthyoplankton {{found in}} the study area in 1976 and 1978 were young-of-year (Y-O-Y) Boreogadus. Most of the {{remainder}} were <b>seasnails</b> (Cyclopteridae). Densities of Y-O-Y cod were related to season, depth, and (to a lesser degree) year and lodation. From June to at least mid-August, Y-O-Y cod were normally most abundant at 10 - 20 m depth and rare or absent at the immediate surface. Densities decreased below- 20 m and no Y-O-Y cod were caught at depths> 250 m. After mid-August densities decreased at all depths sampled. More Y-O-Y cod may have been present {{in the study area}} in 1976 than in 1978, and Y-O-Y were significantly longer at a given date in 1976 than in 1978...|$|R
50|$|Montagu's <b>seasnail</b> (Liparis montagui) is {{a marine}} fish of the <b>seasnail</b> family (Liparidae). It inhabits the northeastern Atlantic, mainly around the British Isles, the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea, {{southern}} Iceland {{and as far}} north as the Barents Sea. It is a small (maximum 12 cm), demersal fish, usually living between from the intertidal zone to 30 metres deep, where it hides under stones or algae. It mainly feeds on small invertebrates, such as small crabs, shrimp and amphipods.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} known under the common names of {{gelatinous}} <b>seasnail</b> and gelatinous snailfish in English. It {{is also known}} as dökki sogfiskur in Icelandic, fabricius ringbug in Danish, and limace gélatineuse in French.|$|E
50|$|Rhodichthys regina, the {{threadfin}} <b>seasnail,</b> is {{a species}} of snailfish native to the Arctic Ocean and the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. It has been found at depths of from 1080 to 2365 m. This species grows to a length of 31 cm SL. This species is the only known member of its genus.|$|E
50|$|The Atlantic <b>seasnail</b> or Atlantic {{snailfish}} (Liparis antlanticus) is a fish {{belonging to}} the genus Liparis. It is a small tadpole-like fish with a soft, scaleless body and complex ventral sucker. The ventral fins have been re purposed to be a sucker. They have a single dorsal fin with about six spines differentiated from the soft rays by a slight notch. This species reaches a maximum length of about 5 inches. It ranges from Newfoundland to New Jersey. The Atlantic <b>seasnail</b> lives in the immediately subtidal region to depths of 183 m (100 fathoms.) In northern parts of its range, it is found on the shore line. It breeds in mid-winter, the eggs being laid amongst hydroid growths on the sea bed, and on stony ground. Its food is mainly small crustaceans, particularly shrimps, but occasionally small fishes are eaten.|$|E
50|$|The common <b>seasnail</b> {{feeds on}} small crustaceans, such as shrimps, crabs and amphipods, and also polychaete worms and fish. It breeds {{in the winter}} in the {{southern}} part of its range and in spring in the northern part. The eggs are laid on the seabed amongst short algae or hydroids. The eggs hatch in 6-8 weeks and the larvae are pelagic, forming part of the plankton.|$|E
50|$|Liparis fabricii, {{commonly}} known as the gelatinous <b>seasnail</b> or gelatinous snailfish, is a benthopelagic species of snailfish from the Arctic Ocean. It has a tadpole-like body with a maximum length of about 30 cm. It is brown to black in coloration with a distinctive dark peritoneum. It preys on small crustaceans and marine worms. It is not commercially important, though it is a valuable food source for predatory fish and seabirds in the Arctic region.|$|E
50|$|The common <b>seasnail</b> is {{native to}} the northeastern Atlantic Ocean as far east as the Barents Sea, Novaya Zemlya, Spitsbergen and Bear Island and {{as far south as}} the British Isles. It is also present in the Baltic Sea and North Sea, the waters around Iceland and Greenland and as far west as the Gulf of Maine. Its depth range is from 5 m to 300 m and it lives near the seabed in inshore waters.|$|E
5000|$|Liparis callyodon, or {{the spotted}} {{snailfish}} and by one source the beautiful tooth <b>seasnail,</b> is a {{fish from the}} genus Liparis. It lives in marine and demersal environments at a depth range from zero to twenty meters. It {{can be found at}} temperate climate zones, such as the eastern Pacific Ocean from Alaska, USA to Oregon, USA, in intertidal zones (tide pools). The name callyodon comes from the Greek word meaning [...] "beautiful tooth". Pallas chose this name after the species' tricuspid teeth.|$|E
50|$|The common <b>seasnail</b> is an unusual-looking {{fish with}} a large head and front {{part of the body}} and a {{laterally}} compressed posterior part of the body and large fringing fins. Its length is generally between 8 and 14 cm. The bony head has two pairs of nostrils on the snout. The pectoral fins are very large and unite beneath the body. The pelvic fins {{take the form of a}} large sucking disc located between the pectorals. The dorsal fin has 27 to 36 soft rays and both it and the anal fins overlap the caudal fin. The skin is slimy and lacks scales.|$|E
