Although {{a wide array of}} opinions is expressed on Russian policy in the newly independent states in the media and in parliament, a dominant consensus appears to have emerged among foreign policy influentials on the need for active presence and influence in the area.

Using quarterly data from 1976 to 2000, a linearized Almost Ideal Demand System was estimated for beef, pork, poultry, and fish. Simulation results indicate that the increased food health concerns for fat and cholesterol have resulted in a 6 % reduction in the consumption of beef per capita per quarter since 1987, and an 18 % increase in the poultry consumption. The results also indicate that there is a significant negative <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect</b> of beef advertising on pork consumption and vice versa.

30|$|A gradual {{transformation}} of the international system, on the other hand, {{is the type of}} integration advocated by neo-functionalists and unlike the previous one, it starts from below. Just as federalists, proponents of gradual approaches to integration would find support in Kant’s Perpetual Peace suggesting that integration “from a State of Nations [,] would be ever increasing and finally embrace all peoples of the earth” [10, p. 136]. Gradual integration can occur through the interrelated <b>spill-over</b> and socialization <b>effects.</b> The socialization effect derives its logic from social constructivism suggesting for the mutually dependent and equal relationship between the agent and the structure just described in the preceding paragraph. Socialization is intertwined with the <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect,</b> as both parallel effects have to be active in order to generate integration. The <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect</b> implies a gradual delegation of functions from the national to the supranational level taking place {{as a result of the}} functional spill-over creating integrative pressures in one policy area through integration in another, and the political spill-over shifting the level of attention from the national to the supranational level. As Ernest Haas puts it, “integration brings loyalties, expectations and political activities towards a new centre, whose institutions possess or demand jurisdiction over the pre-existing national states” [12, p. 139].|$|R

This {{was due to}} the pull of newly {{installed}} infrastructures, particularly roads, and the sporadic growth of trade in strategically situated municipalities that have better economic opportunities. The 1990 growth originated from the strong attraction of employment opportunities in established urban centers, which have become a source of growth of adjacent municipalities.

30|$|The two interdependent <b>effects</b> of <b>spill-over</b> and {{socialization}} {{were expected to}} lead to a gradual global integration taking place from below. A <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect</b> similar to that established in the European Union could not be verified within the UN. The occasional cooperation between states that takes place under the egis of the UN remains strictly within the limits of the issue concerned, whereby the level of governance is clearly that of the state, as the UN lacks any means of effective enforcement. Whether or not the <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect</b> might set in in future, however, could depend on the other variable – the socialization effect. This is because in accordance with the social constructivist predictions, the socializing forces prevalent in international organizations change the mind-sets of the bureaucrats working there. Those officials become increasingly detached from their national governments and initiate a transition of governmental functions from the national towards the supranational level. This effect was proven to have considerably contributed to the integration process in the European Union. The same effect was expected to be found among UN officials.|$|R

50|$|One of its protagonists was Ernst B. Haas, a US {{political}} scientist. Jean Monnet's {{approach to}} European integration, which aimed at integrating individual sectors {{in hopes of}} achieving <b>spill-over</b> <b>effects</b> to further the process of integration, {{is said to have}} followed the neofunctional school's tack. Unlike previous theories of integration, neofunctionalism declared to be non-normative and tried to describe and explain the process of regional integration based on empirical data. Integration was regarded as an inevitable process, rather than a desirable state of affairs that could be introduced by the political or technocratic elites of the involved states' societies. Its strength however was also its weakness: While it understood that regional integration is only feasible as an incremental process, its conception of integration as a linear process made the explanation of setbacks impossible.|$|E
30|$|The strong {{resistance}} of the nation-states prevented a constitutional federal system and “the Community began life as an international organisation founded on a Treaty [the Rome Treaty] between sovereign States” (Mancini and Keeling, 1994 : p. 176); therefore, the Community as a term referred to the community of member states but not European people (Caporaso, 2000, p. 16). Here, the main problem of the federalists was ‘sovereignty’ as the key concept legitimizing {{the existence of the}} nation state (Slanter, 1994), and they needed to develop an alternative concept to legitimize a supranational European Union. In this regard, ‘solidarity’ emerged as an alternative concept and Monnet had an influential functionalist idea for achieving a de facto solidarity among European nations through providing wealth to ‘European people’ (De Sousa and Moury, 2009). According to the new functionalist understanding, an economic community would initially be created, and then it would gradually evolve into a political community. Developing economic interdependence among the members would result in a <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect</b> and the economic community would be easily deepened. In the second phase of this functionalist process, interdependence and the <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect</b> would start to cover political issues and this would strengthen ‘solidarity’ among the European people (Niemann and Schmitter, 2009).|$|R

50|$|The {{most obvious}} benefit of {{environmental}} certification {{is that it}} is used as in instrument to allow actors to make important improvements to the way the environment is managed and in achieving sustainable development. They are usually used as an indicator of the environmental commitment of the organisation thus allowing the organisations involved to have the advantages attributed to environmental proactivity such as gaining a competitive advantage or environmental productivity. Therefore, the environmental certification generally satisfies the ethical and competitive expectations that lead the company to initiate the certification process. The general scope of the certification process can be looked at {{by the size of the}} area that is influences, either directly or through demonstration or <b>spill-over</b> <b>effects.</b> For example, the FSC since it was established in 1993 has overseen the certification of forests in sixty countries, totalling nearly 50 million ha, and equivalent to perhaps 1.5 percent of the world’s total forest area2, thus making it a large and inclusive certification process with a wide scope. The benefit of environmental certification for consumers is that they can purchase products with the knowledge of the company’s environmental standards and procedures therefore giving the general public the option to consume in an ethical way. As a result of the ethical production, consumers may be willing to pay an additional price as a way of promoting and sustaining ethical production.|$|E

Because of eroding balances of power, McCain stated that the current world order {{was in a state of}} decay. The senator accused the West of being weak vis-à-vis Russia and criticized the diplomatic approach pursued by US Secretary of State Kerry. This attitude, according to McCain, would only promote the military aggression of Russia. The Senator also expressed skepticism towards the Syria agreement, which he said rewarded aggression and was just another sign of Western weakness. McCain also stated that this agreement was insufficient to end the refugee crisis, which Russia would be using as a weapon against the Western community. The Secretary General of the -Gulf Cooperation Council, Al Zayani, supported the Syria agreement. Norbert Röttgen, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Bundestag, said that Russia had won the upper hand in the Middle East through its violent actions in Syria.

30|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the <b>spill-over</b> and socialization <b>effects</b> was demonstrated in the European Union, where initial economic cooperation led to the Union transforming into one political entity willing to deepen its integration even further. The transformation from an issue-related, technical cooperation into a deep integrated geo-political entity was made possible, among others, by the bureaucracy and its capacity to rationalize and depoliticize issues through standard operating procedures, which led to an institutional spill-over. The socialization process among EU-bureaucrats, on the other hand, created a supranational mentality, which, in turn, further influenced the integration process. Thus, for the federal world government scenario to become true through a gradual integration from below, the technical <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect</b> has {{to be accompanied by}} the socialization effect turning the minds of officials within an international organization towards a deeper integration.|$|R

They may also influence the care provided to individuals in fee-for-service plans through a <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect.</b> The objective of this study was to investigate the associations among HMO market penetration, HMO and hospital competition, and the quality of care received by Medicare fee-for-service patients measured by risk-adjusted hospital mortality rates. DATA SOURCES: The 1990 data for 1, 927 hospitals in 134 metropolitan statistical areas (with five or more hospitals) included Medicare fee-for-service risk-adjusted mortality rates from the Medicare Hospital Information Reports, hospital characteristics from the American Hospital Association annual survey, and HMO market penetration and competition calculated from InterStudy and Group Health Association of America data. STUDY DESIGN: Statistical regression techniques were used to identify the associations between HMO market penetration, competition, and risk-adjusted mortality, controlling for other hospital characteristics and region. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Higher HMO market penetration and to a lesser degree increased HMO competition were associated with better mortality outcomes for fee-for-service Medicare enrollees. Competition between hospitals did not exhibit a significant association. CONCLUSIONS: HMOs may have a <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect</b> on quality of care received by individuals enrolled in fee-for-service plans. These findings may be explained by a positive effect on local practice styles or a preferential selection by HMOs for areas with better hospital care...|$|R

It was in the half of the sixties of the 20 century, i. e. {{at the time when}} there was nobody to make the effectiveness of the Keynes's policies dubious. These analyses have become a starting point of the theory of economic disequilibrium. It has reached its full development as late as in the seventies and eighties of the 20 century, especially in France. The research programme of the theory of economic disequilibrium is carried out by searching the microeconomic basic points of the Keynes macroeconomics. This proves, that although in the real economic life an economic subject tries to reach the optimum, he/she is forced to choose a solution which is not an optimum one. The fact that some economic subjects are subject to limitations has very important macroeconomic consequences, unemployment being one of them. The theory of economic disequilibrium brings some interesting facts into the analysis of recent unemployment. They are such facts as limitations, relative rigidity of wages, <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect</b> and finally reasoning the existence of unvoluntary unemployment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the impacts of {{decoupling}} single farm payments in Scotland. It focuses on aggregate impacts on the agricultural products in domestic and external markets and the <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect</b> of this on the non-agricultural sector as well as an aggregate impact on the Scottish GDP. In order to capture system-wide impacts of the policy reform, a CGE model was formulated and implemented using a social accounting matrix constructed for Scotland. The simulation results suggest that the Scottish agricultural sector may encounter declines in output and factor us as a result of the policy reform. However, this critically depends on two factors: (a) the price effect of the policy reform on Scottish agricultural products relative to the EU average as well as the conditions of changes in world agricultural market prices; and (b) the extent to which customers would be sensitive to price effects of the policy reform. As far as the spill-over effec to the non-agricultural sector is concerned, decoupling of direct payments seems to have a positive <b>spill-over</b> <b>effect.</b> Similarly, the aggregate GDP effect is positive under all simulation scenarios. Critically, the simulation experiments indicate that policy shock may have a symmetrical outcome across the two sectors, with contractions in agriculture being accompanied by expansions in the non-agricultural sector, mainly because of factor market interactions between the two sectors...|$|R
