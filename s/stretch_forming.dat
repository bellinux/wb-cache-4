50|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the abdomen}} is substantially determined by morphoanatomic adaptation, in both sexes, {{as a function}} of the reproduction. In general, the 10 urites (one of the segments of the abdomen or post-abdomen) are reduced to a lower number of urites because of structural modifications of the first urite and the last. Typically there is atrophying of the first urite and the merging of 2 ° and 3 ° urotergites. Tergites and sternites can be well distinguished from each other, but often there is a differential development, with the tergites overlapping the sternites; the extreme case is when the expansions of tergite ventrally merge, forming a tube structure or ring. In females, the last urites become thinner and <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> a flexible telescopic ovipositor. This morphological adaptation is often accompanied by sclerotisation of the terminal eighth urite, so that the ovipositor is able to penetrate through the tissues of the organism which will accommodate the eggs and larvae. In the male, the last urites undergo a complex transformation to form a device, integrated with the genitalia called the hypopygium. The degree and nature of structural change varies according to the systematic group, but usually involves the development of the lobes of the ninth urotergite into forceps (epandrium) and IX urosterno (hypandrium). There is sometimes a twist along the axis of the abdomen, resulting in reversal of the positions of the epandrium and the hypandrium.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMulti-gripper {{flexible}} <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> {{is a novel}} {{sheet metal}} forming process aimed at improving the conformability of sheet metal to forming die, material utilization and forming quality of sheet metal. Straight jaws in traditional <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> machines are replaced {{by a pair of}} opposed clamping mechanisms movable relative to each other during the forming process. In the present study, a wave-like surface part was selected as the study object, and the forming processes of traditional <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> and multi-gripper flexible <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> were performed using a commercially available finite element analysis software to show their influences on conformability of sheet metal. In addition, three levels of transition lengths in multi-gripper flexible <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> were chosen to investigate their influence on forming results. The simulation results show that multi-gripper flexible <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> would result in an easier conformability of sheet metal than traditional <b>stretch</b> <b>forming.</b> It is also found that the sheet metal can be formed without a transition length, which could significantly improve the material utilization. In addition, the simulation results show that a shorter transition length would result in a smaller maximum strain in the forming zone, which may provide a useful guidance on choosing the transition length of sheet metal...|$|E

A {{new type}} of {{discrete}} clamp <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> machine based on flexible holding technology was developed to improve the performance of traditional rigid clamp <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> machine used for double-curvature metal sheet forming, and its forming characters were illuminated simply.

The larger the spherical radius is, the smaller the minimum transitional length of sheet metal is.

40|$|The <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> {{process is}} used to make {{structural}} sheet metal parts in the aerospace industry. The development of <b>stretch</b> <b>forming</b> tools has long been plagued by significant challenges.

These problems are related to the method of system identification and process variation.

This paper reports on a study of the lubricant's influence on the <b>stretching</b> <b>forming</b> process.
