5|$|Toby {{had been}} {{discussing}} {{the details of}} the Scranton Strangler case with Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) for some time. Having grown weary of the subject, she snaps at him that he should do something about it, or <b>stop</b> <b>talking.</b> Toby accordingly goes to the local prison to talk to the person convicted of being the notorious local murderer and tell him he believes he is innocent. Offscreen, the convict begins strangling Toby for his part in the conviction. However, Toby does have his spirits lifted after Nellie gives him a lift from the hospital and commends him for his bravery.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman is}} {{revealed}} to be a genie. Stokes is angry that he wasted his first two wishes; Stokes had previously wished for his boss to <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> (which caused Gilmore's mouth to disappear) and for a boat. The boat, however, was not placed in water and Stokes is still forced {{to pay taxes on}} it. The genie suggests that Anson should give his physically handicapped brother the ability to walk as his third wish; but he instead wishes for the ability to be turned invisible. Anson, now invisible, runs out into the street and is killed by a truck as he crosses the road.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{finds that}} he cannot <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> about his divorce {{when trying to}} meet new women at a bar. After he meets a woman {{recovering}} from her own divorce, he has to leave her {{to speak to a}} prostitute whom he sees across the room with a prosthetic hand and fingernails painted {{in the same way as}} the Ice Truck Killer's first victim. Working on a hunch that the Ice Truck Killer is an acrotomophiliac, Angel decides to speak to Debra's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper, a prosthetics specialist and (unbeknownst to anyone else) the actual Ice Truck Killer. Rudy cooperates with the interview upon realizing that Angel does not know his identity. Later, Angel is stabbed in a parking lot by a masked man. Angel manages to elbow him in the face before two men scare the attacker off. Minutes later, Rudy - who had earlier fallen out with Debra due to secretly having dinner with Dexter - arrives with flowers. They kiss, but Rudy backs away complaining of a cut lip, suggesting that he was Angel's attacker.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} said that the intense {{arrangement}} of the song owes much to their desire to be the most memorable band on the multi-act tours of the U.K. they were booked on in the early days. The repeating guitar riff and Burdon's screaming vocals did seem to ensure that of all the bands a crowd might see, the Animals were the group that people couldn't <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> about and the song the one they couldn't get out of their heads.|$|E

25|$|The {{expansion}} of St. Peter's led to federal {{approval for a}} post office at the mission in 1885. After arriving in Montana, Mother Amadeus asked Bishop Brondel to give her control over the Ursulines, but he declined to do so. Amadeus repeatedly asked Mother Stanislaus, head of the Toledo chapterhouse (and who exercised authority over the Ursulines at St. Peter's), for more sisters {{to help with the}} work in Montana. Her requests were denied. She appealed to Richard Gilmour, Bishop of Cleveland, Ohio. When Mother Stanislaus complained, Mother Amadeus denied she was making an end-run around the chapterhouse, claiming instead that she was acting under instruction from Bishop Brondel. In February 1886, Bishop Gilmour ordered the Ursulines in Toledo to <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> about how much they wished to teach in Montana, and ordered the St. Peter's Ursulines separated from the Toledo chapter.|$|E

They are interrupted by a young girl holding a distinctive box, singing a cryptic rhyme about [...] "The Gentlemen". Riley and Buffy speak after class and they almost kiss, but are unable to <b>stop</b> <b>talking.</b> They leave when it becomes awkward. Buffy calls Giles to tell him of her dream and {{the details of the}} little girl's rhyme.|$|E

[...] They briefly visited their mother in St. Louis, but {{at the age of}} eight Angelou was raped, and in retaliation the rapist was killed by members of her family. [...] She felt so guilty for his death that she chose to <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> to everyone but Bailey for several years. [...] They were sent back to Stamps, but when Bailey turned 14, they returned to their mother's care in San Francisco for his protection. [...] At first, Angelou was resistant and angry towards her mother for abandoning her and Bailey, choosing to call her [...] "Lady", and it took her several years to warm to her.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{winning the}} Grammy for Record of the Year. Take 40 Australia elaborated on the audience's {{reception at the}} July 2011 Splendour in the Grass festival, [...] "Gotye's latest song featuring Kimbra 'Somebody That I Used To Know' had become somewhat of an unofficial anthem for the festival... every car was cranking it over their speakers all day, every day... and the question on everyone's lips was whether or not Kimbra would join him on the track. Fortunately, dreams came true... he smashed out an incredible set climaxing with {{a version of the}} song with Kimbra on co-lead vocals that people couldn't <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> about all weekend long". Allmusic's Jon O'Brien felt the track was an [...] "unexpected chart-topper... is an oddball break-up song whose stuttering rhythms, reggae hooks, and hushed vocals sound like The Police as remixed by the XX".|$|E
500|$|... "Speak Now" [...] {{was written}} by Swift, as were all the tracks for the album. The song was {{inspired}} by the story of her friend and her high school boyfriend. The couple went their separate ways after high school – with the idea that they would get back together. One day, Swift's friend informed Swift that her high school boyfriend would soon wed. [...] "He had met this girl who's just this horrible, mean person who made him completely <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> to all of his friends, cut off his family. She had him so completely isolated," [...] said Swift. She asked her friend if she would [...] "speak now." [...] Perplexed, her friend asked for an explanation, and she answered, [...] "You know, storm the church. 'Speak now or forever hold your peace.' I'll go with you. I'll play guitar. It'd be great." [...] Swift's friend found this to be humorous, laughing at the idea.|$|E
500|$|The Crusaders' {{winning run}} {{finally came to}} an end when they were beaten 39–5 by the Blues in the third round of the 2003 Super 12 season. Although their 15-match unbeaten streak had ended, Richie McCaw said of the loss, [...] "...in some ways it was almost a relief. We'd finally been beaten, the run was over, so people could <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> about it and we could get on with playing it week by week." [...] The Crusaders {{recovered}} to finish second on the table with eight wins. They hosted a semi-final against the Hurricanes, who were coached by Colin Cooper, a former assistant coach for the Crusaders. Despite this inside knowledge of the team by the Wellington coach, the Crusaders won the match 39–16. In the final, the Crusaders met the Blues, another team coached by a former Crusaders assistant coach, Peter Sloane. Hooker Mark Hammett scored two tries to give the Crusaders a 10–6 lead at half-time. The Blues hit back to lead 21–10 with ten minutes to go. The Crusaders managed another converted try, but it was not enough, and the Blues won 21–17.|$|E

500|$|... "Once More, with Feeling" [...] {{propelled}} {{the story}} arc for season six by allowing characters to confess previously taboo issues {{to themselves and}} each other. Whedon commented that he was [...] "obsessive about progressing a plot in a song, about saying things we haven't said", comparing the musical theater format to the fourth-season episode [...] "Hush", in which characters begin communicating when they <b>stop</b> <b>talking.</b> According to Buffy essayist Zoe-Jane Playdon, earlier episodes' [...] "false saccharine behaviour" [...] impedes the characters so crucially that it summons a demon {{to force them to}} be honest. The consequences in the episode of concealing truth, spontaneous combustion, is an allusion to Bleak House by Charles Dickens—of whom Whedon is a fan—where characters also face immolation for being deceitful. For Buffy, however, truth is slow in coming, as she continues to lie to the Scoobies, claiming to forget what she sang about in the graveyard during [...] "Going Through the Motions". Buffy continues her charade in the chorus number [...] "If We're Together", beginning the song by persuading others to join in one by one, as if each is convinced that she is still invested and in charge, and their strength as a group is infallible. Although she asks in verse [...] "Apocalypse / We've all been there / The same old trips / Why should we care?", all the Scoobies join her, including Giles despite his suspicions that Buffy is no longer interested in her life.|$|E
500|$|In May2007, Usher {{split with}} Patton as his manager. This {{prompted}} [...] "gossip" [...] that Usher had [...] "fired" [...] {{her because of}} his growing relationship with Foster. He denied the claims, saying, [...] "I love my mother ... I decided not to fire, not get rid of, but to give [...] the ultimate complimentto retire {{her to be a}} full-time grandmother." [...] He continued by stating that the split was a mutual decision. It was speculated that Patton's dismissal was due to his engagement with Foster; Usher dismissed these claims on Total Request Live (TRL) in May2008. In what MTV News' Shawn Adler called an [...] "angry tirade", Usher stated, [...] "My wife {{had nothing to do with}} me firing my mother — nothing like that, that's trash. I hear y'all talking crazy out there. She's a beautiful black woman. Stop. <b>Stop</b> <b>talking.</b> And I love her. Stop it." [...] The outbreak was compared to Mariah Carey's unannounced 2001 appearance on TRL, when she handed out popsicles to the show's audience and performed a [...] "striptease", while some fans noted Usher's speech as evidence that Foster was being controlling of Usher. Usher hired Benny Medina as his new manager; Medina said of Usher, [...] "The thing that excited me most is the intense commitment to his art, his incredible professionalism and the fact that I feel as though he's just hitting a stride." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hush" [...] explores issues {{relating}} to the limits and benefits of language and communication. During the first act of the episode, the characters are presented as being overwhelmed by language that is misused, used as white noise, and employed {{as a means of}} avoiding truth. Many of the conversations between characters, even those that are seemingly insignificant to the episode's plot or to the show's overall history, deal in some way with various aspects or forms of communication. Whedon stated that he was unaware of how [...] "inevitably coherent" [...] this theme was until after the script was completed. Buffy and Riley are unable to act upon their attraction because they cannot stop babbling, primarily to keep their true identities concealed from each other, but also to avoid becoming closer emotionally. Xander is unable or unwilling to express what Anya means to him, and Anya, still new at interacting with humans, uses blunt, often rude language that distances herself from all the other characters. Giles desperately wants the others to <b>stop</b> <b>talking.</b> Willow considers the women in the Wicca group to be nonsensical, later complaining to Buffy [...] "Talk, all talk. Blah blah Gaia. Blah blah moon, menstrual lifeforce power thingy. You know after a couple sessions I was hoping we would get into something real, but..." [...] These pseudo conversations are what Buffy essayists Alice Jenkins and Susan Stuart refer to as [...] "locutionary acts": language that is formed to have meaning but does not engage the listener.|$|E

500|$|Cameron {{agreed to}} meet with Schwarzenegger about the film and devised a plan to avoid casting him; he would pick a fight with him and return to Hemdale and find him unfit for the role. Upon meeting him, however, Cameron was entertained by Schwarzenegger who would {{talk about how the}} villain should be played. Cameron began {{sketching}} his face on a notepad and asked Schwarzenegger to <b>stop</b> <b>talking</b> and remain still. After the meeting, Cameron returned to Daly saying Schwarzenegger would not play Reese but that [...] "he'd make a hell of a Terminator". Schwarzenegger was not as excited by the film; during an interview on the set of Conan the Destroyer, an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had (which were for The Terminator). Schwarzenegger responded, [...] "Oh some shit movie I'm doing, take a couple weeks." [...] He recounted in his memoir, Total Recall, that he was initially hesitant, but thought that playing a robot in a contemporary film would be a challenging change of pace from Conan the Barbarian and that the film was low profile enough that it would not damage his career if it were unsuccessful. He also wrote that [...] "it took [...] awhile to figure out that Jim [...] was the real deal." [...] In preparation for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons {{to be able to use}} them and feel comfortable around them. Schwarzenegger speaks only 18 lines in the film, and fewer than 100 words. James Cameron said that [...] "Somehow, even his [...] accent worked... It had a strange synthesized quality, like they hadn't gotten the voice thing quite worked out." ...|$|E
