500|$|... "So Seductive" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, with many naming it a standout track from Thoughts of a Predicate Felon. Stylus Magazine writer Ross McGowan called the song [...] "a two-headed attack {{that resulted in}} one of the summer’s best singles", and complimented how the song fits Tony Yayo's persona, writing that [...] "So Seductive" [...] is practically a blueprint for how Tony Yayo should be packaged. He isn’t a very good rapper, but he is an entertaining personality and crew-member." [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic described [...] "So Seductive" [...] as a [...] "hooky party number" [...] that Yayo [...] "handles extremely well", citing it {{as an example of how}} he [...] " [...] craftier and smarter than expected considering the thug myth built around him". Writing for The Michigan Daily, Evan McGarvey observed that the song works as a [...] "servicable first single", calling it an [...] "open-palm slap of a tune". He also complimented 50 Cent's performance, writing that he [...] "wisely takes a verse of his own and laces the track with an easy, Richard Scary hook". However, Fiona McKinlay of musicOMH denounced Tony Yayo's rapping on the song, calling his vocals [...] "really pretty disappointing". She also criticized the song's production as unoriginal, noting that [...] "there's nothing catchy, nothing memorable and it's not even any good for <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> booty to", and concluded that [...] "as anything other than musical wallpaper, [...] is about as much use as soggy toast", although she conceded that it was [...] "probably going to be a Top Ten smash". At the 2005 Vibe Awards, [...] "So Seductive" [...] was nominated for best [...] "Club Banger", but lost to [...] "1 Thing" [...] by singer Ameriie.|$|E
2500|$|Cosby {{was asked}} {{directly}} about Buress's comments {{and the resulting}} fallout in two November 2014 interviews, which were originally intended to be about a new art exhibit at the Smithsonian that featured his private collection of African American art. In an NPR interview on November 15, 2014, reporter Scott Simon said: [...] "This question gives me no pleasure, Mr. Cosby, {{but there have been}} serious allegations raised about you in recent days." [...] Cosby became silent, leading to an awkward radio exchange in which Simon verbally described Cosby's actions to listeners: [...] "you're <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> head no." [...] Simon continued asking Cosby to comment on the allegations before finally wrapping up the interview with no further communication from Cosby. In a November 6, 2014, interview with Associated Press reporter Brett Zongker, Cosby appeared visibly rattled by unexpected Buress questions and told Zongker, [...] "No, no, we don't answer that." [...] In the proceeding minutes, Cosby repeatedly attempted to get Zongker to confirm that the AP would edit out the Buress questions, implying that Zongker's [...] "integrity" [...] and ability to be a [...] "serious reporter" [...] would be compromised if that portion of the interview was not [...] "scuttled". When Zongker failed to guarantee this request, Cosby turned to his off-camera publicist David Brokaw and told him to get on the phone with Zongker's editors [...] "immediately". When the interview was first released on November 10, the Buress questions had indeed been omitted. However, after the allegations continued to gain new traction, including a new accusation from Janice Dickinson, the AP decided to release footage of the full exchange on November 19.|$|E

In <b>Shake</b> <b>Your</b> Booty, teams had to learn a traditional local dance, and perform it with Winiama masked dancers for a crowd of locals. When they successfully performed the moves, they received their next clue. But if three local celebrity judges felt a team lacked creativity or had a bad performance, the team would incur a 10-minute penalty.|$|R

60|$|After that, Felix {{lay awake}} for some hours, hearing the {{rain on the}} roof, and puzzled in his own head by a half-uncertain memory. What was it in his school reading that that {{ceremony}} with the water indefinitely reminded him of? Wasn't there some Greek or Roman superstition about <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> head when water was poured upon it? What could that superstition be, and what light might it cast on that mysterious ceremony?

What's the use of <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> head when all their dresses are ordered? Thirty tunics, thirty wreaths, thirty pairs of sandals and silk stockings, thirty crooks, you scoundrel--and you have the impudence to offer me only twenty-three hands to hold them. Not a word! I won't hear a word! Get me my thirty girls, or lose your place." [...] The marquis roared out this last terrible {{sentence}} {{at the top of his}} voice, and pointed peremptorily to the door.|$|E

You remember how you always said we were but an encampment of Bedouins, and that you would awake some morning to find us fled for ever. Nothing unsettled me more than these ill-judged remarks. I was doing my best to be a sedentary semi-respectable man in a suburban villa; and you were always <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> head at me and assuring me (what I knew to be partly true) that it was all a farce. Even here, when I have sunk practically all that I possess, and have good health and my fill of congenial fighting, and could not possibly get away if I wanted ever so--even here and now the recollection of these infidel prophesies rings in my ears like an invitation to the sea.

6000|$|Before {{you take}} your cane at the door, look for one instant at the statue-room. Yonder is Jouffley's [...] "Jeune Fille {{confiant}} son premier secret à Vénus." [...] Charming, charming! It is from the exhibition of this year only; and I think the best sculpture in the gallery--pretty, fanciful, naïve; admirable in workmanship and imitation of Nature. I have seldom seen flesh better represented in marble. Examine, also, Jaley's [...] "Pudeur," [...] Jacquot's [...] "Nymph," [...] and Rude's [...] "Boy with the Tortoise." [...] These are not very exalted subjects, or what are called exalted, and do not go beyond simple, smiling beauty and nature. But what then? Are we gods, Miltons, Michel Angelos, that can leave earth when we please; and soar to heights immeasurable? No, my dear MacGilp; but the fools of academicians would fain make us so. Are you not, and half the painters in London, panting {{for an opportunity to}} show your genius in a great [...] "historical picture?" [...] O blind race! Have you wings? Not a feather: and yet you must be ever puffing, sweating up to the tops of rugged hills; and, arrived there, clapping and <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> ragged elbows, and making as if you would fly! Come down, silly Daedalus; come down to the lowly places in which Nature ordered you to walk. The sweet flowers are springing there; the fat muttons are waiting there; the pleasant sun shines there; be content and humble, and take your share of the good cheer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whatever it is," [...] rejoined Allan, [...] "we'll {{treat it}} like a dose of physic--we'll take it at once, {{and be done with}} it." [...] He went on reading: [...] "'And no license to marry without banns shall be granted, unless oath shall be first made by one of the parties that he or she {{believes}} that there is no impediment of kindred or alliance'--well, I can take my oath of that with a safe conscience! What next? 'And one of the said parties must, for the space of fifteen days immediately preceding such license, have had his or her usual place of abode within the parish or chapelry within which such marriage is to be solemnized!' Chapelry! I'd live fifteen days in a dog-kennel with the greatest pleasure. I say, Neelie, all this seems like plain sailing enough. What are you <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> head about? Go on, and I shall see? Oh, all right; I'll go on. Here we are: 'And where one of the said parties, not being a widower or widow, shall be under the age of twenty-one years, oath must first be made that the consent of the person or persons whose consent is required has been obtained, or that there is no person having authority to give such consent. The consent required by this act is that of the father--'" [...] At those last formidable words Allan came to a full stop. [...] "The consent of the father," [...] he repeated, with all needful seriousness of look and manner. [...] "I couldn't exactly swear to that, could I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I object,' {{continued}} Thomas, quietly possessing {{himself of}} his friend's hat, which {{stood on a}} table near him,--'I object, first, to the personal appearance of the horse. I protest against the conventional idea of beauty, as attached to that animal. I think his nose too long, his forehead too low, and his legs (except {{in the case of}} the cart-horse) ridiculously thin by comparison with the size of his body. Again, considering how big an animal he is, I object to the contemptible delicacy of his constitution. Is he not the sickliest creature in creation? Does any child catch cold as easily as a horse? Does he not sprain his fetlock, for all his appearance of superior strength, as easily as I sprained my ankle! Furthermore, to take him from another point of view, what a helpless wretch he is! No fine lady requires more constant waiting-on than a horse. Other animals can make their own toilette: he must have a groom. You will tell me that this is because we want to make his coat artificially glossy. Glossy! Come home with me, and see my cat,--my clever cat, who can groom herself! Look at your own dog! see how the intelligent creature curry-combs himself with his own honest teeth! Then, again, what a fool the horse is, what a poor, nervous fool! He will start at a piece of white paper in the road as if it was a lion. His one idea, when he hears a noise that he is not accustomed to, is to run away from it. What do you say to those two common instances of the sense and courage of this absurdly overpraised animal? I might multiply them to two hundred, if I chose to exert my mind and waste my breath, which I never do. I prefer coming at once to my last charge against the horse, which is the most serious of all, because it affects his moral character. I accuse him boldly, in his capacity of servant to man, of slyness and treachery. I brand him publicly, no matter how mild he may look about the eyes, or how sleek he may be about the coat, as a systematic betrayer, whenever he can get the chance, of the confidence reposed in him. What do you mean by laughing and <b>shaking</b> <b>your</b> head at me?' ...|$|E
