40|$|Blood cell {{development}} in the Drosophila <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> is controlled by multiple factors, most of them conserved from flies to mammals. The Drosophila homolog of vertebrate PDCD 2, Zfrp 8, is required in Drosophila hematopoietic stem cell development. Zfrp 8 mutant larvae show a disruption of homeostasis in the <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> and vast <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> overgrowth. The loss of one copy of Zfrp 8 also causes a <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> enlargement. This dominant phenotype can be modified by heterozygous mutations in cell-cycle genes and several genes functioning in blood development. To identify additional genes that function in hematopoiesis, we screened a collection of second and third chromosome deficiencies for modifiers of Zfrp 8 heterozygous phenotype.

40|$|AbstractMaintenance of hematopoietic {{progenitors}} ensures {{a continuous}} supply of blood cells during the lifespan of an organism. Thus, understanding the molecular basis for progenitor maintenance is a continued focus of investigation. A large pool of undifferentiated blood progenitors are maintained in the Drosophila hematopoietic organ, the larval <b>lymph</b> <b>gland,</b> by a complex network of signaling pathways that are mediated by niche-, progenitor-, or differentiated hemocyte-derived signals. In {{this study we}} examined {{the function of the}} Drosophila fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), Heartless, a critical regulator of early <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> progenitor specification in the late embryo, during larval <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> hematopoiesis. Activation of Heartless signaling in hemocyte progenitors by its two ligands, Pyramus and Thisbe, is both required and sufficient to induce progenitor differentiation and formation of the plasmatocyte-rich <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> cortical zone. We identify two transcriptional regulators that function downstream of Heartless signaling in <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> progenitors, the ETS protein, Pointed, and the Friend-of-GATA (FOG) protein, U-shaped, which are required for this Heartless-induced differentiation response. Furthermore, cross-talk of Heartless and target of rapamycin signaling in hemocyte progenitors is required for lamellocyte differentiation downstream of Thisbe-mediated Heartless activation. Finally, we identify the Drosophila heparan sulfate proteoglycan, Trol, as a critical negative regulator of Heartless ligand signaling in the <b>lymph</b> <b>gland,</b> demonstrating that sequestration of differentiation signals by the extracellular matrix is a unique mechanism employed in blood progenitor maintenance that is of potential relevance to many other stem cell niches...|$|R

The PSC contributes to <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> homeostasis by regulating blood cell differentiation, rather than by maintaining core progenitors.

40|$|Dorsal vessel {{morphogenesis}} in Drosophila melanogaster {{serves as}} a superb system with which to study the cellular and genetic bases of heart tube formation. We used a cardioblast-expressed Toll-GFP transgene to screen for additional genes involved in heart development and identified tailup as a locus essential for normal dorsal vessel formation. tailup, related to vertebrate islet 1, encodes a LIM homeodomain transcription factor expressed in all cardioblasts and pericardial cells of the heart tube {{as well as in}} associated <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> hematopoietic organs and alary muscles that attach the dorsal vessel to the epidermis. A transcriptional enhancer regulating expression in these four cell types was identified and used as a tailup-GFP transgene with additional markers to characterize dorsal vessel defects resulting from gene mutations. Two reproducible phenotypes were observed in mutant embryos: hypoplastic heart tubes with misaligned cardioblasts and the absence of most <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> and pericardial cells. Conversely, a significant expansion of the <b>lymph</b> <b>glands</b> and abnormal morphology of the heart were observed when tailup was overexpressed in the mesoderm. Tailup was shown to bind to two DNA recognition sequences in the dorsal vessel enhancer of the Hand basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor gene, with one site proven to be essential for the <b>lymph</b> <b>gland,</b> pericardial cell, and Svp/Doc cardioblast expression of Hand.

40|$|Several {{signaling}} pathways control {{blood cell}} (hemocyte) {{development in the}} Drosophila <b>lymph</b> <b>gland.</b> Mechanisms that modulate and integrate these signals are poorly understood. Here we report that mutation in a conserved endocytic protein Asrij affects signal transmission and causes aberrant <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> hematopoiesis. Mammalian Asrij (Ociad 1) is expressed in stem cells of the blood vascular system and is implicated in several cancers. We found that Drosophila Asrij is a panhemocyte marker and localizes to a subset of endocytic vesicles. Loss of asrij causes hyperproliferation of <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> lobes coupled with increased hemocyte differentiation, thereby depleting the pool of quiescent hemocyte precursors. This corelates with fewer Col+ cells in the hematopoietic stem cell niche of asrij mutants. Asrij null mutants also show excess specification of crystal cells that express the RUNX factor Lozenge (Lz), a target of Notch signaling. Asrij mutant <b>lymph</b> <b>glands</b> show increased N in sorting endosomes suggesting aberrant trafficking. In vitro assays also show impaired traffic of fluorescent probes in asrij null hemocytes. Taken together our data suggest a role for Asrij in causing increased Notch signaling thereby affecting hemocyte differentiation. Thus, conserved endocytic functions may control blood cell progenito...|$|R
40|$|In mammals, many cytokines {{and growth}} factors stimulate {{members of the}} Janus kinase (JAK) family to transduce signals for the {{proliferation}} and differentiation of various cell types, particularly in hematopoietic lineages. Mutations in the Drosophila hopscotch (hop) gene, which encodes a JAK, also cause proliferative defects. Loss-of-function alleles result in lethality and underproliferation of diploid tissues of the larva. A dominant gain-of-function allele, Tumorous-lethal (hopTum-l), leads to formation of melanotic tumors and hypertrophy of the larval <b>lymph</b> <b>glands,</b> the hematopoietic organs. We show that a single amino acid change in Hop {{is associated with the}} hopTum-l mutation. Overexpression of either wild-type hop or hopTum-l in the larval <b>lymph</b> <b>glands</b> causes melanotic tumors and <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> hypertrophy indistinguishable from the original hopTum-l mutation. In addition, overexpression of Hop in other tissues of the larva leads to pattern defects in the adult or to lethality. Finally, overexpression of either hop or hopTum-l in Drosophila cell culture results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Hop protein. However, overexpression of hopTum-l results in greater phosphorylation than overexpression of the wild-type. We conclude that hopTum-l encodes a hyperactive Hop kinase and that overactivity of Hop in <b>lymph</b> <b>glands</b> causes malignant neoplasia of Drosophila blood cells...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe heparin sulfate {{proteoglycan}} Terribly Reduced Optic Lobes (Trol) is the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the vertebrate protein Perlecan. Trol {{is expressed}} {{as part of}} the extracellular matrix (ECM) found in the hematopoietic organ, called the <b>lymph</b> <b>gland.</b> In the normal <b>lymph</b> <b>gland,</b> the ECM forms thin basement membranes around individual or small groups of blood progenitors. The pattern of basement membranes, reported by Trol expression, is spatio-temporally correlated to hematopoiesis. The central, medullary zone which contain undifferentiated hematopoietic progenitors has many, closely spaced membranes. Fewer basement membranes are present in the outer, cortical zone, where differentiation of blood cells takes place. Loss of trol causes a dramatic change of the ECM into a three-dimensional, spongy mass that fills wide spaces scattered throughout the <b>lymph</b> <b>gland.</b> At the same time proliferation is reduced, leading to a significantly smaller <b>lymph</b> <b>gland.</b> Interestingly, differentiation of blood progenitors in trol mutants is precocious, resulting in the break-down of the usual zonation of the <b>lymph</b> <b>gland.</b> which normally consists of an immature center (medullary zone) where cells remain undifferentiated, and an outer cortical zone, where differentiation sets in. We present evidence that the effect of Trol on blood cell differentiation is mediated by Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, which is known to be required to maintain an immature medullary zone. Overexpression of hh in the background of a trol mutation is able to rescue the premature differentiation phenotype. Our data provide novel insight into the role of the ECM component Perlecan during Drosophila hematopoiesis...|$|R
40|$|SummaryCellular microenvironments {{established}} by the spatial and temporal expression of specific signaling molecules are critical for both the maintenance and lineage-specific differentiation of progenitor cells. In Drosophila, a population of hematopoietic progenitors, or prohemocytes, within the larval <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> [1] gives rise to three mature cell types: plasmatocytes, lamellocytes, and crystal cells. Removal of the secreted signaling molecules Hedgehog [2] and PVF 1 [3] from the posterior signaling center (PSC) [2, 4, 5], which acts as a niche, leads {{to a loss of}} progenitors and complete differentiation of the <b>lymph</b> <b>gland.</b> Here, we characterize a novel population of signaling cells within the <b>lymph</b> <b>gland,</b> distinct from the PSC, that are required for lineage-specific differentiation of crystal cells. We provide evidence that Yorkie [6] and Scalloped [7], the Drosophila homologs of YAP and TEAD, are required in lineage-specifying cells to regulate expression of Serrate, the Notch ligand responsible for the initiation of the crystal cell differentiation program [5,  8]. Genetic manipulation of yorkie and scalloped in the <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> specifically alters Serrate expression and crystal cell differentiation. Furthermore, Serrate expression in lineage-specifying cells is eliminated in the <b>lymph</b> <b>gland</b> upon the immune response induced by wasp parasitization to ensure the proper differentiation of lamellocytes at the expense of crystal cells. These findings expand the roles for Yorkie/Scalloped beyond growth to encompass specific cell-fate determination in the context of blood development. Similar regulatory functions may extend to their homologs in vertebrate progenitor cell niches that are required for specifying cell fate...|$|R
