5|$|The same day, several non-Serb {{civilians were}} killed in Dalj. In a {{subsequent}} round of negotiations with Croatian authorities, the SAO SBWS representatives reported 56 or 57 Croats were killed in Dalj on 1 August. Twenty-five bodies of the victims, including two civilians, were transferred to ZNG-held Osijek. Post-mortem examinations indicated <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> were beaten and then executed.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, {{the bulk}} of the {{civilian}} population and the remaining Croatian police and troops fled over snow-covered terrain in poor weather to Karlovac, Ogulin, and to the nearby territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Approximately 30–60 civilians, largely elderly people, remained in Saborsko. The JNA and SAO Krajina troops forced those who remained behind to leave the village, killing or abusing the civilians. At least 25 civilians were murdered by the troops {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the capture of Saborsko. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> were shot, while others were beaten or burned to death.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{involved the}} accidental triggering {{of a fire}} extinguishing system which sealed two forward compartments and released Halon 2402 (freon R-114B2), dibromotetrafluoroethane gas into them. According to survivors, those affected by the gas release were caught off guard and {{may not have been}} alerted in time due to warning sirens sounding only after the gas had already begun pouring in. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> were reported to have been unable to turn on breathing kits before they suffocated.|$|E

5|$|The Voćin {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 43 civilians in Voćin, Croatia, by the Serbian White Eagles paramilitary unit on 13 December 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The massacre was carried out after the unit was ordered to abandon the village before the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) recaptured the area in Operation Papuk-91. All the victims were local Croats, save one Serb, {{who had tried to}} protect his neighbours. Gunfire was the leading cause of death, though <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> were killed with axes or chainsaws, or were burned to death. The victims exhibited signs of torture and were left unburied. On the night of 13–14 December, the White Eagles dynamited a 550-year-old church in the village.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} those killed at Krečane were left unburied for two weeks. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> were not {{immediately}} killed, rather they took days to die and people living on the opposite bank of the Una River in Bosnia and Herzegovina claim that they heard cries for help for days after the killings took place. After two weeks, most of the bodies were bulldozed into a shallow grave {{on the bank of}} the river, and the rest thrown into the Una. The grave was located sufficiently close to the river to allow the current to wash at least some of the bodies away.|$|E
5|$|The worst mining {{disaster}} in the town occurred at Yew Tree Colliery on 11 December 1858 when an explosion of firedamp caused by a safety lamp cost 25 lives, the youngest victim was 11, and the oldest, 35 years of age. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> are buried in the churchyard at St George's Church. Another explosion on 6 March 1877 at Great Boys Colliery cost eight lives and on 2 October 1883, six men died when the cage rope broke at Nelson Colliery in Shakerley. On 1 October 1895 five men including the colliery manager and undermanager died at Shakerley Colliery after an explosion of firedamp.|$|E

5|$|In {{a second}} incident, the Army {{considered}} court-martialling several {{officers of the}} 157th Infantry Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Felix L. Sparks after servicemen were accused of massacring German soldiers who were surrendering at the Dachau concentration camp in 1945. Some of the German troops were camp guards; the others were sick and wounded troops from a nearby hospital. The soldiers of the 45th Division who liberated the camp were outraged at the malnourishment and maltreatment of the 32,000 prisoners they liberated, some barely alive, and all victims of the Holocaust. After entering the camp, the soldiers found boxcars filled with dead bodies of prisoners who had succumbed to starvation or last-minute executions, and in rooms adjacent to gas chambers they found naked bodies piled from the floor to the ceiling. The cremation ovens, which were still in operation when the soldiers arrived, contained bodies and skeletons as well. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> apparently had died only hours before the 45th Division entered the camp, while many others lay where they had died in states of decomposition that overwhelmed the soldiers' senses. Accounts conflict over what happened and over how many German troops were killed. After investigating the incident, the Army considered court-martialling several officers involved, but Patton successfully intervened. Seventh Army was being disbanded and Patton had been appointed Military Governor of Bavaria, placing the matter in his hands. Some veterans of the 45th Infantry Division have said that only 30 to 50 German soldiers were killed and that very few were killed trying to surrender, while others have admitted to killing or refusing to treat wounded German guards.|$|E
25|$|The next {{execution}} {{was conducted}} on 14 December 1939 when 46 people were shot dead. At least <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> came from Pruszków. Among them were Stanisław Kalbarczyk, a Polish teacher from Pruszków, and two unidentified women.|$|E
25|$|Parents of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> filed several {{unsuccessful}} {{lawsuits against}} video game manufacturers. Harris and Klebold were {{fans of the}} movie Natural Born Killers, and used the film's acronym, NBK, as a code in their home videos and journals.|$|E

25|$|Initially it was {{reported}} that six Israeli Jews were being held hostage.

25|$|In 2013, Thomas took a {{stand against}} {{cyberbullying}} after her son Tron was a victim.

40|$|In CA 1093 / 07 Bachar v.

Overall, six Supreme Court Justices have reviewed and affirmed this simple formula. However, this formula is incorrect, as it contradicts <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most basic tort premises, ignores the way impairment is calculated, and necessarily leads to <b>the</b> under-compensation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> and to an unjust enrichment <b>of</b> either <b>the</b> tortfeasor, the National Insurance Institute, or both.
