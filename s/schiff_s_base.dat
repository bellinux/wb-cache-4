N-(4 -N,N-dimethylaminobenzal) -p-anisidine (SBj), N-(4 -N,N-dimethylaminobenzal) -p-toluidine (SB 2) and N-(4 -N,N-dimethylaminobenzal) - 2, 4 -dinitroaniline (SB 3). The efficiencies have been compared with those of parent amines from which <b>Schiff</b> <b>s</b> <b>bases</b> have been derived. Results of inhibition efficiencies observed from these two methods are in good agreement and {{have been found to be}} dependent on the concentrations of inhibitors as well as those of acids. Inhibition efficiency of all inhibitors increases with increasing concentration of inhibitors. Efficiency also increases with increasing concentration of acids. Inhibition efficiency is more in case of HCl rather than in H 2 S 0 (4). Inhibition efficiency was found maximum up to 95. 55 % for mild steel in HCl solution. Inhibition efficiencies of synthesised <b>Schiff</b> <b>s</b> <b>bases</b> have been found much more than their parent amines.

The surface morphology of the carbon steel specimens in the presence and absence of the inhibitor was evaluated by AFM analysis. The corrosion inhibition efficiencies of parent amine and parent ketone on carbon steel in 1 M HCl solution have also been investigated using weight loss studies. The adsorption of A 9 Y 3 PPA obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Thermodynamic parameters (Kads, ∆G 0 ads) were calculated using the adsorption isotherm. Activation parameters of the corrosion process (Ea, ∆H* and ∆S*) were also calculated from the corrosion rates obtained from temperature studies. Tafel plot analysis revealed that A 9 Y 3 PPA acts as a mixed type inhibitor. A probable inhibition mechanism was also proposed...|$|R

40|$|The recent upsurge of {{interest}} in the peptide-based drug molecules has been accompanied by {{a great deal of attention}} to the design of stereochemically defined non-proteinogenic amino acids. As a continuous effort to develop efficient syntheses of χ-constrained amino acids in our group, we recently have developed a practical methodology for the asymmetric synthesis of substituted pyroglutamic acid, glutamic acid and proline analogues, which are of important use in examining the relationships between conformation and bioactivities of biologically important peptides (e. g. DPDPE, α-MSH). The key step in this method is an asymmetric Michael addition reaction between a chiral Ni(II) -complex of the glycine <b>Schiff</b> <b>base</b> (<b>S)</b> -NiGlyBPB, and derivatives of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids. This new method is the first highly diastereoselective, room temperature, organic base-catalyzed, asymmetric Michael addition reaction. Excellent chemical yields and diastereoselectivity, along with the simplicity of experimental procedure, renders the present method of immediate use for preparation of various novel beta-substituted pyroglutamic acids, glutamic acids and prolines. Decomposing the resulting addition products in acidic medium, followed by neutralizing with ammonia, gave optically pure substituted pyroglutamic; acids in good yields (> 80 %). The substituted pyroglutamic acids were converted to the corresponding substituted glutamic acids by hydrolysis in 6 N HCl, or to substituted proline analogues by selective reduction of amide carbonyl group to a methylene group. Both novel substituted glutamic acids and prolines are being incorporated into biologically important peptide MT-II analogues for structure-activity studies...|$|R

40|$|The Massey—Mohr (MM), <b>Schiff</b> (<b>S),</b> and Landau—Lifshitz (LL) approximations for {{the total}} elastic cross section (Q) are intercompared. All can be shown to follow from the same assumption, (i. e., the {{classical}} small‐angle deflection function, thence the Jeffreys—Born phases via the semiclassical equivalence relationship), sufficing to determine the velocity dependence of Q. Thus, for V=±C(s) /rs, Q(s) =p(s) [C(s) /hv] 2 /(s— 1) The coefficient p(s) {{is the same for}} the S and LL approximations; the ratio pSLL(s) /pMM(s) ≥ 1, (< 1. 075); it is 1. 0709 and 1. 0458 for s= 6 and 12, respectively. A numerical calculation for a repulsive (s= 12) interaction shows that the SLL formula reproduces the partial‐wave calculated Q to within ☒%. A graphical presentation suggests the generality of this result; it also indicates the source of bias in the MM approximation. For a ``realistic'' intermolecular potential, (restricting consideration to collisions in the ``thermal'' energy range), the influence of the repulsion is only to produce undulations in Q(v); the correct value of C(6) may be obtained by velocity averaging the ``apparent'' CSLL(6) ...|$|R
