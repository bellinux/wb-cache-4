500|$|On 24 June 2017 reggae group Toots and the Maytals were slotted for 17:30, with BBC Four {{scheduled}} to show highlights from their set. When {{they did not}} show it was suspected they missed their time slot, and BBC broadcaster Mark Radcliffe apologized on their behalf stating, [...] "If you were expecting Toots and the Maytals – and, frankly, we all were – it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were on Jamaican time or something because they didn't {{make it to the}} site on time." [...] The group credited with coining the term [...] "reggae" [...] in song was subsequently rescheduled by the Glastonbury Festival organizers giving Toots and the Maytals the midnight slot, with all other acts being shifted by one hour.|$|E
500|$|Staci Krause of IGN {{had mixed}} {{perspectives}} on the episode's story arcs, comparing the advanced development in the personal story lines {{to the introduction of}} disappointing medical cases. She described the story line involving Yang and Burke's silent relationship as [...] "finally showing resolution, taking pleasure to the next level", adding: [...] "It was shocking to see Cristina be the one to break, but even more shocking was Burke's two-word response: marry me. I'm really not sure why Cristina didn't just say yes, since two minutes before had said she was in it for the long haul. It <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are dragging this out for the sake of dragging it out." [...] Bailey's evolution in the episode, mainly her interactions with four competing attending physicians, were described as [...] "a reminder of why they called her the Nazi, something that was easy to forget with recent events." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, while filmmaker Julie Anne Robinson directed it. Featured music includes Psapp's [...] "King of You", The Whitest Boy Alive's [...] "Fireworks", Iain Archer's [...] "Canal Song", Miho Hatori's [...] "Barracuda" [...] and Sybarite's [...] "Runaway". Rater described that she got the idea after being told {{that her husband had}} to undergo a craniotomy. She noted that the plan for the episode was to focus on Ellis' inner feelings, mainly her fright, frustration and stress. [...] "The concept of someone with this disease having a lucid day is real. The disease varies for everyone, but experts we talked to said that patients have bad days and good days and then sometimes they have great days where it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are their old selves. Maybe it's a moment, maybe an hour, for some a whole afternoon, but we were fascinated with the idea of getting this time, this gift, and knowing that it's only temporary. What would you do with that one day? And what would it mean for Meredith?", stated Rater, explaining the premise of the episode. She also stated that [...] "the cool idea" [...] to have Meredith and Ellis connect again had been considered for almost a year before the actual concept of the episode was written, after numerous attempts to include the storyline in other episodes that [...] "didn't feel quite right": [...] "If you're going to give Meredith her mother back and then take her away again, you'd better have a pretty good reason." [...] Rater also explained that, in her vision, the episode introduces a new period in the interns' lives, focusing on their finding an identity as surgeons, becoming more central than {{in the beginning of the}} season, which revolved around the aftermath of Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)'s death and Meredith's involvement in the love triangle between her, Shepherd and Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell).|$|E

2500|$|Babies can {{recognize}} their mother's voice from {{as early as}} few weeks old. It <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> have a unique system {{that is designed to}} recognize speech sound. Furthermore, they can differentiate between certain speech sounds. [...] A significant first milestone in phonetic development is the babbling stage (around the age of six months). This is the baby's way of practicing his control over that apparatus. Babbling is independent from the language. [...] Deaf children for instance, babble the same way as hearing ones.|$|E

"First off we couldn't {{talk with}} the old woman at all; but at dinner-time a kid about half as big as me, what calls her 'grandmarm,' come home, an' {{he knew how to}} talk United States. Little as he was, he could chin in the old woman's lingo as fast as she. That fixed things for us. Joe said he was out lookin' for work, which is the dead truth when you come to that, an' made a trade for us to stay there a couple of days. I was 'fraid they'd ask about the princess, but it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> didn't. They thought she belonged to us {{straight}} enough, so it's been all plain sailin'." ...|$|E

"The villains in Will Penny are so {{unbelievable}} and so unrealistic that <b>they</b> almost <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> {{came out of}} a Western spoof, rather than the serious, realistic Western which Will Penny aspires to be (and achieves in most other aspects of the story)."

6000|$|The {{storekeeper}} told me {{that the}} two trampers had arrived there a few days before without money and without food. [...] "I gave 'em some flour and sent 'em on," [...] he said. [...] "The Siwashes will take care of them, but it ain't right. What the cussed idiots mean by setting out on such a journey I can't understand. Why, one tramp came in here early in the spring who couldn't speak English, and who left Quesnelle without even a blanket or an axe. Fact! And yet the Lord seems to take care of these fools. You wouldn't believe it, but that fellow picked up an axe and a blanket the first day out. But he'd a died only for the Indians. They won't let even a white man starve to death. I helped him out with some flour and he went on. They all rush on. <b>Seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> was just crazy to get to Dawson--couldn't sleep without dreamin' of it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Another tactic is for traffickers {{to kidnap}} their victims, and then drug them or secure {{them so they}} cannot escape.

50|$|Therefore, {{economic}} capital and cultural capital {{have the ability}} to influence the type of academic capital that one accrues both within schools and at home.

It should be fun!' And they didn't know each other before they got to my house and so I had to pick people that <b>seemed</b> to be <b>like</b> <b>they</b> could be couples, <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> could be best friends and that I just knew were up to the task of jumping into it." ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{they don't}} have much appearance, it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> hate cosmetics. They even call them disgusting.
