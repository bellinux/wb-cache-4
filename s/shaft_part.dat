5000|$|According to the Second Book of Samuel, the Jebusites {{still had}} control of Jerusalem {{at the time}} of King David, but David wished {{to take control of the}} city. Understandably the Jebusites contested his attempt to do this, and since Jebus was the strongest {{fortress}} in Canaan they gloated that even the blind and lame could withstand David's siege. According to the version of the story in the Masoretic Text, David managed to conquer the city by a surprise attack, led by Joab, through the water supply tunnels (Jerusalem has no natural water supply except for the Gihon Spring). Ever since its discovery in the 19th century, Warren's <b>Shaft,</b> <b>part</b> of a system which connects the spring to the city, has been cited as evidence for the plausibility of such a line of attack; however, the discovery, at the turn of the 21st century, of a set of heavy fortifications, including towers, around the base of the Warren's Shaft system and the spring, has made archaeologists now regard this line of attack as implausible, as it would be an attack against one of the most heavily fortified parts, and hardly a surprise. The account in 1 Chronicles mentions the advantage of a speedy attack but does not mention use of the water shafts [...] and according to many textual scholars the claim in the Masoretic Text could simply be a scribal error; the Septuagint version of the passage states that the Israelites had to attack the Jebusites with their daggers rather than through the water shaft.|$|E
30|$|An {{objective}} of this step is rough positioning of a ring part to a <b>shaft</b> <b>part.</b> Firstly, the robotic manipulator picks up a ring part from a feeder. Then, the robotic manipulator approaches the <b>shaft</b> <b>part</b> and releases the ring part on the <b>shaft</b> <b>part.</b> In this case of precise assembly of a ring part, the assembly cannot succeed because a clearance between a ring part and a <b>shaft</b> <b>part</b> disappears by deformation of the ring part. Therefore, the ring part is released once. On the other hand, if the positional difference between the ring part and the <b>shaft</b> <b>part</b> is large, the ring part falls from a <b>shaft</b> <b>part.</b> Therefore, {{it is assumed that}} the robotic manipulator is controlled with possible accuracy.|$|E

First, the engine and the transmission output shaft torque of a multi-axle vehicle powertrain system were measured by proving grounds (PG) testing and analyzed with a conclusion that the powertrain loading changes were mainly related to three key factors: the mean engine torque, the harmonic engine torque, and the vibration properties of the system. Subsequently, a dynamic model considering the three factors was built and validated by the test data. Finally, fatigue damage of <b>shaft</b> <b>parts</b> and gear parts were calculated to investigate the influence degrees of the three factors. The results show that, the harmonic engine torque and the vibration properties of the powertrain system have a great influence on the fatigue damage of <b>shaft</b> <b>parts,</b> and the mean engine torque is the main factor causing the fatigue damage of gear parts...|$|R

30|$|So far, {{the precise}} ring {{assembly}} task has been hanndled by a method using a jig {{which is one}} of passive methods. The assembly processes are described in Fig. 1. In this conventional method, the precise ring assembly becomes easy by guiding a ring part along an incline of a jig (Fig. 1 b). However, the method requires two processes of attaching a jig to a <b>shaft</b> <b>part</b> and detaching a jig from a <b>shaft</b> <b>part</b> as shown in Fig. 1 a, c. Because the two processes make cycle time long, the processes should be omitted. Originally, the function of the jig is to adjust the position and orientation of the ring by guiding along with the incline when the robotic hand pushes the ring straight down. In order to realize this guiding effect without using any jigs, we figured out a approach using a hollowed finger with an incline. Our proposed hollowed finger also solves the problem of ring deformation due to hand grasping.|$|E
