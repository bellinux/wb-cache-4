40|$|The saving {{rate and}} amount of {{consumer}} savings has taken on heightened importance in both the cyclical and secular settings. Does the current low consumer saving rate imply that spending must grow less than income in coming months, therefore slowing economic growth? Does the large and soon-to-reach-retirementage Post WW II baby boom population have enough savings to continue to <b>support</b> <b>consumption</b> and economic growth over the next decade? To answer these questions, we first look at how well the standard NIPA saving rate measures savings, and we find it inadequate.

40|$|This thesis investigates British holidaymakers' motivations, {{behaviours}} {{and experiences}} visiting Alanya, Turkey, {{based on the}} analysis of quantitative and qualitative data gathered through structured self-administrated questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. Employing {{a convenience sample of}} 505 holidaymakers visiting a coastal holiday resort in the Mediterranean, the thesis provides a destination-based analysis of the tourist experience process in three analytical phases. Utilising qualitative and quantitative techniques, the study investigates and addresses, in particular, two specific issues: Motivators, constraints and facilitators of holiday choice; and evaluation of holiday/destination behaviour and experiences. The underlying characteristic of Alanya holiday was found to be seeking 'fun in the sun'. ‗Being away‘ was more important than ‗being there‘ as long as sunny weather and the 'right price‘ were guaranteed. Coastal pleasures dominated the holiday activity, and social and cultural contacts were also significant. Motivations, constraints and facilitators were significant determinants of holiday choice and holiday activity patterns. <b>Supporting</b> <b>consumption</b> experiences were the facilitators of peak experiences. Both peak and <b>supporting</b> <b>consumption</b> experiences were crucial in combination for holidaymakers‘ satisfaction. Preferences and perceptions indicated both similarities and differences between holidaymakers. Differences that are rather more significant were based on repeat visitation patterns. Socio-demographic characteristics were more significant for pre-and on-site experience phases. Trip characteristics were more significant for on-site- and post-experience phases. This study adds substantially to our understanding of tourist motivations, behaviours and experiences and provides additional evidence in terms of their complexity and heterogeneity. Demonstrating the relevance of peak touristic experiences and <b>supporting</b> <b>consumption</b> experiences, the study highlighted the importance of the constraints/facilitators, on the structural, interpersonal and intrapersonal levels. Using mixed methods research design and studying three phases of the tourist experience process simultaneously, the study provides both a theoretical and a methodological base for future research. The study has important implications for the management and marketing of destination experiences.

40|$|Since 2009, {{wealth in}} the U. S. farm sector has surged along with booming {{farmland}} values. Similar to nonfarm households, farm enterprises historically have used wealth to <b>support</b> <b>consumption</b> and investments when income fades. During years of low income, farmers tap their existing wealth to finance spending on capital investments such as buildings, vehicles, machinery and other equipment. Thus, similar to nonfarm households, the wealth effect often leads to sharp increases in debt and leverage in farm enterprises. Historically, the sharp accumulation of debt has preceded financial crises. After farm booms in the 1910 s and 1970 s, lower incomes and higher interest rates contributed to farm financial crises and waves of farm bankruptcies during the 1920 s and 1980 s. Risin...|$|E

Using his many film appearances as well as ethnographic notes from a full day workshop with Salatin as data, this paper explores how Salatin’s celebrity status obscures many of the challenges facing food activists behind the veneer of the charming, folksy farmer and the rhetoric of freedom (freedom from the corporate food system and corrupt government practices). The tensions between Salatin’s free-market, anti-regulation politics and the mainstream environmental movement, we argue, are managed and contained through nostalgic images of Salatin as the white, male, yeoman farmer and the masculinization of sustainability. By using an appeal to traditional masculinities to market sustainable food to the mainstream, Salatin’s celebrity (like all celebrity identities) works to <b>support</b> <b>consumption</b> and market-driven solutions to current environmental and food justice crises.
