5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by <b>septic</b> <b>shock.</b> During <b>septic</b> <b>shock,</b> TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. <b>Septic</b> <b>shock</b> can lead to death.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} findings typically include jaundice {{and right}} upper quadrant tenderness. Charcot's triad {{is a set}} of three common findings in cholangitis: abdominal pain, jaundice, and fever. This was assumed in the past to be present in 50–70% of cases, although more recently the frequency has been reported as 15–20%. Reynolds' pentad includes the findings of Charcot's triad with the presence of <b>septic</b> <b>shock</b> and mental confusion. This combination of symptoms indicates worsening of the condition and the development of sepsis, and is seen less commonly still.|$|E
25|$|In the CORTICUS study, {{hydrocortisone}} hastened {{the reversal}} of <b>septic</b> <b>shock,</b> but did not influence mortality, with an increased occurrence of <b>septic</b> <b>shock</b> relapse and hypernatremia. The latter findings tempered enthusiasm for the broad use of hydrocortisone in <b>septic</b> <b>shock.</b> Prior to this study, several other smaller studies showed beneficial effects of long courses of low doses of corticoid. Several factors (such as lack of statistical power due to slow recruitment) could have led a false-negative finding on mortality in the CORTICUS study; thus, more research is needed.|$|E

30|$|Introduction Toxic <b>shocks</b> (TS) and <b>septic</b> <b>shocks</b> (SS) {{share many}} common {{clinical}} {{signs of an}} exacerbated inflammatory response but with different pathophysiological mechanisms.

30|$|Conclusion: Hyperosmolar {{states are}} an {{independent}} a prognosis factor. Intubation and ventilation, vasoactive drugs and antibiotic therapy increases considerably in hyperosmolar states. Furthermore, it induced serious complications as nosocomial infections and <b>septic</b> <b>shocks</b> that further aggravate the prognosis even within hyperosmolar states.|$|R

25|$|There {{are four}} types of {{distributive}} shock. The most common, <b>septic</b> <b>shock,</b> is caused by an infection, most frequently by bacteria, but viruses, fungi and parasites have been implicated. Infection sites most {{likely to lead to}} <b>septic</b> <b>shock</b> are chest, abdomen and genitourinary tract. In <b>septic</b> <b>shock</b> the blood flow in the microvasculature is abnormal with some capillaries underperfused and others with normal to high blood flow. The endothelial cells lining the blood vessels become less responsive to vasocontrictive agents, lose their glycocalyx (normal coating) and negative ionic charge, become leaky and cause extensive over-expression of nitric oxide. The coagulation cascade is also disrupted. Tissue factor that initiates the clotting cascade is produced by activated monocytes and the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels while antithrombin and fibrinolysis are impaired. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can result from the thrombin produced in the inflammatory response. The ability of red blood cells to change shape decreases and their tendency to clump together increases, inhibiting their flow through the microvasculature.|$|E
30|$|Introduction: Early {{administration}} of appropriate antibiotic therapy with adequate concentration {{is the cornerstone}} of the severe sepsis and <b>septic</b> <b>shock’s</b> treatment. Adult studies showed alteration of distribution and elimination which can lead to insufficient drug concentration in septic patients.

40|$|Mortality {{incidence}} predictor {{used for}} sepsis and <b>shock</b> <b>septic</b> in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were measured using Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, which needs many complex examinations. The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine lactate clearance as an alternative mortality predictor. Decreased percentage of lactate clearance is related to poor perfusion in microcirculation which leads to the possibility that lactate clearance can be used to predict mortality incidence in severe sepsis and <b>shock</b> <b>septic</b> patients in the ICU of Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung. This was a prospective observational cohort study involving 51 patients who met sepsis and <b>shock</b> <b>septic</b> criteria during the period of September to November 2015. Lactate was examined continuously in all patients at first hour (H 0) and H 24 and then the lactate clearance value was measured using the following formula: lactate initial–lactate delayed/lactate initial x 100 %. Subjects were divided into two groups according to the low lactate clearance(40 %). The Mann Whitney test was used for numeric data and exact Fisher test was used for categorical data. Results showed that the lactate clearance had a sensitivity of 100 %, specificity of 88. 4 %, positive predictive value of 89. 2 %, negative predictive value of 100 %, likelihood ratio positive of 86. 6 %, likelihood ratio negative of 0 % and accuracy of 94. 11 %. Thus, lactate clearance can be used to predict mortality incidence in severe sepsis and <b>shock</b> <b>septic</b> patients...|$|R

30|$|A {{beneficial}} {{association between}} metformin and mortality has been already described both in selected {{patients with chronic}} heart failure [11], liver disease [12, 13], mild-to-moderate kidney failure [14] which are usual contraindications, and in ICU patients [3]. In this latter study, based on retrospective analysis of Northern Denmark database, 30 -day mortality was lower in metformin users than in non-metformin users with adjusted hazard ratio =  0.8 (95 % confidence interval 0.71 – 0.95). Propensity-score-matched analyses yielded the same results. In our work, more than 90 % were medical admissions, whereas two-thirds of the 7404 ICU patients with type 2 diabetes in Christiansen et al.’s study were surgical admissions. However, no data were available concerning <b>septic</b> <b>shocks,</b> vasopressor dosages or even blood lactate levels. Mechanisms of this beneficial effect remain unclear: in ICU patients, metformin may supply higher amounts of lactate serving as an energetic carbon source and therefore is available for ischaemic tissues with glucose preservation. Metformin may also decrease cellular hypoxia of less perfused tissues by decreasing oxygen consumption.|$|R
40|$|Background: The cardiac correlates, if any, of N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) {{levels in}} <b>septic</b> and non-septic <b>shock</b> {{patients}} remain controversial. Methods: In the 38 septic and 22 non-septic shock {{patients in the}} transpulmonary thermodilution arm of a previous 2 -center randomized controlled trial comparing pulmonary artery catheterization with transpulmonary thermodilution, serial (daily for 3  days) and paired measurements (n =  145) were obtained of NT-proBNP and transpulmonary dilution variables as global ejection fraction (GEF), left ventricular preload-recruitable stroke work (PRSW) and diastolic compliance. Results: Elevated NT-proBNP inversely related to low GEF and PRSW in pooled data (r = − 0. 45, P <  0. 001). The 72  h course of NT-proBNP was inversely associated with PRSW, independent of age, gender, creatinine, norepinephrine treatment and diastolic compliance, without differences between <b>septic</b> and non-septic <b>shock.</b> Over the 72  h study period, NT-proBNP levels were higher in 28  day non-survivors than survivors, independent of type of shock and disease severity. Conclusions: In <b>septic</b> and non-septic <b>shock,</b> NT-proBNP elevations reflect systolic left ventricular dysfunction and {{are associated with a}} poor outcome. They may help recognition of cardiac dysfunction in shock and its management when invasive hemodynamic monitoring is not yet instituted...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} combined with computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) offers an excellent negative predictive value. Consequently, it is a reliable tool for excluding an infectious phenomenon in case of negativity. In case of persistent fever of unknown origin after cardiac surgery and {{in combination with other}} bacteriological examinations and medical imaging, we can rely on FDG-PET/CT to confirm or eliminate deep infections and prosthetic endocarditis. For this reason, FDG-PET/CT should be considered among the examinations to be performed in case of suspected infection after cardiac surgery. We have reported the case of a 76 -year-old man who presented with a fever of unknown origin and recurrent <b>septic</b> <b>shocks</b> after a biological Bentall procedure combined with left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery revascularization by the left internal thoracic artery. We performed a FDG-PET/CT which showed external iliac vein and right common femoral vein hyperfixation with infiltration of adjacent soft tissues, highly suspected to be an infectious process. Learning objectiveThe aim of this case report is to show that FDG-PET/CT, in combination with other bacteriological examinations and medical imaging, can be extremely helpful in detecting deep infectious sources, even during the early postoperative period...|$|R

40|$|Twinning of {{crystals}} causes overlapping {{of two or}} more {{reciprocal lattice}} points, and hence structure amplitudes for a single crystalline domain are hardly obtained from X-ray diffraction intensities. MD- 2 protein forms a stable complex with Toll-like receptor 4 and recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Excessive immune responses activated by LPS cause <b>septic</b> <b>shocks.</b> Saccharide-trimmed human MD- 2 crystallizes in the tetragonal form with apparent Laue symmetry of 4 /mmm, and diffraction intensities from these crystals indicate crystal twinning. The crystal consists of two different domains, A and B. The cA axis of domain A coincides with the cB axis of domain B with a smaller lattice, and the aA axis corresponds to the (aB + bB) axis. This twinning severely imposes difficulty in structure determination. Through optimization of cryoprotectant, domain A was thoroughly transformed into domain B. The crystal containing only domain B is in space group P 41212 with one MD- 2 molecule in the asymmetric unit. The structure of this form of MD- 2 as well as its complex with antiendotoxic lipid IVa was successfully determined using the multiple isomorphous replacement method...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}}  case of Fournier’s {{gangrene}} disease in  a young obese patient with coexistent B-lymphoma. It remains controversial if obesity constitutes a  predisposing factor {{for an individual}} to develop necrotizing fasciitis. On the other hand, only few cases of patients with coexistence of B-lymphoma and Fournier’s gangrene disease have been reported. [*]A 30 -years-old obese man was admitted to emergency department with fever (38. 7 °C), pain, erythema and swelling extended from the left scrotum to the left lower abdominal quadrant. He was confused, with low urinary excretion and <b>septic</b> <b>shock’s</b> signs. The clinical findings were characteristics of Fournier’s gangrene disease. Furthermore during physical examination a  massive, painless and motionless mass in  the left breast was revealed. The patient required urgent surgical debridement of the affected area and pus drainage. Biopsies of the breast mass were received by excision. Pus and blood cultures yielded Staphylococci coagulase(–), Klebsiella and Proteus sp. Intravenous antibiotic treatment with Meropeneme and Clindamycine started immediately. Repeated debridement was often performed. Pathology examination of the massive tissue revealed a  diffuse B-lymphoma of large cells (Germinal center B-cell like-GCB). The patient was discharged from the hospital 35 days later. [*]Afterwards, he was treated with chemotherapeutic agents for malignant lymphoma at the oncological department. The aim of this case’s presentation is to mention that young obese patients with Fournier’s gangrene disease should be particularly investigated due to the possible occurrence of another not obvious predisposing factor, such as a  malignant disease...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe first French transapical transcatheter {{aortic valve}} {{implantation}} (TAVI) {{was performed in}} July 2007 in our department. AimsTo report 4 -year outcomes of transapical implantation with the Edwards transcatheter bioprosthesis. MethodsWe prospectively evaluated consecutive patients who underwent transapical implantation with an Edwards transcatheter bioprosthesis between July 2007 and October 2011. Patients were not suitable for conventional surgery (due to severe comorbidities) or transfemoral implantation (due to poor femoral access). ResultsAmong 61 patients (59. 0 % men), mean logistic EuroSCORE was 27. 5 ± 14. 9 % and mean age was 81. 0 ± 6. 8 years. Successful valve implantation was achieved in 59 / 61 patients (96. 7 %) of patients. The other two patients required conversion to conventional surgery due to prosthesis embolization and died. Six additional patients died in the postoperative period. Causes of perioperative death were two <b>septic</b> <b>shocks</b> (one of peritonitis), two multi-organ failure, one ventricular fibrillation and one respiratory insufficiency. Intraprocedural stroke was not observed in any patient. The actuarial survival rates at 1, 2 and 4 years were 73. 8 %, 67. 2 % and 41. 0 %. During this 4 -year period, four patients died of cardiovascular events, but no impairment of transprosthesis gradient was observed. ConclusionOur series of 61 patients who underwent transapical implantation of the Edwards transcatheter bioprosthesis shows satisfactory results, similar to other reports, considering {{the high level of}} severity of patients referred for this method. Transapical access is a reliable alternative method for patients that cannot benefit from a transfemoral approach...|$|R
