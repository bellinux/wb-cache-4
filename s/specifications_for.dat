5|$|Some USB devices {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by the <b>specifications</b> <b>for</b> a single port.

Such devices can use an external power supply, which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.|$|E
