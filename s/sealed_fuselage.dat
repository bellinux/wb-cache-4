25|$|In 1955, Stroukoff, under {{contract}} from the USAF, produced a single YC-123E, designed {{to be able to}} take off from any surface, and also equipped with BLC. The new aircraft also featured Stroukoff's Pantobase system, combining a ski system with a <b>sealed</b> <b>fuselage</b> and wing mounted floats, while retaining its normal landing gear. The skis worked both on snow and water, and the system effectively allowed the aircraft to land on water, land, snow or ice.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} 1920, the British trade journal, ″Flying,″ {{reported}} conversations between the First Sea Lord {{and other military}} leaders {{and one of the}} principal aircraft manufacturers concerning a flying submarine (or submersible seaplane). The all-metal craft, its hypothetical design illustrated in the article, was to be a twin-propeller airplane with retractable wings and a hermetically <b>sealed</b> <b>fuselage.</b> There was, however, apparently no further development of the project.|$|E

50|$|The YC-123E {{had been}} another {{experiment}} {{in improving the}} C-123's ability to operate wherever it might need to, introducing Stroukoff's own Pantobase system: two high-stress skis fitted to the lower fuselage, wingtip mounted floats, along with <b>sealing</b> the <b>fuselage</b> itself. This gave the YC-123E the ability to operate on water, as well as ice and snow, and with the BLC from the previous YC-123D, the new aircraft could effectively be operated from almost any runway surface available, and airstrips of shorter length.|$|R
2500|$|While early Mk VIIs were {{fitted with}} a {{detachable}} canopy, secured by four pilot operated catches, later Mk VIIs were {{fitted with a}} [...] "Lobelle" [...] type hood which opened by sliding backwards, as on non-pressurised versions of the Spitfire. This was a big improvement on the clamp down cockpit of the Mk VI. The canopy was double-glazed and used rubber tubing to create a proper pressure <b>seal</b> against the <b>fuselage.</b> The canopy rails were bulkier than the standard Spitfire type.|$|R
50|$|The MOMBA 2C had a pod and {{boom type}} fuselage. The pilot's seat was just {{forward of the}} wing leading edge, placing him in a {{reclining}} position under a long, single piece canopy, shaped from an uncut Slingsby Kestrel moulding. The cockpit had some unusual features, principally that access to it was by rolling the whole nosecone and canopy forwards along a rail from a join around the fuselage ahead of the wing. This provided an aerodynamically very clean and well <b>sealed</b> forward <b>fuselage,</b> as well as easy access for instrument panel servicing. The control column was side mounted on a raised side beam on the right; flap and undercarriage levers were similarly mounted on the other side. This arrangement avoided underfloor control cables, keeping the fuselage cross section low and simplifying the control linkages. The cockpit was narrow and low {{and would not have}} been comfortable for bigger pilots than Sunderland. The nosecone was skinned with glass cloth over balsa. Instrument panel, controls, seat and the retractable monowheel undercarriage were supported by a central, sturdy, sheet alloy frame linked to the wing. The fuselage tapered from the leading edge aft, an area covered glass cloth over PVC foam. Behind this the boom was a roughly oval metal tube, with flat top and bottom plates for ease of construction. Tail surfaces were all straight edged; the tall, metal skinned fin had a slightly swept GRP leading edge and carried a tapered, fabric covered rudder. The MOMBA 2C had a T-tail, with a metal surfaced, high aspect ratio, tapered tailplane and a plywood surfaced elevator. There was a small, semi-recessed tailwheel below the fin.|$|R
