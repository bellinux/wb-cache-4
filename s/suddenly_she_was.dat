500|$|The {{first of}} twenty-eight books in Blyton's Old Thatch series, The Talking Teapot and Other Tales, was {{published}} in 1934, {{the same year as}} the first book in her Brer Rabbit series, Brer Rabbit Retold; (note that Brer Rabbit originally featured in Uncle Remus stories by Joel Chandler Harris), her first serial story and first full-length book, Adventures of the Wishing-Chair, followed in 1937. The Enchanted Wood, the first book in the Faraway Tree series, published in 1939, is about a magic tree inspired by the Norse mythology that had fascinated Blyton as a child. According to Blyton's daughter Gillian the inspiration for the magic tree came from [...] "thinking up a story one day and <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> walking in the enchanted wood and found the tree. In her imagination she climbed up through the branches and met Moon-Face, Silky, the Saucepan Man {{and the rest of the}} characters. She had all she needed." [...] As in the Wishing-Chair series, these fantasy books typically involve children being transported into a magical world in which they meet fairies, goblins, elves, pixies and other mythological creatures.|$|E
2500|$|... "You {{have all}} these great stories in the book," [...] I told her, [...] "Why don't you use them in the song?" [...] I knew that Madonna was {{developing}} a 1930s dominatrix look for Erotica, but I didn't realize how far {{she was willing to}} go before I saw Sex. It contained stories authored by her mysteriously dark alter, Dita. Madonna took the book {{and walked out of the}} room and didn't come back until about half an hour later. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> on the mic, speaking in this very dry voice. [...] "My name is Dita," [...] she said, [...] "and I'll be your mistress tonight." [...] I knew that the original [...] "Erotica" [...] would never be the same again, and it wasn't. The chorus and bridge were changed entirely and the whole psyche of the song became sexier, more to the point. It seemed as if Dita brought out the best in her, actually serving as a vehicle for the dangerous territory she was traveling. Actually, it was the same name Madonna used when she'd stay in hotels around the world. Not anymore.|$|E
2500|$|Lexa is {{the first}} Grounder leader to seek peace, which Debnam-Carey {{described}} as [...] "somewhat difficult" [...] for the other Grounders to understand because of their [...] "rough and aggressive" [...] culture; she is also [...] "the first person to unite the 12 clans and to actually {{have the option of}} an alliance." [...] Throughout, she is extremely loyal, but more so to her own people; she puts them first regardless of the cost. Debnam-Carey said [...] "it's in [...] blood" [...] to put her people first because they [...] "are so close to her, that's what she's been groomed to be. She comes from a really harsh culture and she has huge responsibilities." [...] Lexa is [...] "brutal and she's a pragmatist, but not out of unkindness. It's all she's ever known." [...] Debnam-Carey did not view Lexa as a teenager, and did not assign her an age, stating, [...] "It's almost like she skipped that period. She was placed in a position where <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> forced {{to make a lot of}} hard choices that most people never have to make, no matter what their age is. The 100 is a world where you don't ever really get to be a kid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mlle. Mars," [...] {{he gasped}} breathlessly; [...] "she {{has been taken}} ill--on the stage--very <b>suddenly.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> in the wings--asking for her maid. They think she will faint." ...|$|R
60|$|And, {{seeing her}} smile, he felt <b>suddenly</b> relieved. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> really {{glad to see}} him, perhaps.|$|R
50|$|Molly <b>suddenly</b> realizes <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{the only}} one who has seen Tim and {{something}} is happening to her.|$|R
2500|$|In the September 1, 1995, {{article for}} the Shambhala Sun, [...] "bell hooks talks to John Perry Barlow", Barlow {{reflects}} upon Cynthia Horner passing away: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} what we’re here to do is to learn about love in the presence of fear... You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the sound of her voice, or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that you and I were dancing up in your apartment a few months ago. And <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in you and I could feel her there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Suddenly</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> gone. With one mighty {{effort and}} a last terrified look round, she popped into a pawnshop.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Belding's {{strained}} face {{underwent a}} swift and mobile relaxation, and <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> weeping in strangely mingled happiness and bitterness.|$|E
60|$|Her temper had <b>suddenly</b> changed; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{smiling and}} gracious and bright- eyed, {{and full of}} rich colour again.|$|R
50|$|<b>Suddenly</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> menaced by alienating, enigmatic calls {{whenever}} <b>she</b> <b>is</b> on air.

Jeanne {{turns to her}} brother Frank, who is a policeman. Frank finds out that the convicted murderer of their parents was released just recently.

50|$|In 1791 {{her mental}} {{condition}} <b>suddenly</b> worsened. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> admitted to Bethlem Hospital on 20 August. She died on 8 February 1792.|$|R
60|$|<b>Suddenly</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{smitten with}} a new idea, and stared for some time at her fellow-slave. At last she got it out.|$|E
60|$|She leaned forward, incredulity {{swept across}} her countenance. Then her eyes kindled, and the colour came {{creeping}} {{back into her}} pale cheeks. She rose <b>suddenly.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> trembling.|$|E
60|$|<b>Suddenly</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{awakened to}} full {{consciousness}} by seeing {{a light in}} the room. No, {{it was not the}} maid putting away her dresses. It was Janet, bending over her mother's davenport.|$|E
60|$|His face <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> transformed. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> almost {{afraid of}} the effect of her words. She found herself {{struggling}} in his arms.|$|R
60|$|Her face <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> grave. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{standing}} {{by his side}} with her hands loosely clasped behind her, her eyes upturned to his.|$|R

She suspects Sean has something to do with it but has no proof.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> weeping like a {{child that}} is teased; her troubled eyes looked out from under {{puckered}} brows. [...] "You don't mean it," [...] she said. [...] "You don't mean it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Suddenly</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> weeping {{with all}} the unconcealed {{distressing}} grief of a disappointed child. She put her pretty be-ringed little {{hands in front of}} her face and recited the accumulation of her woes.|$|E
60|$|The {{course that}} the Spaniard was taking {{would have brought}} her just under {{the stern of the}} Antelope when, <b>suddenly,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> seen to change her course, and to bear up into the wind.|$|E

50|$|The video {{starts with}} {{pictures}} wherein {{a photo of}} Nina {{walking on the street}} is slowly zoomed, as the image inside the picture starts moving. <b>She</b> <b>suddenly</b> stopped and leaned on a wall. A scene where <b>she</b> <b>is</b> singing to the song, while a colorful background is moving behind her, <b>suddenly</b> appears. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> then shown walking on the streets of San Francisco, California, where other people stroll as well (but in a fast-forward motion).

60|$|Mrs. Falconer paused <b>suddenly.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> a very truthful {{woman and}} she {{instantly}} realized that that last sentence was not true. She {{was not doing}} all she could for Camilla--she would not be glad, she feared, to do all she could.|$|E
60|$|She {{performed}} this feat quite <b>suddenly.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> a {{young girl}} when she first came to us, and we had never considered her as anything else, when one evening she had a young man to see her. Then we knew she had grown up.|$|E
60|$|<b>Suddenly</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{moved by}} inspiration. He had gained an {{advantage}} before, by retreating through a doorway into an inner room. Might he {{not do the}} same again, and be in better case {{if he were to}} retreat now to her own chamber? Impulsively she called to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle, I smell {{a frying}} {{sort of a}} smell," [...] Rose said, pausing <b>suddenly</b> as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> putting away {{the remains of the}} lunch half an hour later.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, Diana {{puts the}} people on rooftops {{to protect them from}} the flood. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{attacked}} by Lisa Jennings, who claims she ruined everything.

Diana is forced to let Jennings go to save more people.|$|R
60|$|Undaunted, {{she looked}} at him with eyes that froze his trigger-finger, whilst behind her Rizzio grovelled in his terror, {{clutching}} her petticoat. Thus, until <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> seized about the waist and half dragged, half-lifted aside by Darnley, who at the same time spurned Rizzio forward with his foot.|$|E
6000|$|And <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{no longer}} a stranger, but the girl who had flitted to his arms breathless, unhesitating, through the dusk. His blood quickened. He made an awkward gesture as though he arrested an impulse to touch her. [...] "My sweetheart," [...] he said. [...] "My dear one!" ...|$|E
60|$|Mary {{came down}} the hill like a runaway steam-engine. It was tremendously exciting, this blind rush through the dark; she felt she would never stop. But the ground grew level beneath her feet, her speed insensibly slackened, and <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> caught by an {{extended}} arm and brought to an abrupt halt.|$|E
