[...] School of Education and Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2012 This study explored the mathematical problem-solving styles {{of middle school}} and high school deaf and hard-of-hearing students and the mathematical problem-solving styles of the mathematics teachers of {{middle school and high}} school deaf and hard-of-hearing students. The research involved 45 deaf and hard-of-hearing students and 19 teachers from a Midwestern state residential school for the deaf and hard-of-hearing and from the public school district which surrounds the residential school. This research utilized the framework of mathematical problem-solving styles, based on the work of Dr. Steve Chinn and others. Mathematical problem-solving styles are related to the types of strategies used when approaching mathematical tasks. On one end of the spectrum there are strategies which approach mathematics in a formulaic way, using <b>step-by-step</b> <b>approaches</b> to solving mathematical problems. On the other end of the spectrum there are strategies which approach mathematics from a holistic perspective, making use of patterns and relationships. The results showed that, in general, the students demonstrated a strong tendency toward the use of formulaic <b>step-by-step</b> <b>approaches</b> in solving mathematical problems, while the teachers tended to use both <b>step-by-step</b> <b>approaches</b> and holistic approaches involving mathematical patterns and relationships. No significant difference in mathematical problem-solving style was found between deaf and hard-of-hearing students in residential educational settings and deaf and hard-of-hearing students in mainstream educational settings, or between teachers in residential settings and teachers in mainstream settings. A very weak linear relationship, however, was identified linking students who had spent a larger proportion of their education in residential settings for the deaf and hard-of-hearing with a greater tendency for <b>step-by-step</b> formulaic <b>approaches.</b> Among the teachers, a weak linear relationship was identified that linked more years of teaching experience with a greater tendency toward holistic approaches. It was also found that mathematics teachers utilized more holistic approaches while special education resource teachers (who taught mathematics to deaf and hard-of-hearing students) used more <b>step-by-step</b> <b>approaches.</b> It was further discovered that teachers who had completed at least one course at the calculus level utilized more holistic approaches involving patterns and mathematical relationships than teachers who had completed only mathematics courses below calculus.

The other Bodhisattvas enshrined along with the main deity were of Maitreya, Manjushri, Amatyas, Bhavishyaguru, Tsongkhapa (with his students), Dalai Lama VII, Pawanga Rinpoche and several other past teachers of the college.|$|E

In the years since 1967 the emphasis in Washington has shifted from the spelling out of the ingredients of [...] "peace" [...] to the [...] "process" [...] of getting there. … Much of US constitutional theory focuses on how issues should be resolved – the process – rather than on substance – what should be done. … The United States has provided both a sense of direction and a mechanism. That, at its best, is what the peace process has been about. At worst, it has been little more than a slogan used to mask the marking of time.|$|E

5000|$|A {{limitation}} of <b>step-by-step</b> <b>approaches</b> {{is that they}} divorce transitions from the larger {{chain of events that}} precede and follow those transitions. To draw on an example from the [...] Chicago school of sociology, Robert E. Park’s “race-relations cycle” argued that conflict often results when two race groups are exposed to each other. Over time, this often gives way to peaceful coexistence. But this is more likely if inter-group relations involve a gradual development from competition and conflict to accommodation and assimilation. It is less likely if relations fluctuate between positive and negative, as this yields instability and distrust. Only by studying the “whole” sequence of relations is it possible to understand the social context in which future social phenomena may unfold. The whole sequence provides a richer historical context than information about a single antecedent state can provide.|$|R

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{preservation}} of ancient masonry structures, damage evaluation and monitoring procedures are particularly attractive, due to the modern context of minimum repair and observational methods, with iterative and <b>step-by-step</b> <b>approaches.</b> High-priority research issues related to damage assessment and monitoring are global non-contact inspection techniques, sensor technology, data management, diagnostics (decision making and simulation), dynamic (modal) analysis, self-diagnosing / self-healing materials, and prediction of early degradation. On these concerns, the present paper aims to assess damage in masonry structures at an early stage. Replicates of historical constructions were built in virgin state. Afterwards, progressive damage was applied and modal identification analysis was performed at each damage stage, aiming at finding adequate correspondence between dynamic behavior and internal crack growth. Accelerations and dynamic strains were recorded in many points of the replicates. Comparisons between different techniques based on vibrations measurements are made to evaluate different damage identification methods...|$|R
