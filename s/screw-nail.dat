Intramedullary nailing is the updated version of the Küntscher Y nail and provides stable osteosynthesis of trochanteric hip fractures, classically achieved by closed reduction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We report on our experience (which started in 2003), using a new fixation device featuring a metaphyseal antegrade nail locked with two cephalic screws and comprising a diaphyseal distal locking. Between April 2003 and September 2006, the first 100 patients who sustained an extracapsular intertrochanteric hip fracture and indicated for internal fixation were prospectively enrolled in this single-center study. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients (mean age 80. 3) were reviewed at 6 months (nine had died, three had failure and two were lost to follow-up) and reported a satisfactory functional outcome (mean Merle d'Aubigné score was 16 and mean Harris Hip score was 90). Union was achieved within a mean delay of 3 months (median 102 days 1 / 2) in a good anatomical position (mean medialization was 1. 86 - ranging from - 16 to 0 mm, and mean shortening was 1. 72 mm - ranging from 0 to 24 mm). Functional recovery was satisfactory with a mean Parker score of 7. 52. Total operating time was shortened and good fracture stabilization allowed early weight bearing. DISCUSSION: Classically, such intertrochanteric fractures can be managed either with a dynamic screw-plate type fixation or with an intramedullary nailing device locked through a single cephalic screw and finally, in rare cases, with a hip arthroplasty supplemented with some sort of fixation. Most published clinical studies of screw-plate fixations have generally reported satisfactory results except for unstable fractures associated with a calcar area lesion. <b>Screw-nail</b> fixations featuring a single cephalic screw should be used in these latter fracture patterns. We believe this new implant design will significantly enhance the anatomical result and functional outcome of these fractures; all this is expected to bring about an earlier recovery of patient's walking ability. CONCLUSION: This original intramedullary nailing system provides reliable internal fixation means for intertrochanteric fractures since it combines the advantage of a closed reduction procedure with a more stable biomechanical construct...|$|E

6000|$|... "Hoot, man, {{never mind}} the <b>screw-nails.</b> We can easy send back for it. But, wow! there's a far grander place we're comin' in sight of--an'--iss that an Indian tent I see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish {{your message}} had been verbal, boy. It's so {{difficult}} to read ladies' hands; they're so abominably angular, and--where are my specs? I've a mind to have 'em <b>screw-nailed</b> to my nose. Ah! here they are." ...|$|R
60|$|Deeming it {{important}} to open the campaign by putting a good taste in the mouths of his friends the Indians, he began by distributing a few gratuities to them--some coloured beads to the women, and a few lines, fish-hooks, and tobacco to the men. Then he marked out a site for the future dwelling-house and store, got out the tools and set to work to fell, saw, and shape suitable timber for the buildings. He constituted Magadar chief hunter to the establishment, supplied him with a new gun, powder and ball, and sent him off to the woods as proud as, and doubtless much happier than, a king. Mozwa he kept by him, as a counsellor to whom he could appeal in all matters regarding {{the region and the}} people, as well as an overseer of those among his countrymen who were hired to render assistance. Alizay was sent off in a canoe--much to the satisfaction of Mowat--for that forgotten keg of <b>screw-nails</b> which had lain so heavy on his mind, and the old chief was supplied with unlimited tobacco, and allowed to wander about at will, under the agreeable impression that he was superintendent-general of the works. Isquay, Idazoo, {{and some of the other}} women were furnished with moose-deer skins and needles, and employed to make moccasins for the men, as well as to do all the needful repairs to garments.|$|R
60|$|As {{the general}} amazement subsided, Mr. Oldbuck, whose heart bled to witness what he {{considered}} as the errings of the enfeebled intellect struggling with the torpid chill of age and of sorrow, observed to the clergyman {{that it was time}} to proceed with the ceremony. The father was incapable of giving directions, but the nearest relation of the family made a sign to the carpenter, who in such cases goes through the duty of the undertaker, to proceed in his office. The creak of the <b>screw-nails</b> presently announced that the lid of the last mansion of mortality was in the act of being secured above its tenant. The last act which separates us for ever, even from the mortal relies of the person we assemble to mourn, has usually its effect upon the most indifferent, selfish, and hard-hearted. With a spirit of contradiction, which we may be pardoned for esteeming narrow-minded, the fathers of the Scottish kirk rejected, even on this most solemn occasion, the form of an address to the Divinity, lest they should be thought to give countenance to the rituals of Rome or of England. With much better and more liberal judgment, it is the present practice of most of the Scottish clergymen to seize this opportunity of offering a prayer, and exhortation, suitable to make an impression upon the living, while they are yet in the very presence of the relics of him whom they have but lately seen such as they themselves, and who now is such as they must in their time become. But this decent and praiseworthy practice was not adopted at the time of which I am treating, or at least, Mr. Blattergowl did not act upon it, and the ceremony proceeded without any devotional exercise.|$|R
