50|$|The {{role the}} FRS plays in EPA {{is to provide}} an accurate, {{authoritative}} facility record. The European model of environmental regulation is for facilities to be assigned a number when the plant created, and all permits are linked to that number. The U.S. environmental regulatory system is based on multiple environmental laws, with somewhat varying <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions.</b> The separate regulatory system established under each law contributes its separate set of permit information to a central data system, which has to match the facility records based on the business rules outlined above. Further complicating the issue, many programs use self-reported information, which encourages gaming the system to reduce the apparent environmental impact of a production facility. One other structural problem is that many environmental programs are delegated to the states, which further complicates facility interaction at the federal level. These structural problems prevent EPA from having as complete a picture of American pollution as its European counterparts.|$|E

40|$|With the {{expansion}} of organized crime in Central America, the countries in this continental sub-region have enacted {{a great deal of}} internal legislation, and have ratified international treaties at the universal, regional and Central American level, particularly after the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime took effect in 2000. This abundance of laws is very positive, and is an expression of these Central American States’ intent to fulfill their supranational obligations and provide security for their inhabitants. However, it is also negative in that it has led to dispersion, dislocation, discrepancies and inaccuracies regarding the prevailing legal regulations, because national laws have been developed with different concepts, structures, approaches, <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions.</b> Despite these conditions that are adverse to legal harmonization, Central America can move forward with matching its legislation against organized crime.

This will assist in the reduction of negative impacts of the, public procurement of these services, on the environment, human health and natural resources. The revision of EU GPP requires in-depth information about the technical and environmental performance of the service group as well as about the current procurement processes. The scientific body of evidence gathered will be cross-checked with sector experienced stakeholders, to develop consensus on how the criteria should be revised to deliver optimum environmental improvements. This Report {{which will be the}} basis for producing the draft EU GPP criteria proposals that will be discussed in the Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG) meetings. Chapter 1 focuses on the definition for and scoping of Food and Catering Services to overview of the different <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>definitions</b> and to narrow down the services in order to obtain a homogenous scope. Chapter 2, market analysis, presents the market overview and the market structure by focusing on the contract catering market. The environmental analysis (Chapter 3) provides a detail analysis of the main environmental hotspots for the food product categories by reviewing a number of LCA studies. Other non-LCA aspects including ethical and health consideration are also summarised. The technical analysis focus on the current schemes and labels identified as important for the revision of the current EU GPP criteria.

Despite a reasonably sustained focus upon the career, exploits and tactical brilliance of Scipio Africanus during the Hannibalic War, modern scholarship has neglected the apparent abandonment of his tactical reforms by the Roman army during the following half century. This project focuses upon the development of tactical doctrine within the Roman army throughout the Hannibalic and Macedonian Wars. The project's aims are to establish with certainty the nature and scope of Scipio Africanus' tactical reforms, that they constituted a widely applicable alteration to tactical doctrine, and, finally, whether this reform program was abandoned in the Second and Third Macedonian Wars. These aims are addressed by a comparison of six set piece engagements, each critically reexamined by the investigator and based upon ancient source material, {{in order to determine the}} ideal conception by which Roman commanders employed their armies. This comparison found that Scipio’s reforms constituted manifestly superior tactical doctrine, based upon the doctrinal principle of envelopment, which was abandoned by Roman command during operations in Macedonia. The project concluded that the abandonment of said reform program constitutes an informational failure at the organizational level, which may represent a base driver for the relative decline of the Roman military in the second century BCE and thus a partial origin of the Marian reforms.

A life cycle assessment (LCA) {{is often used to}} measure whether, and to what extent, a remanufactured product is ‘better’ for the environment than a newly produced equivalent.

However, for the system boundaries selection in the LCA for remanufacturing the standards and guidelines offer insufficient guidance to practitioners.

40|$|Broadcast journalism's {{foundational}} role of informing {{and engaging}} the American public {{in order to}} further America's self-governing democracy is in crisis. Corporate broadcast owners' efforts to maximize profits and increase advertising revenue during traditional network news and related public affairs programming have led to the closing of many investigative and correspondent television news bureaus and have arguably hastened the devolution of broadcast journalism into a depoliticized spectacle filled with political and celebrity, gossip-driven infotainment. Furthermore, as viewers have abdicated their reliance on broadcast journalism as their primary source of political knowledge, they have also disengaged from professional broadcast journalists' dispassionate, impartial and aspirationally objective method and manner of presentation. This Article contends that these definitional shifts in viewer engagement, which serve as underlying challenges to broadcast journalism's deliberative role, are the symptoms, rather than the root cause of its deliberative peril.
