5|$|In 1887, Tesla {{developed}} an induction motor that ran on alternating current, a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States {{because of its}} advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple <b>self-starting</b> design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E

25|$|A unibit (often {{called a}} step drill bit) is a roughly conical bit with a stairstep profile. Due to its design, a single bit {{can be used}} for {{drilling}} a wide range of hole sizes.

25|$|In 1888, Tesla {{presented}} his paper A New System for Alternating Current Motors and Transformers to the AIEE that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types: {{one with a}} four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor, another with a wound rotor forming a <b>self-starting</b> induction motor, and the third a true synchronous motor with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding.|$|E
25|$|A more {{aggressive}} angle, such as 90 degrees, is suited for very soft plastics and other materials; it would wear rapidly in hard materials. Such a bit is generally <b>self-starting</b> and can cut very quickly. A shallower angle, such as 150 degrees, is suited for drilling steels and other tougher materials. This style of bit requires a starter hole, {{but does not}} bind or suffer premature wear so long as a suitable feed rate is used.|$|E
25|$|An {{induction}} motor is an AC electric motor {{in which the}} electric current in the rotor needed to produce torque is induced by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding instead of using mechanical commutation (brushes) that caused sparking in earlier electric motors. They are also <b>self-starting.</b> The Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla explored {{the idea of using}} a rotating magnetic induction field principle, using it in his invention of a poly-phase {{induction motor}} using alternating current which he received a patent for on May 1, 1888. The rights to Tesla's invention were licensed by George Westinghouse for the AC power system his company was developing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract —  In recent years, email is {{the basic}} service for person to person communication, and email {{facilitates}} by its high speed, and process ability. The email malware exhibits two new propagation features; reinfection and <b>self-start.</b> Reinfection is {{the process by which}} an infected user sends out malware copies, whenever the infected user opens the malicious hyperlink or attachment. <b>Self-Start</b> is the process by which the infected user spreads the malware copies, whenever certain events are triggered. To solve this problem, derive a new analytical model by introducing a concept of virtual nodes. The malware detector serves as an empirical means of evaluating malware detection techniques detection capabilities. The new analytical model can efficiently predict the reinfection detection and effectively overcome the associated computational challenges...|$|R
25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not <b>self-starting.</b> The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|E
500|$|Before a Hammond organ {{can produce}} sound, the motor {{that drives the}} tonewheels must come up to speed. On most models, {{starting}} a Hammond organ involves two switches. The [...] "Start" [...] switch turns a dedicated starter motor, which must run for about 12 seconds. Then, the [...] "Run" [...] switch is turned on for about four seconds. The [...] "Start" [...] switch is then released, whereupon the organ is ready to generate sound. The H-100 and E-series consoles and L-100 and T-100 spinet organs, however, had a <b>self-starting</b> motor that required only a single [...] "On" [...] switch. A pitch bend effect can be created on the Hammond organ by turning the [...] "Run" [...] switch off and on again. This briefly cuts power to the generators, causing them to run {{at a slower pace}} and generate a lower pitch for a short time. Hammond's New B3 contains similar switches to emulate this effect, though it is a digital instrument.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{critical}} security threats imposed by email-based malware in recent years, modeling the propagation dynamics of email malware becomes a fundamental technique for predicting its potential damages and developing effective countermeasures. Compared to earlier versions of email malware, modern email malware exhibits two new features, reinfection and <b>self-start.</b> Reinfection refers to the malware behavior that modern email malware sends out malware copies whenever any healthy or infected recipients open the malicious attachment. <b>Self-start</b> refers to the behavior that malware starts to spread whenever compromised computers restart or certain files are visited. In the literature, several models are proposed for email malware propagation, {{but they did not}} take into account the above two features and cannot accurately model the propagation dynamics of modern email malware. To address this problem, we derive a novel difference equation based analytical model by introducing a new concept of virtual infected user. The proposed model can precisely present the repetitious spreading process caused by reinfection and <b>self-start</b> and effectively overcome the associated computational challenges. We perform comprehensive empirical and theoretical study to validate the proposed analytical model. The results show our model greatly outperforms previous models in terms of estimation accuracy.

40|$|<b>Self-start</b> {{capability}} {{is an important}} feature of wind turbines. It allows to obtain simpler and cheaper turbines not actively controlled. Different approaches to describe the <b>self-start</b> of an H-blade Darrieus rotor are presented and compared in the present work. The Blade Element Momentum (BEM) approach was compared with two and three-dimensional CFD simulations. The tipespeed ratio versus power coefficient curves {{and the evolution of}} the trust forces over a blade revolution highlighted the limits and the strengths of each approach. The BEM model showed remarkable limits to describe to describe the <b>self-start</b> behaviour of the tested geometry. The principal limits of the BEM approach can be ascribed to the absence of well documented aerofoil databases for low Reynolds number and the inadequate modelling of dynamics effects. The 2 D simulation allowed to highlight the unsteady features of the flow fields, and the presence of a complex vortices pattern which interact with the blade. Furthermore the comparison between 2 D and 3 D data demonstrated the importance of 3 D effects such as secondary flows and tip effects. These effects were proved to {{have a positive effect on}} start-up, increasing the torque characteristic for tipespeed ratio of 1. The start-up capability of H-Darrieus appears to be influenced by many different factors, which include secondary flows, three-dimensional aerodynamic effects and the finite aspect-ratio of the blades...|$|R

60|$|And {{so it was}} I went up {{into the}} air at Eastbourne with the {{impression}} that flying was still an uncomfortable experimental, and slightly heroic thing to do, and came down to the cheerful gathering crowd upon the sands again with the knowledge that it is a thing achieved for everyone.

An invalid lady of seventy could have enjoyed all that I did if only one could have got her into the passenger's seat. Getting there was a little difficult, it is true; the waterplane was out in the surf, and I was carried to it on a boatman's back, and then had to clamber carefully through the wires, but that is a matter of detail. This flying is indeed so certain to become a general experience that I am sure that this description will in a few years seem almost as quaint as if I had set myself to record the fears and sensations of my First Ride in a Wheeled Vehicle. And I suspect that learning to control a Farman waterplane now is probably not much more difficult than, let us say, twice the difficulty in learning the control and management of a motor-bicycle. I cannot understand the sort of young man who won't learn how to do it if he gets half a chance.|$|E
