5|$|The Indian Ocean Dipole is an atmospheric–oceanic {{phenomenon}} {{characterized by}} differences in <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures between {{the eastern and}} western sections of the tropical Indian Ocean. Similar to the Antarctic Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. In the positive phase, the eastern section of the tropical Indian Ocean is cooler (lower <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperature) and the western section is warmer than normal (higher <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperature). On the other hand, the negative phase is characterized by warmer <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures on the eastern section and cooler <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures on the western section of the tropical Indian Ocean. Studies {{have shown that the}} Indian Ocean Dipole is partly responsible for variations in precipitation in Argentina and South America in general. During a positive phase, precipitation is higher in the Río de la Plata Basin due to teleconnections.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{hypothesis}} {{put forth}} by Richard Lindzen is the iris hypothesis in which an increase in tropical <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures results in less cirrus clouds and thus more infrared radiation emitted to space.|$|E
5|$|Associations {{with various}} climate and {{environmental}} trends exist. For example, {{an increase in}} the <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperature of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season.|$|E
5|$|Factors {{required}} {{for the formation of}} medicanes are somewhat different than that normally expected of tropical cyclones; known to emerge over regions with <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures (SSTs) below , Mediterranean tropical cyclones often require incursions of colder air to induce atmospheric instability. A majority of medicanes develop above regions of the Mediterranean with SSTs of , with the upper bound only found in the southernmost reaches of the sea. Despite the low <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures, the instability incited by cold atmospheric air within a baroclinic zone—regions with high differences in temperature and pressure—permits the formation of medicanes, in contrast to tropical areas lacking high baroclinity, where raised SSTs are needed. While significant deviations in air temperature have been noted around the time of Mediterranean tropical cyclones' formation, few anomalies in <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperature coincide with their development, indicating that the formation of medicanes is primarily controlled by higher air temperatures, not by anomalous SSTs. Similar to tropical cyclones, minimal wind shear—difference in wind speed and direction over a region—as well as abundant moisture and vorticity encourages the genesis of tropical cyclone-like systems in the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

5|$|Most {{forecasting}} groups predicted {{above average}} activity {{in anticipation of}} a dissipating El Niño event {{and the development of a}} La Niña, as well as warmer than normal <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures. Overall, the forecasts were fairly accurate.|$|E
5|$|On March5, 2003, meteorologists {{from the}} University College London at the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium issued an {{extended}} range forecast for the typhoon season, noting {{the likelihood of}} near average tropical cyclone activity {{as a result of}} projected neutral <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures. The forecast indicated the potential for 26.2tropical storms, compared to the 10– and 30-year average of 27.8 and 26.3storms, respectively. The following month, the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to 26.7, indicating a slightly above average season. Over next two months, however, fluctuations in <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures, particularly those in the Central Pacific, caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June forecast. A rise in <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their forecasts to indicate a near-average season in their final August forecast update, which predicted 27tropical storms. The group was very accurate in their forecasts, with their April and August forecasts being the most accurate.|$|E
40|$|Estimating {{the area}} of <b>seabed</b> <b>surfaces</b> from {{pictures}} or videos is an important problem in seafloor surveys. This task is complex to achieve with moving platforms such as submersibles, towed or remotely operated vehicles (ROV), where the recording camera is typically not static and provides an oblique view of the seafloor. A new method for obtaining <b>seabed</b> <b>surface</b> area estimates is presented here, using the classical set up of two laser devices fixed to the ROV frame projecting two parallel lines over the seabed. By combining lengths measured directly from the image containing the laser lines, {{the area of}} <b>seabed</b> <b>surfaces</b> is estimated, {{as well as the}} camera’s distance to the seabed, pan and tilt angles. The only parameters required are the distance between the parallel laser lines and the camera’s horizontal and vertical angles of view. The method was validated with a controlled in situ experiment using a deep-sea ROV, yielding an area estimate error of 1. 5 %. Further applications and generalizations of the method are discussed, with emphasis on deep-sea applications...|$|R

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{continued to}} intensify, although the NHC anticipated strengthening to cease, because the hurricane {{was expected to}} move into areas of colder <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures. During this period, the winds of the system increased and Fausto became a Category 4 hurricane. Becoming a Category4 hurricane, Fausto attained its peak intensity, with winds of 145mph (230km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 936mbar (hPa; 27.64inHg). After attaining peak intensity, the NHC again noted {{that it was very}} likely that Fausto attained its peak intensity, as it was nearing a region of <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures less than 78°F (26°C).|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Linda was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} cyclone in September2015 that resulted in heavy rains across portions of Mexico and the Southwestern United States. The seventeenth named storm and eleventh hurricane of the season, Linda developed southwest of Mexico from a low pressure area on September5. Under warm <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures and low to moderate wind shear, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Linda by September6 and a hurricane by the next day. A well-defined eye soon formed within the storm's central dense overcast and Linda reached its peak intensity as a 125mph (205km/h) Category3 major hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale on September8. Thereafter, the storm moved into a stable environment and an area of lower <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures, causing rapid weakening. Convective activity dissipated and Linda degenerated into a remnant low on September10. The lingering system persisted southwest of Baja California, ultimately opening up into a trough on September14.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Maria was a Category 1 {{hurricane}} {{that made}} landfall {{on the island}} of Newfoundland during September 2011. Originating from a tropical wave over the central Atlantic on September 6, Maria moved toward the west and slowly strengthened. While approaching the northern Leeward Islands, however, the system entered a region of higher vertical wind shear and cooler <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures, causing it to degenerate into a low-pressure area. It slowly curved toward the north and northeast around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, and regained tropical storm status on September10. Maria further strengthened to attain hurricane status while making its closest approach to Bermuda. The cyclone attained peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) on September16, but weakened thereafter because of an increase in wind shear and cooler <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures. Maria made landfall on the southeastern coast of Newfoundland during the afternoon hours of September16 before becoming absorbed by a frontal system later on that same day.|$|E
5|$|In June, {{predictions}} from CSU and TSR {{were similar}} to pre-season forecasts due to the a lack of an El Niño and warmer-than-average <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures across the Atlantic Ocean. However, by July and August, CSU and TSR all adjusted their forecasts downward because of predictions of cooler-than-average <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures and above-average wind shear. NOAA also decreased the amount of activity in its final outlook, despite predicting a wetter-than-average western Africa and above-average <b>sea</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures in its report. On June3, CSU issued its first mid-season prediction {{for the remainder of}} the year. In its report, the organization continued to predict well above-average activity, with eighteen named storms, nine hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 165 units. CSU stated that there was a 72% chance of at least one major hurricane impacting any stretch of the United States coastline; the chances of a major hurricane hitting the East Coast and Gulf Coast were 48% and 47%, respectively. The following day, Tropical Storm Risk issued its third forecast for the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season, calling for sixteen named storms, eight hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE of 134 units; this activity was predicted to be roughly 30% above the 1950–2012 long-term mean. TSR gave a 65% probability that the landfalling ACE index would be above-average. A month later, TSR lowered its numbers to 15named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. On August2, Colorado State University issued another update for the season, lowering its numbers slightly. However, the organization continued to state that there was an above-average probability of a United States and Caribbean major hurricane landfall. Finally, on August8, NOAA issued its second and final outlook for the season, predicting 13 to 19 named storms, six to nine hurricanes, and three to five major hurricanes; these numbers were down slightly from its May outlook.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific, Category5 hurricanes usually occur only in El Niño years.
