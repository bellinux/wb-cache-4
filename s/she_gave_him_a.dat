5|$|Susan discovers her tutor, John Bradley, {{is behind}} the threats.

Susan supports Libby when she learns that Steph had sex with Dan, and is carrying his child. Susan is angry with Toadie when she discovers he helped Steph cover up the lie. When Paul is pushed off the Lassiter's Hotel mezzanine, Susan begins investigating who is responsible, and makes Diana Marshall (Jane Badler) her prime suspect.

25|$|Sikorsky's mother, Mariya Stefanovna Sikorskaya (née Temryuk-Cherkasova), was a {{physician}} who did not work professionally. She is sometimes called Zinaida Sikorsky. While homeschooling young Igor, <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> great love for art, especially in the life and work of Leonardo da Vinci, and the stories of Jules Verne. In 1900, at age 11, he accompanied his father to Germany and through conversations with his father, became interested in natural sciences. After returning home, Sikorsky began to experiment with model flying machines, and by age 12, {{he had made a}} small rubber band-powered helicopter.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Lynn realises {{she will}} have to perform surgery to save John, but Amanda is {{reluctant}} to get her the appropriate tools and allow her to perform it, so she is forced to improvise. During the improvised surgery, in which Lynn removes a piece of John's skull to relieve pressure on his brain, he hallucinates about another woman and declares his love out loud, distressing Amanda. She leaves, and flashbacks show her time with John, as well as her abduction of Adam, which left her guilt-ridden to the point <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> mercy killing out of guilt some time after his game. In the present, she reads a letter addressed to her which drives her to hysterics. As Lynn confesses to John that her ordeal has given her new appreciation of her family, Amanda returns with the news that Jeff has completed his tests, but refuses to remove Lynn's collar. She reveals that she no longer believes in John's philosophy, and has designed her traps simply to kill, including Troy's and Kerry's. She also fought with Eric Matthews after he escaped the bathroom by breaking his foot; she implies killing him, but John believes she left him to die.|$|E
500|$|Eventually Susan learns her tutor, John Bradley (Laurence Brewer), {{is behind}} the threats. Susan had trusted John, so she is shocked to find that he is her bully. Of Susan's discovery, Woodburne said [...] "It's so {{unexpected}} because it's somebody she believed to be of great integrity and someone who she thought was on her side". John, who {{is described as a}} [...] "seriously unhinged individual", kidnaps Susan when she confronts him. He holds her captive and becomes very angry. He confesses to Susan that he {{is behind the}} threats. He tells her that in 1995, when Susan was a teacher at Erinsborough High, <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> bad report and he failed his teaching course.

500|$|After {{the success}} of her urban {{crossover}} album Daydream, Carey began exerting {{more control over the}} creative aspects of her career. In doing so, she began pursuing a more hip-hop oriented sound, something very different from anything she had recorded previously. However, she was still writing ballads with Afanasieff, but began looking for more hip-hop/R producers to helm part of her new project. The song was recorded in February 1997. After Carey began working on the song with Q-Tip, they brought the lyrics, samples and melody over to Puff Daddy, who as a producer, had just earned his second number one single on the Hot 100 with [...] "Mo Money Mo Problems." [...] Due to rumors of Puffy's overbearing nature, Carey recorded her vocals separately, until <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> few demos to choose from. Puffy explained why Carey recorded her vocals separately, and his feelings regarding having worked with her: ...|$|E
500|$|By 20 January, he {{was close}} to death. His physicians, led by Lord Dawson of Penn, issued a {{bulletin}} with words that became famous: [...] "The King's life is moving peacefully towards its close." [...] Dawson's private diary, unearthed after his death and made public in 1986, reveals that the King's last words, a mumbled [...] "God damn you!", were addressed to his nurse, Catherine Black, when <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> sedative that night. Dawson, who supported the [...] "gentle growth of euthanasia", admitted in the diary that he hastened the King's death by injecting him, after 11.00 p.m., with two consecutive lethal injections: 3/4 gr. morphine followed by 1 gr. cocaine shortly afterwards. Dawson wrote that he acted to preserve the King's dignity, to prevent further strain on the family, and so that the King's death at 11:55p.m. could be announced in the morning edition of The Times newspaper rather than [...] "less appropriate... evening journals". Neither Queen Mary, who was intensely religious and might not have sanctioned euthanasia, nor the Prince of Wales was consulted. The royal family did not want the King to endure pain and suffering and did not want his life prolonged artificially but nor did they approve Dawson's actions. British Pathe announced the King's death the following day, in which he was described as [...] "more than a King, a father of a great family".|$|E
500|$|After {{his girlfriend}} Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) sues her former {{employer}} Dunder Mifflin for wrongful termination, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) finds himself forced by Jan to {{be a witness}} against his employer. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{wants to make sure}} Michael will not say anything to harm Dunder Mifflin even though Michael is Jan's boyfriend. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) comes along as the HR representative, against Michael's protests. The deposition goes well for Jan at first, as she claims that she was terminated due to discrimination over her breast augmentation. To counter evidence that she had a romantic relationship with Michael before they disclosed it to corporate, Jan submits Michael's personal diary, which she brought to the deposition without his knowledge or permission. Michael is further incensed against Jan when he learns that <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> scathing performance review after they had begun dating, claiming that he is unfit for his current position and should be demoted to sales. Michael learns he was never a contender when interviewing for Jan's former position at the corporate office, with the CFO insisting repeatedly that he is a nice guy, but ultimately unsuited for the position. Michael defends the company anyway, and later states that [...] "you expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend." [...] Jan and Michael drive home, clearly angry at each other over the events of the day.|$|E

2500|$|Because it {{was against}} the custom {{of the people of}} Daura for their queens to marry, Daurama made a {{compromise}} with Bayajidda and said she would only have sexual intercourse with him later; because of this, <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> concubine named Bagwariya. (according to the oral palace version of the legend, Daurama gave him Bagwariya because she wanted to break her [...] "queenly vow to remain a virgin," [...] but had to undergo rituals to do so.) ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} Van Zandt was checked {{out of the}} {{hospital}} early the next morning, he had begun to show signs of DTs. Jeanene rushed him to her car, where <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> flask of vodka to ward off the withdrawal delirium. She would later report that after getting back to his home in Smyrna, and giving him alcohol, he became [...] "lucid, in a real good mood, calling his friends on the phone." [...] Jim Calvin shared a marijuana joint with him, and he was also given about four Tylenol PM tablets.|$|E

2500|$|Pennington had excelled academically since {{elementary}} school, {{participating in}} the academic team since the fifth grade and winning the Eastern Kentucky regional science competition in the seventh grade. He attended Elliott County High School for grades nine to eleven, and taught himself calculus during his freshman year.

He also developed a grudge against his English teacher Mrs. McDavid after <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> [...] "C" [...] as his midterm grade. The midterm grade was for an essay Pennington had written about the Stephen King novel Rage; {{the content of the}} essay concerned McDavid, given that some of his other writing likewise focused on [...] "violence, death, and dying".

2500|$|Helen Mitchell was {{a militant}} Catholic, {{and the young}} José {{was raised in a}} strict authoritarian environment, where he read little of the popular literature, never went to the theater, {{attended}} mass daily and similarly read Imitação de Cristo daily in preparation of the [...] "ultimate sacrifice". [...] Similarly, his life was quite regimented: he went to sleep at 11 and woke at 6 in the morning, fenced for an hour, went to mass, had two hours training on horseback daily, and regularly shined his boots, brushed his suits and cleaned most of his personal items. Helena Mitchell instilled in her son a religious zeal and military regime; at the age of 11 <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> copy of the History of the Crusades, Ivanhoe and he read and re-read a copy of Don Quixote, while fostering ethos of the medieval knight: austerity, valor, abstinence, [...] service to God and to country.|$|E
2500|$|A month passed, and no {{decision}} was reached in London respecting Mary's future. On 13 July Knollys contrived to remove her, despite [...] "'her tragical demonstrations", to Bolton Castle, {{the seat of}} Lord Scrope, where he tried to amuse her by teaching her to write and speak English. Knollys's position grew more and more distasteful, and writing on 16 July to Cecil, whom he kept well informed of Mary's conversation and conduct, he angrily demanded his recall. But while lamenting his occupation, Knollys conscientiously endeavoured to convert his prisoner to his puritanic views, and she read the English prayer-book under his guidance. In his discussions with her he commended so unreservedly the doctrines and forms of Geneva that Elizabeth, on learning his line of argument, sent him a sharp reprimand. Knollys, writing to Cecil in self-defence, described how contentedly Mary accepted his plain speaking on religious topics. Mary made in fact every effort to maintain good relations with him. Late in August <b>she</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> present for his wife, desired his wife's acquaintance, and wrote to him a very friendly note, her first attempt in English composition.|$|E
