A change to larger QD sizes in smaller concentrations occurred after formation of a dislocation array. Cathodoluminescence(CL) spectra show a bimodal peak with lower energy peak enhancement when probing at lower e-beam energies. The two peaks separate {{as a result of}} QDinterdiffusion.

40|$|Conventional {{time domain}} Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) {{relies on the}} {{detection}} of an interference pattern generated by the interference of backscattered light from the sample and a reference Optical Delay Line (ODL). By referencing the sample interference with the scan depth of the ODL, constructive interference indicates depth in the sample of a reflecting structure. Conventional ODLs used in time domain OCT require some physical movement of a mirror to scan a given depth range. This movement results in instrument degradation. Also in some situations {{it is necessary to}} have no moving parts. Stationary ODLs (SODLs) include dual Reflective Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) systems (Type I) and single Transmissive SLM with match-arrayed-waveguide systems (Type II). In this paper, the method of fabrication and characterisation of a number of Stepped Mirrored Structures (SMS) is presented. These structures are intended for later use in proof-of-principle experiments that demonstrate Type II SODL: a six step, 2 mm step depth macro-SMS, an eight step 150 um deep micro-SMS with glue between steps, and a six step 150 um deep micro-SMS with no glue between steps. These SMS are characterized in terms of their fabrication, <b>step</b> <b>alignment</b> and step height increment precision. The degree of alignment of each step was verified using half of a bulk Michelson interferometer. Step height was gauged using a pair of vernier callipers measuring each individual step. A change in notch frequency using an in-fibre Mach-Zhender interferometer was used to gauge the average step height and the result compared to the vernier calliper results. The best aligned SMS was the micro-SMS prepared by method B with no glue between steps. It demonstrated a 95 % confidence interval variation of 1 % in reflected intensity, with the least variation in intensity within steps. This SMS also had the least absolute variation in step height increment: less than 8 um. Though less variation would be ideal, for producing micro-SMS for proof of principle experiments for Type II stationary ODL, of the method compared, method B, with no glue between steps, produced more reproducible step height increments and <b>step</b> <b>alignment...</b>|$|E

40|$|Using {{biometrics}} {{to verify}} a person’s identity has several advantages over the present practices of personal identification numbers (PINs) and passwords. At the same time, improvements in VLSI technology have recently {{led to the}} introduction of smart cards with 32 -bit RISC processors. To gain maximum security in verification systems using biometrics, verification as well as storage of the biometric pattern must be done in the smart card. However, because of the limited resources (processing power and memory space) of the smart card, integrating biometrics into it is still an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a fingerprint verification algorithm using a multi-resolution accumulator array that can be executed in restricted environments such as the smart card. We first evaluate both the number of instructions executed and the memory requirement for each step of a typical fingerprint verification algorithm. We then develop a memory-efficient algorithm for the most memory-consuming <b>step</b> (<b>alignment)</b> using a multi-resolution accumulator array. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the required memory space by a factor of 40 and can be executed in real time in resource-constrained environments without significantly degrading accuracy...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} a conversion function {{from a source}} speaker to a target speaker, voice conversion methods use training sets of both speakers. Most training algorithms require parallel data sets, that is, prerecorded sentences of the source and target speakers saying the same text. In such a setup, evaluation of a conversion function is based on coupled feature vectors—source and target. Alternatively, some methods have been proposed, suggesting training algorithms which avoid the need for pre-alignment altogether. A probabilistic approach presented by Nankaku et al. includes statistical modeling for optimizing the conversion function and the correspondence between source-target segments [11]. Another method which does not require time alignment as a pre-processing stage is the iterative combination of a nearest neighbour search step and a conversion <b>step</b> <b>alignment</b> method (INCA) [12]. This method uses iterative estimation of the alignment (using nearest neighbour search) and conversion estimation (classical GMM conversion). Recently, we proposed {{a modified version of}} this method called temporal-context INCA (TC-INCA), using context vectors instead of single spectral vectors, which lead to improved estimation of the alignment and to higher quality and similarity to the target speaker [13]. Although these methods were designed for a non-parallel setup, they {{can be used in a}} parallel setup, when aligned data is unavailable.|$|E
40|$|The Laser <b>Step</b> <b>Alignment</b> (LSA) is a through- the-lens, field-by-field {{alignment}} system {{developed for}} an optical step- and- repeat {{system with a}} reduction projection lens (wafer stepper) intended for one micron or submicron lithography. The laser beam used for LSA is focused on a wafer through the projection lens. The alignment marks on the wafer are {{in the shape of}} diffraction gratings. The mark detection is performed by moving the wafer stage so that the alignment mark travels across the laser beam. The passage of the align-ment mark produces diffracted and scattered light, which is photo- electrically detected as the alignment signal. The position of the alignment mark is accurately measured by the laser interferomter attached to the wafer stage. The LSA system achieves overlay accuracy (2 aa) less than 0. 15 um for processed wafers. LSA uses a 633 nm He-Ne laser, so the photoresist is not sensitive to it, and LSA is well applicable to multilayer resist processes. The alignment time is about 0 - 6 seconds per shot in field-by-field mode. This LSA is attached to the Nikon wafer stepper (NSR), so field-by- field alignment, several types of alignment, and other measurement for compensa-tion are performed. An appropriate alignment may be selected to meet the accuracy and throughput required in each case...|$|E

40|$|The {{gaps between}} two mating {{surfaces}} should be strictly controlled in precision manufacturing. Oversizing of gaps will decrease the dimensional accuracy and {{may reduce the}} fatigue life of a mechanical product. In {{order to reduce the}} gaps and keep them within tolerance, the relative posture (orientation and position) of two components should be optimized in the assembly process. This paper presents an optimal posture evaluation model to control the assembly gaps in aircraft wing assembly. Based on the <b>step</b> <b>alignment</b> strategy, i. e. preliminary alignment and refined alignment, the concept of a small posture transformation (SPT) is introduced. In the preliminary alignment, an initial posture is estimated by a set of auxiliary locating points (ALPs), with which the components can be quickly aligned near each other. In the refined alignment, the assembly gaps are calculated and the formulation of the gaps with component posture is derived by the SPT. A comprehensive weighted minimization model with gap tolerance constraints is established for redistributing the gaps in multi-regions. Powell-Hestenes-Rockafellar (PHR) optimization, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and KD-tree searching are introduced for the solution of the optimal posture for localization. Using the SPT, the trigonometric posture transformation is linearized, which benefits the iterative solution process. Through the constrained model, overall gaps are minimized and excess gaps are controlled within tolerance. Practical implications – This method has been tested with simulated model data and real product data, the results of which have shown efficient coordination of mating components. This paper proposed an optimal posture evaluation method for minimizing the gaps between mating surfaces through component adjustments. This will promote the assembly automation and variation control in aircraft wing assembly...|$|E
40|$|A large multi-aperture {{telescope}} has {{the potential}} to reach the diffraction limit corresponding to its baseline. To do so, Adaptive Optics (AO) and beam combination are critical to good performance. Operation as an interferometer is a complicated mode for the telescope. The system now has much tighter tolerances and is difficult to align. The alignment process needs to be planned in multiple steps, and tolerance and sensitivity analysis needs to be performed for each <b>step.</b> <b>Alignment</b> tools can be prepared based on the resolution found in the sensitivity analysis in each step. Random fluctuation is another critical factor that reduces system performance. If noise sources near the telescope are characterized and identified, image quality can be improved by post-image processing. Measuring the outer scale of atmosphere is also helpful for understanding the system performance. The fringe tracking method in the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) system provides optical path difference (OPD) variation, and the power spectral density of the OPD variation is used to estimate the size of the outer scale. However, this method is limited by the baseline of the LBTI by 5 √ 3 B, where B is the baseline, and by this equation the outer scale size which is able to be estimated should be more than 125 m. AO simulation can provide an understanding of new AO system concepts and parameter variations before they are applied to the real system. In this dissertation study, we simulated an LBTI system with structural vibration of 10 Hz and 20 Hz and with various amplitudes. From the simulation, we learned that the slower bandwidth of piston-correcting systems allows stars as faint as ~ 13 the magnitude to be observed. If there is significant vibration on the structure, the increased bandwidth will limit the phasing stars to 10 ~ 11 th magnitudes. This demonstrates the limits of the LBTI system regarding structural vibration. An alternative phasing sensor for the LBTI system, the pseudo phasing sensor, can be used for more than 1000 m of outer scale of atmosphere. If the direct phasing sensor embedded in the LBTI system cannot be used for a very faint star, the pseudo phasing sensor, which approximately estimates the phase difference by AO wavefront sensor, can be useful for atmospheric conditions with estimated outer scale of about 1000 m. The analyses in this dissertation provide a partial guide for developing large-scale telescopes and astronomical instruments...|$|E

This thesis describes the first MEMS process designed to provide multi-user functionality using polymers as structural and sacrificial layers, and offers new fabrication abilities not previously available with silicon micromachining. The structural material for this MEMS process is the negative tone photoresist SU- 8, which is excellent for low temperature permanent applications. This work has developed a very reliable method of producing compliant SU- 8 microstructures and has characterized it for {{a new class of}} structures and actuators. The use of SU- 8 offers many advantages with respect to processing, but also introduces many processing challenges that were solved in this work. The polymer MEMS process developed for this work has a multi-thickness structural layer separated from the substrate by a single sacrificial layer. The sacrificial layer includes dimple features to reduce stiction and allow structures in excess of 5000 X 5000 µm 2 to release without problems.

40|$|Motivation: The {{combination}} of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS) {{has been widely}} used for large-scale comparative studies in systems biology, including proteomics, glycomics and metabolomics. In almost all experimental design, {{it is necessary to}} compare chromatograms across biological or technical replicates and across sample groups. Central to this is the peak <b>alignment</b> <b>step,</b> {{which is one of the}} most important but challenging preprocessing <b>steps.</b> Existing <b>alignment</b> tools do not take into account the structural dependencies between related peaks that co-elute and are derived from the same metabolite or peptide. We propose a direct matching peak alignment method for LC/MS data that incorporates related peaks information (within each LC/MS run) and investigate its effect on alignment performance (across runs). The groupings of related peaks necessary for our method can be obtained from any peak clustering method and are built into a pairwise peak similarity score function. The similarity score matrix produced is used by an approximation algorithm for the weighted matching problem to produce the actual alignment result. Results: We demonstrate that related peak information can improve alignment performance. The performance is evaluated on a set of benchmark datasets, where our method performs competitively compared to other popular alignment tools.
