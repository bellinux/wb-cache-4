5|$|There was initial {{confusion}} as to {{how this}} game would be distributed to consumers, after the announcement {{that it would be}} a multiplayer-only title. Sony announced on May 16, 2007, that there would be two iterations of the game. The game alone is downloadable from the PlayStation Store for US$29.99 (£19.99, €29.99), with an initial download size of 798MB. This version is restricted to the PlayStation Network account that buys it. The second is a retail Blu-ray Disc version that <b>sells</b> <b>for</b> $59.99 (the standard retail price of most PlayStation 3 games upon release), bundled with a Jabra BT125 Bluetooth headset in America and the Jabra BT135 in Europe, allowing players to chat with other players online while playing the game. An additional third was later released on October 10, 2007 without the inclusion of a USB headset, which was priced at US$39.99. Both retail versions feature extra content such as behind-the-scenes developer interviews, concept art and trailers. Warhawk was re-released as a Greatest Hits title on July 28, 2008 for $29.99.|$|E
25|$|The {{agriculture}} objectives on {{the desert}} lands are often questioned; the desert farm lands which were offered regularly at different levels and prices were restricted to a limited group of elites selected very carefully, who later profiteered retailing the granted large desert farm land by pieces. This allegedly transforms the desert farms to tourist resorts, hits all government plans to develop and improve {{the conditions of the}} poor, and causes serious negative impact on agriculture and the overall national economy over time. One company, for example, bought over 70 hectare of large desert farm for a price as low as EGP 0.05 per square meter and now <b>sells</b> <b>for</b> EGP 300 per square meter. In numbers, 70 hectares bought for about US$6,000 in 2000 <b>sells</b> <b>for</b> over US$3.7 million in 2007. Currently, no clear solution exists to deal with these activities.|$|E

Popular manufacturers include Nagasawa, 3Rensho, Makino, Kalavinka, Level, Bridgestone, Panasonic, Samson, Shimano, Nitto, Hatta, MKS, Kashimax, and Sugino. Because the NJS's main objective is supporting the Japanese cycling market, its bureaucracy is notoriously critical of foreign manufacturers attempting to enter the Japanese market. The Italian cycling equipment manufacturer Campagnolo has, though, received NJS certification.|$|E
25|$|The {{assessment}} of Custer's actions during the American Indian Wars has undergone substantial reconsideration in modern times. Documenting {{the arc of}} popular perception in his biography Son of the Morning Star (1984), author Evan Connell notes the reverential tone of Custer's first biographer Frederick Whittaker (whose book was rushed out the year of Custer's death.) Connell concludes:These days it is stylish to denigrate the general, whose stock <b>sells</b> <b>for</b> nothing. Nineteenth-century Americans thought differently. At that {{time he was a}} cavalier without fear and beyond reproach.|$|E

For example, properties in the catchment area of Frankston High School, {{which is one of}} the most reputable state government schools in Victoria, sell on average for 16.9% more than the median house price. The locality of Olivers Hill, with its panoramic views across Port Philip, is home to the most expensive {{real estate in}} Frankston. Property in the area has sold for between A$3 and A$4million in 2015, at the same time as the median house price in the suburb of Frankston being A$390,000. Olivers Hill is considered to have one of the top ten residential views in Melbourne.|$|E

An original 1966 model with the push-pin hole in the receiver can <b>sell</b> <b>for</b> around $9,000.

25|$|Occupy Nigeria is an anti-fuel subsidy removal {{protest that}} started in Nigeria on 2 January 2012 in {{response}} to fuel subsidy removal by the Federal government of Nigeria on 1 January 2012. It is a movement against corruption in Government & public service, insensitive & inhuman treatment of Nigerians by Government & Security agents. The movement ended on 16 January 2012 following agreement {{between the government and}} the organized labour leaders which saw a partial restoration of the subsidy regime. Fuel pump price in Nigeria has since then been fixed at the official rate of 97 naira per litre while it practically <b>sells</b> <b>for</b> as high as 130 naira in some major cities including Port Harcourt, one of the cities in the oil-producing states in Nigeria.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, copper-containing {{tourmaline}} {{was found in}} Nigeria. The material was generally paler and less saturated than the Brazilian materials, although the material generally was much less included. A more recent African discovery from Mozambique has also produced tourmaline colored by copper, similar to the Brazilian paraiba. While its colors are somewhat less bright than top Brazilian material, Mozambique paraiba is often less included and {{has been found in}} larger sizes. The Mozambique paraiba material usually is more intensely colored than the Nigerian. There is a significant overlap in color and clarity with Mozambique paraiba and Brazilian paraiba, especially with the material from Rio Grande do Norte. While less expensive than top quality Brazilian paraiba, some Mozambique material <b>sells</b> <b>for</b> well over $5,000 per carat, which still is extremely high compared to other tourmalines.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to rural}} parts of California, living in Milpitas is more expensive, {{as it is}} {{throughout}} Silicon Valley. Compared to other South Bay bedroom communities Milpitas is considered affordable. For example, a regular one-story, detached single-family home with a 1,300-square-foot (140 m²) size <b>sells</b> <b>for</b> between $600,000 to $700,000 in the city. These prices are slightly more affordable {{than the rest of}} the San Francisco Bay Area, as a similar sized house may cost well over a million dollars in more affluent cities such as Palo Alto, Cupertino or Saratoga. Reasons for the expensive housing in the South Bay Area include the regional high tech industries, mild climate, strong foreign investment in the West Coast's housing, and a huge demand for limited homes. With the decline in the housing market, however, median sales prices in Milpitas have declined from nearly $700,000 to less than $500,000, and single-family new house construction building permits have plummeted from a 2004 average price of $949,900 to $269,400 in 2007.|$|E

25|$|Shark finning is a {{worldwide}} issue that involves {{cutting off the}} fins of sharks. This is done while the shark is still alive followed {{by the rest of}} the body being thrown back into the ocean, leaving it to die days after. Used in countries like China and Japan, shark fins are a key ingredient in the world-renowned meal, shark fin soup. The high demand for this particular type of soup has skyrocketed in the last few decades and <b>sells</b> <b>for</b> around $100 on average and is often catered at special occasions such as weddings and banquets. Due to the increased want for these shark fins, traders seek out the fins in order to make a profit. However, the fins are the only part of the shark that fishermen seek out to retrieve due to the low economical value of the actual shark meet. This recently exposed issue along with other overfishing issues has brought upon roughly 80 percent of the shark population decline. It has become prominent concern in marine conservation activism for millions of sharks are killed yearly at an often-unregulated expense.|$|E
25|$|The Proton Prevé has {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics in Australia. Daniel DeGasperi from CarAdvice gave the Prevé GX 2 out 5 stars. The five-year warranty, free servicing and roadside assistance {{as well as}} the roomy interior, steering and handling were well-received and complemented the Prevé's five-star ANCAP rating. However, the car was met with severe criticism in terms of its expensive pricing, poor performance and fuel economy, lackluster build quality and refinement, uncomfortable urban ride quality and detail design flaws. Daniel commented “The Proton Preve should be priced at least $4,000 cheaper, to be reasonably competitive against light sedans such as the Holden Barina and Nissan Almera. It is better than the Chery J3 that <b>sells</b> <b>for</b> $6000 less, but the Proton isn’t necessarily 35 per cent better, and it certainly shares some of the Chinese-made hatchback’s quality and refinement shortfalls.” Proton Cars Australia however responded swiftly and positively, and the Prevé GX received a major $3,000 price cut on 1 August 2013, 2 months after the review was published. The 5-speed manual and 6-speed CVT variants are currently priced at $15,990 and $17,990 driveaway, down from $18,990 and $20,990 respectively. Both variants are still offered with 5 years warranty and 5 years roadside assist, but 5 years free servicing is no longer offered and has been replaced with a 5-year capped-price servicing scheme. Nonetheless, Proton Cars Australia bills the Prevé as “Australia's most affordable small car” with all things considered.|$|E
