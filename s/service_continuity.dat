Since 2005 the Conservatives have endeavoured {{to distance themselves from}} both their predecessors and to set out a new vision for education. This paper, which focuses on primary and secondary education, discusses and compares discourse and policy, and argues that the expected renewal has been superseded by a re-enactment of 1980 s policies and a revival of Thatcher’s ideas and values. It identifies several economic and political factors accounting for the recent ’Thatcherite turn’ in education, which should also be considered in the wider historical context of the protracted development of state education in England in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Here, “New Conservatives” will refer to the Conservative-led Coalition Government...|$|R

In this work we propose a handoff scheme which takes handoff decision adaptively based on the type of network it presently resides and the one it is attempting handoff with through some predefined rules. It also relies on the speed of the mobile terminal to make a decision of the handoff initiation received signal strength (RSS) threshold value. Finally simulations have been done to show the importance of taking these factors into account for handoff decisions rather than having a fixed threshold value of handoff for different scenarios...|$|R

40|$|A {{framework}} {{that aims to}} best utilize the mobile network resources for video applications is presented in this paper. The main contribution of the work proposed is the QoE-driven optimization method that can maintain a desired trade-off between fairness and efficiency in allocating resources in terms of data rates to video streaming users in LTE networks. This method {{is concerned with the}} control of the user satisfaction level from the <b>service</b> <b>continuity’s</b> point of view and applies appropriate QoE metrics (Pause Intensity and variations) to determine the scheduling strategies in combination with the mechanisms used for adaptive video streaming such as 3 GP/MPEG-DASH. The superiority of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated, showing how the resources of a mobile network can be optimally utilized by using quantifiable QoE measurements. This approach can also find the best match between demand and supply in the process of network resource distribution...|$|R

We focus on problems the infectious disease clinician may encounter and provide a frame-work for evaluating returned medical tourists with suspected infections.
