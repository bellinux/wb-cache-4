5000|$|Movax <b>sheet</b> <b>piler</b> {{is a high}} {{frequency}} hydraulic vibrator, typically mounted to a large excavator (or co-powered with a separate powerpack) and {{takes advantage of the}} excavator's own hydraulics for additional down force, up to 80 tons, depending on the equipment. With this power, Movax <b>sheet</b> <b>piler</b> can be used to drive sheet piles, I-beams, and pipes in virtually any type of soil condition. Although classed as a {{high frequency}} vibrator, it is neither [...] "resonant free" [...] or [...] "variable moment" [...] and so there is little control over the vibrations produced.|$|E
5000|$|Movax <b>sheet</b> <b>piler</b> is {{controlled}} by a cab-mounted automatic steering system;current model Auto C which allows the operator to select a precise angle to drive/extract piles, even horizontally. A skilled operator can pick up, position and drive a pile in one fluid motion. With computer-assisted automatic steering system and side grip ability, Movax sheet piler/excavator combination automatically corrects the straightness of the sheet pile during the driving and extracting. When Movax <b>sheet</b> <b>piler</b> drives the first pile into the ground, the distance is put into memory. Auto B takes the pile to the right distance near the guide and sets pile into the upright position, reducing the typical [...] "walking" [...] of the pile wall typical with other methods of installation.The other Movax roducst are; Soil Drills and Impact hammers.Movax products are manufactured by Movax Ltd Finland.
