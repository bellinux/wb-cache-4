30|$|Here, for <b>single</b> <b>ears</b> {{two types}} of close-range {{suppression}} were simulated, a total suppression beyond a simple low-side limit (Sim 1), and a progressive suppression over a low-side range (Sim 2). The two simulations have shown that both types of suppression lead to a strong distribution peak slightly above the limitation (Figure[*] 1). The group simulation of 1000 ears showed that a linear increase of suppression probability with decreasing inter-emitter distance almost perfectly mirrored the real data (Figure[*] 3). All simulations taken together indicate that stochastic spacing of emitters plus close-rang suppression alone can explain the PMD phenomenon.|$|R
60|$|On deck, for'ard, a dozen blacks pottered clumsily at {{scraping}} the teak rail. They were as inexpert at {{their work as}} so many monkeys. In fact they looked very much like monkeys of some enlarged and prehistoric type. Their eyes had in them the querulous plaintiveness of the monkey, their faces were even less symmetrical than the monkey's, and, hairless of body, they were far more ungarmented than any monkey, for clothes they had none. Decorated they were as no monkey ever was. In holes in their ears they carried short clay pipes, rings of turtle shell, huge plugs of wood, rusty wire nails, and empty rifle cartridges. The calibre of a Winchester rifle was the smallest hole an ear bore; {{some of the largest}} holes were inches in diameter, and any <b>single</b> <b>ear</b> averaged from three to half a dozen holes. Spikes and bodkins of polished bone or petrified shell were thrust through their noses. On the chest of one hung a white doorknob, on the chest of another the handle of a china cup, on the chest of a third the brass cogwheel of an alarm clock. They chattered in queer, falsetto voices, and, combined, did no more work than a single white sailor.|$|E
60|$|Heer {{gives an}} {{interesting}} {{account of the}} first appearance and final disappearance of the several plants which were cultivated in greater or less abundance in Switzerland during former successive periods, and which generally differed more or less from our existing varieties. The peculiar small-eared and small-grained wheat, already alluded to, was the commonest kind during the Stone period; it lasted down to the Helvetico-Roman age, and then became extinct. A second kind was rare at first, but afterwards became more frequent. A third, the Egyptian wheat (T. turgidum), does not agree exactly with any existing variety, and was rare during the Stone period. A fourth kind (T. dicoccum) differs from all known varieties of this form. A fifth kind (T. monococcum) {{is known to have}} existed during the Stone period only by the presence of a <b>single</b> <b>ear.</b> A sixth kind, the common T. spelta, was not introduced into Switzerland until the Bronze age. Of barley, besides the short-eared and small-grained kind, two others were cultivated, one of which was very scarce, and resembled our present common H. distichum. During the Bronze age rye and oats were introduced; the oat- grains being somewhat smaller than those produced by our existing varieties. The poppy was largely cultivated during the Stone period, probably for its oil; but the variety which then existed is not now known. A peculiar pea with small seeds lasted from the Stone to the Bronze age, and then became extinct; whilst a peculiar bean, likewise having small seeds, came in at the Bronze period and lasted to the time of the Romans. These details sound like the descriptions given by palaeontologists of the first appearance, the increasing rarity, and final extinction or modification of fossil species, embedded in the successive stages of a geological formation.|$|E

40|$|Different time-frequency {{techniques}} {{may be used}} {{to investigate}} the relation between latency and frequency of transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions. In this work, the optimization of these techniques and the interpretation of the experimental result are discussed. Time-frequency analysis of click-evoked otoacoustic emissions of 42 normal-hearing young subjects has been performed, using both wavelet and matching pursuit algorithms. Wavelet techniques are very effective to provide fast and reliable evaluation of the average latency of large samples of subjects. A major advantage of the matching pursuit technique, as observed by Jedrzejczak et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 115, 2148 - 2158 (2004) ], is to provide detailed information about the time evolution of the response of <b>single</b> <b>ears</b> at selected frequencies. A hybrid matching pursuit algorithm that includes Fourier spectral information was developed, capable of speeding-up computation times and of identifying "spurious" atoms, whose latency-frequency relation is apparently anomalous. These atoms could be associated with several known phenomena, either intrinsic, such as intermodulation distortion, spontaneous emissions and multiple internal reflections, or extrinsic, such as instrumental noise, linear ringing and the acquisition window onset. A correct interpretation of these phenomena is important to get accurate estimates of the otoacoustic emission latency. (c) 2007 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R

E. fasciata is generally diurnal, however males fly at night to find pheromone plumes emitted by sexually active females. The odor receptors used for this are located on the long feathered antennae.

50|$|Elaphe {{have very}} {{developed}} sensory organs which support their daily activities. They have an internal ear that {{enables them to}} detect sounds at low frequencies. The ear consists of a <b>single</b> <b>ear</b> bone connected to a jaw bone. Compared to other snakes, Elaphe are considered to have highly developed vision that allows them to detect the movement of their predators and prey. The eyes are protected by single transparent brilles. In addition, the analysis of scents is carried out by Jacobson's organ in the palate. To stimulate Jacobson's organ, Elaphe use their tongues to transport air and ground molecules such that the molecules come into contact with Jacobson's organ. Then the organ analyzes the molecules to identify the scent. Among these detectable scents are pheromones, which indicate the presence of other snakes and their reproductive readiness.|$|E

MethodsA total of 122 dogs were examined by otoscopy, and auricular swab samples were collected from both ears in 74 dogs presenting clinical bilateral otitis and from <b>single</b> <b>ears</b> in 48 dogs displaying clinical unilateral otitis. Cytological examination, bacteriological analysis and antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed. ResultsThirty-one out of 122 dogs were positive for yeast species (25. 4 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 18. 2 %– 34. 2 %) with a higher prevalence of Malassezia pachydermatis (21 / 31 isolates, 67. 7 %, CI: 48. 5 %– 82. 7 %), {{and a total of}} 91 out of 122 dogs were positive for bacterial species (74. 6 %; CI: 65. 8 %– 81. 8 %) with a higher prevalence of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (45 / 143 isolates, 31. 5 %, CI: 24. 1 %– 39. 8 %). These results are the first description of Streptococcus agalactiae-associated otitis. The yeasts isolated showed high levels of susceptibility to all antifungal agents tested; on the contrary all the isolated bacterial strains were highly resistant to at least four out of ten antimicrobial classes. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria showed high resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate and kanamycin hence they are not recommended as initial empirical therapy for the otitis treatment. ConclusionsThis update illustrates an increase in antibiotic resistances providing an insight into the current {{knowledge of the}} therapeutic procedures followed on canine otitis externa in Italy. It also emphasizes the importance of considering the results of the microbiological and sensitivity tests to decide on an appropriate antibiotic therapy...|$|R
