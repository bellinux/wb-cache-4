This <b>subgroup</b> of comets is known as <b>Subgroup</b> II.

The notion of equivalence of fuzzy <b>subgroups</b> which is used in this thesis was first introduced by Murali and Makamba. We use this equivalence to charterise fuzzy <b>subgroups</b> of inite Abelian groups (p-groups in particular) for a specified prime p. We characterize some crisp <b>subgroups</b> of p-groups and investigate some cases on equi valent fuzzy <b>subgroups...</b>|$|R

Genetic markers from individuals are examined to find a population's genetic structure.

In particular, a proof was given that pure <b>subgroups</b> of finite exponent are direct summands. A more complete discussion of pure <b>subgroups,</b> their relation to infinite abelian group theory, and a survey of their literature is given in Irving Kaplansky's little red book.|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of {{strongly}} quasiconvex <b>subgroups</b> of an arbitrary finitely generated group. Strong quasiconvexity generalizes quasiconvexity in hyperbolic groups and is preserved under quasi-isometry. Strongly quasiconvex <b>subgroups</b> are more reflexive than stable <b>subgroups</b> defined by Durham-Taylor, and they also capture the geometry of ambient groups. We prove that strongly quasiconvex <b>subgroups</b> have many properties analogous to those of quasiconvex <b>subgroups</b> of hyperbolic groups. We show a strong connection between strong quasiconvexity and lower relative divergence, and we suggest a classification of strongly quasiconvex <b>subgroups</b> by using lower relative divergence. We give complete descriptions of strong quasiconvexity and stability in relatively hyperbolic groups. Additionally, we characterize strongly quasiconvex special <b>subgroups</b> and stable special <b>subgroups</b> of two dimensional right-angled Coxeter groups, and we use these results to study Morse boundary of right-angled Coxeter groups. We prove that two notions of strong quasiconvexity and stability are equivalent in a right-angled Artin group A_Γ (except for the case of finite index <b>subgroups)</b> and we also characterize non-trivial strongly quasiconvex <b>subgroups</b> of infinite index in A_Γ (i. e. non-trivial stable <b>subgroups</b> in A_Γ) by quadratic lower relative divergence. These results strengthen the work of Koberda-Mangahas-Taylor on characterizing purely loxodromic <b>subgroups</b> of right-angled Artin groups. Comment: 53 pages.

5|$|The Sun-grazing comets {{observed}} in 1843 (Great Comet of 1843) and 1963 (Comet Pereyra) {{seem to be}} closely related and belong to the <b>subgroup</b> I, although when their orbits are traced back to one previous perihelion, {{the differences between the}} orbital elements are still rather large, probably implying that they broke apart from each other one revolution before that.

In contrast, the twisted <b>subgroups</b> resulting from the (non-involutory) decomposition of groups into twisted <b>subgroups</b> and <b>subgroups</b> that we present in this article need not be gyrocommutative.
