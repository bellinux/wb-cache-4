5|$|These {{facts are}} {{obscured}} by the omission of the solvent from the expression that is normally used to define pKa, but pKa values obtained in a given mixed solvent {{can be compared to}} each other, giving relative acid strengths.

5|$|The density {{measured}} by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300kg/m³, {{is less than}} half that of a typical carbonaceous chondrite; this may indicate that the asteroid is very loosely packed rubble pile. The <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the interior volume of Mathilde consists of open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp may indicate that the asteroid does have some structural strength, so it could contain some large internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.|$|E
5|$|The lightest {{isotopes}} were synthesized {{by direct}} fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products. The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is 262Rf; heavier isotopes {{have only been}} observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers, of which only 267Rf has been confirmed. The heavy isotopes 266Rf and 268Rf have also been observed as electron capture daughters of the dubnium isotopes 266Db and 268Db, but have short half-lives to spontaneous fission: {{it seems likely that}} the <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> 270Rf, a likely daughter of 270Db. While the isotope 264Rf has yet to be observed, it is predicted to have a short half-life of 5s.|$|E

5|$|The King Island emu and the {{mainland}} emu show few morphological differences {{other than their}} significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of {{the mainland}} emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the culmen, whereas it was four times longer in the mainland emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the cranium. However, the distal foramen is known to be variable in the mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the contour of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus.|$|E

25|$|Other playwrights in {{this period}} also {{published}} their plays in quarto editions. Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus, for example, was published as a quarto in 1604 (Q1), with a second quarto edition in 1609.

25|$|There {{are three}} forms of {{analgesia}} {{suitable for the}} treatment of pain in babies: paracetamol (acetaminophen), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and the opioids. Paracetamol is safe and effective if given in the correct dosage. The <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (aspirin is seldom used). Of the opioids, morphine and fentanyl are most often used in a hospital setting, while codeine is effective for use at home.|$|E
25|$|Although {{many people}} {{associate}} heavy water primarily with {{its use in}} nuclear reactors, pure heavy water is not radioactive. Commercial-grade heavy water is slightly radioactive due {{to the presence of}} minute traces of natural tritium, but the <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> ordinary water. Heavy water that {{has been used as a}} coolant in nuclear power plants contains substantially more tritium as a result of neutron bombardment of the deuterium in the heavy water (tritium is a health risk when ingested in large quantities).|$|E

25|$|When Sandoz {{returns to}} Earth, {{his friends are}} dead, and his faith, once {{considered}} worthy of actual canonization by his superiors, is merely an extension of his bitter anger with the God who sent him to Rakhat. Due to relativistic space-time effects, decades had passed while he has been gone, during which popular outrage at the UN's initial and highly out-of-context report on the mission, and especially Sandoz's role in the tragedy, had left the Society of Jesus shattered and nearly extinct. As Sandoz painfully explains what really happened, his personal healing begins, but only time will prove whether the <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the Society of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|The butler’s mosaic {{dating from}} the middle of the 3rd century CE {{features}} a drinking scene. Two characters are serving two others, who are much smaller, from amphoras on their shoulders. The two amphoras bear the letters PIE (“Drink!” in Ancient Greek) and ZHCHC (“You will live” in Ancient Greek). The amphora bearers are flanked by another two characters, one of whom is carrying another amphora, the other of whom is carrying a branch of laurel and a basket of roses. This depiction is a greeting to all guests and a promise of hospitality. The <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> another mosaic held at the museum which bears the phrase Omnia tibi felicia (May everything please you).|$|E
25|$|In Iberia, {{settlements}} {{of known}} and attested populations of Bnei Anusim include those in Belmonte, in Portugal, and the Xuetes of Palma de Mallorca, in Spain. In 2011 Rabbi Nissim Karelitz, a leading rabbi and Halachic authority {{and chairman of}} the Beit Din Tzedek rabbinical court in Bnei Brak, Israel, recognized the entire Xuete community of Bnei Anusim in Palma de Mallorca, as Jews That population alone represented approximately 18,000 people, or just over 2% of the entire population of the island. The proclamation of the Jews' default acceptance of Catholicism by the Portuguese king actually resulted in a high percentage being assimilated in the Portuguese population. Besides the Xuetas, the <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> Spain.|$|E

50|$|Coincidentally, the two second-round groups both {{produced}} matches that were, in effect, semi-finals.

50|$|In 1929, Presburger {{proved that}} Peano {{arithmetic}} without multiplication was consistent, complete, and decidable. The following year, Skolem {{proved that the}} <b>same</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> Peano arithmetic without addition, a system named Skolem arithmetic in his honor. Gödel's famous 1931 result is that Peano arithmetic itself (with both addition and multiplication) is incompletable and hence a posteriori undecidable.|$|R
25|$|This {{explanation}} of Ubay {{also makes it}} very clear that the Companions did not differ at all about what was part of the Quran and what {{was not part of the}} Quran when the revelation had ceased. It is also important to note that the hadith appeared in the mushaf of Ubay because it was for his own personal use, in other words, his private notebook, where he did not always distinguish between Quranic material and hadith, since it was not meant for general use and he himself knew well what to make of his own notes. The <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the other copies of the Quran, which some of the Companions had for their own personal use.|$|E
25|$|In their book, The Fourth Turning, however, Strauss and Howe {{say that}} the precise {{boundaries}} of generations and turnings are erratic. The generational rhythm is not like certain simple, inorganic cycles in physics or astronomy, where time and periodicity can be predicted to the second. Instead, it resembles the complex, organic cycles of biology, where basic intervals endure but precise timing is difficult to predict. Strauss and Howe compare the saecular rhythm to the four seasons, which they say similarly occur in the same order, but with slightly varying timing. Just as winter may come sooner or later, and {{be more or less}} severe in any given year, the <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> a Fourth Turning in any given saeculum.|$|E
25|$|In Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, busses on most city routes have {{externally}} mounted carriers for bicycles, and {{bikes are}} {{allowed on the}} light rail trains {{at no extra cost}} outside of rush hour.

The <b>same</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> Grand River Transit buses in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Trains allow bikes with some restrictions. Where such services are not available, some cyclists get around this restriction by removing their pedals and loosening their handlebars as to fit into a box or by using folding bikes that can be brought onto the train or bus like a piece of luggage.
