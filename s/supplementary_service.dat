5|$|In May 1840 {{the coastal}} paddle steamer Unicorn made the company's first voyage to Halifax {{to begin the}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>service</b> to Montreal. Two months later {{the first of the}} four ocean-going steamers of the Britannia Class, {{departed}} Liverpool. By coincidence, the steamer’s departure had patriotic significance {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic: she was named the Britannia, and sailed on 4 July. Even on her maiden voyage, however, her performance indicated that the new era she heralded would be much more beneficial for Britain than the US. At a time when the typical packet ship might take several weeks to cross the Atlantic, the Britannia reached Halifax in 12 days and 10 hours, averaging 8.5 knots (15.7km/h), before proceeding to Boston. Such relatively brisk crossings quickly became the norm for the Cunard Line: during 1840–41, mean Liverpool–Halifax times for the quartet were 13 days 6 hours to Halifax and 11 days 4 hours homeward. Two larger ships were quickly ordered, one to replace the Columbia, which sank at Seal Island, Nova Scotia, in 1843 without loss of life. By 1845, steamship lines led by Cunard carried more saloon passengers than the sailing packets. Three years later, the British Government increased the annual subsidy to £156,000 so that Cunard could double its frequency. Four additional wooden paddlers were ordered and alternate sailings were direct to New York instead of the Halifax–Boston route. The sailing packet lines were now reduced to the immigrant trade.|$|E

25|$|Using its Section 38A licence, MTN-9 {{was able}} to begin their <b>supplementary</b> <b>service</b> in 1997 using the callsign AMN-31. The new station carried almost all of sister Prime7 station CBN-8's Prime {{programming}} {{with the exception of}} local news and major sporting events broadcast by Network Ten. This was allocated on 1996-07-18, and went to air in 1997, after being initially rejected by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. It is a feed of the Central West NSW version of Prime Television, and is licensed as AMN, broadcasting on UHF 31. A second licence for remote Western Australia, one of the last remaining solus markets, was put up for auction in 1998. WIN Television won the ability to broadcast to the entire regional Western Australia market (as opposed to GWN, which held separate licences in various areas), and subsequently launched its new station WOW in 1999. In the same year, WIN purchased Griffith affiliate MTN-9, as well as SES-8 Mount Gambier and RTS-5a Riverland.|$|E
500|$|PAL Express, a {{subsidiary}} of Philippine Airlines, once considered a direct route from Iloilo to Malay to boost Boracay-bound tourism traffic. [...] A resolution passed by the Iloilo City Local Development Council (ICLDC) called on PAL president Jaime Bautista to institute direct flights to Malay from Iloilo, with onward service to Cebu City on the return portion from Malay. [...] However, PAL has questioned the route's feasibility, citing congestion at Godofredo P. Ramos Airport which serves that municipality. [...] Nearly ten years after initial service was discussed, on March 20, 2017 leisure carrier Air Juan became the first airline to launch scheduled service between the two airports, as well as launching additional service to Cuyo in Palawan, and <b>supplementary</b> <b>service</b> to Sipalay in Negros Occidental.|$|E
500|$|Over Great Western's protests, in May 1839 Parry {{accepted}} Cunard's tender of £55,000 for a three-ship Liverpool–Halifax {{service with}} an extension to Boston and a <b>supplementary</b> <b>service</b> to Montreal. The annual subsidy was later raised £81,000 {{to add a}} fourth ship and departures from Liverpool were to be monthly during the winter and fortnightly {{for the rest of}} the year. Parliament investigated Great Western's complaints, and upheld the Admiralty's decision. Napier and Cunard recruited other investors including businessmen James Donaldson, Sir George Burns, and David MacIver. In May 1840, just before the first ship was ready, they formed the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company with initial capital of £270,000, later increased to £300,000 (£ in [...] ). [...] Cunard supplied £55,000. Burns supervised ship construction, McIver was responsible for day-to-day operations, and Cunard was the [...] "first among equals" [...] in the management structure. When MacIver died in 1845, his younger brother Charles assumed his responsibilities for the next 35 years. (For more detail of the first investors in the Cunard Line and also the early life of Charles Maciver, see Liverpool Nautical Research Society's Second Merseyside Maritime History, pp.33–37 1991.) ...|$|E
