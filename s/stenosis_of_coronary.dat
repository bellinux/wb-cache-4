30|$|Although {{haplotype}} blocks {{are referred}} as variant distributions in several loci but we defined the haplotypes {{based on the}} distribution of polymorphisms within transcription factor elements located separately on the MGP promoter. In previous study, we predicted the high minimal allele frequency (MAF) polymorphic scores for each transcription factor element and showed that the rs 1800801, rs 1800802 and rs 1800799 haplotypes within the MGP promoter did not relate to <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> arteries. Moreover, serum MGP concentration was not associated to the genotype and haplotype distributions (Najafi et al. 2014).

40|$|The report {{describes}} a 64 -year-old man with frequent early morning precordial pain. In December 1980, {{he began to}} have episodes of dull pain in the substernal region early in the morning. On admission in July 1982, the patient's blood pressure was 120 / 84 mm Hg, and his pulse was 63 bpm and regular. Significant abnormalities were not noted in the physical examination, and the blood chemistry was the normal range. During a chest pain attack on the second hospitalization day, ST segment elevation was recorded at II, III and aV_F, and isosorbide dinitrate was administered sublingually. The patient then developed a ventricular fibrillation (VF) as the ST segment had began to decrease. A direct current shock was used immediately and the VF resolved. A significant <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> artery was not present on the coronary angiography. The arrhythmia during the decrease in the ST segment may be explained as a so-called reperfusion arrhythmia.

After 3 and 6 months, total cholesterol levels in the sera and histological changes in the aorta and coronary artery of chicks fed on 1. 0 %-CHO-containing feed for 3 and 6 months, intimal thickening and marked accumulation of foam cells were observed. Endothelial cells had disappeared in the aorta of these chicks. A slight accumulation of foam cells was observed in the aortic intima of chicks fed on 0. 1 %-CHO-containing feed. In the coronary artery, a remarkable thickening of intima with accumulation of foam cells and a marked <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> space were observed in chicks fed on 1. 0 %-CHO-containing feed.

40|$|The {{assessment}} <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> flow reserve with transthoracic Doppler echocardiography, {{measured as}} the ratio between hyperemic and baseline coronary flow velocities, {{is a new}} tool for the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> artery disease and coronary microcirculation. Color-guided pulsed Doppler allows almost optimal identification of flow velocities at the middle and distal left anterior descending artery and good visualization <b>of</b> the right <b>coronary</b> artery. The development of ultrasound technology (second harmonic, contrast agents, dedicated softwares) is responsible for great feasibility (until 98 % for the left anterior descending artery and 40 - 50 % for the right coronary artery) and very good reproducibility of this tool. Doppler-derived coronary flow reserve has excellent concordance with that obtainable with intravascular Doppler flow wire. Diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>stenosis</b> and restenosis after stent implantation in the middle and/or proximal left anterior descending artery and <b>of</b> <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> the right <b>coronary</b> artery is very accurate. In the absence <b>of</b> <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> epicardial <b>coronary</b> arteries, the reduction in coronary flow reserve implies a damage <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> microcirculation, {{which can be a}} determinant of angina pectoris and signs of myocardial ischemia in arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and coronary X syndrome.

50|$|Limitation {{of blood}} flow to the heart causes {{ischemia}} (cell starvation secondary to a lack of oxygen) of the myocardial cells. Myocardial cells may die from lack of oxygen and this is called a myocardial infarction (commonly called a heart attack). It leads to heart muscle damage, heart muscle death and later myocardial scarring without heart muscle regrowth. Chronic high-grade <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> arteries can induce transient ischemia which leads to the induction of a ventricular arrhythmia, which may terminate into ventricular fibrillation leading to death.|$|R

40|$|No data exist {{comparing}} {{clinical and}} angiographic findings {{in large numbers}} of contemporary African-American and white patients from the same hospital. Limited angiographic data on African Americans were obtained from hospitals serving predominantly minority patients, making the valid African-American:white comparisons difficult. The study included 2, 624 consecutive white and 1, 793 African-American patients who had angiography for diagnostic evaluation of presumed coronary artery disease at the Louisiana State University Medical Center in Shreveport between 1990 and 1997. Compared to whites of the same sex, {{a greater proportion of}} African-American patients had a history of hypertension, stroke, and heart failure. African Americans also had significantly higher systemic and left ventricular pressure, lower ejection fraction, greater echocardiographic left ventricular mass index, and more concentric hypertrophy.

40|$|AbstractLabyrinthine {{function}} is tightly coupled to proper homeostasis. Perturbations in labyrinthine microcirculation {{can lead to}} significant cochlear and/or vestibular dysfunction. Indeed, no studies were conducted to {{examine the effect of}} improvement in cardiac performance after coronary stent application on either hearing or vestibular function. This study included 30 patients presenting to the Catheterization Unit in Sohag University Hospitals. Their age ranged from 41 to 60 years. Those patients were suffering from ischemic heart disease and proved to be candidates for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) and stenting through a list of pre-operative investigations that included: Electrocardiography (ECG), Echocardiography and Coronary angiography. A full battery of audiovestibular investigations was conducted both preoperatively and postoperatively. Significant differences were encountered between preoperative and postoperative auditory brainstem response (ABR) latency measures, transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE), vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) and Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP) tests. Both TEOAE and VEMP proved to be reliable indicators of defective labyrinthine circulation. Severity of chest pain as well as its duration proved to be the best predictors of the degree of total <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> arteries. It can be concluded that affection of the labyrinthine peripheral microcirculation is an intimate consequence of deterioration of cardiac output (COP) secondary to ischemic heart disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of stress-induced cardiomyopathy (takotsubo syndrome) {{have not been}} fully determined. A clinical case {{of the development of}} stressinduced cardio-myopathy in a patient with microvascular angina is presented. A 73 -year-old woman was hospitalized to the cardiology clinic with a diagnosis of acute circular myocardial infarction (elevation ST II, III, aVF, V 2 - 6, positive troponin test). According to coronary angiography <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> arteries were not identified. According to echocardiography the following abnormalities were revealed: decrease in global contractility of the myocardium, hyperkinesia of the basal parts of the left ventricle {{and at the same time}} akinesia of the apex and hypokinesia of the middle segments of the left ventricle. After 1 month a contractility of the myocardium was normal, there were no zones of violation of contractility. It was suggested that the patient had takotsubo syndrome. Anginal pain due to physical and emotional stress with unchanged coronary arteries suggested primary microvascular angina. It was confirmed by the presence of endothelium-dependent vasodilation disorders that were revealed by positron emission tomography of myocardium with cold pressor test and peripheral arterial tonometry. This clinical case demonstrates one of the discussed pathogenetic {{mechanisms of}} the takotsubo syndrome â generalized microvascular spasm. As the patient suffered previously from chronic microvascular angina, it seems logical in this case to regard stress-induced cardiomyopathy as an acute form of microvascular angina...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of 64 -multidetector-row computed tomography angiography (CTA) in comparison to conventional invasive angiography (CIA) in the diagnosis <b>of</b> significant <b>stenosis</b> (â¥ 50) <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> artery tree. METHODS: Assessment of CTA in the detection <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> artery disease (CAD) was performed in patients referred because of symptoms or stress studies suggestive of ischemia. For this purpose, among more than 1000 cases <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> CTA in a 20 months period a study population of 54 patients suspected to have significant <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> artery tree was investigated. The CIA procedure was performed in these patients one month after CTA. The accuracy of CTA in detecting significant stenosis was compared to CIA. RESULTS: For vessel based analysis <b>of</b> 179 <b>coronary</b> vessels, CTA had a sensitivity of 96, specificity of 87. 5, positive predictive value of 90. 5, and negative predictive value of 94. 6. For patient-base analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of CTA were 97. 9, 28. 6, 66. 6, and 90. 2, respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study reveal that CT angiography with 64 -slice scanner could be considered as a suitable technique for rapid triage of patients presenting to hospitals with chest pain. High values of sensitivity and PPV reveal the good performance of CTA in detecting CAD...|$|R

40|$|Kawasaki {{syndrome}} is an acute systemic vasculitis with unknown etiology, affecting primary {{children at the}} age of 0 â 5 years old, which can be of a real threat for health and life not only during acute stage of the disease, but also many years after. The main prognostic factor is involvement <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> arteries with aneurisms development and high risk of consequent thrombosis and/or <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> arteries, which can lead to myocardial ischemia/infarction and sudden death syndrome in young patients. Different variants of long-term pathological changes <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> arteries are discussed in the article. Aneurisms regressed in 50 â 60 % of involved segments <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> arteries within first 2 years after active stage. The probability of regression of aneurisms depends on their diameter, form, localization and patientâs age.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{cause of}} {{coronary artery disease}} is the coronary atherosclerosis which leads to <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> arteries. It has been shown in recent studies, using intravascular ultrasound and contrast-enhanced CT, that early atherosclerosis causes positive coronary artery remodeling, defined as increases in the cross-sectional area. It is hypothesized that detection of artery remodeling using non-contrast CT can be an important factor in sub-clinical assessment of cardiac risk for asymptomatic subjects. However, measuring remodeling in coronary arteries in non-contrast CT images is a challenging task because coronary arteries are small and the intensity of coronary arteries {{is similar to that of}} surrounding tissues. Automatic segmentation algorithms that have been successful in segmenting coronary arteries in contrast-enhanced images do not perform well. To overcome these difficulties, we developed an interactive application to enable effective measurement of coronary artery remodeling in non-contrast CT images. This application is an extension to the 3 D Slicer image analysis platform. It allows users to visualize and trace the centerline of arteries in cross sectional views. The artery centerlines are displayed in a three dimensional view overlaid on the original image volume and color-coded according to the artery labels. Using this 3 D artery model, the user can sample the cross-sectional area of the arteries at selected points for remodeling assessment. Initial validation has demonstrated the effectiveness of this method. A pilot study also showed positive correlation of large coronary artery remodeling with highest lifetime risks. Further evaluation is underway using larger study size and more measurement points...|$|E
40|$|Nonischemic Left Ventricular Scar (NLVS) is {{a pattern}} of {{myocardial}} injury characterized by midventricular and/or subepicardial gadolinium hyper enhancement at cardiac magnetic resonance, in absence of significant coronary artery disease. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of NLVS in juvenile sudden cardiac death and to ascertain its aetiology at autopsy. We examined 281 consecutive cases of sudden death of subjects aged 1 to 35 years of age. NLVS {{was defined as a}} thin, grey rim of subepicardial and/or midmyocardial scar in the left ventricular free wall and/or the septum, in absence of significant <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> arteries. NLVS was the most frequent finding (25 %) in sudden deaths occurring during sports. Myocardial scar was localized most frequently within the left ventricular posterior wall, and affected the subepicardial myocardium, often extending to the midventricular layer. On histology it consisted of fibrous or fibro-adipose tissue. Right ventricular involvement was always present. Patchy lymphocytic infiltrates were frequent. Genetic and molecular analyses clarified the aetiology of NLVS in a subset of cases. ECG recordings were available in over half of subjects. The most frequent abnormality was the presence of low QRS voltages (< 0, 5 mV) in limb leads. In serial ECG tracings, the decrease in QRS voltages appeared, in some way progressive. NLVS is the most frequent morphologic substrate of juvenile cardiac sudden death in sports. It can be suspected based on ECG findings. Autopsy study and clinical screening of family members are required to differentiate between Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/Dysplasia and chronic acquired myocarditis...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. Filtered back {{projection}} (FBP) {{is a common}} way of processing myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) studies. There are artifacts in FBP which can cause falsepositive results. Iterative reconstruction (IR) is developed to reduce false positive findings in MPI studies. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the difference in the number of false positive findings in MPI studies, between FBP and IR processing. Methods. We examined 107 patients with angina pectoris with MPI and coronary angiography (CAG), 77 man and 30 woman, aged 32 â 82. MPI studies were processed with FBP and with IR. Positive finding at MPI was visualization of the perfusion defect. Positive finding at CAG was <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> artery. Perfusion defect at MPI without coronary artery stenosis at CAG was considered like false positive. The results were statistically analyzed with bivariate correlation, and with one sample t-test. Results. There were 20. 6 % normal, and 79. 4 % pathologic findings at FBP, 30. 8 % normal and 69. 2 % pathologic with IR and 37. 4 % normal and 62. 6 % pathologic at CAG. FBP produced 19 false-positive findings, at IR 11 false positive findings. The correlation between FBP and CAG was 0. 658 (p < 0. 01) and between IR and CAG 0. 784 (p < 0. 01). The number of false positive findings at MPI with IR was significantly lower than at FBP (p < 0. 01). Conclusion. Our study shows that IR processing MPI scintigraphy has less number of false positive findings, therefore it is our choice for processing MPI studies...|$|E

40|$|Aim. The {{examination}} {{referred to}} {{two groups of}} female patients: with and without significant coronary stenoses in coronarography. There were two stages of the examination: before and 6 - 9 months after coronarography. The factor dividing patients into two groups: without significant atheromatosis and with coronary atheromatosis, {{was the result of}} invasive diagnostics of coronary heart disease. Methods. The sense of coherence scale (SOC- 29) and sociodemographic questionnaires were used to evaluate the condition of the two groups. Results. In group of patients with irrelevant coronary stenoses statistically lower values of sense of comprehension were noticed in the first and the second examination and also statistically lower values of sense of manage were observed, comparing to the group of patients with significant stenoses. The initial value of general coherence was comparable in both groups and did not significantly change in 6 - 9 months after coronarography. The characteristic parameters: lack of social upport, intensity of depressiveness and anxiety before getting information about necessity of coronarography and worse education were connected with lower sense of coherence. Conclusions. The baseline strength of the total sense of coherence was not different between groups. Patients with no significant <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> arteries demonstrate a lower sense of comprehensibility before and after the coronary arteriography and lower sense of manageability after the procedure compared to the group of patients with significant atherosclerotic lesions. No social support, tendency for depression and anxiety and lower level of education were associated with lower sense of coherence in both groups...|$|E

40|$|Background: In the {{previous}} studies, fasting insulin and apo-lipoproteins are {{considered as one}} of the risk-factor of coronary artery disease (CAD) but did not have the same results. In this study, we attempted to define the association of high fasting insulin and apo-lipoproteins of serum in non-diabetic patients who were afflicted with coronary arteries disease with severity of coronary arteries involvement. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted between September 2011 and February 2012 on three groups, each one consisting of 100 members while using angiographic scores of Gensini with three equal groups with low, medium, and high <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> arteries. The evaluation of non-diabetic patients afflicted with CADs, included the fasting glucose level less than 126 mg/dl or non-consumption of blood glucose reduction drugs or negativity history of diabetes. Results: In this study, there were 300 non-diabetic patients afflicted with CAD in three groups of low, medium, and high extremity. Due to attained results, the patients afflicted with high CAD had a higher level of insulin (18. 3 Â± 0. 8) in relation with low and medium groups (P < 0. 001). As it was observed, the level of serum apo-lipoproteins of A 1 (APO-A 1) in low group of CAD (175 Â± 36. 4) is meaningfully higher than its quantity in high-CAD group (158 Â± 42. 4, P < 0. 001). Furthermore, the quantity of serum apo-lipoproteins of B (APO-B) in mild CAD group (139 Â± 30. 4) is meaningfully less than severe CAD group (155. 21 Â± 29. 7, P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Our findings show that insulin, APO-A 1, APO-B, and total cholesterol measurement is a good case for defining the severity of coronary artery involvement, while high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride are not important risk-factors...|$|E

Conclusion Physicians {{should be aware of the}} presentation of apical ballooning syndrome, and the chest pain after following acute stress should not be readily attributed to anxiety. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cardiovascular disease {{remains the}} 2 nd {{leading cause of}} death in Taiwan; however, the earlier people at a higher risk of {{cardiovascular}} disease start to reduce the risk factors of cardiovascular disease, the lower their chance <b>of</b> developing <b>coronary</b> artery diseases (CAD) or of death will be. As a result, finding out a more effective cardiovascular disease risk assessment tool is critical for people at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Purpose: This study is to analyze the relationship between two cardiovascular disease risk assessment tools and CAD in Taiwan. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional study, in which the records of 438 checkup patients who also do a 640 multi-detector-row computed tomography examination were collected and estimated by two cardiovascular disease risk assessment tools: Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk Score (version 2008) and Pooled Cohort Equations 10 -year ASCVD Risk Estimator. And then, the data were categorized into three groups: (1) patients with <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> one <b>coronary</b> artery blood vesselâ§ 50 %, (2) patients with coronary artery calcification â§ 400, and (3) patients with either <b>stenosis</b> <b>of</b> one <b>coronary</b> artery blood vesselâ§ 50 % or coronary artery calcificationâ§ 400 and analyzed with logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) methods. Results: Both logistic regression analysis and the ROC analysis show the 10 -year ASCVD Risk Estimator has a higher correlation with all the three groups than Framinghan risk scores (logistic regression analysis: P< 0. 000 ï¼OR= 1. 06 ï¼ 95 %CI= 1. 00 - 1. 12; ROC analysis: AUC = 0. 709). Conclusion:Pooled Cohort Equations 10 -year ASCVD Risk Estimator is the most effective risk assessment tool to predict coronary artery disease risks for people in Taiwan.
