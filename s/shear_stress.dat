X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted.

The results of data analysis showed that the <b>shearing</b> <b>stress</b> of wheat stems decreased as the moisture content decreased. The shearing force of stems, decreased as the cutting height of stalk increased, because of a reduction in stalk diameter. <b>Shearing</b> <b>stress</b> was lower by using smooth edge knife, because of less friction than serrated one. The blade oblique angle of 30 degree showed the least <b>shearing</b> <b>stress.</b> The average of <b>shearing</b> <b>stress</b> varied between 3. 25 and 3. 86 MPa.

25|$|Depending on {{the initial}} void ratio, the soil {{material}} can respond to loading either strain-softening or strain-hardening. Strain-softened soils, e.g. loose sands, can be triggered to collapse, either monotonically or cyclically, if the static <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> {{is greater than the}} ultimate or steady-state shear strength of the soil. In this case flow liquefaction occurs, where the soil deforms at a low constant residual <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> If the soil strain-hardens, e.g. moderately dense to dense sand, flow liquefaction will generally not occur. However, cyclic softening can occur due to cyclic undrained loading, e.g. earthquake loading. Deformation during cyclic loading will depend on the density of the soil, the magnitude and duration of the cyclic loading, and amount of <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> reversal. If stress reversal occurs, the effective <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> could reach zero, then cyclic liquefaction can take place. If stress reversal does not occur, zero effective stress is not possible to occur, then cyclic mobility takes place.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{boundary}} element method is {{developed for the}} nonuniform torsion of simply or multiply connected prismatic bars of arbitrary cross section. The bar is subjected to an arbitrarily distributed twisting moment, while its edges are restrained by the most general linear torsional boundary conditions. Since warping is prevented, beside the Saint-Venant torsional <b>shear</b> <b>stresses,</b> the warping normal and <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> are also computed. Three boundary value problems {{with respect to the}} variable along the beam angle of twist and to the primary and secondary warping functions are formulated and solved employing a BEM approach. Both the warping and the torsion constants using only boundary discretization together with the torsional <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> and the warping normal and <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> are computed. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the method and demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy.

40|$|Numerous {{studies in}} tissue {{engineering}} and biomechanics use fluid flow stimulation, both unidirectional and oscillatory, {{to analyze the}} effects of <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> on cell behavior. However, it has typically been assumed that these <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> are uniform and that cell and substrate properties do not adversely affect these assumptions. With the increasing utilization of fluid flow in cell biology, it would be beneficial to determine the validity of various experimental protocols. Because {{it is difficult to}} determine the velocity profiles and <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> empirically, we used the finite element method (FEM). Using FEM, we determined the effects of cell confluence on fluid flow, the effects of cell height on the uniformity of <b>shear</b> <b>stresses,</b> apparent <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> exhibited by cells cultured on various substrates, and the effects of oscillatory fluid flow relative to the unidirectional flow. FEM analyses could successfully analyze flow patterns over cells for various cell confluence and shape and substrate characteristics. Our data suggest the benefits of the utilization of oscillatory fluid flow and the use of substrates that stimulate cell spreading in the distribution of more uniform <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> across the surface of cells. Also we demonstrated that the cells cultured on nanotopographies were exposed to greater apparent <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> than cells on flat controls when using the same fluid flow conditions. FEM thus provides an excellent tool for the development of experimental protocols and the design of bioreactor systems...|$|R

25|$|Shear {{strength}} {{is a term}} used in soil mechanics to describe {{the magnitude of the}} <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> that a soil can sustain. The shear resistance of soil is a result of friction and interlocking of particles, and possibly cementation or bonding at particle contacts. Due to interlocking, particulate material may expand or contract in volume as it is subject to shear strains. If soil expands its volume, the density of particles will decrease and the strength will decrease; in this case, the peak strength would be followed by a reduction of <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> The stress-strain relationship levels off when the material stops expanding or contracting, and when interparticle bonds are broken. The theoretical state at which the <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> and density remain constant while the shear strain increases may be called the critical state, steady state, or residual strength.|$|E

25|$|Vascular remodelling in non-embryonic tissues is {{considered}} to be symptomatic of disease progression. Cardiovascular disease {{remains one of the most}} common causes of death globally and is often associated with the blockage or stenosis of blood vessels, which can have dramatic biomechanical effects. In acute and chronic remodelling, the increase in <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> due to the decreased diameter of a blocked vessel can cause vasodilation, thereby restoring typical <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> levels. However, dilation also leads to increased blood flow through the vessel, which can result in hyperaemia, affect physiological regulatory actions downstream of the afflicted vessel, and place increased pressure on atherosclerotic plaques which may lead to rupture. Blockage of blood vessels is currently treated by surgically inserting stents to force vessel diameters open and restore normal blood flow.
