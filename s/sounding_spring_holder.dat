The particle characteristics are shown to be measurable by computing the scattering cross-section originating in the propagation of dust acoustic waves. The choice of optimal particle parameters depends on two competitive effects.

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. Patients with {{disorders}} such as Essential Tremors and Parkinson's Disease often {{lose their}} ability to write with a pen or pencil. This raises inconveniences in everyday living. A pen has been designed that enables many of these patients to sign their name, write etc. that works solely by mechanical principals, inertia of a <b>spring</b> suspended pen <b>holder</b> inside an outer case which resists movement when used by the patient holding the outer case. The pen can be carried in a large pocket, backpack, or briefcase. Prototypes of the pen have been made from easily available parts, such as PVC pipe, Al tubing, rubber bands, and lead fishing weights. Mass spring equations are presented to help model the optimum weight and rubber band tensions. This thesis builds on research by Dr. Kumagai of California State University Sacramento, a professor and graduate students Kosuke Naritomi, and Tyrone Tracy. They have designed and made a working model of the essential tremor pen and the model discussed here is an improvement in some aspects. The prototypes show {{that it is possible}} to design a pen that reduces the effect of tremors, using the proposed design, if the inertia in the pen body is optimised for the particular patiant, at least when the persons tremor is mild.

40|$|Driven by {{miniaturization}} and {{the continuing}} increase in clock speed and data transfer, power dissipation in many electronic components has exceeded the limits of conventional cooling methodologies, such as fan-blown air cooling. Given the expected increase in power density, microprocessor designers have identified cooling {{as one of the}} major challenges for the next decade. Similar needs arise from the further development of other electronic devices such as Light Emitting Diodes (LED), where future generations of high light-output multichip LED modules are being developed for general and automotive illumination applications as well as for power electronics. Hence, there is a tremendous need for innovative cooling technologies. One of the most important factors in reducing the lifetime of micro-electronic components is the high operation temperature and thermal cycling. Liquid cooling has been identified {{as one of the most}} promising solutions in reducing the operation temperature of high power electronics. Liquid cooling is often not optimized, leading to excess of cooling and large temperature variations over the IC. If the coolant is allowed to boil in the cooling channels, the heat transfer coefficient is increased with one order of magnitude. The problem of phase transition regime is the boiling instability. A solution of these problems is addressed by implementation of valves in the cooling system. For single-phase systems they have the role of maintaining a more uniform temperature over the IC and to reduce the pumping power. For two-phase systems the valve purpose is to maintain the most optimum boiling conditions. A comparative study of different actuation principles was performed to identify the best actuation technology applied for chip cooling valves which meet the cooling requirements targeted in this PhD project. This classifies the valve size between the micro and macro-scale, a field which has been mainly overlooked by prior research and potentially promising applications have not been yet explored. It is for the first time that valves are especially designed for chip cooling applications. The principal requirements for the mechanical valves are the following: no leakage to the environment, low power consumption, continuous and proportional flow control, low cost, fast response time, small size and high reliability. The most promising actuation technology found for single-phase flow is thermopneumatic actuation. Based on this principle, a valve has been designed manufactured and tested on a cooling system. The valve actuation is performed by the thermal expansion of a liquid (actuation fluid) which, at the same time, actuates the valve and provides feed-back sensing. The thermopneumatic valve shows a novel actuation principle that combines the advantages of zero power consumption, small size compared with the high flow rate, and low manufacturing costs. This valve has the major advantage that it can be used together with any heat sink used for microelectronic cooling. Its small size and its independence from external energy make it suited for portable devices. No electrical connection, no wires and no electronic control are needed, increasing its simplicity and reliability. A maximum flow rate of 38 kg/h passes through the valve for a heat load up to 133 W. The valve is able to reduce the pumping power by up to 60 % and has the capability to reduce the temperature variation over the IC with up to 24 %. The most suitable actuation principle found for two-phase cooling is electro- magnetic actuation for large bandwidth, large forces, relatively high strokes and low manufacturing cost. The electromagnetic valve uses the reluctance actuation principle. It makes use of a pilot valve to reduce the size and the required actuation force. The emphasis is placed on a compact planar design to fit in planar devices. A pressure balance design allows operation at high system pressures. Because the pressure balance is used to drive the valve, an analytical and numerical model has been developed to predict the pressure distribution over the valve. The pilot valve has also been modelled as well and linearised using the results obtained from the model. The results of the model have been successfully validated by measurements. The valve is capable to control a flow rate up to 15 kg/h. This flow rate is sufficient to remove a heat input of 133 W equivalent with a heat flux of 500 W/cm 2 at a temperature difference of 20 deg. C. Its equilibrated design allows a pressure drop control of up to 100 kPa at maximum system pressures of 600 kPa. Compared with the latest research published in literature and the latest developments in industry, this electromagnetic valve classifies on top of the list when it comes to the following combined properties in a single package: high speed proportional control, compact dimensions, high flow rates at low pressure drop, high reliability and low manufacturing cost. This research demonstrates the need for valves and the benefits of using valves in high performance cooling systems.
