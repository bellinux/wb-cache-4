5|$|Alice, heavily {{pregnant}} with her third child, saw Louis depart to command the Hessian cavalry against the Prussians, and sent her children to stay with Queen Victoria in England. Despite her pregnancy, she performed the royal duties expected of her sex and station, making bandages for troops and preparing hospitals. On 11 July, {{she gave birth to}} Princess Irene; Prussian troops {{were on the verge of}} entering Darmstadt, she begged the Grand Duke to surrender on Prussia's terms. This provoked fury from the fiercely anti-Prussian Prince Alexander, but Alice realised that the conquered German states would likely form a union which <b>she,</b> <b>like</b> her sister Victoria, supported.|$|E
5|$|Her {{most infamous}} antic was giving Ozy a haircut only to accidentally shave off all his fur. Although she is {{normally}} manic, {{she also has}} a strong sense of justice, facing the inexplicable wrongs of life and the world she sees. However, her rebellions are mostly limited to annoying her mother, playing jokes on Ozy and disrupting the peace at school. None of which matters any less to her, as long as she has fun doing it. Millie says aloud what others think, and does what others, for fear of reaction from the people around them, would not dare. <b>She,</b> <b>like</b> Ozy, often tries to answer the most important questions in life, but her method of finding the answers makes her unique.|$|E
5|$|Hikari Konohana, a shy {{and quiet}} girl, {{is the main}} focus among the main {{characters}} who attend Spica. The next Spica character is Yaya Nanto, a rebellious girl who is Hikari's best friend and roommate in the dormitory. In the anime, she is very much enamored with Hikari, but Hikari sees her as a friend; in the manga, Yaya is not a prominent character. Both she and Hikari {{are members of the}} St. Spica Choir. Hikari meets an older girl named Amane Ohtori early on in the story who is seen much like a prince from a fairy tale by other Spica students due to often riding a white horse named Star Bright. Amane is admired by many of the students from Spica as well as students from the other two schools, although she does not enjoy the attention. In the anime, Hikari admires her deeply, and she and Amane have mutual interest in each other. The final girl from Spica is Tsubomi Okuwaka, a young first year student who acts maturely for her age and gets on Yaya's nerves. She too is in the St. Spica Choir, although Hikari was her main motivation for joining. In the anime, her interest in Hikari seems to purely be one of friendship; in the manga, <b>she,</b> <b>like</b> Yaya, is not a prominent character. Tsubomi once remarked that Yaya was more skilled than Hikari at singing in the choir.|$|E

Dancing with a new partner is a study in flexibility and calibration. What can the new partner do? What are his or her limitations? What does he or <b>she</b> <b>like</b> to do? Dancing with a regular partner is an opportunity to play and practice difficult moves, such as aerials (which are dangerous without regular practice).|$|E
25|$|It was {{not with}} the {{suspicious}} and timid steps of a prisoner that she went to meet the conqueror when summoned by him, but rather in the hope and confidence of a mother in distress who goes to see her foster child.

Sister Vitaline suggested that perhaps Our Lady was visible only to the children.

25|$|In contrast, Macon Dead Jr.'s sister, Pilate, {{is seen as}} nurturing—an Earth Mother character. Born {{without a}} navel, she is a {{somewhat}} mystical character. It is strongly implied that she is Divine—a female Christ—in spite of her name. Macon (Jr.) has not spoken to his sister for years and does not think highly of her. <b>She,</b> <b>like</b> Macon, has had to fend for herself {{from an early age}} after their father's murder, but she has dealt with her past in a different way than Macon, who has embraced money as the way to show his love for his father. Pilate has a daughter, Reba, and a granddaughter named Hagar. Hagar falls desperately and obsessively in love with Milkman, and is unable to cope with his rejection, attempting to kill him at least six times.|$|E
25|$|In 479, Ariadne {{came into}} {{conflict}} with her husband {{over the fate of}} her mother. Verina had attempted to assassinate Illus and had become his prisoner. She had supported the revolt of her other son-on-law Marcian even during her captivity. Ariadne endeavoured to obtain her release, first from Zeno, and then from Illus, to whom the emperor referred her. Illus not only refused her request, but charged her with wishing to place another person on her husband's throne. This irritated her; and <b>she,</b> <b>like</b> her mother, attempted to assassinate Illus. Jordanes ascribes her hatred to another cause: he says that Illus had infused jealous suspicions into Zeno's mind which had led Zeno to attempt her life, and that her knowledge of these things stimulated her to revenge. The assassin whom she employed failed to kill Illus, but cut off his ear in the attempt. The assassin was taken, and Zeno, who appears to have been privy to the affair, was unable to prevent his execution.|$|E
25|$|In the women's events, Filzmoser {{participated in}} the women's -57 kg. <b>She,</b> <b>like</b> both male competitors, was {{eliminated}} {{in the first round}} she competed in. Nekoda Smythe-Davis of Great Britain overpowered her, finishing the match with a 000–011 scoreline. Unterwurzacher competed in the women's -63 kg event. Her first bout was in the round of 16 against two-time Olympian Estefania García of Ecuador, which she won 010–000 with a waza-ari. Her next game was against Miku Tashiro of Japan. Tashiro beat Unterwurzacher with a yuko, and so Unterwurzacher moved to the repechage match against Anicka van Emden of Netherlands. Mirroring the previous score, Unterwurzacher lost by a waza-ari 000–001. She ranked seventh overall. Graf had a similar system. She beat Maria Portela in a 000–000 contest due to a shido, but lost her next game against Laura Vargas Koch by an ippon. Unlike Unterwurzacher, Graf won the repechage bout against Kelitae Zupancic 010–001. In the bronze medal match, Graf competed against Sally Conway of Great Britain. She lost it 000 to 001.

25|$|Mai's role is more {{prominent}} in the anime. Early in the season she had problems with constantly moving; because she thought everyone hated her after making friends and then abandoning them, she became so depressed that she refused to go to school. She understood {{the impact of their}} journeys on others, but unlike Ai, did not have the maturity to cope with it. Early on in the series she makes friends with a classmate of hers, Konami. When it was time for Mai to leave, Konami helped convince Mai that she was wrong and in consolation Konami left a sketch portrait of Mai she made for a class assignment as a departing gift stating that they will remain friends forever, even if they never see each other again. While waiting for Mai's return, Konami passes away two years before the mansion is in a location where the two could meet again. Later in the series, Mai meets Konami's daughter; she initially mistakes her for Konami but quickly learns her name is Mai and that she was named by Konami in memory of her friend. Mai discovers that Konami's daughter has more in common with her than a name: <b>she,</b> <b>like</b> her namesake, feels that everyone hates her. As a result, Mai feels it her duty to both Konami and her daughter to show her that way of thinking was wrong, just as Konami did for her. Mai ultimately gave up and failed at the time when she Konami had still been waiting for her even as she lay dying. This, compounded with Keith's words about the pain the girls bring to others, reawakening her depression in a much deeper manner. When she returns to visit Konami later and leaves, as a departing request, asks Konami to explain to her daughter what she felt so that she would not follow the same path as the younger sister Mai. Along with Mea, the maid, Mai is left at one point when the mansion disappears into the future without them. It is during this time that Mai realizes that she cannot age and Ai explains the connection to the mansion and aging process. Mai is voiced by Mio Oukawa in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Masumi Asano and in English by Nicole Bouma.|$|E

I had {{to do a lot of}} thinking about what we would do with her. Where would she be now? I did a lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now.

[...] Similarly, Empire critic Ian Freer felt that Larson gave [...] "a whirling dervish of a performance ... <b>She,</b> <b>like</b> the film, breaks your heart and raises your spirit in one fell swoop." ...|$|E
