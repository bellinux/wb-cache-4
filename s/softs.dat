5|$|The Grand Prix was contested by eleven teams, each of two drivers. The teams, {{also known}} as constructors, were McLaren, Ferrari, Jordan, Jaguar, Williams, Benetton, Prost, Sauber, Arrows, Minardi and BAR.

5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race; these started the race fitted with the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. It was held in overcast weather conditions. Tyre degradation on the soft compound tyres was heavy; the drivers set their laps on the hard tyres during the first session and switched to <b>softs</b> for the two remaining sessions.|$|E

30|$|Recently, in 2011, Shabir and Naz [23] and Cagman et al. [24] {{initiated}} {{the study of}} <b>soft</b> topology and <b>soft</b> topological spaces independently. Shabir and Naz [23] defined <b>soft</b> topology on the collection τ of <b>soft</b> sets over X. Consequently, they defined basic notions of <b>soft</b> topological spaces such as <b>soft</b> open and closed sets, <b>soft</b> subspace, <b>soft</b> closure, <b>soft</b> nbd of a point, <b>soft</b> T i spaces, i= 1, 2, 3, 4, <b>soft</b> regular spaces, and <b>soft</b> normal spaces and established their several properties. In [25], we presented further several important properties of notions defined and studied in [23]. On the other hand, Cagman et al. [24] introduced a <b>soft</b> topology on a <b>soft</b> set and defined a <b>soft</b> topological space. They defined basic notions and concepts of <b>soft</b> topological spaces such as <b>soft</b> open and closed sets, <b>soft</b> interior, <b>soft</b> closure, <b>soft</b> basis, <b>soft</b> nbd of a point, <b>soft</b> limit point of a <b>soft</b> set, <b>soft</b> complement, <b>soft</b> difference, and <b>soft</b> boundary and established several properties of these <b>soft</b> notions.

25|$|Commodity ETFs trade provide {{exposure}} to an increasing range of commodities and commodity indices, including energy, metals, <b>softs</b> and agriculture.

25|$|Commodity ETFs trade {{just like}} shares, are simple and {{efficient}} and provide exposure to an ever-increasing range of commodities and commodity indices, including energy, metals, <b>softs</b> and agriculture. However, {{it is important}} for an investor to realize that there are often other factors that affect the price of a commodity ETF that might not be immediately apparent. For example, buyers of an oil ETF such as USO might think that as long as oil goes up, they will profit roughly linearly. What isn't clear to the novice investor is the method by which these funds gain exposure to their underlying commodities. In the case of many commodity funds, they simply roll so-called front-month futures contracts from month to month. This does give exposure to the commodity, but subjects the investor to risks involved in different prices along the term structure, such as a high cost to roll.|$|E
25|$|Diamond turning – This type is cut and {{polished}} on a CNC lathe. The lens starts {{out as a}} cylindrical disk held in the jaws of the lathe that is equipped with an industrial-grade diamond as the cutting tool. The CNC lathe may turn at nearly 6000 RPM as the cutter removes the desired amount of material {{from the inside of}} the lens. The concave (inner) surface of the lens is then polished with some fine abrasive paste, oil, and a small polyester cotton ball turned at high speeds. To hold the delicate lens in reverse manner, wax is used as an adhesive. The lens' convex (outer) surface is thus cut {{and polished}} by the same process. This method can be used to shape rigid as well as soft lenses. In the case of <b>softs,</b> the lens is cut from a dehydrated polymer that is rigid until water is reintroduced.|$|E

25|$|In Japan, Räikkönen {{came very}} close to another podium, {{finishing}} fourth. He had qualified fifth and was not able to gain a place {{at the start of the}} race, as he was on hard tyres. He put on <b>softs</b> for his second stint and was able to close in on Nick Heidfeld at about three-quarters of a second every lap. He overtook the German after the BMW Sauber came out of the pits. However, an accident involving Toro Rosso's Jaime Alguersuari brought out the safety car on lap 44, which kept the field stationary for a further five laps. Despite Lewis Hamilton suffering a KERS failure, Räikkönen's car did not have the grip necessary and was not able to overtake the third-placed McLaren at the restart. He went wide in an attempt to overtake Hamilton but recovered without losing a further place to Nico Rosberg.|$|E

At the head of the field, Vettel built a two-second lead in the first four laps over Hamilton, but then Hamilton slowly started reeling him back in as the super <b>softs</b> slowly began to wear out. Before the first round of pit stops, Hamilton closed right up to Vettel and started to get held up, with Fernando Alonso taking the {{opportunity}} to join the leading two. The stops started as early as lap 13 for Massa, and on lap 14 for di Resta and Michael Schumacher. Vettel stayed until lap 16 before pitting, handing the lead to Hamilton who came in on the next lap and rejoined ahead of Vettel, despite a slow pitstop.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, {{after the}} release of Six, Hopper left and was {{replaced}} by Roy Babbington, another former Nucleus member, who had already contributed with double bass on Fourth and Fifth and took up (6-string) electric bass successfully, while Karl Jenkins progressively took over the role of band-leader and main composer. After they released Seven (1973) without additional musicians, the band switched record labels from Columbia to Harvest. On their 1975 album, Bundles, a significant musical change occurred with fusion guitarist Allan Holdsworth adding guitar as a very prominent melody instrument to the band's sound, sometimes reminiscent of John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra, setting the album apart from previous Soft Machine releases, which had rarely featured guitars. On the last official studio album <b>Softs</b> (1976), Holdsworth was replaced by John Etheridge. Ratledge, the last remaining original member of the band, had left during the early stages of recording. Other musicians in the band during the later period were bassists Percy Jones (of Brand X) and Steve Cook, saxophonists Alan Wakeman and Ray Warleigh, and violinist Ric Sanders. Their 1977 performances and record (titled Alive and Well, ironically) were among the last for Soft Machine as a working band, their very last performance (until the 1984 reformation) being the only Soft Machine concert of 1978.|$|E

2500|$|While rigid lenses {{have been}} around for about 120 years, soft lenses are a much more recent development. The {{principal}} breakthrough in soft contact lenses made by Otto Wichterle led to the launch of the first soft (hydrogel) lenses in some countries in the 1960s and the approval of the [...] "Soflens" [...] daily material (polymacon) by the FDA in the US in 1971. <b>Softs</b> are usually comfortable right after insertion, while rigids require a period of adaptation before some comfort, if any, is achieved.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "daily wear" [...] (DW) contact lens is {{designed}} to be worn for one day and removed prior to sleeping. An [...] "extended wear" [...] (EW) contact lens {{is designed}} for continuous overnight wear, typically for up to 6 consecutive nights. Newer materials, such as silicone hydrogels, allow for even longer wear periods of up to 30 consecutive nights; these longer-wear lenses are often referred to as [...] "continuous wear" [...] (CW). EW and CW contact lenses can be worn overnight because of their high oxygen permeability. While awake, the eyes are mostly open, allowing oxygen from the air to dissolve into the tears and pass through the lens to the cornea. While asleep, oxygen is supplied from the blood vessels {{in the back of the}} eyelid. [...] A lens hindering passage of oxygen to the cornea causes corneal hypoxia which can result in serious complications, such as corneal ulcer that, if left untreated, can permanently decrease vision. EW and CW contact lenses typically allow for a transfer of 5–6 times more oxygen than conventional <b>softs,</b> allowing the cornea to remain healthy, even with closed eyelids.|$|E
