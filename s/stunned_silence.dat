Kotar, who could have blocked him or fallen on the ball himself, never even saw the fumble, according to Edwards.

The only noise came from the celebrating Eagles.|$|E
25|$|Included as a {{replacement}} for Alan Kippax, Bradman walked to the crease {{on the first day of}} the second Test at the MCG with the score at 2/67. A world record crowd of 63,993 provided a standing ovation that delayed play for several minutes. Anticipating the bouncer first ball, Bradman moved across to play the hook shot, but the ball failed to rise and he dragged it onto his stumps, making his initial first-ball duck in a Test. The crowd fell into <b>stunned</b> <b>silence</b> as he walked off.|$|E
25|$|Later that year, {{following}} {{the example of}} a friend Joe Wallace (Jason Rush) who had told his parents about being gay and HIV-positive, Mark decides to tell his parents. By now, he is dating Rachel Kominski (Jacquetta May), who advises him not to but Mark is tired of the pretence. On Boxing Day Mark tells Pauline and Arthur that he is HIV-positive. They sit in <b>stunned</b> <b>silence</b> while he scatters helpful leaflets around the house and then goes away for a while. On his return, he faces Pauline's irrational terror and Arthur's hostility. Arthur's ignorance is apparent initially as he fears that Mark will pass HIV on to him; he even bleaches everything Mark touches to avoid infection. Pauline and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) are understandably distraught but help Arthur to understand the illness, and are a huge support to Mark. Mark's relationship with Rachel ends, and the animosity at home send Mark back to his girlfriend Gill, who moves to London and becomes seriously ill. Gill's HIV has already progressed into AIDS and her deterioration is rapid. She is diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and goes into a hospice. Mark realises that he is in love with her and asks her to marry him. Mark and Gill marry, and their honeymoon consists of one night in a hotel, before Gill returns to the hospice and dies.|$|E

500|$|The public clamoured for {{the return}} of Bradman to defeat Bodyline: [...] "he was the batsman who could conquer this cankerous bowling... 'Bradmania', amounting almost to {{religious}} fervour, demanded his return". Recovered from his indisposition, Bradman returned to the side in Alan Kippax's position. A world record crowd of 63,993 at the MCG saw Bradman come to the crease {{on the first day of}} the Second Test with the score at 2/67. A standing ovation ensued that delayed play for several minutes. Bradman anticipated receiving a bouncer as his first ball and, as the bowler delivered, he moved across his stumps to play the hook shot. The ball failed to rise and Bradman dragged it onto his stumps; the first-ball duck was his first in a Test. The crowd fell into <b>stunned</b> <b>silence</b> as he walked off. However, Australia took a first innings lead in the match, and another record crowd on 2 January 1933 watched Bradman hit a counter-attacking second innings century. His unbeaten 103 (from 146balls) in a team total of 191 helped set England a target of 251 to win. Bill O'Reilly and Bert Ironmonger bowled Australia to a series-levelling victory amid hopes that Bodyline was beaten.|$|E

40|$|Queuing up to buy myself {{lunch in}} the media tent at CHOGM {{a couple of weeks}} ago, I came across a {{depressing}} scene. A British journalist was haranguing the three people behind the counter, one of them on the verge of tears, the others <b>stunned</b> into <b>silence,</b> because the opening hours of the cafeteria didn’t suit his work schedule. It’s difficult to stand by while someone loudly makes the same point again and again, especially when you’re hungry, so I mildly suggested that he take up the question with someone who might conceivably have some control over opening hours, rather than harrassing the counter staff...|$|R

The pair were close friends, and shook hands before putting their arms around one another's shoulders. The condemned bowler did not take Egar's judgment personally and did not have hard feelings about the incident. Egar claimed to be [...] "the second most upset person in the world", and later added that he thought Meckiff's first ball was suspect. He said that he could have called more deliveries, but was worried whether the over would ever end.|$|R
500|$|Kurt invites Blaine to the McKinley junior prom in [...] "Prom Queen". The {{attendees}} greet Karofsky's {{election as}} Prom King with great enthusiasm, but a <b>stunned</b> <b>silence</b> falls when Kurt is declared Prom Queen due to having received an {{overwhelming number of}} unwanted write-in votes in the secret balloting. Humiliated, Kurt flees in tears, but is able to calm down and return for his coronation; his comment—"Eat your heart out, Kate Middleton"—garners applause that swells into an ovation. The traditional dance between King and Queen is next, and Karofsky is faced with having to partner with a boy {{in front of his}} classmates. He rejects Kurt's suggestion to come out at the prom, and abandons Kurt on the dance floor as the music begins; Blaine dances with Kurt instead. At the end of the season, the glee club travels to the Nationals competition in New York City. Kurt and Rachel sneak into the Gershwin Theatre where Wicked is playing, and from the stage they sing [...] "For Good", a song from the musical. They both decide to come back to New York after graduation. New Directions finishes in twelfth place at Nationals, and upon Kurt's return to Ohio, he and Blaine declare their love for one another.|$|E
500|$|In 1928 Whale {{was offered}} the {{opportunity}} to direct two private performances of R.C. Sherriff's then-unknown play Journey's End for the Incorporated Stage Society, a theatre society that mounted private Sunday performances of plays. Set over a four-day period in March 1918 in the trenches at Saint-Quentin, France, Journey's End gives {{a glimpse into the}} experiences of the officers of a British infantry company in World War I. The key conflict is between Capt. Stanhope, the company commander, and Lt. Raleigh, the brother of Stanhope's fiancée. Whale offered the part of Stanhope to the then barely known Laurence Olivier. Olivier initially declined the role, but after meeting the playwright agreed to take it on. Maurice Evans was cast as Raleigh. The play was well received and transferred to the Savoy Theatre in London's West End, opening on 21 January 1929. A young Colin Clive was now in the lead role, Olivier having accepted an offer {{to take the lead in}} a production of Beau Geste. [...] The play was a tremendous success, with critics uniform and effusive in their praise and with audiences sometimes sitting in <b>stunned</b> <b>silence</b> following its conclusion only to burst into thunderous ovations. As Whale biographer James Curtis wrote, the play [...] "managed to coalesce, at the right time and in the right manner, the impressions of a whole generation of men who were in the war and who had found it impossible, through words or deeds, to adequately express to their friends and families what the trenches had been like". After three weeks at the Savoy, Journey's End transferred to the Prince of Wales Theatre, where it ran for the next two years.|$|E

When the main talkie feature begins, however, the audience falls {{into a state of}} <b>stunned,</b> emotionless <b>silence.</b> This has been interpreted as Asquith's own comment on the phenomenon. Writing in the New York Times in 2007, critic Dave Kehr surmised that [...] "many filmmakers, Asquith apparently included, believed that silent storytelling had reached such a high level of refinement that mere chatter would never be enough to extinguish it." ...|$|R

[...] They won the NFC South title with a 12-4 record—the team's best ever—then defeated the San Francisco 49ers in what became coach Steve Mariucci's last game with that franchise. In a surprising upset, the Bucs won their first NFC Championship on the road against the Eagles in the last NFL game ever played at Veterans Stadium. Cornerback Ronde Barber capped off the win by intercepting a Donovan McNabb pass and returning it 92 {{yards for a touchdown}} late in the fourth quarter.

The next year, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then director of the International Monetary Fund and considered a leading candidate to challenge Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2012 French presidential election, was arrested and charged with the attempted rape of a hotel housekeeper. French journalists covering the incident in New York were <b>stunned</b> into <b>silence</b> when a handcuffed Strauss-Kahn was brought by them.

5000|$|In the {{following}} scene, Macbeth and Banquo discuss {{the weather and}} their victory. As they wander onto a heath, the Three Witches enter and greet them with prophecies. Though Banquo challenges them first, they address Macbeth, hailing him as [...] "Thane of Glamis," [...] "Thane of Cawdor," [...] and that he shall [...] "be King hereafter." [...] Macbeth appears to be <b>stunned</b> to <b>silence.</b> When Banquo asks of his own fortunes, the witches respond paradoxically, saying {{that he will be}} less than Macbeth, yet happier, less successful, yet more. He will father a line of kings though he himself will not be one. While the two men wonder at these pronouncements, the witches vanish, and another thane, Ross, arrives and informs Macbeth of his newly bestowed title: Thane of Cawdor. The first prophecy is thus fulfilled, and Macbeth, previously skeptical, immediately begins to harbour ambitions of becoming king.|$|R

The House was <b>stunned</b> into <b>silence,</b> but on recovering proposed that the Bank of England should be invited to make a better offer. In response, the South Sea increased its cash payment to £3.5 million, while the Bank proposed to undertake the conversion with a payment of £5.5 million and a fixed conversion price of £170 per £100 face value Bank stock. On 1 February, the company negotiators led by Blunt raised their offer to £4 million plus a proportion of £3.5 million depending on how much of the debt was converted. They also agreed that the interest rate would reduce after four years instead of seven, and agreed to sell on behalf of the government £1 million of Exchequer bills (formerly handled by the Bank). The House accepted the South Sea offer. Bank stock fell sharply.|$|R

2500|$|On September 7, 1927, Farnsworth's image {{dissector}} camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, to a receiver in another room of his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. Pem Farnsworth recalled in 1985 that her husband broke the <b>stunned</b> <b>silence</b> of his lab assistants by saying, [...] "There you are — electronic television!" [...] The source of the image was a glass slide, backlit by an arc lamp. An extremely bright source was required because of the low light sensitivity of the design. By 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. His backers had demanded to know when they would see dollars from the invention; so the first image shown was, appropriately, a dollar sign. In 1929, the design was further improved by elimination of a motor-generator; so the television system now had no mechanical parts. [...] That year Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images using his television system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Pem.|$|E
50|$|But {{then came}} {{one of the}} most {{astonishing}} comebacks of all time, rivalling the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final in its suddenness. In the 73rd minute, after some pinball in the Jordan box, striker Husaam Fawzi swivelled and cracked a low shot from 10 yards into the bottom corner. The crowd, still celebrating, were then <b>stunned</b> into <b>silence</b> when the forward outpaced Amjad al Taher and then earned a penalty when the defender tripped him. The striker dusted himself down and sent Muhammad Abu Dawud the wrong way from the spot for his 6th goal of the tournament. The Iraqis then cut the deficit to just one on 77 minutes when Haidar Mahmoud got a free header from six yards. The Iraqis, smelling blood, completed the comeback with just three minutes left when Mahmoud knocked on a cross for Razzaq Farhan to half volley home from just inside the box. The home fans were stunned into submission, and their team could not get going. Iraq, still tired from their exerts, could not find a fifth, and so the match went to penalties.|$|R
