Population inversion in these lasers is built-up due to selective relaxation routes of optically excited electrons into impurity ground state.

These unique properties make Ge a promising material {{for the development of}} metal-oxide semiconductor eld e ect transistors (MOSFETs). Point defects in semiconductors in uence the electronic structure as well as the thermodynamic and optical properties of the material. Well-known defects in Ge have been intensively studied experimentally and results reported. In the past, defects in Ge were di cult to study theoretically, since the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) incorrectly predict Ge to be a metal. However, the screened hybrid functional developed by Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof (HSE) accurately predicts the band gap and gives better estimates of the charge state transition levels of point defects in semiconductors. This thesis reports the results of DFT calculations using the HSE 06 functional to predict the structural, electronic and charge state thermodynamic properties of Ge di-interstitials, rare earth (RE) substitutional and interstitial impurities as well as vacancy-RE impurity complexes in Ge. Results obtained showed that the Ge di-interstitial could exist in three con gurations with formation energies between 6. 53 and 7. 63 eV. The lowest energy con guration was the double tetrahedral con guration with a binding energy of 1. 24 eV. This con guration induced only a <b>shallow</b> <b>donor</b> <b>level</b> at an energy of 0. 04 eV below the conduction band minimum. Other con gurations of the Ge di-interstitial exhibited negative-U ordering. RE interstitials in Ge formed with formation energies between − 4. 76 and 6. 71 eV, with the Pr interstitial in Ge having the lowest formation energy at − 4. 76 eV for the neutral charge state in the tetrahedral con guration. The tetrahedral con guration was the most stable con guration for the Ce, Pr, Eu and Tm, while the Er interstitial showed charge state controlled metastability. While the Ce interstitial induced a <b>shallow</b> <b>donor</b> <b>level</b> in the band gap, the Eu and Er interstitials induced deep levels within the band gap of Ge. The Pr interstitial in Ge did not induce any charge state transition levels, with the neutral charge state stable for all Fermi energies in the band gap. Tm 3 + defects in Ge formed with formation energies between 1. 81 and 5. 31 eV for the neutral charge state. Of all the Tm 3 + related defects in Ge studied, the Tm 3 + i in the tetrahedral con guration formed with the lowest formation energy of 1. 81 eV. Tm 3 + i induced a <b>shallow</b> <b>donor</b> <b>level,</b> while Tm 3 + Ge and Tm 3 + i -VGe induced both acceptor and donor levels that were deep and shallow. Tm 3 + substitutional and vacancy complex (Tm 3 + Ge-VGe) in Ge exhibited charge state controlled metastability and negative-U ordering. The role of the di-interstitial, vacancy related defects, substitutional impurities and vacancy-interstitial complexes in Ge were pointed out and it is expected that the data and information presented will be useful in the process modelling of Ge-based devices for industrial, laboratory applications and for comparison to experimental results.

The results {{indicate}} that the enhanced photocurrent is mainly contributed by UV response due to electrical conductivity modification. Reductive doping gives rise to a pronounced enhancement in full UV region (300 to 400 nm) with a maximum value of 82 % at 360 nm. The decrease at shorter wavelengths could be attributed to the unwanted light reflection or absorption before arriving to a photoanode[29]. In the longer wavelength region, IPCE plots represent abrupt decreases from approximately 49 % (ATO) and approximately 74 % (ATO-H- 10) at 370 nm to less than 2 % at 410 nm, which is determined by the recombination of charge carriers in the wide bandgap (approximately 3.2 eV) anatase TiO 2 [30]. A weak photoactivity of pristine ATO nanotube in 400 to 600 nm could be ascribed to fluorine doping during anodization in NH 4 F-containing electrolytes[9, 31]. In addition, a slightly enhanced photocurrent can also be observed in the visible range (410 to 600 nm) on ATO-H- 10 electrode (inset of Figure  3 c). The oxygen vacancy states are generally localized with energies of 0.75 to 1.18 eV below the conduction band, which is lower than the redox potential for hydrogen evolution[32, 33], while a high vacancy concentration could produce <b>shallow</b> <b>donor</b> <b>levels</b> just below the conduction band, which in turn provides enough energy for water splitting[34].

In addition, it was found that the overall photoluminescence intensity is decreased at the Cu 2 + concentration of 2 %. The concentration quenching of the luminescence may be caused by the formation of CuS compound. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to explore the structural, electrical, mag-netic and optical properties of titanium based novel oxide thin films, such as trans-parent conducting oxides (TCOs) and diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs), {{so as to be}} able to realize optoelectronics and spintronics applications. I demonstrated that niobium doped titanium dioxide (TiO 2) in its epitax-ial anatase phase grown at certain condition is an intrinsic transparent conducting oxide, with both its conductivity and transparency comparable to that of the com-mercial transparent electrode In-Sn-O being widely used in current optoelectronic devices. I investigated the growth parameter dependence of structure and conductivity of this material. It was found that the growth temperature is a crucial parameter for the structural quality as well as the electron mobility, while the oxygen par-tial pressure is essential for the conduction electron concentration. The excellent conductivity of niobium doped TiO 2 should be attributed to the extremely high sol-ubility of niobium in the TiO 2 matrix as well as a very <b>shallow</b> <b>donor</b> <b>level</b> create...|$|E
40|$|With Sb-doped ZnO films {{deposited}} on glass substrates by RF reactive magnetron sputtering, the optical band gap of films increases {{with the increasing}} of oxygen concentration before anneal and decreases after anneal in nitrogenthe. The films show good transmissivity in the visible-near infrared. X-ray diffraction {{results indicate that the}} Sb-doped ZnO films grow along the ZnO(002) direction and have highly C-axis preferred orientation after anneal in nitrogenthe 550 ℃. No manganese oxide or nitride phase are detected after annealing in nitrogenthe 550 ℃ later. The strong blue emission peaks are observed at room temperature photoluminescence spectra of films and the luminescence mechanism of the blue is also discussed. The blue light emission(about 487 nm) is related to Zni(zinc interstice), VZn (zinc vacancy) defect levels and the corresponding blue light center which the Sb 3 + ions provides with; The blue light peak (about 436 nm) is related to Zni(zinc interstice) defect levels and the <b>shallow</b> <b>donor</b> <b>level</b> which VO (oxygen vacancy) forms in the Sb-doped ZnO films. The emergence of Blu-ray peaks have great significance {{for the development of a}} monochromatic blue light-emitting devices...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive impedance spectroscopy {{comparison of the}} AC properties of dense stoichiometric TiO 2 and conductive TinO 2 n − 1 Magnéli phases over a broad temperature range (up to 1000 °C for TiO 2 and 375 °C for TinO 2 n − 1). The frequency dependent conductivity and permittivity of both materials is {{explained in terms of}} “universal” power law behaviour. A deviation from the law, with a giant relative permittivity which is largely independent of frequency from 0. 1 Hz to 100 – 200 kHz is observed in the case of TinO 2 n − 1, due to the presence of residual TiO 2 generating an Internal Barrier Layer Capacitor (IBLC) effect. The real–imaginary impedance plots are interpreted using an RC model and allow separation of the contribution of the grain bulk and the grain boundaries to the total resistivity of the material. In the case of the TinO 2 n − 1 based materials this confirms that the IBLC effect is generated by insulating grain boundaries. The conduction mechanism in both TiO 2 and TinO 2 n − 1 appears to be dominated by electronic conductivities, activated mainly through <b>shallow</b> <b>donor</b> <b>levels</b> up to 200 °C and over the entire band gap, which is narrower for TinO 2 n − 1, above 200 °C. A deeper understanding of the AC properties of Magnéli phases of Ti at different temperatures aids in the optimisation of electrical properties for a variety of sensor and electrical applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrogen}} interstitial and the substitutional Al_Zn, Ga_Zn and In_Zn are all <b>shallow</b> <b>donors</b> in ZnO {{and lead}} to n-type conductivity. Although <b>shallow</b> <b>donors</b> are expected to repel each other, we show {{by first principles calculations}} that in ZnO these <b>shallow</b> <b>donor</b> impurities attract and form a complex, leading to a <b>donor</b> <b>level</b> deep in the band gap.

40|$|ASnO 3 (A=Ba, Sr) {{are unique}} {{perovskite}} oxides {{in that they}} have superior electron conductivity despite their wide optical band gaps. Using first-principles band structure calculations, we show that the small electron effective masses, thus, good electron conductivity of ASnO 3 {{can be attributed to}} the large size of Sn in this system that gives the conduction band edge with antibonding Sn and O s characters. Moreover, we show that ASnO 3 can be easily doped by La with <b>shallow</b> LaA(+/ 0) <b>donor</b> <b>level.</b> Our results, therefore, explained why the perovskite BaSnO 3, SrSnO 3, and their alloys are promising candidates for transparent conducting oxides.
