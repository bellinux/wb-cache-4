The present work {{deals with the}} computational analysis of flow (CFD analysis) and heat transfer with pin fin. In the present work a diamond <b>shaped</b> <b>pin</b> fin are used and is investigated under constant heat flux condition at the place of plane fin or elliptical pin fin.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This research {{presents the results}} of a combined numerical and experimental study of heat transfer and pressure drop behavior in a compact heat exchanger (CHE) designed with drop-shaped pin fins. A numerical study using ANSYS was first conducted to select the optimum <b>pin</b> <b>shape</b> and configuration for the CHE. This was followed by an experimental study to validate the numerical model. The results indicate that the drop <b>shaped</b> <b>pin</b> fins yield a considerable improvement in heat transfer compared to circular pin fins for the same pressure drop characteristics. This improvement is mainly due to the increased wetted surface area of the drop pins, and the delay in the flow separation as it passes the more streamlined drop <b>shaped</b> <b>pin</b> fins. The data and conclusions of this study can be used in heat exchanger design for large heat flux cooling applications as in gas turbine blades, and high-power electronics.

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} is aimed to {{determine}} the effect of friction stir welding pin; square and diamond shape on mechanical properties of butt joint AA 6061 weldment. Welding was carried out at different plunge depths of 0. 0, 0. 2, 0. 3 and 0. 4 mm together with rotation and transverse speeds of 500 rpm and 40 mm/min, respectively. Material flow, tensile strength and hardness of the weldment were evaluated. The results indicated that joint properties were significantly affected by tool design. It was found that material flow was higher for diamond pin tool compared to that of square pin resulting in considerable increased in tensile strength of the joint. In addition, the highest tensile strength was obtained on the samples welded with square <b>shape</b> <b>pin</b> at 0. 4 mm plunge depth whilst the lowest was by diamond shape at the plunge depth of 0. 0 mm.

The case of bifurcated type <b>shape</b> memory alloy <b>pins</b> inserted inside the composite strip around the hole to reinforce the laminate, which was subjected to the axial stress was simulated. The models for stress analysis were established by using ANSYS finite element programme. Two types of <b>shape</b> memory alloy <b>pins</b> were proposed to insert along the through thickness direction of the carbon fibre woven fabric composite strip to induce the clamping force. The pre-tensioned load {{was applied to the}} <b>shape</b> memory alloy <b>pins</b> in order to reduce occurrence of delamination in the laminate. Three-dimensional elements and contact elements were used to simulate the contact between the composite laminate and <b>shape</b> memory alloy <b>pin</b> to investigate the stress distribution around the hole in the composite strip. The effect of pre-strain of shape memory alloy on the stresses inside composite was studied. The results show that the stress characteristics of the button-shaped and bifurcated <b>shape</b> memory alloy <b>pin</b> models are similar; however, the stresses for the button-shaped pin model are lower. The tensile and compressive stresses, both in button-shaped and bifurcated pin models, are strongly dependent on the percentage of pre-strain of the shape memory alloy. It is therefore concluded that the <b>shape</b> memory alloy <b>pin</b> method was significantly reduced the stress concentration of the composite strip laminate.

The heads were located into an ad hoc Frame system based on anatomical measures and CT images, producted by Renishaw plc partner in this project. The frame was adapted and every components were checked for the ex vivo validation tests. CT imaging was taken in Lodi at Università degli studi di Milano, Facoltà di Medicina Veterinaria, with CT scanner and MRI imaging was taken in La Cittadina, Cremona Results System validation was approved by the ex vivo trial. The frame system doesn’t compromise the imaging acquisition in MRI and CT systems. Every system components are functional to their aims. Discussion The Frame system is adapted to the sheep head. It is composed by elements able to lock the head during the imaging acquisition. Frame system is characterized by a support base helpings the animals to keep the head straight forward during imaging time, under general anesthesia.
