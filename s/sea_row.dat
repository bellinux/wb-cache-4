60|$|Harris is more {{accustomed}} to <b>sea</b> <b>rowing</b> than to river work, and says that, as an exercise, he prefers it. I don’t. I remember taking a small boat out at Eastbourne last summer: I used {{to do a good}} deal of <b>sea</b> <b>rowing</b> years ago, and I thought I should be all right; but I found I had forgotten the art entirely. When one scull was deep down underneath the water, the other would be flourishing wildly about in the air. To get a grip of the water with {{both at the same time}} I had to stand up. The parade was crowded with nobility and gentry, and I had to pull past them in this ridiculous fashion. I landed half-way down the beach, and secured the services of an old boatman to take me back.|$|R

5000|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the tourist boom, Cala Bona was a village in a small natural harbour between Cap d'es Pinar and the peninsula of Punta de n'Amer. At that time the village only consisted of a pair of houses where a few families lived by fishing. The fishermen worked on the harbour and at <b>sea,</b> <b>rowing</b> and sailing their llaüts (small traditional Catalan wooden boats) to the surrounding rocky promontories, following the breeding lobsters. In 1924 the first guest house opened, a place called [...] "Cap Cupe" [...] which later became the [...] "Hotel Cala Bona".|$|R

50|$|At the Annual Dinner of 1870 Cutler, the Captain of the Club {{referred}} to having two heavy Punts of unequal size and that racing was hardly practical {{even with a}} handicap. Sir Henry Drummond Wolff {{who was then the}} Parliamentary candidate for Christchurch and Bournemouth presented the club with a four oared racing galley called the Lothair, which was the title of a novel by the Earl of Beaconsfield. This gift set an example, followed for many years by the Parliamentary candidate, to present a racing galley to the local club. These boats were usually built by Picket or some other expert at Southampton, and though quite light, were designed for <b>sea</b> <b>rowing</b> and so much stouter than 'fine' boats used at river Regattas such as the Henley Royal Regatta.|$|R

5000|$|The 2012 Celtic Challenge {{began at}} 4:00pm on Saturday, May 5th 2012. Conditions were rough {{throughout}} {{the first night}} and of the 23 crews who entered the event, only 12 completed the crossing, with several teams being forced to retire from the race. The majority of the withdrawals were due to multiple sea sicknesses, whilst other crews pulled out due to issues with support boats, one case of a lost tiller and one punctured RIB (Rigid-hulled inflatable boat). The first team to cross the finish line in Aberystwyth were the Aberdyfi men's team, {{with a time of}} 17 hours, 50 minutes and 4 seconds. The first Mixed team to finish were Foyle RC of Moville, Co. Donegal, Ireland. The first (and indeed, only) ladies' team to complete the challenge were Arklow Ladies. Despite the harsh sea and wind conditions, an all novice crew from Shropshire successfully completed the crossing in just shy of 26 hours. General consensus amongst the Welsh and Irish <b>sea</b> <b>rowing</b> community was that the 2012 Celtic Challenge was the most difficult so far, with a member of the winning team from Aberdyfi describing the experience as [...] "like rowing uphill through concrete".|$|R

5000|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} Verrazzano's demise. In one version, in 1528, during his third voyage to North America and after exploring Florida, the Bahamas, and the Lesser Antilles, Verrazzano anchored out to <b>sea</b> and <b>rowed</b> ashore, {{probably on the}} island of Guadeloupe. He was killed and eaten by the native Carib inhabitants. [...] The fleet of two or three ships was anchored out of gunshot range, and no one could respond in time. Other sources suggest that Verrazzano was executed for piracy by the Spanish, at Puerto del Pico, Spain.|$|R
60|$|I was abashed {{how to find}} {{expression}} for my thanks; but she was no less abashed {{at the thought of}} hearing them; begged us to lose no time and to hold our peace, saying (very properly) that the heart of our matter was in haste and silence; and so, what with one thing and another, she had set us on the Lothian shore not far from Carriden, had shaken hands with us, and was out again at <b>sea</b> and <b>rowing</b> for Limekilns, before there was one word said either of her service or our gratitude.|$|R

Perold-trellised <b>rows</b> were planted in a north-west to south-east direction primarily to minimise wind damage.|$|R
50|$|In January 2007, {{thirty years}} after the first man-powered {{crossing}} of the Tasman <b>Sea</b> by <b>row</b> boat, Andrew McAuley set out on his quest to become the first person to kayak from Australia to New Zealand to cross 1600 km {{of one of the most}} dangerous oceans on Earth - the Southern Ocean stretch of the Tasman Sea. After a month at sea, Andrew had endured all the difficulties and a three-day Category 9 storm. On 9 February, New Zealand maritime authorities received his distress call but they could not save his life. His body has never been recovered.|$|R

50|$|The second {{attempt by}} the Russians took {{advantage}} of the calm weather on the morning of 26 July, the day of Saint Pantaleon. The small galleys were easily maneuvered, whereas it was exceedingly difficult to try to turn the heavy Swedish battleships in such a weather. Apraksin initially sent 20 small galleys which succeeded in running the blockade and then as Swedes started towing their sailing ships further out to <b>sea</b> with <b>rowing</b> boats he sent 15 further galleys to the same route though the second group had to go much further around since Swedes had moved away from the immediate vicinity of the coast.|$|R
