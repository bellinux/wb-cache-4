50|$|Bubbly is {{a social}} voice service working across feature phones and {{smartphone}}s. For feature phones, users can record their voice by <b>dialling</b> a <b>short</b> <b>code</b> and speaking, as well as listen to popular posts. Subscribers get a text with the <b>short</b> <b>code</b> number for <b>dialling</b> into Bubbly’s servers to have the voice message play back. To cater to smartphone users, Bubbly was made available on iOS and Android platforms in April 2012.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} {{intervention is}} the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) multicultural health intervention service. The USSD is a protocol used by cellular phones {{to communicate with}} a telecommunication service provider. A USSD application has a unique <b>short</b> <b>code</b> {{in the form of}} *specific numbers# (e.g. * 128 #) or *specific numbers*specific numbers# (e.g. * 121 * 2 #). These <b>short</b> <b>codes</b> are <b>dialed</b> and sent to the service provider’s server using a phone. In response, the phone receives a message or a menu linked to different messages (from the server). Harnessing this two-way communication technology, the proposed intervention would allow culturally and linguistically diverse groups in the country to <b>dial</b> specific USSD <b>codes</b> on their phones, receive a menu of pertinent health information in response, and access (read) any information needed, in understood language options.|$|R
50|$|Originally Prestel IRC {{computers}} were directly dialled {{by means of}} an ordinary telephone number (e.g., the Enterprise computer in Croydon was accessed by dialling 01 686 0311. By 1984, the special <b>short</b> <b>dialling</b> <b>codes</b> 618 and 918 were in use in order to give access to the nearest IRC at local telephone call rates, at least across most parts of the UK.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the {{telephone}} network was that, in most cases, direct distance dialing for long-distance calls was not possible. Although area codes were assigned to all major towns and cities, they were only used for switching international calls. Instead, each location had its own list of <b>dialing</b> <b>codes</b> with <b>shorter</b> <b>codes</b> for local calls and longer codes for long-distance calls. After unification, the existing network was largely replaced, and area <b>codes</b> and <b>dialing</b> became standardised.|$|R
50|$|A mobile <b>dial</b> <b>code</b> {{combines}} a toll-free number, a web address and a <b>short</b> <b>code</b> into one simplified number. It is a 1-15 digit string of letters or numbers that is {{preceded by a}} combination of * or #.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} {{appear to have}} been {{originally}} three-digit <b>codes,</b> <b>dialled</b> without the leading area code, and the format of destination numbers dialled to the international senders has changed at various points as ability to call additional nations was added.|$|R
50|$|In {{industry}} jargon, these area {{codes and}} prefixes {{are referred to}} as NDC <b>codes</b> (National <b>Dialing</b> <b>Codes).</b> This is the term used by ComReg and technical documents, as they include non-geographic codes. Historically, like the UK, the term STD <b>code</b> (Subscriber Trunk <b>Dialling)</b> was used.However, the terminology is archaic and is no longer universally understood and should not be used to avoid confusion.|$|R

50|$|This {{is a list}} of <b>dialing</b> <b>codes</b> in Greece. The {{first digit}} {{represents}} type of service. 1 is used for <b>short</b> <b>codes,</b> 2 for geographical numbers (3 and 4 are reserved for that purpose too), 5 is used for inter-network routing purposes (non-dialable codes) and VPNs, 6 for mobile services, 7 is reserved for universal access numbers (not active), 8 for reduced-fee services (like 800 toll-free, 801 local call, 89 dial-up and data services), 9 is used for premium rate services (901 for general purpose and 909 for adult-only services). All dialable numbers are ten digits, except for <b>short</b> <b>codes</b> (3-5 digits in the 1 range), 807-XXXX (seven digits) used for calling card access codes, and numbers in the 5 range, used for routing purposes and not dialable by end-subscribers.|$|R

50|$|After {{the breakup}} of Yugoslavia, with <b>dialing</b> <b>code</b> 38, Kosovo used the Serbian <b>dialing</b> <b>code,</b> 381 for new and {{existing}} landlines. As mobile networks were introduced, PTK adopted the code 377 (Monaco) and IPKO adopted the code 386 (Slovenia). This situation resulted in the highly unusual simultaneous use of three international <b>dialing</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R

50|$|Area <b>code</b> <b>dialing</b> is {{optional}} in most geographical area codes, except Moscow (area codes 495, 498, 499); it is mandatory for non-geographical area codes. E.123 international and Microsoft formats {{are used for}} writing local phone numbers as well; international prefix and country code +7 are replaced with trunk code 8 (or 8~CC) when dialing a mandatory area code.|$|R
50|$|Boshiamy {{provides}} a special input mode for users to master these <b>short</b> <b>codes.</b> In this mode, users can only input a character by its <b>shortest</b> <b>code,</b> otherwise {{it does not}} output the character, but instead shows users the character alongside its <b>shortest</b> <b>code.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Latvia: In Latvia <b>short</b> <b>codes</b> {{also have}} no fixed length, {{starting}} from three digits up to five.

5000|$|Canada: Canadian Common <b>Short</b> <b>Codes</b> can be {{five or six}} digits long. Common <b>Short</b> <b>Codes</b> {{beginning}} with a leading '4' are reserved for private use by wireless network operators. Four-digit Common <b>Short</b> <b>Codes</b> are not permitted due to handset incompatibilities. Short code-based messages vary between zero-rated (paid for by campaign), standard rate (user is responsible for standard carrier charges), and premium rate (varies, C$1-10). Canadian <b>Short</b> <b>codes</b> are governed by the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association.|$|R
50|$|SMS {{marketing}} services typically run off a <b>short</b> <b>code,</b> but sending text messages to an {{email address is}} another methodology (though this method is {{not supported by the}} carriers). <b>Short</b> <b>codes</b> are 5 or 6 digit numbers that have been assigned by all the mobile operators in a given country especially for the use of brand campaign and other consumer services. Due to the high price of <b>short</b> <b>codes</b> of $500-$1000 a month, many small businesses opt to share a <b>short</b> <b>code</b> in order to reduce monthly costs. The mobile operators vet every <b>short</b> <b>code</b> application before provisioning and monitor the service to make sure it does not diverge from its original service description. Another alternative to sending messages by <b>short</b> <b>code</b> or email is to do so through one's own dedicated phone number.|$|R

[...] Codes starting with 1 are not permitted. Common <b>short</b> <b>codes</b> in the U.S. are leased by the program's registry service provider iconectiv, under a deal with the Common <b>Short</b> <b>Code</b> Administration and CTIA. <b>Short</b> <b>codes</b> are leased at a price, with a selected code costing twice that of a random code. Some carriers assign a subset of their carrier-specific codes to third parties.|$|R
