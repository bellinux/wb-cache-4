50|$|In 1971, {{the state}} {{government}} of Sabah under Mustapha Harun submitted an enactment recognising Malaysian language as the state's official language. Following the amendments of 1973 Constitution, the use of English language has been restricted to only for official purposes with {{the extension of the}} 1967 Malaysian National Language Act. As a result of the domination of Malaysian language into the state, the proficiency over English language among younger Sabahan generations have been gradually decreasing. The largest indigenous language of Kadazan Dusun has also become an endangered language as the language have not been made a compulsory language in the state schools. Due to the tight Malay culture and language policies over national schools, many Sabahan bumiputera parents have preferred {{to send their children to}} Chinese schools of which based on a survey in 2010 revealed there is around 12,138 Sabahan bumiputera students enrolled in Chinese national type primary schools and preschools, becoming the second state after Sarawak with the highest number of bumiputera pupils enrolment in Chinese schools. In addition with the perception among non-Chinese parents that Chinese schools provide a better quality education and were more disciplined along with the rise of China as a new global economic powers that forced the need to mastered Chinese languages. Since 2014, the British Council have actively giving assistance to teach English in primary schools followed by Fulbright Program from the United States in 2015 to teaching English in secondary schools. Kadazan Dusun language also started to be promoted at the same time, with the language teacher will complete their training in 2018 and <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> in 2019. Starting from 2016, the Sabah Education Department has set Tuesday as an English Day for schools to return the English proficiency in the state and all younger generations have been urged to converse more in English.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} pre-service teachers ’ concerns about working in remote areas before they enter teaching profession, and their real life experiences when they <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> in remote areas in Turkey. Sixteen pre-service teachers were interviewed immediately after their graduation. Then, six teachers started to teach in remote areas. Two more interviews were conducted with six beginning teachers when they finish first and second semester they taught. The phenomenological analysis developed by Moustakas (1994) was used in this study. Findings of this study revealed that pre-service teachers were reluctant to work in remote areas due to social, economical, cultural, and safety problems. When they <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> in those regions they realized that actual situation is far worse than their initial expectations. They especially struggled to teach children coming from low socioeconomic status and children who did not speak Turkish. Involving low SES parents into their children’s education and lack of social life in a small and closed society were also challenging for beginning teachers...|$|E

The starting point for our experiment {{was the fact that}} we realized that most of the students in our faculties still start their design with pen and paper. Although they introduce the computer quite early in the design process now their first design ideas were mainly visualized in sketches.

New notions gradually appeared within the frame of the School Educational Programs creation, for example: key competences, the disposable time dotation or sectional themes. The content of these notions was realized at schools in principal in former times. In the new School Educational Programmes the content should be exactly defined and delimitated in context of the school specialization and organizational possibilities. Now the schools should have an idea, how the School Educational Programme and its parts will be realized during the school year. It is also related to the sectional themes. How will be the sectional themes realized at schools? What are {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different ways of the realization? What position does geography occupy in the particular sectional themes? Thes are only a few questions, which should be answered in the following article...|$|E

The basic problem faced by educator is there are many student that always moaned when their teacher <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> Math. By this problem, educator a is expected to take the best way to encourage their young learner to learn Math and create an interactive and attractive classroom. People are now living in the information age. Information technology, especially computer technology are becoming increasingly. Using computer and educational game as a tool in teaching learning process will give a new experience for young children. Basically, children will be more interesting in learning with something challenging and attracting. The purpose of this research is to determine whether there is an influence on students’ evaluation between teaching learning process using paper and educational game as an instructional media. In doing this research, the writers give two kinds of test to the student to collect the data. From the data collected can be seen that there is no significant differences between those two method...|$|E
40|$|As {{we begin}} a new {{academic}} year, {{many of us are}} introducing another generation of students to the magic of calculus. As always, those of us who teach calculus are asking ourselves again, “What {{is the best way to}} begin calculus? ” More specifically, “How do we <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> students what a derivative is? ” Some of us will start with slopes and others choose limits. Among those who begin with limits, some will use epsilons and deltas and others will use a more intuitive approach to the algebra of limits. A few might use non-standard analysis, as rigorously presented in the wonderful book [K] by Jerome Kiesler. Newton began with “fluxions, ” while Leibniz used differentials and a “differential triangle. ” Regular readers of this column, though, know to ask “How did Euler do it?” Almost as soon as it was invented (or, if you prefer, discovered) people began arguing about its foundations. Leibniz looked for an algebraic basis for calculus, while Newton argued in favor of geometric foundations. The controversy continued for more than a hundred years, with key contributions from Berkeley and Lagrange, until most of the issues were finally resolved in the time of Cauchy, Riemann and Weierstrass. Euler published his differential calculus book, Institutiones calculi differentialis, [E 212]...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates verb {{errors in}} {{compositions}} written by 16 -year-old learners of English in Sweden. The investigation consists of 44 essays which are {{randomly selected from}} the National Assessment Programme, National test in 2003 for year nine. The aims of the study are first, to investigate what types of errors the students make regarding time and tense and second, to compare the types of errors with the results found from 1995 in To Err Is Human (Köhlmyr, 2003). An analysis of the results shows that the students make {{the same types of}} errors as they made in 1995. From a pedagogical point of view, the most alarming results that were found in the study were first, the incorrect use of the progressive form and second, the incorrect use of gonna. As I see it, this study is highly interesting for all people who work in school, since conclusions drawn from the results indicate that there is a huge lack in students’ knowledge in how to express time and tense correctly. I mean that after having read this study, one will understand that the school must <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> grammar explicitly so that the students will be given a chance to use the language in a correct way in their communication...|$|E

40|$|Foundation phase {{teachers}} are {{the beginning and}} the foundation of it all. Teachers of foundation phase should be commended for being eye openers. They start learners from scratch and teach them the basics of reading. But research has shown that most foundation phase {{teachers are}} uncertain about the methods and approaches that they need to use in order to teach reading to the beginners at schools. Admittedly, some teachers have developed methods of their own that are far superior to any that have been investigated and commercially published. It is therefore imperative to understand the different ways that teachers employ to engage children when they <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> them reading and how they help them gain literacy as {{the first step in the}} empowerment of the mind. This study is qualitative in nature and it examines methods used by foundation phase teachers in teaching the grade ones reading Setswana. Data for this paper was collected data from 8 different foundation phase schools in Bojanala District at Brits which falls under the Department of Basic Education (DBE). In this study, four foundation phase teachers were observed and subsequently interviewed on the methods that they use when they teaching Setswana to the foundation phase learners. The teaching of Setswana involved teaching the learners to read. While they are four teachers observed, this paper will, however, focus on two teachers only. In the end it was clear that more cooperation and collaboration between teachers and local circuit and district administrators in planning and delivering teaching approaches and the workshops.
