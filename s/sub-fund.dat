This study evaluated the effectiveness of a group parenting intervention designed to strengthen the home learning environment of children from disadvantaged families. Two cluster randomised controlled superiority trials were conducted in parallel and delivered within existing services: a 6 -week parenting group (51 locations randomised; 986 parents) for parents of infants (aged 6 - 12  months), and a 10 -week facilitated playgroup (58 locations randomised; 1200 parents) for parents of toddlers (aged 12 - 36  months). Each trial had three conditions: intervention (smalltalk group-only); enhanced intervention with home coaching (smalltalk plus); and 'standard'/usual practice controls. Parent-report and observational measures were collected at baseline, 12 and 32  weeks follow-up. Primary outcomes were parent verbal responsivity and home learning activities at 32  weeks. In the infant trial, there were no differences by trial arm for the primary outcomes at 32  weeks. In the toddler trial at 32 -weeks, participants in the smalltalk group-only trial showed improvement compared to the standard program for parent verbal responsivity (effect size (ES) [*]=[*] 0. 16; 95 % CI 0. 01, 0. 36) and home learning activities (ES[*]=[*] 0. 17; 95 % CI 0. 01, 0. 38) but smalltalk plus did not. For the secondary outcomes in the infant trial, several initial differences favouring smalltalk plus were evident at 12  weeks, but not maintained to 32  weeks. For the toddler trial, differences in secondary outcomes favouring smalltalk plus were evident at 12  weeks and maintained to 32  weeks. These trials provide some evidence of the benefits of a parenting intervention focused on the home learning environment for parents of toddlers but not infants.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the restructuring of}} the pension funds of Transnet, a South African state-owned company involved in transportation, from the 1990 s. Two of its main pension funds, the Transport-Transnet Pension <b>sub-Fund</b> (TTPF) and the Transnet Second Defined Benefit Fund (TSDBF), have been surrounded by controversy, with major court actions brought by aggrieved pensioners in 2006 - 2012 and again from 2013, and smaller cases in 1997 - 1999 and 2004. (There were also a number of smaller cases, mostly unsuccessful, but the thesis will not examine them). The case that started in 2013 is the biggest class action in the country‟s history, and makes claims of serious mismanagement and bad faith against the Transnet management. But the fundamental grievance is that (according to the 2013 legal case) “more than 80 % of pensioners earn less than R 4 000. 00 a month… 62 % earn less than R 2 500. 00 … 45 % of the pensioners earn less than the state‟s ordinary old-age pension” grant for the poor. Although that case is ongoing, this thesis {{examines the}} background and controversies that frame the case. It {{provides an overview of}} the history and development of the South African pensions system and South African state-owned companies; it examines how these have been shaped by the apartheid and post-apartheid periods, and by the rise of neo-liberalism; it examines the evolution of Transnet and its pensions systems, from {{the early days of the}} South African Railways and Harbours Administration (SAR&H, formed 1910), to its restructuring into the South African Transport Services (SATS) in 1982, and then into Transnet in 1990. The thesis shows that the operations of the TTPF and TSDBF, which are closed to new members, have had serious effects on pensioners that rely upon them. Pensions are very low (the main reason for the various court cases), and this is for a range of reasons. Annual increases in pensions are formally set at below-inflation levels, leading to falling real incomes. More pressure on pensioners‟ livelihoods has arisen from Transnet‟s cuts to other benefits, like the medical aid Transmed, provided to pensioners. While the schemes are solvent, the pensions generally started at a low base, partly because most pensioners were relatively poorly paid workers before retirement (and the pensions were linked to former salaries). There is also a racial dimension: while most white workers at SAR&H/ SATS and Transnet were poorly paid, black, Coloured and Indian workers were paid even worse, and, further, were only brought into the pension schemes late. Both TTPF and TSDBF are defined benefit funds, which means members are guaranteed specific benefits at retirement, with the employer obligated to inject funds to meet shortfalls where needed. Yet neither the state nor Transnet has been willing to take actions to lift the basic pensions, such as investments into the funds, or to make systematic ex gratia payments to bring the pensions to a reasonable level, to remove historic racial inequalities between pensioners, to increase medical aid co-payments or coverage or to otherwise address the pensioners‟ situation. It does not seem that the reason for the problems is that the two funds have been severely mismanaged or asset-stripped, as alleged in the 2013 class action: it must be noted that both funds report surpluses. But the surpluses are possible because the pensions are low and falling in real terms, and the numbers of pensioners declining due to deaths. It seems clear that Transnet is unable or unwilling to act to decisively improve the situation of the pensioners: ensuring a surplus on existing pension funds is a major goal. This is partly because Transnet itself has ongoing financial problems, and partly because it operates in the context of neo-liberal restructuring, like corporatisation, commercialisation and privatisation, which places limits on the additional funding of the funds. At the same time, the pensioners have very little real, as opposed to a nominal, say in the administration of the pension schemes, limiting their ability to affect the rules and administration or raise issues. The thesis seeks to use historical institutionalism, which sees policies and major institutions, including state-owned companies, as shaped by power and conflict, especially between classes. This is used to try and explain changing state policies and the changing role and actions of state-owned companies, as a way of understanding Transnet‟s actions, as well as its treatment of its pensioners...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyze {{investment}} fund market in Luxembourg in respect of legal, regulatory and quantitative aspects and identify reasons of its expansion in last years. Luxembourg in nowadays largest investment fund market in Europe - net asset value invested in almost 10 000 undertakings for collective investment - UCIs (including <b>sub-funds</b> of umbrella funds) registered in Grand-Duchy amounts about 2 trillion euros, which represents 1 / 4 of European investment fund market. Luxembourg is not only Europe's most important centre of financial and investment fund services, but also world's leading hub for global fund distribution - about 3 / 4 true cross-border fund registrations in the world concern Luxembourg funds. Competitive advantage of being the first country to offer investment funds according with the European passport for cross-border distribution (Luxembourg was the first EU member state to adapt its legislation to the European direcitives UCITS I and UCITS III), as well as constant modernization of the country's legal and fiscal environment attracted fund promoters from all around the world who offer wide range of investment products. These aspects as well as very stable political and social environment, concentration of specialist service providers, excellent infrastructure, multicultural and multilingual workforce were principal determinants of this leading position.

40|$|This paper investigates whether Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) {{is more or}} less {{sensitive}} to market downturns than conventional investment, and examines the legal implications for fund managers and trustees. Using a market model methodology, we find that over the past 15 years, the beta risk of SRI, both in Australia and internationally, increased more than that of conventional investment during economic downturns. This implies that companies acting as fund trustees, managed investment schemes and traditional institutional fund managers risk breaching their fiduciary or statutory duties if they go long - or remain long - in SRI funds during market downturns, unless perhaps relevant legislation is reformed. If reform is viewed as desirable, possible reforms could include explicitly overriding the common law to allow all traditional funds to invest in SRI; granting immunity to directors of trustee companies from potential personal liability under sections 197 or 588 G et seq of the Corporations Act; allowing companies acting as trustees, managed investment schemes and traditional institutional fund managers and trustees to invest in SRI without triggering a substantial capital gains tax liability through trust resettlement; tax concessions for SRI (eg. introducing a 150 % tax deduction or investment allowance for SRI); and allowing SRI <b>sub-funds</b> to obtain “deductible gift recipient” status or the equivalent from relevant taxation authorities. The research is important and original insofar as the assessment of risk in SRIs during market downturns is an area which has hitherto not been subjected to rigorous empirical investigation, despite its serious legal implications...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether socially responsible investment (SRI) is less sensitive to market downturns than conventional investments; the legal implications for fund managers and trustees; and possible legislative reforms to allow conventional funds more scope to invest in SRI. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the market model to estimate betas over the past 15 years for SRI funds and conventional investment funds during economic downturns, as distinct from during more "normal" (non-recessionary) economic times. Findings - The beta risk of SRI, both in Australia and internationally, increases more than that of conventional investment during economic downturns. Traditional fund managers and trustees in Australia are therefore likely to breach their fiduciary duties if they go long - or remain long - in SRI funds during economic downturns, unless relevant legislation is reformed. Research limitations/implications - The methodology assumes that alpha and beta in the market model are constant. Second, it categorises the state of the market into "normal" economic conditions and downturns using dummy variables. More sophisticated techniques could be used in future research. Practical implications - The current law would prevent conventional funds from investing in SRI. If SRI is viewed as socially desirable, useful legislative reforms could include explicitly overriding the common law to allow conventional funds to invest in SRI; introducing a 150 percent tax deduction or investment allowance for SRI; and allowing SRI <b>sub-funds</b> to obtain deductible gift recipient status from the Australian Tax Office and other taxation authorities. Originality/value - The accurate assessment of risk in SRIs is an area which, despite its serious legal implications, is yet to be subjected to rigorous empirical investigation.
