40|$|The flow {{structure}} around a circular cylinder with U-grooved surfaces {{has been investigated}} experimentally.

At Re(D) = 1. 4 × 10 ^ 5, the U-type grooves reduce the drag coefficient acting on <b>the</b> <b>cylinder</b> by 18. 6 %, compared with that <b>of</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>cylinder.</b> <b>The</b> flow characteristics <b>of</b> wake behind <b>the</b> U-grooved <b>cylinder</b> have been analyzed using two kinds of particle image velocimetry (PIV) velocity measurement techniques, cinematic PIV and high-resolution PIV. Consecutive instantaneous velocity fields were measured using the cinematic PIV technique at time interval of 5 ms, corresponding to about 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vortex shedding frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wake. The instantaneous velocity fields measured with the high-resolution PIV technique were ensemble-averaged to get <b>the</b> spatial distributions <b>of</b> turbulent statistics including turbulent intensities and turbulent kinetic energy.
