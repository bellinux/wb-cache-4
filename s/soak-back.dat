40|$|The Small Probes for Orbital Return of Experiments (SPORE) flight {{system is}} {{designed}} to perform atmospheric entry, descent and landing (EDL) in order to return small payloads from an Earth orbit to the ground for recovery and laboratory analysis. One such capability that the SPORE system will provide is in-situ flight test data of various Thermal Protection Systems (TPS), {{to be used for}} comparison to ground-based Arcjet test data and analyses. The following paper summarizes the current design of the SPORE TPS testbed mission and the various analyses and trade studies performed in order to converge on an entry system design. In particular, the driving EDL requirements are discussed as well as the nominal entry state (with dispersions) and trajectory design. An overall description of the entry vehicle packaging is included, with additional discussion of the parachute selection and deployment criteria. In addition, the entry vehicle thermal <b>soak-back</b> characterization is described as well as the re-entry stability analysis. The current mass budget for the entry system is included...|$|E
40|$|Under NASA sponsorship, Northrop Grumman Space Technology (NGST) designed, {{built and}} tested two non-toxic, {{reaction}} control engines, one using liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH 2) {{and the other}} using liquid oxygen and ethanol. This paper presents the design and testing of the LOX/LH 2 thruster. The two key enabling technologies are the coaxial liquid-on-liquid pintle injector and the fuelcooling duct. The workhorse thruster was hotfire tested at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center Test Stand 500 in March and April of 2002. All tests were performed at sea-level conditions. During the test program, 7 configurations were tested, including 2 combustion chambers, 3 LOX injector pintle tips, and 4 LHp injector settings. The operating conditions surveyed were 70 to 100 % thrust levels, mixture ratios from 3. 27 to 4. 29, and LH 2 duct cooling from 18. 0 to 25. 5 % fuel flow. The copper heat sink chamber was used for 16 burns, each burn lasting from 0. 4 to 10 seconds, totaling 51. 4 seconds, followed by Haynes chamber testing ranging from 0. 9 to 120 seconds, totaling 300. 9 seconds. The performance of the engine reached 95 % C* efficiency. The temperature on the Haynes chamber remained well below established material limits, {{with the exception of}} one localized hot spot. These results demonstrate that both the coaxial liquid-on-liquid pintle injector design and fuel duct concepts are viable for the intended application. The thruster headend design maintained cryogenic injection temperatures while firing, which validates the selected injector design approach for minimal heat <b>soak-back.</b> Also, off -nominal operation without adversely impacting the thermal response of the engine showed the robustness of the duct design, a key design feature for this application. By injecting fuel into the duct, the throat temperatures are manageable, yet the split of fuel through the cooling duct does not compromise the overall combstion efficiency, which indicates that, provided proper design refinement, such a concept could be applied to a high-performance version of the thruster...|$|E
