Technology <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> storage NVM has always been the strategy to achieve higher density NVM with lower cost per bit in order to meet the persistent consumer demand for larger storage space. However, conventional technology <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> storage NVM has run into many critical reliability challenges related to fundamental device characteristics. Therefore, further technology scaling has to be supplemented with novel approaches in order to surmount these reliability issues to achieve desired reliability performance. This paper is focused on reviewing critical research findings on major reliability challenges and technical solutions to mitigate technology <b>scaling</b> challenges <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> storage NVM. Most of these technical solutions are still in research phase while a few of them are more mature and ready for production phase. Three of the mature technical solutions will be reviewed in detail, that is, tunnel oxide top/bottom nitridation, nanocrystal, and phase change memory (PCM). Key advantages and reported reliability challenges of these approaches are thoroughly reviewed in this paper.

Bishops were there, suffering from fatty degeneration of the heart caused by too close application to study; ancient spinsters of good family subject to spasms; gouty retired generals. Can anybody tell me how many men in the British Army go to a general? Somebody once assured me it was five thousand, but that is absurd, on the face of it. The British Army, in that case, would have to be counted by millions. There are a goodish few American colonels still knocking about. The American colonel is still to be met with here and there by the curious traveller, but compared with the retired British general he is an extinct species. In Cheltenham and Brighton and other favoured towns there are streets of nothing but retired British generals--squares of retired British generals--whole crescents of British generals. Abroad there are pensions with a special <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> for British generals. In Switzerland there has even been talk of reserving railway compartments [...] "For British Generals Only." [...] In Germany, when you do not say distinctly and emphatically on being introduced that you are not a British general, you are assumed, as a matter of course, to be a British general. During the Boer War, when I was residing in a small garrison town on the Rhine, German military men would draw me aside and ask of me my own private personal views as to the conduct of the campaign. I would give them my views freely, explain to them how I would finish the whole thing in a week.|$|E

A theoretical study <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> transport in organic semiconductors was performed on self-assembled layers of [1]benzothieno[3, 2 -b]benzothiophene functionalized with alkyl side chains.

40|$|Land use {{planning}} often {{bears the}} brunt of industry complaints about rising costs of residential development and perceived consequences for housing unaffordability. The residential development industry, both in Australia and in the United States, has made strident protests about the direct and indirect {{costs associated with the}} planning process – from complying with building and design controls to the time taken to secure approval and contributions towards local infrastructure. Although there has been academic interest in the relationships between land use planning and the housing market, little attempt has been made to examine these industry claims by quantifying costs to housing development arising from planning regulations and related charges. This paper focuses on these issues, drawing on a study undertaken for the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (AHURI). The first part of the paper outlines the international literature on theoretical relationships between planning regulation, residential development costs and house prices. Secondly, Australian industry position papers on housing affordability and the planning system (2003 - 3008) are reviewed. Thirdly, the paper establishes the key categories of planning related costs to residential development in Australia, and compares the development contribution frameworks applying to three Australian cities (Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne).
