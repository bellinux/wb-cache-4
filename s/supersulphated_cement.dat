40|$|The product {{formed from}} intergrinding {{blastfurnace}} slag and hemihydrate gypsum {{is known as}} <b>supersulphated</b> <b>cement</b> (SSC) and this was widely used in foundation engineering until the advent of sulphate-resisting cements in the mid 20 th century. The use of SSC has declined in recent decades for economic reasons, yet it remains an eminently viable engineering material. A potential new use for sulphate activated pozzolans is to make Controlled Low Strength Materials which are low strength mortars and are used for waste containment, trench-fill and other general backfill applications. These materials are rapidly gaining market share from conventional products such as foamed concretes. Concretes for sub-bases for car parks and other hard standing are other potential uses. Gypsum is already permitted in EU standard prENI 14227 - 3 for road foundations containing ash. The work in this project is based on using gypsum which contains too many impurities {{to be used in}} plasterboard or cement production and mixing it with other waste materials such as basic oxygen slag from steel production and cement kiln dust. The main source of red gypsum for the project is titanium oxide pigment production which yields 250 kt of “red” gypsum per year in the UK. Worldwide production of red gypsum is 1. 25 Mt from one producer alone. Waste gypsum also arises from plasterboard off-cuts from construction sites and spent casting cores from foundries and very many areas of chemical manufacturing produce secondary gypsum from acid neutralisation. This presentation will describe the background to the research project which is being carried out by Coventry University, Imperial College London and Birmingham University. The results from testing these materials in the laboratory and a site trial will also be presented...|$|E
40|$|The work is {{studying}} posibilities of use secondary materials produced by energetical industry. In fact it studies posibilities of preparing <b>supersulphates</b> <b>cements</b> with secondary raw materials. Its main system for simulation was used milled portland clinker. To clinker were added diferent secondary raw materials from energetical industry with sulphate. On prepared samples were watched mechanical properties in time. Tested were different samples of secondary raw materials...|$|R
40|$|The hydration, {{strength}} {{development and}} composition of hydration products of <b>supersulphated</b> <b>cements</b> were characterized from the first 48 hours up to 360 days. Two compositions of 80 % Blast furnace slag, 10 – 15 % Fluorgypsum and 10 – 5 % Portland cement were cured in dry and wet conditions. The main hydration products were ettringite and C-S-H since the first hours and up to 360 days as evidenced by X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis and electron microscopy. The strength was favored by higher fluorgypsum contents and lower Portland cement contents. These cements generated heats of hydration of 40 – 57 KJ/Kg after 28 hours, which are lower than portland cement. Peer reviewe...|$|R
