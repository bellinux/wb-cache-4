40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the extent to}} which functional structure and spatial variability of intertidal communities coincide with major biogeographical boundaries, areas where extensive compositional changes in the biota are observed over a limited geographic extension. We then investigate whether spatial variation in the biomass of functional groups, over geographic (10 ′s km) and local (10 ′s m) scales, could be associated to species diversity within and among these groups. Functional community structure expressed as abundance (density, cover and biomass) and composition of major functional groups was quantified through field surveys at 20 rocky intertidal <b>shores</b> <b>spanning</b> six degrees of latitude along the southwest Atlantic coast of Argentina and extending across the boundaries between the Argentinean and Magellanic Provinces. Patterns of abundance of individual functional groups were not uniformly matched with biogeographical regions. Only ephemeral algae showed an abrupt geographical discontinuity coincident with changes in biogeographic boundaries, and this was limited to the mid intertidal zone. We identified 3 – 4 main ‘groups’ of sites in terms of the total and relative abundance of the major functional groups, but these did not coincide with biogeographical boundaries, nor did they follow latitudinal arrangement. Thus, processes that determine the functional structure of these intertidal communities are insensitive to biogeographical boundaries. Over both geographical and local spatial scales, and for most functional groups and tidal levels, increases in species richness within the functional group was significantly associated to increased total biomass and reduced spatial variability of the group. These results suggest that species belonging to the same functional group are sufficiently uncorrelated over space (i. e. metres and site-to-site) to stabilize patterns of biomass variability and, in this manner, provide a buffer, or “insurance”, against spatial variability in environmental conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|This study, part of {{a broader}} {{investigation}} of the history of exploitation of right whales, Balaena glacialis, in the western North Atlantic, emphasizes U. S. shore whaling from Maine to Delaware (from lat. 45 °N to 38 ° 30 'N) in the period 1620 – 1924. Our broader study of the entire catch history is intended to provide an empirical basis for assessing past distribution and abundance of this whale population. Shore whaling may have begun at Cape Cod, Mass., in the 1620 ’s or 1630 ’s; it was certainly underway there by 1668. Right whale catches in New England waters peaked before 1725, and shore whaling at Cape Cod, Martha’s Vineyard, and Nantucket continued to decline {{through the rest of the}} 18 th century. Right whales continued to be taken opportunistically in Massachusetts, however, until the early 20 th century. They were hunted in Narragansett Bay, R. I., as early as 1662, and desultory whaling continued in Rhode Island until at least 1828. Shore whaling in Connecticut may have begun in the middle 1600 ’s, continuing there until at least 1718. Long Island <b>shore</b> whaling <b>spanned</b> the period 1650 – 1924. From its Dutch origins in the 1630 ’s, a persistent shore whaling enterprise developed in Delaware Bay and along the New Jersey shore. Although this activity was most profi table in New Jersey in the early 1700 ’s, it continued there until at least the 1820 ’s. Whaling in all areas of the northeastern United States was seasonal, with most catches in the winter and spring. Historically, right whales appear to have been essentially absent from coastal waters south of Maine during the summer and autumn. Based on documented references to specific whale kills, about 750 – 950 right whales were taken between Maine and Delaware, from 1620 to 1924. Using production statistics in British customs records, the estimated total secured catch of right whales in New England, New York, and Pennsylvania between 1696 and 1734 was 3, 839 whales based on oil and 2, 049 based on baleen. After adjusting these totals for hunting loss (loss-rate correction factor = 1. 2), we estimate that 4, 607 (oil) or 2, 459 (baleen) right whales were removed from the stock in this region during the 38 -year period 1696 – 1734. A cumulative catch estimate of the stock’s size in 1724 is 1, 100 – 1, 200. Although recent evidence of occurrence and movements suggests that right whales continue to use their traditional migratory corridor along the U. S. east coast, the catch history indicates that this stock was much larger in the 1600 ’s and early 1700 ’s than it is today. Right whale hunting in the eastern United States ended by the early 1900 ’s, and the species has been protected throughout the North Atlantic since the mid 1930 ’s. Among the possible reasons for the relatively slow stock recovery are: the very small number of whales that survived the whaling era to become founders, a decline in environmental carrying capacity, and, especially in recent decades, mortality from ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Environmental {{stress can}} {{negatively}} affect {{the ability of}} organisms to reproduce. Energetic trade-offs exist in all organisms, and under stress, energy may be allocated away from reproduction and towards physiological defense and repair mechanisms. The rocky intertidal environment is ideal for investigating the influence of environmental stress, as organisms are exposed to both terrestrial and marine conditions due to tidal fluctuation. Aerial exposure at low tide can lead to high temperature, desiccation, and oxidative stress. Stress in the intertidal zone increases along a vertical gradient, as organisms in the high intertidal are exposed to air {{for longer periods of}} time than those in the low intertidal. Mussels are typically the dominant space-occupiers on temperate rocky <b>shores,</b> and they <b>span</b> the vertical gradient by occupying the entire mid-zone, from the low intertidal, which is a relatively low-stress environment, to the high intertidal, which is a high-stress environment. In this dissertation, we compared growth, reproduction, physiological defenses, pigmentation, and survival of mussels from the low-stress and high-stress regimes. We also compared energy allocation towards reproduction in mussels across a gradient of food availability between sites on the central Oregon coast. Findings indicate that growth and energy allocation towards reproduction are reduced in the high edge of the mussel bed, and physiological defenses are increased. A pattern was revealed where mussels in the high edge of the mussel bed are accumulating high concentrations of carotenoid pigments into their gonadal tissues, which was previously thought to be a secondary sex characteristic of females. This suggests that mussels may be incorporating carotenoids into their gonads in an effort to protect their gametes from damage by oxygen free radicals generated during aerial exposure. Results of this research have implications for intertidal systems under climate change scenarios, as extreme aerial temperature events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity, and changes in oceanic circulation may also occur. Based on the findings presented in this dissertation, increases in aerial temperature could potentially lead to decreased energy allocation towards reproduction, changes in spawning time, and reduced survival of adult mussels...|$|R

40|$|The rocky {{intertidal}} zone represents {{the interface between}} the marine and terrestrial environment and {{is considered one of}} the most thermally complex ecosystems on earth. Biologists have long understood that life within the {{intertidal zone}} is considerably influenced by a steep thermal gradient produced by the rising and falling tide. In recent years, however, studies have discovered that numerous small-scale processes, other than elevation in tidal height, can produce mosaic patterns of thermal stress along rocky intertidal shores. Linking this local temperature variability to the physiological and demographic patterns of intertidal invertebrates is an essential first step to understanding how climate change might be expected to influence these communities. The early life history stages of many rocky intertidal invertebrates are particularly vulnerable to heat and desiccation stress and play a key role in structuring adult populations. Therefore, temperature variability may considerably influence important demographic processes within intertidal populations. Nevertheless, temperature measurements are often taken at large spatial scales (10 to 1000 m 2) while early life history processes are typically measured at much smaller scales, such as at the quadrat-level (10 to 100 cm 2). Processes that operate at these different spatial scales may produce different patterns of temperature variability and consequently limit our ability to relate an organism’s physiological response to its environment and ultimately the demography of the population. Differences between body temperatures of sessile rocky intertidal invertebrates distributed across local spatial scales (100 m) may be substantially influenced by the density and species composition of the surrounding biotic community. By contrast, differences between body temperatures of sessile rocky intertidal invertebrates distributed across large spatial scales (100 to 1000 km) most likely reflect geographical variation in temperature. Yet, the characteristics of biotic communities have been shown to vary across both regional and large spatial scales. Thus, local-scale differences in the biotic community may counteract or negate temperature variability caused by larger-scale processes. Such might be the case along the south east coast of Australia where densities of dominant space occupiers vary with latitude. My thesis aimed to examine how large- and small-scale temperature variability influences the early life history processes of the habitat forming rocky intertidal barnacle Tesseropora rosea and to characterise the thermal environment at a range of scales. For the large-scale aspect of this study I investigated whether early life history processes could explain the decline in adult abundances along a latitudinal temperature gradient. I then assessed the common use of satellites and terrestrial weather stations as proxies of in situ rocky intertidal water and air temperatures, respectively. This was in order to determine the most appropriate method for measuring rocky intertidal temperature variability. Due to the high variability detected by loggers within a single shore, I next used infrared (IR) imagery to characterise fine-scale temperature variability relevant to recently settled larvae. By undertaking a series of manipulative experiments I investigated how this fine-scale temperature variability influences the settlement and early post-settlement growth and survival of T. rosea. The large-scale component of this study initially revealed that abundances of adult T. rosea decline with increasing latitude, suggesting that important demographic processes, such as settlement and early mortality (i. e. recruitment), may be particularly vulnerable to changes in sea surface temperatures. However, sampling across 11 rocky <b>shores</b> <b>spanning</b> 450 km over a two year period did not reveal any latitudinal gradients in either the production, settlement or early post-settlement mortality of larvae even though in situ temperature measurements confirmed the existence of a latitudinal temperature gradient. Indeed, settlement and adult mortality were highly variable among locations and the original decline in adult abundance observed during February 2007 was no longer present in December 2008. These results indicate that local variation in early life-history processes and adult mortality dictate regional variability and observed latitudinal patterns of adult T. rosea abundance. Such local variation in early life-history processes and adult mortality may reflect high temperature variability at these localscales. Therefore, local temperature variability may be an important factor governing biogeographic patterns of abundance. Large-scale settlement and recruitment studies commonly use remote sensing to characterise the thermal environment of recently settled larvae. The use of these temperature measurements have yet to be validated as useful surrogates of in situ temperature variability. Although I found that daily and monthly average temperatures derived from satellites and terrestrial weather stations were significantly correlated, the temperatures reported were considerably different from temperatures derived from in situ data loggers. Daily satellite sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were up to 6. 7 °C, and on average 1 °C, higher than in situ water temperatures, while daily maximum air temperatures measured by weather stations were up to 23. 2 °C, and on average 4. 2 °C, lower than in situ air temperatures over a 14 -month period. The frequency, duration and number of days greater than 30 °C, as well as rates of temperature change, were all significantly lower when measured by weather stations. These differences suggest that satellite SSTs and weather stations are ineffective at capturing extremes in intertidal water and air temperature variability, which considerably influence biological processes. Therefore, to understand the impacts of temperature variability on populations at scales relevant to demographic processes we need to use emerging data logger and infrared technology. Despite the fact that experimental manipulations are essential for determining causation, there are few studies that successfully manipulate temperatures on rocky intertidal shores to test for effects on early life history processes. I used different coloured settlement plates deployed within the mid shore region to experimentally alter the substratum temperatures experienced by newly settled T. rosea larvae. I found that maximum mean surface temperatures of black and grey plates were 5. 8 °C and 4. 8 °C warmer than white plates, respectively. Black and grey plates over the entire sampling period were on average 2. 2 °C and 1. 6 °C warmer than white plates, respectively. Importantly, cooler white plates had significantly greater settlement and early postsettlement growth of T. rosea than warmer black plates. However, temperature differences between black and white plates did not influence early survival and recruitment. Substratum temperatures of unmodified areas within mid intertidal regions increased with increasing free space (r 2 = 0. 75, pT. rosea. Therefore, I undertook a manipulative thermal experiment that altered mid intertidal rock temperatures (which considerably influence body temperatures of recently settled T. rosea) by manipulating the amount of free space, a limiting resource for benthic invertebrates. Quadrats withT. rosea. Here, I found that natural temperature variability between quadrats with 100 % free space (i. e. across areas that were unmanipulated) significantly influenced the early post-settlement growth and survival of T. rosea. Such among-quadrat variation at the same tidal height on shore is both underappreciated and a potentially confounding factor in studies of recruitment and population dynamics. Finally, I used IR imagery to test the hypothesis that in situ rocky substrates exhibit repeatable ultra fine-scale (1 mm) temperature variation during aerial exposure and that this variability significantly influences early life history processes of T. rosea. Here, larval settlement did not vary with ultra fine-scale variation in rock temperature, but early post-settlement growth and survival were both inversely related to temperature variability at this scale. Furthermore, I found that rock temperatures decreased significantly with increasing proximity to adult T. rosea and that larvae that settled within 15 mm of adults survived better than those that settled within 16 - 30 mm. This is partially explained by conspecific adults shading rock and reducing rock temperatures. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that fine-scale variation in thermal stress impacts the early-life history stages of a benthic marine invertebrate. The results of my research have broad ranging implications for understanding how rocky intertidal invertebrates will respond to increasing temperatures and extreme events associated with climate change. Firstly, the geographic distribution of T. rosea does not appear to be limited by a reduction in air and seawater temperatures towards its southern range limit and therefore increasing temperatures may not cause T. rosea to extend its southern distribution. Secondly, broad-scale temperature measurements derived from weather stations and satellites are not the most appropriate estimates of rocky intertidal temperature variability. Therefore, climate change models and predictions should preferentially use local-scale, or better yet, estimates of temperature variability relevant to individuals. Thirdly, the thermal manipulations developed in this study may be particularly useful for simulating the effects of future temperature variability or extreme temperature events on intertidal communities because they can directly elevate body temperatures to reflect future scenarios and do not require longterm monitoring or extreme weather to simulate extreme events. Finally, the high within site temperature variability revealed by IR imaging may override the effect of largescale temperature variability on intertidal populations and reduce our ability to predict the effects of climate change on species distributions. In summary, numerous factors need to be considered when assessing the effect of temperature on the early life history processes of intertidal invertebrates, including consistent small-scale temperature variability. The results of this study show that for a single species, the effects of temperature not only vary during different life history stages, but also, across different spatial scales. These findings contribute to, and advance, the growing body of work that highlights the importance of small-scale temperature variability in influencing the biogeographic and physiological responses of rocky intertidal communities in the face of climate change...|$|R
