500|$|The {{following}} day, Hendrix {{received a}} phone call from one of his girlfriends, Devon Wilson, who had become jealous after hearing rumors that he was dating another woman, Kirsten Nefer. Nefer recalled: [...] "I heard Jimi talk to Devon... she was mad... she went into fits... Jimi said 'Devon, get off my back'". Hendrix was scheduled to perform in Rotterdam on September 13, but the show, along with three others, was cancelled due to Cox's incapacitation. During the evening of September 13, Nefer visited Hendrix at the Cumberland. After informing him that she would have to go back to work that evening, he convinced her to phone her boss, actor George Lazenby, and ask for the night off. Lazenby became angry and <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> phone to Nefer: [...] "You're nothing but a fucking groupie", which Hendrix overheard. The exchange upset him, and he told Nefer: [...] "Don't you ever go out to that guy again". Nefer explained to him that she had spent six months working on a film with Lazenby and that she did not want to quit her job; Hendrix eventually agreed. Nefer spent the night with him and left in the morning.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 7 November 1976, three insurgents {{from a group of}} seven were spotted by an Army observation post in the Mutema Tribal Trust Lands, just south-west of Birchenough Bridge in Manicaland province. Fireforce was called up and the Rhodesians readied themselves to fly out by helicopter and engage the guerrillas. There were eight four-man [...] "stops" [...] involved in a Fireforce, and on this occasion Lamb headed Stop 2. Just before they left, Lamb ran over to Lance-Corporal Phil Kaye, the leader of Stop 3, and <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> noise of the aircraft. [...] "They are going to get me this time," [...] he yelled, sardonically; [...] "Just you watch, Phil Kaye!" [...] Kaye and his MAG gunner, Trooper Pat Grogan, waved away this comment and told Lamb to get moving. [...] "Go nail gooks!" [...] Kaye called after Lamb as he and the rest of Stop 2 took off aboard their Alouette III gunship. Lamb's men were an 18-year-old national service MAG gunner of Portuguese-Rhodesian extraction named Trooper Soares; Trooper Cornelius Olivier, a 20-year-old Rhodesian regular who carried an FN FAL battle rifle; and Trooper Tony Rok, an Australian Vietnam veteran, aged 28 and also equipped with an FN. Lamb carried the stick's radio on his back with his FN FAL ready in his hands.|$|E
2500|$|Sandy Irons {{was banned}} by George Noory due to Irons simply calling in to bash fan {{theories}} surrounding Supreme Leader Snoke of the Star Wars franchise. Irons' final call in was on August 16, 2017 when he <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> phone, [...] "Your Snoke theory sucks! All Snoke theories suck!" [...] {{as soon as}} he got on the line. Noory simply asked Irons for his own Snoke theory and Irons began shouting again. Noory dumped him mid-shouting and Irons was banned from the program.|$|E
50|$|Väinämöinen and Ilmarinen {{meet with}} each other along <b>the</b> journey, and <b>shouting</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> waters and snowfields agree to a {{friendly}} pact and agree to be happy for whomever wins {{the hand of the}} beautiful Pohjola maiden.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come on! We {{must get}} those two twins' names,' said Una, and they charged uphill <b>shouting</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> hedge, till Nurse slowed {{up and told}} them. When they returned, old Middenboro had {{got out of his}} stall, and they spent a lively ten minutes chasing him in again by starlight.|$|R
5000|$|At {{times the}} dealer needs to {{communicate}} with the floor, or other casino staff. Some casinos equip the dealers with a headset or walkie-talkie for this purpose, while in other casinos <b>the</b> dealer must <b>shout</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ambient noise. The following table shows some common calls a dealer may make, and their meanings: ...|$|R

6000|$|They {{proceeded}} to the station--found the station-master--were conducted {{down to the}} signal-box. Lilly naturally hung back from people, but Jim was hob-nob with the station-master and the signal man, quite officer-and-my-men kind of thing. Lilly sat out {{on the steps of}} the signal-box, rather ashamed, while the long telegram was <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> telephone to the junction town--first the young lady and her address, then the message [...] "Meet me X. station 3:40 tomorrow walk back great pleasure Jim." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{four in the}} afternoon, therefore, the {{bombardment}} was renewed; and in less than half an hour, a white flag appeared above the wall. As, however, the garrison made no further sign of surrender, and refused to admit Colonel Clive with his troops, when he advanced to take possession, {{the bombardment}} was again renewed, more vigorously than ever. The enemy were unable to support {{the violence of the}} fire, and soon <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> walls, to Clive, that they surrendered; and he might enter and take possession. He at once marched in, and the pirates laid down their arms, and surrendered themselves prisoners.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Another time, too,' added Lady Merrifield, 'remember that {{it would}} be proper to come down and speak to me instead of <b>shouting</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> balusters in that unmannerly way; without so much as taking leave of your Aunt Jane. If she had not been almost late for her train, I should have insisted.' ...|$|R
2500|$|On the 2005 Family Guy episode Don't Make Me Over, Peter's band Fat, Horny, Black, and Joe accidentally {{starts a}} prison riot.

[...] and is cut off when a chair hits him.|$|R
50|$|Psyche {{was formed}} by {{brothers}} Darrin and Stephen Huss in Edmonton, Alberta, named after the B-Side of Killing Joke's Wardance single {{as well as being}} chosen for the meaning of the word. The band's debut performance was on December 13, 1982 with Dwayne Goettel on additional keyboards. During this period, Psyche were known for their bizarre live shows wherein Darrin performed nude (except for being covered in shaving cream) while talk-singing and <b>shouting</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> music. The performance idea was inspired by pictures seen of Fad Gadget in British Music magazines.|$|R
60|$|Everybody drank; {{the wounded}} drank; Oofty-Oofty, who helped me, drank. Only Louis refrained, {{no more than}} {{cautiously}} wetting his lips with the liquor, though he joined in the revels with an abandon {{equal to that of}} most of them. It was a saturnalia. In loud voices they <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> day’s fighting, wrangled about details, or waxed affectionate and made friends with the men whom they had fought. Prisoners and captors hiccoughed on one another’s shoulders, and swore mighty oaths of respect and esteem. They wept over the miseries of the past and over the miseries yet to come under the iron rule of Wolf Larsen. And all cursed him and told terrible tales of his brutality.|$|E
6000|$|Everybody was in {{everybody}} else's way; {{nor was there}} one who failed to proclaim it {{at the top of}} his lungs. A thousand gold-seekers were clamoring for the immediate landing of their outfits. Each hatchway gaped wide open, and from the lower depths the shrieking donkey-engines were hurrying the misassorted outfits skyward. On either side of the steamer, rows of scows received the flying cargo, and on each of these scows a sweating mob of men charged the descending slings and heaved bales and boxes about in frantic search. Men waved shipping receipts and <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> steamer-rails to them. Sometimes two and three identified the same article, and war arose. The [...] "two-circle" [...] and the [...] "circle-and-dot" [...] brands caused endless jangling, while every whipsaw discovered a dozen claimants.|$|E
6000|$|An enthusiast {{who had a}} {{new system}} of musical notation, wrote to me and {{suggested}} that a magazine article from me, contrasting the absurdities of the old system with the simplicities of his new one, would be sure to make a [...] "rousing hit." [...] He shouted and <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> marvels wrought by his system, and quoted the handsome compliments which had been paid it by famous musical people; but he forgot to tell me what his notation was like, or what its simplicities consisted in. So I could not have written the article if I had wanted to--which I didn't; because I hate strangers with axes to grind. I wrote him a courteous note explaining how busy I was--I always explain how busy I am--and casually drooped this remark: ...|$|E
50|$|After months {{writing and}} experimenting {{they decided to}} recruit a vocalist, one that with a {{powerful}} voice able to <b>shout</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> heavy sound which {{was a part of}} all their songs at the time. It was because of a recommendation from Alejandro Rosso (current Plastilina Mosh member) that Fernando Martz joined Zurdok. Later, keyboardist Gustavo Mauricio was brought in, and the Zurdok Movimento project was taken more seriously.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am tired}} of fine French names," [...] she said: [...] "an English voice is quite refreshing; and do you call me Naomi, not Noemi. I did not mind it so much at first, because my father {{sometimes}} called me so, after his good old mother, who was bred a Huguenot, but {{it is like the}} first step towards home to hear Naomi--Little Omy, as my brothers used to <b>shout</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> stairs." ...|$|R
50|$|Camouflaged Canadian soldiers, {{equipped}} with the Boys Mk.1 rifle, start to emerge from various secret positions to stop the advancing tanks, hitting them repeatedly with accurate rounds. Hitler’s tank receives a direct hit from the Canadian troops’ fire and tumbles straight down into hell. In front of a huge, red, round-faced Satan, Hitler begins throwing an hysterical tantrum on <b>the</b> floor <b>over</b> his defeat. Satan, <b>shouting</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> increasingly loud and irrational tantrum, indicates Hitler believes that against the anti-tank rifle, he cannot win.|$|R
6000|$|The {{darkness}} {{came from}} the hills, flowed over the coast, put out the red fires of sunset, {{and went on to}} seaward pursuing the retiring tide. The wind dropped with the sun, leaving a maddened sea and a devastated sky. The heavens above the house seemed to be draped in black rags, held up here and there by pins of fire. Madame Levaille, for this evening the servant of her own workmen, tried to induce them to depart. [...] "An old woman like me ought to be in bed at this late hour," [...] she good-humouredly repeated. The quarrymen drank, asked for more. They <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> table {{as if they had been}} talking across a field. At one end four of them played cards, banging the wood with their hard knuckles, and swearing at every lead. One sat with a lost gaze, humming a bar of some song, which he repeated endlessly. Two others, in a corner, were quarrelling confidentially and fiercely over some woman, looking close into one another's eyes as if they had wanted to tear them out, but speaking in whispers that promised violence and murder discreetly, in a venomous sibillation of subdued words. The atmosphere in there was thick enough to slice with a knife. Three candles burning about the long room glowed red and dull like sparks expiring in ashes.|$|E
5000|$|Mr. Dent {{could also}} paint with his feet, but seldom {{did so in}} public. What he called his [...] "dance on canvas" [...] {{featured}} maniacal, mesmerizing movement, but he regarded the sermons he <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> music while he painted as his main mission. He said he turned down mention in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's fastest artist because he feared the distinction might detract from his inspirational message about the saving graces of art.|$|E

25|$|Dean, who {{had been}} {{suffering}} with a severe bout of the flu for several days, attended a post-caucus rally for his volunteers at the Val-Air Ballroom in West Des Moines, Iowa and delivered his concession speech, aimed at cheering up those in attendance. Dean was <b>shouting</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> cheers of his enthusiastic audience, but the crowd noise was being filtered out by his unidirectional microphone, leaving only his full-throated exhortations audible to the television viewers. To those at home, he seemed to raise his voice out of sheer emotion.|$|R

50|$|The songs lyrics {{deal with}} people's day-to-day lives - getting {{stuck in the}} same {{routines}} and casting aside ambitions. Raoul, a sandwich shop owner in Cardiff, was where the band went during days spent in their studio {{to get away from}} this drill. The vocals on Raoul were originally split three ways between Robin Hawkins (lead), Alex Pennie (<b>shouts</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top) and James Frost (joint lead in the second verse and backing in the choruses). After Pennie's departure and the addition of Paul Mullen in 2007 the vocals continued to be split three ways. In 2008, the band re-worked the track, replacing the guitar and bass guitar in the first verse, with both Frost and Mullen playing synthesisers, building into two guitars in the choruses.|$|R
5000|$|Though many bowlers {{were slow}} to embrace the catchphrase, it has become {{extremely}} popular with PBA management, {{and even more so}} with bowling fans who now bring [...] "hambone" [...] placards to flash on camera whenever someone rolls four straight strikes. In a February 17, 2008, match, Hall of Fame bowler Pete Weber, after rolling a fourth consecutive strike, pointed to Stone in the TV booth and <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> cheers, [...] "Rob Stone, here's your hambone!" [...] while performing his trademark chop. Even PBA's official bowling app, PBA Challenge, refers to four strikes as a hambone during game play.|$|E
5000|$|Archibald and Isobel {{lost the}} Forrester house, and the lands she held near Peebles when James V reached his {{majority}} and {{escaped from the}} Douglases. On 5 September 1528 the Earl of Angus <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Tweed to the Earl of Northumberland's steward that if his family was forced into exile at Norham Castle, Isobel Hoppar would wait on his daughter Margaret Douglas. Isobel continued to serve Margaret as her [...] "gentlewoman" [...] at Berwick Castle. The English diplomat Thomas Magnus wrote that Isobel [...] "totally ordoured" [...] Kilspindie, and in turn Kilspindie and George Douglas had brought the Earl of Angus to his troubles. [...] Kilspindie's house {{was given to the}} new treasurer Robert Cairncross.|$|E
5000|$|Dallas Chief of Police Jesse Curry {{was riding}} in the lead car of the Presidential {{motorcade}} with sheriff James Eric “Bill” Decker when they turned west off Houston Street onto Elm Street. Looking straight ahead, they noticed [...] "a few unauthorized people on the overpass and wondered how they got there." [...] Those people were later described as thirteen railroad men and two policemen who were stationed on the overpass (Triple Underpass) against rules of protocol. After the Presidential motorcade had proceeded a few more yards, Curry heard the first gunshot and immediately <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> police radio: [...] "Get a man {{on top of that}} triple underpass and see what happened up there!" [...] His words sounded an alarm that something was dreadfully wrong.|$|E
5000|$|Blazkowicz, {{with his}} newly found information, is then parachuted into Norway, close to Deathshead's mysterious [...] "X-Labs". After {{breaking}} into the facility, which has been overrun by the twisted creatures he encountered in Kugelstadt (dubbed 'Lopers'), Blazkowicz retrieves Deathshead's journal, its content directly linking Deathshead's research {{to the rest of}} the SS Paranormal's occult activity. He then confronts several new prototype creatures called Übersoldaten (super soldiers), towering monstrosities coated in armor, powered by hydraulic legs and carrying powerful weapons. Finally catching up with Deathshead, Blazkowicz comes face to face with a completed and fully armored Übersoldat, and kills the researchers who have developed it. After the Übersoldat is destroyed, Deathshead <b>shouts</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> speakers in frustration and astonishment before escaping in a Kobra rocket-plane and disappears for the rest of the game.|$|R

5000|$|Ishidori Matsuri (石取祭) can be {{literally}} {{translated from}} Japanese as [...] "stone bringing festival." [...] It is a festival in Kuwana, located in Mie Prefecture. The festival starts {{on the first}} Saturday of August, at midnight, and runs throughout the weekend. Every town within {{the central part of}} the city has its own 3 wheeled, highly decorative festival cart. Each cart has a large taiko drum at the back and several kane along the sides. Each town has a particular sequence for each of those instruments, creating a unique and identifying sound. Another identifying feature is the placement of <b>the</b> kakegoe, or <b>shouts.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> course of the weekend, the carts are pulled toward Kasuga Shrine for presentation, performing along <b>the</b> way. With <b>over</b> 30 carts with distinct rhythms, it has been said that the Kuwana festival is the loudest festival in Japan.|$|R
5000|$|When James V {{reached his}} {{majority}} and {{escaped from the}} Douglases in 1528, Archibald and Isobel lost the Forrester house, and the lands she held near Peebles. On 5 September 1528 the Earl of Angus <b>shouted</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Tweed to the Earl of Northumberland's steward that he should expect them and the young Earl of Huntly as refugees at Norham Castle. If his family was forced into exile, Isobel Hoppar would wait on his daughter Margaret Douglas.

Isobel continued to serve Margaret as her [...] "gentlewoman" [...] at Berwick Castle.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{subsequent}} trial, the defense {{claimed that the}} explosions were detonated at the wrong time. Randall Robinson, an assistant cameraman on board the helicopter, testified that production manager Dan Allingham told Wingo, [...] "That's too much.

[...] Robinson said that Wingo tried to leave the area, but that [...] "we lost our control and regained it and then I could feel something let go and we began spinning around in circles." [...] Stephen Lydecker, also a camera operator on board, testified that Landis had earlier [...] "shrugged off" [...] warnings about the stunt with the comment [...] "We may lose the helicopter."

Lands in Cunninghame went to Robert, Lord Maxwell, and Reidside near Tantallon Castle was given to Hugh Johnson, the King's cook. The Douglases were already on the Scottish borders or in exile in England, and James laid siege to their castle at Tantallon.

Lowe's method of DJ-ing was high octane and fast-paced, similar to many hip hop DJs, with samples of radio stations, interview clips and Radio 1 stings thrown in between songs, {{along with the}} occasional sound of Lowe singing along to the music. A key feature of his broadcasting style was to avoid {{the use of the}} fader to reduce the volume of the track being played during intros and outros, choosing instead to talk or <b>shout</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> tracks which are played at undiminished volume. The show developed a number of features including [...] "Hottest Record In The World Right Now", [...] "masterpieces" [...] and the [...] "Zane Lowe Meets" [...] interviews, including interviews with Jay-Z, Kanye West, Chris Martin, Eminem and Rick Rubin.|$|R
