The presence of thick flange improves the shear buckling strength of plate girder.

40|$|Abstract-Behavior of {{structure}} during earthquake motion depends on distribution of weight, stiffness and strength in both {{horizontal and vertical}} planes of building. To reduce the effect of earthquake elements <b>steel</b> plate <b>shear</b> walls {{are used in the}} building. These can be used for improving seismic response of buildings. The main role of <b>steel</b> <b>shear</b> wall is to collect lateral forces of earthquake in a building and transfer those forces to the foundation. The web plates in <b>steel</b> <b>shear</b> walls are categorized according to their ability to resist buckling. The web plates can be sufficiently stiffened to preclude buckling and allow the full shear strength of the web to be reached. Shear walls are the walls like vertically aligned structural components which are subjected to lateral loads in their plane. These have proved to be very effective for lateral load resistance particularly in the medium to high-rise buildings. These depending upon the material of construction they may be classified as the RCC and <b>steel</b> <b>shear</b> walls. <b>Steel</b> structures are generally lighter than masonry or RC structures. Lower weight translates to lower seismic forces. Steel structures typically show good ductility, even when they are not specifically designed or detailed for seismic resistance. The beams, columns and the plate together act as the vertical plate girder. The columns act as the flanges, the plate as the web and the beams as the horizontal stiffeners of the plate girder.

Design codes, such as ACI 318 - 14, require special reinforcement for concrete anchors in concrete that could be substantially damaged during an earthquake.

The column specimens were subjected to quasi-static cyclic loading before the test anchors were loaded in <b>shear.</b> <b>Steel</b> fracture was achieved in both test anchors despite cracks and concrete spalling occurred to the concrete within the plastic hinge zones. Meanwhile, the measured anchor capacities were smaller than the code-specified capacity, especially for the anchors subjected to cyclic shear. Concrete cover spalling was found critical to the observed capacity reduction, which caused combined bending and shear action in the anchor bolts. Measures should be developed to mitigate such adverse impact. In addition, further studies are needed for post-installed anchors before practical applications.|$|E

Previous experimental tests have also shown that significant differences exist in the angle of crack of shear failure of NSC and HSC. This paper presents data from five beam tests, which demonstrate that HSC with limestone aggregate has a reduced shear strength compared with NSC made with gravel and thus shows a gap in knowledge in the design approach to shear resistance of HSC beams. Previous investigations have suggested that horizontal web steels can contribute to the overall shear resistance of a reinforced concrete member in conjunction with the other constituents, concrete, tension and <b>shear</b> <b>steel.</b> The paper also presents data from tests on 11 beam tests and shows that the shear resistance of HSC beams is highly dependent on dowel action resulting from horizontal web bars positioned at the centre of the depth of the beam.

As the bridge deck slab deteriorated over time due to the environmental conditions, these <b>shear</b> <b>steel</b> dowels are also susceptible to sever corrosion and will need replacement, especially when de-icing salt is used. This results in gradual loss of the composite behavior and strength of the composite section.

The most popular dowels used in Australian coal mines are the 22 mm diameter fully threaded type. FG bolts are cuttable, easy to handle, lightweight and corrosion resistant. The tested dowels were all black in colour, which is a favoured colour in coal mines. A series of tests were undertaken to evaluate various strength properties of FG dowels. These tests include the tensile failure test by the double-embedment method, single guillotine shear test, double shear test both in steel frame and in concrete blocks, and finally the punch shear test.

40|$|This thesis proposes an {{explicit}} methodology for optimising {{the cost of}} the preliminary design layout of framed Reinforced Concrete (RC) buildings. The design of the column layout for RC buildings was studied first, followed by the optimum location of columns for the RC structures. The next step was to optimise the layout including the location of the columns and the rectilinear shapes for the plan layout and the rectilinear shapes proposed for the RC buildings. In order to formulate such a methodology a model was developed to represent the mathematical relationship between the costs of concrete, longitudinal steel, <b>shear</b> <b>steel,</b> and formwork, and the number and size of the spans and the shape of the plan. Such a model illustrates how variations in the layout affects the cost elements, and how each cost element varies when the layout changes. A unique mathematical relationship between the design layout and cost elements was formulated for structural systems such as continuous beams, plane frames, 3 D frames, flat plates and beam-slab floor systems, in order to study different responses towards variations in the layout. This is a novel approach that can easily be used to optimise the design of various types of large RC structures and also account for constraints imposed by the design standards. This approach makes use of cross sectional effects such as the positive and negative bending moments, and the shear and axial forces along the structural members for each structural system to derive a novel cost function as an alternative to traditional cost functions for optimising the layout of RC structures where design variables are used. These novel functions can be used to optimise the cost and layout of RC ii structures, because they are represented in a new space that takes the cost elements and layout design variables into account. A combined approach was adapted to deal with a new structural optimisation problem, so an automated technique for optimising the preliminary layout of framed buildings with rectilinear patterns is presented. This method supports all types of rectilinear buildings (also known as orthogonal or iso-oriented) plans, including rectangular frames where the number and size of the spans and the shape of the plan can be variables. To that end, the knapsack problem was used as a basic applied combinatorial optimisation problem. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), as a robust metaheuristic, was used to solve the combinatorial optimisation arising from the structural optimisation problem. Numerical examples for each structural system are presented to demonstrate the robustness and practicality of the methodology and algorithms...|$|E
