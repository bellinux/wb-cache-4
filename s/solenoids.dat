25|$|The smaller, lower-powered <b>solenoids</b> {{were first}} to be transistorized, {{followed}} later by the higher-current <b>solenoids</b> as the price, performance, and reliability of power transistors improved over the years.|$|E
25|$|All {{but very}} old games use low DC {{voltages}} {{to power the}} <b>solenoids</b> and electronics (or relays). Some microprocessor games use high voltages (potentially hazardous) for the score displays. Very early games used low-voltage AC power for <b>solenoids,</b> requiring fewer components, but AC is less efficient for powering <b>solenoids,</b> causing heavier wiring and slower performance. For locations that suffer from low AC wall outlet voltage, additional taps may be provided on the AC transformer in electromechanical games to permit raising the game's DC voltage levels, thus strengthening the <b>solenoids.</b> Microprocessor games have electronic power supplies that automatically compensate for inaccurate AC supply voltages.|$|E
25|$|Early pinball {{machines}} typically had full solenoid current passing through trigger switches {{for all types}} of <b>solenoids,</b> from kickers to pop bumpers to the flippers themselves. This caused arcing across switch contacts and rapid contact fouling and failure. As electronics were gradually implemented in pinball design, <b>solenoids</b> began to be switched by power transistors under software control to lower switch voltage and current, vastly extend switch service lifetime, and add flexibility to game design.|$|E
50|$|In engineering, {{the term}} may also {{refer to a}} variety of {{transducer}} devices that convert energy into linear motion. The term is also often used to refer to a <b>solenoid</b> valve, which is an integrated device containing an electromechanical <b>solenoid</b> which actuates either a pneumatic or hydraulic valve, or a <b>solenoid</b> switch, which is a specific type of relay that internally uses an electromechanical <b>solenoid</b> to operate an electrical switch; for example, an automobile starter <b>solenoid,</b> or a linear <b>solenoid,</b> which is an electromechanical <b>solenoid.</b> <b>Solenoid</b> bolts, a type of electronic-mechanical locking mechanism, also exist.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Solenoid</b> valves {{are also}} {{characterized}} by how they operate. A small <b>solenoid</b> can generate a limited force. If that force {{is sufficient to}} open and close the valve, then a direct acting <b>solenoid</b> valve is possible. An approximate relationship between the required <b>solenoid</b> force Fs, the fluid pressure P, and the orifice area A for a direct acting <b>solenoid</b> value is: ...|$|R
5000|$|A finite <b>solenoid</b> is a <b>solenoid</b> with finite length. Continuous {{means that}} the <b>solenoid</b> is not formed by {{discrete}} coils but by a sheet of conductive material. We assume the current is uniformly distributed {{on the surface of}} the <b>solenoid,</b> with a surface current density K; in cylindrical coordinates: ...|$|R
25|$|A {{table of}} {{inductance}} for short <b>solenoids</b> of various diameter to length ratios has been calculated by Dellinger, Whittmore, and Ould.|$|E
25|$|All <b>solenoids</b> and coils used on {{microprocessor}} games {{include a}} special reverse-biased diode {{to eliminate a}} high-voltage pulse of reverse EMF (electromotive force). Without this diode, when the solenoid is de-energized, the magnetic field that was built up in the coil collapses and generates a brief, high-voltage pulse backward into the wiring, capable of destroying the solid-state components used to control the solenoid. Proper wiring polarity must be retained during coil replacement or this diode will act as a dead short, immediately destroying electronic switches. Older electromechanical AC game <b>solenoids</b> do not require this diode, since they were controlled with mechanical switches. However, electromechanical games running on DC do require diodes to protect the rectifier.|$|E
25|$|Electric motors {{are used}} to produce linear or rotary force (torque), and should be {{distinguished}} from devices such as magnetic <b>solenoids</b> and loudspeakers that convert electricity into motion but do not generate usable mechanical powers, which are respectively referred to as actuators and transducers.|$|E
50|$|An {{infinite}} <b>solenoid</b> is a <b>solenoid</b> with infinite length but finite diameter. Continuous {{means that}} the <b>solenoid</b> is not formed by discrete finite-width coils but by infinitely many infinitely-thin coils with no space between them; in this abstraction, the <b>solenoid</b> is often viewed as a cylindrical sheet of conductive material.|$|R
50|$|The {{starter motor}} is a series, compound, or {{permanent}} magnet type electric motor with a <b>solenoid</b> and <b>solenoid</b> operated switch mounted on it. When low-current {{power from the}} starting battery {{is applied to the}} starter <b>solenoid,</b> usually through a key-operated switch, the <b>solenoid</b> closes high-current contacts for the starter motor and it starts to run. Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened and the <b>solenoid</b> opens the contacts to the starter motor.|$|R
50|$|A <b>solenoid</b> brake is an {{electrically}} controlled brake. The brake {{is turned}} on and off by an electrical <b>solenoid.</b> Typically a spring engages the brake when unpowered, and the <b>solenoid</b> releases it when powered.|$|R
25|$|<b>Solenoids</b> also control pop-bumpers, kickbacks, drop target resets, {{and many}} other {{features}} on the machine. These solenoid coils contain a single coil winding. The plunger size and wire gage & length are matched to the strength required for each coil to do its work, so some types are repeated throughout the game, some are not.|$|E
25|$|The {{electro-pneumatic}} {{action was}} invented by Robert Hope-Jones, and {{is considered by many}} to be the single most significant development in pipe organs. Up to the turn of the 20th century, all pipe organs were operated by a tracker, tubular pneumatic, or pneumatic Barker-lever action, where the keys and pedals were physically connected to the pipe valves via wooden trackers, except in the case of tubular pneumatic, where all actions were operated by air pressure. Hope-Jones' electro-pneumatic action eliminated this by using wind pressure, controlled by electric <b>solenoids,</b> to operate the pipe valves, and <b>solenoids</b> and pistons to control and operate the various stop tabs, controls, keys and pedals on the console. This action allowed the console to be physically detached from the organ. All signals from the console were transmitted by an electric cable to an electro-pneumatic relay, and from there to the pipes and effects in the organ chambers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Solenoids</b> or coils: These {{are found}} in every modern pinball machine since the flipper age. They are usually hidden under the playfield, or covered by playfield components. By {{applying}} power to the coil, the magnetic field created by electromagnetism causes a metal object (usually called a plunger) to move. The plunger is then connected mechanically to a feature or accessory on the playfield.|$|E
3000|$|The {{air mass}} flow rate through the <b>solenoid</b> valve is mainly decided by the {{upstream}} and downstream air pressures of the <b>solenoid</b> valve. Based on the modeling assumptions, the on-off <b>solenoid</b> valve is abstracted to a thin wall orifice, thus the nonlinear {{air mass flow}} characteristics through the <b>solenoid</b> valve is expressed mathematically as [27, 28] [...]...|$|R
5000|$|The {{technician}} {{installing the}} <b>solenoid</b> had obtained a properly fitting part when discovering the <b>solenoid</b> did not properly fit the valve, instead of forcing {{it in with}} a tool (the installed valve was a newer design, for which the older <b>solenoid</b> was dimensionally incompatible, and tool marks on the <b>solenoid</b> show that it was forced in).|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} of a superconducting focusing <b>solenoid</b> {{for use in}} an RF linac has been built and tested at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL). The <b>solenoid</b> is comprised of the main coil, two bucking coils, two dipole corrector windings, and a low carbon steel flux return. At the excitation current of 250 A, the magnetic field reaches 7. 2 T {{in the center of}} the <b>solenoid</b> and is less than 5 G on the axis at a distance of 150 mm from the center. The length of the <b>solenoid</b> is 150 mm; the length of a cryovessel for the <b>solenoid</b> with a 20 mm diameter 'warm' bore is 270 mm. This paper presents the main design features of the focusing <b>solenoid</b> and discusses results from tests of the <b>solenoid...</b>|$|R
25|$|In actual fact, the {{resulting}} {{field in the}} coils is not an exact analog of the original. It {{would be if the}} field coils consisted of a single loop of wire, but as they actually consist of multiple windings, these are, in effect, small <b>solenoids.</b> The resulting field is then strongest {{at the edges of the}} windings, falling (ideally) to zero in the center.|$|E
25|$|Some {{automobile}} passenger {{heating systems}} have a {{thermostatically controlled valve}} to regulate the water flow and temperature to an adjustable level. In older vehicles the thermostat controls the application of engine vacuum to actuators that control water valves and flappers to direct the flow of air. In modern vehicles, the vacuum actuators may be operated by small <b>solenoids</b> {{under the control of}} a central computer.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this design}} could present a {{challenge}} to one who is troubleshooting a convertible top malfunction. The system consists of a spiderweb of <b>solenoids,</b> relays, limit switches, electric motors, a hydraulic pump/reservoir, hydraulic directional valves and cylinders. While the hydraulics are not often a cause for trouble, the electrical relays are known to fail. Failure {{of any of the}} relays, motors or limit switches will prevent the convertible system from completing the cycle.|$|E
50|$|As a {{topological space}} the dyadic <b>solenoid</b> is a <b>solenoid,</b> and an indecomposable continuum.|$|R
2500|$|Magnetic circuit {{breakers}} use a <b>solenoid</b> (electromagnet) whose pulling force increases with the current. Certain designs utilize electromagnetic forces {{in addition to}} those of the <b>solenoid.</b> The circuit breaker contacts are held closed by a latch. As the current in the <b>solenoid</b> increases beyond the rating of the circuit breaker, the <b>solenoid's</b> pull releases the latch, which lets the contacts open by spring action.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the Dirac equation in the magnetic-solenoid field (the field of a <b>solenoid</b> and a collinear uniform magnetic field). For {{the case of}} Aharonov-Bohm <b>solenoid,</b> we construct self-adjoint extensions of the Dirac Hamiltonian using von Neumann’s theory of deficiency indices. We find self-adjoint extensions of the Dirac Hamiltonian and boundary conditions at the AB <b>solenoid.</b> Besides, for the first time, solutions of the Dirac equation in the magnetic-solenoid field with a finite radius <b>solenoid</b> were found. We study the structure of these solutions and their dependence {{on the behavior of}} the magnetic field inside the <b>solenoid.</b> Then we exploit the latter solutions to specify boundary conditions for the magnetic-solenoid field with Aharonov-Bohm <b>solenoid.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|B–T, and {{rotating}} {{loops of}} various sorts, {{continued to be}} used in the post-war era by civilians. Improvements continued to be made to both systems throughout this period, especially the introduction of <b>solenoids</b> in place of conventional loops in some roles. However, the introduction of the doppler direction finder, and especially the low-cost electronics to implement it, led to the disappearance of the traditional loop systems by the mid-1990s. Doppler systems use fixed antennae, like BTDF, but handle the direction finding purely in signal processing.|$|E
25|$|The new series, Supercar, (1960–61) {{was created}} by Anderson and Reg Hill and marked several {{important}} advances for APF. Sylvia Anderson took on a larger role and became {{a partner in the}} company. The series was also the official debut of Supermarionation, the electronic system that made the marionettes more lifelike and convincing on screen. The system used the audio signal from pre-recorded tapes of the actors' voices to trigger <b>solenoids</b> installed in the heads of the puppets, making their lips move in synchronisation with the voices of the actors, and actresses.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{fault is}} detected, the circuit breaker {{contacts}} must open {{to interrupt the}} circuit; This is commonly done using mechanically stored energy contained within the breaker, such as a spring or compressed air to separate the contacts. Circuit breakers may also use the higher current caused by the fault to separate the contacts, such as thermal expansion or a magnetic field. Small circuit breakers typically have a manual control lever to switch off the load or reset a tripped breaker, while larger units use <b>solenoids</b> to trip the mechanism, and electric motors to restore energy to the springs.|$|E
40|$|<b>Solenoid</b> {{actuator}} is {{the most}} important device for driving the precise hydraulic valve. The reliable operation of <b>solenoid</b> actuator effects on the overall hydraulic system. The performance of <b>solenoid</b> actuator relies on frequency response and step response according to arbitrary input signal. In this paper, we performed the analysis for the components of <b>solenoid</b> actuator to satisfy the reliable operation and response characteristics through the reliability analysis, and also deducted the design equations to realize the reliable operation and fast response characteristics of <b>solenoid</b> actuator for hydraulic valve operation through the empirical knowledge of experts and electromagnetic theories. We suggested the design equations to determine the values of design parameters of <b>solenoid</b> actuator like bobbin size, length of yoke and plunger and turn number of coil, and calculated the life test time of <b>solenoid</b> actuator for verification of reliability of the prototype. In addition, for reducing the life test time, the acceleration model of <b>solenoid</b> actuator is proposed and the acceleration factor is calculated considering the field operating conditions. And then, we verified the achieved design values through accelerated life test and performance tests using some prototypes of <b>solenoid</b> actuators adapted in servo valve...|$|R
50|$|A common {{tractive}} electromagnet is a uniformly-wound <b>solenoid</b> and plunger. The <b>solenoid</b> is a coil of wire, and the plunger {{is made of}} {{a material}} such as soft iron. Applying a current to the <b>solenoid</b> applies a force to the plunger and may make it move. The plunger stops moving when the forces upon it are balanced. For example, the forces are balanced when the plunger is centered in the <b>solenoid.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most newer systems employ {{electromechanical}} or electronic controllers. In this scenario, {{the controller}} {{is connected to}} an electrical circuit that operates a <b>solenoid</b> attached to each valve (<b>solenoid</b> valve). When the <b>solenoid</b> is actuated, the water above the diaphragm is relieved and the valve opens.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} Selectric mechanism {{was designed}} and manufactured by the office equipment division of IBM and was not engineered {{for use as a}} computer terminal. Adapting this mechanism to the needs of computer input/output was not simple. Microswitches were added to the keyboard, <b>solenoids</b> were added to allow the computer to trigger the typing mechanism, and interface electronics were also needed. Several mechanical components, in particular the motor and the main clutch, had to be upgraded from the typewriter versions to reliably support continuous operation. Additional microswitches had to be added to sense the state of various parts of the mechanism, such as case (upper vs. lower).|$|E
25|$|A typical {{pinball machine}} I/O mix {{includes}} 16 to 24 outputs for driving <b>solenoids,</b> motors, electromagnets and other mechanical devices in the game. These devices can draw up to 500 W momentarily and operate at voltages up to 50 Vdc. There is also individually controlled lighting {{that consists of}} 64 to 96 individually addressable lights. Recently developed games have switched from incandescent bulbs to LEDs. And there is general illumination lighting that comprises two or more higher-power light strings connected and controlled in parallel for providing broad illumination to the playfield and backbox artwork. Additionally, 12 to 24 high-impulse lighting outputs, traditionally incandescent but now LED, provide flash effects within the game. Traditionally, these were often controlled by solenoid-level drivers.|$|E
25|$|Flipper <b>solenoids</b> contain two coil {{windings}} in one package; a short, heavy gage 'power' winding {{to give the}} flipper its initial thrust up, and a long, light gage 'hold' winding that uses lower power (and creates far less heat) and essentially just holds the flipper up allowing the player to capture {{the ball in the}} inlane for more precise aiming. As the flipper nears the end of its upward travel, a switch under the flipper disconnects the power-winding and leaves only the second sustain winding to hold the flipper up in place. If this switch fails 'open' the flipper will be too weak to be usable, since only the weak winding is available. If it fails 'closed' the coil will overheat and destroy itself, since both windings will hold the flipper at the top of its stroke.|$|E
50|$|Summary: The {{start of}} an {{injection}} {{is controlled by}} the <b>solenoid</b> closing point, and the injected fuel quantity is determined by the closing time, which is the length of time the <b>solenoid</b> remains closed. The <b>solenoid</b> operation is fully controlled by the engine ECU.|$|R

30|$|The <b>Solenoid</b> Unit of Instruction ([URL] {{developed}} through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) funding, contains five lab activities, two make activities, and one invent activity Tyler-Wood (2018). A <b>solenoid</b> is a {{coil of wire}} that acts like a magnet when a flow of electricity passes through it (<b>Solenoid</b> n.d.).
