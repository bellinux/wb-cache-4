2500|$|Sky Tower {{with the}} {{illuminated}} [...] "K" [...] in logo script {{at the top}} was built to support two attractions, the Parachute Sky Jump (now closed) and the Sky Cabin (now closed). Parachute Sky Jump boarded one or two standing riders anticipating {{the thrill of the}} drop into baskets beneath a faux parachute canopy. From the top, eight arms supported the vertical cable tracks of wire rope which lifted the baskets. The Sky Cabin ringed the <b>support</b> <b>pole</b> with a single floor of seats that are enclosed behind windows. The Sky Cabin ring revolves slowly as it rises to the top and back offering a pleasantly changing vista. Sky Cabin is very sensitive to weather and passenger motion, such as walking, which is prohibited during the trip. During winds 25mph+ or rain it is closed.

50|$|Umbrellas and parasols are {{primarily}} hand-held portable devices sized for personal use. The largest hand-portable umbrellas are golf umbrellas. Umbrellas {{can be divided}} into two categories: fully collapsible umbrellas, in which the metal pole supporting the canopy retracts, making the umbrella small enough to fit in a handbag; and non-collapsible umbrellas, in which the <b>support</b> <b>pole</b> cannot retract and only the canopy can be collapsed. Another distinction can be made between manually operated umbrellas and spring-loaded automatic umbrellas which spring open at the press of a button.|$|E
5000|$|The Gizmotchy is a {{variation}} of the Yagi. Each element consists of three rods arranged 120 degrees apart in an inverted [...] "Y" [...] configuration. The driven element is essentially a three-part dipole. One of these rods is the vertical driven rod, and one is the horizontal driven rod. The third rod is what would be the other half of a regular dipole and points downward 120 degrees from vertical {{on the opposite side of}} the <b>support</b> <b>pole</b> from the downward-pointing driven rod. The other elements are parasitic radiators like those of a Yagi except consisting of inverted [...] "Y"s.|$|E

Joe discusses his previous life experiences with her, before attempting to traverse the ski lift cable, and onto a <b>support</b> <b>pole</b> on the other side. By doing this, he also causes the chair Parker is sitting in to dangerously loosen from the cable. After scaring off a pair of wolves by using a ski pole, he slides down the mountain on Parker's snowboard, planning to return with help. The wolves give chase after him. Joe never returns and Parker spends the night alone on the loose cable.|$|E
50|$|Project Boreas {{considered}} {{the use of}} bioinspired robots to <b>support</b> <b>Pole</b> Station. ‘Arctic fox’, ‘Arctic hare’, ‘snow bunting’ (a flying robot) and ‘lemmings’ would support science and exploration objectives from Pole Station by enabling remotely controlled data collection at many spatial scales either from the rovers or from the station. The design study investigated communications for Pole Station and satellite requirements for sustaining base to field communications. The unique psycho-social issues associated with the long and permanently dark Martian polar winter were addressed.

5000|$|To {{dissipate}} atmospheric charge buildup, {{one side}} of the electrical distribution system is connected to the earth at many points throughout the distribution system, as often as on every <b>support</b> <b>pole.</b> The one earth-connected wire is commonly referred to as the [...] "protective earth", and provides path for the charge potential to dissipate without causing damage, and provides redundancy in case any one of the ground paths is poor due to corrosion or poor ground conductivity. The additional electric grounding wire that carries no power serves a secondary role, providing a high-current short-circuit path to rapidly blow fuses and render a damaged device safe, rather than have an ungrounded device with damaged insulation become [...] "electrically live" [...] via the grid power supply, and hazardous to touch.|$|E

50|$|Shortly thereafter, {{it became}} a monastery. Two houses with cells were built for nuns brought from Socola Monastery. Soon, Prince Alexander Mourousis moved the nuns to Agapia Monastery, and the cells were left {{in the hands of}} that establishment, as well as Văratec Monastery. It was during its {{affiliation}} with the nuns that the present name was bestowed. Aside from living quarters, the nuns used the cells to teach pupils and to host students and visitors. In 1819, the church was again rebuilt by postelnic Mihail Pascu. Following earthquakes, as well as bombings during World War II, the building was seriously deteriorated, so that exterior repairs were carried out in 1959. A new <b>support</b> <b>pole</b> for the spire cross was installed and interior varnishing was done in 1966.|$|E

5000|$|Set in the mid-1950s, {{the story}} is about the [...] "Wormsley Common Gang", a boys' gang named after {{the place where they}} live. The protagonist Trevor, or [...] "T.", devises a plan to destroy a {{beautiful}} two-hundred-year-old house that survived The Blitz. The gang accepts the plan by T., their new leader, and executes it when the owner of the house, Mr. Thomas (whom the gang call [...] "Old Misery"), is away during a bank holiday weekend. Their plan is to destroy the house from inside, then tear down the remaining outer structure. Mr. Thomas returns home early, however, and the gang locks him in the outhouse. T. refuses to stop until the destruction job is complete, because even the facade is valuable and could be reused. Inside, they find a mattress filled with money—which they burn. The final destruction of the house occurs when a lorry pulls away a <b>support</b> <b>pole</b> {{from the side of the}} house. Mr. Thomas is released from the outhouse by the lorry driver to see the rubble of what once was his home. When the driver finds the situation funny Mr. Thomas is incensed, but he is still unable to stop laughing.|$|E

40|$|A small robust {{system has}} been {{constructed}} for in-situ visual inspection of the Alcator C-Mod tokamak. The system consists of a small, light, wide-angle high definition camera and LED package housed in a nacelle {{on the end of}} thin, rigid, 3. 5 m long <b>support</b> <b>pole.</b> The nacelle has two actuated degrees of freedom allowing the camera to observe nearly 4 π steradians. The <b>support</b> <b>pole</b> has a specific slight curve that allows it to pass to either side of the center column of the tokamak to observe the entirety of the vessel interior, while still fitting through the small aspect ratio Alcator C-Mod vacuum port structure. The <b>support</b> <b>pole</b> and camera can enter the vessel through any horizontal vacuum port with an inner diameter greater than 4 cm, thus a dedicated port is not required. The inspection is typically undertaken during maintenance periods when the vessel is filled with a noble gas near atmospheric pressure thus minimizing the influx of water vapor and the concomitant loss of wall conditioning. The system is operated manually, producing photos and video which are reviewed in near real-time. Nearly the entire vessel, including the plasma facing components, can be carefully inspected in 3 – 5 h. The system provides improved characterization of the interior components and surfaces of the tokamak with a modest engineering and operational effort. Information gathered from the system has identified damage to plasma facing components that were interfering with tokamak operation, as well as damage to mechanical components which were redesigned during the remainder of the campaign, thereby enhancing program planning.

40|$|A tree belt {{bordering}} a road can be {{a useful}} and environmentally friendly noise abatement measure when specific guidelines are followed. However, biological limitations regarding biomass density largely limit their shielding efficiency.

The current study is a further elaboration on a previously performed large set of full-wave numerical calculations of tree belt planting schemes, where {{the effect of the}} presence of <b>supporting</b> <b>poles</b> is numerically investigated. It is shown that such poles can be used to give a juvenile non-deep tree belt a reasonable noise abatement, and that specific configurations of <b>supporting</b> <b>poles</b> in between the trees can further optimize its shielding. Making such poles absorbing could strongly increase road traffic noise abatement...|$|R
