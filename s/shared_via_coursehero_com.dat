40|$|The {{ability to}} {{automatically}} verify and classify course related documents {{is of interest}} to websites such as <b>CourseHero.</b> <b>com</b> and OutlineDepot. com. In particular, OutlineDepot. com manages more than 55, 000 law school outlines that must be manually verified and classified which cause delays and inaccuracies throughout the system. An algorithm that can automatically verify and classify law school outlines will allow for fast information access, increased verification/classification accuracy and reduced costs. Therefore, we have developed a machine learning algorithm that can quickly and accurately verify and classify law school outlines into six major first year law courses. We investigate both supervised (naïve Bayes) and unsupervised (K-means) learning algorithms to validate uploaded law school outlines. To address the classification problem, we have developed and tested three outline classification algorithms that encompass both supervised and unsupervised learning methodologies; multinomial naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-means. We find that our naïve Bayes based algorithms achieve perfect (100 %) classification and verification accuracy. However, we find that an unsupervised approach using k-means for both classification and verification provides a dramatic improvement in computational efficiency while only sacrificing less than 1 % in classification/verification accuracy. ...|$|R
