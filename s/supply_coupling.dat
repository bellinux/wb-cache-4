40|$|Monitoring {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of gravel bedload transport in complex braided morphologies is hampered by high spatial variability of sediment flux pathways, which respond to both local measures of flow competence and upstream sediment <b>supply.</b> <b>Coupling</b> observed morphodynamics with distributed measurements of sediment transport in braided rivers remains a key empirical research goal. For the ReesScan project on the Rees River, New Zealand, calibrated aDcp measurements of apparent bed velocity (va) will be used to: a) close a reach-scale morphological sediment budget, by monitoring bedload transport at a fixed cross-section; and b) study the coupled evolution of sediment transport pathways and short-term morphological evolution of distinct braidunits. The calibration of va {{has been based on}} concurrent va measurements and Helley-Smith bedload samples.

40|$|Recently new {{attempts}} {{had been}} made to increase the sensitivity of strain gauges. One of these attempts is to replace the metallic material by amorphous carbon deposited by PVD processes. The sensitivities reported by several authors reach more than 50 times the values which are achievable by conventional metal based strain gauges. Film-substrate interaction and long term stability are major properties of thin film s used for strain gauges. Both may be improved by use of HPPMS technology. Typically long Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) data are useful to detect long term changes in the plasma source caused by target abrasion, gas flow change or by other influences. Time resolved OES data in sub-microsecond scale may allow conclusions on the short term behavior of the plasma process in the plasma. Sub microsecond resolved OES data in comparison to discharge voltage and current data indicate the quality of power <b>supply</b> <b>coupling</b> to the plasma source. Furthermore they are useful to compare discharge conditions in different plasma source configurations. By use of a new type AO spectrometer the temporal behavior of a pulsed magnetron discharge for a-C thin film deposition was investigated. The excellent wavelength resolution of 0. 5 nm at 800 nm and 0. 05 nm at 250 nm allows access to a large number of transitions. The optical signal is collected by PMT and digitized with a time step of 20 ns. Discharges from several target materials are investigated at several plasma source configurations. The temporal behavior of the discharge is presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Conventional PLL design {{techniques}} used to implement CMOS GHz range clock recovery circuits typically suffer from significant power <b>supply</b> <b>coupled</b> noise in large integrated systems. This noise worsens the jitter of the PLL and degrades the system Bit-ErrorRate (BER).

Moreover, since this circuit works at reduced voltage swing, it {{not only has the}} potential of operating at very high frequency but also dissipates less power at high frequencies than conventional CMOS logic. Simulation results show that this clock recovery circuit can work at 1. 25 GHz with power dissipation of less than 100 mw.

At present, the conventional method of fish larviculture using live food such as Artemia nauplii is being practiced by most Malaysian catfish hatchery operators. Using expensive live food like Artemia has made the mass production of catfish fry/fingerlings less profitable. Alternative measures are necessary in order to help minimize importation and use of Artemia. Indigenous species of live food organisms, which are great potential as feed and can easily be cultured and mass-produced at low cost, may be used as substitutes.
