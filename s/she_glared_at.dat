2500|$|But {{the ladies}} of Winchester had brought some of this harsh {{treatment}} on themselves. From the very first Union occupation, they had treated Federal soldiers despicably. Going to church one Sunday, one woman accidentally dropped her Bible or prayer brook. A passing soldier immediately {{picked it up and}} offered it to her. <b>She</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> him hatefully and refused it. When the Union army was retreating through town during the First Battle of Winchester, the civilians, but most particularly the women, uttered the vilest language, hurling at them anything that came to hand. Then they began shooting from their windows or yards. Any of a number of soldiers were killed by women firing at them. One cavalryman, wounded in the foot, sat on a doorstep. The woman of the house opened the door and asked him if he could walk. [...] "No," [...] he told her. Could she see his pistol she asked. Innocently, he gave it to her. She put it to his head and told him to get off her doorstep. As he tried to limp away, she shot him in the back. That night, several young soldiers took a vow to punish the women of Winchester for murdering their comrades when they returned. This is the context within which Milroy was operating.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> me. By {{this time}} I was pure jelly. I simply flowed about the chair.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Neale an instant, white-faced and hard, and then, rejoining her companions, she {{led them}} away.|$|E
60|$|LADY CAROLINE (with itching {{fingers as}} <b>she</b> <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> Lob). It {{is all that}} wretch's doing.|$|R
5000|$|Beka is {{slender and}} tall at five feet and eight inches. She has dark-blond hair and light blue-gray eyes that unsettle people when she's mad. Someone once {{told her that}} it's like being touched by ice when <b>she</b> <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> people, though Beka herself can neither prove nor {{disprove}} this, seeing as she's never seen her face while angry ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mary Isabel," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> {{her sister}} and {{ignoring}} the doctor entirely, [...] "did you mean what you said in that letter?" ...|$|R
60|$|Willy had {{not a word}} to say. She {{sprang to}} her feet, <b>she</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> the triumphant woman in the bed, and, turning, went downstairs.|$|E
6000|$|He coloured; {{there was}} {{something}} in her passionate piety that scorched him. <b>She</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> him with tragic eyes--he might have profaned an altar. [...] "Oh I mean that nothing will come of it." ...|$|E
60|$|Aunt Em turned {{upon the}} Lion a {{determined}} countenance and a wild dilated eye. <b>She</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> the immense beast steadily, and the Lion, {{who had been}} quietly blinking at them, began to appear uneasy and disturbed.|$|E
6000|$|She {{answered}} {{as well as}} {{she could}} with the brush held horizontally in her mouth while <b>she</b> <b>glared</b> inhospitably <b>at</b> him. [...] "Well, not much," [...] and then she let him in, and went and lighted her spirit-lamp.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go 'long an' {{bring that}} stuff up here. I never {{see such a}} man in my life. It's a wonder he didn't do it f'r two bottles." [...] <b>She</b> <b>glared</b> out <b>at</b> the sign, which faced {{directly}} upon the kitchen window.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come along upstairs wid yo' Mammy, honey. Dis ain't {{no place}} for us, I reckon." [...] Her words were the essence of endearment. And yet, while she {{pronounced}} them, <b>she</b> <b>glared</b> unceasingly <b>at</b> the intruders. [...] "Oh, de good Lawd'll burn de wicked!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> him defiantly. He glared back at her. Then {{his sense}} of humour came to his rescue. She looked so absurdly small {{standing}} there with her chin up and her fists clenched. He laughed delightedly. He went {{up to her and}} placed a hand on each of her shoulders, looking down at her. He felt that he loved her for her championship of Bill.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is well, Shepherdess," [...] she answered, [...] "your will is my will, for I {{love you}} {{alone in the}} world, {{and all the rest}} I hate," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Leonard and Otter. [...] "You are my father, and my mother, and my child, and where you are, in death or in life, there is my home. Let us go then among this people of mine, there to perish miserably, so that the Deliverer may seek to glut himself with wealth.|$|E
6000|$|The next morning, at breakfast, {{though her}} mother's {{complaints}} continued, Janet was silent as to her purchase, and she lingered on her return {{home in the}} evening because she now felt a reluctance {{to appear in the}} role of protector and preserver of the family. She would have preferred, if possible, to give the stove anonymously. Not that the expression of Hannah's gratitude was maudlin; <b>she</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Janet when she entered the dining-room and exclaimed: [...] "You hadn't ought to have gone and done it!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glared</b> malevolently <b>at</b> him and hobbled on. Several minutes afterward, {{coming back}} {{from a trip to}} where a squad of groaning {{patients}} was gathering spruce-boughs, Smoke saw the seeress entering Amos Wentworth's cabin and followed after her. At the door he could hear her voice, whimpering and pleading.|$|R
50|$|One day, {{she goes}} horse riding. She goes skinny dipping, leaving her {{clothes on the}} horse, only to have it wander off, {{attracted}} by another locked in a corral. She chases after {{it all over the}} countryside. The horse is finally caught by Adam (Aribert Mog), the virile young foreman or engineer of a road construction gang. Seeing this, she hides in the bushes, where he finds her. At first, she is ashamed of her nudity, but then <b>she</b> <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> him in defiance. He gives her back her clothes. When she tries to leave, she hurts her foot. At first, she resists his efforts to help, then accedes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I just brushed my {{lips with}} it, {{and gave it}} back to him," [...] moaned Fern. <b>She</b> sat up, <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Carol. [...] "Did you ever take a drink?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{spoke of}} nothing, {{but she was}} gentle and nice; she {{seemed to want to}} help me through." [...] Which the good lady had no sooner said, however, than she almost tragically gasped at herself. <b>She</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Milly with a pretended pluck. [...] "What I mean is that she saw one had been taken up with something. When I say she knows I should say she's a person who guesses." [...] And her grimace was also, on its side, heroic. [...] "But she doesn't matter, Milly." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> him {{a little}} on this; her face {{was no longer the}} hospitable inn-front with the showy sign of the Smile. The sign had come down; she looked sharp and strained, almost old; the change was complete. It made her serious as he had never seen her—having seen her always only either too pleased or too disgusted. “Yes, I know; men are so stupid. They know nothing about women but what women tell them. And women tell them things on purpose to see how stupid they can be. I’ve told you things like that just for {{amusement}} when it was dull. If you believed them it was your own fault. But now I want you really to know.” ...|$|E
60|$|And, {{completely}} {{restored to}} good humour {{by her own}} eloquence, Elizabeth burst out laughing. It was a trait in her character which she had often lamented, {{that she could not}} succeed in keeping angry with anyone {{for more than a few}} minutes on end. Sooner or later some happy selection of a phrase of abuse would tickle her sense of humour, or the appearance of her victim would become too funny not to be laughed at. On the present occasion it was the ridiculous spectacle of Nutty cowering beneath the bedclothes that caused her wrath to evaporate. She made a weak attempt to recover it. <b>She</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Nutty, who at the sound of her laughter had emerged from under the clothes like a worm after a thunderstorm.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile {{his wife}} had craned her long lithe body forward over the bar till her head was almost level with the hither edge of the table. There <b>she</b> stood <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> him, her wicked face alive with fury and malice, for the brandy she had drunk had caused her to forget her fears.|$|R
60|$|In {{less than}} two miles the racing motor had used up so much water {{that she had to}} make four trips to the creek before she had filled the radiator. When she had climbed back on the running-board <b>she</b> <b>glared</b> down <b>at</b> spats and shoes turned into gray lumps. She was not tearful. She was angry.|$|R
6000|$|Leonard looked round. It was Soa who spoke, Soa who {{had been}} {{listening}} to their talk, and <b>she</b> was <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> him {{with an expression of}} intense hate in her sullen eyes. A thought came into his mind. [...] "Was it not possible that this woman {{had something to do with}} their misfortunes? How came it about that the others were taken while she was left?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{this point}} {{there came a}} sound from within the marquee as of skirts {{sweeping}} forward sharply, imperiously, followed by a softer frou-frou, and Mrs. Thrall put aside the curtain of the tent with one hand, and stood challenging our little Altrurian group, while Lady Moors peered timidly at us from over her mother's shoulder. I felt a lust of battle rising in me at sight of that woman, {{and it was as}} much as I could do to control myself; but in view of the bad time I knew she was going to have, I managed to hold in, though I joined very scantly in the polite greetings of the Chrysostoms and Aristides, which she ignored {{as if they had been}} the salutations of savages. <b>She</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> her husband for explanation, and he said, gently, [...] "This is a delegation from the Altrurian capital, my dear, and we have been talking over the situation together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{the meal}} was done--and I {{prolonged}} {{it as much as}} possible--I saw Hendrika was beginning to get jealous of Tota again. <b>She</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> her and then at the big knife which was tied round her own body. I knew the knife again, it was the one with which she had tried to murder you, dear. At last she {{went so far as to}} draw the knife. I was paralyzed with fear, then suddenly I remembered that when she was our servant, and used to get out of temper and sulk, I could always calm her by singing to her. So I began to sing hymns. Instantly she forgot her jealousy and put the knife back into its sheath. She knew the sound of the singing, and sat listening to it with a rapt face; the baboons, too, crowded in at the entrance of the cave to listen. I must have sung for an hour or more, all the hymns that I could remember. It was so very strange and dreadful sitting there singing to mad Hendrika and those hideous man-like apes that shut their eyes and nodded their great heads as I sang. It was a horrible nightmare; but I believe that the baboons are almost as human as the Bushmen.|$|E
6000|$|Verena {{recognised}} him; she {{had seen}} him the night before at Miss Birdseye's, and she said to her hostess, [...] "Now I must go--you have got another caller!" [...] It was Verena's belief that in the fashionable world (like Mrs. Farrinder, she thought Miss Chancellor belonged to it--thought that, in standing there, she herself was in it)--in the highest social walks it was the custom of a prior guest to depart when another friend arrived. She had been told at people's doors that she could not be received because the lady of the house had a visitor, and she had retired on these occasions with a feeling of awe much more than a sense of injury. They had not been the portals of fashion, but in this respect, she deemed, they had emulated such bulwarks. Olive Chancellor offered Basil Ransom a greeting which she believed to be consummately lady-like, and which the young man, narrating the scene several months later to Mrs. Luna, whose susceptibilities he did not feel himself obliged to consider (she considered his so little), described by saying that <b>she</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> him. Olive had thought it very possible he would come that day if he was to leave Boston; though she was perfectly mindful that she had given him no encouragement at the moment they separated. If he should not come she should be annoyed, and if he should come she should be furious; she was also sufficiently mindful of that. But she had a foreboding that, of the two grievances, fortune would confer upon her only the less; the only one she had as yet was that he had responded to her letter--a complaint rather wanting in richness. If he came, at any rate, he would be likely to come shortly before dinner, at the same hour as yesterday. He had now anticipated this period considerably, and it seemed to Miss Chancellor that he had taken a base advantage of her, stolen a march upon her privacy. She was startled, disconcerted, but as I have said, she was rigorously lady-like. She was determined not again to be fantastic, as she had been about his coming to Miss Birdseye's. The strange dread associating itself with that was something which, she devoutly trusted, she had felt once for all. She didn't know what he could do to her; he hadn't prevented, on the spot though he was, one of the happiest things that had befallen her for so long--this quick, confident visit of Verena Tarrant. It was only just at the last that he had come in, and Verena must go now; Olive's detaining hand immediately relaxed itself.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Wix, at this, pounced upon it; she {{had grabbed}} it too soon even for Maisie {{to become aware}} of being rather afraid of it. Thrusting it {{instantly}} behind her <b>she</b> positively <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Sir Claude. [...] "See it, wretched man?--the innocent child SEE such a thing? I think you must be mad, and she shall not have a glimpse of it while I'm here to prevent!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "While some fighters strike an impassive pose … Rousey {{is nothing}} if not expressive. She smiles often, squinting so tightly that her eyes disappear. She cries easily, a girlhood habit she never outgrew. And before each fight <b>she</b> <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> her {{opponent}} as if she were getting ready to put a permanent end to a lifelong feud. After the fight, she is all smiles again, and usually unblemished." [...] - The New Yorker, 2014 In a 2012 interview before her first match with Miesha Tate, Ronda Rousey said [...] "When I was doing judo my main advantage was my conditioning and my pace; I used to wear people out." [...] She had taken to heart a quote from Ryoko Tani to fight every five seconds as if it was the last five seconds of the match.|$|R
6000|$|My brother read aloud, [...] "The 3rd of February, 1836," [...] then {{he turned}} to my father and said, [...] "You observe, father, the {{difference}} this may make, if true, is that of putting little Alured into the place I have held. My father's last marriage was on the 15th of April, 1836," [...] he added to her. He says <b>she</b> quite <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> him with mortification, as if he had invented poor little Alured on purpose to baffle her; but my father breathed more freely.|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} all summer working hard in town and then had gone down to Folkestone for a blow. Art was long, I felt, and my holiday short; my mother was settled at Folkestone, and I paid her a visit when I could. I {{remember}} how on this occasion, after weeks in my stuffy studio with my nose on my palette, I sniffed up the clean salt air and cooled my eyes with the purple sea. The place was full of lodgings, and the lodgings were at that season full of people, people who {{had nothing to do}} but to stare at one another on the great flat down. There were thousands of little chairs and almost as many little Jews; and there was music in an open rotunda, over which the little Jews wagged their big noses. We all strolled to and fro and took pennyworths of rest; the long, level cliff- top, edged in places with its iron rail, might have been the deck of a huge crowded ship. There were old folks in Bath chairs, and there was one dear chair, creeping to its last full stop, by the side of which I always walked. There was in fine weather the coast of France to look at, and there were the usual things to say about it; there was also in every state of the atmosphere our friend Mrs. Meldrum, a subject of remark not less inveterate. The widow of an officer in the Engineers, she had settled, like many members of the martial miscellany, well within sight of the hereditary enemy, who however had left her leisure to form in spite of the difference of their years a close alliance with my mother. She was the heartiest, the keenest, the ugliest of women, the least apologetic, the least morbid in her misfortune. She carried it high aloft with loud sounds and free gestures, made it flutter in the breeze {{as if it had been}} the flag of her country. It consisted mainly of a big red face, indescribably out of drawing, from which <b>she</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> you through gold-rimmed aids to vision, optic circles of such diameter and so frequently displaced that some one had vividly spoken of her as flattering her nose against the glass of her spectacles. She was extraordinarily near-sighted, and whatever they did to other objects they magnified immensely the kind eyes behind them. Blest conveniences they were, in their hideous, honest strength--they showed the good lady everything in the world but her own queerness. This element was enhanced by wild braveries of dress, reckless charges of colour and stubborn resistances of cut, wondrous encounters in which the art of the toilet seemed to lay down its life. She had the tread of a grenadier and the voice of an angel.|$|E
5000|$|When the war ended, Cannon {{began to}} produce live magic shows using two assistants, Joyce and Rhonda Deronda (born Joyce and Eleanor Robson), who helped with performances. One act {{involved}} putting Rhonda into a hypnotic trance to diagnose {{physical and psychological}} problems, as <b>she</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> the patient. Some of his apparently magical techniques were exposed in 1952 by David Norris.|$|E

6000|$|She drew a long breath. Once more {{her face}} was at any rate human. The {{lightning}} filled {{the room with a}} sudden <b>glare.</b> <b>She</b> caught <b>at</b> him with a scream. [...] "Oh! I am afraid, I am afraid!" [...] she moaned.|$|R
60|$|Throughout this {{frivolous}} talk (I only {{venture to}} report it because it shows that I bore no malice on my side) Miss Melbury was looking at us like the basilisk of the ancients. She owned to being {{on the wrong side}} of thirty; and she had a little money--but these were surely no reasons why <b>she</b> should <b>glare</b> <b>at</b> a poor governess. Had some secret understanding of the tender sort been already established between Mr. Sax and herself? She provoked me into trying to find out--especially as the last words he had said offered me the opportunity.|$|R
60|$|Malbihn {{remained}} scowling and angry. He {{replied to}} Jenssen's friendly advances in curt monosyllables. To Meriem {{he did not}} speak, but on several occasions <b>she</b> discovered him <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> her from beneath half closed lids--greedily. The look sent a shudder through her. She hugged Geeka closer to her breast and doubly regretted the knife that they had taken from {{her when she was}} captured by Kovudoo.|$|R
