5000|$|In 1884 {{he founded}} (with Friedrich Chrysander and Philipp Spitta) the Vierteljahresschrift für Musikwissenschaft (Musicology Quarterly). Adler {{provided}} {{the first article}} of the first issue, [...] "Umfang, Methode und Ziel der Musikwissenschaft" [...] ("The <b>Scope,</b> <b>Method,</b> and Aim of Musicology", 1885), which not only constitutes the first attempt at a comprehensive description {{of the study of}} music, but also famously divides the discipline into two subdisciplines, historische Musikwissenschaft (historical musicology) and systematische Musikwissenschaft ("systematic musicology"). In Adler's article, systematic musicology included Musikologie or vergleichende Musikwissenschaft (comparative musicology), which later became an independent discipline (cf. ethnomusicology). Although these subfields do not exactly line up with current practice, they are roughly maintained in modern European musicology and roughly correspond to the North American division of musicology into music history (often called [...] "musicology"), music theory, and ethnomusicology.|$|E

40|$|Background National minimum {{standards}} for residential care homes were introduced following the Care Standards Act 2000 {{in response to}} concern {{about the lack of}} consistency and poor quality services. These standards are intended to reflect outcomes for service users and to be comprehensive in <b>scope.</b> <b>Method</b> This study compared ratings made by care standards inspectors with research measures for 52 homes for people with intellectual disabilities serving 299 people. The research measures focused on the lived experience of residential care, including engagement in meaningful activity, choice and participation in activities of daily living. They also included measures of related care practices and organizational arrangements. Results The research measures were in general significantly correlated with each other. Most of the care standards ratings were also correlated with each other. However, only two of 108 correlations between care standards and research measures were significant. Possible reasons for this are discussed.

40|$|Preimplantation genetic {{diagnosis}} (PGD) was first reported as successful in humans {{in the early}} 1990 s and nearly two decades later the psychological impact of PGD {{has not yet been}} clearly defined. As PGD requires the use of IVF, this paper provides a brief summary of literature related to the various psychological aspects of IVF followed by {{a review of the literature}} related to the psychological and broader psychosocial impact of PGD. The current literature includes attitudinal studies of couples for whom PGD may be beneficial and results suggest that those with traumatic reproductive and genetic histories are more likely to find PGD an acceptable treatment option. A small number of studies have used samples of women and couples who have used PGD. Due to a general lack of homogeneity in <b>scope,</b> <b>method</b> and results, these studies have not provided a uniform understanding of the PGD experience. Promisingly, however, two studies on parents of children born after PGD that explored parental stress show no differences between PGD, IVF and natural conception couples. The paper concludes that the missing link in the literature is a prospective study of PGD using validated psychological scales. Suggestions for future research are provided. 9 page(s...|$|E

The problems existing in the grass-root agricultural technology promotion {{in the process of}} new village construction are analyzed as follows: the awareness of innovation is not strong; scientific research, education, and promotion are disjointed; the construction of specific work system lags behind; me structure of promotion team is irrational, and the quality of promotion personnel is yet to be promoted; the cultural quality of farmers is low, and the cooperative organizations are not sound; the working conditions are poor, and the basic security is inadequate; the investment channel is simple and the supply amount is badly short; the methods of agricultural technology promotion do not adapt to the requirements of new situation.

In their poetic works on Mandela, isiXhosa poets present various aspects of this figure. These aspects include Mandela’s background, physical appearance, personality, praise names and how isiXhosa poets associate him with other figures. These poets also employ a number of figures of speech and repetitive devices in their poetry. These devices add clarity to the meaning of the poetry on Nelson Mandela. All this is discussed in the chapters tabulated below: Chapter one will introduce the study by highlighting its aim, <b>scope,</b> <b>method</b> of research, explaining the concepts of stylistics and style, and the significance of the study. Chapter two will deal with the main aspects of Mandela’s life that are presented in isiXhosa poetry. These aspects include Mandela’s background, his physical appearance, personality traits, deeds, praise names and Mandela associated with other figures. Chapter three will focus on the figures of speech that are used in the depiction of Mandela in isiXhosa poetry. These figures of speech include simile, metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism and idioms. Chapter four will concentrate on the repetitive techniques that are employed by isiXhosa poets in the poetry on Nelson Rholihlahla Mandela.

40|$|BUZZING is a {{pilot project}} which {{introduces}} {{a new way of}} working with disengaged and long-term unemployed young people (aged 15 to 24 years) to support their transition into employment using gamification and online platforms to drive engagement. The project is funded by the Australian Government’s Department of Employment under their Empowering YOUth Initiatives, and delivered by not-for-profit organisation United Synergies. This article gives focus to the design considerations that underpin the work of an internal evaluator working on the BUZZING project, and enrolled in an evaluation unit within a postgraduate course. The step-by-step process used to create an evaluation plan inclusive of purpose, context, <b>scope,</b> <b>method</b> and methodology are illustrated, supported by evidence-based justifications. Furthermore, counterbias design considerations such as a mix of different methodology inquiry, data sources and researchers (triangulation) are discussed and recommendations given for an ethical evaluation framework. The practice of using evidence-based rigour in evaluation is promoted for organisations which seek to demonstrate positive social change within complex environments. The capacity building and professional development of internal evaluators in the not-for-profit sector is therefore recommended to drive accountability, ethical practices and continual improvement for public good from within the organisation. Finally, White’s (2009) theory-based impact evaluation is adopted as the evaluation method as it maps out the causal chain from inputs to outcomes and impact, testing the underlying assumptions to understand why a program has, or has not, had an impact...|$|E

40|$|The {{academic}} community has since joined the KM bandwagon {{set in motion}} by management consultancy firms and information practitioners. A number of members of the academia and researchers have clamored and are still clamoring for individuals and organizations to view KM as an emerging field, to embrace it, and benefit from its numerous advantages. Yet the nature, <b>scope</b> <b>method,</b> and validity aspects of KM remain ill defined. In fact there is no consensus regarding the claim that KM is a new field with its own research base, since much of the terminology and techniques used, such as knowledge mapping, seem to have been borrowed from both IM and librarianship. The discrepancy has ranged from authors who see KM as an emerging discipline, to others who claim that firms and information professionals have been practicing KM-related activities for years, and to those who insists {{that there is no such}} thing as KM. In this study, the concept of KM is examined in the Web sites of leading business schools. A few cases were identified through a literature search of ABI Inform and the Internet. Each case was reviewed and details of each area of interest were extracted and recorded. The data were compared and analyzed. Secondly, in addition, to the review of journal publications on KM, a survey of experienced academicians was conducted to understand what KM means to them, and KM initiatives in their faculties, departments, or units.

This {{study is}} a {{critical}} assessment and analysis of Xhosa poetry that addresses social and political concerns with particular reference to the poetry of Qangule (1970), Mtuze (1982, 1990) and Xozwa (1994). Chapter one introduces the study by presenting its aim, <b>scope,</b> <b>method</b> of research, theory, definition of concepts and significance of the study. Chapter 2 focuses on the theoretical framework of the study. It discusses the theory of Marxism, which {{is used as a}} basis of this study, by explaining the concept of Marxism, its historical background, assumptions, methodology and Marxism and poetry. Chapter 3 deals with social concerns that are addressed by Mtuze (1982 and 1990) and Xozwa (1994). These social concerns are divorce and alcohol usage. The discussion in this chapter focuses on how divorce affects members of the family concerned, especially children of divorced parents. It also looks at how alcohol is used in society. While the discussion in this chapter acknowledges moderate use of alcohol, it focuses more on how this substance may also be abused. It looks at how alcohol abuse affects individuals and society economically and how dangerous it is to the health and lives of people. Chapter 4 focuses on political concerns as addressed by Qangule (1970) and Mtuze (1982). It assesses and analyses poems that address the oppression of black people during the apartheid regime in South Africa. Concerns like citizenship and deprivation of freedom, labour conditions and language are discussed in this chapter.
