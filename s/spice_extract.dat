40|$|The {{composition}} of apple base wine {{was found to}} be suitable for conversion into vermouth. The <b>spices</b> <b>extract</b> contained more TSS, tannins, esters, volatile acid but lower titrable acid than apple base wine. To optimize and develop apple vermouth with different ethanol concentrations (12 %, 15 %, 18 %), sugar content (4 %, 8 %) and <b>spices</b> <b>extract</b> (2. 5 % and 5. 0 %) was prepared and was evaluated. Significant differences in physico-chemical characteristics and sensory quality amongst the vermouths having different levels of alcohol, sugar and <b>spices</b> <b>extract</b> were noted. Generally, increasing ethanol content decreased titrable acidity, tannins, macroelements and colour units while micro-elements, viscosity and total esters were increased. Increased sugar level affected TSS, apparent viscosity, pH, esters, free aldehyde, total sugar, K, Cu and Mn contents. Level of <b>spices</b> <b>extract</b> (2. 5 & 5. 0) did not effect TSS (ºB), titrable acidity, colour, total sugar, total tannins, volatile acidity, increased mineral contents except for K, esters and aldehyde contents. Increase in alcohol content upto 15 % increased the sensory score of the product. Increased quantity of <b>spices</b> <b>extract,</b> however, decreased the mean sensory quality of vermouth. However, sensory scores for 4 or 8 % sugar and 2. 5 or, 5. 0 % <b>spices</b> <b>extracted</b> were similar.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for safe and {{convenient}} meat products. The effect of natural <b>spice</b> <b>extracts</b> incorporated with other hurdles for controlling pathogenic bacteria and extending the shelf life of RTE doner kebab were investigated. A comprehensive literature review was undertaken to establish the status of microbial risk, use of additives, knowledge on oxidative deterioration and HACCP associated with meat products. The in vitro antioxidant and antibacterial activities of <b>spice</b> <b>extracts</b> were screened and compared. Cinnamon, clove, and sumac alcoholic extracts demonstrated strong antimicrobial effect, however, rosemary proved effective as antioxidant in a lamb fat model. An accelerated shelf life study on a model system indicated that storage temperature was the most critical factor affecting lipid oxidation, which was effectively delayed by vacuum packaging and rosemary extracts. The effects of <b>spice</b> <b>extracts,</b> packaging and storage time on physiochemical, microbiological, and sensory attributes of doner kebab were evaluated. Application of rosemary and cinnamon extracts significantly reduced TVC, inhibited LAB, and retarded lipid oxidation rate. Sensory evaluation by a consumer panel indicated that only taste and spiciness perception was significantly different between treatments. A challenge test against Listeria monocytogenes showed significant differences between control and spice treatments at day 28. Strong inhibitory effects were associated {{to high levels of}} cinnamon particularly when applied after cooking. The effect of heat treatment and sumac (Rhus coriaria) on Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens inactivation was evaluated on a doner kebab prototype. Addition of sumac significantly reduced D-values and z-values for both organisms in comparison to the control. The investigation of the effect of <b>spice</b> <b>extracts,</b> and environmental conditions on changes in growth kinetic parameters for L. monocytogenes and Salmonella Typhimurium showed that <b>spice</b> <b>extracts</b> are highly significant.

40|$|Total {{equivalent}} antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and phenolic {{content of}} 26 common <b>spice</b> <b>extracts</b> from 12 botanical families were investigated. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of major phenolics in the <b>spice</b> <b>extracts</b> were systematically conducted by reversed-phase {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (RP-HPLC). Many spices contained high levels of phenolics and demonstrated high antioxidant capacity. Wide variation in TEAC values (0. 55 - 168. 7 mmol/ 100 g) and total phenolic content (0. 04 - 14. 38 g of gallic acid equivalent/ 100 g) was observed. A highly positive linear relationship (R 2 = 0. 95) obtained between TEAC values and total phenolic content showed that phenolic compounds in the tested spices contributed significantly to their antioxidant capacity. Major types of phenolic constituents identified in the <b>spice</b> <b>extracts</b> were phenolic acids, phenolic diterpenes, flavonoids, and volatile oils (e. g., aromatic compounds). Rosmarinic acid was the dominant phenolic compound in the six spices of the family Labiatae. Phenolic volatile oils were the principal active ingredients in most spices. The spices and related families with the highest antioxidant capacity were screened, e. g., clove in the Myrtaceae, cinnamon in the Lauraceae, oregano in the Labiatae, etc., representing potential sources of potent natural antioxidants for commercial exploitation.

Although the medicinal benefits of oregano, such as the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities, are well known; nonetheless, only few data are available on its effect in cancer prevention, especially concerning the mechanism of action. Here, we investigated the effect of Origanum vulgare ethanolic extracts on redox balance, cell proliferation, and cell death in colon adenocarcinoma Caco 2 cells. Oregano extract leads to growth arrest and cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Changes in glutathione content, as well as the increase in its oxidized form, may be involved in oregano-triggered death. Both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways appear to be activated by <b>spice</b> <b>extract.</b> Our findings suggest that oregano amounts found in the Mediterranean diet can exert proapoptotic effects, which are selective for cancer cells.

40|$|Genetic data {{argues that}} Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can be {{initiated}} by aggregates of a 42 amino acid beta amyloid peptide (AB 42). The AB aggregates, notably small oligomer species, cause {{a cascade of}} events including oxidative damage, inflammation, synaptic toxicity and accumulation of intraneuronal inclusions; notably neurofibrillary tangles. Cognitive deficits are likely {{to begin with a}} failure of synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity with dendritic spine loss and dying back of dendritic arbor. This is followed by neuron loss in key areas involved in learning and memory. Significant prevention or delay of clinical onset may be achievable by modifying environmental risk factors that impact the underlying pathogenic pathways. Because low fish intake and low blood levels of the marine lipid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been associated with increased AD risk we have tested the impact of depleting or supplementing with dietary DHA on AD pathogenesis in transgenic mice bearing a mutant human gene known to cause AD in people. We reported that even with intervention late in life dietary DHA depletion dramatically enhanced oxidative damage and the loss of dendritic markers, while DHA supplementation markedly reduced AB 42 accumulation and oxidative damage, corrected many synaptic deficits and improved cognitive function. Loss of brain DHA was exacerbated in mice expressing the mutant human AD transgene, this is consistent with evidence for increased oxidative attack on DHA oxidation in AD. Treatment with the curry <b>spice</b> <b>extract</b> curcumin, a polyphenolic antioxidant that inhibits AP aggregation, has been strongly protective in the same mouse model. Many Western diets are typically deficient in DHA and low in polyphenolic antioxidant intake.

40|$|Abstract Antioxidant {{properties}} of green tea (GT) {{have been widely}} reported. The antioxidant capacity (AOC) of green tea was investigated to include the effect of infusion time over 24 hours. The AOC {{was measured by the}} FRAP, DPPH, TEAC, and CBA assays. It was proven according that after 2 hours of brewing, tea has higher AOC and Total phenolic content (TPC), these significantly decreases after 4 hours. GT has a high amount of polyphenols with potent AOC. However, interactions between polyphenols and food matrix may decrease their potential benefit. The objective of this experiment was to test the hypothesis that the addition of milk (full fat, semi-skimmed, and skimmed) may affect the phenolic content and AOC was measured. The results indicated the plain GT had highest activity; then tea with FFM had a significantly higher amount of AO than others. Plant extracts possess health promoting properties. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the TPC and AOA of different concentrations of spice extracts (fennel, clove, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, anise, and black pepper) with DPPH, TEAC and Rancimat methods. At low concentration, black pepper had a highest activity but at high concentration, ginger showed the highest activity among the extracts. The TPC for <b>spice</b> <b>extract</b> was greater for anise. Results provided evidence that the studied spices may be used as a natural AO. In recent decades, saliva has emerged as a new way to diagnose and investigate basic health problems. In this study, salivary TPC and AOC were measured after consumption a single cup of green tea with and without of milk. In a healthy adult crossover design. The salivary AOC and TPC were measured before and after consumption up to 3 hours. Results indicated that milk decreased AOC of GT when compared with the control water. The activity reached peak 1 hour after ingestion and then decreased returning to the baseline. Results confirmed that saliva could be used as an easier and safer alternative to blood to assess AOA in humans...|$|E
40|$|Fresh produce linked {{foodborne}} outbreaks {{have become}} a global concern. Nutritional value of vegetables and high prices of meat and meat originated food compel common people for consumption of plant originated food particularly salad vegetables. Microbial population of vegetable surfaces contains large number of pathogenic bacteria including members of Enterobactereace. Most promising pathogen among enteric microbes is Escherichia coli (E. coli) that is normally a nonpathogenic bacteria and becomes virulent due to several pathogenic factors like toxin production. Shigalike toxins are chief disease causing molecular structures produced by Shigalike toxin producing strains of E. coli possessing genes for shigalike toxin I and shigalike toxin II. It was intended to assess and manage the risk associated with these potential pathogens. This research {{was an effort to}} reduce faecal contamination of salad vegetables consumed in Pakistan and to provide clean nutritious food to public. A survey was conducted in three markets of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore and tomato, lettuce, cabbage and cucumber were collected from three shops of each market. Each vegetable was analysed as unwashed and washed for aeobic plate count (APC), total coliforms, faecal coliforms and E. coli. About two hundred and fifty E. coli isolates were preserved, serotyped and studied for presence of shigalike toxin genes. Results indicated a high APC on all vegetable samples. Total coliforms, faecal coliforms and E. coli count exceeded the permissible limits in most samples. Highest APC was associated with lettuce (6. 6 log 10 cfu/g). Tomato was least contaminated by APC (5. 6 log 10 cfu/g). E. coli was detected in tomato, lettuce, cucumber and cabbage. Washed samples showed significantly reduced bacterial population. Two hundred and fifty isolates of E. coli were biochemically characterized and serotyped for O and H antigens. Majority of strains could not be identified by serotyping. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results indicated presence of shigalike toxins in 55 E. coli isolates. Raw garlic proved to be most promising antibacterial <b>spice</b> <b>extract</b> with maximum zone of inhibition (29 mm) and lowest MIC (3 mg/ml). Ginger, cinnamon, mustard also indicated considerable antibacterial activity. Extracts prepared by using methanol, acetone and water as solvents showed variable antimicrobial efficiency. Solvent extraction reduced efficacy of extracts as compared to crude extracts. Acetic acid, citric acid and common salt also lowered growth of E. coli strains. A treatment solution of pH= 2. 7, consisting of 5 ml of raw extracts of garlic, ginger, mustard, cinnamon, 5 ml of 2 % acetic acid, 2 % citric acid and 1. 5 % common salt was prepared and directly applied on salad vegetables. This composite treatment solution significantly reduced APC and completely eliminated total coliforms, faecal coliforms and E. coli. These findings conclude with high potentially pathogenic microbial load on salad vegetables and urge for preventive action on priority basis. Raw spice extracts alongwith non toxic chemicals provide an excellent source for pathogens elimination from fresh produce...|$|E
