40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] bibliographyObjective: To facilitate knowledge synthesis and implementation of evidence supporting early physical activity and mobilization of adult patients {{in the intensive care}} unit and its translation into practice, we developed an evidence-based clinical management algorithm. Methods: Twenty-eight draft algorithm statements extracted from the extant literature by the primary research team were verified and rated by scientist clinicians (n¼ 7) in an electronic three round Delphi process. Algorithm statements which reached a priori defined consensus – <b>semi-interquartile</b> <b>range</b> < 0. 5 – were collated into the algorithm. Results: The draft algorithm statements were edited and six additional statements were formulated. The 34 statements related to assessment and treatment were grouped into three categories. Category A included statements for unconscious critically ill patients; Category B included statements for stable and cooperative critically ill patients, and Category C included statements related to stable patients with prolonged critical illness. While panellists reached consensus on the ratings of 94 % (32 / 34) of the algorithm statements, only 50 % (17 / 34) of the statements were rated essential.

40|$|Roux-en-Y gastric {{bypass surgery}} (RYGB) is {{effective}} for weight loss, but is {{commonly associated with}} iron deficiency and its clinical manifestation, anemia. Diagnosing iron deficiency is complex because iron status depends on other nutrients; additionally, anemia following surgery is not specifically due to deficiency in iron, {{as it can be}} due to deficiencies in other nutrients including zinc, copper, vitamin B 6, folate, and vitamin B 12. In patients who have undergone RYGB, our aims were to 1) conduct a comprehensive assessment of nutrients involved in iron homeostasis, 2) determine the contribution of dietary intake to iron deficiency, and 3) describe associations between anemia and nutritional status of iron and other nutrients. Systemic measures of hemoglobin, ferritin, serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), copper (Cu), vitamins B 6 and B 12, folate, zinc (Zn), and C–reactive protein (CRP) were determined using reference methods. Iron deficiency equaled having ≥ 2 abnormalities in: ferritin, sTfR, sTfR:ferritin, or TIBC. Ferritin, a measure of iron stores, was defined as normal (ferritin ≥ 20 mcg/L) or low (ferritin 3 ̆c 20 mcg/L). Statistics included prevalence, mean ± standard error of the mean (s. e. m.) for normally–distributed data, median ± <b>semi-interquartile</b> <b>range</b> for skewed data (indicated with an asterisk [*]), frequency tables, t–tests (independent, by group), correlations, and general linear models (significant if p 3 ̆c 0. 05).

40|$|The {{uncertainty}} relation {{in quantum}} mechanics is traditionally written in terms of mean as the {{measure of central tendency}} and standard deviation as the measure of dispersion. It puts a constraint on the product of the spreads of position and momentum of quantum states, a feature that is absent in classical mechanics. Based on a different statistical concept, namely the median, we propose a quantum uncertainty relation between the <b>semi-interquartile</b> <b>ranges</b> of the position and momentum distributions of arbitrary quantum states, going beyond the mean-based uncertainty. We find that unlike the mean-based uncertainty relation, the median-based one is not saturated for Gaussian distributions in position. Instead, the Cauchy distributions in position {{turn out to be the}} most classical among the distributions that we have studied.

40|$|Background: The study {{objective}} was to obtain consensus on physical therapy (PT) in the rehabilitation of critical illness survivors after hospital discharge. Research questions were: what are PT goals, what are recommended measurement tools, and what constitutes an optimal PT intervention for survivors of critical illness? Methods: A Delphi consensus study was conducted. Panelists were included based on relevant fields of expertise, years of clinical experience, and publication record. A literature review determined five themes, forming the basis for Delphi round one, which was aimed at generating ideas. Statements were drafted and ranked on a 5 -point Likert scale in two additional rounds with the objective to reach consensus. Results were expressed as median and <b>semi-interquartile</b> <b>range,</b> with the consensus threshold set at ≤ 0. 5. Results: Ten internationally established researchers and clinicians participated in this Delphi panel, with {{a response rate of}} 80 %, 100 %, and 100 % across three rounds. Consensus was reached on 88. 5 % of the statements, resulting in a framework for PT after hospital discharge. Essential handover information should include information on 15 parameters. A core set of outcomes should test exercise capacity, skeletal muscle strength, function in activities of daily living, mobility, quality of life, and pain. PT interventions should include functional exercises, circuit and endurance training, strengthening exercises for limb and respiratory muscles, education on recovery, and a nutritional component. Screening tools to identify impairments in other health domains and referral to specialists are proposed. Conclusions: A consensus-based framework for optimal PT after hospital discharge is proposed. Future research should focus on feasibility testing of this framework, developing risk stratification tools and validating core outcome measures for ICU survivors...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} biochemical markers in the synovial fluid of osteoarthritic and contralateral equine joints and gross articular cartilage pathology. Design Twenty-two horses underwent bilateral arthroscopy of their carpal or metacarpophalangeal joints following recent onset lameness. The degree of cartilage damage in each joint was scored and synovial fluid, from both the clinically affected and the contralateral joint, was collected. Bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), 5 D 4 epitope of keratan sulphate (KS), total glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and hyaluronan (HA) were measured. Results The {{mean age of the}} horses was 4. 1 years and the maximum duration of lameness was three months. Joints examined were midcarpal, antebrachiocarpal and metacarpophalangeal. The median concentration (<b>semi-interquartile</b> <b>range)</b> of BAP was significantly higher in the clinically active joint than in the contralateral joint, 21. 75 (6. 22) vs. 12. 35 (4. 07) units, while the other biomarkers measured were significantly lower in the clinically active joint than in the contralateral joint, i. e. KS 8. 79 (1. 96) μg/ml vs. 16. 39 (5. 65) μg/ml, KS:GAG ratio 0. 19 (0. 04) vs. 0. 31 (0. 10) and HA 741. 6 (222) μg/ml vs. 1061. 75 (325) μg/ml. BAP was positively (R= 0. 57), and KS (R=− 0. 57) and KS:GAG ratio (R=− 0. 49) were negatively correlated to the degree of cartilage damage within the joint. Conclusion The correlation between articular cartilage damage and synovial fluid BAP and KS imparts validity to their potential use as non-invasive diagnostic aids in equine osteoarthritis (OA). The positive correlation between BAP and cartilage damage suggests that there is a link between bone turnover and cartilage damage in OA...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the instantaneous star formation rates (SFRs) and extinction properties {{for a large}} (N = 274), near-infrared (NIR: 2. 2 μm) + mid-infrared (MIR: 24 μm) -selected sample of normal to ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs; 10 ^ 9 < L_(IR) /L_☉ < 10 ^(12. 5)) with〈 z〉~ 0. 8 in the Spitzer Extragalactic First Look Survey (FLS). We combine 24 μm observations with high-resolution Keck DEIMOS spectroscopy to derive optical emission-line (Hα, Hβ, and [O II]) and infrared star formation rates (SFR_(opt) and SFR_(IR), respectively). Comparison of SFR diagnostics reveals a wide extinction range (1. 0 < A_V < 4. 0 mag) for this sample, even after removing spectroscopic and IRAC color-selected AGN candidates (≈ 12 % of the sample). Objects with SFRs of a few M_☉ yr^(- 1) have extinction values consistent with normal spirals (A_V ≈ 1. 0 mag). By contrast, LIRGs at z ≳ 1, which comprise a fraction of our sample, have SFR ≈ 100 M_☉ yr^(- 1) and a mean A_V ≈ 2. 5 mag. This translates to a 97 % mean [O II] λλ 3727 attentuation and in extreme cases {{is as high as}} 99. 7 %. We derive an IR-luminosity-dependent A^(IR) _V function [A^(IR) _V = 0. 75 log(L_(IR) /L_☉) - 6. 35 mag] that we use to extinction correct our line luminosities. The resulting correlation between SFR_(IR) and SFR_(opt) has a dispersion of ~ 0. 2 dex (<b>semi-interquartile</b> <b>range).</b> Comparison of the A_V dependence on redshift and LIR reveals that for a fixed L_(IR), there is no significant AV evolution. Comparison to previous studies reveals a mean attenuation that is intermediate between that of local optical/UV- and radio-selected samples with a marginally stronger L_(IR) dependence...|$|E
