40|$|Abstract. At {{the steel}} plant of Höganäs Sweden AB, {{different}} steel grades were produced using an Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF). The slag tapped by the EAF often disintegrated during cooling. Slag fines from the disintegration {{are difficult to}} handle and to use as materials in construction. The plant tests of EAF slag treatments using stabilizer MCP-F of high P 2 O 5 content were thus conducted, with 1 st and 2 nd campaign adding 10 and 20 kg MCP-F/ton slag, respectively. The MCP-F addition in <b>slag</b> <b>pots</b> and other test operations were carried out smoothly, without impacting the EAF steel production. Rates P 2 O 5 recovery in the EAF slag were lower in some test heats. Studies may thus be carried out in future to increase the P 2 O 5 recovery from MCP-F, hence, achieving a higher efficiency of stabilization treatments for the slag from the EAF plant...|$|R

According to the {{new kind}} of the upper arm {{mechanism}} of the <b>slag</b> <b>pot</b> carrier, optimization design, simulation and experimental research are carried out, in which the combination of conventional design, three dimensional virtual design and experimental study are applied. The motion law of multi-segment arc slide way of main arm is given by means of researching the motion process of slag ladle in the main arm slide way. The functional relationship among the internal parameters of the arm mechanism, and between load force and arm movement is revealed by studying kinematics of mechanism and dynamics law of the upper arm mechanism. The finite element analysis of the upper arm mechanism is carried out to get the weak links of structure strength, and then the improvement solution is proposed. After experiments, the method correctness of optimization and design of upper arm mechanism is testified by the coincidence of the trial results and experimentation results...|$|E
40|$|Slags from {{non-ferrous}} metallurgy are Fe rich, with Si {{as a minor}} constituent, {{and with}} low levels of Al. Due to variations in the slag cooling practice, they can exist as semi-amorphous or as crystalline solids. Considering that both higher Al in the slag and a higher cooling rate during solidification would {{have an impact on the}} availability of Al and ultimately on the formation of linkages in the inorganic polymer, we study the microstructure and reactivity of a Fe and Al rich slag cooled in different ways. Results show that high cooling rates lead to a predominantly amorphous material. For lower cooling rates the content of amorphous phase varies from 52 wt. % to 12 wt. %. Spinel is the primary phase precipitating, whereas, for the lowest cooling rate investigated, pyroxenes form as well. Dissolution tests in a 10 M NaOH solution for 96 h reveal that approx. 54 wt. % of Al and 33 wt. % of Si of the total content become available for the highly amorphous slag. On the contrary, the dissolved Al and Si are below 5 wt. % when <b>slag</b> <b>pot</b> cooling is applied. The above strongly influence the resulting inorganic polymers with the ones originating from the amorphous slag being superior in mechanical properties. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the odor}} {{compounds}} emitted {{from the field}} workplaces at the Pohang steel complex were measured using analytical instruments and the olfactory method. In addition, the reduction of odor emissions by pyroligneous liquid was evaluated. The odor samples were obtained from slag pots and dry pits, which refrigerate hot slag, and the target compounds were hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) and ammonia (NH₃). The levels of odor emissions varied with meteorological and operating conditions, but emissions from dry pits were always much higher than those from slag pots. As the concentration of pyroligneous liquid increased, the concentrations of H₂S and the ratios of dilution decreased. Together with this result and the guideline of odor emissions, the increase of pyroligneous liquid (more than 2. 5 times) in cooling water was suggested to reduce odor emissions. Actually, the reduced levels of H₂S at the <b>slag</b> <b>pot</b> and the dry pit were observed (70 and 94 %, respectively) after the increased amount of pyroligneous liquid. However, {{in order to determine}} the optimal amount of pyroligneous liquid for the economical and efficient removal of odor emissions, the system of cooling water has to be improved and more samples are required for a comprehensive analysis. 본 연구에서는 공기희석관능법과 기기분석법을 이용하여 포항철강공단의 야외 작업장에서 배출되는 악취를 측정하고, 목초액 농도의 변화에 따른 악취배출 저감효과를 확인하였다. 연구대상 시설은 고온의 슬래그를 냉각하는 slag와 dry pit였으며, 주요 악취물질인 황화수소(H₂S) 와 암모니아(NH₃) 를 분석하였다. 악취배출은 기상 및 작업조건에 따라서 많은 차이가 있었으며, slag pot보다는 dry pit에서 고농도의 황화수소가 배출되었다. 목초액 농도가 증가함에 따라 황화수소와 공기희석배수는 감소하므로 목초액의 악취저감 효과를 정량적으로 확인할 수 있었다. 이 결과와 악취배출 규제농도를 함께 고려하여, 목초액 투입량을 2. 5 배 이상 증가시킬 것을 제안하였다. 실제로 목초액 투입량을 증가시킨 이후에 악취배출 저감효과(slag pot: 74 %, dry pti: 94 %) 를 확인할 수 있었다. 보다 경제적이고 악취저감에 효율적인 목초액 투입량을 산정하기 위해서는, 냉각수 순환시스템을 개선하고 일정한 기상 및 작업조건 하에서 보다 많은 시료채취를 통한 종합적인 추가 연구가 요구된다. clos...|$|E

Total production when the French subsidiary, GTS Industries, is included is well over two million tonnes of heavy plate annually, in a thickness range extending from 6 to 440 mm, making the company Europe's largest heavy plate producer. This robust material {{is used for}} fabrication of drilling rigs, ships, petrochemicals plants, bridges and heavy machinery; reference projects include the Öresund Bridge and the Millau Viaduct, the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, and the luxury liner, Queen Mary 2. The striking arc of the Olympic Stadium in Athens was also welded from plate supplied by Dillinger Hütte. The main application for Dillinger Hütte's heavy plate output, however, is the making of large-caliber line pipe for major pipeline projects. The so-called thermomechanical rolling process, an extremely sophisticated rolling method which permits attainment of maximized mechanical properties combined with optimum working (bending and welding) characteristics, is used for these products. Dillinger Hütte is also a 50% owner of Europipe GmbH, Europe's largest manufacturer of large-caliber line pipe, with facilities in Germany, France and the USA.|$|R

40|$|Gasification is a {{flexible}} technology which is applied in industry for electricity generation, hydrogen production, steam raising and liquid fuels production. Furthermore, it can utilize {{one or more}} feedstocks such as coal, biomass, municipal waste and petroleum coke. This versatility, {{in addition to being}} adaptable to various emissions control technologies (including carbon capture) renders it an attractive option for years to come. One of the most common gasifier types is the entrained-flow slagging gasifier. The behaviour of inorganic fuel components in these gasifiers is still ill-understood even though it can be the determining factor in their design and operation. A literature review of inorganic matter transformation sub-models for entrained-flow slagging gasifiers is provided. Slag viscosity was identified as a critical property in the sub-models. Slag viscosity models are only applicable to a limited range of slag compositions and conditions, and their performance is not easily assessed. An artificial neural network model was developed to predict slag viscosity over a broad range of temperatures and slag compositions. Furthermore, a toolbox was developed to assist slag viscosity model users in the selection of the best model for given slag compositions and conditions, and to help users determine how well the best model will perform. The slag viscosities of coal, petroleum coke and coal/petroleum coke blends were measured in the temperature range of 1175 - 1650 ºC. Interaction of vanadium-rich slags with various materials was investigated. The results from the first two parts of a three-part research program which involves fuel characterization, testing in a 1 MWth gasifier, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling for entrained-flow slagging gasification are presented. The end goal is to develop a CFD model which includes inorganic matter transformations. Fuel properties were determined with prioritization based on their application; screening of potential fuels, ensuring proper gasifier operation, gasifier design and/or CFD modeling. Using CanmetENERGY’s 1 MWth gasifier, five gasification tests were completed with the characterized coals.

40|$|Outokumpu Stainless Oy Tornio works {{produces}} {{in close}} future around 1. 7 million tonnes steel slabs annually. As {{all in the}} metallurgical processes the production of stainless steel is producing by-products as slags. The different kinds of processes produce about 300 000 tonnes slags annually, almost the whole amount {{of this has been}} deposited after the metal separation up to recent days. The project to utilize the steel slag started during 2001 with the aim {{to increase the amount of}} recycled by-products and to develop new slag-products. By-products are produced from the different process part as Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF 1, EAF 2), Argon Oxygen Decarburization converters (AOD 1, AOD 2), ladle stations and Chromium Converter (CRC). The chemical composition of slags from a process has a slight variation, but between the different processes the variations in analyses are greater. The chemical composition of the slags is dependent to the characters of the slag, as volume stability by basicity of the material. The aim of this work was to investigate the quality control of chromium containing steel slags during cooling into solid phase. The product should be an aggregate with sufficient hardness and low leaching behaviors. The investigation started when the slag was poured into a <b>slag</b> <b>pot</b> at melting shop, any addition of stabilizers or other chemical components has not been done. The aim was to investigate the dependence of different cooling methods to spinel forming. The physical properties of the product of the tests were tested by Nordic ball mill test (prEN 1097 - 9). The chemical analyses were: total analyses (XRF), and leaching test (Shaking test prEN 12457 - 3). A powder X-ray diffraction meter analyses (XRD) was used to estimate the mineralogy of the samples. The solid aggregate samples were studied with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Simulations with respective chemical analysis of the slags were done by the data program FactSage. The slags, included in this work, were mainly EAF 2 and CRC slags because of less variation in chemical analysis of these slags. These slags contain chromium, a minor part of chromium is not bound in spinels, which is a reason for leaching. During the first tests, which were carried out by water-cooling, no significant decreasing of leaching of chromium was observed. When pouring out the slag as a thin bed the leaching of chromium was lower compared to the massive bed of the same slag part. Lower leaching of chromium from the massive material from the thin bed can be caused by the smaller active surface of material. Reference test with semi-quenched slag were made and they showed low leaching values compared with the slags from normally pouring practices. Semi-quenched slag is porous and cannot be analyzed in SEM and was hence milled as powder and analyzed in XRD. The mineralogy of semi-quenched slag is varying in some degree from the mineralogy of normally poured slag. The semi-quenched slag, pumice, is partly amorphous which can be the reason for lower leaching values of chromium. Granulation tests have been made earlier with all of the three types of slag, but all of these showed higher leaching values than those of pumice. During granulation material may come in contact with air and become oxidized and chromium oxides leach more than other compounds of chromium. The lowest leaching values of slag can be attained by semi-quenching of material but the product is not an aggregate and cannot be used in all of the civil engineering applications. Aggregates can be produced by cooling on the slabs, but the slag bed should be maximum 10 cm thick, so that the gases can flow out before solidification of material. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|Soils on the Eastern Highveld acidify {{naturally}} due to {{the high}} rainfall {{and the use of}} certain nitrogen fertilizers. Liming materials are used to ameliorate soil acidity. A large fraction of this liming material used is Basic oxygen furnace slag (BOF slag), a secondary by-product from the Iron and Steel industry, commercially known as Aglime. These slag contain various concentration of heavy metals, like vanadium. No vanadium guidelines exist in South Africa. This study was done to determine the V threshold values where maize experienced reduced growth and to determine the V loading rate through slag application. A pot trial was used to determine the concentrations where vanadium reduces plant growth, and to establish toxicity levels in maize. The pot trail was used to establish V threshold values with various indicators, like total V concentration in the soil, total V concentration in the plant, Bray 1 extractable V and ammonium acetate extractable V, where maize experienced reduced growth. The threshold value where maize showed reduced growth in sandstone derived soils was at a total V concentration in the soil of 73. 3 mg kg- 1. The Bray 1 extractable V at this threshold was 23. 5 mg kg- 1 and there was no V in the above ground plant material in the maize. The ammonium acetate extractability at this level was 1. 68 mg kg- 1. V toxicity occurred at a total V concentration of 150 mg kg- 1, with Bray 1 extractable V at 77. 6 mg kg- 1 and total V in the maize plant 14. 8 mg kg- 1 For the dolerite derived soil the threshold value was determined to be 235 mg kg- 1 for the total V concentration in the soil. The Total V concentration in the plant was 0. 5 mg kg- 1 and the Bray 1 extractable V was 30. 3 mg kg- 1. The ammonium acetate extractable V was 1. 69 mg kg- 1. A pot trail and field evaluation site was used to determine the V loading through slag application. Three slag where used containing different V concentrations, slag A containing the highest V (918 mg kg- 1) and B (153 mg kg- 1) and C (88. 6 mg kg- 1) had a lower V concentrations. Theoretical V loading values was determined for three different slags containing different V concentrations and by using the threshold V concentration generated in chapter 3, the period to reach the critical V threshold value for liming with slag A was determined. If all factors (V concentration and incorporation depth), were to be kept constant, it will take an estimated 186 years of liming with slag A for the sandstone derived soil to reach the threshold value of 100 mg kg- 1 where V negatively affect the growth of maize plants. This period was calculated to be 472 years for the dolerite derived soil, {{due to the}} higher Fe content and finer textured soil, which increase the V sorption capacity of the soil. The safe period for the slag B and C in respect with V is much longer than slag A, but other heavy metal concentrations must be kept in mind for they too can accumulate in the soil and can influence the growth of maize negatively if certain threshold values are reached. The V concentration of all the parameters generated in the V toxicity pot trail was far below the threshold values of the <b>slag</b> <b>pot</b> trail and field evaluation site. This indicated that the slag use with high V concentration on the short term (10 years) is unlikely to negatively influence crop production.
