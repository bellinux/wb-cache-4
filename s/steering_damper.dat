5|$|One {{study has}} shown {{theoretically}} that, while a bike leaned in a turn, road undulations can excite the weave mode {{at high speed}} or the wobble mode at low speed if either of their frequencies match the vehicle speed and other parameters. Excitation of the wobble mode can be mitigated by an effective <b>steering</b> <b>damper</b> and excitation of the weave mode is worse for light riders than for heavy riders.|$|E
5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a <b>steering</b> <b>damper</b> to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E
25|$|Prior to launch, various {{observers}} {{said the}} Ninja H2-H2R {{could be expected}} to have electronic rider aids including anti-lock braking system (ABS), traction control (KTRC), engine braking control (KEBC), Kawasaki quick shifter (KQS), electronic <b>steering</b> <b>damper</b> (ESD), and launch control (KLCM) which are now confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Steering may be {{supplied}} by a rider or, under certain circumstances, by the bike itself. This self-stability {{is generated by}} a combination of several effects that depend on the geometry, mass distribution, and forward speed of the bike. Tires, suspension, <b>steering</b> <b>damping,</b> and frame flex can also influence it, especially in motorcycles.|$|R
5000|$|In rigid mounted rigs, leaning the {{motorcycle}} by clamping it rigidly {{a few degrees}} opposite the sidecar is used {{along with a few}} degrees of [...] "toe-in" [...] of the sidecar wheel toward the centerline of the vehicle to provide a balance resulting in comfortable, straight line travel. Most sidecars are also fitted with <b>steering</b> <b>damping</b> devices of either friction or hydraulic type to lessen the effects of sudden inputs, as encountered on rough roads, upon the vehicle's handling.|$|R
50|$|A bike remains upright {{when it is}} steered so {{that the}} ground {{reaction}} forces exactly balance all the other internal and external forces it experiences, such as gravitational if leaning, inertial or centrifugal if in a turn, gyroscopic if being steered, and aerodynamic if in a crosswind.Steering may be supplied by a rider or, under certain circumstances, by the bike itself.

25|$|The {{radio was}} built and {{operated}} in the British other ranks' compound. The {{maker of the}} radio was Warrant Officer Leonard A. T. Beckett, an experienced radio engineer, who was assisted in its construction, operation, and concealment by {{a core group of}} three other soldiers. Before Beckett could begin on the radio he first had to make some of the tools needed, such as a lathe and a soldering iron. In addition to the genuine radio parts provided by the Chinese family and a few parts brought along with the men from Tanjung Priok, the radio was constructed from items as diverse as a deaf aid, the <b>steering</b> <b>damper</b> of a Norton motorcycle, a bakelite shaving soap container, an army mess tin, the backing of an old map case, pieces of glass, wire, mica and barbed wire, and parts stolen from Japanese-owned motor cars and motorcycles. The receiver was completed within four weeks of starting.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic <b>steering</b> <b>damper</b> (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{changes were}} a <b>steering</b> <b>damper</b> with a {{reservoir}} and dual cooling fans with a larger, curved radiator.

40|$|Abstract. Accurate full vehicle {{handling}} prediction {{can be used}} to evaluate the vehicle dynamic performance. This paper presents the prediction and correlation of full {{vehicle handling}} with ADAMS/Car. After building the initial model, major flexible component, <b>steering</b> friction and <b>damping</b> was introduced to optimize the model that makes the model much more accurate. The model will be used to run four major vehicle handling events; the predicted results are compared with measured data. The correlation includes time history of steering wheel angle, steering torque, lateral acceleration, side slip angle, roll, yaw etc. It also includes the derivates such as understeer gradients, steering gradients, side slip gradients, roll gradients etc. It is shown that good correlations are obtained in handling...|$|R
40|$|Due to many special {{characteristics}} of the motion of a yacht in response to wind, sea and other conditions, the issues associated with designing an automatic controller for a yacht steering and rolling stabilisation are quite different from those for engine-powered vessels. This paper presents some simulation results of the behaviour of a 12 -m America's Cup yacht, indicating the non-linear character of yacht motion. With a view to developing an adaptive <b>steering</b> and roll <b>damping</b> controller for yachts, the behaviour of linear yacht models is examined and a case presented for online recursive modelling.

40|$|Steering wheel {{vibration}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} factor in determining the operator’s comfort in an agricultural tractor. Over the past 20 years automobile quality and consumer perceptions and demands have been an increasing part of the vehicle engineering process. This project deals with study of vibration related issues in steering wheel of tractor. The design and analysis of steering system plays a major role for determining the root cause for the problem. Main sources of steering wheel vibration are found to be engine imbalance, resonance of <b>steering</b> system, lesser <b>damping,</b> road / field induced vibration. Steering vibration study was conducted on various tractor models and one tractor was identified for improvement. Upon detailed analysis on that particular tractor, it was found that the resonance of steering system with engine excitation is the root cause for excessive vibration. Various methods such as shifting the natural frequency away from the second order engine frequency and increasing damping coefficient to reduce the vibration amplitude at resonance are considered to reduce vibrations due to resonance. Axial damper concept is used for vibration reduction. Analysis is done in Matlab Simulink with two degree of freedom model with base excitation...|$|R

5000|$|The Cefiro was {{introduced}} {{as a result}} of cross-town rival Toyota expanding its Mark II platform with the Toyota Cresta and Toyota Chaser triplets, with Nissan offering the Cefiro as a comparable fourth alternative to the Skyline and Laurel models, selling each vehicle at a separate Nissan dealership (Nissan Prince for the Skyline, Nissan Motor for the Laurel, Nissan Bluebird for the Leopard, and Nissan Satio for the Cefiro). The model code [...] "A31" [...] was chosen as the number combination [...] "A30" [...] was previously used by the 1967-1971 Nissan Gloria soon after Nissan had merged with the Prince Motor Company. The Cefiro took the top-level position at Nissan Satio as its exterior dimensions were exactly the same as the luxury sedans Nissan Cedric (exclusive to Nissan Bluebird) and the Nissan Gloria (exclusive to Nissan Prince) locations.Brand new, the Cefiro was slightly more expensive than the equivalent Nissan Skyline and had many modern features available for the first time. They included projector beam headlights, automatic tinting rear vision cabin mirror, electrically adjustable seats, automatic headlights, steering wheel mounted radio controls, HICAS four-wheel <b>steering,</b> electronically adjustable (<b>damper)</b> suspension and Nissans proprietary 4WD system, ATTESA E-TS. Due to its luxurious content of equipment and features installed, it helped to justify the moderately high annual road tax bill to Japanese buyers.|$|R
50|$|The two bikes use {{the same}} bodywork, {{including}} the fuel tank. With {{the exception of the}} <b>steering</b> <b>damper</b> mount, the frame between the bikes is the same, which results in identical wheelbase and rake and trail numbers. The second generation 848 Evo features the same monoblock brakes and the same frame with the <b>steering</b> <b>damper</b> mount as the 1098/1198. The rear suspension, including the suspension linkage is the same, using identical Showa shocks. Many components of the exhaust system are shared, including the exhaust canisters that house the muffler and catalytic converter.|$|E
50|$|To help {{address the}} speed wobble issue, the H2 {{came with a}} {{friction-type}} <b>steering</b> <b>damper,</b> {{as well as a}} built-in frame lug to attach a hydraulic <b>steering</b> <b>damper.</b> The H2 had a front disc brake, an all-new capacitor discharge ignition system which performed better than cap and rotor type, was virtually maintenance free, and was unique to the H2. The H2 also had a chain oiler, and a steering friction damper. The front disc brake performed adequately, though some riders added a second front disc for more braking performance.|$|E

50|$|For {{motorcycles}} with sidecars, {{especially for}} motorcycles {{which have been}} retrofitted with a sidecar and where the front wheel geometry, or trail, has not been adjusted for use with a sidecar, a <b>steering</b> <b>damper</b> is beneficial. This prevents low speed wobble which may occur in the lower speed range of about 13 to 20 mph. In older motorcycles adjustable friction dampers had been routinely installed. Hydraulically operated steering dampers may be retrofitted. In some jurisdictions, the installation and operation of a <b>steering</b> <b>damper</b> must be inspected by an expert or examiner and must be entered in the vehicle papers.|$|E
