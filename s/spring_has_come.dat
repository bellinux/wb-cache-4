6000|$|... "See {{the little}} birds, pappa John. They's 'bout {{a million of}} 'um, ain't they? They're glad <b>spring</b> <b>has</b> <b>come,</b> ain't they, pappa? They can {{understand}} each other {{just the same as}} we can, can't they, pappa John?" ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>spring</b> <b>has</b> <b>come.</b> The {{air of the}} April {{night just}} lifts {{the leaves of the}} {{sleeping}} flowers. The moon is queen in the cloudless and starless sky. The stillness of the midnight hour is abroad, over land and over sea.|$|E
60|$|The long hard winter <b>had</b> passed, and <b>Spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come.</b> Prickly Porky the Porcupine {{came down}} from a tall poplar-tree and slowly {{stretched}} himself. He was tired of eating. He was tired of swinging in the tree-top.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a {{nuisance}} {{it is to}} be a slave to the pen," [...] I answered, for the <b>spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to the land. I <b>had</b> hated the <b>spring</b> for seven years because to me it meant discomfort.|$|R
6000|$|On Easter Sunday {{the girls}} {{came out in}} their delicious dresses, looking dainty and sweet as the lilies each church displayed. New hats, new grasses and {{springing}} plants announced that <b>spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come.</b> The [...] "leaves of absence" [...] indicated spring in the House.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well, really,' cried Hans, 'it is {{very good}} of you to ask, very good indeed. I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the <b>spring</b> <b>has</b> <b>come,</b> and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.' ...|$|E
6000|$|One {{morning the}} Giant was lying awake in bed {{when he heard}} some lovely music. It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought {{it must be the}} King's musicians passing by. It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most {{beautiful}} music in the world. Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement. [...] "I believe the <b>Spring</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> at last," [...] said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.|$|E
60|$|On {{other days}} we would {{pay visits to}} the country seats {{at some of the}} great lords' {{beautiful}} fortified places, and the villages clustering beneath their walls. Here we saw vineyards and corn-fields and well-kept park-like grounds, with such timber in them as filled me with delight, for I do love a good tree. There it stands so strong and sturdy, and yet so beautiful, a very type of the best sort of man. How proudly it lifts its bare head to the winter storms, and with what a full heart it rejoices when the <b>spring</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> again! How grand its voice is, too, when it talks with the wind: a thousand aeolian harps cannot equal the beauty of the sighing of a great tree in leaf. All day it points to the sunshine and all night to the stars, and thus passionless, and yet full of life, it endures through the centuries, come storm, come shine, drawing its sustenance from the cool bosom of its mother earth, and as the slow years roll by, learning the great mysteries of growth and of decay. And so on and on through generations, outliving individuals, customs, dynasties -- all save the landscape it adorns and human nature -- till the appointed day when the wind wins the long battle and rejoices over a reclaimed space, or decay puts the last stroke to his fungus-fingered work.|$|E
6000|$|Five--ay, three minutes--did the {{business}} {{at the back of}} that row of bees. Though <b>spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come,</b> and heavenly blue consecrated the scene, Darton succeeded not. 'No,' said Sally firmly. 'I will never, never marry you, Mr. Darton. I would have done it once; but now I never can.' ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come,</b> {{clothing}} {{the weird}} {{branches of the}} elms with a tender garb of green, the anemones in the woods yielded to the bluebells and these to carpets of primroses and violets. The forests of Thanet echoed with songs of linnets and white-throats. She was happy {{and she was in}} love.|$|R
50|$|The Great {{porcupine}} Fire of 1911 {{was one of}} {{the most}} devastating forest fires ever to strike the Ontario northland. <b>Spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> early that year, followed by an abnormally hot dry spell that lasted into the summer. This created ideal conditions for the ensuing disaster, in which a number of smaller fires converged.|$|R
60|$|We {{have heard}} of a Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. It is said that {{knowledge}} is power, and the like. Methinks there is equal need of a Society for the Diffusion of Useful Ignorance, what we will call Beautiful Knowledge, a knowledge useful in a higher sense: for what is most of our boasted so-called knowledge but a conceit that we know something, which robs us of the advantage of our actual ignorance? What we call knowledge is often our positive ignorance; ignorance our negative knowledge. By long years of patient industry and reading of the newspapers--for what are the libraries of science but files of newspapers--a man accumulates a myriad facts, lays them up in his memory, and then when in some spring {{of his life he}} saunters abroad into the Great Fields of thought, he, as it were, goes to grass like a horse and leaves all his harness behind in the stable. I would say to the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, sometimes,--Go to grass. You have eaten hay long enough. The <b>spring</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> with its green crop. The very cows are driven to their country pastures before the end of May; though I {{have heard of}} one unnatural farmer who kept his cow in the barn and fed her on hay all the year round. So, frequently, the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge treats its cattle.|$|E

60|$|I am glad {{we did not}} mar the sunshine. It did {{not last}} long. She came home {{thoroughly}} unwell from their journey to Switzerland, and never got better. By the time the <b>spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> round again, she was lying in the vault at Trevorsham, and {{we were trying to}} keep poor little Alured alive and help my poor father to bear it.|$|R
6000|$|On this {{occasion}} time did not envy them. The long afternoons of <b>spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come,</b> and as Tregear {{had reached the}} house between four and five {{they were able to}} go out together before the sun set. [...] "No," [...] she said when he came to inquire as to her life during the last twelve months; [...] "you had not much to be afraid of as to my forgetting." ...|$|R
60|$|Darkly {{the shadow}} lay upon the Valley of Fear. The <b>spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> with running brooks and blossoming trees. There was hope for all Nature bound {{so long in}} an iron grip; but nowhere was there any hope {{for the men and}} women who lived under the yoke of the terror. Never had the cloud above them been so dark and hopeless as in the early summer of the year 1875.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>Has</b> <b>Come</b> (Japanese: 春が来た; Romanization: Harugakita) is an {{upcoming}} Japanese television series starring Kai. The series {{is based on}} a novel with the same name and is written by Kuniko Mukōda. The date release is yet to be confirmed.|$|E
50|$|In January 2017, Kai was {{announced}} to be starring as the male {{lead in the}} upcoming KBS drama Andante, playing a high school student. In February 2017, he was cast in the upcoming Japanese drama <b>Spring</b> <b>Has</b> <b>Come</b> based on the Japanese novel of the same name. The drama {{marks the first time}} a non-Japanese actor taking a lead role on a drama produced by the broadcasting station WOWOW.|$|E
50|$|The fable {{is about}} {{a young man who}} spends all his money on {{gambling}} and luxurious living until he has only a cloak to keep off the weather. Seeing an unusually early swallow fly by, the man concludes that <b>spring</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> and sells his cloak so as to use the proceeds to mend his fortune with a last bet. Not only does he lose his money but cold weather closes in again. Finding the swallow frozen to death, the young man blames it for deceiving him. In later versions this takes place on the bank of a frozen brook and the young man also dies of cold.|$|E
6000|$|And {{then the}} almanac lied, {{and said that}} <b>spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come.</b> <b>Spring</b> comes when it comes. The frozen snows of January still lay like adamant in the crosstown streets. The hand-organs still played [...] "In the Good Old Summertime," [...] with their December vivacity and expression. Men began to make thirty-day notes to buy Easter dresses. Janitors shut off steam. And when these things happen one may know {{that the city is}} still in the {{clutches}} of winter.|$|R
60|$|Johnny Chuck couldn't {{keep away}} from the Smiling Pool. No, Sir, Johnny Chuck couldn't {{keep away from}} the Smiling Pool. Ever since he and Peter Rabbit had gone over there looking for the sweet singers, who every night {{and part of the}} day told all who would listen how glad they were that Mistress <b>Spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to the Green Meadows and the Green Forest, Johnny Chuck had had {{something}} on his mind. And this is why he couldn't keep away from the Smiling Pool.|$|R
60|$|Otherwise {{the winter}} {{passed away in}} a round of {{pleasant}} duties and studies. For Anne the days slipped by like golden beads on the necklace of the year. She was happy, eager, interested; there were {{lessons to be learned}} and honor to be won; delightful books to read; new pieces to be practiced for the Sunday-school choir; pleasant Saturday afternoons at the manse with Mrs. Allan; and then, almost before Anne realized it, <b>spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> again to Green Gables and all the world was abloom once more.|$|R
5000|$|... "On the European shore, <b>spring</b> <b>has</b> <b>come.</b> ...The asphodel {{and many}} other species {{including}} the wild gladiolus, scarlet crowfoot and 50-odd species of orchid have kept the surplus food they made last year stored underground in bulbs and swollen roots. At {{the first hint of}} spring they use those savings to produce flowers, in some cases, even before they've sprouted leaves. At the same time, neatly synchronised by the warming weather, insects are hatching. Now they are busy collecting the bribes of nectar, advertised by the flowers, as inducements to transport pollen. This is the banquet that the birds have come to feed on." [...] Extract from David Attenborough's narration ...|$|E
50|$|Baba Dochia has a son, called Dragomir, who is married. Dochia ill-treats her daughter-in-law {{by sending}} her {{to pick up}} berries in the forest {{at the end of}} February. God appears to the girl as an old man and helps her in her task. When Dochia sees the berries, she thinks that <b>spring</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> back and leaves for the {{mountains}} with her son and her goats. She is dressed with twelve lambskins, but it rains on the mountain and the skins get soaked and heavy. Dochia has {{to get rid of the}} skins and when frost comes she perishes from the cold with her goats. Her son freezes to death with a piece of ice in his mouth as he was playing the flute.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>has</b> <b>come.</b> The story {{transitions}} {{back to the}} noblewoman, {{laying in}} her bedroom. Her condition has worsened. A priest waits on a divan outside, while the husband talks with his wife's sister. Afterwards, the sister attempts to comfort the noblewoman, who begins claiming that {{she has come to}} terms with death. This mature and faithful attitude leads the sister to say that Lady Shirkinskaya [...] "is an angel" [...] as she leaves the room. Proclaiming God's mercifulness, the noblewoman beckons her husband closer and commands him to send for the medicine the priest mentioned earlier. For a woman that has accepted her death, Lady Shirkinskaya continues to cling on to any hope of living. That evening, she died in her large apartment with closed doors.|$|E
60|$|COLD WINTER <b>had</b> {{passed and}} <b>spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come.</b> No leafy {{thickness}} had yet clad the woodlands, but the budding leaves hung like a tender mist about the trees. In the open country the meadow lands lay a sheeny green, the cornfields a dark velvety color, {{for they were}} thick and soft with the growing blades. The plowboy shouted in the sun, and in the purple new-turned furrows flocks of birds hunted for fat worms. All the broad moist earth smiled in the warm light, and each little green hill clapped its hand for joy.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> {{again when}} he rode into the Panhandle, and {{as luck would have}} it he fell in with an outfit who were driving cattle to Montana, a job that would take until late fall. To his chagrin stories of his wildness had preceded him. Ill rumor travels swiftly. Pan was the more liked and {{respected}} by these riders. But he feared that gossip of the southern ranges would reach his mother. He would go home that fall to reassure her of his well-being, and that he was not one of those [...] "bad, gun-throwing cowboys." ...|$|R
60|$|A soft wind {{swept the}} prairie, {{which was now}} bare of snow. Larry rode down the trail that led through the Cedar Bluff. He was freely {{sprinkled}} with mire, for <b>spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> suddenly, and the frost-bleached sod was soft with the thaw; and when he pulled up on the wooden bridge to wait until Breckenridge, who appeared among the trees, should join him, the river swirled and frothed beneath. It had lately burst its icy chains, and came roaring down, seamed by lines of foam and strewn with great fragments of half-melted snow-cake that burst against the quivering piles.|$|R
5000|$|The 12th Touhou game. It was {{announced}} on February 26, 2009. A demo was released at the Reitaisai 6 convention on March 8, 2009, {{and the full}} version was released on August 15, 2009 at Comiket 76. <b>Spring</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> to Gensokyo and a magical flying ship that is said to bring good omen {{has appeared in the}} sky. The player assumes the role of either Reimu, Marisa, or Sanae Kotiya, who returns from Mountain of Faith, as the three girls race to board the vessel. While the separate bomb counter is back, the scoring system gets complemented by the [...] "Undefined Fantastic Objects", or UFOs, that appear as traditional unidentified flying objects in three colors (green, red and blue) and must be collected in groups of three in order to get different bonuses.|$|E
5000|$|The {{group has}} {{its origins in}} the {{ensemble}} brought together for the musical play Veronika, der Lenz ist da - Die Comedian Harmonists (Veronica, <b>Spring</b> <b>Has</b> <b>Come</b> - The Comedian Harmonists), which had its premiere on 19 December 1997 at the Komödie am Kurfürstendamm on the Kurfürstendamm in Berlin. This followed the screening of a film, Comedian Harmonists (1997), which like the musical was about a Berlin group, the [...] "Comedian Harmonists", which flourished between 1927 and 1934, {{when it came to}} an end due to the rise of the National Socialists to power and their anti-Jewish measures. Most of the group's songs had been written by Jewish composers, and the group also had Jewish members who were prevented from performing. Following the success of the play which brought them together, the singers were several times asked to give gala performances and concerts outside the context of the original production, and a new musical group thus came into being.|$|E
50|$|Another {{version of}} this story is that Dragobete marries a girl against Baba Dochia's will. Angry with her son's decision, she sends her {{daughter}} in law to wash some black wool in the river and tells her not to come back until the wool has turned white. The girl tries to wash it, but the wool would not change color. In despair and with her hands frozen from the cold water of the river, the girl starts crying, thinking {{that she would never}} be able to see her loved husband again. Then Jesus sees her from the sky and feels sorry for her, so he gives her a red flower telling her to wash the wool with that. As soon as she washes the wool as told by Jesus, it turns white so the girl happily returns home. When Baba Dochia hears about her story, she gets angry and thinks <b>spring</b> <b>has</b> <b>come,</b> since the man (who the girls had not recognized as being Jesus) was able to offer her a flower. She leaves for the mountains dressed in nine coats. As the weather changes fast on the mountain, she starts throwing away her coats, one by one, until she is left with no coats. But as soon as she drops her last coat, the weather changes again and Baba Dochia is frozen on the mountain.|$|E
60|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> {{once more}} to Green Gables--the {{beautiful}} capricious, reluctant Canadian spring, lingering along through April and May in a succession of sweet, fresh, chilly days, with pink sunsets and miracles of resurrection and growth. The maples in Lover's Lane were red budded and little curly ferns pushed up around the Dryad's Bubble. Away up in the barrens, behind Mr. Silas Sloane's place, the Mayflowers blossomed out, pink and white stars of sweetness under their brown leaves. All the school girls and boys had one golden afternoon gathering them, coming home in the clear, echoing twilight with arms and baskets full of flowery spoil.|$|R
60|$|It must be {{recorded}} that henceforward Sally {{was a model}} of virtue, {{so much so that}} I marveled, while at times her brother appeared to find it hard to conceal his astonishment. She was more subdued in manner and gentle in speech, while I could now understand the soft light which filled her eyes when they rested upon my foreman. The former spirit, however, still lurked within her, for returning to the house one evening when <b>spring</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> around again, I saw Cotton, who had once been a favorite of hers, leap out of the door with a brush whirling through the air close behind him.|$|R
50|$|Some {{more recent}} {{assessments}} of Al Jazeera have criticized {{it for a}} lack of credibility {{in the wake of the}} Arab <b>Spring.</b> Criticism <b>has</b> <b>come</b> from within the Arab Middle East, including from state governments. Independent commentators have criticized its neutrality vis-a-vis the Syrian Civil War.|$|R
