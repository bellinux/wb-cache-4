5|$|The {{first case}} against Acton, before Mr. Baron Carter, {{was for the}} murder in 1726 of Thomas Bliss, a {{carpenter}} and debtor. Unable to pay the prison fees, Bliss had been left with so little to eat that {{he had tried to}} escape by throwing a rope over the wall, but his pursuers severed it and he fell 20feet into the prison yard. Wanting to know who had supplied the rope, Acton beat him with a bull's pizzle, <b>stamped</b> <b>on</b> his stomach, placed him in the hole (a damp space under the stairs), then in the strong room.|$|E

5|$|The {{internal}} {{volume is}} commonly quoted {{in most countries}} using the metric system. This information is required by ISO13769 to be <b>stamped</b> <b>on</b> the cylinder shoulder. It can be measured easily by filling the cylinder with fresh water. This {{has resulted in the}} term 'water capacity', abbreviated as WC which is often stamp marked on the cylinder shoulder. It's almost always expressed as a volume in litres, but sometimes as mass of the water in kg. Fresh water has a density close to one kilogram per litre so the numerical values are effectively identical at one decimal place accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Cylinder working {{pressure}} is specified at a reference temperature, usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} specified maximum safe working temperature, often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does not exceed the specified {{working pressure}} <b>stamped</b> <b>on</b> the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified working pressure when the filling temperature is greater than the reference temperature, but not more than 65°C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct working pressure when cooled to the reference temperature.|$|E

5|$|Live'r Than You'll Ever Be is a bootleg {{recording}} of the Rolling Stones' concert in Oakland, California, from 9 November 1969. It {{was one of the}} first live rock music bootlegs and was made notorious as a document of their 1969 tour of the United States. The popularity of the bootleg forced the Stones' label Decca Records to release the live album Get Yer Ya-Yas Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert in 1970. Live'r is also one of the earliest commercial bootleg recordings in rock history, released in December 1969, just two months after the Beatles' Kum Back and five months after Bob Dylan's Great White Wonder. Like the two earlier records, Live'rs outer sleeve is plain white, with its name <b>stamped</b> <b>on</b> in ink.|$|E
5|$|Phan Quang Đán {{joined the}} {{rebellion}} and acted as the rebels' spokesman. The most prominent political critic of Diệm, Đán had been disqualified from the 1959 legislative election after winning his seat by {{a ratio of}} 6:1 despite Diệm having organised votestacking against him. He cited political mismanagement of {{the war against the}} Viet Cong and the government's refusal to broaden its political base as the reason for the revolt. Đán spoke on Radio Vietnam and staged a media conference during which a rebel paratrooper pulled a portrait of the president from the wall, ripped it and <b>stamped</b> <b>on</b> it. In the meantime, Thuy went about organising a coalition of political parties to take over post-Diệm. He had already lined up the VNQDĐ, Đại Việt, and the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài religious movements, and was seeking more collaborators.|$|E
5|$|The first popular {{rock music}} bootleg {{resulted}} from Bob Dylan's activities between largely disappearing {{from the public}} eye after his motorcycle accident in 1966, {{and the release of}} John Wesley Harding at the end of 1967. After a number of artists had hits with Dylan songs that he had not officially recorded and released himself, demand increased for these recordings, particularly when they started airing on local radio in Los Angeles. Through various contacts in the radio industry, a number of pioneering bootleggers managed to buy a reel to reel tape containing a selection of unreleased Dylan songs intended for distribution for music publishers and wondered if {{it would be possible to}} manufacture them on an LP. They managed to convince a local pressing plant to press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies discreetly, paying in cash and avoiding using real names or addresses. Since the bootleggers could not commercially print a sleeve, due to it attracting too much attention from recording companies, the LP was issued in a plain white cover with Great White Wonder rubber <b>stamped</b> <b>on</b> it. Subsequently, Dylan became one of the most popular artists to be bootlegged with numerous releases.|$|E
