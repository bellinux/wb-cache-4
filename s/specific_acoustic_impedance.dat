40|$|This paper {{studies the}} diffuse field sound {{absorption}} coefficient of a system consisting of a rigid perforated panel with a thin porous woven/matted material glued to its back, which is {{placed in front of}} an air cavity with a rigid backing. To cut the cost of trial and error diffuse field {{sound absorption coefficient}} measurements, a prediction method was developed. Measurements were made in a two-microphone impedance tube of the complex <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedances</b> of the unperforated rigid panel materials and of the thin porous materials in front of a rigidly terminated air cavity. These values were used in the transfer matrix method to predict the complex <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedances</b> of the perforated panels systems {{as a function of the}} angle of incidence of the sound. These calculations assumed the systems to have infinite or finite lateral extent. The measured diffuse field sound absorption coefficient values usually lay between the infinite and finite predictions. The most important variables are the perforation factor of the panel, the acoustic resistance of the thin porous material and the cavity depth...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to impedance matching for ultrasonic transducers. A single matching layer with high <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance</b> of 16 MRayls is demonstrated to show a bandwidth of around 70 %, compared with conventional single matching layer designs of around 50 %. Although as a consequence of this improvement in bandwidth, there is a loss in sensitivity, this is found to be similar to an equivalent double matching layer design. Designs are calculated by using the KLM model and are then verified by FEA simulation, with very good agreement Considering the fabrication difficulties encountered in creating a high-frequency double matched design due to the requirement for materials with <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedances,</b> the need to accurately control the thickness of layers, and the relatively narrow bandwidths available for conventional single matched designs, the new approach shows advantages in that alternative (and perhaps more practical) materials become available, and offers a bandwidth close to that of a double layer design with the simplicity of a single layer design. The disadvantage is a trade-off in sensitivity. A typical example of a piezoceramic transducer matched to water can give a 70 % fractional bandwidth (comparable to an ideal double matched design of 72 %) with a 3 dB penalty in insertion loss. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{data were}} taken to {{determine}} the acoustic absorbing properties of uniform low density and layered variable density samples using a bulk absober with a perforated plate facing to hold the material in place. In the layered variable density case, the bulk absorber was packed such that the lowest density layer began at {{the surface of the}} sample and progressed to higher density layers deeper inside. The samples were placed in a rectangular duct and measurements were taken using the two microphone method. The data were used to calculate <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedances</b> and normal incidence absorption coefficients. Results showed that for uniform density samples the absorption coefficient at low frequencies decreased with increasing density and resonances occurred in the absorption coefficient curve at lower densities. These results were confirmed by a model for uniform density bulk absorbers. Results from layered variable density samples showed that low frequency absorption was the highest when the lowest density possible was packed in the first layer near the exposed surface. The layers of increasing density within the sample had the effect of damping the resonances...|$|R

40|$|The {{refraction}} convolution section (RCS) is {{a simple}} and efficient method for full trace processing of shallow seismic refraction data. It facilitates improved interpretation of shallow seismic refraction data through the convenient use of amplitudes as well as traveltimes. The RCS is generated by the convolution of forward and reverse shot records. The convolution operation effectively adds the first arrival traveltimes of each pair of forward and reverse traces and produces {{a measure of the}} depth to the refracting interface in units of time which is equivalent to the time-depth function of the generalized reciprocal method (GRM). The convolution operation also multiplies the amplitudes of first arrival signals. This operation compensates for the large effects of geometric spreading to a very good first approximation, with the result that the convolved amplitude is essentially proportional to the square of the head coefficient. The head coefficient is approximately proportional to the ratio of the <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedances</b> in the upper layer and in the refractor, where there is a reasonable contrast between the <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedances</b> in the layers. The RCS can also include a separation between each pair of forward and reverse traces in order to accommodate the offset distance {{in a manner similar to}} the XY spacing of the GRM. Lateral variations in the near-surface soil layers can effect amplitudes thereby causing 'amplitude statics'. Increases in the thickness of the surface soil layer correlate with increases in refraction amplitudes. These increases are adequately described and corrected with the transmission coefficients of the Zoeppritz equations. The minimum amplitudes, rather than an average, should be used where it is not possible to map the near surface layers. The use of amplitudes with 3 D data effectively improves the spatial resolution by almost an order of magnitude. Amplitudes provide a measure of refractor wavespeeds at each detector, whereas the analysis of traveltimes provides a measure over several detectors, commonly a minimum of six. The ratio of amplitudes obtained with different shot azimuths provides a detailed qualitative measure of azimuthal anisotropy. Dip filtering of the RCS removes 'cross-convolution' artifacts and provides a convenient approach to the study of later events. The RCS facilitates the stacking of refraction data in a manner similar to the CMP methods of reflection seismology. It can improve signal-to-noise ratios...|$|R

5000|$|... z0 varies greatly among media, {{especially}} between gas and condensed phases. Water is 800 times denser than air and {{its speed}} of sound is 4.3 {{times as fast as}} that of air. So the <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance</b> of water is 3,500 times higher than that of air. This means that a sound in water with a given pressure amplitude is 3,500 times less intense than one in air with the same pressure. This is because the air, with its lower z0, moves with a much greater velocity and displacement amplitude than does water. Reciprocally, if a sound in water and another in air have the same intensity, then the pressure is much smaller in air. These variations lead to important differences between room acoustics or atmospheric acoustics on the one hand, and underwater acoustics on the other.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} {{of an active}} control force on a thin-walled acoustic boundary can modify the motional dynamics, and so influence the impedance presented to incident waves. This impedance determines transmission of acoustic energy, reflection of acoustic waves from the boundary and absorption of incident energy. This thesis studies control systems that generate control forces for the active control of surface acoustic impedance. The proposed systems rely on measurement of the acoustic pressure and surface velocity of the boundary. The systems can use adaptive digital signal processing, which offers significant advantages over non-adaptive techniques. The active control of the <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance</b> of a loudspeaker that terminates a waveguide for axially propagating plane waves provides a motivating problem. Theoretical analysis establishes the control of <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance</b> of a simple compliantly-suspended piston by a control force. Operational constraints of a physical piston define theoretical operating limits for controlled specific acoustic impedances. The control systems use either feedback or feed-forward techniques for which theoretical treatment reveals restrictions on the range of controlled <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance.</b> A novel result is that conventional implementations of the control systems can be unstable for certain desired impedances unless feedback cancellation is used. Digital feedback techniques are less effective for broader frequency bandwidth where feed-forward techniques may work. Theoretical analysis produces solutions that confirm the feasibility of these control techniques for the active control of <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance.</b> Potential errors {{in the implementation of}} the systems have predictable effects on the controlled <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance.</b> Experimental results support the theoretical work presented in this thesis, demonstrating active control of <b>specific</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>impedance</b> for normally incident acoustic plane waves.
