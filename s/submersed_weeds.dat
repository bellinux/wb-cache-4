40|$|Acrolein is a dual-purpose {{chemical}} {{effective against}} both <b>submersed</b> <b>weeds</b> and snails, {{and it may}} therefore be of significance in bilharziasis control. During trials in the Egypt- 49 -project area in 1962, it was effective in clearing heavy mats of the major submersed aquatic weed Potamogeton crispus from irrigation canals. The resurgence of snails to pretreatment levels was delayed by 8 - 12 months, and <b>submersed</b> <b>weeds</b> did not reappear until 8 months after treatment. In phytotoxicity tests on local crops, {{it was found that}} the concentration of acrolein required for destroying <b>submersed</b> <b>weeds</b> (20 - 25 ppm) had no adverse effect on the crops.

40|$|PURPOSE: During the {{registration}} process for evaluating aquatic herbicides, {{it is important}} to determine both the efficacy on target vegetation as well as the potential impacts on non-target vegetation. Herbicide applications for <b>submersed</b> <b>weeds</b> can negatively impact some non-target emergent species. Factors such as the plant species and growth stage, and the herbicide treatment rates and exposure time can often dictate the selective potential of an aquatic herbicide. There are currently several new herbicide modes of action being evaluated for the aquatic market, and determination of selectivity is important in determining potential use patterns. This study was conducted to determine the effect of submersed applications of bispyribac-sodium (2, 6 -bis(4, 6 -dimethoxypyrimidin- 2 -yloxy) benzoic acid) on arrowhead (Sagittaria latifolia Willd.), pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata L.), and duck potato (Sagittaria lancifolia L.). BACKGROUND: With the discovery of fluridone-resistant hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata (L. f.) Royle) in Florida (Arias et al. 2005; Michel et al. 2004), several acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors, including bispyribac-sodium, have been evaluated for hydrilla control. Bispyribac-sodium is currently being evaluated for aquatic use under an Experimental Use Permit (EUP) issued by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Similar to fluridone, the ALS inhibitors target a plant-specifi...|$|E
40|$|The {{molluscan}} {{hosts of}} Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma mansoni and Fasciola spp. {{have been found}} to flourish in association with certain submersed, floating and emergent weeds in the irrigation system of the Egypt 49 project area. The efficacy of acrolein in killing Potamogeton crispus, an important <b>submersed</b> <b>weed,</b> has been previously established. The present paper deals with field trials of different herbicides, alone or combined, against the other predominant types of floating and emergent weeds—Eichhornia crassipes, Panicum repens, Typha ungustata and Scirpus inclinatus. The trials showed that some of the herbicides are effective and have economic advantages over the manual removal of weeds, besides eliminating the health hazard involved in manual removal. Laboratory tests showed that the herbicides also have ovicidal properties. Aquatic-weed control by the use of appropriate herbicides as an adjunct to molluscicides is therefore advocated...|$|R
40|$|Although {{relatively}} few insects {{have been reported}} to feed on submersed aquatic plants, field surveys on Hydrilla verticillata (L. F.) Royle for biological control agents have demonstrated that insect herbivores should be expected when surveying submersed aquatic plants in the native ranges. Beetles, or Coleoptera, especially the weevils (Curculionidae), are important herbivores. Weevils attack submersed plant species both when water is present and when water is absent during dry periods which leave the plants exposed. Pupal success appears to be the major determinant of weevil life cycle strategies. Donaciine leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) attack the roots or crowns of submersed species, but their feeding and damage is difficult to determine. Leaf-mining Hydrellia flies (Diptera: Ephydridae) are diverse and common on submersed species. Other flies, the midges (Chironomidae), are also common on submersed species, but many utilize the plants only for shelter. However, midge larvae ate the apical meristems on the tips of hydrilla stems. Aquatic caterpillars (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) are the herbivores most eas-ily observed on submersed species because of their large size and conspicuous damage, but their host ranges might be too broad for use as biological control agents. More research is needed on the field biologies of aquatic insect herbivores. Field surveys should be conducted on <b>submersed</b> aquatic <b>weeds</b> {{even in the absence of}} literature reports of insect herbivores. Until a reasonable database of herbivores and their host plants is assem-bled, it is difficult to evaluate the suitability of biological control for a <b>submersed</b> aquat-ic <b>weed...</b>|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: It {{has been}} speculated that {{herbicide}} drift from treated sites can negatively impact desirable floating vegetation {{and there are many}} scenarios where targeted <b>submersed</b> <b>weeds</b> and non-target floating plants grow in close proximity. This study was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} submersed applications of 2, 4 -D ester and triclopyr amine, used to control Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.), on waterlily (Nymphaea odorata Ait.) and spatterdock (Nuphar lutea (L.) Sm.). BACKGROUND: Waterlily and spatterdock are two ecologically important shoreline plants in Midwestern lakes, providing valuable habitat for invertebrates, amphibians, fish, waterbirds, and aquatic mammals. The seeds are a food source for waterfowl and the rhizomes are eaten by muskrats, beaver, and porcupines (Borman et. al. 1997). Many Midwestern lakes, however, have been heavily infested with the non-native submersed plant Eurasian watermilfoil. Submersed applications of 2, 4 -D (ester and amine formulations) and triclopyr (amine formulation) are typically used to control Eurasian watermilfoil, and there is concern that off-site drift from these applications may cause un-intended damage to non-target, floating-leaved plant stands. Both 2, 4 -D and triclopyr are auxin-type herbicides effective on dicotyledons (dicots). An advantag...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This {{small-scale}} {{study examined}} three turbidity {{levels in the}} water column to investi-gate the efficacy of diquat (6, 7 -dihydrodipyrido[1, 2 -α: 2 ’, 1 ’-c]pyrazinediium ion) in combination with the dipotassium salt of endothall (7 -oxabicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptane- 2, 3 -dicarboxylic acid) to control hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata (L. f.) Royle). BACKGROUND: Diquat is an effective contact herbicide for controlling noxious aquatic weeds. For controlling <b>submersed</b> <b>weeds,</b> it is typically used in small treatment areas near boat docks, swimming beaches, and lake access points. Frequently, it is applied in areas where there is rapid water exchange as it quickly interrupts plant photosynthesis causing plant death in 4 to 7 days. Symptoms may be evident in as little as a few hours after treatment. Details of the diquat mode of action are reviewed by Hess (2000). Turbid water may interfere with the efficacy of diquat treatments (Bowmer 1982 a, 1982 b). Turbidity is caused by suspended sediments that are largely composed of negatively charged clay particles. Because diquat is a cationic herbicide, it is strongly adsorbed by these clays, potentially rendering it unavailable for plant uptake. Adsorption of diquat is dependent upon amount and type of clay present {{in the water column}} (Weber et al. 1965, Narine and Guy 1982) ...|$|E
40|$|MSc., Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, 2011 This {{research}} {{investigated the}} susceptibility of South African indigenous aquatic plants to competition from invasive species, using the competitive interactions of {{two sets of}} aquatic plants as a potential indicator. These interactions were studied in two separate experiments: the <b>submersed</b> <b>weeds,</b> Hydrilla verticillata (L. F.) Royle (Hydrocharitaceae) and an indigenous species, Lagarosiphon major (Ridley) Moss (Hydrocharitaceae) and; the floating weeds, Azolla filiculoides Lamarck (Azollaceae) and the indigenous Spirodela polyrhiza (L.) Schleid (Lemnaceae). Plants were grown under differing nutrient levels, and in an addition series of eight different densities, using the reciprocal yield model to estimate competitive ability. The invasive Hydrilla outcompeted Lagarosiphon in terms of mean length, dry mass, and survival. Major algal infestation in the high nutrient level of the Hydrilla/Lagarosiphon experiment altered light and nutrient conditions, which {{may have played a}} significant role in the lack of establishment of Lagarosiphon and the poor growth performance of Hydrilla. The invasive Azolla and indigenous Spirodela both performed well in terms of plant mass and increase in number. While Azolla was affected by intraspecific competition, it showed a steady increase in growth and multiplication with an increase in nutrients. The individual mass of Spirodela plants was highest in the low nutrient level, and multiplication rates were greatest in the high nutrient level. Results indicate that the susceptibility of indigenous plants may be increased in highnutrient systems, and that a continuous monitoring programme of aquatic alien species is vital in protecting our indigenous plants from extinction. This research recommends that the method of investigating competitive interactions between alien and indigenous plants be repeated with a variety of aquatic plants, as a means of anticipating susceptibility to invasions...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{potential}} for herbicide dispersion from treated sites can cause concerns regarding {{the impact on}} desirable floating-leaf and emergent vegetation. There are many scenarios where targeted <b>submersed</b> invasive <b>weeds</b> and non-target floating-leaf and emergent plants grow in close proximity. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the effects of submersed applications of the auxin-mimicking herbicides 2, 4 -D and triclopyr, on spatterdock (Nuphar lutea (L.) Sm.), American bulrush (Schoenoplectus americanus Pers.), and soft-stem bulrush (S. tabernaemontani (C. C. Gmel.) Palla). Use rates and exposures that provide control of the submersed invasive Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) were evaluated against these valuable non-target emergent species. BACKGROUND: Spatterdock and bulrush species are ecologically important shoreline plants in many Midwestern lakes. They provide valuable habitat for fish and invertebrates. The seeds are a food source for waterfowl and the rhizomes are eaten by muskrats, beaver, and porcupines (Borman et. al 1997). Spatterdock and bulrush species are often found mixed with or in close proximity to the invasive submersed plant Eurasian watermilfoil. Submersed applications of 2, 4 -D (both the ester and amine formulations) and triclopyr are commonly used to control Eurasian watermilfoil and there is concern that these applications may cause unintended damage to non-target emergent and floating...|$|R
