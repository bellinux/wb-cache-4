5|$|Workmen {{discover}} a pre-human skull while {{building in the}} fictional Hobbs Lane (formerly Hob's Lane, Hob being an antiquated name for the Devil) in Knightsbridge, London. Dr Matthew Roney, a paleontologist, examines the remains and reconstructs a dwarf-like humanoid with a large brain volume, which he believes to be a primitive man. As further excavation is undertaken, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> like a missile is unearthed; further work by Roney's group is halted because the military {{believe it to be}} an unexploded Second World War bomb.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} of the season six finale, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) are desperately {{attempting}} to find the truth behind the so-called alien object. Meanwhile, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still imprisoned by his own frenetic brain activity. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Skinner are unaware of FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley's (Mimi Rogers) duplicity—she is working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). Scully then travels to Africa to unravel the secrets of the alien artifacts, finding <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> like a spaceship buried under the shoreline off the Côte d'Ivoire coast. The object may prove that life originated elsewhere, and all religion is based on the Navajo contact with alien life. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder in Washington, D.C., but instead she finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. Cigarette Smoking Man has taken Mulder to a place where all his problems seem to have disappeared. Fowley helps Scully locate Mulder, which leads to her death at the hands of Cigarette Smoking Man.|$|E
25|$|On {{their second}} expedition, they {{reported}} that they found <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> like a staircase and a round black hole that goes directly into the structure.|$|E
50|$|Mold It - {{the giver}} used play-doh to make <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> like the word.|$|R
60|$|The detective eyed Philip steadfastly. There {{was just}} the shadow of <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> like admiration in his hard, grey eyes.|$|R

500|$|Critics {{gave the}} game's {{technical}} achievements a lukewarm reception. [...] Several reviewers described the Electron engine as aging; IGN Australia said [...] "The two year-old engine is surprisingly sluggish for <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> dated. The simplistic Overhead Map adds {{nothing to the}} visual attractiveness, but this isn't a bad-looking game". [...] GameZone referred to the graphics as [...] "serviceable", and IGN said [...] "The world map is a bit ugly, but otherwise Storm of Zehir looks slightly better than its predecessors". [...] Critics widely panned the voice acting, but praised the music.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960 Lichtenstein {{characterized}} {{his inspiration}} as follows: [...] "Although I had played {{with this idea}} before, {{it started with a}} comic book image of a mad artist crossing out, with a large brushstroke 'X,' the face of a friend that was haunting him. ...Then I went on to do paintings of brushstroke alone. I was very interested in characterizing or caricaturing a brushstroke..." [...] He has also described this series as follows: [...] "t's taking something that originally was suppose to mean immediacy and I'm tediously drawing <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> like a brushstroke...I want it to look as though it were painstaking." [...] In the 1990s, he described his inspiration in more artistic terms ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the closing}} reveal {{involving}} Melisandre, {{the director of}} the episode stated that a similar technique to the body double of Cersei Lannister in [...] "Mother's Mercy" [...] was used, with Carice van Houten wearing prosthetic makeup for the face that was then transposed onto the real body of an old woman. Podeswa stated, [...] "The idea is there's an indefinite indeterminate quality that she could be ancient. We were limited by choosing to use a real person rather than a complete [...] creation. Because what does a 400-year-old person look like? We don't know. So if you try to create that, then you're creating <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> beyond our known reality. Here you feel like she's very old without putting a number on it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true. But yesterday, when I rode up to {{the edge}} of this timber, I caught sight of <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> very much like the white mustang." ...|$|R
60|$|The Arab {{said this}} so earnestly--at {{the same time}} {{producing}} a sixpence, or <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> like one, from his pockets--that the provincial boy's rising suspicions were quite disarmed.|$|R
60|$|The {{other one}} {{sat on a}} tuft of grass, eating <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> very nice; but, all of a sudden, she dropped her bowl, and ran away, looking very much frightened.|$|R
500|$|After {{the success}} of {{previous}} live-action promotional shorts, Landfall and The Life, 343 Industries, the studio in charge of development for the Halo franchise, wanted to use a live action series to appeal {{to an audience of}} people unfamiliar with the Halo games. The director of franchise business management at 343 Industries, Matt McClosky, explained the intended audience by saying that, [...] "You see <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> like a video game, you're going to get the same crowd you always get." [...] The live-action format was also chosen for its ability to better develop characters; the series is used to introduce the character Thomas Lasky to the Halo universe before his role in the video game Halo 4. The developers wanted a protagonist with more emotion than Master Chief (whose face is never seen), to not only convey an understanding of the universe, but to better engage unfamiliar viewers.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{liked the}} site {{so much that}} he did not even visit an {{alternative}} site in Hyde Park; he felt that the sculpture might have been lost in such a big park, recalling an experience he had trying to find the sculpture Riva by Jacob Epstein in the park. He welcomed the fact that the sculpture would be next to a public path and would have seating nearby to allow contemplation, and compared the gardens favourably with the setting for Hubert Le Sueur’s equestrian statue of Charles I at Charing Cross, “which, in order to look at closely and appreciate in detail, you have to risk your life in crossing a maze of traffic”. The siting of the sculpture was disliked by some, with Neil Marten MP asking Parliament why [...] "this lovely part of Westminster should be littered with <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> like a crashed unidentified flying object." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{supposedly}} traditional English {{dishes are}} relatively new {{and can be}} dated to the century, and sometimes to the year, of their introduction. Thus piccalilli was introduced from India in the 18th century, as recorded by Hannah Glasse who gave a recipe for it in 1758. Conversely, dishes and sauces still considered foreign, such as fish in sweet and sour sauce, have been in English recipe books since the Middle Ages. Other dishes took their present form only gradually, as with the so-called [...] "Full English breakfast". Breakfasts of this kind are indeed described in later editions of [...] "Mrs Beeton", but as one of many variations. Thus her list of [...] "Family Breakfasts for a Week in Winter" [...] has for Wednesday <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> fairly modern: [...] "bread, muffins, butter, brawn, grilled bacon, boiled eggs"; but on other days less modern-looking breakfasts include mince, mutton cutlets, grilled kidneys, baked fresh herrings, and hash of cold game or poultry, while suggestions for [...] "Family Breakfasts for a Week in Summer" [...] included sardine toast, cold tongue, kedgeree and rissoles, and [...] "Guests' Breakfast (Autumn)" [...] included cold pheasant, game pie, and pressed beef.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well then, to {{show how}} right you are, there's the young lady." [...] He pointed to an object {{on one of the}} tables, a small {{photograph}} with a very wide border of <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> like crimson fur.|$|R
50|$|While Microsoft offered <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> like a fully {{integrated}} office suite in Microsoft Office, a common complaint about early Windows versions of WordPerfect Office was <b>that</b> it <b>looked</b> like {{a collection of}} separate applications from different vendors cobbled together, with inconsistent user interfaces from one application to another.|$|R
60|$|Then Bickley {{discovered}} <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> {{like the}} mouth of a well down which he nearly tumbled, and Bastin began to complain that he was hot and very thirsty; also to point out that he wished for no more caves and idols at present.|$|R
500|$|Appearing {{in series}} two, Ianto assists {{the team in}} field {{missions}} and {{is used by the}} writers as a vehicle for one-liner jokes. Commenting on this, portrayer Gareth David-Lloyd notes that [...] "This season it's much more relaxed and he's not all about keeping secrets, he's about Torchwood and Jack— he's found his meaning and his place so his dry humour comes out a lot more and he's happier." [...] The developments in Ianto's character were also reflected in the wardrobe choice. [...] "For series two," [...] comments Ray Holman, [...] "we evolved the look quite a lot, and now his suits {{come from all over the}} place. It's just a question of where I see <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> right for Gareth, so I've brought him a suit from Savile Row and suits from Zara and Next. We realised we could be a bit more flash with Ianto now he's come out of the background and started to assert himself a bit more. So we moved him into coloured shirts and snazzier ties. He started off in white and grey shirts but we realised his skin tones can take the extra colour and now he's evolving into something much sharper, which looks really good filmed in high definition." ...|$|E
500|$|Rick Massimo, {{reviewing}} the concert for The Providence Journal, wrote {{that as a}} musical theater, the Monster Ball was not that exciting, but [...] "that leaves the music, and when you lay two hours of her songs end-to-end, it's easy to see the vision, the intelligence and a serious songwriting talent at work." [...] Jay N. Miller from The Enterprise {{was impressed with the}} show, saying that the music was somewhere between industrial disco and house music with a rock edge, but [...] "always danceable". Philip Borof from Bloomberg Television reviewed the concert in New York's Madison Square Garden and found it average, calling the crowd decked in various costumes as the [...] "most entertaining". Toronto Stars Ben Rayner appreciated the show, exclaiming [...] "hot damn, that was one hell of a show Gaga brought to the Air Canada Centre Sunday night and suddenly it doesn’t seem redundant to add one more voice to the Lady Gaga choir." [...] Mariel Concepción from Billboard felt that Gaga [...] "may be best known for her gaudy outfits and over-the-top stage shows, but at her hometown headlining debut at Madison Square Garden last night, the pop phenomenon proved she's a regular girl at heart." [...] The Seattle Times staff writer Marian Liu declared that as [...] "one of the most anticipated touring acts of the year, [...] stimulated the crowd's senses on Saturday night in a way few artists can. She brought spectacle and backed it up with soul." [...] The Guardian journalist Alexis Petridis reviewed the opening show of the European leg, and commented that [...] "it takes a certain je ne sais quoi to open your show doing <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> suspiciously like mime on a rickety metal staircase while wearing an outfit with shoulderpads the size of the deck on a small aircraft carrier." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some pundits {{found the}} need to {{distinguish}} Boman from the former National Hockey League Coach, William Scott Bowman, who was also known as [...] "Scotty Bowman". [...] A photo of the banner from his website appeared in the Detroit Free Press with the caption: [...] "Scotty Boman, a Libertarian candidate in Michigan's senatorial race, {{is not related to}} THE Scotty Bowman. He wants to make that perfectly clear by putting <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> like a Red Wings jersey on his Web site." ...|$|E
50|$|Though their {{cover is}} {{eventually}} exposed, the Doctor and Ace manage to evade Hemmings {{and get back}} to the TARDIS. Before they leave 1951, Ace catches a glimpse of Hemmings entering <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> like the Doctor's TARDIS, which disappeared with the same familiar TARDIS sound.|$|R
50|$|During {{the second}} phase of trance people try {{to make sense of the}} entoptic phenomena. They would {{elaborate}} the shape they had 'seen' until they had created <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> familiar to them. Shamans experiencing {{the second phase}} of trance would incorporate the natural world into their entoptic phenomena, visualising honeycombs or other familiar shapes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} would have, laddie, when I saw you getting away with the liquid last night. An X-ray {{photograph}} of your liver would show <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> like a crumpled oak-leaf studded with hob-nails. You ought to take more exercise, dear heart. Except for sloshing that policeman, you haven't done anything athletic for years." ...|$|R
2500|$|The case of {{the radical}} 艸 (U+8278) proves how {{arbitrary}} the state of affairs is. When used to compose characters like 草 (U+8349), the radical was placed at the top, but had two different forms. Traditional Chinese and Korean use a four-stroke version. At the top of 草 should be <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> like [...] "+ +". Simplified Chinese, Kyūjitai Japanese and Shinjitai Japanese use a three-stroke version (艹). The PRC's text encoding bodies did not encode the two variants differently. The fact that almost every other change {{brought about by the}} PRC, no matter how minor, did warrant a unique codepoint suggests that this exception may have been unintentional. Unicode copied the existing standards as is, preserving such irregularities.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, recent {{industry}} trends suggest the reemergence of <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> very like the traditional A-B split in major studio production, though with fewer [...] "programmers" [...] bridging the gap. According to a 2006 report by industry analyst Alfonso Marone, [...] "The average budget for a Hollywood movie is currently around $60m, rising to $100m when {{the cost of}} marketing for domestic launch (USA only) is factored into the equation. However, we are now witnessing a polarisation of film budgets into two tiers: large productions ($120–150m) and niche features ($5–20m). The rationale is that the likelihood of success is maximised by coupling ultra-large budget and highly marketable features (e.g., [...] ), with multiple low-cost bets (e.g., Little Miss Sunshine). Fewer $30–70m releases are expected." ...|$|E

60|$|They {{walked along}} the hill, and at last came to <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> {{a little like a}} trail. Then they went forward once more, {{covering}} a good mile.

5000|$|... “I {{wanted it}} {{to look like a}} movie, not like a vamped up, {{over-the-top}} music video or a movie in a video, but actually <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> like it was from a spy film. I felt it was this great culmination of movie, ideas and visuals all put together into this song created by Demi Lovato.” ...|$|R
60|$|Reddy Fox {{sprang up}} as if some one had stuck a pin into him. Every hair stood on end, as {{he looked up at}} Unc' Billy's doorway. Then his teeth began to chatter with fright.

6000|$|... "Every man," [...] said he, {{with some}} dignity, [...] "has got his lamps on <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> good to him. With you, it's this dame that you're {{afraid to say}} your say to. With me, it was to win out in the ring. Well, you'll lose just like I did." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a long, {{handsome}} {{bridge over}} the river, and when they had got {{to the other side}} of it they again travelled on a long, long way, and then once more the Foal inquired if Cinderlad saw anything.

5000|$|... "The {{goal was}} to {{understand}} who he was. It was not to write a slash-and-burn Glenn Beck is a Big Fat Idiot book.

60|$|He {{opened the}} linen case, which was, by the bye, secured by a padlock, and drew out what was, to all appearance, an {{ordinary}} fishing-rod, fitted {{at the end}} with <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> like an iron hand.
