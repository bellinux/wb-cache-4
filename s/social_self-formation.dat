40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to study the {{significance}} of such factors as communicative competence in the professional <b>social</b> worker and <b>self-formation</b> of future professionals. The article analyzed the content and problems of efficient formation professional competence of social workers, in particular features of communicative competence, the implementation of speech specialist; considers different interpretations of communicative competence; skills of verbal and nonverbal communication in the dialogic process of training future social workers. The main components of communicative competence considered: perceptual and interactive, which consist {{in the ability to}} build relationships, to perceive and understand the customers' interests and seek verbal speech and nonverbal interaction through dialogue approach. The process of non-verbal dialogue defined in two aspects: 1) non-verbal communication; 2) sign language, which is necessary to work with deaf-mute people. In Ukraine are more than 3 million deaf-mute people. The professionals education of social workers reviewed, which shows not always correlate learning with social, cultural, political and psychological realities. In the future professionals in social work during their training in higher education is developing skills of non-verbal dialogue through sign language, which creates a barrier in providing highly qualified and effective assistance to people with hearing problems. ? ?????? ??????????? ????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ?????????????? ? ???????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ??????????? ?????????, ? ????????? ??????????? ???????? ??????????????? ??????????????; ??????? ??????????? ? ????????????? ?????????????? ??????? ? ???????? ???????????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????????...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, two {{fundamental}} questions are posed: (1) what is emotion, and (2) what part does it {{play in the}} <b>social</b> processes of <b>self-formation</b> and self-realization? How do we as behaving beings, who experience sensations, become interacting beings, who experience emotions? And, how are our emotional experiences related to {{who we are and}} our ability to acquire a positive relation to ourselves? By attempting to answer these questions I point out the social conditions that are necessary to enable emotional experiences, and in turn self-formation and self-realization. The focus is on the form, rather than on the content of the emotional self. From the developed neo-Meadian perspective on the emotional self, emotion is understood as a phenomenon linked to both mind and body, without being explained as a mind-body combination. It is argued that emotional experiences are (1) corporal evaluations of our interchanges with the outer world, especially, the other, and (2) crucial to who we are or want to be. An introduction to the neo-Meadian theory of the emotional self is presented in a general manner by including notions of the social self and emotion as social. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, I suggest that diverse phenomena in the <b>social</b> process of <b>self-formation</b> and self-realization is explained by a view that has its roots in the classic social psychology of Adam Smith, Charles Horton Cooley, and, especially, George Herbert Mead. The view consists of three salient ideas: (1) the self does not emerge without the other or society, (2) it is from the point of view of the other or society that the self develops, and (3) self-realization involves a need for recognition. In the second part of the dissertation, I expand the view on emotion as social that is incorporated in the classic social psychology by investigating the recently established field of the sociology of emotions. Once the general structure of the notion of the social self and emotion as social is shown and provided with a preliminary defense, different modifications are considered. In the third part of the dissertation, both the classic social psychology and the sociology of emotions are modified to become more accurate. I elaborate on Mead’s distinction between social behavior, in the form of (1) functional identification, and social interaction, in form of (2) attitude taking of the thing from which he means that self-feeling arises, and (3) attitude taking of the other from which he means that self-reflexion arises...|$|R
40|$|Anxieties {{regarding}} {{colonial and}} neoliberal education have generated multiple calls for critical international pedagogies. Scholars of critical pedagogy have analyzed the pedagogies of the neoliberal project, whose ethos and economic imperatives aim to produce apolitical consumers and future citizens. Such calls, this article argues, articulate {{a concern about}} other-regardedness, critiquing the impact of neoliberalism on the cultivation of student values and relations toward politics, society, and others. How can we articulate a critical international pedagogy informed by, and enhancing, students’ and future citizens’ other-regardedness toward those “superfluous” and “disposable” others outside the classroom and the formal curriculum? To this end, we mobilize Michel Foucault’s thinking of “counter-conduct” to illuminate how students resist being conducted as self-interested and apolitical consumers. Such practices remain largely unexplored in examinations of recent student protests and occupations. Examining the 2005 student occupation of a French university against the local government’s abandonment of asylum-seekers, we discuss students’ own processes of <b>social</b> participation and <b>self-formation,</b> thus exploring the possibilities and tensions for advancing a critical and other-regarding pedagogy. Greater attention to students resisting the historically blind and market-driven rationalities and techniques of governing—inside and outside classrooms and curricula—marks an important {{point of departure for}} critical pedagogies of the international...|$|R
