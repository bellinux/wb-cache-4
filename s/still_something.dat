25|$|During his centenary in 1903, while {{receiving}} {{attention from}} all leading musical reference books, {{he was still}} not generally accepted as {{being one of the}} great composers. Some of his music was still in neglect and his following was smaller than other, mainly German, composers. Even half a century did not change much, and it took until the 1960s for the right questions to be asked about his work, and for it to be viewed in a more balanced and sympathetic light. One of the pivotal events in this fresh ignition of interest in the composer was a performance of Les Troyens by Rafael Kubelík in 1957 at Covent Garden. The music of Berlioz enjoyed a revival during the 1960s and 1970s, {{due in large part to}} the efforts of French conductor Charles Munch and of British conductor Sir Colin Davis, who recorded his entire oeuvre, bringing to light a number of Berlioz's lesser-known works. An unusual (but telling) example of the increase of Berlioz's fame in the 1960s was an explosion of forged autographs, manuscripts, and letters, evidently created to cater for a much greater interest in the composer. Davis's recording of Les Troyens was the first near-complete recording of that work. The work, which Berlioz never saw staged in its entirety during his life, is now a part of the international repertoire, if <b>still</b> <b>something</b> of a rarity. Les Troyens was the first opera performed at the newly built Opéra Bastille in Paris on 17 March 1990 in a production claimed to be complete, but lacking the ballets.|$|E

This sense of completeness is most closely related to the construction of the reals from surreal numbers, since that construction starts with a proper class that contains every ordered field (the surreals) and then selects from it the largest Archimedean subfield.|$|E

2500|$|While it is <b>still</b> <b>something</b> of a niche market, a few {{companies}} {{have begun to}} produce and market small sponges as reusable feminine hygiene products. They are marketed under the brand names Sea Pearls in the United States and Jam Sponge in the United Kingdom. The sponges are inserted into the vagina {{in much the same}} way a tampon is, but when full are removed, cleaned, and reused, rather than discarded. The advantages of a reusable tampon alternative include cost-effectiveness and waste reduction. (Since sponges are biodegradable, even when a menstrual sponge's absorbent life is over it can be composted.) Some women are also concerned by the health risks associated with traditional tampons and feel it is healthier to use a natural material. [...] While no known cases of toxic shock syndrome have been associated with the use of menstrual sponges, sponges are known to contain sand, grit and bacteria, and thus the possibility of toxic shock syndrome must be considered. Sponges have a greater capacity for absorbing menstrual flow than most tampons; though they should still be changed at least every eight hours.|$|E
