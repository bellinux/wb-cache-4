Eno selected them on the basis that he thought they were incompatible with each other musically. He stated that he [...] "got them together merely because I wanted to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> you combine different identities like that and allow them to compete... is organized with the knowledge that there might be accidents, accidents which will be more interesting than what I had intended".|$|E
500|$|According to Metcalfe, during Mercedes' {{hospitalisation}} and recuperation she [...] "starts {{putting it}} on to get sympathy. She's determined to get what she wants". Metcalfe explained that Mercedes did not [...] "feel guilt at all - she just wants Riley back and she'll {{do whatever it takes}} to get him". Metcalfe believed that it was easy for Mercedes to lie; [...] "hence why she does it so much and so well!" [...] Mercedes felt that she had to lie, and found it easy to cry if she needed to, [...] "especially if it will benefit her". Metcalfe was unsure whether the audience would start to hate her character because she believed that Mercedes was not hateful. She stated, [...] "I hope I've done a good job and people still feel sorry for her". She said that [...] "the viewers have still been feeling some sympathy for Mercedes. I was getting lots of tweets saying, 'I feel so sorry for Mercedes, she needs to get back with Riley' and 'Mitzeee is being a bitch'". Metcalfe said that she was surprised by the fans' strong reaction. Hollyoaks executive producer Emma Smithwick also said that Mercedes [...] "gets away with blue murder [...] and yet there's so much love for that character". Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Mercedes would get her comeuppance for framing Mitzeee, saying: [...] "there most definitely will be a comeuppance. With the stabbing, she did it so coolly and lied about it so easily - that can't last forever". Smithwick explained that Mercedes is [...] "driven by her insecurities. She thinks she loves Riley and will do what it takes to win him. That's what it's about...winning. Mitzeee crossed her - she is dispensable but Riley...well, Riley is the prize. Mercedes Fisher usually gets what she wants and men usually fall in line with her. I want to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> they don't..." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Marshall Mathers LP was {{recorded}} in a two-month-long [...] "creative binge", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions. Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording {{in order to stay}} focused on working and figuring out how to [...] "map out" [...] each song. He described himself as a [...] "studio rat" [...] who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio. Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, [...] "We don't wake up at two in the morning, call each other, and say, 'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio. ' We just wait and <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> we get there. [...] " [...] Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from [...] "fucking around" [...] in the studio; [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while [...] "Criminal" [...] was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. [...] "Kill You" [...] was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.|$|E
2500|$|Bryant Frazer of Studio Daily {{wrote that}} Godard breaks the {{conventional}} [...] "rules" [...] of 3D in five ways: [...] "he does not keep a clean frame" [...] in his screen compositions, [...] "he embraces low-quality cameras", [...] "he gravitates toward deep focus" [...] cinematography, [...] "he rips the 3D image apart and then restores it {{in a single}} shot" [...] and [...] "he uses stereo to elevate the mundane" [...] instead of spectacular subjects like superhero or fantasy films. Frazer said that Godard [...] "wants to experiment with the technology, draw attention to it, test its boundaries, and <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> the image falls apart completely." [...] Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote that [...] "rather than using 3-D as an effect to create a sensation of flight or to make a viewer feel like the target of propelled objects, Godard uses 3-D to emphasize the materiality, the physical properties, of the world at hand." [...] Bordwell said that, other than [...] "to awe us with special effects", 3D's purposes are typically to be realistic in its enhancement of the depth of objects and [...] "advancing {{our understanding of the}} story", which is usually achieved with only one part of the screen in 3D while the rest is out of focus and in 2D. In Goodbye to Language Godard uses 3D in deep focus shots with images that allow the audience to scan the entire frame. Bordwell wrote that Godard's use of 3D [...] "is aiming to make us perceive the world stripped of our conceptual constructs (language, plot, normal viewpoints, and so on)." ...|$|E

When he heard gunshots he left the premises. In the eyes of many whites, however, Moss' position as a postman and the president of the co-op made him a ringleader of the conspiracy.

She snapped all her checks like pack-thread, and went for the tugs in attendance like a fury. Before anybody could see what she was up to she sent one of them to the bottom, and laid up another for three months' repairs. One of her cables parted, and then, suddenly--you couldn't tell why--she let herself be brought up with the other as quiet as a lamb.|$|E

Sandwiched between American and Red Army lines, the 500, 000 inhabitants were cut off from the outside world and left to fend for themselves in the face of crippling shortages of food, fuel and housing. Gareth Pritchard charts how groups of Communists, Socialists and antifascists came together to form ’antifascist’ committees which seized power and set about restoring order, ensuring the supply of food and essential services and hunting down, disarming and arresting fugitive Nazis. This is not only a fascinating history in its own right but it also sheds important new light on the fate of Germany after 1945.
