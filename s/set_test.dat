2500|$|Monty Bowden became England's {{youngest}} ever Test captain aged 23 years 144 {{days in the}} Second Test at Newlands, Cape Town, replacing {{an injured}} Smith in Bowden's second and final Test. Bowden won the toss and chose to bat. 120 from opener Bobby Abel helped England to 292 all out on the first day. The South Africans then lost a quick wicket to finish day one on 2 for 1. South Africa were then totally humiliated on the second day. Johnny Briggs took 7 for 17 (six bowled) as South Africa fell to 47, although Bernard Tancred became the first batsman to carry his bat in a Test in reaching 26 not out, the only score in the innings in double figures. They then followed-on, with Briggs then taking 8 for 11 in the second innings as the hosts were all out for 43. Briggs's second innings wickets were all bowled, setting a Test record that still has not been bettered. [...] He also <b>set</b> <b>Test</b> records for the number wickets in an innings (8) and a match (15), both later surpassed. [...] The other two wickets were one bowled (Arnold Fothergill) and one run out, making this the only instance of 9 batsmen being bowled in a Test innings.|$|E

40|$|Background: Analysis of {{microarray}} experiments {{often involves}} testing for the overrepresentation of pre-defined sets of genes among lists of genes deemed individually significant. Most popular gene <b>set</b> <b>testing</b> methods assume {{the independence of}} genes within each set, an assumption that is seriously violated, as extensive correlation between genes is a well-documented phenomenon. Results: We conducted a meta-analysis of over 200 datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus in order to demonstrate the practical impact of strong gene correlation patterns that are highly consistent across experiments. We show that a common independence assumption-based gene <b>set</b> <b>testing</b> procedure produces very high false positive rates when applied to data sets for which treatment groups have been randomized, and that gene sets with high internal correlation {{are more likely to}} be declared significant. A reanalysis of the same datasets using an array resampling approach properly controls false positive rates, leading to more parsimonious and highconfidence gene set findings, which should facilitate pathway-based interpretation of the microarray data. Conclusions: These findings call into question many of the gene <b>set</b> <b>testing</b> results in the literature and argue strongly for the adoption of resampling based gene <b>set</b> <b>testing</b> criteria in the peer reviewed biomedical literature.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new static <b>test</b> <b>set</b> {{compaction}} method {{based on a}} careful examination of attributes of fault coverage curves.

40|$|International audienceBackground A better {{understanding}} of the genetic architecture of complex traits can contribute to improve genomic prediction. We hypothesized that genomic variants associated with mastitis and milk production traits in dairy cattle are enriched in hepatic transcriptomic regions that are responsive to intra-mammary infection (IMI). Genomic markers [e. g. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ] from those regions, if included, may improve the predictive ability of a genomic model. ResultsWe applied a genomic feature best linear unbiased prediction model (GFBLUP) to implement the above strategy by considering the hepatic transcriptomic regions responsive to IMI as genomic features. GFBLUP, an extension of GBLUP, includes a separate genomic effect of SNPs within a genomic feature, and allows differential weighting of the individual marker relationships in the prediction equation. Since GFBLUP is computationally intensive, we investigated whether a SNP <b>set</b> <b>test</b> could be a computationally fast way to preselect predictive genomic features. The SNP <b>set</b> <b>test</b> assesses the association between a genomic feature and a trait based on single-SNP genome-wide association studies. We applied these two approaches to mastitis and milk production traits (milk, fat and protein yield) in Holstein (HOL, n =  5056) and Jersey (JER, n =  1231) cattle. We observed that a majority of genomic features were enriched in genomic variants that were associated with mastitis and milk production traits. Compared to GBLUP, the accuracy of genomic prediction with GFBLUP was marginally improved (3. 2  to  3. 9 %) in within-breed prediction. The highest increase (164. 4 %) in prediction accuracy was observed in across-breed prediction. The significance of genomic features based on the SNP <b>set</b> <b>test</b> were correlated with changes in prediction accuracy of GFBLUP (P <  0. 05). ConclusionsGFBLUP provides a framework for integrating multiple layers of biological knowledge to provide novel insights into the biological basis of complex traits, and to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction. The SNP <b>set</b> <b>test</b> might be used as a first-step to improve GFBLUP models. Approaches like GFBLUP and SNP <b>set</b> <b>test</b> will become increasingly useful, as the functional annotations of genomes keep accumulating for a range of species and traits...|$|E
