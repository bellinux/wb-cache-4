To do so, the malware requires administrative privileges. Microsoft countered their claim by asserting that if a piece of malware gains administrative privileges, it need not spoof anything, as it can commit much nastier malicious actions.|$|E

50|$|As tense as the {{situation}} in Lebanon was, ship and marines quickly settled into a routine.

The detonation of the mobile bomb destroyed the headquarters, killed 241 men and injured over 100 others.
