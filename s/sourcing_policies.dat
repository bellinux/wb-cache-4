40|$|Excerpt] <b>Sourcing</b> <b>policy</b> refers, generally, to {{determining}} which sector—public (government) or private—will perform an agency’s function(s). Both federal employees and contractor employees have valid roles {{to play in}} performing {{the work of the}} federal government. This combined workforce is known as a blended workforce. Determining which sector will perform which functions, including determining when federal employee performance is, or should be, required can be challenging, however. Efforts to address this issue, and related questions, {{have been the subject of}} the federal government’s <b>sourcing</b> <b>policy</b> since at least the 1950 s. This report begins with a history of <b>sourcing</b> <b>policy</b> that focuses on the terms commercial and inherently governmental, and the policy of government reliance on the private sector. The following section examines the two strains of sourcing policy: competitive sourcing and multi-sector workforce management.

40|$|The {{quality of}} most fresh {{products}} deteriorates {{as a function}} of environmental conditions and time, resulting in reduced market value and ultimately in product waste. Although product spoilage significantly impacts the performance of perishable supply chains often supply chain design strategies do not sufficiently account for the perishable product nature. One such strategy is dual sourcing, a common practice adopted in supply chain management to enhance sourcing flexibility while reducing transportation costs. In this paper we examine the use of a common dual sourcing strategy, the dual-index policy, in an international strawberry supply chain. We propose to incorporate costs for expected losses of product quality in dual-index order policy parameters. Costs for product quality decay are determined using expected shelf life reductions during transport and storage steps in the supply chain, predicted using microbiological growth models of a spoilage driver. The performance of the different dual-index strategies is assessed using a discrete event chain simulation model that includes continuous quality decay. The scenario analysis of this strawberry supply chain revealed that standard dual-index <b>sourcing</b> <b>policies</b> are ineffective in delivering a sufficient product quality with reasonable waste, resulting in large amounts of product waste. Furthermore findings indicate that use of product quality information in dual-index <b>sourcing</b> <b>policies</b> significantly improves chain performance...|$|E

40|$|Codes {{of conduct}} {{have become the}} perhaps most often used tool to manage {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR).

40|$|Some {{companies}} are heavily reliant on {{the capabilities of}} their manufacturing technology for product competitiveness.

This research finds that there is a preference amongst the US organizations studied not to become involved with equipment manufacture, though some examples of full integration do occur. These policies are not determined by formalized decision processes, rather they are formed implicitly during technology choice. In this research, factors that influence a technology source have been identified. These drivers are then used to establish a methodology that will help practising managers to form a technology sourcing decision. This methodology takes into account the business demands placed on a technology, along with the characteristics of the host company's supplier base...|$|E
40|$|Problem: Disasters cause massive {{destruction}} and their occurrence (even though declining {{since the last}} years) is still a topic of high actuality. To mitigate their negative impacts, in particular humanitarian organizations {{put a lot of}} effort into helping nations and people to recover from disasters by providing relief commodities. Responding adequately to a disaster is difficult due to its highly complex and uncertain nature. Flexible but efficient supply chains are needed, which makes high demands on procurement operations. Within disaster relief logistics, procurement accounts for 65 % of total expenditures. Despite its significance, literature does not specifically focus on problems related to disaster relief procurement, which creates the need to examine this topic further, from theory as well as from practice. Purpose: The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe and analyze <b>sourcing</b> <b>policies,</b> currently applied by the largest humanitarian organizations in the field of disaster relief. Method: This thesis conducted a descriptive and exploratory study of the literature in order to create a framework for a content analysis. During the content analysis, 108 officially published reports of the 14 biggest humanitarian organizations (concerning their annual budget) were investigated concerning their procurement policies in disaster response operations. Hence, this study uses a qualitative approach for a cross-sectional analysis of secondary data. Conclusions: The findings of this paper present an overview of currently applied procurement concepts in disaster response. The compilation of a comprehensive sourcing toolbox allows the classification of <b>sourcing</b> <b>policies.</b> The results show a tendency, that similar procurement policies are applied in the largest humanitarian organizations regarding the area of sourcing or the number of suppliers. A lack of awareness and/or transparency was discovered regarding environmentally friendly procurement policies. The application of ethical procurement (social factors) is however highly emphasized by the organizations. An unexpected discovery was the importance of long-term agreements and the frequent application of tendering processes for supplier selection. Further research opportunities lie in the field of demand tailored sourcing instead of pre-stocking to reduce inventory costs or in the comparison of sourcing practices applied in big and small organizations. To sum up, humanitarian organizations not only focus on quick deliveries, also quality and cost efficiency are increasingly paid attention in the field of disaster response procurement...|$|E
40|$|Modern supply {{chains are}} international, complex, dynamic {{networks}} that {{are subject to}} uncertainty, vulnerability, large time-lags, and variability in delivery. One {{of the main reasons}} that have made supply chain networks more vulnerable is the raise of lean or JIT manufacturing practices. Those approaches are to eliminate all the wastes in supply chains and focus greatly on cost reduction by centralising the assets, reducing the supplier base or decreasing the stocks dramatically. However, the benefits must be weighed and balanced against the future risks of disruptions and costs. Furthermore, since <b>sourcing</b> <b>policy</b> is closely relative to supply chain continuity and security, this study examines how sourcing decisions in one large-scale leather manufacturing organisation could help mitigate supply chain disruption risks, focusing on identifying and examining key factors which have great impact on sourcing decision making processes to figure out the most appropriate <b>sourcing</b> <b>policy</b> for organisations to mitigate supply chain disruption risks. It is suggested from this study that organisations should examine external and internal potential risks to build a risk awareness culture across the networks and to introduce flexibility for more resilient supply chain networks. Since disruption risks are unpredictable and inevitable, organisations should embrace them and tackle them properly. Proper preparation before occurrences would mitigate the harm brought along by supply chain disruptions. In addition, from the research and the case study of Prime Asia Group, it is concluded that (i) <b>sourcing</b> <b>policy</b> and <b>sourcing</b> decisions {{play a significant role in}} protecting supply chain against disruption risks; (ii) the essential variables derived from the case study are quite different from what literature proposed. (iii) However, the variables identified and analysed do help decision makers ponder on how to find a more appropriate <b>sourcing</b> <b>policy</b> to mitigate disruption risks after the evaluation of trade-offs...|$|R
