40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{classification}} of steel sheets for automotives industry {{on the basis of}} strength and structural characteristics. Experimental works were aimed to obtain the best possible strengthening parameters as well as work hardening and solid solution ferrite hardening, which are the result of thermal activation of interstitial carbon atoms during paint-baking of auto body. Hardening process coming from interstitial atoms is realized as two-step process. The first step is BH (bake hardening) effect achieved by interaction of interstitial atoms with dislocations. The Cottrels atmosphere is obtained. The second step of BH effect is to produced the hardening from precipitation of the carbon atoms in e-carbides, or formation of Fe 32 C 4 carbides. WH (work hardening) effect is obtained as dislocation hardening from plastic deformations during sheet deep drawing. Experimental works were aimed at as to achieve such plastic material properties after cold rolling, annealing and <b>skin-pass</b> <b>rolling,</b> which would be able to classify the material ZStE 220 BH into the drawing categories at the level of DQ – DDQ.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to determine residual stress distribution in sheet material from data collected in a free bending test. It may be used where the residual stress distribution is symmetrical about the mid-surface as {{it is usually the}} case for frequently-used sheet metal post-processing techniques such as <b>skin-pass</b> or temper <b>rolling,</b> tension- and roller leveling. An existing inverse technique is used to obtain a residual stress profile and material constants that provide the best fit in a finite element analysis of bending with the experimentally derived moment-curvature relation. The method is verified for bending of a low-carbon stainless steel using measurement of residual stress by X-ray diffraction. The residual stresses were induced in the sheet by cold rolling. The technique described here can be used industrially as a rapid method of investigating residual stresses in incoming sheet. In processes where the deformation is principally one of bending, such as cold roll forming, it is known that residual stresses have an influence on shape defects and springback and the method presented here can be used to determine whether incoming sheet is suitable for further processing and also as a means of obtaining improved material data input for numerical simulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{metal strip}} used in roll forming {{has often been}} preprocessed by (tension or roller) {{leveling}} or by <b>skin-pass</b> <b>rolling,</b> and as a consequence, may contain residual stresses. These stresses are not well observed by the tensile test, but could {{have a significant effect}} on the bending and springback behavior. With the advent of improved process design techniques for roll forming, including advanced finite element techniques, the need for precise material property data has become important. The major deformation mode of roll forming is that of bending combined with unloading and reverse bending, and hence property data derived from bend tests could be more relevant than that from tensile testing. This work presents a numerical study on the effect of skin passing on the material behavior of stainless steel strip in pure bending and tension. A two dimensional (2 -D) numerical model was developed using Abaqus Explicit to analyze the affect of skin passing on the residual stress profile across a section for various working conditions. The deformed meshes and their final stress fields were then imported as pre-defined fields into Abaqus Standard, and the post-skin passing material behavior in pure bending was determined. The results show that a residual stress profile is introduced into the steel strip during skin passing, and that its shape and stress level depend on the overall thickness reduction as well as the number of rolling passes used in the skin passing process. The material behavior in bending and the amount of springback changed significantly depending on the skin pass condition...|$|E
