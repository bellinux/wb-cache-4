5|$|Low-calorie sugars and {{artificial}} sweeteners are often made of maltodextrin with added sweeteners. Maltodextrin is an easily digestible synthetic polysaccharide consisting of short chains of glucose molecules and {{is made by}} the partial hydrolysis of starch. The added sweeteners are often aspartame, <b>saccharin,</b> stevia, or sucralose.|$|E
5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium <b>saccharin,</b> baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Fear about <b>saccharin</b> {{increased}} when a 1960 {{study showed that}} high levels of <b>saccharin</b> may cause bladder cancer in laboratory rats. In 1977, Canada banned <b>saccharin</b> due to the animal research. In the United States, the FDA considered banning <b>saccharin</b> in 1977, but Congress stepped in and placed a moratorium on such a ban. The moratorium required a warning label and also mandated further study of <b>saccharin</b> safety.|$|E
25|$|The delisting of <b>saccharin</b> led to {{legislation}} {{repealing the}} warning label requirement for products containing <b>saccharin.</b> In 2001, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{and the state}} of California reversed their positions on <b>saccharin,</b> declaring it safe for consumption. The FDA's decision followed a 2000 determination by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' National Toxicology Program to remove <b>saccharin</b> from its list of carcinogens.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, Food Inspection Decision 135 {{stated that}} foods {{containing}} <b>saccharin</b> were adulterated. However, in 1912, Food Inspection Decision 142 stated that <b>saccharin</b> was not harmful.|$|E
25|$|The EPA has officially removed <b>saccharin</b> and its salts {{from their}} list of {{hazardous}} constituents and commercial chemical products. In a 14 December 2010 release, the EPA stated that <b>saccharin</b> is no longer considered a potential hazard to human health.|$|E
25|$|Apart from sugar of lead (used as a {{sweetener}} {{in ancient}} through medieval times before the toxicity of lead was known), <b>saccharin</b> {{was the first}} artificial sweetener and was originally synthesized in 1879 by Remsen and Fahlberg. Its sweet taste was discovered by accident. It had been created in an experiment with toluene derivatives. A process {{for the creation of}} <b>saccharin</b> from phthalic anhydride was developed in 1950, and, currently, <b>saccharin</b> is created by this process as well as the original process by which it was discovered. It is 300 to 500 times as sweet as sugar (sucrose) and is often used to improve the taste of toothpastes, dietary foods, and dietary beverages. The bitter aftertaste of <b>saccharin</b> is often minimized by blending it with other sweeteners.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} of importing sugar from the West Indies The British <b>Saccharin</b> Company was founded in 1917 to produce <b>Saccharin</b> at its Paragon Works near Accrington, Lancashire. Production was licensed and controlled by the Board of Trade in London. Production continued on the site until 1926.|$|E
25|$|In the European Union, <b>saccharin</b> is {{also known}} by the E number (additive code) E954.|$|E
25|$|<b>Saccharin</b> was {{formerly}} on California's list of chemicals {{known to the}} state to cause cancer {{for the purposes of}} Proposition 65, but it was delisted in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Acesulfame {{potassium}} (Ace-K) is 200 times {{sweeter than}} sucrose (common sugar), {{as sweet as}} aspartame, about two thirds as sweet as <b>saccharin,</b> and one third as sweet as sucralose. Like <b>saccharin,</b> it has a slightly bitter aftertaste, especially at high concentrations. Kraft Foods has patented the use of sodium ferulate to mask acesulfame's aftertaste. Acesulfame potassium is often blended with other sweeteners (usually aspartame or sucralose), which give a more sucrose-like taste, whereby each sweetener masks the other's aftertaste and also exhibits a synergistic effect in which the blend is sweeter than its components.|$|E
25|$|Ira Remsen (February 10, 1846 â€“ March 4, 1927) was {{a chemist}} who, along with Constantin Fahlberg, {{discovered}} the artificial sweetener <b>saccharin.</b> He {{was the second}} president of Johns Hopkins University.|$|E
25|$|The {{by-products}} of {{coal gas}} manufacture included coke, coal tar, sulfur and ammonia; all useful products. Dyes, medicines, including sulfa drugs, <b>saccharin</b> and many organic compounds are therefore derived from coal gas.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from its}} use in water treatment, the other major {{application}} of KMnO4 is as a reagent for the synthesis of organic compounds. Significant amounts are required for the synthesis of ascorbic acid, chloramphenicol, <b>saccharin,</b> isonicotinic acid, and pyrazinoic acid.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the United States {{repealed}} {{the warning}} label requirement, while {{the threat of}} an FDA ban had already been lifted in 1991. Most other countries also permit <b>saccharin,</b> but restrict the levels of use, while other countries have outright banned it.|$|E
25|$|Tab was Coca-Cola's {{first attempt}} to develop a diet soft drink, using <b>saccharin</b> as a sugar substitute. Introduced in 1963, the product is still sold today, {{although}} its sales have dwindled since the introduction of Diet Coke. The Tab soft drink is difficult to locate in recent times, due to its de facto replacement by Diet Coke.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{banned the}} sale of {{cyclamate}} in 1969 after lab tests in rats involving a 10:1 mixture of cyclamate and <b>saccharin</b> that at levels comparable to humans ingesting 550 cans of diet soda per day, caused bladder cancer, a disease to which rats are particularly susceptible. Cyclamates are still used as sweeteners {{in many parts of}} the world, including Europe (e.g. UK and Russia).|$|E
25|$|Some values, such {{as those}} for maltose and glucose, vary little. Others, such as {{aspartame}} and sodium <b>saccharin,</b> have much larger variation. Regardless of variation, the perceived intensity of substances relative to each reference substance remains consistent for taste ranking purposes. The indices table for McLaughlin & Margolskee (1994) for example, {{is essentially the same}} as that of Svrivastava & Rastogi (2003), Guyton & Hall (2006), and Joesten et al. (2007). The rankings are all the same, with any differences, where they exist, being in the values assigned from the studies from which they derive.|$|E
25|$|Sweet taste {{signals the}} {{presence}} of carbohydrates in solution. Since carbohydrates {{have a very high}} calorie count (saccharides have many bonds, therefore much energy), they are desirable to the human body, which evolved to seek out the highest calorie intake foods. They are used as direct energy (sugars) and storage of energy (glycogen). However, there are many non-carbohydrate molecules that trigger a sweet response, leading to the development of many artificial sweeteners, including <b>saccharin,</b> sucralose, and aspartame. It is still unclear how these substances activate the sweet receptors and what adaptational significance this has had.|$|E
25|$|However, in 2000, {{the warning}} labels were removed because {{scientists}} learned that rodents, unlike humans, {{have a unique}} combination of high pH, high calcium phosphate, and high protein levels in their urine. One {{or more of the}} proteins that are more prevalent in male rats combine with calcium phosphate and <b>saccharin</b> to produce microcrystals that damage the lining of the bladder. Over time, the rat's bladder responds to this damage by overproducing cells to repair the damage, which leads to tumor formation. Since this does not occur in humans, there is no elevated risk of bladder cancer.|$|E
25|$|The Quaker Oats Company {{purchased}} S-VC and Gatorade in 1983 for $220 million, {{following a}} bidding war with rival Pillsbury. In its first two decades of production, Gatorade was primarily sold and distributed within the United States. Beginning in the 1980s, the company expanded distribution of Gatorade, venturing into Canada in 1984, regions of Asia in 1987, South America and parts of Europe in 1988, and Australia in 1993. In 1990, Gatorade introduced Gatorade Light, a lower-calorie version sweetened with <b>saccharin.</b> International expansion came {{at the cost of}} $20 million in 1996 alone; however the resulting efforts produced worldwide sales of $283 million in more than 45 countries during the same year. In 1997, distribution of Gatorade in an additional 10 countries prompted an 18.7 percent growth in annual sales.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} peptides, {{aspartame}} may hydrolyze (break down) into its constituent amino acids {{under conditions of}} elevated temperature or high pH. This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener, and prone to degradation in products hosting a high pH, as required for a long shelf life. The stability of aspartame under heating can be improved to some extent by encasing it in fats or in maltodextrin. The stability when dissolved in water depends markedly on pH. At room temperature, it is most stable at pH 4.3, where its half-life is nearly 300 days. At pH 7, however, its half-life {{is only a few}} days. Most soft-drinks have a pH between 3 and 5, where aspartame is reasonably stable. In products that may require a longer shelf life, such as syrups for fountain beverages, aspartame is sometimes blended with a more stable sweetener, such as <b>saccharin.</b>|$|E
500|$|Potassium nitrate (...) or {{saltpeter}} {{is obtained}} from natural {{sources such as}} guano and evaporites or manufactured via the Haber process; it is the oxidant in gunpowder (black powder) and an important agricultural fertilizer. Potassium cyanide (KCN) is used industrially to dissolve copper and precious metals, in particular silver and gold, by forming complexes. Its applications include gold mining, electroplating, and electroforming of these metals; it is also used in organic synthesis to make nitriles. Potassium carbonate ( [...] or potash) {{is used in the}} manufacture of glass, soap, color TV tubes, fluorescent lamps, textile dyes and pigments. Potassium permanganate (...) is an oxidizing, bleaching and purification substance and is used for production of <b>saccharin.</b> Potassium chlorate (...) is added to matches and explosives. Potassium bromide (KBr) was formerly used as a sedative and in photography.|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "Out from Under" [...] {{and the other}} ballads from Circus [...] "have [...] hiccuping emotion from deep {{in the back of}} her throat". Chris Richards of The Washington Post commented that the singer [...] "emerges from her media bender hoping to forget the past" [...] with the song, and Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone considered it [...] "Spears' best ballad since 'I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman'". Jon Pareles of The New York Times said [...] "Out from Under" [...] "gleam with acoustic guitars", and that the song, [...] "My Baby" [...] and [...] "Unusual You", [...] "are the album's only attempts at warmth." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic considered the song, along with [...] "My Baby", [...] "a couple of not-good-at-all ballads", while Dave Donnelly of Sputnikmusic said both [...] "subtly evoke the Britney of old: airy pop ballads that benefit from the former Frou Frou producer's sophisticated, layered arrangements." [...] While comparing Circus to Blackout, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted, [...] "the ballads are back, bringing with them the inevitable sprinkling of tedium". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club felt that both songs [...] "are about five years out of date, and [...] vocals seem anemic and distracted in spite of the confessional lyrics." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today commented that [...] "Spears tosses in a couple of ballads along , but these really aren't her forte. The slew of top-flight producers [...] bolsters her vocal variety of echoes and gimmicky effects, but they don't really help the breathy 'Out From Under' or <b>saccharin</b> 'Unusual You'". Mike Newmark of PopMatters described the song as [...] "nearly-emo" [...] along with [...] "Unusual You," [...] saying both [...] "try for heartfelt and come off flabby." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although <b>saccharin</b> was commercialized {{not long}} after its discovery, until sugar {{shortages}} during World War I, its use had not become widespread. Its popularity further increased during the 1960s and 1970s among dieters, since <b>saccharin</b> is a calorie-free sweetener. In the United States, <b>saccharin</b> is often found in restaurants in pink packets; the most popular brand is [...] "Sweet'n Low".|$|E
2500|$|The {{free acid}} of <b>saccharin</b> {{has a low}} pKa of 1.6 (the acidic {{hydrogen}} being that attached to the nitrogen). [...] <b>Saccharin</b> [...] {{can be used to}} prepare exclusively disubstituted amines from alkyl halides via a nucleophilic substitution, followed by Gabriel synthesis.|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, the United States Congress {{amended the}} Food, Drugs, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 with the Delaney clause to mandate that the Food and Drug Administration not approve {{substances}} that [...] "induce cancer in man, or, after tests, [...] found to induce cancer in animals." [...] Studies in laboratory rats {{during the early}} 1970s linked <b>saccharin</b> {{with the development of}} bladder cancer in rodents. As a consequence, all food containing <b>saccharin</b> was labeled with a warning meeting the requirement of the <b>Saccharin</b> Study and Labeling Act of 1977.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Saccharin</b> is heat stable. It {{does not}} react {{chemically}} with other food ingredients; as such, it stores well. Blends of <b>saccharin</b> with other sweeteners {{are often used}} to compensate for each sweetener's weaknesses and faults. A 10:1 cyclamate:saccharin blend is common in countries where both these sweeteners are legal; in this blend, each sweetener masks the other's off taste. [...] <b>Saccharin</b> is often used [...] with aspartame in diet carbonated soft drinks, so [...] some sweetness remains should the fountain syrup be stored beyond aspartame's relatively short shelf life.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, studies {{performed}} on laboratory rats found {{an association between}} consumption of high doses of <b>saccharin</b> {{and the development of}} bladder cancer. However, further study determined that this effect was due to a mechanism that is not relevant to humans. [...] Epidemiological studies have shown no evidence that <b>saccharin</b> is associated with bladder cancer in humans. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) originally classified <b>saccharin</b> in Group 2B ("possibly carcinogenic to humans") based on the rat studies, but downgraded it to Group 3 ("not classifiable as to the carcinogenicity to humans") upon review of the subsequent research.|$|E
2500|$|The {{current status}} of <b>saccharin</b> {{is that it is}} allowed in most {{countries}}, and countries such as Canada have lifted their previous ban of it as a food additive. The claims that it is associated with bladder cancer were shown to be unfounded in experiments on primates. (It is, however, prohibited to mail <b>saccharin</b> tablets or packets to France.) ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Saccharin</b> can be {{produced}} in various ways. [...] The original route by Remsen and Fahlberg starts with toluene; another route begins with o-chlorotoluene. Sulfonation of toluene by chlorosulfonic acid gives the ortho and para substituted sulfonyl chlorides. The ortho isomer is separated and converted to the sulfonamide with ammonia. Oxidation of the methyl substituent gives the carboxylic acid, which cyclicizes to give <b>saccharin</b> free acid: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1879 Fahlberg, {{working with}} Remsen in a post-doctoral capacity, made an {{accidental}} discovery that changed Remsen's career. [...] Eating rolls at dinner {{after a long}} day in the lab researching coal tar derivatives, Fahlberg noticed that the rolls tasted initially sweet but then bitter. Since his wife tasted nothing strange about the rolls, Fahlberg tasted his fingers and noticed that the bitter taste was probably from one of the chemicals in his lab. The next day at his lab he tasted the chemicals that he had been working with the previous day and discovered that it was the oxidation of o-toluenesulfonamide he had tasted the previous evening. He named the substance <b>saccharin</b> and he and his research partner Remsen published their finding in 1880. Later Remsen became angry after Fahlberg, in patenting <b>saccharin,</b> claimed that he alone had discovered <b>saccharin.</b> Remsen had no interest in the commercial success of <b>saccharin,</b> from which Fahlberg profited, but he was incensed at the perceived dishonesty of not crediting him {{as the head of the}} laboratory.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Saccharin</b> has no {{food energy}} and no {{nutritional}} value. [...] It {{is safe to}} consume for individuals with diabetes.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1907, the United States Food and Drug Administration began {{investigating}} <b>saccharin</b> as {{a result}} of the Pure Food and Drug Act. Harvey Wiley, then the director of the bureau of chemistry for the FDA, viewed it as an illegal substitution of a valuable ingredient (sugar) by a less valuable ingredient. In a clash that had career consequences, Wiley told President Theodore Roosevelt, [...] "Everyone who ate that sweet corn was deceived. He thought he was eating sugar, when in point of fact he was eating a coal tar product totally devoid of food value and extremely injurious to health." [...] But Roosevelt himself was a consumer of <b>saccharin,</b> and, in a heated exchange, Roosevelt angrily answered Wiley by stating, [...] "Anybody who says <b>saccharin</b> is injurious to health is an idiot." [...] The episode proved the undoing of Wiley's career.|$|E
2500|$|More {{controversy}} was {{stirred in}} 1969 {{with the discovery}} of files from the FDA's investigations of 1948 and 1949. These investigations, which had originally argued against <b>saccharin</b> use, were shown to prove little about <b>saccharin</b> being harmful to human health. In 1977, the FDA made an attempt to completely ban the substance, following studies showing that the substance caused cancer in rats. The attempted ban was unsuccessful due to public opposition that was encouraged by industry advertisements, and instead the following label was mandated: [...] "Use of this product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains <b>saccharin</b> which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals". That requirement was dropped in 2000 following new research that concluded humans reacted differently than rats and were not at risk of cancer at typical intake levels. (See also: labeling below.) The sweetener has continued to be widely used in the United States and is now the third-most popular artificial sweetener behind sucralose and aspartame.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent to this, it was {{discovered}} that <b>saccharin</b> causes cancer in male rats by a mechanism not found in humans. At high doses, <b>saccharin</b> causes a precipitate to form in rat urine. This precipitate damages the cells lining the bladder (urinary bladder urothelial cytotoxicity) and a tumor forms when the cells regenerate (regenerative hyperplasia). According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, [...] "Saccharin and its salts was [...] downgraded from Group 2B, possibly carcinogenic to humans, to Group 3, not classifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans, despite sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity to animals, because it is carcinogenic by a non-DNA-reactive mechanism that is not relevant to humans because of critical interspecies differences in urine composition." ...|$|E
