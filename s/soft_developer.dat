50|$|Yotsunoha is {{the second}} {{commercial}} project of the then dōjin <b>soft</b> <b>developer</b> Haikuo Soft, following their previous work on Sukumizu Police. Tatomu and Keikei, two writers who have previously worked on _Summer, planned the scenario used in Yotsunoha, while work on the computer graphics, in addition to character designs, were split between four members, Hīde, Xsara, Koshino and Akira Kasukabe. The music used in the game was composed solely by Ryō Kyōna.|$|E
5000|$|Recettear was {{originally}} {{developed by the}} dōjin <b>soft</b> <b>developer</b> EasyGameStation and released only in Japan. The game {{was brought to the}} Western audiences with English localization by Carpe Fulgur, a two-man development group consisting of Andrew Dice and Robin Light-Williams who had come to meet through the Something Awful forums. Dice had been interested in English translations of Japanese games and {{following in the footsteps of}} Ted Woolsey in the translation of several Square Japanese titles. After attempting to gain employment at a localization company in California, Dice contacted Light-Williams and proposed the idea of forming their own company for performing localizations. Dice saw value in the possibility of bringing Japanese titles to the West as [...] "above all what the Western gaming audience likes is a unique experience", an opportunity afforded by the growing dōjin market in Japan.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Jezz {{composed}} {{the music to}} two games by Horror Soft; Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus with Philip Nixon, and also composed the music to Waxworks. He is related to Horror <b>Soft</b> game <b>developers</b> Mike and Simon Woodroffe.|$|R
50|$|After forming Carpe Fulgur, Dice and Light-Williams {{considered}} approaching Gust Corporation, offering {{their services}} to translate games from the Atelier series, but ultimately decided against the idea. Light-Williams suggested {{the idea of}} approaching dōjin <b>soft</b> <b>developers,</b> as while titles from major Japanese developers have often been localized in English, {{there had been no}} effort for doing the same with the dōjin market. Williams specifically suggested Recettear, which had favorable word-of-mouth in Japan, and whose developers, EasyGameStation, were eager to open the game to the Western market. Though there was some trepidation due to the distance between countries and between Dice and Light-Williams (who, at the time, lived {{on opposite sides of the}} United States), EasyGameStation agreed to work with Carpe Fulgur for the translation.|$|R

30|$|<b>Developers</b> {{can create}} <b>soft</b> {{actuators}} to allow some computed commands {{to be sent}} to more than one actuator. A soft actuator groups several actuators, that have different ids and possibly different communication technologies, as one actuator. When creating a <b>soft</b> actuator, <b>developers</b> specify the number of actuators that must perform the action corresponding to the command (e.g., three lamps must be switched on).|$|R
50|$|RationalPlan is {{a project}} {{management}} software suite for planning, managing, and tracking projects. The suite is developed by Stand By <b>Soft,</b> a Romanian <b>developer</b> that specializes in desktop applications, developed the software. RationalPlan runs on multiple platforms including Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.|$|R
50|$|Kai Staats, {{founder and}} former CEO of Terra <b>Soft</b> Solutions, {{original}} <b>developer</b> of Yellow Dog Linux (YDL), was motivated {{to create a}} new communications system that combined the speed of SMS with the richness and linguistic depth of a global art project. His intent was to provide a means for communication that could bridge cultural divides. Thus, iConji is a pictographic communication system, not a spoken language.|$|R
50|$|Adventure Island began {{development}} as a direct port of the Sega arcade game Wonder Boy, the rights to which Hudson <b>Soft</b> obtained from <b>developer</b> Escape (now known as Westone Bit Entertainment). During {{the development of the}} port, {{the decision was made to}} change the character design of the protagonist, modeling him and naming him after Hudson Soft's spokesman Takahashi Meijin. In the western version of Adventure Island, the Takahashi Meijin character was renamed Master Higgins.|$|R
50|$|The {{title was}} {{originally}} built and demonstrated with touchscreen features for the Wii U, but the developers found that {{looking away from}} the main screen distracted from the game. The features were removed when the game moved to tandem development across the Wii U and Nintendo Switch. The Wii U GamePad also affected the game's animations. Though the series protagonist Link is canonically left-handed, he is right-handed in the game to match the GamePad's control scheme, which has its sword-swinging buttons on its right side. The Switch version performs better than the Wii U release when docked to a television, though when undocked, both run at the same resolution. The Switch version also has higher-quality environmental sounds. On the game's art style and direction, Aonuma stated that it was inspired by gouache and en plein air art to help identify the vast world. Monolith <b>Soft,</b> the <b>developer</b> of the similarly open-world Xenoblade Chronicles series, assisted with the game's topographical level design, {{which was based on}} Kyoto, the hometown of game director Hidemaro Fujibayashi.|$|R
30|$|More recently, {{therapeutic}} myofascial {{and soft}} tissue manipulation tools have incorporated devices that have firmer edges to increase leverage and/or vibration features to enhance effects. An evidence-based form of instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization, called the Graston® Technique (GT), utilizes a stainless-steel tool to localize and treat <b>soft</b> tissue restrictions. <b>Developers</b> of the GT {{recommend that the}} edges of the instrument be prepared at a 30 ° to 60 ° angle to more effectively and efficiently address soft tissue lesions and fascial restrictions. Studies utilizing the GT have reported producing a localized inflammatory response, reducing scar tissue, and breaking down existing scar tissue in people with soft tissue restrictions [11, 12].|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Due to voltage and {{structure}} shrinking, {{the influence of}} radiation on a circuit’s operation increases, resulting in future hardware designs exhibiting much higher rates of <b>soft</b> errors. Software <b>developers</b> {{have to cope with}} these effects to ensure functional safety. However, software-based hardware fault tolerance is a holistic property that is tricky to achieve in practice, potentially impaired by every single design decision. We present FAIL*, an open and versatile architecture-level fault-injection (FI) framework for the continuous assessment and quantification of fault tolerance in an iterative software develop-ment process. FAIL * supplies the developer with reusable and composable FI campaigns, advanced pre- and post-processing analyses to easily identify sensitive spots in the software, well-abstracted back-end implementations for several hardware and simulator platforms, and scalability of FI campaigns by providing massive parallelization. We describe FAIL*, its application to the development process of safety-critical software, and the lessons learned from a real-world example. I...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{implication}} of designing Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs), which involves complex passive and active design strategies, the use of computational automated optimization techniques is becoming more essential. Therefore, this structured interviews aims to assess gaps, needs and problems considering the integration of optimization techniques to support the design of NZEBs. This work {{is part of the}} International Energy Agency (IEA) Task 40 : Towards Net Zero Energy Buildings Subtask B. The objective of this report is to gain an understanding of how experts currently use optimization tools, which tools they use, the major limitations they have encountered, and their vision for the future of optimization of Net Zero Energy Buildings. With this information disseminated, it is anticipated that <b>soft</b> ware <b>developers</b> will be better informed of the needs of building design processionals. A qualitative study design was employed, using semi structured interviews. Optimization experts working in academia and practice were recruited. The participants were identified from the IBPSA Conference Proceedings between 1995 and 2010. A sampling framework was developed to include experts in the study from Europe and North America. These groups represented the range of possible optimization users, from researchers and designers considered optimization in the design of net zero or high performance buildings. A list of potential optimization experts was created and circulated between the IEA Task 40 Subtask members. Also every interviewed expert was asked to revise the list and add any potential candidate to be interviewed...|$|R
40|$|We study {{competitive}} interaction between two platform providers (such as two suppliers of videogame consoles or operating systems) that mediate between sellers of platform-based products (developers of games or applications) and buyers of such products (users of games or applications). Users and developers first trade {{with one of}} the platforms (users purchase videogame consoles and developers software develop-ment kits) and then with each other (users buy games from developers). We show that the unique equilibrium under platform compatibility exhibits more intense price com-petition for <b>developers,</b> <b>softer</b> price competition for users, and higher profits than the symmetric equilibrium under incompatibility (which may involve user subsidization to join a platform). Compatibility leads to higher profits because it induces more entry by developers, lower application prices, and larger user surplus that platforms cap-ture through higher user access prices. Incompatibility, however, naturally gives rise to asymmetric equilibria with a dominant platform that captures all users and earns more than in the compatible equilibrium. The model also allows a detailed analysis of social efficiency, and we show that entry by developers is socially excessive (insufficient) if competing platforms are compatible (incompatible) ...|$|R
