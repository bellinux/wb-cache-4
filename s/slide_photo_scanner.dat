40|$|DETECHIP® is a {{molecular}} sensing array used for {{identification of a}} large variety of substances. Previous methodology {{for the analysis of}} DETECHIP® used human vision to distinguish color changes induced by the presence of the analyte of interest. This paper describes several analysis techniques using digital images of DETECHIP®. Both a digital camera and flatbed desktop <b>photo</b> <b>scanner</b> were used to obtain Jpeg images. Color information within these digital images was obtained through the measurement of redgreen-blue (RGB) values using software such as GIMP, Photoshop and ImageJ. Several different techniques were used to evaluate these color changes. It was determined that the flatbed scanner produced in the clearest and more reproducible images. Furthermore, codes obtained using a macro written for use within ImageJ showed improved consistency versus pervious methods...|$|R
5000|$|Consumer-level flatbed <b>photo</b> <b>scanners</b> have {{a dynamic}} {{range in the}} 2.0-3.0 range, which can be {{inadequate}} for scanning all types of photographic film, as Dmax can be and often is between 3.0d and 4.0d with traditional black-and-white film. Color film compresses its 12 stops of a possible 16 stops (film latitude) into just 2.0d of space via the process of dye coupling and removal of all silver from the emulsion. Kodak Vision 3 has 18 stops. So, color negative film scans the easiest of all film types on the widest range of scanners. Because traditional black-and-white film retains the image creating silver after processing, density range can be almost twice that of color film. This makes scanning traditional black-and-white film more difficult and requires a scanner {{with at least a}} 3.6d dynamic range, but also a Dmax between 4.0d to 5.0d. High-end (<b>photo</b> lab) flatbed <b>scanners</b> can reach a dynamic range of 3.7, and Dmax around 4.0d. Dedicated film scanners [...] have a dynamic range between 3.0d-4.0d. [...] Office document scanners can have a dynamic range of less than 2.0d. Drum scanners have a dynamic range of 3.6-4.5.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{scientific}} {{conference is}} a type of event for which the structured program is generally known in advance. The Semantic Web community has setup a so-called Semantic Web dog food server that exposes structured data about the detailed program of more and more conferences and their sub-events (e. g. sessions). Conferences are also events that trigger a tremendous activity on social media. Participants tweet or post longer status messages, engage in discussion with comments, share slides and other media captured during the conference. This information is spread over multiple platforms forcing the user to monitor many different channels {{at the same time to}} fully benefit of the event.

40|$|This is {{the first}} {{reporting}} in Materials Science and Engineering at UNSW of accurate quantitative digital micro-structural analyses of 95 - 100 mm diameter concrete cores utilising 64 -bit image acquisition, and 64 -bit image analysis software. The results of these newly developed, highly accurate automated quantitative analysis techniques to forensically compare micro-structural variations between hardened concrete core samples are presented. Quantitative micro-structural digital analysis of large image data files (> 3 GB), have only recently been able to be studied outside the proprietary concrete laboratories {{with the release of}} 64 -bit Image J, 64 -bit Windows 7 operating system and 64 -bit Office 2010. This thesis will demonstrate that only three simple procedures need to be followed to attain accurate quantitative digital analysis of large hardened concrete micro-structures: 1. The samples must be prepared by slow and careful fine diamond lapping with surface cooling to prevent any underlying damage to concrete micro-structure from overheating, thus preventing pull-outs of fine aggregate and sand particles within the fine cement paste matrix. This also ensures that accurately sized sharp pore perimeters remain and very fine air voids and hairline shrinkage micro-cracks are revealed. 2. The digital image needs to be obtained by a highly accurate white cold cathode fluorescent lamp IR LED light sourced digital scanner, such as a flat bed Epson Perfection V 700 <b>Photo</b> <b>scanner</b> with true optical resolution of at least 6400 ppi x 6400 ppi (~ 4 &# 956; 2). It will be preferable in the near future to use a much higher resolution, as for example 50800 ppi x 50800 ppi (0. 5 &# 956; 2), comparable to the best current proprietary <b>photo</b> <b>scanners</b> and saved in uncompressed TIFF file in 128 -bit software, as soon as 128 -bit Windows 8 becomes available. 3. All digital image files must not be altered or enhanced in any way. Any enhancement of the digital image file changes forever its ability to be used for accurate quantitative digital analysis. All image analysis software calculations thereafter can only be then roughly qualitative. Hundreds of digital image files ranging from 72 ppi to 6400 ppi in 32 -bit and 64 -bit digital analysis software were required {{to be able to say}} that the calibrated, guaranteed, and highly accurate quantitative analyses of complex microstructures from a variety of hardened concrete mixes were correct. The 64 -bit Image Analysis and Processing Software enabled me to develop automated, highly accurate, forensic comparative methods to study the macro-structures and micro-structures of commercial sized concrete core samples...|$|R
40|$|Whether in a {{classroom}} setting or at a local community meeting, opportunities for providing descriptive and positive information about our professions to an audience unfamiliar with acoustics, noise control or hearing conservation often call for alternatives to technical demonstrations that illustrate principles of acoustics or noise control. More importantly, successful outreach presentations must convey images of our day-to-day activities and the challenges we address, {{many of which are}} non-technical. One successful approach to career outreach presentations makes use of a collection of <b>photo</b> <b>slides</b> featuring the speaker, his colleagues, customers and workplaces to vividly illustrate the specific job tasks, people and environment of the speaker's job or career. Against this fluid and multi-dimensional visual backdrop, an accompanying script addresses the main theme. A comprehensive <b>photo</b> <b>slide</b> collection may be established gradually, often by making use of and adding to technical and personal slides already in the speaker's possession. Slide collections are portable, easily and quickly reconfigured for back-to-back or spontaneous engagements, and they are well suited to speaking opportunities where technical presentations or demonstrations are not practical or appropriate. A carefully chosen sequence of <b>photo</b> <b>slides</b> minimizes the need for speaker's notes, as each photo itself provides a visual prompt. Although <b>photo</b> <b>slide</b> presentations are appropriate to a variety of outreach and professional settings, the specific illustrative and explanatory material presented here illustrates their application in career education outreach activities, using industrial hearing conservation as an example...|$|R

The roots of these five plants were also scanned with a Perfection 2480 <b>Photo</b> <b>Scanner</b> (Epson Deutschland Ltd., Meersbuch, Germany) against a black background. The resulting images (300 [*]×[*] 300 dpi) were captured by means of HarFA (Harmonic and Fractal image Analyzer) software ([URL] (Zmeškal et al. 2001), which was previously shown to be suitable for the evaluation of images from biological experiments (Tománková et al. 2006) and neuroscience (Wu et al. 2010). The scanned images were saved as bitmaps and subjected to 2 D Wavelet Analysis. Overall results of biological activity were assessed by means of R Environment for Statistical Computing software ([URL] (R Development Core Team 2012). The root growth increments for the particular 15 samples were statistically compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Post-hoc multiple comparisons were conducted using Tukey’s HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) test. The assumptions were evaluated using Levene’s test and the Shapiro-Wilk’s test. Slight discrepancies vis-à-vis the normality assumptions were disregarded, as they were considered to have minimal impact on the results.|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 15 - 17, 1969 / Sheraton Park Hotel, Washington, D. C. The {{process of}} {{converting}} nonlinear analog signals to linear digital signals {{is a type}} of companding. This process of companding consists of compressing or expanding the dynamic range at the transmitter and restoring the original levels at the receiver. In telephony it is used to account for differences in speakers' voices. A loud voice will not overdrive the channel, yet a soft voice can be heard. In image transmission and processing, companding is even more important {{because of the nature of}} image forming. Both natural and photographic image formation are multiplicative processes. In a natural scene, the illumination and reflectance of objects are combined by multiplication to form observable brightness. Since this combining is a nonlinear process, it is important to transform the output to a linear signal at the earliest possible point in the transmission. If linearizing is not done, noise will affect the dark portion of the picture much more than the bright areas. Companding can be accomplished in many ways either by analog or digital method. The most common analog method is the use of log amplifiers with nonlinear amplitude gain. The most common digital technique is nonlinear encoding which performs the companding while the analog signal is being converted to digits. This companding process, when used on the output of a <b>photo</b> <b>scanner,</b> can be used to improve the transmission and reconstruction of digital pictures...|$|R
