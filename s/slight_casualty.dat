5000|$|In 1999, when Great Britain had {{the safest}} roads in Europe apart from Sweden, the {{government}} {{set a new}} national casualty reduction target, to be met by the year 2010. The target for 2010, compared to the average for the years 1994 to 1998, was a reduction of 40% {{in the number of}} people Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) casualties, a reduction of 50% the number of children KSI casualties and a reduction of 10% in the rate of people slightly injured per 100 million vehicle kilometres.

40|$|The UK Government {{is seeking}} to {{substantially}} {{reduce the number of}} road traffic accidents (RTAs) leading to injury or loss of life. Specifically, relative to the average figures for 1994  98, the Government would like to meet the following road casualty reduction targets by 2010 :  a 40 % {{reduction in the number of}} people killed or seriously injured in road accidents;  a 50 % reduction in the number of children killed or seriously injured in road accidents;  a 10 % reduction in the <b>slight</b> <b>casualty</b> rate, expressed as the number of people slightly injured per 100 vehicle kilometres. To develop effective strategies for reducing RTAs, the cause of accidents must be understood. With this in mind, the On the Spot (OTS) project was commissioned to gather in-depth information at the scene of accidents. Since the data collection began in 2000, more than 3, 000 accidents have been recorded, and more than 2, 000 were available when this study was started in November 2005. This report details the technical strategy and findings of the analysis undertaken, and provides recommendations on how these findings can be used to inform the formation of road safety policy...|$|E
40|$|Although Great Britain {{has a good}} {{road safety}} {{performance}} {{the number of people}} killed and injured on our roads remains unacceptably high. In 2001 the number of people killed was 3, 450, seriously injured 37, 110 and total casualties 313, 309. In April 2000 our Road Safety Strategy was published to support the new casualty reduction targets. These are {{to reduce the number of}} people killed and seriously injured by 40 % by the year 2010, and for children 50 %. In addition we aim for a 10 % reduction in the <b>slight</b> <b>casualty</b> rate expressed as the number of people injured per 100 million vehicle kilometres. These targets take the averages for the five years 1994 - 98 as the baseline. The Road Safety Strategy includes all forms of intervention based on engineering, education and enforcement and recognises that there are many different factors that lead to traffic collisions and casualties. This paper is concerned with speeding and intervention by speed limit enforcement using cameras. In Great Britain we have developed a new funding system to ensure that this activity is fully funded and more effective in dealing with the serious problem of speeding on our roads. The paper explains how it was piloted and is now being rolled out to all areas of Great Britain...|$|E

30|$|As data {{regarding}} the local severity split {{of the casualties}} were not available, the default accident rates from the parameter file were used. As expected, the number of casualties saved increases in a linear fashion {{with the number of}} businesses involved in the scheme; however, the gradient of each line varies (Fig. 12). The number of fatal casualties rises most slowly; it cannot be seen from the graph, however, with 10 businesses involved, there are no savings in fatal casualties, and with 330 businesses, there are 17.5 fatalities prevented. This is in contrast to the ‘slight casualties’ section, which rises from 86.2 to 2146.2. This is clearly because <b>slight</b> <b>casualties</b> are most common in traffic collisions, indeed this {{can be seen from the}} fact that the number of <b>slight</b> <b>casualties</b> prevented is greater than the total number of accidents. This is presumably due to the fact that there is often more than one person in a vehicle, and that usually two vehicles are involved in a collision.|$|R

The human cost of non-fatal accidents using the above analyses is compared with the results of a conventional text based method, and also is compared with the results of the previous studies done in other countries...|$|R

Multilevel negative binomial regression models were used to identify combinations of risk factors that predicted variations in mortality and morbidity. Statistically significant explanatory variables were the expected number of casualties derived from the size and age structure of the resident population, road length and traffic counts in the district, the percentage of roads classed as minor, average cars per capita, material deprivation, the percentage of roads through urban areas and the average curvature of roads.

Taking account of other risk factors, measures of average road curvature in wards were negatively associated with crash numbers, especially for fatal crashes. The strongest associations were with the cumulative angle turned per km. The results add to evidence suggesting that road casualty risk effects vary with geographical scale. Although individual road bends might be hazardous, frequent bends have a protective effect over a few kilometres of road...|$|R

This comparison showed that the pedestrian protection of the new car fleet in Australia is inferior {{to that of the}} new car fleet in Europe, and the difference is associated with the introduction of the first phase requirements of the Directive. The benefits to Australia of an ADR on pedestrian protection were calculated, based on benefit calculations that were estimated for a second phase of European regulation due in 2011.

60|$|The {{operations}} {{at this time}} were entirely directed to the erection of the beacon, in which every man felt an equal interest, as at this critical period the <b>slightest</b> <b>casualty</b> {{to any of the}} boats at the rock might have been fatal to himself individually, while it was perhaps peculiar to the writer more immediately to feel {{for the safety of the}} whole. Each log or upright beam of the beacon was to be fixed to the rock by two strong and massive bats or stanchions of iron. These bats, for the fixture of the principal and diagonal beams and bracing chains, required fifty-four holes, each measuring two inches in diameter and eighteen inches in depth. There had already been so considerable a progress made in boring and excavating the holes that the writer's hopes of getting the beacon erected this year began to be more and more confirmed, although it was now advancing towards what was considered the latter end of the proper working season at the Bell Rock. The foreman joiner, Mr. Francis Watt, was accordingly appointed to attend at the rock to-day, when the necessary levels were taken for the step or seat of each particular beam of the beacon, that they might be cut to their respective lengths, to suit the inequalities of the rock; several of the stanchions were also tried into their places, and other necessary observations made, to prevent mistakes on the application of the apparatus, and to facilitate the operations when the beams came to be set up, which would require to be done in the course of a single tide.|$|R

50|$|Italy, {{first as}} an Axis member {{and later as}} a German-occupied country, was heavily bombed by Allied forces for all the {{duration}} of the war.In Northern Italy, after small-scale bombings which mainly targeted factories, only causing little damage and casualties, RAF Bomber Command launched a first large-scale area bombing campaign on Milan, Turin and Genoa (the so-called ‘industrial triangle’) during the autumn of 1942. All three cities suffered heavy damage and hundreds on civilian casualties, although the effects were less disastrous than those suffered by German cities, mainly because Italian cities had centers made of brick and stone buildings, while German cities had centers made of wooden buildings. Milan and Turin were bombed again in February 1943; the heaviest raids were carried out in July (295 bombers dropped 763 tons of bombs on Turin, killing 792 people) and August (all three cities were bombed and a total of 843 bombers dropped 2,268 tons of bombs over Milan, causing about 900 casualties). These attacks caused widespread damage and prompted most of the cities’ inhabitants to flee.During 1944 and 1945 Milan, Turin and Genoa were instead bombed by USAAF bombers, which mainly targeted factories and marshalling yards; nonetheless, imprecision in bombings caused further destruction of vast areas. By the end of the war, about 30-40% of the buildings {{in each of the three}} cities were destroyed, and both in Milan and Turin less than half of the city remained undamaged. 2,069 people were killed in Turin and over 2,200 in Milan.The only other city in Italy to be subjected to area bombing was La Spezia, heavily bombed by the Bomber Command during April 1943, with <b>slight</b> <b>casualties</b> but massive damage (45% of the buildings were destroyed or heavily damaged, and just 25-30% remained undamaged).Several other cities in Northern Italy suffered heay damage and casualties due to USAAF bombings, usually aimed at factories and marshalling yards but often inaccurate; among them Bologna (2,481 casualties), Padua (about 2,000 casualties), Rimini (98% of the city was destroyed or damaged), Treviso (1,600 killed in the bombing of 7 April 1944, 80% of the city destroyed or damaged), Trieste (463 casualties on 10 June 1944), Vicenza (317 casualties on 18 November 1944).In Southern Italy, after small-scale bombings by the RAF (more frequent than in the North), USAAF started its bombing campaign in December 1942. The bombings mostly targeted harbour facilities, marshalling yards, factories and airports, but the inaccuracy of the attacks caused extensive destruction and civilian casualties; among the cities hit the hardest were Naples (6,000 casualties), Messina (more than one third of the city was destroyed, and only 30% remained untouched), Reggio Calabria, Foggia (thousands of casualties), Cagliari (416 inhabitants were killed in the bombings of February 1943, 80% of the city was damaged or destroyed), Palermo, Catania and Trapani (70% of the buildings were damaged or destroyed).|$|R
