5|$|As Feodora grew older, various suitors were {{considered}} for marriage. The exiled Prince Peter Karađorđević, thirty-six years her senior, unsuccessfully requested {{her hand in}} marriage. Another potential candidate was her cousin Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In late 1897, Feodora became engaged to Prince Henry XXX of Reuss, and they married the following year, on 24 September 1898 in a Lutheran ceremony at Breslau. The groom was fifteen years older than his bride and a captain in a Brunswick regiment, but not wealthy or particularly high-ranked. Many in the family were <b>shocked</b> <b>at</b> the marriage, but the Dowager Empress was at least pleased that her granddaughter seemed happy with the match.|$|E
5|$|Born in Moss Side, Manchester to {{politically}} active parents, Pankhurst was introduced {{at the age}} of 14 to the women's suffrage movement. On 18 December 1879, she married Richard Pankhurst, a barrister 24 years older than her, known for supporting women's rights to vote; they had five children over the next ten years. He supported her activities outside the home, and she founded and became involved with the Women's Franchise League, which advocated suffrage for both married and unmarried women. When that organisation broke apart, she tried to join the left-leaning Independent Labour Party through her friendship with socialist Keir Hardie but was initially refused membership by the local branch on account of her gender. While working as a Poor Law Guardian, she was <b>shocked</b> <b>at</b> the harsh conditions she encountered in Manchester's workhouses.|$|E

40|$|A coronal mass {{ejection}} (CME) {{associated with}} a type II burst and originating close {{to the center of}} the solar disk typically results in a <b>shock</b> <b>at</b> Earth in 2 - 3 days and hence can be used to predict <b>shock</b> arrival <b>at</b> Earth. However, a significant fraction (about 28 %) of such CMEs producing type II bursts were not associated with <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> Earth. We examined a set of 21 type II bursts observed by the Wind/WAVES experiment at decameter-hectometric (DH) wavelengths that had CME sources very close to the disk center (within a central meridian distance of 30 degrees), but did not have a <b>shock</b> <b>at</b> Earth. We find that the near-Sun speeds of these CMEs average to ~ 644 km/s, only slightly higher than the average speed of CMEs associated with radio-quiet shocks. However, the fraction of halo CMEs is only ~ 30 %, compared to 54 % for the radio-quiet shocks and 91 % for all radio-loud shocks. We conclude that the disk-center radio-loud CMEs with no <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> 1 AU are generally of lower energy and they drive shocks only close to the Sun and dissipate before arriving at Earth. There is also evidence for other possible processes that lead to the lack of <b>shock</b> <b>at</b> 1 AU: (i) overtaking CME shocks merge and one observes a single <b>shock</b> <b>at</b> Earth, and (ii) deflection by nearby coronal holes can push the shocks away from the Sun-Earth line, such that Earth misses these shocks. The probability of observing a <b>shock</b> <b>at</b> 1 AU increases rapidly above 60 % when the CME speed exceeds 1000 km/s and when the type II bursts 2 propagate to frequencies below 1 MHz...|$|R
40|$|Size {{matters in}} banking. In this paper, we explore whether <b>shocks</b> {{originating}} <b>at</b> large banks affect {{the probability of}} distress of smaller banks and thus {{the stability of the}} banking system. Our analysis proceeds in two steps. In a first step, we follow Gabaix (2008 a) and construct a measure of idiosyncratic <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> large banks, the so-called Banking Granular Residual. This measure documents the importance of size effects for the German banking system. In a second step, we incorporate this measure of idiosyncratic <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> large banks into an integrated stress-testing model for the German banking system following De Graeve et al. (2007). We find that positive <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> large banks reduce the probability of distress of small banks.

A papal legate, Philip, bishop of Fermo, came to Hungary to help Ladislaus {{consolidate}} his authority, but the prelate was <b>shocked</b> <b>at</b> {{the presence of}} thousands of pagan Cumans in Hungary. Ladislaus promised that he would force them to adopt a Christian lifestyle, but they refused to obey the legate's demands. Ladislaus decided to support the Cumans, for which Philip of Fermo excommunicated him. The Cumans imprisoned the legate, and the legate's partisans captured Ladislaus. In early 1280, Ladislaus agreed to persuade the Cumans {{to submit to the}} legate, but many Cumans preferred to leave Hungary.|$|E
5|$|In September 1928 Britten went as a boarder to Gresham's School, in Holt, Norfolk.

He remained there for two years and in 1930, he won a composition scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London; his examiners were the composers John Ireland and Ralph Vaughan Williams and the college's harmony and counterpoint teacher, S P Waddington.|$|E
5|$|Abu Qatada Ansari, a {{companion}} of Muhammad, who accompanied Khalid from Medina was so <b>shocked</b> <b>at</b> Malik's murder by Khalid that he immediately returned to Medina, and told Abu Bakr that {{he refused to}} serve under a commander who had killed a Muslim. The death of Malik and Khalid's taking of his wife Layla created controversy. Some officers of his army—including Abu Qatadah—believed that Khalid killed Malik to take his wife. After the pressure exerted by Umar—Khalid's cousin and one of Caliph Abu Bakr's main advisors—Abu Bakr called Khalid back to Medina to explain himself. Although Khalid had declared Malik an apostate, in Medina, ‘Umar told Khâlid: “You enemy of Allâh! You killed a Muslim man and then leap upon his wife. By Allâh, I will stone you".

5|$|His exile over, Vladimir {{was banned}} from Saint Petersburg, instead {{settling}} in Pskov, {{a small town}} two hours' train ride from the capital, in February 1900. His wife, who had not served the entirety of her sentence, remained in exile in Ufa, where she fell ill. Intent on founding a newspaper, Vladimir and Struve raised money for the publication of Iskra (The Spark), a new organ of the Russian Marxist movement, now calling itself the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). After visiting his wife, on 29 July 1900, Vladimir left Russia for Western Europe. In Switzerland and Germany, he met with Axelrod, Plekhanov and Potresov, and lectured on the Russian situation. On 24 August 1900, a conference of Russian Marxists {{was held in the}} Swiss town of Corsier to discuss Iskra, but both Vladimir and Potresov were <b>shocked</b> <b>at</b> Plekhanov's controlling nature and antisemitism. It was agreed that the paper would be produced in Munich, where Vladimir moved in September 1900. The first issue was printed on Christmas Eve, and contained an article written by Vladimir decrying European intervention in the Boxer Rebellion. A second RSDLP publication, Zarya, appeared in March 1901, and would run for four issues, but Iskra was far more successful, being smuggled into Russia illegally, becoming the most successful Russian underground publication for 50 years. It contained contributions from such figures as the Polish Rosa Luxemburg, the Czech-German Karl Kautsky, and a young Ukrainian Marxist, Leon Trotsky, who became a regular contributor from the autumn of 1902.|$|E
5|$|Khal Drogo, delirious from an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} chest wound inflicted by Mago, falls from his saddle, {{a sign of weakness}} among the Dothraki. Daenerys takes Drogo into her tent and sends for Mirri Maz Duur to help him. However, Ser Jorah Mormont advises Daenerys that they should leave now because the Dothraki only respect the physically strong. He explains that, if Drogo dies, Qotho and the other bloodriders will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill her and her unborn child to prevent Drogo's son from growing up to be a rival. Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband, even when Mirri tells Daenerys that she cannot save him and instead advises giving Drogo a quick, clean death. In desperation, Daenerys encourages Mirri to use blood magic despite Mirri's warning about the consequences of such a spell, that only death can pay for life. Mirri brings Drogo's horse into the tent, slits its throat, orders everyone to leave, and warns that none must enter during the spell. Qotho, <b>shocked</b> <b>at</b> what Daenerys has done, tries to stop the spell, but Mormont kills him to prevent interference. Daenerys then goes into premature labor, but none of the Dothraki midwives help her, owing to their belief that she is cursed. In desperation, Mormont carries Daenerys into Drogo's tent to seek Mirri's help.|$|E
5|$|The strike {{involved}} {{three of}} the province's four major copper mines: the mines at Mufulira, Nkana and Roan Antelope. On the morning of 21 May 1935, police at Mulfulira announced that taxes were raised from 12 to 15 shillings a year. The strike was spontaneous, with morning-shift miners refusing to go underground. It was led by three Zambians from the Northern Province: William Sankata, Ngostino Mwamba and James Mutali at the Mufulira mine. The other African miners refused to report to work, shouted slogans against the authorities and threw stones at them and non-supportive Africans. At the other two mines, the strike was less spontaneous than at Mufulira (where the tax increase was received with disbelief) and police arrested leaders as a precautionary measure. News of the Mufulira strike spread {{to the other two}} mines with the inflow of miners from Mufulira. Beni dancers, who developed the dance form during the colonial era and who mimicked military and colonial administration with music and aesthetic expression, were instrumental in structured communication during the strike. African workers went on strike in Nkana on 27 May, but it failed and ended the following day due to poor leadership. The strike at Roan Antelope, where some tribal leaders participated, turned violent. On 29 May, a large crowd gathered around the compound containing police, officials, clerks and elders; protesters began throwing stones and shouting slogans. The police panicked and fired, leading to the deaths of six protesters and injuring 17 others. <b>Shocked</b> <b>at</b> the shootout, the strikers called off the strike. According to a UNESCO International Scientific Committee report, organized demonstrations were held on 22 May at the Mulfra mine and spread to Nkana on 26 May and the Luansha mines on 28 May. Casualties were reported as 28 killed or injured, with an unspecified number of arrests.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that treatment strategy plays a critical role in ensuring maximum stone fragmentation during shockwave lithotripsy (SWL). We aimed to develop an optimal treatment strategy in SWL to produce maximum stone fragmentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four treatment strategies were evaluated using an in-vitro experimental setup that mimics stone fragmentation in the renal pelvis. Spherical stone phantoms were exposed to 2100 shocks using the Siemens Modularis (electromagnetic) lithotripter. The treatment strategies included increasing output voltage with 100 <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> 12. 3 kV, 400 <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> 14. 8 kV, and 1600 <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> 15. 8 kV, and decreasing output voltage with 1600 <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> 15. 8 kV, 400 <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> 14. 8 kV, and 100 <b>shocks</b> <b>at</b> 12. 3 kV. Both increasing and decreasing voltages models were run at a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 1 and 2 Hz. Fragmentation efficiency was determined using a sequential sieving method to isolate fragments less than 2 mm. A fiberoptic probe hydrophone was used to characterize the pressure waveforms at different output voltage and frequency settings. In addition, a high-speed camera was used to assess cavitation activity in the lithotripter field that was produced by different treatment strategies. RESULTS: The increasing output voltage strategy at 1 Hz PRF produced the best stone fragmentation efficiency. This result was significantly better than the decreasing voltage strategy at 1 Hz PFR (85. 8 % vs 80. 8 %, P= 0. 017) and over the same strategy at 2 Hz PRF (85. 8 % vs 79. 59 %, P= 0. 0078). CONCLUSIONS: A pretreatment dose of 100 low-voltage output shockwaves (SWs) at 60 SWs/min before increasing to a higher voltage output produces the best overall stone fragmentation in vitro. These findings could lead to increased fragmentation efficiency in vivo and higher success rates clinically...|$|R
