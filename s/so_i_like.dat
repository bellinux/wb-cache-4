500|$|Following his blues fusion with {{gospel and}} jazz {{influences}} on his earlier Atlantic material, which {{had brought him}} much fame and controversy, Charles sought to experiment with country music. As noted by himself in the liner notes for What'd I Say (1959), Charles {{was influenced by the}} genre in his youth, stating that he [...] "used to play piano in a hillbilly band" [...] and that he believed that he [...] "could do a good job with the right hillbilly song today." [...] At Atlantic, he attempted to incorporate this style and influence with his cover of country singer Hank Snow's [...] "I'm Movin' On". Charles later said about the song, [...] "When I heard Hank Snow sing 'Moving On', I loved it. And the lyrics. Keep in mind, I’m a singer, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> lyrics. Those lyrics are great, so that’s what made me want to do it." [...] The [...] "I'm Movin' On" [...] sessions were his last for Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Channel V Australia, he recalled {{that the two of}} them were able to communicate their thoughts about the tracks they developed, [...] "on an organisational level", thus accelerating the process. Madonna was completely involved in the recording which was a surprise for Solveig, since he had expected the singer not to stay more than an hour or two in the recording studio and then leave. Madonna expressed her thoughts about the composition, including the instrumentation to be used as Solveig added, [...] "at some point she wanted to choose the sound of a snare drum or a synth and that kind of stuff. She was really in the session!" [...] Madonna reciprocated the feelings saying that she liked Solveig's way of working: [...] "He's very organised and methodical in his thinking <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> his work process". The singer also stated that she was able to disapprove something which she did not like without hurting his feelings.|$|E
500|$|Oakley and Weinstein stood down as showrunners after season eight {{because they}} [...] "didn't {{want to break}} [...] " [...] and Mike Scully took over as showrunner in 1997. As showrunner and {{executive}} producer, Scully said his aim was to [...] "not wreck the show", Scully was popular with the staff members, many of whom praised his organization and management skills. Writer Tom Martin said he was [...] "quite possibly the best boss I've ever worked for" [...] and [...] "a great manager of people" [...] while writer Don Payne commented that for Scully [...] "it was really important that we kept decent hours". Scully noted: [...] "I wrote a lot of Lisa's shows. I have five daughters, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> Lisa a lot. I like Homer, too. Homer comes very naturally to me: I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing. A lot of my favorite episodes are the ones when Homer and Lisa are in conflict with each other... They're very human, I think that's their appeal." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1993, David Mirkin hired Scully {{to write}} for The Simpsons, as a {{replacement}} for the departing Conan O'Brien, after reading some of his sample scripts. He began as a writer and producer for the show during its fifth season and wrote the episodes [...] "Lisa's Rival", [...] "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" [...] and [...] "Lisa on Ice" [...] which aired in season six. [...] "Lisa's Rival" [...] was his first episode; he wrote the script, but the original concept had been conceived by O'Brien. Similarly, he wrote the script for [...] "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds", which was based on an idea by Al Jean and Mike Reiss. [...] "Lisa on Ice" [...] was inspired by Scully's love of ice hockey and featured many experiences from his childhood, as was [...] "Marge Be Not Proud" [...] (which he wrote for season seven) which was based [...] "one of the most traumatic moments" [...] of his life, when he was caught shoplifting at age 12. He jokingly told Variety that [...] "It's great to be paid for reliving the horrors of your life." [...] He also wrote [...] "Team Homer" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Date with Density". Scully noted: [...] "I wrote a lot of Lisa's shows. I have five daughters, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> Lisa a lot. I like Homer, too. Homer comes very naturally to me: I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing. A lot of my favorite episodes are the ones when Homer and Lisa are in conflict with each other...

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Tik Tok" [...] was {{directed}} by Syndrome. It was shot in Kesha's old neighborhood and the car featured in the video belongs to her. Kesha explained the experience saying, [...] "the video I'm excited about because I actually got to shoot it in my old neighborhood and the guy driving my gold car {{is a friend of}} mine". The video's party scene was shot in her friend's house, which they refer to as the [...] "drunk tank". The singer said [...] "the last party scene is in this house called the drunk tank, which is one of my friend's houses that we all go party at. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it cause its super-honest and genuine." [...] The video begins with Kesha waking in a bathtub in a home as she stumbles out and begins to look for a toothbrush in the restroom. She makes her way down a staircase looking at the pictures lining the wall. Kesha makes her way to the kitchen and walks in on a family who are having breakfast, startling them. She shrugs and then leaves the home as the family gets up and follows her. When she arrives at the sidewalk, she picks up a gold bicycle lying against a fallen fence and rides off. Kesha meets a group of children and trades the bicycle for their boombox. The video cuts to another scene where she rejects a guy and is picked up by a man portrayed by Simon Rex who drives her in a gold 1978 Trans Am. They are pulled over by the police, who handcuff Kesha. The scene then pans to her singing while standing in the T-top as she dangles the handcuffs hanging from her left arm. The next scene shows Kesha in an empty room filled with glitter. She then attends a party with Rex for the final scene. The video comes to an end with Kesha lying in a different bathtub from the one she woke up in. The official music video has received over 360 million views on YouTube as of July 2017.|$|E

One is “No litter”; anyone caught littering, {{and that includes}} cigarette butts, will not be invited back to hunt on Bradley 3 land. She insists that guests treat her as a friend, not as a business associate, and that they stay in communication: “We have a busy ranch, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to have hunters call {{ahead of time and}} let me know when they’ll be there. All of my hunters are great at communicating when they plan on being out and are always quick to let me know if they see any problems on the ranch.” ...|$|E

2500|$|André St-Pierre is the {{director}} of the episodes. He is best known as the co-director of the Télé-Québec show Les Francs-Tireurs and La Job was his first fiction. Script adaptation was given to Ian Lauzon and Jean-Philippe Granger was made screenwriter. Like the American Office, improv veterans were called to fill the shoes of some of the original actors. The role of the David Brent boss was entrusted to Antoine Vézina, a performer of the reputed Ligue nationale d'improvisation (LNI), a Quebec-born concept of improvisational theatre and international improv team competition (Quebec, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy). Sophie Cadieux, who holds the role corresponding to Dawn Tinsley, has also taken part in the LNI. Paul Ahmarani, playing La Jobs Gareth Keenan, is a great fan of the British series. About the black humor of the show, he comments: [...] "Personally, when I began watching that show, after five minutes, I knew that I had before my eyes something unique, that would literally shatter all that we had seen before". On his character, he sums up that [...] "I'm someone that is very much of a coward, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to take refuge in military fantasies of virility... I really like to say that I spent three years in the army... I'm a bit of a loser, very right-wing, very militarist". Sébastien Huberdeau, the Tim Canterbury equivalent, was seen on international screens in The Barbarian Invasions, winner of the 2004 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E
