5|$|<b>Somatic</b> <b>recombination</b> of immunoglobulins, {{also known}} as V(D)J recombination, {{involves}} the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region. The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces—known as gene segments (subgenes). These segments are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments. V, D and J segments are found in Ig heavy chains, but only V and J segments are found in Ig light chains. Multiple copies of the V, D and J gene segments exist, and are tandemly arranged in the genomes of mammals. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain). As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments {{can be used to}} generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different , and thus different antigen specificities. Interestingly, the rearrangement of several subgenes (i.e. V2 family) for lambda light chain immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells.|$|E

40|$|Because of {{the many}} {{superficial}} similarities between {{the immune system and}} the central nervous system, it has long been speculated that <b>somatic</b> DNA <b>recombination</b> is, like the immune system, involved in brain development and function. To examine whether or not the V(D) J recombination signals of the immune system work in an in vitro neural differentiation model, the P 19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line was transfected with a reporter gene that is designed, when rearranged, to express bacterial beta-galactosidase, which was previously reported to exhibit <b>somatic</b> DNA <b>recombination</b> in the transgenic mouse brain. The cloned cells were then induced into neural cells by retinoic acid treatment. This neural induction treatment resulted in the cloning of a P 19 cell line that showed a high incidence of beta-galactosidase-positive cells. Most of these beta-galactosidase-positive cells were immunocytochemically identified as either neurons, neuroepithelial cells, or astrocytes. The 5 '-end sequences of the beta-galactosidase transcripts expressed in the induced cells were analyzed, and sequences were found that seemed to reflect DNA rearrangement through re-integration of the reporter gene into the host genome. However, the V(D) J recombination signals did not work in the in vitro model. These results suggested that DNA rearrangement activity though integration increased during neural differentiation of P 19 cells. </p...|$|R

The molecular cloning of the TcR/ 3 chain (4, 5), and subsequently the ~ chain (6 - 8), established that these genes are distinct from Ig genes. Based on sequence analysis of cDNAs and germline sequences, it appears that functional TcR genes are formed by <b>somatic</b> <b>recombinations</b> of variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J), and constant (C) gene segments (4 - 8, 9). Chromosomal mapping of these genes indicate that they are found at locations different from those of Ig genes, indicating that these genes are different from those used in the rearrangement of Ig genes (10 - 13). The germline organizations of these TcR and the Ig genes share a basic structure, but definite differences are revealed upon closer examination (14 - 19). Thus, TcR genes have their own set of germline genes as their basis for functional diversity. Estimates of the repertoire of TcR V, gene segments in mouse have been reported (20, 21).

40|$|Both alleles of {{immunoglobulin}} (Ig) heavy-chain joining region (JH) {{genes in}} three Ig-negative Abelson {{murine leukemia virus}} (Ab-MuLV) -transformed cell lines were characterized by DNA cloning and nucleotide sequence determination. These studies unambiguously identified two distinct types of Ig-negative B-lineage cells. The first type of cell (e. g., R 8) is an "immature pre-B cell," and it contains at least one intermediate recombinant structure containing heavy-chain diversity (DH) and JH sequences but no variable region (VH) sequence. This type of cell, which has also been characterized by other investigators, generates mu-positive sublines during subsequent culturing of cells and represents a precursor stage to pre-B cells. The second type of cell (e. g., RAW 253) is an "abortive pre-B cell," in that both JH alleles contain nonfunctional VH-DH-JH structures. The nucleotide sequence determinations in this study demonstrated that these nonfunctional V-D-J structures were generated by nonproductive <b>somatic</b> <b>recombinations,</b> involving either out-of-phase joining events, or the formation of termination codons in the DH coding sequences. The identification of abortive pre-B cells suggests that the recombinational joining of Ig VH, DH, and JH segments is not actively regulated by a putative recombinase to preserve the translational reading frame.

Our aim was to investigate whether information about changes of antioxidative enzyme activities and protein HSP 70 induction are also transmitted in response to stress caused by UV-C irradiation. These stress indicators were investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana plants exposed to UV-C irradiation (6 and 600 J m- 2) and its non-irradiated progeny. The activity of catalase was significantly decreased in the irradiated plants in comparison to the non-irradiated control plants, while the activity of guaiacol peroxidase was increased. The ascorbate peroxidase activity was not significantly changed. In irradiated plants there was an induction of a new HSP 70 protein isoform. In the non- irradiated progeny of irradiated plants, a significant decrease in catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activity was noticed in comparison to plants whose parents were not irradiated. There was no significant change in guaiacol peroxidase activity or induction of HSP 70 isoforms in the progeny.

Despite its economic importance, many basic questions about the biology of the causal fungi, Armillaria spp., are unanswered. For example, Armillaria undergoes matings between diploid and haploid mycelia, which can result in a recombinant diploid without meiosis. Evidence of such <b>somatic</b> <b>recombination</b> in natural populations suggests that this reproductive mode may affect the pathogen's ecology. Investigations of the mechanisms and adaptive consequences of <b>somatic</b> <b>recombination</b> are, however, hampered by the lack of a method to reliably synthesize somatic recombinants. Here we report the first genetic transformation system for the genus Armillaria. We transformed A. mellea with selective markers for use in diploid-haploid matings to reliably synthesize somatic recombinants. This was accomplished with Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying pBGgHg, which carries the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hph). hph was integrated into transformants, as evidenced by serial transfer to selective media, PCR, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and Southern hybridization. Nuclear and mitochondrial markers were developed to genotype synthesized mycelia. In matings between a wild-type diploid and hygromycin-resistant haploids (transgenic), we identified recombinant, hygromycin-resistant diploids and, additionally, hygromycin-resistant triploids, all with the mitochondrial haplotype of the haploid partner. Our approach created no mycelium in which the haploid nucleus was replaced by the diploid nucleus, the typical outcome of diploid-haploid matings in Armillaria. This genetic transformation system, in combination with new markers to track chromosomal and cytoplasmic inheritance in A. mellea, will advance research aimed at characterizing the significance of <b>somatic</b> <b>recombination</b> in the ecology of this important fungus...|$|E

In both cases, the target specificity of recombination reactions seems to be regulated by structural changes of the target chromatin. In fact, many studies support this notion, called the “accessibility model”.
