25|$|As {{a result}} of the rebel capture of the village of Ain al-Fijah in the Barada River valley and its water spring in February 2012, the flow of water to Damascus and nearby towns has been {{sporadically}} <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> by the rebels in retaliation for military operations by government forces in the region for almost 5 years. The conflict escalated on 23 December 2016 when the rebels reportedly polluted the water spring with diesel fuel, although the opposition denies this and claims that the spring was damaged from barrel bombs. As a result, <b>running</b> water was <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> to more than 5.5 million people around Damascus and the government forces launched an offensive on rebel-held villages in the Barada River Valley.|$|R
50|$|Not much {{is known}} about the first battle at Tucson. An Apache force, which Captain Allande {{estimated}} as 350 warriors, approached the Spanish post of Fort Tucson itself. The captain formed a command of fifteen men and engaged the enemy. The Spanish lancers defeated the Apaches in a long <b>running</b> battle. Allande <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> and brought back the head of a slain chieftain and carried it on a lance as a trophy. After waving the head at the surviving Apaches they fled the battlefield, abandoning their plunder of stolen livestock. The Spaniards reportedly killed and wounded several Apache men, including a brother of Chief Quilcho. Exact numbers of casualties are unknown.|$|R

In late June 1971 she left the hospital to live with her teacher at the hospital, but {{a month and a half}} later authorities placed her with the family of the scientist heading the research team, where she lived for almost four years. Soon after turning 18, in mid-1975, Genie returned to live with her mother, who after a few months decided she could not adequately care for her. Authorities then moved her in the first of what would become a series of institutions for disabled adults, and the people <b>running</b> it <b>cut</b> her <b>off</b> from almost everyone she knew and subjected her to extreme physical and emotional abuse. As a result, her physical and mental health severely deteriorated, and her newly acquired language and behavioral skills very rapidly regressed.|$|R

40|$|The pure global {{buckling}} and vibration of {{four sides}} simply supported {{as well as}} clamped anisotropic laminates having an arbitrary shape <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> region that is symmetric with respect to mid-plane have been studied by treating the remaining <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions as uniform plates with reduced stiffness. The reduced variation of stiffness of the plate is represented by Fourier series. Computational solutions of the energy principle for the Ritz method in a plate having arbitrary shape of typical <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions under biaxial compressive loads are obtained. Some numerical results for the pure global buckling load prediction due to its reduced flexural stiffness for the circular <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions and elliptical <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions are presented. We find the normalized pure global buckling load ratio decreases as the <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions size increases, and the non-dimensional fundamental frequency value decreases as the <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions size increases.

40|$|Iran is {{a country}} of water {{scarcity}} due to general low precipitation, high evaporation and the temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall. In {{order to determine the}} effects of disruption of irrigation in different growth stages of autumn’s rapeseed cultivars, an experiment was conducted in 2009 - 2010 at Isfahan agriculture research station. A split plot layout within a randomized complete block design 3 replications was used. Main plots were seven levels of <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> irrigation namely, D 1 = current irrigation or irrigation after 80 millimeter vaporize from class A basin to physiological maturity, D 2 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> irrigation from stem elongation phase and then on, D 3 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the irrigation from flowering and then on, D 4 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the irrigation from pod formation phase and then on, D 5 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the irrigation in stem and flowering phase, D 6 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the irrigation in stem and pod phase, D 7 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the irrigation in flower and pod formation, and sub plots were two rapeseed cultivars, namely, Zarfam and Okapi. With increasing the number of irrigation, rapeseed yield will increase, but if the water lacks occurred, it is better not to <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> irrigation in flower and stem phase, in order to get acceptable seed and oil yield. Zarfam had the highest oil and seed yield in withheld irrigation conditions and also have the best adaptation in water deficit conditions. </p...|$|R
