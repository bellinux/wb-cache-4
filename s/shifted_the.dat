50|$|ALU shift {{operations}} cause operand A (or B) {{to shift}} {{left or right}} (depending on the opcode) and <b>the</b> <b>shifted</b> operand appears at Y. Simple ALUs typically can <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> operand by only one bit position, whereas more complex ALUs employ barrel shifters {{that allow them to}} <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> operand by an arbitrary number of bits in one operation. In all single-bit <b>shift</b> operations, <b>the</b> bit <b>shifted</b> out of <b>the</b> operand appears on carry-out; the value of <b>the</b> bit <b>shifted</b> into <b>the</b> operand depends on <b>the</b> type of <b>shift.</b>|$|R

5|$|Between 1970-2004, inland {{flooding}} from tropical cyclones {{caused a}} majority of the fatalities in the United States. This statistic changed in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina's impact alone <b>shifted</b> <b>the</b> most deadly aspect of tropical cyclones back to storm surge, which has historically been the most deadly aspect of strong tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{changes in}} {{political}} leadership {{on both sides}} <b>shifted</b> <b>the</b> dynamic of the Cold War. Dwight D. Eisenhower was inaugurated president that January. During the last 18months of the Truman administration, the American defense budget had quadrupled, and Eisenhower moved to reduce military spending by a third while continuing to fight the Cold War effectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1986–87, a {{cogeneration}} {{facility was}} added to the central heating plant to generate electricity from the plant's waste heat. A Cornell Combined Heat & Power Project, which was completed in December 2009, <b>shifted</b> <b>the</b> central heating plant from using coal to natural gas and enable the plant to generate all of the campus's non-peak electric requirements.|$|E
50|$|The Nametkin {{rearrangement}} is <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> of a methyl {{group in}} this scheme {{and called the}} 'Nametkin' step. <b>The</b> <b>shift</b> of <b>the</b> ring bond is actually a standard Wagner-Meerwein <b>shift.</b> <b>The</b> reaction can in fact {{be used to make}} the terpene, using chlorocamphene.|$|R

50|$|It is {{believed}} that a receptor molecule exists in a conformational equilibrium between active and inactive states. The binding of FSH to <b>the</b> receptor <b>shifts</b> <b>the</b> equilibrium between active and inactive receptors. FSH and FSH-agonists <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> equilibrium in favor of active states; FSH antagonists <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> equilibrium in favor of inactive states. For a cell to respond to FSH, {{only a small percentage}} (~1%) of receptor sites need to be activated.|$|R
5|$|The initial National Hurricane Center {{forecasts}} {{predicted that}} Katrina would begin turning northward after landfall, eventually {{to hit the}} Florida Panhandle approximately three to four days later. Katrina, however, continued a westerly and west-southwesterly track, which eventually <b>shifted</b> <b>the</b> forecast track westward to New Orleans.|$|E

5|$|After a broad {{review of}} its {{tactical}} force structure, the U.S. Air Force decided {{to adopt a}} low-cost aircraft to supplement the F-4 and F-111. It first focused on the Northrop F-5, which had air-to-air capability. A 1965 cost-effectiveness study <b>shifted</b> <b>the</b> focus from the F-5 to the less expensive LTV A-7D, and a contract was awarded. However, this aircraft doubled in cost with demands for an upgraded engine and new avionics.|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of a ball-and-spring-type detent on <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> sleeve and detents on <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> rail assists <b>the</b> driver in <b>shifting</b> quicker. <b>The</b> detent raises the force required to move <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> lever which prevents excess movement of the shifter by the driver, and reduces the chance of double bump. Tension between <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> sleeve and <b>the</b> <b>shift</b> rail also prevents the sleeve from vibrating while in gear.|$|R

5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Kingdom of Madagascar, the French colonial authorities <b>shifted</b> <b>the</b> location of these tombs thereby disrupting the original cosmological symbolism of their arrangement. When the original tombs were excavated for relocation, the French found the mortal remains of the nobles within had each been wrapped in numerous traditional lambas (woven silk cloths) then set within wooden coffins packed with charcoal. Bodies buried at Ambohimanga were found to have been entombed in the same way.|$|E
5|$|Historian Michael Crawford {{attributes}} {{the disappearance of}} much of Tiberius Gracchus' support to the reduced level of citizen participation due to dispersal far from Rome, and sees his tribunate as marking {{a step in the}} Hellenization of Roman aristocracy. Crawford asserts that Gaius Gracchus' extortion law <b>shifted</b> <b>the</b> balance of power in Rome and that the Gracchi made available a new political armoury which the oligarchy subsequently sought to exploit.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, series one and {{two were}} first aired {{back-to-back}} on ABC1 each Tuesday at 8pm from 3 February 2009 until 7 April when the network <b>shifted</b> <b>the</b> remaining episodes to the later 9:30pm slot until 5 May 2009. Both seasons have since been repeated on the lower-rated ABC2 channel and uploaded to the ABC iView catch-up service. Series three is yet to air in Australia.|$|E
50|$|An {{increase}} in the global interest rate <b>shifts</b> <b>the</b> BoP curve upward and causes capital flows out of the local economy. This depreciates the local currency and boosts net exports, <b>shifting</b> <b>the</b> IS curve to the right. Under less than perfect capital mobility, the depreciated exchange rate <b>shifts</b> <b>the</b> BoP curve somewhat back down.Under perfect capital mobility, the BoP curve is always horizontal {{at the level of}} the world interest rate. When the latter goes up, <b>the</b> BoP curve <b>shifts</b> upward by <b>the</b> same amount, and stays there. The exchange rate changes enough to <b>shift</b> <b>the</b> IS curve to the location where it crosses the new BoP curve at its intersection with the unchanged LM curve; now the domestic interest rate equals the new level of the global interest rate.|$|R

5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for what he}} hoped would be the final attack on The Gully, Vokes <b>shifted</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade to occupy positions formerly belonging to the 1st Brigade. Vokes planned for an attack by The Carleton and York Regiment {{to be the last}} of the frontal assaults against The Gully. Should this attack fail, the 1st Brigade's Seaforth Highlanders and the Royal Canadian Regiment would move through Casa Berardi and outflank German defences, forcing a withdrawal from The Gully.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{the sport}} was pushed forward by American {{mathematician}} John Gill, who contributed several important innovations. Gill's previous athletic pursuit was gymnastics, a sport which had an established scale of difficulty for particular movements and body positions. He applied this idea to bouldering, which <b>shifted</b> <b>the</b> focus from reaching a summit to navigating a specific sequence of holds. Gill developed a closed-ended rating system: B1 problems were {{as difficult as}} the most challenging roped routes of the time, B2 problems were more difficult, and B3 problems were those that had only been completed once.|$|E
5|$|Lombardy {{noted the}} shock that Spassky was in after he resigned:While Fischer dashed for his car, Spassky {{remained}} glued to his seat. A sympathetic Lothar Schmid came over, {{and the two}} <b>shifted</b> <b>the</b> pieces about with Boris demonstrating his careless mistakes. The two were left wondering how Bobby could have squeezed a win from a position which a night of competent analysis by a renowned Soviet team had showed to be a guaranteed draw.|$|E

5|$|Shin Megami Tensei II {{is one of}} {{the notable}} early {{exceptions}} to the series' common setting, as it is set in a science fiction-styled future despite still including fantasy elements. The Last Bible series also shifted to a full fantasy setting. Two more recent notable departures were Strange Journey, which <b>shifted</b> <b>the</b> focus to Antarctica to portray the threat on a global scale, and Shin Megami Tensei IV, which included a medieval-stage society existing separately from a modern-day Tokyo. The Devil Summoner games take the form of modern-day detective stories as opposed to post-apocalyptic settings.|$|E
