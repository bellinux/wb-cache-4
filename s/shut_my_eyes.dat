2500|$|In Campo: Still Entertaining Campese {{reflects}} that, [...] "As chance {{would have}} it, Jonah {{got the ball}} in the opening stages of the second half and ran straight at meâ€¦ I think I <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> but I tackled him. Later in the half he pushed me aside to score a try, but I could at least claim to have cut him down once." [...] Following the Test Campese and Lomu met in the changing rooms and exchanged their jerseys. Lomu gave Campese his number 11 jersey while Campese gave Lomu his number 16 jersey. Campese's 92nd Test marked the last Test he would play in the amateur era.|$|E
2500|$|Many African Americans, called Exodusters, {{escaped the}} Klan and racially discriminatory {{laws in the}} South by moving to large {{northern}} cities, {{as well as to}} places like Kansas where some formed all-black towns to have a greater level of freedom and autonomy. Douglass did not favor this, nor the Back-to-Africa movement, which he thought resembled the American Colonization Society he had fought in his youth. In 1892, at an Indianapolis conference convened by Bishop Henry McNeal Turner, Douglass spoke out against the separatist movements, urging blacks to stick it out. He made similar speeches as early as 1879, and was criticized both by fellow leaders and some audiences, who even booed him for this position. Speaking in Baltimore in 1894, Douglass said, [...] "I hope and trust all will come out right in the end, but the immediate future looks dark and troubled. I cannot <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to the ugly facts before me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the Japanese {{military}} {{offensive against}} the Philippines, President Roosevelt ordered MacArthur {{to evacuate the}} islands. MacArthur reluctantly left, promising to send reinforcements that never came. In his autobiography, MacArthur recalled {{one of his last}} memories on leaving the Philippines was of Bunker:"On the dock I could see the men staring at me. I had lost 25 pounds living on the same diet as the soldiers, and I must have looked gaunt and ghastly standing there in my old war-stained clothes - no bemedaled commander of inspiring presence. ... Through the shattered ruins, my eyes sought 'Topside,' where the deep roar of heavy guns still growled defiance, with their red blasts tearing the growing darkness asunder. Up there, in command, was my classmate, Paul Bunker. Forty years had passed since Bunker had twice been selected by Walter Camp for the All American team. I could <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and see again that blond head racing, tearing, plunging - 210 pounds of irresistible power. I could almost hear Quarterback Charley Daly's shrill voice barking, 'Bunker back.' He and many others up there were old, old friends, bound by ties of deepest friendship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] I said to myself, [...] "I {{have backed}} {{cast-iron}} certainties before. Next time I bet upon a horse I shall make the selection by <b>shutting</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and putting a pin through the card." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't wait to {{talk with}} him any longer, for what would be the use when he was ready to tell me {{anything}} for the sake of <b>shutting</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye,</b> so off I went, putting in my best licks to be on hand when the fun began.|$|R
60|$|MRS. M. No, I {{never saw}} you alone; besides, I {{thought you would}} speak more freely without the knowledge. And, to tell the truth, I did think it {{possible}} that consideration for me might bring my poor Cissy down to us, and that when once under my father's influence, all these mists might clear away. But I do not deserve it. I have been an unfaithful parent, <b>shutting</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> in feeble indulgence, and letting her drift into these quicksands.|$|R
60|$|The {{next moment}} Uncle Willoughby {{had opened the}} drawer. I <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|And then {{footsteps}} sounded outside, and {{the hope}} died away. I <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "When I said I {{would marry}} you, {{you were a}} hero to me. You stood to me for {{everything}} that was noble and brave and wonderful. I had only to <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to conjure up the picture of you as you dived off the rail that morning. Now"--her voice trembled--"if I <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> now,--I can only see {{a man with a}} hideous black face making himself the laughing stock of the ship. How can I marry you, haunted by that picture?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 3 Attend, {{and hear}} my cries, [...] Mind me, Sir! [...] Some comfort now disclose, [...] E'er grief has <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> weeping <b>eyes</b> [...] Which would be nonsense, [...] In death's obscure repose: [...] put in prose.|$|R
60|$|Impossible to {{mistake the}} sound of billiard balls! Impossible to mistake the whir of a ball over the slate! But I was to be excused. Even when I <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> enlightened <b>eyes</b> the sound was marvelously {{like that of a}} fast game.|$|R
60|$|I turned in, as we seamen say, all standing. The {{meaning of}} that is, I did not pull my clothes off--no, not even {{so much as}} my coat: though I did my shoes, for my feet were badly swelled with the deck. There was a little swing-lamp alight in my cabin. I thought, as I looked at it before <b>shutting</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> that I was so tired of darkness, and troubled by darkness, that I {{could have gone to}} sleep best {{in the midst of a}} million of flaming gas-lights. That was the last thought I had before I went off, except the {{prevailing}} thought that I should not be able to get to sleep at all.|$|R
6000|$|LADY WINDERMERE. [Sits on sofa.] Because I, who had <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to life, {{came to the}} brink. And one who had {{separated}} us - ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Master, I saw and heard, not everything, {{because there}} came {{a point at which}} I <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and stopped my ears, but still much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really. That's not {{remarkable}} for you. I'm {{too tired to}} eat. And afraid to <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> They'd never come open. When did we sleep last, Bo?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Playing as a forward, Thomson {{carved out}} {{a career in the}} game despite having only one eye, {{resulting}} from a childhood accident with a firework. When asked how he dealt with a ball coming to him on his blind side, Bob would answer: 'I just <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> other <b>eye</b> and play from memory.' ...|$|R
60|$|The dervish {{took the}} box I had {{extended}} to him, and, bidding me <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> left <b>eye,</b> touched it gently with the ointment. When I opened it again I saw spread out, {{as it were}} before me, treasures of every kind and without number. But as all this time I had been obliged to keep <b>my</b> right <b>eye</b> closed, which was very fatiguing, I begged the dervish to apply the ointment to that eye also.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I sees it all afore {{me every}} time I <b>shuts</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> Lordy, sir, you wouldn't hardly believe how clear it is to me. There's our line from the {{paregoric}} bottle right along to the snuff box. D'ye see? Well, then, the pill box is for Hougoumont on the right--where we was--and Norah's thimble for La Haye Sainte. There it is, all right, sir; and here were our guns, and here behind the reserves and the Belgians. Ach, them Belgians!" [...] He spat furiously into the fire. [...] "Then here's the French, where my pipe lies; and over here, where I put my baccy pouch, was the Proosians a-comin' up on our left flank. Jimini, {{but it was a}} glad sight to see the smoke of their guns!" ...|$|R

60|$|Then I saw the {{man with}} the weapon {{straighten}} himself for the effort. I saw the cold steel gleam on high, and once more I <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "When I said I {{would marry}} you, {{you were a}} hero to me. You stood to me for {{everything}} that was noble and brave and wonderful. I had only to <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to conjure up the picture of you as you dived off the rail that morning.

60|$|The meal being {{finished}} which I {{thought it}} was well to shorten lest he should eat too much who was so weak, again he lifted up his eyes as though in gratitude, and {{as a sign of}} thankfulness, or so I suppose, knelt before me, took my hand, and pressed it against his forehead, thereby, although I did not know it at the time, vowing himself to my service. Then seeing how weary he was I conducted him back to the chamber and pointed out the bed to him, <b>shutting</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to show that he should sleep there. But this he would not do until he had dragged the bedding on to the floor, from which I gathered that his people, whoever they might be, had the habit of sleeping on the ground.|$|R
60|$|The shower was now over, and {{a rainbow}} above the eastern woods promised a fair evening; so I took my departure. When I had got without I {{asked for a}} drink, {{hoping to get a}} sight of the well bottom, to {{complete}} my survey of the premises; but there, alas! are shallows and quicksands, and rope broken withal, and bucket irrecoverable. Meanwhile the right culinary vessel was selected, water was seemingly distilled, and after consultation and long delay passed out to the thirsty one--not yet suffered to cool, not yet to settle. Such gruel sustains life here, I thought; so, <b>shutting</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> and excluding the motes by a skilfully directed undercurrent, I drank to genuine hospitality the heartiest draught I could. I am not squeamish in such cases when manners are concerned.|$|R
60|$|As soon as I {{thought the}} {{groceries}} on the wharf {{would be open}} I left the ship and went to make my breakfast of another glass of water. But this made me very qualmish; and soon I felt sick as death; my head was dizzy; and I went staggering along the walk, almost blind. At last I dropt on a heap of chain-cable, and <b>shutting</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> hard, did <b>my</b> best to rally myself, in which I succeeded, at last, enough {{to get up and}} walk off. Then I thought that I had done wrong in not returning to my friend's house the day before; and would have walked there now, as it was, only it was at least three miles up town; too far for me to walk in such a state, and I had no sixpence to ride in an omnibus.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and thought. Again the flashes {{seemed to}} stand out clear and distinct. But no detail supervened--no face came back to me. I felt it was useless.|$|E
6000|$|At night I go {{on board}} and say [...] Good-night to all my friends on shore; [...] I <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and sail away [...] And see and hear no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--because I {{have been}} unable to <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> to his mode of living. I was to go on paying his debts, and taking no other notice {{whatsoever}} of his conduct!" ...|$|E
60|$|Emp. Oh, Aureng-Zebe! thy virtues shine too bright, They flash too fierce: I, {{like the}} bird of night, <b>Shut</b> <b>my</b> dull <b>eyes,</b> and sicken at the sight. Thou hast {{deserved}} more love than I can show; But 'tis thy fate to give, and mine to owe. Thou seest me much distempered in my mind; Pulled back, and then pushed forward to be kind. Virtue, and--fain I would my silence break, But {{have not yet}} the confidence to speak. Leave me, and to thy needful rest repair.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} very glad to think of nothing," [...] she said at last; [...] "not to think at all; only to <b>shut</b> both <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and give myself up. But I can't. I'm cold, I'm old, I'm a coward; I never {{supposed}} I should marry again, {{and it seems to}} me very strange I should ever have listened to you. When I used to think, as a girl, of what I should do if I were to marry freely, by my own choice, I thought of a very different man from you." ...|$|R
60|$|In another hour, when I {{should have}} been drawing near Thrums, I found myself in a wood, and here I think my {{distress}} was greatest; nor is this to be marvelled at, for instead of being near Thrums, I {{was listening to the}} monotonous roar of the sea. I was too spent to reason, but I knew that I must have travelled direct east, and must be close to the German Ocean. I remember putting my back against a tree and <b>shutting</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> and listening to the lash of the waves against the beach, and hearing the faint toll of a bell, and wondering listlessly on what lighthouse it was ringing. Doubtless I would have lain down to sleep forever had I not heard another sound near at hand. It was the knock of a hammer on wood, and might have been a fisherman mending his boat. The instinct of self-preservation carried me to it, and presently I was at a little house. A man was standing in the rain, hammering new hinges to the door; and though I did not recognize him, I saw with bewilderment that the woman at his side was Nanny.|$|R
6000|$|At night, I go {{on board}} and say [...] Good night to all my friends on shore; [...] I <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and sail away [...] And see and hear no more.|$|E

60|$|Haven't I? I suppose I must <b>shut</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and say nothing. You're in {{love with}} her. D'you think I've not seen it in these months? That's {{why you want to}} leave me.|$|E
60|$|In {{the window}} is fixed a deep box full of soil, where are {{springing}} up my scarlet runners, nasturtiums, and convolvuluses, although they were disturbed {{a few days ago}} by the revolutionary insertion among them of a great ivy root with trailing branches so long and wide that the top tendrils are fastened to Henrietta's window of the higher storey, while the lower ones cover all my panes. It is Mr. Kenyon's gift. He makes the like to flourish out of mere flowerpots, and embower his balconies and windows, and why shouldn't this flourish with me? But certainly--there is no <b>shutting</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> {{to the fact that it}} does droop a little. Papa prophesies hard things against it every morning, 'Why, Ba, it looks worse and worse,' and everybody preaches despondency. I, however, persist in being sanguine, looking out for new shoots, and making a sure pleasure in the meanwhile by listening to the sound of the leaves against the pane, as the wind lifts them and lets them fall. Well, what do you think of my ivy? Ask Mr. Martin, if he isn't jealous already.|$|R
60|$|The {{road for}} the most part winds by the brink of precipices,--walled in with masonry of small stones, where Nature has not shored it up with vast monoliths,--and is paved with limestone. It is, of course, merely a mule-path, and it was curious to see, and thrilling to experience, how the mules, vain of the safety of their foothold, kept as near the border of the precipices as possible. For my own part, I {{abandoned}} to my beast the entire responsibility involved by this line of conduct; let the halter hang loose upon his neck, and gave him no aid except such slight service as was occasionally to be rendered by <b>shutting</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and holding <b>my</b> breath. The mule of the fairer traveller behind me was not only ambitious of peril like my own, but was envious of my beast's captaincy, and continually tried to pass him {{on the outside of the}} path, to the great dismay of the gentle rider; while half-suppressed wails of terror from the second lady in the train gave evidence of equal vanity and daring in her mule. Count Giovanni strode stolidly before, the Cimbrian came behind, and we had little coherent conversation until we stopped under a spreading haw-tree, half-way up the mountain, to breathe our adventurous beasts.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I can {{penetrate}} {{the secret of}} his fancy for going abroad. That wild idea of putting {{the mountains and the}} seas between Armadale and himself is still in his mind. As if either he or I could escape doing what we are fated to do--supposing we really are fated--by putting a few hundred or a few thousand miles between Armadale and ourselves! What strange absurdity and inconsistency! And yet how I like him for being absurd and inconsistent; for don't I see plainly that I am at the bottom of it all? Who leads this clever man astray in spite of himself? Who makes him too blind to see the contradiction in his own conduct, which he would see plainly in the conduct of another person? How interested I do feel in him! How dangerously near I am to <b>shutting</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> on the past, and letting myself love him! Was Eve fonder of Adam than ever, I wonder, after she had coaxed him into eating the apple? I should have quite doted on him if I had been in her place. (Memorandum: To write Midwinter a charming little letter on my side, with a kiss in it; and as time is allowed him before he sends in his answer, to ask for time, too, before I tell him whether I will or will not go abroad.)" ...|$|R
