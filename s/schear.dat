500|$|Semonides 7 is {{generally}} considered to have been written for performance in a symposium: Robin Osborne, for example, suggests that each description {{of a different kind}} of woman might be sung to a different guest. [...] However, the treatment of women – as wives, rather than erotic or mythological figures – is significantly different from other sympotic poetry. [...] Leslie <b>Schear</b> argues that the poem, with its focus on wives, is related to marriage; she suggests that it was intended as a poem to be performed at a wedding feast, initiating the new groom into the ranks of married men.|$|E
500|$|The {{second part}} of the poem {{consists}} of a complaint about the evils of women in general. [...] The poem ends with a mythical example illustrating this point, after which the poem breaks off. [...] It is not certain whether the poem originally ended here: Lloyd-Jones thinks that the ending as it stands is too abrupt, and suggests {{that there may have been}} a number of other mythical examples following the one which is preserved; Leslie <b>Schear</b> disagrees, arguing that it is difficult to think of a mythical example from Greek mythology of a wife's treachery which can top that of Helen of Troy. [...] The fact that this general condemnation of women follows so closely on from the praise of the bee-woman at the end of the first part of the poem is perhaps intended to suggest that though such a woman would be the ideal wife, she is a mirage; no real wives live up to the ideal bee-woman.|$|E
