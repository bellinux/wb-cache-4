5|$|US219 passes {{along the}} eastern edge of Mount Nebo Wildlife Management Area and crosses Hoop Pole Hill. North of <b>Sand</b> <b>Flat</b> Road, the highway passes Mayhew Inn Road, which leads west to Swallow Falls State Park. US 219 descends from Hoop Pole Ridge and reaches the southwestern shore of Deep Creek Lake in the hamlet of Thayerville. After passing Glendale Road, which heads east toward Deep Creek Lake State Park and other {{destinations}} {{on the east side of}} the lake, the highway turns northwest and parallels the west shore of the lake east of Roman Nose Hill. After passing Lakeshore Drive, US219 crosses the lake on the Deep Creek Bridge. The highway becomes a partially controlled access highway on the hillside above the lake, while Deep Creek Drive follows the shore. US219 continues north through the unincorporated village of McHenry. In McHenry, the highway intersects Mosser Road, which provides access to Garrett College and Garrett County Airport, and Sang Run Road, which leads to Wisp Ski Resort. After meeting the northern end of Deep Creek Drive, the highway leaves Deep Creek Lake and curves northeast at its junction with MD42 (Friendsville Road). US219 continues northeast along Rocklick Creek and the South Branch of Bear Creek. After leaving the South Branch, the highway follows Main Street through the town of Accident. Within the town, the highway intersects Accident Friendsville Road and Accident Bittinger Road, which heads east toward the James Drane House.|$|E

6000|$|But when I {{caught him}} {{saying that they}} [...] "bedded {{themselves}} down in the <b>sand,</b> <b>flat</b> side up, round side down," [...] I told him that my shoe could not do that, {{without the aid of}} my foot in it; at which he said that they merely settled down as they grew; if put down in a square they would be found so; but the clam could move quite fast. I have since been told by oystermen of Long Island, where the oyster is still indigenous and abundant, that they are found in large masses attached to the parent in their midst, and are so taken up with their tongs; in which case, they say, the age of the young proves that there could have been no motion for five or six years at least. And Buckland in his Curiosities of Natural History (page 50) says: [...] "An oyster who has once taken up his position and fixed himself when quite young can never make a change. Oysters, nevertheless, that have not fixed themselves, but remain loose {{at the bottom of the}} sea, have the power of locomotion; they open their shells to their fullest extent, and then suddenly contracting them, the expulsion of the water forwards gives a motion backwards. A fisherman at Guernsey told me that he had frequently seen oysters moving in this way." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{habitats}} of the Western Australian soldier crab, Mictyris occidentalis Unno 2008, {{were examined}} across its entire biogeographic range. The species transcends {{a range of}} environments from tropical, semi-arid to sub-tropical, arid climates, microtidal, macrotidal, to extremely macrotidal ranges, in different regional coastal sectors, and in various large-scale coastal geomorphic units such as barred lagoons, semi-protected beach/dune shores, and tidal creeks and lagoons in deltaic complexes and limestone barrier coasts. Locally, the species inhabits a variety of smaller-scale coastal geomorphic units (or habitats), including point bars, sloping beaches, shore parallel shoals, tidal-delta shoals, tidal-creek shoals, tidal-creek banks, <b>sand</b> <b>flats</b> at low neap-tidal levels to mean sea level, mid- to high-tidal <b>sand</b> <b>flats,</b> and in discrete areas it may occupy <b>sand</b> <b>flats</b> up {{to the level of}} high-water spring tide and near the highest astronomical tide. It also inhabits <b>sand</b> <b>flats</b> behind mangroves, and locally may occur on <b>sand</b> <b>flats</b> within mangrove vegetation. The most significant factors determining soldier crab habitats are relatively stable, low to moderate wave-energy environments (so that their subsurface air cavities are not continually disrupted), exposure during low tides so that they can swarm and carry out shallow horizontal tunnelling without tunnel collapse, and sandy substrates comprising fine to medium sand (125 μm to 250 μm modal grain size) that can be pelletised, with generally 3 ̆c 8...|$|R
