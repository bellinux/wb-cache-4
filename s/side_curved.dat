50|$|The {{corrugated}} iron skillion awning {{to the ground}} floor has paired timber posts to the central section, with triple timber posts either <b>side,</b> <b>curved</b> timber brackets and a solid valance for signage. The main entry is via a large arch to {{the north side of}} centre which accesses a recessed entry porch with a tiled floor, concrete balustrade and arched timber door, sidelights and fanlight assembly. The public bar is accessed via a timber and glass door with fanlight at the south, and a separate entrance to the lounge area is located to the north. The building has sash windows with arched headers, and the street facade has rendered details including sills, main entry arch and balustrade, and a deep skirting base.

50|$|In 1925 and 1989, the {{government}} of Chuangzhou city had called for Guangzhou city’s emblem twice. The first one was published in 1926. In the middle, it was {{the flag of the}} Republic of China, which was surrounded by five goats, and the around were wheat. The second one was published in 1990, in the middle, it is a five-pointed star, underneath is an artistic Chinese seal character—“羊” and a gold key formed by wheat. But this emblem also was abandoned in 1997. However, these two versions of emblems had also contained the images of the five goats and wheat, from which we can see how important they are for Guangzhou people. In 1936, {{the government}} of the Republic of China had also issued a kind of Yixian Bronze coin (now called “Guangdong Five Goats Bronze Coin”). In the front of the coin, a hole surrounded by petals in the middle, above was the date that this coin was made, and underneath the hole was the image of the five goats. In the reverse side of the coin, in the middle was the same hole, but was surrounded by five seal “Yang” characters. The outer sides were surrounded by a stem of wheat and on the other <b>side</b> <b>curved</b> “Yixian”, namely, the value of the coin.|$|E
40|$|The {{acoustical}} behaviour of an elliptical chamber muffler {{having a}} side inlet and side outlet port is analyzed in this paper, wherein a uniform velocity piston source {{is assumed to}} model the 3 -D acoustic field in the elliptical chamber cavity. Towards this end, we consider the modal expansion of the acoustic pressure field in the elliptical cavity {{in terms of the}} angular and radial Mathieu func-tions, subjected to the rigid wall condition. Then, the Green's function due to the point source lo-cated on the <b>side</b> (<b>curved)</b> surface of the elliptical chamber is obtained. On integrating this function over the elliptical piston area on the curved surface of the elliptical chamber and subsequent divi-sion by the area of the elliptic piston, one obtains the acoustic pressure field due to the piston driven source which is equivalent to considering plane wave propagation in the side ports. Thus, one can obtain the acoustic pressure response functions, i. e., the impedance matrix (Z) parameters due to the sources (ports) located on the side surface, from which one may also obtain a progressive wave rep-resentation in terms of the scattering matrix (S). Finally, the acoustic performance of the muffler is evaluated in terms of the Transmission loss (TL) which is computed in terms of the scattering pa-rameters. The effect of the axial length of the muffler and the angular location of the ports on the TL characteristics is studied in detail. The acoustically long chambers show dominant axial plane wave propagation while the TL spectrum of short chambers indicates the dominance of the trans-versal modes. The 3 -D analytical results are compared with the 3 -D FEM simulations carried on a commercial software and are shown to be in an excellent agreement, thereby validating the analyti-cal procedure suggested in this work...|$|E
