25|$|In the 17th century, Rembrandt {{painted a}} range of self-portraits. In The Prodigal Son in the Tavern (c1637), one of the {{earliest}} self-portraits with family, the painting probably includes Saskia, Rembrandt's wife, {{one of the earliest}} depictions of a family member by a famous artist. Family and professional group paintings, including the artist's depiction, became increasingly common from the 17th century on. From the later 20th century on, video plays an increasing part in self-portraiture, and adds the dimension of audio as well, allowing the person to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in their own voice.|$|E
500|$|He {{wrote that}} to the natives, the Christianity brought by the Spaniards had come to symbolize the {{brutality}} with {{which they had been}} treated; he quoted one Taino cacique (tribal chief), [...] "They tell us, these tyrants, that they adore a God of peace and equality, and yet they usurp our land and make us their slaves. [...] They <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> of an immortal soul and of their eternal rewards and punishments, and yet they rob our belongings, seduce our women, violate our daughters." ...|$|E

That they <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> as part of something greater than us—greater than any alien force. And if you and I are powerless now, I {{want to believe that}} if we listen to what's speaking, it can give us the power to save ourselves." [...] Despite their slim chance for success, Mulder declares, [...] "Maybe there's hope." ...|$|E

500|$|On October 22, {{after the}} work of the Commission had ended, Khrushchev invited the delegates to a dinner which, {{according}} to Alia, was used [...] "to threaten those parties which might oppose the line of the Soviets in November." [...] He gave as an example an exchange between Soviet Politburo member Yekaterina Furtseva and Kapo, in which the former asked, [...] "Are you Hysni Kapo?! I've heard so much about you..." [...] Kapo replied, [...] "For good or bad?" [...] to which Furtseva stated, [...] "You have attacked the Soviet Union, but you are heading for trouble on that course," [...] getting [...] "the reply she deserved" [...] from Kapo, with Alia further writing that [...] "her mission was just to transmit the signal. Throughout the whole dinner she did not <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> again." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Comines {{sector of}} the front there was an early fraternization between German and French {{soldiers}} in December 1914, during a short truce, and {{there are at least}} two other testimonials, from French soldiers, of similar behaviors in sectors where German and French companies opposed each other. [...] Gervais Morillon wrote to his parents: ‘The Boches waved a white flag and shouted [...] "Kamarades, Kamarades, rendez-vous." [...] When we didn’t move they came towards us unarmed, led by an officer. Although we are not clean they are disgustingly filthy. I am telling you this but don’t speak of it to anyone. We must not mention it even to other soldiers.’ Gustave Berthier wrote: ‘On Christmas day the Boches made a sign showing they wished to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> They said they didn’t want to shoot.... They were tired of making war, they were married like me, they didn’t have any differences with the French but with the English.’ ...|$|E

"There {{have been}} {{a huge number of}} {{companion}} books that have been published", said Neil Blair of Rowling's literary agency, Christopher Little, [...] "Ninety-nine percent have come to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> In every case they have made changes to ensure compliance.

2500|$|An undated, typewritten Bikini Kill tour flier {{answers the}} {{question}} [...] "What is Riot grrrl?" [...] with: [...] " [...] Because we girls {{want to create}} mediums that <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>US.</b> [...] We are tired of boy band after boy band, boy zine after boy zine, boy punk after boy punk after boy... Because {{we need to talk}} to each other. Communication and inclusion are key. [...] We will never know if we don't break the code of silence... Because in every form of media we see ourselves slapped, decapitated, laughed at, objectified, raped, trivialized, pushed, ignored, stereotyped, kicked, scorned, molested, silenced, invalidated, knifed, shot, choked and killed. Because a safe space needs to be created for girls where we can open our eyes and reach out to each other without being threatened by this sexist society and our day to day bullshit."Like other third wave feminists, riot grrrls attempted to foster an acceptance of diversity within feminist expression. That relationship to feminism is evident through their use of lyrics, zines and publications, and taking back the meaning of derogatory terms. [...] All three of these forms were claimed {{to be a source of}} empowerment for women in the movement.|$|E
2500|$|In {{discussing}} {{adapting the}} Boris Pasternak novel for television, screenwriter Andrew Davies revealed {{the task was}} [...] "daunting because the book is reckoned to be a masterpiece and the film is a great movie and one that I admire very much. Robert Bolt is the king of epic screenplay writers in my book. But as I got further into the book I kept thinking that I didn't agree with Robert Bolt about how to tell the story... and I began to feel much more excited." [...] He added, [...] "It was also a relief to find {{so much in the}} book that hadn't found its way into the first movie and could make great drama.... I thought the film does the spectacle really well. Rather surprisingly, it also explains the politics very well, but I thought it could do a better job on the relationships. It's probably a bit controversial, but I thought we could say more about Lara and Yuri and how they get together; about Lara's extraordinary situation {{at the beginning of the}} story and Yuri having a dreadful start to his life with his parents dying. None of these things really came out in the movie, but they are there in the book. I think that if they look at both versions now, people will probably think that this version in a lot of ways works better for our time. It's more contemporary. I think they'll find the performances are more subtle yet <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in our time. Maybe my script will seem out of date in 20 years time because a lot of them do, but watching the original film, I think the central performances look stilted and dated now." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Fathers of the Church {{recommended}} this practice: St. Jerome {{says that}} when we pray we <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> God; but when we read, God <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> St. Ambrose of Milan says the same: [...] "We address him when we pray; we hear him when we read." ...|$|R
