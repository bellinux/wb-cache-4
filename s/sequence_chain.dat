5000|$|Chunking is a {{flexible}} way of learning. Karl Lashley, {{in his classic}} paper on serial order (Lashley, 1951), argued that the sequential responses {{that appear to be}} organized in a linear and flat fashion concealed an underlying hierarchical structure. This was demonstrated in motor control by Rosenbaum et al. (1983). Thus sequences can consist of sub-sequences and these can in turn consist of sub-sub-sequences. Hierarchical representations of sequences have an edge over linear representations. They combine efficient local action at low hierarchical levels while maintaining the guidance of an overall structure. While the representation of a linear sequence is simple from storage point of view, there can be potential problems during retrieval. For instance, if there is a break in the <b>sequence</b> <b>chain,</b> subsequent elements will become inaccessible. On the other hand, a hierarchical representation would have multiple levels of representation. A break in the link between lower level nodes does not render any part of the sequence inaccessible, since the control nodes (chunk nodes) at the higher level would still be able to facilitate access to the lower level nodes.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Tunability of polymer surface {{properties}} depends crucially {{on both the}} chemical composition of the polymer and the physics of the chains (e. g., surface segregation, chain shape, etc.). Polypeptoids, which are non-natural biomimetic polymers based on an N-substituted glycine backbone, provide a flexible model system in which monomer <b>sequence,</b> <b>chain</b> shape, and self-assembled structure can easily be controlled to understand their influence on {{surface properties}}. We demonstrate {{the influence of the}} amount and sequence of hydrophobic monomers in a predominantly hydrophilic peptoid chain on the surface properties of a hybrid block copolymer, poly(peptoid-b-styrene). Just three fluorinated groups in peptoid sequences consisting of up to 45 hydrophilic monomers in length were needed to lower the surface energy of the peptoid and allow for its maximal surface segregation. Positioning these fluorinated groups {{in the middle of a}} chain as opposed to the chain ends resulted in a change in chain conformation at the surface as evidenced by near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) ...|$|E

40|$|A random coil, whose size is {{determined}} by its excluded volume, and net energetic interactions with its environment, {{has served as a}} representation of the unfolded ensemble of proteins. The work in this thesis involves equilibrium, nuclear magnetic resonance and time-resolved kinetics spectroscopic studies on the unfolded ensemble of BBL, a globally downhill folding 40 -residue protein involved the Krebs cycle of E. coli, in its acid-denatured state, and on a sequence-randomized version of this protein. The effect of variability in thermodynamic conditions, such as temperature and the presence of added chaotropes or kosmotropes, on the equilibrium properties and reconfiguration dynamics of the unfolded state, have been deduced in the absence of competition with folding events at low pH. The unfolded ensemble experiences expansion and collapse to varying degrees in response to changes in these conditions. Individual interactions of residues of the protein with the solvent and the cosolvent (direct interactions), and the properties of the solution itself (indirect interactions) are together critical to the unfolded chain's properties and have been quantitatively estimated. Unfolded, protonated BBL can be refolded by tuning the properties of the solvent by addition of kosmotropic salts. Electrostatic interactions turn out to be essential for folding cooperativity, while solvent-mediated changes in the hydrophobic effect can promote structure formation but cannot induce long-range thermodynamic connectivity in the protein. The effect of sequence on the properties of heteropolymers is also tested with a randomized version of BBL's <b>sequence.</b> <b>Chain</b> radii of gyration, and the degree and rate of hydrophobic collapse depend on the composition of the sequence, viz. hydrophilic versus hydrophobic content. However, the ability to maximize stabilizing interactions and adopt compact conformations is more evident in naturally selected protein sequences versus designed heteropolymers. Chain reconfiguration of unfolded BBL takes place in ∼ 1 /(100 ns), in agreement with theoretical estimates of homopolymer collapse rates. The refolding dynamics of salt-refolded BBL in the range of 1 /(6 μs) at 320 K, emerge as being independent of the degree of folding or protonation of the chain, a result in keeping with the description of dynamics in BBL as oscillations in a single, smooth harmonic potential well, which only varies in its position and curvature with varying thermodynamic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Traditional small {{molecule}} chemotherapeutics show limited {{effectiveness in}} the clinic as their poor pharmacokinetics lead to rapid clearance from circulation and their exposure to off-target tissues results in dose-limiting toxicity. The objective of this dissertation is to exploit a class of recombinant chimeric polypeptides (CPs) to actively target drugs to tumors as conjugation to macromolecular carriers has demonstrated improved efficacy by increasing plasma retention time, reducing uptake by healthy tissues, and enhancing tumor accumulation by exploiting the leaky vasculature and impaired lymphatic drainage characteristic of solid tumors. CPs consist of two principal components: (1) a thermally responsive elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) that displays a soluble-to-aggregate phase transition above a characteristic transition temperature (Tt); and (2) a cysteine-rich peptide fused to {{one end of the}} ELP to which small molecule therapeutics can be covalently attached (the conjugation domain). This work describes the development of CP drug-loaded nanoparticles that can be targeted to solid tumors by the external application of mild regional hyperthermia (39 - 43 °C). Highly repetitive ELP polymers were assembled by Plasmid Reconstruction Recursive Directional Ligation (PRe-RDL), in which two halves of a parent plasmid, each containing a copy of an oligomer, were ligated together to dimerize the oligomer and reconstitute the functional plasmid. Chimeric polypeptides were constructed by fusing the ELP sequence to a (CGG) 8 conjugation domain, expressed in Escherichia coli, and loaded with small molecule hydrophobes through site specific attachment to the conjugation domain. Drug attachment induced the assembly of nanoparticles that retained the thermal responsiveness of the parent ELP in that they experienced a phase transition from soluble nanoparticles to an aggregated phase above their Tt. Importantly, the Tt of these nanoparticles was near-independent of the CP concentration and the structure of the conjugated molecule as long as it displayed an octanol-water distribution coefficient (LogD) > 1. 5. A series of CP nanoparticles with varying ratios of alanine and valine in the guest residue position was used to develop a quantitative model that described the CP transition temperature in terms of three variables - <b>sequence,</b> <b>chain</b> length, and concentration - and the model was used to identify CPs of varying molecular weights that displayed transition temperatures between 39 °C and 43 °C. A murine dorsal skin fold window chamber model using a human tumor xenograft was used to validate that only the thermoresponsive CP nanoparticles (and not the controls) exhibited a micelle-to-aggregate phase transition between 39 - 43 °C in vivo. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of the biodistribution profile demonstrated that accumulation of these thermoresponsive CP nanoparticles was significantly enhanced by applying heat in a cyclical manner. It is hoped that this work will provide a helpful resource for the use of thermoresponsive CP nanoparticles in a variety of biomedical applications. Dissertatio...|$|E
