40|$|MBA 2014 ABSTRACT South African {{engineering}} {{companies who}} engage in project execution {{as part of their}} core business make use of <b>systems</b> <b>engineers</b> to perform certain project related tasks. Depending on the project phase, it is required that these tasks are completed at the project site, thus requiring the <b>systems</b> <b>engineer</b> to work onsite, away from their homes. Individual motivation of <b>systems</b> <b>engineers</b> is essential to their organisation, and can {{have a significant effect on}} project delivery time, productivity, budgets, absenteeism and project success (Beecham, Baddoo, Hall, Robinson, & Sharp, 2008). It is therefore essential for their employing organisations to strive to maintain a high level of motivation among its <b>systems</b> <b>engineers.</b> Working onsite presents both benefits and challenges to the <b>systems</b> <b>engineers,</b> and this may have an effect on the level of individual motivation of these <b>systems</b> <b>engineers.</b> The aim of this study was to assess the impact that working onsite has on the individual motivation of <b>systems</b> <b>engineers</b> in a South African engineering organisation. The research was exploratory and was done using a qualitative technique, making use of semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. The findings suggest that working onsite has both positive and negative effects on the individual motivation of <b>systems</b> <b>engineers.</b> The findings illustrate the key factors that motivate and de-motivate <b>systems</b> <b>engineers</b> whilst, and due to, working onsite. The key implication of the research is that it is essential that organisations maximise the motivating factors, whilst reducing or mitigating the de-motivating factors that <b>systems</b> <b>engineers</b> perceive to be present whilst working onsite, in order to increase their levels of motivation, or to maintain a high level of motivation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSystems {{engineering}} {{educators are}} struggling to meet the workforce development demand for senior <b>systems</b> <b>engineers.</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>engineers</b> are critical for addressing a broad set of increasingly complex systems problems faced by industry and government. However, the discipline is experiencing an outflux of senior <b>systems</b> <b>engineers</b> reaching retirement age with no ready source of <b>systems</b> <b>engineers</b> available to replace them, {{at a time when}} the demand for <b>systems</b> <b>engineers</b> is increasing (NDIA, 2010). The workforce challenge is to shorten the time it takes for a <b>systems</b> <b>engineer</b> to reach the senior level. The Systems Engineering Experience Accelerator (SEEA) research project was conceived as a critical response to these needs and challenges. The SEEA focuses on a solution that leverages technology to create an experience intended to accelerate the learning of systems engineering related competencies. This paper summarizes the operation of the preliminary version of a prototype SEEA simulator after the first year of the SEEA project. A review of the plans for future research is also included...|$|R
