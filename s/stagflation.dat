5|$|Friedman {{suggested}} that sustained Keynesian policies {{could lead to}} both unemployment and inflation rising at once – a phenomenon that soon became known as <b>stagflation.</b> In the early 1970s <b>stagflation</b> appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the 1973 oil crisis. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much {{of the general public}} with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other monetarists trained in the Chicago school of economics, by the Lucas critique and by criticisms from Hayek's Austrian School. So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 Robert Lucas claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.|$|E
5|$|The leading Western economies adopted Keynes's policy {{recommendations}} before {{the outbreak of}} World War II, and in the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946, almost all capitalist governments had done so. Keynes's influence waned in the 1970s, {{partly as a result}} of the <b>stagflation</b> that plagued the Anglo-American economies during that decade, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists. He and other economists had disputed the ability of government to regulate the business cycle favourably with fiscal policy.|$|E
5|$|Monetarism {{attracted}} the attention of policy makers in the late-1970s and 1980s. Friedman and Phelps's version of the Phillips curve performed better during <b>stagflation</b> and gave monetarism a boost in credibility. By the mid-1970s monetarism had become the new orthodoxy in macroeconomics, and by the late-1970s central banks in the United Kingdom and United States had largely adopted a monetarist policy of targeting money supply instead of interest rates when setting policy. However, targeting monetary aggregates proved difficult for central banks because of measurement difficulties. Monetarism faced a major test when Paul Volcker took over the Federal Reserve Chairmanship in 1979. Volcker tightened the money supply and brought inflation down, creating a severe recession in the process. The recession lessened monetarism's popularity but clearly demonstrated the importance of money supply in the economy. Monetarism became less credible when once-stable money velocity defied monetarist predictions and began to move erratically in the United States during the early 1980s. Monetarist methods of single-equation models and non-statistical analysis of plotted data also lost out to the simultaneous-equation modeling favored by Keynesians. Monetarism's policies and method of analysis lost influence among central bankers and academics, but its core tenets of the long-run neutrality of money (increases in money supply cannot have long-term effects on real variables, such as output) and use of monetary policy for stabilization became a part of the macroeconomic mainstream even among Keynesians.|$|E

25|$|By 1984, Reagan {{was very}} popular with voters across the nation as the President who saw {{them out of the}} {{economic}} <b>stagflation</b> of the early and middle 1970’s, and into a period of (relative) economic stability.|$|E
25|$|The American public's {{concerns}} about {{nuclear weapons and}} related technology continued {{to be present in}} the 1970s. The most talked about events in the 1970s were the Vietnam War, the Watergate scandal, the Iran hostage crisis, the energy crisis, and <b>stagflation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prior to the Reagan administration, the United States economy {{experienced}} {{a decade of}} rising unemployment and inflation (known as <b>stagflation).</b> Political pressure favored stimulus resulting in expansion of the money supply. President Richard Nixon's wage and price controls were phased out. The federal oil reserves were created to ease any future short term shocks. President Jimmy Carter began phasing out price controls on petroleum while he created the Department of Energy. Much {{of the credit for}} the resolution of <b>stagflation</b> is given to two causes: a three-year contraction of the money supply by the Federal Reserve Board under Paul Volcker, initiated {{in the last year of}} Jimmy Carter's presidency, and long-term easing of supply and pricing in oil during the 1980s oil glut.|$|E
25|$|Reagan carried 49 of the 50 states, {{becoming}} {{one of only two}} candidates to do so (the other was Richard Nixon in the 1972 presidential election). Reagan touted a strong economic recovery from 1970s <b>stagflation</b> and the 1981–82 recession, as well as the widespread perception that his presidency had overseen a revival of national confidence and prestige.|$|E
25|$|A failed {{monetary}} policy can have significant detrimental effects on an {{economy and the}} society that depends on it. These include hyperinflation, <b>stagflation,</b> recession, high unemployment, shortages of imported goods, inability to export goods, and even total monetary collapse and {{the adoption of a}} much less efficient barter economy. This happened in Russia, for instance, {{after the fall of the}} Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s it was {{apparent}} to some that this juggernaut of economic growth was slowing down, and it began to become visibly apparent in the early 1970s. The United States grew increasingly dependent on oil importation from OPEC after peaking production in 1970, resulting in oil supply shocks in 1973 and 1979. <b>Stagflation</b> gripped the nation, and the government experimented with wage and price controls under President Nixon.|$|E
25|$|Western {{central banks}} decided to sharply cut {{interest}} rates to encourage growth, deciding that inflation was a secondary concern. Although this was the orthodox macroeconomic prescription at the time, the resulting <b>stagflation</b> surprised economists and central bankers. The policy is now considered by some to have deepened and lengthened the adverse effects of the embargo. Recent research claims that in the period after 1985 the economy became more resilient to energy price increases.|$|E
25|$|The OPEC {{oil embargo}} marked a {{long-term}} economic transition since, {{for the first}} time, energy prices skyrocketed, and American factories faced serious competition from foreign automobiles, clothing, electronics, and consumer goods. By the late 1970s the economy suffered an energy crisis, slow economic growth, high unemployment, and very high inflation coupled with high interest rates (the term <b>stagflation</b> was coined). Since economists agreed on the wisdom of deregulation, many of the New Deal era regulations were ended, such as in transportation, banking, and telecommunications.|$|E
25|$|A {{swelling}} tide {{of criticism}} of Keynesian economics, most notably from Milton Friedman, a leading figure of monetarism, and the Austrian School's Friedrich Hayek, was unleashed by the <b>stagflation</b> of the 1970s. A {{series of events that}} contributed to this economic situation included Richard Nixon's imposition of wage and price controls on 15 August 1971 and unilateral cancellation of the Bretton Woods system in 1972, his ceasing the direct convertibility of the United States dollar to gold, as well as the 1973 oil crisis and the recession that followed.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasing}} frequency of strikes, increasingly directed against Perón {{as the economy}} slid into <b>stagflation</b> in late 1954, was dealt with through the expulsion of organizers from the CGT ranks. To consolidate his political grasp {{on the eve of}} colder economic winds, Perón called for a broad constitutional reform in September. The elected convention (whose opposition members soon resigned) approved the wholesale replacement of the 1853 Constitution of Argentina with a new magna carta in March, explicitly guaranteeing social reforms; but also allowing the mass nationalization of natural resources and public services, as well as the re-election of the president.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} the U.S. dollar was {{therefore}} no longer anchored to gold, and it fell upon the Federal Reserve to maintain the {{value of the}} U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve, however, continued to increase the money supply, resulting in <b>stagflation</b> and a rapidly declining value of the U.S. dollar in the 1970s. This was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were linked (the Phillips curve), and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign. Between 1965 and 1981, the U.S. dollar lost two thirds of its value.|$|E
25|$|Jimmy Carter, {{running as}} someone {{who was not a}} part of the Washington {{political}} establishment, was elected president in 1976. On the world stage, Carter brokered the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt. In 1979, Iranian students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 66 Americans hostage, resulting in the Iran hostage crisis. With the hostage crisis and continuing <b>stagflation,</b> Carter lost the 1980 election to the Republican Ronald Reagan. On January 20, 1981, minutes after Carter's term in office ended, the remaining U.S. captives held at the U.S. embassy in Iran were released, ending the 444-day hostage crisis.|$|E
25|$|From {{the end of}} the Great Depression {{until the}} early 1970s, Keynesian {{economics}} provided the main inspiration for economic policy makers in Western industrialized countries. The influence of Keynes's theories waned in the 1970s, due to <b>stagflation</b> and critiques from Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, Robert Lucas, Jr. and other economists, who were less optimistic about the ability of interventionist government policy to positively regulate the economy or otherwise opposed to Keynesian policies. From the early 1980s to 2008, the normative consensus among economists was that attempts at fiscal stimulus would be ineffective even in a recession, and such policies were only occasionally employed by the governments of developed countries.|$|E
25|$|Through the new Commonwealth Bank Act and the Banking Act 1945, {{the board}} was {{replaced}} by a six-member council, consisting of bank and treasury officials. It additionally formalised the bank's administrative powers of monetary and banking policy and exchange control and also stated the governor was responsible for managing the bank. Highly debated legislation in 1945 caused high amounts of regulation on private banks, which later-Governor H.C. Coombs was opposed to, along with his opposition to bank nationalisation in 1947. When he became governor in 1949, he allowed private banks to have more control over their liquidity and attempted to introduce market-based monetary policy. He also warned of the possibility of <b>stagflation</b> in 1959.|$|E
25|$|The 1990 General {{elections}} {{allowed the}} right-wing conservative alliance, the Islamic Democratic Alliance (IDA) led by Nawaz Sharif, {{to form the}} government under a democratic system {{for the first time}} in history. Attempts to end the <b>stagflation,</b> Sharif launched the privatization and economic liberalisation while on the other hand, adopted a policy of ambiguity on atomic bomb programs. Sharif intervened in Gulf War in 1991, and ordered an operation against the liberal forces in Karachi in 1992. Institutional problems arose with president Ghulam Khan, whose attempt was to dismiss Sharif on the same charges as he had pressed on Benazir Bhutto. Through the Supreme Court judgement, Sharif was restored and together with Benazir Bhutto ousted President Ishaq Khan from the presidency. Later in weeks, Sharif was forced to relinquish office by the military leadership.|$|E
25|$|During the recessions of the 1970s, {{inflation}} and unemployment rates soared simultaneously and budget deficits began to raise concerns among many Americans. In the early 1970s, America {{was still a}} moderately progressive country, as citizens supported social programs and voted down efforts to cut taxes. But {{by the end of}} the decade, a full-fledged tax revolt had gotten underway, led by the overwhelming passage in 1978 of Proposition 13 in California, which sharply cut property taxes, and the growing Congressional support for the Kemp-Roth tax bill, which proposed cutting federal income taxes by 30 percent. Supply-side economics developed during the 1970s in response to Keynesian economic policy, and in particular the failure of demand management to stabilize Western economies during the <b>stagflation</b> of the 1970s, in the wake of the oil crisis in 1973. It drew on a range of non-Keynesian economic thought, particularly the Chicago School and Neo-Classical School.|$|E
25|$|Benazir Bhutto {{presided over}} the country during the {{penultimate}} times of Cold war, and cemented pro-Western policies due to common distrust of communism. Her government oversaw the successful troop evacuation of Soviet Union from neighboring Communist Afghanistan. Soon after the evacuation, the alliance with U.S. came to end when the secret of a successful clandestine atomic bomb project was revealed to world which led to imposition of economic sanctions by the United States. In 1989, she ordered a military intervention in Afghanistan that brutally failed, leading her to depose {{the directors of the}} intelligence services. With offing American aid to the country, she hastily imposed the 7th Plan to restore the national economy while centralizing the economy. Nonetheless, the economic situation worsened when the state currency of Pakistan lost the currency war with India. The country significantly entered in era of <b>stagflation</b> during this period, and her government was soon dismissed by the conservative President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.|$|E
25|$|Even if {{the direct}} and {{indirect}} rebound effects add up to less than 100%, technological improvements that increase efficiency may still result in economy-wide effects that results in increased resource use for {{the economy as a}} whole. In particular, this would happen if increased resource efficiency enables an expansion of production in the economy, and an increase in the rate of economic growth. For example, for the case of energy use, more efficient technology is equivalent to a lower price for energy resources. It is well known that changes in energy costs have a large impact on economic growth rates. In the 1970s, sharp increases in petroleum prices led to <b>stagflation</b> (recession and inflation) in the developed countries, whereas in the 1990s lower petroleum prices contributed to higher economic growth. An improvement in energy efficiency has the same effect as lower fuel prices, and leads to faster economic growth. Economists generally believe that especially for the case of energy use, more efficient technologies will lead to increased use, because of this growth effect.|$|E
500|$|The 1970s {{and early}} 1980s saw {{the onset of}} <b>stagflation.</b> After his {{election}} in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of détente, he abandoned [...] "containment" [...] and initiated the more aggressive [...] "rollback" [...] strategy towards the USSR. After a surge in female labor participation over the previous decade, by 1985 {{the majority of women}} aged 16 and over were employed.|$|E
500|$|While Milton Friedman {{described}} The General Theory as [...] "a great book", {{he argues}} that its implicit separation of nominal from real magnitudes is neither possible nor desirable. Macroeconomic policy, Friedman argues, can reliably influence only the nominal. He and other monetarists have consequently argued that Keynesian economics can result in <b>stagflation,</b> the combination of low growth and high inflation that developed economies suffered in the early 1970s. More to Friedman's taste was the Tract on Monetary Reform (1923), which he regarded as Keynes's best work because of its focus on maintaining domestic price stability.|$|E
500|$|The Phillips curve {{appeared}} {{to reflect a}} clear, inverse relationship between inflation and output. The curve broke down in the 1970s as economies suffered simultaneous economic stagnation and inflation known as <b>stagflation.</b> The empirical implosion of the Phillips curve followed attacks mounted on theoretical grounds by Friedman and Edmund Phelps. Phelps, although not a monetarist, argued that only unexpected inflation or deflation impacted employment. Variations of Phelps's [...] "expectations-augmented Phillips curve" [...] became standard tools. Friedman and Phelps used models with no long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Instead of the Phillips curve they used models based on the natural rate of unemployment where expansionary monetary policy can only temporarily shift unemployment below the natural rate. Eventually, firms will adjust their prices and wages for inflation based on real factors, ignoring nominal changes from monetary policy. The expansionary boost will be wiped out.|$|E
500|$|Friedman's {{challenges}} {{to what he}} later called [...] "naive Keynesian" [...] theory began with his 1950s reinterpretation of the consumption function. In the 1960s, he became the main advocate opposing Keynesian government policies, and described his approach (along with mainstream economics) as using [...] "Keynesian language and apparatus" [...] yet rejecting its [...] "initial" [...] conclusions. He theorized that there existed a [...] "natural" [...] rate of unemployment, and argued that employment above this rate would cause inflation to accelerate. He argued that the Phillips curve was, in the long run, vertical at the [...] "natural rate" [...] and predicted what would {{come to be known}} as <b>stagflation.</b> Friedman promoted an alternative macroeconomic viewpoint known as [...] "monetarism", and argued that a steady, small expansion of the money supply was the preferred policy. His ideas concerning monetary policy, taxation, privatization and deregulation influenced government policies, especially during the 1980s. His monetary theory influenced the Federal Reserve's response to the global financial crisis of 2007–08.|$|E
500|$|The revised {{title of}} Winter in America was {{intended}} to represent Scott-Heron's use of the season of winter as a metaphor and concept of {{his view of the}} issues facing society during his time. The title was also meant to represent the urban sociological themes featured on the album, which had surfaced on most of Scott-Heron's previous work. Scott-Heron referred to the title as the [...] "overall atmosphere of the album", as well as the metaphor for the overall theme of the album. Winter was conceived amid social, economic and political issues in the United States during the early 1970s, including <b>stagflation,</b> the 1973 oil crisis that had great effect during the winter, the 1973 stock market crash, the Watergate scandal, and urban decay. He further elaborated on the social concept of winter and Afrocentricism, as it relates to living during times such as these and how the title reflects on the time itself, in the original LP liner notes: ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{her second}} term, Bhutto {{continued}} to follow {{former prime minister}} Nawaz Sharif's privatisation policies, which she called a [...] "disciplined macroeconomics policy". After the 1993 general elections, the privatisation programme of state-owned banks and utilities accelerated; more than ₨ 42 billion was raised {{from the sale of}} nationalised corporations and industries, and another US$20 billion from the foreign investment made the United States. After 1993, the country's national economy again entered in the second period of the <b>stagflation</b> and more roughly began bite the country's financial resources and the financial capital. Bhutto's second government found it extremely difficult to counter the second era of <b>stagflation</b> with Pressler amendment and the US financial and military embargo tightened its position. After a year of study, Bhutto implemented and enforced the Eighth Plan to overcome the <b>stagflation</b> by creating a dependable and effective mechanism for accelerating economic and social progress. But, according to American ambassador to Pakistan, William Milam's bibliography, Bangladesh and Pakistan:Flirting with Failure in South Asia, the Eighth Plan (which reflected the planned economy of the Soviet Union) was doomed to meet with failure {{from the very beginning of}} 1994, as the policies were weak and incoherent.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} many {{attempts}} to produce effective outcomes, the dramatic high rise in suicide, corruption, national security, high unemployment, {{and without the}} sustainable economic policies along with compilation of other factors, the country's economy re-entered in the [...] "era of stagflation" [...] (a virtual period that country had seen in 1990s earlier). The Pakistan economy slowed down dramatically to ~4.09% as compared to 8.96%—9.0% presided under his predecessor, Shaukat Aziz in 2004–08; while the yearly growth rate has come down from a long-term average of 5.0% to ~2.0%, though it did not reached to negative level. Calculation performed by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, it {{pointed out that the}} [...] "nation's currency in circulation as a percentage of total deposits is 31%, which is very high as compared to India", where 40.0% of the population fell under the line of poverty, with 16.0% rise in the inflation during his four years of presiding over the country. The new strict and tight monetary policy could not tame the soaring inflation, it did stagnate the economic growth. One economist maintained that <b>stagflation</b> took place when the tight monetary policy did not encourage the strong private sector to play a key part in growth. Analyzing the <b>stagflation</b> problem, the PIDE observed that a major cause of continuous era of <b>stagflation</b> in Pakistan was lack of co-ordination between fiscal and monetary authorities.|$|E
2500|$|Struggling under <b>stagflation</b> and an , all the {{domestic}} subcompact cars' sales slumped {{compared to the}} industry's record-breaking 1973 model year. In total, AMC sold 56,011 Gremlins in the (albeit shortened) 1975 model year, a 67% drop. The success of the innovative Pacer launched in mid-February 1975 [...] "severely cut" [...] the sales of both the Gremlin and Hornet models.|$|E
2500|$|Reagan reoriented American {{politics}} ad claimed {{credit in}} 1984 {{for an economic}} renewal—"It's morning in America again!" [...] was the successful campaign slogan. Income taxes were slashed 25% and the upper tax rates abolished. The frustrations of <b>stagflation</b> were resolved under the new monetary policies of Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, as no longer did soaring inflation and recession pull the country down. Working again in bipartisan fashion, the Social Security financial crises were resolved for the next 25 years.|$|E
2500|$|In his memoirs, Trudeau {{wrote that}} Turner said he {{resigned}} as Finance Minister in 1975 {{because he was}} tired of politics, after 13 years in Ottawa, and wanted to move on to a better-paying job as a lawyer in Toronto, to better support his family and to be with them more, as his children were growing up. [...] Trudeau also suggested that Turner's years as finance minister were very difficult because of turbulent and unusual conditions in the world economy, characterized as <b>stagflation,</b> largely caused by enormous increases in the price of oil.|$|E
2500|$|The {{economy was}} a great concern during the Ford administration. The economy had entered into a period of <b>stagflation,</b> which economists {{attributed}} to various causes, including the 1973 oil crisis and increasing competition from countries such as Japan. The end of the post-war boom created an opening for {{a challenge to the}} dominant Keynesian economics, and laissez-faire advocates such as Alan Greenspan acquired influence within the Ford administration. One of the first acts Ford took was to deal with the economy was to create, by Executive Order on September 30, 1974, the Economic Policy Board.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s, {{other high}} schools' {{students}} earned diplomas via Roosevelt's night classes and summer sessions while drug culture's emergence dissolved ethnic hostilities whereby a local gang, the Baldies, mostly Italian, had diminished enrollment by blacks and Hispanics, who amid halting economic progress began drug selling, common at Roosevelt by 1970, although heroin use lowered gang violence. [...] Yet atop national <b>stagflation,</b> the 1970s brought New York City's financial crisis, urban decay, soaring crime rates, and white flight. [...] The Bronx entered 1980 as urban decay's very portrait, and its high schools became notorious as the city's worst, while the crack epidemic struck, socially devastating Roosevelt.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1981 and 1992, the GDP {{increased}} {{at an average}} annual rate of only 2.9% and per capita income declined 6%. Gross investment, {{as a proportion of}} GDP, fell from 21 to 16 percent, in part {{as a result of the}} fiscal crisis and the loss of public-sector investment capacity. The decline also reflected growing uncertainties regarding the future of the economy. The 1980s became known as the [...] "lost decade," [...] and its problems spilled over into the 1990s. Despite the stagnation of the 1981–92 period, inflation remained a major problem (see <b>stagflation).</b> It stayed in the 100% level until the mid-80's and then grew to more than 1000% a year, reaching a record 5000% in 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Gillani was Prime Minister of Pakistan {{longer than}} any other person except Liaquat Ali Khan.

Failure of the grand paramilitary operation in Karachi further damaged Gilani's position in the public circles.
