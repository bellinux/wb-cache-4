5|$|How Do You <b>Solve</b> <b>a</b> <b>Problem</b> Like Maria? is a British reality {{television}} {{talent show}} that documented {{the search for}} an undiscovered musical theatre performer {{to play the role}} of Maria von Trapp in the 2006 Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Ian stage production of The Sound of Music.|$|E
5|$|A {{follow-up}} programme How Do You <b>Solve</b> <b>a</b> <b>Problem</b> Like Maria? – Connie's Story {{aired on}} 27 December 2006 and followed Fisher during rehearsals {{for her new}} role {{up to and including}} the opening night. Fisher and several other finalists appeared in a special programme on 24 December 2007 with the winner and finalists from Any Dream Will Do titled When Joseph Met Maria.|$|E
5|$|Barrowman {{was one of}} {{the regular}} presenters on Five channel's {{afternoon}} show 5's Company from 1997–1999. Barrowman read bedtime stories on the CBeebies channel between 1 and 5 May 2006. That summer, Barrowman was on a Judges panel with Andrew Lloyd Webber, David Ian, and Zoe Tyler on BBC One's music talent show How Do You <b>Solve</b> <b>a</b> <b>Problem</b> like Maria?.|$|E

5|$|Parallel computing, on {{the other}} hand, uses {{multiple}} processing elements simultaneously to <b>solve</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> This is accomplished by breaking the problem into independent parts so that each processing element can execute its part of the algorithm simultaneously with the others. The processing elements can be diverse and include resources such as a single computer with multiple processors, several networked computers, specialized hardware, or any combination of the above.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{computer}} software {{has been written}} for serial computation. To <b>solve</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> an algorithm is constructed and implemented as a serial stream of instructions. These instructions are executed on a central processing unit on one computer. Only one instruction may execute at a time—after that instruction is finished, the next one is executed.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{accounts}} of the introduction of polar coordinates {{as part of a}} formal coordinate system. The full history of the subject is described in Harvard professor Julian Lowell Coolidge's Origin of Polar Coordinates. Grégoire de Saint-Vincent and Bonaventura Cavalieri independently introduced the concepts in the mid-seventeenth century. Saint-Vincent wrote about them privately in 1625 and published his work in 1647, while Cavalieri published his in 1635 with a corrected version appearing in 1653. Cavalieri first used polar coordinates to <b>solve</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> relating to the area within an Archimedean spiral. Blaise Pascal subsequently used polar coordinates to calculate the length of parabolic arcs.|$|E

5|$|Logarithms {{have many}} {{applications}} {{inside and outside}} mathematics. Some of these occurrences {{are related to the}} notion of scale invariance. For example, each chamber of the shell of a nautilus is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor. This gives rise to a logarithmic spiral. Benford's law on the distribution of leading digits can also be explained by scale invariance. Logarithms are also linked to self-similarity. For example, logarithms appear in the analysis of algorithms that <b>solve</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> by dividing it into two similar smaller problems and patching their solutions. The dimensions of self-similar geometric shapes, that is, shapes whose parts resemble the overall picture are also based on logarithms.|$|E
5|$|Alongside his {{theatrical}} career, Barrowman {{has appeared}} in various films including the musical biopic De-Lovely (2004) and musical comedy The Producers (2005). Before venturing into British television, he featured in the American television dramas Titans and Central Park West but he is better known for his acting and presenting work for the BBC that includes his work for CBBC in its earlier years, his self-produced entertainment programme Tonight's the Night, and his BAFTA Cymru-nominated role of Captain Jack Harkness in the science fiction series Doctor Who and Torchwood. Barrowman has also {{had a number of}} guest roles in television programmes both in the US and the UK. He appeared as a contestant on the first series of celebrity ice skating show Dancing on Ice while his theatrical background allowed him to become a judge on Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical talent shows How Do You <b>Solve</b> <b>a</b> <b>Problem</b> like Maria?, Any Dream Will Do and I'd Do Anything. In 2006, he was voted Stonewall's Entertainer of the Year. Starting in 2013, he hosts the BBC One quiz show Pressure Pad. Barrowman starred in the CW's Arrow and Legends of Tomorrow as Malcolm Merlyn, the show's version of the DC villain Merlyn and one of the two series' main antagonists.|$|E
25|$|The {{relation}} between the complexity classes P and NP is studied in computational complexity theory, {{the part of the}} theory of computation dealing with the resources required during computation to solve a given problem.

On her return to the show, {{it was announced that}} Fisher would be reducing her workload to six shows a week, with Maria being played in the Monday evening and Wednesday matinee shows by Aoife Mulholland, one of the runners-up in How Do You <b>Solve</b> <b>A</b> <b>Problem</b> Like Maria?.|$|E
