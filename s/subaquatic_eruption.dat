This is the basic interpretation of rocks exposed in quarry near the town Zaječov. Rocks are part of geological area called Barrandien. Resediment volcaniclastic particles were transfer by sediment gravity flows. Agglomerates were deposited from volcaniclastic debris flow and fine grain volcanoclastics sediments from turbidity currents or hyperconcentrated flows. These types of flows named as eruption-fed aqueous density current are directly initiated by subaqueous volcanic eruption. One volcaniclastics strata set on the south wall of quarry was formed from <b>subaquatic</b> <b>eruption</b> plume, called steam copula. Steam copula created under the eruptive vent is water exclusion zone. Accretion lapilli can be formed in this zone if the copula is stable for a longer time. Accretion lapilli were {{generally considered to be}} able to form only in subaerial conditions, during the phreatomagmatic eruption till lately. Rocks exposed in quarry were probably formed during the Surtseyan eruption in shallow subaqueous setting. According to thin section lava flows are containing pseudomorphosis phenocrysts of olivine and [...] ...|$|E
