The use of matrices are generally accepted to transform surface atomic composition (i. e., C, O, N contents) into surface component composition (i. e., lactose, proteins, lipids). These atomic-based matrices were revisited and two new matrices based on the surface bond composition were developed. Surface compositions obtained from atomic and bond-based matrices were compared. A successful matrix allowing good correlations between XPS predicted and theoretical surface composition for powders free from fat was identified. Nevertheless, samples containing milk fat were found to present a possible <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>components</b> owing to the AMF overrepresentation on the surface.

The paper is devoted to the <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>components,</b> mainly sulphur, and the formation of manganese sulphide in the process of steel solidification, at the casting rate of 100 and 500 K/min. Sulphur is a steel component which disadvantageously influences its numerous parameters. The oxide-sulphide and sulphide precipitations cause cracks and lower the strength of the material. This phenomenon was modeled with the use of author’s computer program based on Matsumiya interdendritic microsegregation model. The main assumptions of this model and thermodynamic conditions of inclusion formation during casting of steel are discussed in this paper. Two cases were analyzed: in the first one the MnS was assumed to form a pure and constant compound, whereas in the other one the manganese sulfide was precipitated as a component of a liquid oxide solution, and its activity was lower than unity. The final conclusion is that chemical composition of steel is the major parameter deciding about the formation of MnS inclusions...|$|E

The length scales, polydispersity, complexity and ill-defined structures in weakly structured solutions makes them difficult to probe experimentally, and obscures understanding of their formation and stability. In this work we probe the nanostructure of homogenous binary mixtures of the ionic liquid (IL) propylammonium nitrate (PAN) and octanol as a function of composition using neutron diffraction and atomistic empirical potential structure refinement (EPSR) fits. These experiments reveal why octanol forms weakly structured aggregates in PAN but not in water, the mechanism by which PAN stabilises the octanol assemblies, and how the aggregate morphologies evolve with octanol concentration.

This {{process can be}} mimicked by transcriptional arrest after actinomycin D treatment leading to the <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> nucleolar <b>components</b> {{and the formation of}} unique structures termed nucleolar caps surrounding a central body. These nucleolar caps have been proposed to arise from the <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> nucleolar <b>components.</b> We show that contrary to prevailing notion, a group of nucleoplasmic proteins, mostly RNA binding proteins, relocalized from the nucleoplasm to a specific nucleolar cap during transcriptional inhibition. For instance, an exclusively nucleoplasmic protein, the splicing factor PSF, localized to nucleolar caps under these conditions. This structure also contained pre-rRNA transcripts, but other caps contained either nucleolar proteins, PML, or Cajal body proteins and in addition nucleolar or Cajal body RNAs. In contrast to the capping <b>of</b> the nucleoplasmic <b>components,</b> nucleolar granular component proteins dispersed into the nucleoplasm, although at least two (p 14 /ARF and MRP RNA) were retained in the central body.

40|$|Particle {{electrification}} is {{a common}} phenomenon that occurs in many powder handling industries such as pharmaceuticals and detergents etc. The unit operations involved {{in the manufacture of}} pharmaceutical formulations frequently subject particles to frictional sliding and impact against processing surfaces, giving rise to tribo-electric charging. Pharmaceutical materials, in particular, are susceptible to electrostatic charging due to their low bulk density, small particle size and often irregular shape and electrically insulating nature. The electrostatic charge may cause particles to adhere to container surfaces leading to a loss of powder through deposition; however the problem often extends further and affects the end products’ quality. Segregation can also occur when powders have been subjected to tribo-electrification. In this paper we investigate whether such adhesion resulting from the electrostatic charging could give rise to the <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>components</b> within a binary mixture. Binary mixtures comprising of α-lactose monohydrate (α-LM) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) were firstly tribo-charged and then the wall adhered particles were separated by a selective dissolution of one component and the filtration of the non-dissolving component, followed by a gravimetric analysis.

The influence of particle size distribution (PSD) of the powder mixtures on Casson yield stress parameter and on the minimum viscosity was also examined. Green densities increased as yield stress Casson parameter decreased. The mixture of alumina and zircon as fine and coarse powders produced bimodal PSD which maximized the green density of the compacts. Some weakly flocculated suspensions having low apparent viscosity and small yield stress produced casts with relatively high densification.

Furthermore, the relationship between tribo-electric charging and surface adhesion was also studied. The diversity in physicochemical properties of MC/HPMC has shown a significant impact on the tribo-electric charging and adhesion behaviour of theophylline.

Quantifying powder segregation using a reliable and robust method is challenging, particularly for low content level ingredients.

As a model system, a typical laundry detergent formulation, comprising spray-dried powder, known as Blown Powder (BP), Tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED) and enzyme placebo granules, is used.

40|$|Biological {{membranes}} {{are complex}} structures composed largely of proteins and lipids. These components {{have very different}} structural and physical properties and consequently they do not form a single homogeneous mixture. Rather components of the mixture are more enriched in some regions than in others. This can be demonstrated with simple lipid mixtures that spontaneously segregate components so as to form different lipid phases that are immiscible with one another. The segregation of molecular components of biological membranes also involves proteins. One driving force that would promote the segregation of membrane components is the preferential interaction between a protein and certain lipid components. Among the varied lipid components of mammalian membranes, the structure and physical properties of cholesterol {{is quite different from}} that of other major membrane lipids. It would therefore be expected that in many cases proteins would have very different energies of interaction with cholesterol vs. those of other membrane lipids.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is on the effects caused by α-helical {{peptides}} on liposome structure, the impact of cholesterol on the peptide-membrane interactions, {{and the effect of}} aggregate curvature on the peptide affinity. Results of the studies show that the membrane destabilizing effect of the cationic α-helical peptide melittin is modulated by cholesterol. Melittin induces leakage from pure phospholipid liposomes {{in a manner that is}} compatible with the presence of small pores. In the case of cholesterol-supplemented liposomes leakage coincides, however, with major structural transformations and rupture of the liposomes. Cholesterol decreases the affinity of melittin for phospholipid bilayers, but once the peptide has adsorbed to the membrane the presence of cholesterol does not offer any resistance against melittin-induced membrane destabilization. Our investigations indicate that cholesterol affects the alamethicin-lipid bilayer interactions in a similar way. PEG-stabilized bilayer disks are formed upon addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) -lipids to lipid mixtures with high bending rigidity. The partial <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>components</b> within the bilayer disk, suggested by theoretical calculations and experimental observations, was verified by small angle neutron scattering.

The bilayer disks have structural, and other properties, that make them interesting for the formulation of peptides and membrane-associated proteins.

Current methods available for measuring the dynamic charging of bulk powders are unsuitable for testing/handling small quantities of powders, some of which are highly active. Furthermore, very little work has been reported on the effect of tribo-electrification on the <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>components</b> of mixtures. A methodology has recently been developed for investigating the tribo-electrification of small quantities of bulk powders using a shaking device. Two common pharmaceutical excipients, namely α -lactose monohydrate (α -LM) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) were used as model materials. The electric charge transferred to the particles was quantified as a function of shaking time,frequency and container material. The temporal trend follows a first-order rate process. Using numerical simulations based on the Distinct Element Method (DEM), the charge accumulation of an assemblage of alumina beads inside the shaking device was analysed based on the single particle contact charge obtained from the experiments. It was shown that the inclusion of electrostatic mechanisms into the DEM model leads to an improved prediction of the charge buildup, but the difference with experimental data is still notable. Using the above method, segregation induced by tribo-electric charging was characterised for binary mixtures comprising α -LM and HPC. The bulk and wall-adhered particles were analysed for the mass fraction of each component using selective dissolution of one component and filtration of the non-dissolving component, followed by a gravimetric analysis. The findings reveal that a considerable level of segregation can take place on the wall-adhered particles.

Although it is likely that this protein {{plays an important role in}} controlling cell adhesion and migration, little is known about its actual function. To search for potential ICAP- 1 alpha-binding proteins, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified the human metastatic suppressor protein nm 23 -H 2 as a new partner of ICAP- 1 alpha. This direct interaction was confirmed in vitro, using purified recombinant ICA-P 1 alpha and nm 23 -H 2, and by coimmunoprecipitation from CHO cell lysates over-expressing ICAP- 1 alpha. The physiological relevance of this interaction is provided by confocal fluorescence microscopy, which shows that ICAP- 1 alpha and nm 23 -H 2 are colocalized in lamellipodia during the early stages of cell spreading. These adhesion sites are enriched in occupied 13, integrins and precede the formation of focal adhesions devoid of ICAP- 1 alpha and nm 23 -H 2, indicating the dynamic <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>components</b> of matrix adhesions. This peripheral staining of ICAP- 1 alpha and nm 23 - 1 - 12 is only observed in cells spreading on fibronectin and collagen and is absent in cells spreading on poly-L-lysine, vitronectin, or laminin. This is consistent with the fact that targeting of both ICAP- 1 alpha and nm 23 -H 2 to the cell periphery is dependent on 13, integrin engagement rather than being a consequence of cell adhesion.

Such observations indicate an alteration of the maturation processes in the keratinocytes of the psoriatic skin lesions and the characteristic nucleolar changes apparently represent the morphological expression of the altered inhibition of the nucleolar (preribosomal) RNA synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Surface <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> the non-noble <b>component</b> <b>of</b> a Pt {{bimetallic}} core−shell catalyst {{can occur}} even {{at room temperature}} under typical fuel cell cathode application conditions. While in an alkaline environment the nanoparticles remain stable, and the alteration in the surface composition can be tracked in situ; in an acidic electrolyte, any non-noble alloying material at the surface would immediately dissolve into the electrolyte. Therefore, such catalysts are expected to degrade steadily during operation in an acidic fuel cell until only Pt is left...|$|R
40|$|A mutant of Euglena {{gracilis}} Z {{is described}} that spontaneously produces irreversibly bleached mutants {{at a high}} frequency. Bleaching only occurs during exponential growth under highly aerobic conditions. The kinetics for bleaching and growth of bleached and nonbleached cells suggest that mutation is induced by <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> a cellular <b>component</b> that becomes limiting after several culture generations. The properties of spontaneous bleaching closely resemble the properties of induced organelle mutagenesis in E. gracilis and yeast...|$|R
