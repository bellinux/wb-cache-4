MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an attractive option in this direction. In this study, miRNA microarrays were performed on laser-microdissected hippocampal granule cell layer (GCL) and on plasma, at different time points {{in the development of}} pilocarpine-induced epilepsy in the rat: latency, first <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure</b> and chronic epileptic phase. Sixty-three miRNAs were differentially expressed in the GCL when considering all time points. Three main clusters were identified that separated the control and chronic phase groups from the latency group and from the first <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure</b> group. MiRNAs from rats in the chronic phase were compared to those obtained from the laser-microdissected GCL of epileptic patients, identifying several miRNAs (miR- 21 - 5 p, miR- 23 a- 5 p, miR- 146 a- 5 p and miR- 181 c- 5 p) that were up-regulated in both human and rat epileptic tissue. Analysis of plasma samples revealed different levels between control and pilocarpine-treated animals for 27 miRNAs. Two main clusters were identified that segregated controls from all other groups.

40|$|Summary: Purpose: Overexpression of multidrug {{transporters}} such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) {{may play}} a significant role in pharmacoresistance, by preventing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) from reaching their targets in the brain. Until now, many studies have described increased P-gp expression in epileptic tissue or have shown that several AEDs act as substrates for P-gp. However, definitive proof showing the functional involvement of P-gp in pharmacoresistance is still lacking. Here we tested whether P-gp contributes to pharmacoresistance to phenytoin (PHT) by using a specific P-gp inhibitor in a model of spontaneous seizures in rats. Methods: The effects of PHT on <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure</b> activity were investigated in the electrical post-status epilepticus rat model for temporal lobe epilepsy, before and after administration of tariquidar (TQD), a selective inhibitor of P-gp.

40|$|Pilocarpine (PILO) induces in rats limbic {{seizures}} {{that become}} secondarily generalized and evolve to status epilepticus (SE). <b>Spontaneous</b> recurrent <b>seizures</b> are registered during the long-term period following the systemic administration of PILO in rats. EEG, behavioral, and pathological features {{resemble those of}} complex partial seizures. the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) diazepam, phenobarbital (PB), valproic acid (VPA) and trimethadione protect against PILO-induced SE while phenytoin (PHT) and carbamazepine (CBZ) are ineffective. Studies with AEDs on <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> (chronic period) of this model {{have not yet been}} established. We now report the effects of different AEDs on <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures.</b> Male Wistar rats were subjected to PILO-induced SE.

PB 40 mg/kg, PHT 100 mg/kg, CBZ 120 mg/kg, VPA (450 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg) and ethosuximide (ETX) 400 mg/kg were given daily to epileptic rats for two weeks during the <b>spontaneous</b> recurrent <b>seizures</b> period.

Case description: A 53 -year-old woman with recurrent major depression was admitted to our psychiatry department for a major depressive episode of 6 weeks' duration, with psychotic symptoms. She was already on 200 mg/day of sertraline and 2 mg/day of risperidone. After 8 weeks on 200 mg/day of sertraline, 4 mg/day of risperidone and slow release bupropion (titrated to 300 mg/day), with no objective improvements, the decision was taken to initiate a course of 8 - 10 electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) sessions. Two days after the first treatment, three generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurred within 6 hours.

40|$|The {{expression}} of glial and neuronal glutamate transporter proteins {{was investigated in}} the hippocampal region at different time points after electrically induced status epilepticus (SE) in the rat. This experimental rat model for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by cell loss, gliosis, synaptic reorganization, and chronic seizures after a latent period. Despite extensive gliosis, immunocytochemistry revealed only an up-regulation of both glial transporters localized at the outer aspect of the inner molecular layer (iml) in chronic epileptic rats. The neuronal EAAC 1 transporter was increased in many somata of individual CA 1 - 3 neurons and granule cells that had survived after SE; this up-regulation was still present in the chronic epileptic phase. In contrast, a permanent decrease of EAAC 1 immunoreactivity was observed in the iml of the dentate gyrus. This permanent decrease in EAAC 1 expression, which was only observed in rats that experienced progressive <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure</b> activity, could lead to abnormal glutamate levels in the iml once new abnormal glutamatergic synaptic contacts are formed by means of sprouted mossy fibers.

40|$|Pilocarpine {{administration}} to rats results in status epilepticus (SE) {{and after a}} latency period to the occurrence of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures.</b> The model is commonly used to investigate mechanisms of epileptogenesis {{as well as the}} antiepileptic effects of novel compounds. Surprisingly, there have been no video-EEG studies determining the duration of latency period from SE to the appearance of the first <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> or the type and frequency of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> at early phase of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy even though such information is critical for design of such studies. To address these questions, we induced SE with pilocarpine in 29 adult male Wistar rats with cortical electrodes. Rats were continuously video-EEG monitored during SE and up to 23 days thereafter. The first <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> occurred 7. 2 +/- 3. 6 days after SE. During the follow-up, the mean daily seizure frequency was 2. 6 +/- 1. 9, the mean seizure duration 47 +/- 7 s, and the mean behavioral seizure score 3. 2 +/- 0. 9. Typically first seizures were partial (score 1 - 2). Interestingly, <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> occurred in clusters with cyclicity, peaking every 5 to 8 days. These data show that in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy the latency period is short. Because many of the early seizures are partial and the seizures occur in clusters, the true phenotype of epilepsy triggered by pilocarpine-induced SE may be difficult to characterize without continuous long-term video-EEG monitoring. Finally, our data suggest that the model can be used for studies aiming at identifying the mechanisms of seizure clustering. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that epilepsy {{is the result of}} synaptic reorganization and pathological excitatory loop formation in the central nervous system; however, the mechanisms that regulate this process are not well understood. We proposed that microRNA- 132 (miR- 132) and p 250 GAP might play important roles in this process by activating the downstream Rho GTPase family. We tested this hypothesis using a magnesium-free medium-induced epileptic model of cultured hippocampal neurons. We investigated whether miR- 132 regulates GTPase activity through p 250 GAP and found that Cdc 42 was significantly activated in our experimental model. Silencing miR- 132 inhibited the electrical excitability level of cultured epileptic neurons, whereas silencing p 250 GAP had an opposite effect. In addition, we verified the effect of miR- 132 in vivo and found that silencing miR- 132 inhibited the aberrant formation of dendritic spines and chronic <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure</b> in a lithium-pilocarpine-induced epileptic mouse model. Finally, we confirmed that silencing miR- 132 has a neuroprotective effect on cultured epileptic neurons; however, this effect did not occur through the p 250 GAP pathway. Generally, silencing miR- 132 may suppress <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure</b> activity through the miR- 132 /p 250 GAP/Cdc 42 pathway by regulating the morphology and electrophysiology of dendritic spines; therefore, miR- 132 may serve as a potential target for the development of antiepileptic drugs...|$|E

Moreover, this condition could increase the chances of developing neurological diseases, such as epilepsy. We analyzed the effects of early-life malnutrition on susceptibility to epileptic seizures induced by the pilocarpine model of epilepsy. Wistar rat pups were kept on a starvation regimen from day 1 to day 21 after birth. At day 60, 16 animals (8 = well-nourished; 8 = malnourished) {{were exposed to the}} pilocarpine experimental model of epilepsy. Age-matched well-nourished (n = 8) and malnourished (n = 8) rats were used as controls. Animals were video-monitored over 9 weeks. the following behavioral parameters were evaluated: first seizure threshold (acute period of the pilocarpine model); status epilepticus (SE) latency; first <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure</b> latency (silent period), and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure</b> frequency during the chronic phase. the cell and mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) density were evaluated in the hippocampal formation. Our results showed that the malnourished animals required a lower pilocarpine dose in order to develop SE (200 mg/kg), lower latency to reach SE, less time for the first <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure</b> and higher seizure frequency, when compared to well-nourished pilocarpine rats. Histopathological findings revealed a significant cell density reduction in the CA 1 region and intense MFS among the malnourished animals. Our data indicate that early malnutrition greatly influences susceptibility to seizures and behavioral manifestations in adult life. These findings suggest that malnutrition in infancy reduces the threshold for epilepsy and promotes alterations in the brain that persist into adult life. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

In this work, we analyzed GABA extracellular concentrations (using in vivo microdialysis under basal and high K+-evoked conditions) and loss of two GABA inteneuron populations (parvalbumin and somatostatin neurons) in the ventral hippocampus at different time-points after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in the rat, i. e. during development and progression of epilepsy. We found that (i) during the latent period between the epileptogenic insult, status epilepticus, and the first <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure,</b> basal GABA outflow was reduced to about one third of control values while the number of parvalbumin-positive cells was reduced by about 50 % and that of somatostatin-positive cells by about 25 %; nonetheless, high K+ stimulation increased extracellular GABA in a proportionally greater manner during latency than under control conditions; (ii) {{at the time of the}} first <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure</b> (i. e., when the diagnosis of epilepsy is made in humans) this increased responsiveness to stimulation disappeared, i. e. there was no longer any compensation for GABA cell loss; (iii) thereafter, this dysfunction remained constant until a late phase of the disease. These data suggest that a GABAergic hyper-responsiveness can compensate for GABA cell loss and protect from occurrence of seizures during latency, whereas impaired extracellular GABA levels can favor the occurrence of spontaneous recurrent seizures and the maintenance of an epileptic state.

Acute injury after SE was studied in the 2 -week-old rats 24 h after SE. Development of recurrent <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> was studied in 3 -week-old rats subjected to SE 4 months after the initial insult. None of those AIDs were effective in attenuating CA 1 injury in the 2 -week-old pups or in limiting the development of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> in 3 -week-old pups when administered individually. When empiric binary combinations of these drugs were tried, the combined targeting of IL- 1 r and COX- 2 resulted in attenuation of acute CA 1 injury, as determined 24 h after SE, in those animals.

In these experiments, paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate gyrus was reduced or lost after � 90 – 100 evoked seizures in association with emergence of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures.</b> Evoked IPSCs examined by single electrode voltage-clamp methods in granule cells from kindled rats experiencing <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> demonstrated altered kinetics (reductions of � 48 % in 10 – 90 % decay time, � 40 % in �, and � 65 % in charge transfer) and confirmed that decreased inhibition contributed to the reduced paired-pulse inhibition.

Ten patients who experienced seizures exclusively while playing or watching specific games were referred to as Group I, while 12 patients that had both game-induced and spontaneous seizures were classified as Group II. The patients in Group I had a middle-age onset (39. 1 years) with a male predominance (90 %). The electroencephalogram (EEG) or brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed non-specific abnormalities in 60 %, and the partial onset seizure was recognized in 30 % of patients. Antiepileptic drugs had uncertain benefits in this group. In Group II, patients had a male predominance (67 %), with onset during adolescence (16. 3 years). Most of them had generalized tonic–clonic seizures, myoclonic seizures, and absences, and 42 % showed epileptiform discharge on EEG. These 12 patients were categorized into idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Although photosensitivity was an important factor, higher mental activity seemed to be significant precipitants of seizures in Group II. Antiepileptic drugs were necessary and valproic acid alone or combined with clonazepam was effective in this group. The results showed that game-related seizures are not a unique and homogeneous syndrome and may consist of different mechanisms. Teenage onset, coexistent <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure,</b> and associated idiopathic generalized epilepsies were crucial factors in the determination of antiepileptic drug therapy.

After <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> (injured) dark neurons were mostly interneurons and were present in hippocampus (CA 1 stratum radiatum), amygdala, piriform cortex and other limbic structures.

40|$|PURPOSE: Overexpression of multidrug {{transporters}} such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) {{may play}} a significant role in pharmacoresistance, by preventing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) from reaching their targets in the brain. Until now, many studies have described increased P-gp expression in epileptic tissue or have shown that several AEDs act as substrates for P-gp. However, definitive proof showing the functional involvement of P-gp in pharmacoresistance is still lacking. Here we tested whether P-gp contributes to pharmacoresistance to phenytoin (PHT) by using a specific P-gp inhibitor in a model of spontaneous seizures in rats. METHODS: The effects of PHT on <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure</b> activity were investigated in the electrical post-status epilepticus rat model for temporal lobe epilepsy, before and after administration of tariquidar (TQD), a selective inhibitor of P-gp. RESULTS: A 7 -day treatment with therapeutic doses of PHT suppressed <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure</b> activity in rats, but only partially. However, an almost complete control of seizures by PHT (93 +/- 7 %) was obtained in all rats when PHT was coadministered with TQD. This specific P-gp inhibitor was effective in improving the anticonvulsive action of PHT during the first 3 - 4 days of the treatment. Western blot analysis confirmed P-gp upregulation in epileptic brains (140 - 200 % of control levels), along with approximately 20 % reduced PHT brain levels. Inhibition of P-gp by TQD significantly increased PHT brain levels in chronic epileptic rats. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that TQD significantly improves the anticonvulsive action of PHT, thus establishing a proof-of-concept that the administration of AEDs in combination with P-gp inhibitors may be a promising therapeutic strategy in pharmacoresistant patient...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacological}} treatment of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), {{the most common}} epileptic syndrome in adults, is still unsatisfactory, as {{one third of the}} patients are or become refractory to antiepileptic agents. Refractoriness may depend upon drug-induced alterations, but the disease per se may also undergo a progressive evolution that affects the sensitivity to drugs. mTLE {{has been shown to be}} associated with a dysfunction of the inhibitory signaling mediated by GABAA receptors. In particular, the repetitive activation of GABAA receptors produces a use-dependent decrease (rundown) of the evoked currents (IGABA), which is markedly enhanced in the hippocampus and cortex of drug-resistant mTLE patients. This phenomenon has been also observed in the pilocarpine model, where the increased IGABA rundown is observed in the hippocampus at the time of the first <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure,</b> then extends to the cortex and remains constant in the chronic phase of the disease. Here, we examined the sensitivity of IGABA to pharmacological modulation. We focused on the antiepileptic agent levetiracetam and on the neurotrophin BDNF, which were previously reported to attenuate mTLE-induced increased rundown in the chronic human tissue. In the pilocarpine model, BDNF displayed a paramount effect, decreasing rundown in the hippocampus at the time of the first seizure, as well as in the hippocampus and cortex in the chronic period. In contrast, levetiracetam did not affect rundown in the hippocampus, but attenuated it in the cortex. Interestingly, this effect of levetiracetam was also observed on the still unaltered rundown observed in the cortex at the time of the first <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure.</b> These data suggest that the sensitivity of GABAA receptors to pharmacological interventions undergoes changes during the natural history of mTLE, implicating that the site of seizure initiation and the timing of treatment may highly affect the therapeutic outcome. © 2013 Cifelli, Palma, Roseti, Verlengia and Simonato...|$|E
30|$|The {{development}} of chronic epilepsy {{can be the}} result of initial insults (e.g., tumor, infection, stroke, traumatic brain injury), brain malformations (e.g., focal cortical dysplasias, schizencephaly, and others), mutated genes (genetic epilepsies), or a component of a neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis). Often, there is a time lag between the first impact of the triggering factor and the occurrence of the first <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure.</b> During this period, the brain is functionally altered and primed to generate abnormal electrical activity. This process, named epileptogenesis, can take several years in humans and a few weeks in experimental animal models to produce epilepsy [1]. Extensive network modifications occur during epileptogenesis; they are believed to {{play a key role in}} the construction of epileptogenic circuits. Some of these alterations are a direct consequence of the initial trigger; others evolve during epileptogenesis. Cell death, aberrant synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity and neuroinflammation constitute three key mechanisms implicated in epileptogenesis.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{prolonged}} febrile seizures (FS) lead to {{structural and}} molecular changes that promote hippocampal hyperexcitability and reduce seizure threshold to further convulsants. However, whether these seizures provoke later-onset epilepsy, {{as has been}} suspected in humans, has remained unclear. Pre-viously, intermittent EEGs with behavioural observations for motor seizures failed to demonstrate sponta-neous seizures in adult rats subjected to experimental prolonged FS during infancy. Because limbic seizures may be behaviourally subtle, here we determined the presence of <b>spontaneous</b> limbic <b>seizures</b> using chronic video monitoring with concurrent hippocampal and cortical EEGs, in adult rats (starting around 3 months of age) that had sustained experimental FS on postnatal day 10. These subjects were compared with groups that had undergone hyperthermia but in whom seizures had been prevented (hyperthermic controls), {{as well as with}} normothermic controls. Only events that fulfilled both EEG and behavioural criteria, i. e. electro-clinical events, were considered <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures.</b> EEGs (over 400 recorded hours) were normal in all nor-mothermic and hyperthermic control rats, and none of these animals developed <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures.</b> In contrast, prolonged early-life FS evoked <b>spontaneous</b> electro-clinical <b>seizures</b> in 6 out of 17 experimental rats (35. 2 %). These seizures consisted of sudden freezing (altered consciousness) and typical limbic automatisms that were coupled with polyspike/sharp-wave trains with increasing amplitude and slowing frequency on EEG...|$|R

40|$|Acute {{seizures}} {{and status}} epilepticus induced by pilocarpine {{lead to the}} expression of Fos-like immunoreactivity in several specific brain areas {{in a manner similar}} to that of other models of limbic seizures. Upon development of status epilepticus after systemic pilocarpine injection, animals develop a state where chronic <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> recur. Assessment of Fos-like immunoreactivity after such <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> or after status epilepticus reinduction reveals either lack of staining or a weak reaction in a few brain areas including the ventral tip of the dentate gyrus, prepiriform, lateral piriform and perirhinal cortices, and scattered locations throughout temporal neocortex. Our results suggest that status epiiepticus induction may lead to a long-lasting state of Fos down-regulation.

40|$|AbstractWe present five {{patients}} of epilepsy in which seizures were triggered by playing or watching the traditional Chinese gambling game “Mah-Jong. ” One patient also experienced seizures while playing a computer {{version of the}} Mah-Jong game. This condition appeared to have a predominance of males (80 %) and middle-aged onset (39. 4 years). Four patients had generalized tonic-clonic seizures and one patient had partial seizures with secondary generalization. No <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure</b> occurred in these patients. Three patients had been receiving antiepileptic drug therapy, but without effective control over their seizures. Mah-Jong-induced epilepsy is a very peculiar form of complex reflex epilepsy that involves the higher mental activities. This phenomenon may consist of distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms from other reflex epilepsy induced by thinking and spatial tasks in idiopathic generalized epilepsies. This unusual reflex epilepsy is relatively benign in nature and antiepileptic drug therapy has uncertain benefits. It {{may be necessary to}} avoid playing the Mah-Jong game in order to prevent seizures...|$|E
40|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are characterized}} by periods of recurrent, highly synchronized activity that spontaneously terminates, followed by postictal state when neuronal activity is generally depressed. The mechanisms for <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure</b> termination and postictal depression remain poorly understood. Using a realistic computational model, we demonstrate that termination of seizure and postictal depression state may be mediated by dynamics of the intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations. Spontaneous termination was linked to progressive increase of intracellular sodium concentration mediated by activation of sodium channels during highly active epileptic state. In contrast, an increase of intracellular chloride concentration extended seizure duration making possible long-lasting epileptic activity characterized by multiple transitions between tonic and clonic states. After seizure termination, the extracellular potassium was reduced below baseline, resulting in postictal depression. Our study suggests that the coupled dynamics of sodium, potassium, and chloride ions {{play a critical role}} in the development and termination of seizures. Findings from this study could help identify novel therapeutics for seizure disorder...|$|E
40|$|Temporal lobe {{epilepsy}} {{is often}} medically refractory and new targets for intervention are needed. We used a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, on-line seizure detection, and responsive optogenetic intervention {{to investigate the}} potential for cerebellar control of spontaneous temporal lobe seizures. Cerebellar targeted intervention inhibited spontaneous temporal lobe seizures during the chronic phase of the disorder. We further report that the direction of modulation {{as well as the}} location of intervention within the cerebellum can affect the outcome of intervention. Specifically, on-demand optogenetic excitation or inhibition of parvalbumin-expressing neurons, including Purkinje cells, in the lateral or midline cerebellum results in a decrease in seizure duration. In contrast, a consistent reduction in <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizure</b> frequency occurs uniquely with on-demand optogenetic excitation of the midline cerebellum, and was not seen with intervention directly targeting the hippocampal formation. These findings demonstrate that the cerebellum is a powerful modulator of temporal lobe epilepsy, and that intervention targeting the cerebellum as a potential therapy for epilepsy should be revisited...|$|E

40|$|The GABAA {{receptor}} (GABAR) mediates fast synaptic inhibition in {{the brain}} and its subunit composition determines physiological and pharmacological properties of the receptor. In adult animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), GABAR αl subunit mRNA levels decrease in the dentate gyrus (DG) after status epilepticus (SE) and all animals subsequently develop <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures.</b> In contrast, when SE is induced in post-natal day 10 (P 10) rats, αl levels increase and none develop <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures.</b> Viral delivery of αl protects adult rats from development of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> following SE. Taken together, these findings suggest that αl down-regulation is potentially a critical determinant of epileptogenesis, however, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms that regulate αl transcription. In this thesis work I examined the role of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) family of transcription factors in regulating seizure-induced αl changes in adult and P 10 rats and the role of the JAK/STAT pathway as an upstream activator of this regulation. Using RT-PCR and western blotting, I find that phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) and inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) increase in DG of adult rats at 1 - 48 hours after SE. Interestingly, CREB and ICER do not change after SE in P 10 rats, suggesting there are distinct transcriptional regulators of αl at this age. Chromatin Immuno-precipitation and DNA pull-down assays show that pCREB and ICER binding at the CRE site of the αl subunit gene (Gabra 1) increases after SE, further supporting the role of CREB/ICER in seizure-induced Gabra 1 regulation. The JAK/STAT pathway is activated after SE in adults, as indicated by increases in pSTAT 1 and pSTAT 3 expression. Phosphorylated STAT 3 binds to the ICER promoter after SE and inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway via infusion of Pyridone 6 blocks ICER increases and αl decreases after SE, but may not inhibit development of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures.</b> These findings identify CREB, ICER and the JAK/STAT pathway as key regulators of GABAR αl transcription after SE in adults and identify novel potential therapeutic targets for preventing epileptogenesis. ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the effects of treatment with melatonin and N-acetilserotonin in the development of pilocarpina model of epilepsy in adult male rats. METHODS: Part I - The animals were divided in 4 groups: SALINE - animals that received only saline; SE - animals submitted to status epilepticus (SE); NAS + SE - animals that received pre-treatment with N-acetylserotonin and were submitted to SE and MEL + SE - animals that received pre-treatment with melatonin and were submitted to SE. Part II - The animals were divided in 6 groups: SALINE - animals that received only saline; SE - animals submitted to status epilepticus (SE); PX + SE - animals submitted to pinealectomy and to SE 7 days later; SH + SE - animals submitted to sham-surgery and to SE 7 days later; SE + NAS - animals submitted to SE and treated with N-acetylserotonin (2, 5 mg/kg), 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 48 h after the SE and SE + MEL - animals submitted to SE and treated with melatonin (2, 5 mg/kg), 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 48 h after the SE. Following the treatment the animals were continuously video-recorded for 60 days. The behavioral parameters were observed: latency for the SE in minutes, latency for the first <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> (ie, duration of the silent period), number of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> during the chronic period and mortality. Five animals per group were perfused for neo-Timm assay. RESULTS: Part I - The animals treated with melatonin and N-acetylserotonin presented an increased of latency for the status epilepticus and decreased number of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> during the chronic period when compared to SE group. The mortality was reduced 100 % in animals treated with melatonin and theses animals presented a minor mossy fibers sprouting. Part II - The latency for the first <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> and mortality were similar in all groups. The animals treated with melatonin presented a decreased number of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>seizures</b> during the chronic period when compared to PX + SE group and a minor mossy fibers sprouting when compared to SE, SH + SE and PX + SE groups. CONCLUSION: Our data show that the melatonin and N-acetylserotonin have an important neuroprotector effect in the epileptogenesis and in the control of seizures during the chronic period of the pilocarpina model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpina.
