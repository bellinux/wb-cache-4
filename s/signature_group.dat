40|$|<b>Group</b> <b>signature</b> is {{a useful}} {{cryptographic}} primitive, which makes every group member sign messages {{on behalf of a}} group they belong to. Namely <b>group</b> <b>signature</b> allows that <b>group</b> member anonymously signs any message without revealing his/her specific identity. However, <b>group</b> <b>signature</b> may make the signers abuse their signing rights if there are no measures of keeping them from abusing signing rights in the <b>group</b> <b>signature</b> schemes. So, <b>group</b> manager must be able to trace (or reveal) the identity of the signer by the signature when the result of the signature needs to be arbitrated, and some revoked group members must fully lose their capability of signing a message on behalf of the group they belong to. A practical model meeting the requirement is verifier-local revocation, which supports the revocation of group member. In this model, the verifiers receive the group member revocation messages from the trusted authority when the relevant signatures need to be verified. With the rapid development of identity-based cryptography, several identity-based <b>group</b> <b>signature</b> (IBGS) schemes have been proposed. Compared with <b>group</b> <b>signature</b> based on public key cryptography, IBGS can simplify key management and be used for more applications. Although some identity-based <b>group</b> <b>signature</b> schemes have been proposed, few identity-based <b>group</b> <b>signature</b> schemes are constructed in the standard model and focus on the traceability of signature.

40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} between the type I interferon (IFN) signature and clinical response to rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Twenty RA patients were treated with rituximab (cohort 1). Clinical response was defined as a decrease in the Disease Activity Score evaluated in 28 joints (DAS 28) and as a response according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria at week 12 and week 24. The presence of an IFN signature was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by measuring the expression levels of 3 IFN response genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. After comparison with the findings in healthy controls, patients were classified as having an IFN high or an IFN low signature. The data were confirmed in a second independent cohort (n = 31). Serum IFNα bioactivity was analyzed using a reporter assay. In cohort 1, there was a better clinical response to rituximab in the IFN low <b>signature</b> <b>group.</b> Consistent with these findings, patients with an IFN low signature had a significantly greater reduction in the DAS 28 and more often achieved a EULAR response at weeks 12 and 24 as compared with the patients with an IFN high signature in cohort 2 versus cohort 1. The pooled data showed a significantly stronger decrease in the DAS 28 in IFN low signature patients at weeks 12 and 24 as compared with the IFN high <b>signature</b> <b>group</b> and a more frequent EULAR response at week 12. Accordingly, serum IFNα bioactivity at baseline was inversely associated with the clinical response, although this result did not reach statistical significance.
