40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to better {{understand}} leadership in faith-based nonprofits (FNPs) through interviews of managers and executive directors of FNPs. In addition, based upon the data gathered, to construct an FNP leadership paradigm (FLP). To assist in this effort, the Covenantal Framework of Action (CFA) was introduced to serve as a theoretical framework for assessing FNP organizational/ leadership processes and influences. CFA is characterized by noncentralization, participatory decision-making, and <b>servant</b> leadership. <b>Construction</b> <b>of</b> the FNP leadership paradigm and its comparison to CFA revealed that FLP and CFA were similar along every dimension of CFA...|$|R

40|$|Transportation has {{historically}} {{had a major}} influence on cities - their locations, growth and form. Civil engineers were the leading public <b>servants</b> in <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> railway and transit systems. With diversification of transportation and, particularly, growth of highways, the solutions to urban transportation have become extremely complex. Instead of only building new facilities, it is now necessary to coordinate different modes. Planning of transportation is defined at four levels: individual facilities, single mode networks, intermodal systems and city-transportation relationships. It is shown that the latter two levels have not been adequately performed. Coordination of systems must be given greater attention. A brief review of successes and failures in urban transportation in different countries, with particular emphasis on Japan, is given at the end. The transportation and civil engineers 2 ̆ 7 roles should change to include a much greater emphasis on systems approach in planning, design, operation and policy. It is particularly important that engineers give attention to the methods for achieving efficient and attractive cities...|$|R

50|$|A long {{tradition}} exists in literature <b>of</b> the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> an artificial embodiment {{of a certain}} type of ideal woman, and fictional gynoids have been seen as an extension of this theme. Examples include Hephaestus in the Iliad who created female <b>servants</b> <b>of</b> metal, and Ilmarinen in the Kalevala who created an artificial wife. Probably most famous, however, is Pygmalion, one of the earliest conceptualizations <b>of</b> <b>constructions</b> similar to gynoids in literary history, from Ovid's account of Pygmalion. In this myth a female statue is sculpted that is so beautiful that the creator falls in love with it, and after praying to Venus, the goddess takes pity on him and converts the statue into a real woman, Galatea, with whom Pygmalion has children.|$|R
