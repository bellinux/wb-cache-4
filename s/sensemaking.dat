25|$|Several {{cognitive}} processes related to situation awareness are briefly {{described in this}} section. The matrix shown below attempts to illustrate the relationship among some of these concepts. Note that situation awareness and situational assessment are more commonly discussed in information fusion complex domains such as aviation and military operations and relate more to achieving immediate tactical objectives. <b>Sensemaking</b> and achieving understanding are more commonly found in industry and the organizational psychology literature and often relate to achieving long-term strategic objectives.|$|E
2500|$|Klein, Moon, and Hoffman {{distinguish}} between situation awareness and <b>sensemaking</b> as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|In brief, <b>sensemaking</b> {{is viewed}} more as [...] "a motivated, {{continuous}} {{effort to understand}} connections (which can be among people, places, and events) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively", rather than the state of knowledge underlying situation awareness. Endsley points out that as an effortful process, <b>sensemaking</b> is actually considering {{a subset of the}} processes used to maintain situation awareness. In {{the vast majority of the}} cases, SA is instantaneous and effortless, proceeding from pattern recognition of key factors in the environment—"The speed of operations in activities such as sports, driving, flying and air traffic control practically prohibits such conscious deliberation in the majority of cases, but rather reserves it for the exceptions." [...] Endsley also points out that <b>sensemaking</b> is backward focused, forming reasons for past events, while situation awareness is typically forward looking, projecting what is likely to happen in order to inform effective decision processes.|$|E
2500|$|.....situation {{awareness}} {{is about the}} knowledge state that's achieved—either knowledge of current data elements, or inferences drawn from these data, or predictions {{that can be made}} using these inferences. In contrast, <b>sensemaking</b> is about the process of achieving these kinds of outcomes, the strategies, and the barriers encountered.|$|E
50|$|A 2014 {{review of}} the {{literature}} on <b>sensemaking</b> in organizations identified a dozen different categories of <b>sensemaking</b> and a half-dozen <b>sensemaking</b> related concepts (Maitlis & Christianson, 2014). The categories of <b>sensemaking</b> included: constituent-minded, cultural, ecological, environmental, future-oriented, intercultural, interpersonal, market, political, prosocial, prospective, and resourceful. The sensemaking-related concepts included: sensebreaking, sensedemanding, sense-exchanging, sensegiving, sensehiding, and sense specification.|$|E
5000|$|Brenda Dervin {{developed}} {{the concept of}} <b>sensemaking.</b> <b>Sensemaking</b> considers how we (attempt to) make sense of uncertain situations. [...] Her description of <b>Sensemaking</b> consisted {{of the definition of}} how we interpret information to use for our own information related decisions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sensemaking</b> {{is central}} to the {{conceptual}} framework for military network-centric operations (NCO) espoused by the United States Department of Defense (Garstka and Alberts, 2004). In a joint/coalition military environment, <b>sensemaking</b> is complicated by numerous technical, social, organizational, cultural, and operational factors. A central hypothesis of NCO is that the quality of shared <b>sensemaking</b> and collaboration will be better in a [...] "robustly networked" [...] force than in a platform-centric force, empowering people to make better decisions. According to NCO theory, there is a mutually-reinforcing relationship among and between individual <b>sensemaking,</b> shared <b>sensemaking,</b> and collaboration.|$|E
50|$|The idea of <b>sensemaking</b> {{is also a}} theme within Organizational Information Theory. Organizational <b>sensemaking</b> {{contrasts}} with organizational interpretation. When an organization interprets information, {{there is already a}} frame of reference in place and this is enough information for an organization to change course. <b>Sensemaking</b> occurs, however, when no initial frame of reference exists and no obvious connection presents itself. According to Weick, <b>sensemaking</b> can be driven by beliefs or actions. Beliefs shape what people experience and give form for the actions they take. For example, disagreement about beliefs in an organization can lead to arguments. This is a form of <b>sensemaking.</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{a seminal}} paper on <b>sensemaking</b> in the human-computer {{interaction}} (HCI) field {{was published in}} 1993 (Russell et al., 1993), {{there was a great}} deal of activity around the understanding of how to design interactive systems for <b>sensemaking,</b> and workshops on <b>sensemaking</b> were held at prominent HCI conferences (e.g., Russell et al., 2009).|$|E
50|$|Also, as Karl Weick {{explains}} <b>sensemaking</b> as {{the process}} of conceptualising problems, concept-driven strategy might {{be thought of as}} a pragmatic means of <b>sensemaking</b> a strategy.|$|E

5000|$|The theory also neglects {{the larger}} social, {{historical}} and institutional context. The {{role of the}} institutional context and cultural-cognitive institutions in <b>sensemaking</b> should be paid more attention to. According to Taylor and Van Every, [...] "what is missing Weick’s 1995 <b>Sensemaking</b> in Organizations ... is {{an understanding of the}} organization as a communicational construction or an awareness of the institutionalizing of human society that accompanies organization with its many internal contradictions and tensions". Actors are constrained by cognition through socialization in the job, school system and the media when they do <b>sensemaking</b> in institutions. It causes less variety and more stability in institutions. In order to expand the theory, social mechanism can be applied to consider how institutions prime, edit and trigger <b>sensemaking</b> besides the traditional cognitive constraint.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Sensemaking</b> is {{a social}} {{activity}} in that plausible stories are preserved, retained or shared (Isabella, 1990; Maitlis, 2005). However, the audience for <b>sensemaking</b> includes the speakers themselves (Watson, 1995) and the narratives are 'both individual and shared...an evolving product of conversations with ourselves and with others' (Currie & Brown, 2003: 565).|$|E

50|$|LVT {{is a form}} of <b>sensemaking.</b> It {{enables the}} {{rewriting}} of the ‘story of the situation’ to better articulate meaningful connections between ‘molecules of meaning’ such as events and people in conditions of ambiguity that challenge current representations. <b>Sensemaking</b> is a two-way process between ‘data’ (as MMs) and frames of reference to articulate intelligent trajectories into the future.|$|E
50|$|Critics of {{this theory}} assert {{that it does}} not deal {{significantly}} with hierarchy or conflict, two prominent themes associated with organizational communications. In some cases, the hierarchical context makes difficulties for <b>sensemaking</b> and proposes a flow of downward negative feedback. <b>Sensemaking</b> process can be applied to explain why employees remain silence in the organization. Two <b>sensemaking</b> resources which are expectation and identity preclude employees from giving upward negative feedback. Employees expect that their negative feedback for supervisors will pose threat to their job security or might be neglected by supervisors. Besides, employees make sense of their own understanding and identify themselves as deficient experts who are unable to make best decisions.|$|E

50|$|In {{organization}} studies, {{the concept}} of <b>sensemaking</b> was first used {{to focus attention on}} the largely cognitive activity of framing experienced situations as meaningful.

Weick in particular has dealt with <b>sensemaking</b> in organizations, providing insight into factors that surface as organizations address either uncertain or ambiguous situations (Weick, 1979, 1988, 1993; Weick et al., 2005).|$|E
