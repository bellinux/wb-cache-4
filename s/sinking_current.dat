50|$|A {{push-pull}} amplifier {{is a type}} of electronic circuit that uses a pair of active devices that alternately supply current to, or absorb current from, a connected load. Push-pull outputs are present in TTL and CMOS digital logic circuits and in some types of amplifiers, and are usually realized as a complementary pair of transistors, one dissipating or <b>sinking</b> <b>current</b> from the load to ground or a negative power supply, and the other supplying or sourcing current to the load from a positive power supply.|$|E
5000|$|However, most commercially {{available}} [...] "electronic DC loads" [...] or [...] "programmable DC loads" [...] {{on the market}} cannot source power, since by being DC loads, by strict definition, {{they do not need}} to. (They are not power supplies), being only able to absorb power (<b>sinking</b> <b>current</b> from a positive voltage, or sourcing to a negative voltage). These most commonly use one transistor/FET, or an array of parallel connected transistors/FETs for more current handling, to act as a variable resistor. Internal circuitry in the equipment monitors the actual current through the transistor/FET, compares it to a user-programmed desired current, and through an error amplifier changes the drive voltage to the transistor/FET to dynamically change its resistance. This 'negative feedback' results in the actual current always matching the programmed desired current, regardless of other changes in the supplied voltage or other variables. Of course, if the power source is not able to supply the desired amount of current, the DC load equipment cannot furnish the difference; it can restrict current to a level, but it cannot boost current to a higher level. Most commercial DC loads are equipped with microprocessor front end circuits that allow the user to not only program a desired current through the load ('constant current' or CC), but the user can alternatively program the load to have a constant resistance (CR) or constant power dissipation (CP).|$|E

5000|$|More complex {{analysis}} than fan-in and fan-out {{is required}} when two different logic families are interconnected. Fan-out is ultimately {{determined by the}} maximum source and <b>sink</b> <b>currents</b> of an output and the maximum source and <b>sink</b> <b>currents</b> of the connected inputs; the driving device {{must be able to}} supply or sink at its output the sum of the currents needed or provided (depending on whether the output is a logic high or low voltage level) by all of the connected inputs, while maintaining the output voltage specifications. For each logic family, typically a [...] "standard" [...] input is defined by the manufacturer with maximum input currents at each logic level, and the fan-out for an output is computed as the number of these standard inputs that can be driven in the worst case. (Therefore, it is possible that an output can actually drive more inputs than specified by fan-out, even of devices within the same family, if the particular devices being driven sink and/or source less current, as reported on their data sheets, than a [...] "standard" [...] device of that family.) Ultimately, whether a device has the fan-out capability to drive (with guaranteed reliability) a set of inputs is determined by adding up all the input-low (max.) source currents specified on the datasheets of the driven devices, adding up all the input-high (max.) <b>sink</b> <b>currents</b> of those same devices, and comparing those sums to the driving device's guaranteed maximum output-low <b>sink</b> <b>current</b> and output-high source current specifications, respectively. If both totals are within the driving device's limits, then it has the DC fan-out capacity to drive those inputs on those devices as a group, and otherwise it doesn't, regardless of the manufacturer's given fan-out number. However, for any reputable manufacturer, if this current analysis reveals that the device cannot drive the inputs, the fan-out number will agree.|$|R
50|$|To {{understand}} how the inverter operates, {{it is necessary to}} understand the current flow. If the bias current is shunted to ground (low logic level), the transistor turns off and the collector floats (high logic level). If the bias current is not shunted to ground because the input is high-z (high logic level), the bias current flows through the transistor to the emitter, switching on the transistor, and allowing the collector to <b>sink</b> <b>current</b> (low logic level). Because the output of the inverter can <b>sink</b> <b>current</b> but cannot source current, it is safe to connect the outputs of multiple inverters together to form a wired AND gate. When the outputs of two inverters are wired together, the result is a two-input NOR gate because the configuration (NOT A) AND (NOT B) is equivalent to NOT (A OR B) (per De Morgan's Theorem).|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{layout design}} to {{effectively}} reduce the layout {{area of the}} thin-oxide NMOS and PMOS devices in CMOS output buffers with ESD consideration is proposed. With respect to the traditional finger-type layout, the large-dimension output NMOS and PMOS devices are realized by multiple octagonal cells. Without using extra ESD-optimization process, the output NMOS and PMOS devices in this octagon-type layout can provide higher driving/sinking current and better ESD robustness within smaller layout area. The drain-to-bulk parasitic capacitance at the output node is also reduced by this octagon-type layout.

40|$|International audience—Microbial {{fuel cells}} (MFCs) are sources {{harvesting}} energy from organic matters and showing great promise in powering environmental sensors. Because {{of the low}} power and voltage issues (100 µW at 0. 3 V for 20 cm² electrodes), an electrical interface is required to extract the maximum power delivered by the MFC and boost the output voltage. However the switching operation of most converters induces a pulsed <b>sinking</b> <b>current</b> which may cause additional dynamic losses inside the MFC. Following a previous study on a flyback converter in discontinuous conduction mode, this paper analyzes the effect of switching of the converter on the MFC internal losses. A dynamic model of the MFC is deduced from an impedance spectroscopy characterization: it reveals a double RC behavior, one with a time constant of 10 s of s, the other one of 100 s of µs. Then in the frequency-domain, the MFC dynamic losses, induced by a previously optimized flyback, are calculated: they represent 50 % of the maximum power that can be extracted from the MFC. Eventually {{in order to reduce}} these losses, we study the impact of three flyback parameters (primary inductance, duty cycle and decoupling capacitance). Adding a capacitance of 10 µF at the converter input, the MFC dynamic losses become negligible...|$|E

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} two {{specific}} applications of fully-integrated switched-capacitor DC-DC converters, namely wide range operation and two-quadrant operation. For switched-capacitor DC-DC converters to operate efficiently {{over a wide}} input or output voltage range, multiple Voltage Conversion Ratios (VCRs) are required, to counteract the losses associated to its output impedance. To achieve wide range operation, this work proposes to use the Dickson topology as its foundation, transforming it into a wide range topology called the folding Dickson topology. Here, multiple VCRs are achieved through changing the phases of the switches. This operation lumps two or more flying capacitors into a single flying capacitor, which allows the emulation of new VCRs. Furthermore, a small modification to the output stage increases the amount of VCRs even more. These findings were validated through silicon measurements, and boasted an average efficiency of 71 % over an input voltage range from 2. 5 V up to 8 V, {{which is more than}} 4. 5 times the technologies supply voltage. The regularity of this topology allows it to be extended to achieve even higher voltage ranges, at a minimal design overhead. Two-quadrant DC-DC converters on the other hand might alleviate issues that are encountered with getting the ever increasing currents on-chip. In stead of supplying loads in parallel, they are put in stacked voltage domains. The shared node now needs to be balanced by a DC-DC converter, capable of both sourcing and <b>sinking</b> <b>current.</b> Switched-capacitor DC-DC converters require two VCRs to achieve both modes of operation. This work presented the first fully-integrated two-quadrant switched-capacitor DC-DC converter, capable of supplying loads in stacked voltage domains with variable load voltages (0. 75 - 1. 1 V), while very high systems efficiencies up to 99. 6 % are achievable thanks to the low-power two-fold control loop. nrpages: 190 status: publishe...|$|E
