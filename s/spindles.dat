40|$|During mitosis, {{chromosome}} passenger complexes (CPCs) {{exhibit a}} well-conserved {{association with the}} anaphase <b>spindle</b> and have been implicated in <b>spindle</b> stability. However, their precise effect on the <b>spindle</b> is not clear. In this paper, we show, in budding yeast, that a CPC consisting of CBF 3, Bir 1, and Sli 15, but not Ipl 1, is required for normal <b>spindle</b> elongation. CPC mutants slow <b>spindle</b> elongation through {{the action of the}} bipolar kinesins Cin 8 and Kip 1. The same CPC mutants that slow <b>spindle</b> elongation also result in the enrichment of Cin 8 and Kip 1 at the <b>spindle</b> midzone. Together, these findings argue that CPCs function to organize the <b>spindle</b> midzone and potentially switch motors between force generators and molecular brakes. We also find that slowing <b>spindle</b> elongation delays the mitotic exit network (MEN) -dependent release of Cdc 14, thus delaying <b>spindle</b> breakdown until a minimal <b>spindle</b> size is reached.

40|$|<b>Spindle</b> length varies {{dramatically}} across {{species and}} during early development to segregate chromosomes optimally. Both intrinsic factors, such as regulatory molecules, and extrinsic factors, such as cytoplasmic volume, determine <b>spindle</b> length scaling. However, the properties that govern <b>spindle</b> shape and whether these features can be modulated remain unknown. Here, we analyzed quantitatively how the molecular players which regulate microtubule dynamics control the kinetics of <b>spindle</b> formation and shape. We find that, in absence of Clasp 1 and Clasp 2, <b>spindle</b> assembly is biphasic due to unopposed inward pulling {{forces from the}} kinetochore-fibers and that kinetochore-fibers also alter <b>spindle</b> geometry. We demonstrate that <b>spindle</b> shape scaling is independent {{of the nature of}} the molecules that regulate dynamic microtubule properties, but is dependent on the steady-state metaphase <b>spindle</b> length. The shape of the <b>spindle</b> scales anisotropically with increasing length. Our results suggest that intrinsic mechanisms control the shape of the <b>spindle</b> to ensure the efficient capture and alignment of chromosomes independently of <b>spindle</b> length...|$|R

40|$|To {{overcome}} the imbalance between <b>spindle</b> heat generation and dissipation caused by existed <b>spindle</b> cooling strategies, this paper develops a power matching based cooling strategy for motorized <b>spindle</b> unit.

Based on this principle, the power matching between <b>spindle</b> heat generations and dissipations is realized by the real-time power estimations of <b>spindle</b> heat sources and the modified constant supply cooling powers strategy.

40|$|AbstractThe meiotic <b>spindle</b> is a bipolar {{molecular}} machine {{that is designed}} to segregate duplicated chromosomes toward the opposite poles of the cell. The size and shape of the <b>spindle</b> are considered to be maintained by a balance of forces produced by molecular motors and microtubule assembly dynamics. Several studies have probed how mechanical perturbations of the force balance affect the <b>spindle</b> structure. However, the <b>spindle’s</b> response to a stretching force acting at the <b>spindle</b> pole and along its long axis, i. e., the direction in which chromosomes are segregated, has not been examined. Here, we describe a method to apply a stretching force to the metaphase <b>spindle</b> assembled in Xenopus egg extracts and measure the relationship between the force and the three-dimensional deformation of the <b>spindle.</b> We found that the <b>spindle</b> behaves as a Zener-type viscoelastic body when forces are applied at the <b>spindle</b> pole, generating a restoring force for several minutes.

However, the relatively normal <b>spindle</b> elongation kinetics in yeast cohesin mutants indicates an additional {{mechanism for the}} temporal control of <b>spindle</b> elongation. Here we show evidence indicating that S-phase CDK (cyclin dependent kinase) negatively regulates <b>spindle</b> elongation. In contrast, mitotic CDK promotes <b>spindle</b> elongation by activating Cdc 14 phosphatase, which reverses the protein phosphorylation imposed by S-phase CDK. Our data suggest that S-phase CDK negatively regulates <b>spindle</b> elongation partly through its phosphorylation of a <b>spindle</b> pole body (SPB) protein Spc 110. We also show that hyperactive S-phase CDK compromises the microtubule localization of Stu 2, a processive microtubule polymerase essential for <b>spindle</b> elongation. Strikingly, we found that hyperactive mitotic CDK induces uncoupled <b>spindle</b> elongation and sister-chromatid separation in securin mutants (pds 1 D), and we speculate that asynchronous chromosome segregation in pds 1 D cells contributes to this phenotype.
