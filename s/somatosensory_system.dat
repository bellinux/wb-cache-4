25|$|A second study, {{conducted}} by Moscovitch and Behrmann, investigated the reference frame of neglect {{with respect to}} the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>system.</b> Eleven patients with parietal lobe lesions and subsequent hemispatial neglect were analyzed during this experiment. A double simultaneous stimulation procedure was utilized, during which the patients were touched lightly and simultaneously on the left and right side of the wrist of one hand. The patients were tested both with their palms facing down and with their palms facing up. This experimental condition allowed the scientists to determine whether neglect in the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>system</b> occurs {{with respect to the}} sensory receptor surface (egocentric) or with respect to a higher-order spatial frame of reference (allocentric). The results of this experiment showed the hemispatial neglect patients neglected somatosensory stimuli on the contralesional side of space, regardless of hand orientation. These findings suggest that, within the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>system,</b> stimuli are neglected with respect to the allocentric, spatial frame of reference, in addition to an egocentric, sensory frame of reference. Ultimately, the discoveries made by these experiments indicate that hemispatial neglect occurs with respect to multiple, simultaneously derived frames of reference, which dictate {{the nature and extent of}} neglect within the visual, auditory, and tactile fields.|$|E
40|$|Tinnitus can be evoked or {{modulated}} by {{input from}} the <b>somatosensory</b> and somatomotor <b>systems.</b> This means that the loudness or intensity of tinnitus can be changed by sensory or motor stimuli such as muscle contractions, mechanical pressure on myofascial trigger points, transcutaneous electrical stimulation or joint movements. The neural connections and integration of the auditory and <b>somatosensory</b> <b>systems</b> of the upper cervical region and head have been confirmed by many studies. These connections can {{give rise to a}} form of tinnitus known as somatosensory tinnitus. To date only a handful of publications have focussed on (cervicogenic) somatosensory tinnitus and manual therapy. Broadening the current understanding of somatosensory tinnitus would represent a first step towards providing therapeutic approaches relevant to manual therapists. Treatment modalities involving the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>systems,</b> and particularly manual therapy, should now be re-assessed in the subgroup of patients with cervicogenic somatosensory tinnitus. The conceptual phase of this study aims to uncover underlying mechanisms linking the auditory and <b>somatosensory</b> <b>systems</b> in relation to subjective tinnitus through (i) review of the literature (part 1) and (ii) through design of a pilot study that will explore characteristics of the study population and identify relevant components and outcomes of manual therapy in patients with cervicogenic somatosensory tinnitus (part 2).

25|$|Conventional SSEPs {{monitor the}} {{functioning}} of the part of the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>system</b> involved in sensations such as touch and vibration. The part of the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>system</b> that transmits pain and temperature signals is monitored using laser evoked potentials (LEP). LEPs are evoked by applying finely focused, rapidly rising heat to bare skin using a laser. In the central nervous system they can detect damage to the spinothalamic tract, lateral brain stem, and fibers carrying pain and temperature signals from the thalamus to the cortex. In the peripheral nervous system pain and heat signals are carried along thin (C and A delta) fibers to the spinal cord, and LEPs can be used to determine whether a neuropathy is located in these small fibers as opposed to larger (touch, vibration) fibers.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{gustatory}} {{disorders are}} challenging to diagnose and evaluate. Because gustatory functions {{are tied to}} the sense of smell, the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>system,</b> and the perception of pain (such as in tasting spicy foods), it is difficult to examine sensations mediated through an individual system. In addition, gustatory dysfunction is rare when compared to olfactory disorders.|$|E

25|$|At {{the systems}} level, the {{questions}} addressed in systems neuroscience include how neural circuits are formed and used anatomically and physiologically to produce {{functions such as}} reflexes, multisensory integration, motor coordination, circadian rhythms, emotional responses, learning, and memory. In other words, they address how these neural circuits function and the mechanisms through which behaviors are generated. For example, systems level analysis addresses questions concerning specific sensory and motor modalities: how does vision work? How do songbirds learn new songs and bats localize with ultrasound? How does the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>system</b> process tactile information? The related fields of neuroethology and neuropsychology {{address the question of}} how neural substrates underlie specific animal and human behaviors. Neuroendocrinology and psychoneuroimmunology examine interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine and immune systems, respectively. Despite many advancements, the way networks of neurons perform complex cognitive processes and behaviors is still poorly understood.|$|E

A common example of this reflex is the cat righting reflex, which allows them to orient themselves in order to land on their feet. This reflex is initiated by sensory information from the vestibular, visual, and the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>systems</b> and is therefore not only a vestibulospinal reflex.|$|R
40|$|During haptic {{exploration}} of surfaces, complex mechanical oscillations—of surface displacement and air pressure—are generated, {{which are then}} transduced by receptors in the skin and in the inner ear. Tactile and auditory signals thus convey redundant information about texture, partially carried in the spectral content of these signals.

2500|$|Merzenich and William Jenkins (1990) {{initiated}} studies relating sensory experience, without pathological perturbation, to cortically observed plasticity in the primate <b>somatosensory</b> <b>system,</b> {{with the}} finding that sensory sites activated in an attended operant behavior increase in their cortical representation. Shortly thereafter, Ford Ebner and colleagues (1994) made similar efforts in the rodent whisker barrel cortex (also part of the <b>somatosensory</b> <b>system).</b> These two groups largely diverged over the years. The rodent whisker barrel efforts became a focus for Ebner, Matthew Diamond, Michael Armstrong-James, Robert Sachdev, and Kevin Fox. Great inroads were made in identifying the locus of change as being at cortical synapses expressing NMDA receptors, and in implicating cholinergic inputs as necessary for normal expression.
