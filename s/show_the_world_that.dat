5|$|With Soviet troops already {{stationed}} in the country according to the Mutual Assistance Treaty, {{it was impossible to}} mount effective military resistance. On June 15, Lithuania unconditionally accepted the ultimatum and lost its independence. The Soviets sought to <b>show</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> this was not a military occupation and annexation, but a legitimate socialist revolution, initiated by the local population demanding to join the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviets followed semi-legal procedures: they took control of the government institutions, installed a new puppet government, and carried out show elections to the People's Seimas. During its first session, the Seimas proclaimed creation of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and petitioned to be admitted into the Soviet Union. The petition was officially accepted by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on August 3, 1940. At the same time almost identical processes took place in Latvia and Estonia. Lithuania would not regain its independence until the proclamation of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania on March 11, 1990.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, Italy {{had lost}} half its {{merchant}} fleet through wartime destruction and Allied forces seeking war reparations. The losses included the scuttling/bombing of the SS Rex, a former Blue Riband holder. Furthermore, the country was struggling with a collapsed economy. To <b>show</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> the country had recovered from the war and to re-establish the nation's pride, the Italian Line commissioned two new vessels of similar design in the early 1950s. The first was to be named Andrea Doria, after the 16th-century Genoese admiral Andrea Doria. The second vessel, which was launched in 1953, was to be named Cristoforo Colombo after explorer Christopher Columbus.|$|E
25|$|Parker {{was looking}} ahead to the future when he persuaded Presley to sign up as a regular soldier.

Parker, on the other hand, was fully aware that any special treatment given to Presley would instantly be used against him in the media and by those who disliked his style of music. If Presley could <b>show</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> he was just the same as any other young man, Parker told him, then more people would be likely to accept him and his music. Parker was also afraid that any attempt to block Presley from being drafted would result in a more detailed look into his own service record. He also realized that it would be a great opportunity to promote Presley by having the media witness his induction day, including the Army haircut that would see the most famous hair style in the world destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Saṅkalpa (Hindi: सङ्कल्प, meaning Resolution): The canto {{begins with}} the concept of {{resolution}} – the poet states that a noble resolution is the true and pure resolution. Aṣṭāvakra is born handicapped, and a son Śvetaketu is born to Uddālaka at the same time. Both uncle and nephew grow up together in Uddālaka's Āśrama. Uddālaka is more fond of Aṣṭāvakra, his disabled grandson, than Śvetaketu. Aṣṭāvakra excels in learning from Uddālaka, outclassing all other disciples including Śvetaketu. On Aṣṭāvakra's tenth birthday, Uddālaka organises a celebration. Uddālaka makes Aṣṭāvakra sit in his lap and starts embracing him. Seeing this, Śvetaketu is possessed by jealousy, and asks Aṣṭāvakra to get down from his father's lap. Śvetaketu tells him that Uddālaka is actually his grandfather, and that he does not know about his real father. Śvetaketu further humiliates Aṣṭāvakra by mocking his disability. On hearing about his real father Kahola from Sujātā, Aṣṭāvakra thanks Śvetaketu for awakening him. Aṣṭāvakra makes a firm resolution of not returning to Uddālaka's Āśrama without his father. The resolution will <b>show</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> the disabled can achieve anything they dream of.|$|E

500|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{a new style}} of novel became popular in France. The serial format known as the roman-feuilleton {{presented}} stories in short regular installments, often accompanied by melodramatic plots and stock characters. Although Balzac's La Vieille Fille (The Old Maid), 1836, was the first such work published in France, the roman-feuilleton gained prominence thanks mostly to his friends Eugène Sue and Alexandre Dumas, père. Balzac disliked their serial writing, however, especially Sue's socialist depiction of lower-class suffering. Balzac wanted to dethrone what he called [...] "les faux dieux de cette littérature bâtarde" [...] ("the false gods of this bastard literature"). He also wanted to <b>show</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that,</b> despite his poor health and tumultuous career, he was [...] "plus jeune, plus frais, et plus grand que jamais" [...] ("younger, fresher, and greater than ever"). His first efforts to render a quality feuilleton were unsuccessful. Even though Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes ("A Harlot High and Low"), published in segments from 1838 to 1847, was celebrated by critics, Balzac complained to Mme. Hanska that he was [...] "doing pure Sue". He tried again in 1844 with Modeste Mignon, but public reactions were mixed. Two years later Balzac began a new project, determined to create something from his [...] "own old pen again".|$|E
