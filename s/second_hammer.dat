In 2006 the Russian Government renamed a street after him.|$|E

50|$|The {{rules of}} the game are the same as those in the {{original}} Adventure Island, with the main new feature being the addition of an inventory system. Before the player begins a stage, he can choose which of Higgins' animal friends to bring (if he has rescued any), as well as whether or not he should bring one of the stone hammers he has accumulated. Because of this, the player can no longer upgrade to shooting fireballs when he picks a <b>second</b> <b>hammer.</b> Instead, it gets added as a reserved hammer to the player's inventory.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} predicting penetration resistance for driven piles, using known driving records for driving the same type piling in similar subsurface conditions. As known driving records are not always available to the analyst, a method was also investigated using soil data only. The analytical tools employed included the Tilley pile driving formula and the wave equation, as programmed for computer solution by T. C. Edwards. Predictions were made for five projects where driving records were available for two different hammers. Predictions were made for one hammer using a statistically determined mean driving record of the <b>second</b> <b>hammer,</b> and vice-versa. Predictions were also made using only soil data for both hammers. In comparing the predicted values with the actual mean field values, {{it was found that}} reliable penetration resistance versus depth relationships could be predicted using a known driving record with either the Hi ley formula or the wave equation. Predictions made using only soil data were found to be reasonable, though significantly more inaccurate than those using a known driving record. Where only soil data was used, {{it was found that the}} wave equation is a better predictive tool than the Hiley formula...|$|E

The Zulu axe was used to chop up a leg of beef, being measured at a velocity of 23 mph. The Zulu axe was given the edge because of its longer reach and higher speed.|$|R
