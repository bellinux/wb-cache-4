In most of the compartmental models, absorption could be represented by a primary and secondary compartment. The percentage of Ca absorbed increased as calcium intake decreased so that the amount of calcium absorbed was not greatly affected by changes in the dietary intake or abomasal contents of calcium. Also, there were no differences due to treatment in the amount of calcium absorbed by primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>absorption.</b> The percentage of P absorbed did not vary between treatments, although the percentage absorbed by primary absorption was higher in sheep on low phosphorus diets. For <b>secondary</b> <b>absorption,</b> the percentage absorbed was higher in sheep on high phosphorus diets. The amount of phosphorus absorbed by primary absorption was the same for all treatments; however, sheep on low phosphorus diets absorbed very little phosphorus by <b>secondary</b> <b>absorption,</b> whereas sheep on high phosphorus diets absorbed 2. 5 times as much phosphorus as those on low phosphorus diets. The amounts of mineral absorbed by primary absorption for phosphorus and calcium, and by <b>secondary</b> <b>absorption</b> for calcium, were not altered by changes in the amount of phosphorus or calcium mixed with the tracer, indicating that primary absorption may be saturable for phosphorus and calcium and <b>secondary</b> <b>absorption</b> for calcium. The large absorption of phosphorus by the secondary compartment was proportional to the amount of phosphorus in the lower small intestine and therefore the phosphorus was probably absorbed by a non-saturable mechanism...|$|E

Integration of multiple modules would provide an amount of power that exceeds {{the power of a}} single module by combining and directing the coherent beams to the user's receiver. The model developed for the DSPIL system conservatively predicts the laser output power (50 kW) that appears much less than the laser output (93 kW) obtained from the gain volume ratio extrapolation of experimental data. The difference in laser outputs may be attributed to reflector configurations adopted in both design and experiment. Even though the photon absorption by multiple reflections in experimental cavity setup was more efficient, the maximum <b>secondary</b> <b>absorption</b> amounts to be only 24. 7 percent of the primary. However, the gain volume ratio shows 86 percent more power output than theoretical estimation that is roughly 60 percent more than the contribution by the <b>secondary</b> <b>absorption.</b> Such a difference indicates that the theoretical model adopted in the study underestimates the overall performance of the DSPIL.

The dielectric loss isotherms aboveTg exhibit a blurred relaxation resulting from the overlapping of secondary relaxations with the glass-rubber or R relaxation. At high temperatures and low frequencies, the R relaxation is hidden by the ionic conductive contribution to the dielectric loss. As usual, the real component of the complex dielectric permittivity in the frequency domain increases with decreasing frequency until a plateau is reached corresponding to the glass-rubber (R) relaxation. However, at high temperatures, the real permittivity starts to increase again with decreasing frequency until a second plateau is reached, a process that presumably reflects a distributed Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars relaxation or R 0 absorption. The R and R 0 processes appear respectively as asymmetric and symmetric relaxations in the loss electrical modulus isotherms in the frequency domain. To facilitate the deconvolution of the overlapping absorptions, the time retardation spectra of the polymers were computed from the complex dielectric permittivity in the frequency domain using linear programming regularization parameter techniques. The spectra exhibit three <b>secondary</b> <b>absorptions</b> named, in increasing order of time γ 0, γ, and β followed by the R relaxation. At long times and well separated from the R absorption the R 0 relaxation appears. The replacement of the hydrogen of the phenyl group in position 2 by the oxymethyl moiety enhances the dielectric activity of the poly- (dimethoxybenzyl methacrylate) s.

Two-photon absorption (TPA) is a central problem in silicon photonics. This is particularly true for nonlinear optical devices in which the high intensity light required for nonlinear interactions renders TPA inevitable. Unless steps are taken to reduce the effective free carrier lifetime, the <b>secondary</b> <b>absorption</b> by free carriers that are generated in the process causes significant loss of optical power. One technique for mitigating this problem {{is the use of}} a reverse-biased diode to sweep out the carriers. Using this approach, continuous-wave (CW) Raman amplification and lasing has been successfully demonstrated [1]. However, the carrier removal has been achieved at the expense of significant electrical power dissipation. At the same time, power dissipation in silicon VLSI is the central threat to the continued advance of the technology as described by the Moore’s law [2]. The power dissipation of silicon photonic devices is therefore of paramount importance {{if they are to be}} compatible with CMOS VLSI technology. We have recently shown that TPA in silicon Raman devices can be turned into an advantage because it results in a two-photon photovoltaic effect.

Leaf and canopy reflectance of Phaseolus vulgaris was obtained using an ASD FieldSpec Hi-Res spectroradiometer, as well as soil spectral data.

The fundamental factors that promote an extended absorption are here determined for three prototype D-A 1 -D-A 2 systems {{through a combination of}} experimental and computational methods. Systematic quantum chemical calculations are then used to reveal the intrinsic optical properties of ten further D-A 1 -D-A 2 polymer candidates. These investigated polymers are all predicted to exhibit intense primary absorption peaks at 615 - 954 nm, corresponding to charge-transfer (CT) transitions to the stronger acceptor, as well as <b>secondary</b> <b>absorption</b> features at 444 - 647 nm that originate from CT transitions to the weaker acceptors.

Analytical control of the starting materials is a basic requirement to know the concentration of heavy metals, which are potential initiators of autocatalytic reactions. Seven activated charcoal and two carbon black samples have been analyzed regarding their content of seven elements, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni and V using direct solid sampling high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace AAS (SS-HR-CS GF AAS) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) after microwave-assisted acidic digestion as a reference method. The limits of detection of the former technique are 1 – 2 orders of magnitude {{lower than those of}} ICP OES and comparable to those of more sophisticated techniques. For iron the working range of HR-CS GF AAS has been expanded by simultaneous measurement at two <b>secondary</b> <b>absorption</b> lines (344, 099 nm and 344, 399 nm). Partial least-squares regression between measured and calculated temperatures for beginning exothermicity (Ton) has been used to investigate the prediction capability of the investigated techniques. Whereas the ICP OES measurements for seven elements resulted in an error of prediction of 3. 67 %, the results obtained by SS-HR-CS GF AAS exhibited a correlation coefficient of 0. 99 and an error of prediction of only 0. 68 %. Acceptable correlation has been obtained with the latter technique measuring only three to four elements...|$|E
40|$|We {{identify}} HS 2325 + 8205 as an eclipsing, frequently outbursting dwarf nova with an {{orbital period}} of 279. 841731 (5) min. Spectroscopic observations {{are used to}} derive the radial velocity curve of the <b>secondary</b> star from <b>absorption</b> features and also from the H-alpha emission lines, originating from the accretion disc, yielding K_secondary = K_abs = 237 +- 28 km/s and K_emn = 145 +- 9 km/s respectively. The distance to the system is calculated to be 400 (+ 200, - 140) pc. A photometric monitoring campaign reveals an outburst recurrence time of 12 - 14 d, The combination of magnitude range (17 - 14 mag), high declination, eclipsing nature and frequency of outbursts makes HS 2325 + 8205 the ideal system for "real-time" studies of the accretion disc evolution and behavior in dwarf nova outbursts.

40|$|The {{levels of}} A, H, I, and i plasma antigens and of anti-B, anti-I, and anti-T {{antibodies}} were measured in 70 subjects with colonic or gastric carcinoma. These studies {{showed a significant}} increase in A plasma activity of the A subjects, and in H plasma activity of the O subjects, while 25 % of the tested subjects showed increased I plasma activity. There was no difference in i plasma activity between cancer patients and healthy subjects. These results take into account the marked polymorphism acquired by neoplastic tissue, which is capable also of producing a greater quantity of antigens than that of healthy subjects. Nevertheless this heterogeneity forms a barrier to the clinical measurement of these plasma antigens for screening neoplasms. The significant fall in the amount of anti-T antibodies seemed to be <b>secondary</b> to the <b>absorption</b> of these antibodies {{on the surface of the}} tumour cells...|$|R
40|$|Subtherapeutic {{tacrolimus}} trough {{concentrations were}} {{noted in a}} 52 -year-old woman who had undergone liver transplantation. Her tacrolimus dosage was increased from 7 to 28 mg twice/day, and ketoconazole therapy was added; however, her tacrolimus concentration remained undetectable. Metoclopramide 10 mg 4 times/day was begun to control the patient’s new-onset nausea and vomiting. Within 48 hours of increasing the dosage to 20 mg 4 times/day, her tacrolimus trough concentration exceeded 30 ng/ml. Signs and symptoms were suggestive of tacrolimus nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. According to the Naranjo scale, this adverse drug event was probably the result of improved <b>absorption</b> of tacrolimus <b>secondary</b> to metoclopramide therapy. The patient’s subtherapeutic tacrolimus concentration at baseline was probably <b>secondary</b> to poor <b>absorption</b> due to impaired gastric emptying. Coadministration of metoclopramide significantly improved gastric motility and delivery of tacrolimus to the small intestine, increasing tacrolimus bioavailability, thus resulting in acute-onset tacrolimu...|$|R
