5000|$|The Blackhope Burn joins Moffat Water {{close to}} a farm called Capplegill (OS. Ref. NT147098) on the A708. Just to the north east of Capplegill (roughly 150 metres) {{there is room for}} a car or two to park by Blackshope house. The classic walk from here is to head north from where you are parked passing through a field where there are usually Belted Galloways to be seen, and up onto <b>Saddle</b> <b>Yoke</b> which as the name implies has two tops with a short saddle between them. These tops are <b>Saddle</b> <b>Yoke</b> (just over 630 metres high [...] ) and Under <b>Saddle</b> <b>Yoke</b> (745 metres. [...] From there descend to the water course in Whirly Gill before {{climbing}} to the top of Saddle Craigs {{at the head of the}} Blackhope Glen and just below Hartfell Rig (739 metres). An alternative to this is to go up onto the rig itself but that would be to miss the views from the top of the crags that are Saddle Craigs. Now climb to the summit of Hartfell (808 metres) and then follow the ridge from there back to Capplegill going over Swatte Fell (729 metres) en route. In other words, this route goes up one side of the hills above Blackhope Glen and back down the other. The crags on this return leg are quite spectacular (particularly around Hound Shoulder) with views over the glen to <b>Saddle</b> <b>Yoke</b> then Carrifran Gans (757 metres) and White Coomb (821 metres and the highest hill in the Moffat hills) beyond. Capplegill is also a useful access point to the Ettrick Hills which lie south of Moffatdale.|$|E

50|$|During {{this film}} Dyer visits Poland, {{a country which}} has been <b>saddled</b> with the <b>yoke</b> of oppression {{throughout}} its history. At {{the beginning of his}} journey, he heads to Gdańsk where he meets Lechias supporters Chuligani Wolnego Miasta - a firm that helped to abolish the communist regime. He then travels on to Kraków to sample the The Holy War (pol. Święta Wojna) - the Kraków derby between Cracovia and Wisła. First he meets one of Cracovia hooligans groups - Anty Wisła, later he meets Sharks (main of Wisłas hooligans firm). On October 28, 2006, Danny experienced what The Holy War really is.|$|R
25|$|The chariot {{and horse}} were {{introduced}} to Egypt by the Hyksos invaders in the 16th century BCE and undoubtedly contributed to the military success of the Egyptians. In the remains of Egyptian and Assyrian art, there are numerous representations of chariots, which display rich ornamentation. The chariots of the Egyptians and Assyrians, with whom the bow was the principal arm of attack, were richly mounted with quivers full of arrows. The Egyptians invented the <b>yoke</b> <b>saddle</b> for their chariot horses in c. 1500 BCE. The best preserved examples of Egyptian chariots are the four specimens from the tomb of Tutankhamun. Chariots can be carried by two or more horses.|$|R

50|$|The {{principal}} mountains occur {{near the}} northern boundaries, the highest being White Coomb (2695 ft), Hart Fell (2651 ft), <b>Saddle</b> <b>Yoke</b> (2412 ft), Swatte Fell (2389 ft), Lowther Hills (2377 ft), Queensberry (hill) (2285 ft) - which gives his secondary {{title to the}} Duke of Buccleuch and the title of Marquess to {{a branch of the}} house of Douglas - and Ettrick Pen (2269 ft).|$|E
5000|$|There is parking {{associated}} with Carrifran Wildwood project at OS Ref NT163117 {{which can be}} used for this route. It is a steep climb from there to the top of Carrifran Gans (nearly 670 metres in 2 kilometres). [...] From there it is possible to either take in White Coomb and Firthhope Rig (800 metres) in the next stage or, descend to the more interesting waterfalls around Firthhope Burn - White Coomb can be saved for the Grey Mare's Tail routes. Around the waterfalls offers the best views and also some quite interesting terrain to scramble over - not only around the waterfalls themselves but also while crossing the face of the steep lower slopes of Firthhope Rig on the way up to Games Castle (a natural feature resembling a castle) and Rotten Bottom (the sump area for all the peat hags round about). Now the route heads {{along the top of the}} crags of Raven Craig and Priest Craig (i.e. around the top of Carrifran Glen) and towards <b>Saddle</b> <b>Yoke</b> from where it makes its way down to where the car is parked. Here again the route goes up one side of a glen (Carrifran Glen) and back the other, along the tops above the glen.|$|E
5000|$|Archaeologist Joost Crouwel {{writes that}} [...] "Chariots were not sudden inventions, but {{developed}} out of earlier vehicles that were mounted on disk or cross-bar wheels. This development {{can best be}} traced in the Near East, where spoke-wheeled and horse-drawn ‘true’ chariots are first attested in the earlier part of the second millennium BC...". [...] The early usage of chariots was mainly for transportation purposes. With technological improvements to their structure (such as a “cross-bar” form of wheel construction to reduce the vehicle's weight), the use of chariots for military purposes began. The Egyptians invented the <b>yoke</b> <b>saddle</b> for their chariot horses around 1500 BC. Chariots were effective for their high speed, mobility and strength {{which could not be}} matched by infantry at the time. They quickly became a powerful new weapon across the ancient Near East. The best preserved examples of Egyptian chariots are the six specimens from the tomb of Tutankhamun.|$|R
