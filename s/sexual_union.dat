5|$|Raëlians {{believe that}} {{throughout}} the ages, members of the Elohim civilization sent different prophets, including Moses, Jesus, Buddha and many others whose role was to guide humanity and to prepare humans for the future, {{all of whom were}} created {{as a result of a}} <b>sexual</b> <b>union</b> between a human woman and one of the Elohim. To Raëlians, this was possible because the Elohim had advanced DNA synthesis and genetic engineering. The Elohim later reduced the frequent visits so that humans were largely left to progress on their own, until the time of the Apocalypse/Revelation when they would send their final messenger and disclose themselves at an extraterrestrial embassy, establishing political and economic ties.|$|E
25|$|The sexual {{purity of}} a male prophet is not at issue, but sexual {{activity}} renders a woman unfit. The implication of <b>sexual</b> <b>union</b> between the god and a mortal woman is again viewed as a dangerous deception.|$|E
25|$|The Kaula {{sacrifice}} {{is reserved for}} the few, the elite who can maintain a state of Bhairava (spiritual illumination) in <b>sexual</b> <b>union.</b> Other couples, even if they reproduce the ritual to the letter (as perceived from outside), {{if they do not}} attain Bhairava consciousness, are merely engaging in a sexual act.|$|E
50|$|The other highly {{significant}} legal aspect associated with kinship relations is of <b>sexual</b> <b>unions</b> and reproduction. Inheritance {{seems to have}} been passed on primarily in the paternal line, as such, clarifying the relations between partners, who probably quite frequently were members of different kin-groups, as well as their children, must have been quite essential. The surprisingly close parallels between the early medieval Irish and Welsh laws where <b>sexual</b> <b>unions</b> are concerned, and the similarity between the most prestigious union described in them with the Gaulish marriage as described by Caesar, indicate that the treatment of different <b>sexual</b> <b>unions</b> was quite similar over wide areas of western Europe from late prehistory well into the medieval period.|$|R
25|$|The Coloured {{community}} is predominantly descended from numerous interracial <b>sexual</b> <b>unions,</b> primarily between Western European men and Khoisan {{women in the}} Cape Colony from the 17th century onwards.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} Mosuo {{family and}} kinship affords women an equality and agency over their sexual and procreative lives that {{is rare in}} most cultures. Romantic and <b>sexual</b> <b>unions</b> are governed solely by the woman and man involved. Other family members are unconcerned with the romantic lives of their offspring.|$|R
25|$|Group practices, {{which are}} {{restricted}} {{to the members of}} a kaula (family), include rituals, festivities, initiations and the secretive tantric <b>sexual</b> <b>union.</b> The purposes of this practice are the initiation of novices, the expansion of consciousness and expression of the bliss already attained as participants become more and more advanced.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the laws}} commented {{on how the}} king was to arrange his life and {{holdings}} and how many individuals should be in his retinue. In particular, Críth Gablach gives a highly schematised and unrealistic account of how the king spends his week: Sunday is for drinking ale, Monday is for judging, Tuesday is for playing fidchell, Wednesday is for watching hounds hunt, Thursday is for <b>sexual</b> <b>union,</b> Friday is for racing horses, and Saturday is for judging (a different word from Monday, but the distinction is unclear).|$|E
500|$|Fornication is the <b>sexual</b> <b>union</b> of an {{unmarried}} man and {{an unmarried}} woman. This is considered contrary to [...] "the dignity of persons and of human sexuality" [...] {{because it is}} not ordered to the [...] "good of spouses" [...] or the [...] "generation and education of children." ...|$|E
5000|$|In English, an [...] "interracial marriage" [...] {{refers to}} the {{institution}} of marriage, including childless marriages. Formerly, the term was used more widely as a euphemism for interracial <b>sexual</b> <b>unions</b> that produced mixed-race offspring out of wedlock, since both miscegenation and illegitimacy were historically taboo in Western culture, particularly {{in the context of}} Victorian morality.|$|R
50|$|There was {{a veritable}} {{explosion}} of defenses of Creole ancestry. The more novelist George Washington Cable engaged his characters in family feuds over inheritance, embroiled them in <b>sexual</b> <b>unions</b> with blacks and mulattoes, {{and made them}} seem particularly defensive about their presumably pure Caucasian ancestry, the more vociferously the white Creoles responded, insisting on purity of white ancestry as a requirement for identification as Creole.|$|R
5000|$|In 1950s (and later) South Africa the [...] "brown people" [...] {{were the}} Coloreds, {{referring}} to those born of black-white <b>sexual</b> <b>unions</b> out of wedlock. The Afrikaans terms, which incorporate many subtleties of heritage, political agenda, and identity, are [...] "" [...] ("brown"), [...] "" [...] ("browns"), and [...] "" [...] ("brown people"). Some South Africans prefer the appellation [...] "bruinmense" [...] to [...] "Colored".|$|R
500|$|Adultery is the <b>sexual</b> <b>union</b> {{of a man}} {{and woman}} where at least one is married to someone else. It {{is for this reason that}} the Church {{considers}} it a greater sin than fornication. Kreeft states, [...] "The adulterer sins against his spouse, his society, and his children as well as his own body and soul." ...|$|E
500|$|When he {{is about}} 30, Widmerpool becomes engaged to a {{considerably}} older widow, Mildred Haycock. His main motivation appears to be his craving for social status; she {{is the daughter of}} Lord Vowchurch. In his analysis of Powell's works, Nicholas Birns wrote: [...] "What Widmerpool wants to do is to 'marry up', to make a marriage that will cement his upward social mobility, and he is willing to take an older woman with two teenage children in order to accomplish this." [...] The engagement ends abruptly, over Widmerpool's impotence during an attempted premarital <b>sexual</b> <b>union.</b>|$|E
500|$|In Tantra, the Mahavidya goddess Chhinnamasta is {{depicted}} severing her own head and {{standing on the}} copulating couple of Kama and Rati, with the latter on top, (viparita-rati sex position). The woman-on-top position suggests female dominance over male. Chhinnamasta standing on a copulating couple of Kama and Rati is interpreted {{by some as a}} symbol of self-control [...] of sexual desire, while others interpret it as the goddess, being an embodiment of sexual energy. Images of Chhinnamasta depicted sitting on Kamadeva-Rati [...] in a non-suppressive fashion are associated with the latter interpretation. The love-deity couple also symbolize maithuna, ritual <b>sexual</b> <b>union.</b>|$|E

500|$|Kennings in the skaldic corpus {{for female}} jötnar have been {{identified}} (such as [...] "desired woman of Máni" [...] used by the 10th century skald Guthormr sindri) as pointing to a potential marriage or <b>sexual</b> <b>union</b> between Máni and a female jötunn. John Lindow states that if a story about Máni having such {{a relationship with a}} female jötunn existed, then [...] "it has left no other trace in the extant mythology. Rudolf Simek states that in two skaldic kennings [...] "Máni is apparently a gigantic being in a myth of which we otherwise know nothing".|$|E
500|$|Fortune was {{particularly}} {{concerned with the}} issue of sex. In her early works she displayed a prudish attitude regarding sexuality, warning her readers about the perceived perils of masturbation, extra-marital sex, same-sex sexual activity, abortion, and free love. The only form of sexual expression that she considered appropriate was that between a heterosexual married couple, and she promoted a form of 'psychic masturbation' to quell any sexual urges that a celibate individual may have. According to Richardson, she was [...] "a prude, at least by today's standards". In her later works she exhibited a more positive attitude toward sexuality, describing the <b>sexual</b> <b>union</b> between a man and woman as the most powerful expression of a [...] "life-force" [...] which flows throughout the universe. She believed that this erotic attraction between men and women could be harnessed for use in magic. She urged her followers to be naked under their robes when carrying out magical rituals, for this would increase the creative sexual tension between the men and women present. Although sex features in her novels, it is never described in graphic detail. Nevertheless, her later occult novels entail depictions of heterosexual sex outside of marriage, suggesting that by this point Fortune no longer believed that sex must be restrained to wedlock.|$|E

50|$|The sexual {{imbalance}} in the Chinese community with {{the preponderance of}} men and scarcity of women led to fears among white Australians over white women engaging in <b>sexual</b> <b>unions</b> with Chinese men since Chinese opium dens in towns and cities were visited by white women prostitutes and some Chinese men married white women and {{this led to the}} Victoria Buckland River and New South Wales Back Creek riots.|$|R
5000|$|According to Alfredo Sachettí, low-class Peruvians, {{including}} some black and Indian women, {{were the ones}} who established <b>sexual</b> <b>unions</b> or marriages with the Chinese men, [...] He claimed this mixing was causing the Chinese to suffer from [...] "progressive degeneration."

2500|$|In Mahayana Buddhism, Bodhisattvas such as Tara and Guanyin {{are very}} popular female deities. Some Buddhist Tantric texts include female consorts for each heavenly Buddha or Bodhisattva. In these Tantric couples, the female symbolizes wisdom (prajna) {{and the male}} symbolizes {{skillful}} means (upaya). [...] The union of these two qualities is often depicted as <b>sexual</b> <b>union,</b> known as yab-yum (father-mother).|$|E
2500|$|With the Romantics of {{the early}} 19th century, the subject of [...] "keeping" [...] becomes more problematic, in that a non-marital <b>sexual</b> <b>union</b> can {{occasionally}} be celebrated as a woman's free choice and a noble alternative. Maryann Evans (better known as George Eliot) defiantly lived [...] "in sin" [...] with a married man, partially {{as a sign of}} her independence of middle-class morality.

50|$|As noted above, {{several kinds}} of same-gendered, non-sexual marriages exist in some lineage-based societies; this section relates to same-gendered <b>sexual</b> <b>unions.</b> Some {{cultures}} include third gender (two-spirit or transgender) individuals, such as the berdache of the Zuni in New Mexico. We'wha, {{one of the most}} revered Zuni elders (an Ihamana, spiritual leader) served as an emissary of the Zuni to Washington, where he met President Grover Cleveland. We'wha had a husband who was generally recognized as such.|$|R
5000|$|Mermaids (and {{their male}} counterparts) exist within the Anitaverse. Merfolk {{with a power}} similar to the ardeur are known as sirens who seductively lure men into inhumanly strange but {{intensely}} pleasurable <b>sexual</b> <b>unions,</b> only to drown or kill them in some other way. Sirens {{have the power to}} [...] "roll" [...] the minds of people in a similar fashion to vampires. Due to their potential power over other merfolk, sirens are traditionally slain by merfolk before they can become a danger.|$|R
40|$|Incest' {{refers to}} illegal sexual {{relations}} between family members. Its precise contours, however, are culturally specific. Hence, an illegal incestuous union in one social context {{may be a}} legal close-kin union in another. First-degree <b>sexual</b> <b>unions,</b> between a parent and child, or between siblings, are most widely prohibited and abhorred. This book discusses all overt and covert first-degree incest relations in the Hebrew Bible and also probes the significance of gaps and what these imply about projected sexual and social values. As the dominant opinion {{on the origin of}} first-degree incest continues to be shaped, new voices such as those of queer and post-feminist criticism have joined the conversation. It navigates not only the incest laws of Leviticus and the narratives of Lot and his daughters and of Amnon and Tamar but pursues subtler intimations of first-degree <b>sexual</b> <b>unions,</b> such as between Adam and his (absent but arguably implied) mother, Haran and Terah's wife, Ham and Noah. In pursuing the psycho-social values that may be drawn from the Hebrew Bible regarding first-degree incest, this book will provide a thorough review of incest studies from the early 20 th century onward and explain and assess the contribution of very recent critical approaches from queer and post-feminist perspectives...|$|R
2500|$|The Catechism of the Catholic Church {{claims that}} Natural law teaches that {{reproduction}} has an [...] "inseparable connection" [...] to <b>sexual</b> <b>union</b> of married couples. In addition, the church opposes IVF {{because it might}} cause disposal of embryos; in Catholicism, an embryo is viewed as an individual with a soul that must {{be treated as a}} person. The Catholic Church maintains that it is not objectively evil to be infertile, and advocates adoption as an option for such couples who still wish to have children.|$|E
2500|$|Hevajra Tantra states ‘You should kill living beings, speak lying words, {{take what}} is not given, consort with the women of others’. [...] While some of these {{statements}} were taken literally as part of ritual practice, others such as killing was interpreted in a metaphorical sense. In the Hevajra, [...] "killing" [...] is defined as developing concentration by killing the life-breath of discursive thoughts. Likewise, while actual <b>sexual</b> <b>union</b> with a physical consort is practiced, it is also common to use a visualized mental consort.|$|E
2500|$|Parvati and Shiva {{are often}} symbolized by a yoni and a linga respectively. In ancient literature, yoni means womb {{and place of}} gestation, the yoni-linga metaphor {{represents}} [...] "origin, source or regenerative power". The linga-yoni icon is widespread, found in Shaivite Hindu temples of South Asia and Southeast Asia. Often called Shivalinga, it almost always has both linga and the yoni. The icon represents the interdependence and union of feminine and masculine energies in recreation and regeneration of all life. In some depictions, Parvati and Shiva are shown in various forms of <b>sexual</b> <b>union.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} {{of white men}} having <b>sexual</b> <b>unions</b> with slave women was obvious in the many mixed-race children who were born into slavery and part of many households. In some areas, such mixed-race families became the core of domestic and household servants, as at Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. Both his father-in-law and he took mixed-race slave women as concubines after being widowed; each man had six children by his slave. Jefferson's young concubine, Sally Hemings, was 3/4 white, the daughter of his father-in-law John Wayles and the half-sister of his late wife.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th to early 20th century, Chinese men in Mauritius married Indian women due to both {{a lack of}} Chinese women and the higher numbers of Indian women on the island. At first the {{prospect}} of relations with Indian women was unappealing to the original all male Chinese migrants yet they eventually had to establish <b>sexual</b> <b>unions</b> with Indian women since there were no Chinese women arriving in the country. The 1921 census in Mauritius counted that Indian women there had a total of 148 children fathered by Chinese men. These Chinese were mostly traders.|$|R
50|$|According to Erikson, in {{the wake}} of the {{adolescent}} emphasis upon identity formation, 'the young adult, emerging from the search for and insistence on identity, is eager and willing to fuse their identity with that of others. He she is ready for intimacy, that is, the capacity to commit... to concrete affiliations and partnerships.' To do so means the ability 'to face the fear of ego loss in situations which call for self-abandon: in the solidarity of close affiliations, in orgasms and <b>sexual</b> <b>unions,</b> in close friendships and in physical combat'. Avoidance of such experiences 'because of a fear of ego-loss may lead to a deep sense of isolation and consequent self-absorption'.|$|R
