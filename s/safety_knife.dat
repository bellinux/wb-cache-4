50|$|Some kite designs {{from late}} 2005 and onwards have {{included}} immediate and almost full depower {{integrated with the}} control bar and improved quick release mechanisms, {{both of which are}} making the sport much safer. However, lack of sufficient practice of emergency depowering the kite and going out in excessively strong or unstable weather can reduce the benefit of high depower kites. A <b>safety</b> <b>knife</b> is useful if lines become tangled and dangerous.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>safety</b> hook <b>knife</b> is {{considered}} required equipment. The corrosion resistant stainless steel blade is partially {{protected by a}} curved plastic hook. It {{can be used to}} cut entangled or snagged kite lines, or to release the kite if the safety release system fails. Some kitesurfing harnesses are equipped with a small pocket for the knife.|$|R
50|$|In 1906-07, Schrade {{patented}} the <b>Safety</b> Pushbutton <b>Knives,</b> {{an improved}} series of switchblade knives with side-mounted operating button and a sliding safety switch. Later developed in slightly modified form as the Presto series, the Schrade switchblade {{would come to}} dominate the automatic knife market in the United States for the next fifty-five years. In the 1920s, Schrade bought the defunct Walden Cutlery Company {{in order to obtain}} their stocks of handle material for his knives.|$|R
50|$|The Lake and Walker <b>Knife</b> <b>Safety</b> system (LAWKS) is a {{patented}} {{addition to}} folding knives using the Walker Linerlock, designed by noted Knifemakers' Guild members Ron Lake and Michael Walker. The safety comes in two versions: original LAWKS and the Columbia River Knife & Tool company's patented AutoLAWKS. These additions raise manufacturing and engineering costs, but increase safety and security.|$|R
5000|$|In 1908, Waterman began {{marketing}} {{a popular}} safety pen of its own. For pens with non-retractable nibs, {{the adoption of}} screw-on caps with inner caps that sealed around the nib by bearing against {{the front of the}} section effectively solved the leakage problem (such pens were also marketed as [...] "safety pens", as with the Parker Jack <b>Knife</b> <b>Safety</b> and the Swan Safety Screw-Cap).|$|R
50|$|Having {{earned a}} {{handsome}} return from his work, Schrade traveled to Europe in 1911, first to Sheffield, England, where he assisted Thomas Turner & Company in expediting a wartime {{order from the}} British Navy. He next moved to the knifemaking center of Solingen, Germany. Schrade was fully aware of Solingen's reputation for having the best cutlery steel in Europe, and he opened a factory to produce his <b>safety</b> pushbutton switchblade <b>knife</b> there. In 1915 or 1916 Schrade sold his Solingen holdings (some sources state they were seized by the German government) {{and returned to the}} United States.|$|R
50|$|In 1904, in {{combination}} with his brothers Louis and William, George Schrade formed the Schrade Cutlery Co. in Walden, and began developing {{a new series of}} switchblades, which he patented in 1906-07. Schrade's new <b>Safety</b> Pushbutton <b>Knives</b> incorporated several design improvements over his earlier work, and featured a handle-mounted operating button with a sliding safety switch. A multi-blade operating button allowed the knife to operate with up to four automatic blades. In successive patents from 1906 through 1916 Schrade would steadily improve this design, which would later become known as the Presto series. With the Presto line, Schrade would largely dominate the automatic knife market in the United States for the next forty years. Schrade would go on to manufacture thousands of contract switchblade knives under several trademarks and brands, including E. Weck, Wade & Butcher, and Case XX, while other companies used Schrade's patent as the basis for their own switchblade patterns. Among these were pocket and folding hunter pattern switchblades bearing the name Keen Kutter, a trademark owned by E.C. Simmons Hardware Co. (later purchased by the Shapleigh Hardware Co.).|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} seals {{is used to}} close bags. Each seal has {{advantages}} and disadvantages. For shop assistants sealing bags could be a repetitive physically demanding action. Opening and closing the bags again can cause some discomfort or annoyance for consumers. Besides, it is an activity which can endanger <b>safety,</b> i. e., <b>knives</b> being used in opening, children swallowing the systems of sealing. To prevent these problems a new sealing system was developed. In this paper the opinion of shop assistants, consumers and experts on several bag sealing systems was studied.

40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} the efficacy and <b>safety</b> of gamma <b>knife</b> radiosurgery (GKS) in treating temporal lobe epilepsy, GKS {{was performed in}} four adult patients with recurrent complex partial seizures who underwent incomplete anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) but were reluctant to undergo a second resective surgery. A marginal dose of 24. 5 – 25 Gy, corresponding to 65 – 70 % isodose curve, was delivered to the treatment target that included the residual amygdala and the head and anterior body of the hippocampus. None of the patients had severe acute side effects but three patients had radiation-induced MRI signal changes around the target volume 13, 20, and 24 months after GKS, respectively. All four patients had significant seizure reduction during the first 6 -month period and clinical efficacy persisted throughout the 2 -year follow-up period. All of the patients also had improved neuropsychological profiles, including memory function and quality-of-life, compared to their pre-GKS conditions. In conclusion, the safety and clinical efficacy of GKS make it a reasonable and suitable therapeutic alternative for patients with recurrent seizures after incomplete ATL. A higher marginal dose of > 25 Gy and wider coverage may be more clinically beneficial but warrant further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Object. This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} efficacy and <b>safety</b> of gamma <b>knife</b> radiosurgery (GKS) {{for the treatment of}} arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located within the brainstem. Methods. The results of GKS performed in 87 patients with brainstem AVMs at two centers with experienced physicians are reviewed. The mean patient age was 37 years and the population included 19 children. The male/female ratio was 56 : 31. The malformation was located in the upper brainstem in 52 patients. Seventy-four percent of the patients had suffered a hemorrhage before GKS. For 70 % of the patients no other treatment had been proposed before GKS. The mean AVM volume was 1. 3 cm 3. The lesions were treated with one to eight isocenters, with a margin dose ranging between 11. 5 Gy and 30 Gy. The mean clinical follow-up period was 3. 2 years. Ninety-five percent of the patients improved or remained neurologically stable. Rebleeding occurred in three patients at 3, 6, and 16 months, respectively, after GKS. Two patients in whom rebleeding occured recovered, and one died. The AVM obliteration rate was 63 % at 2 years and 73 % at 3 years after GKS. A second GKS was performed in six patients in whom only partial obliteration was demonstrated on angiography 3 years after the first procedure. Conclusions. Gamma knife radiosurgery may be a valuable first-choice therapy for the treatment of AVMs located within the brainstem. SCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
