40|$|This thesis investigates a Chilean urban {{agriculture}} {{project that}} has been underway {{for more than twenty}} years in Tome, a small coastal town located near the regional capital of Concepcion. Initiated in the early 1980 s by the Chilean non-governmental organization, CET SUR, the program works on themes of food security and poverty alleviation, environmental issues and women's leadership development. In 1999, this project began to replicate the Tome experience to seven additional towns in and around the Greater Concepcion area with a new initiative entitled the Toward <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Cities</b> <b>Project.</b> Similar urban agriculture programs began at the same time in Santiago, but only remnants of those projects remain: a program for seniors here, a demonstration garden at the environment center there. The project in Tome, instead of shrinking as economic conditions improved from the crisis of the early 1980 s, has recently spread to seven additional towns. This puzzle forms the crux of my research: what are some of the factors that may explain why this project has achieved this longevity and managed to grow its program, while similar programs in Chile have long since vanished? The investigation identifies two sets of factors that distinguish the Toward <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Cities</b> <b>Project</b> from other urban agriculture programs. The first is the high level of dedication to the job of its frontline workers. CET SUR motivates these workers in several ways: offering them opportunities to develop their personal skills, as well as granting them substantial discretion in decisionmaking. The second factor that contributes to the project's relative success is the myriad networks CET SUR has developed with government. CET SUR has developed these networks by linking program objectives with political realities such as the need of local elected officials to deliver concrete and/or visible benefits to constituents and maintain a high public profile. by Maggie Scott.

40|$|The rise {{in demand}} for car travel is fuelled more by the {{increased}} spatial separation of homes and workplaces, shops and schools than by any rise in trip making. Belfast {{is one of the}} most car dependent cities in the United Kingdom. A major household survey was intended to inform an understanding of the likely behavioural response to sustainable development policy initiatives. The survey was one of a series of linked tools within a wider EPSRC <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Cities</b> <b>Project</b> research project. Insights into consumer responses to the various policy measures considered in the overall project were drawn in part from the stated preference experiments included in the household survey. Initiatives included improved domestic energy efficiency, increased densification of housing, improved public transport and the introduction of traffic restraint measures such as road user charges. There were signs of some willingness to accept moderately higher densities on the basis that residents would be compensated by a lower than otherwise purchase price. The typical effect of introducing road pricing say at £ 1. 00 per day equated to a reduction in property values of some 2. 5 % while the absence of any apparent statistical significance generated by the public transport variable reflects its current lack of credibility as an alternative to the car. While Belfast may not be wholly typical, it does offer a warning of the extent of the challenge faced by policy makers in more car dominated cities in the UK and beyond...|$|E

To analyze this discrepancy, I have identified a common theory-practice gap in the form of the three pitfalls of <b>sustainable</b> <b>city,</b> which bring about economic and ethical conflicts and risks creating socio-spatial utopias. The three pitfalls are: (1) the idea of the city as a business; (2) the oversimplification of urban complexity; (3) the quest for the ideal community. This conceptual framework has two purposes. First, it helps to systematize the existing literature on the <b>sustainable</b> <b>city</b> <b>project,</b> focusing on few selected issues. Second, it offers a project evaluation framework, useful both for the management of resources and for the planning of urban space.

This chapters provides comparative perspectives on four recent national <b>sustainable</b> <b>city</b> programmes from France, India, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The analysis reveals two key insights: first, national policy is found to exercise a strong shaping role in what sustainable development for future cities is understood to be, which helps explain the considerable differences in priorities and approaches across countries. Second, beyond articulating strategic priorities, national policy may exercise a ‘soft’ governance function by incentivising and facilitating wider, voluntary governance networks in the effort to implement <b>sustainable</b> <b>city</b> <b>projects</b> locally.

In {{order for the}} region to become more economically resilient and environmentally sustainable, alternative transportation methods must be considered. One such alternative that has shown great promise in {{other regions of the}} United States is rail transport. Rail transport, including commuter rail or high speed rail, has proven to not only be an effective alternative to automobile transport, but also as a more environmentally sustainable transportation option.

The most prevalent forms of pervasive computing in relation to the urban domain are UbiComp, AmI, the IoT, and SenComp [6].

40|$|A {{new wave}} of smart <b>cities</b> <b>projects</b> is {{underway}} that proposes to deploy sensor-based ubiquitous computing across urban infrastructures and mobile devices to achieve greater sustainability. But in what ways do these smart and <b>sustainable</b> <b>cities</b> give rise to distinct material-political arrangements and practices that potentially delimit urban “citizenship” {{to a series of}} actions focused on monitoring and managing data? And {{what are the implications of}} computationally organized distributions of environmental governance that are programmed for distinct functionalities, and are managed by corporate and state actors that engage with cities as datasets to be manipulated? Working through an early and formative smart cities design proposal, the Connected <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Cities</b> (CSC) <b>project,</b> developed by MIT and Cisco within the Connected Urban Development initiative from 2007 to 2008, this paper discusses the ways in which smart city proposals might be understood through processes of environmentality, or the distribution of governance within and through environments and environmental technologies. Revisiting and reworking Foucault’s notion of environmentality in the context of the CSC smart cities design proposal, this paper advances an approach to environmentality that deals not with the production of environmental subjects, but rather attends to the specific spatial-material distribution and relationality of power through environments, technologies and ways of life. By updating and advancing environmentality through a discussion of computational urbanisms, this paper considers how practices and operations of citizenship emerge that are a critical part of the imaginings of smart and <b>sustainable</b> <b>cities.</b> This re-versioning of environmentality through the smart city recasts who or what counts as a “citizen,” and attends to the ways in which citizenship is articulated environmentally through the distribution and feedback of monitoring and urban data practices, rather than through governable subjects or populations...|$|R

40|$|Cities are key {{locations}} where Sustainability {{needs to be}} addressed at all levels, as land is a finite resource. However, not all urban spaces are exploited at best, and land developers often evaluate unused, misused, or poorly-designed urban portions as impracticable constraints. Further, public authorities lose the challenge to enable and turn these urban spaces into valuable opportunities where Sustainable Urban Development may flourish. Arguing that these spatial elements are at the centre of SUD, the paper elaborates a prototype {{in the form of a}} conceptual strategic planning framework, committed to an effective recycling of the city spaces using a flexible and multidisciplinary approach. Firstly, the research focuses upon a broad review of Sustainability literature, highlighting established principles and guidelines, building a sound theoretical base for the new concept. Hence, it investigates origins, identifies and congruently suggests a definition, characterisation and classification for urban “R-Spaces”. Secondly, formal, informal and temporary fitting functions are analysed and inserted into a portfolio meant to enhance adaptability and enlarge the choices for the on-site interventions. Thirdly, the study outlines ideal quality requirements for a sustainable planning process.

The analysis of the City of San Francisco's Residential Energy Conservation Ordinance (RECO) showed that a limited, prescriptive energy conservation ordinance for existing residential construction can be enforced relatively easily with little administrative costs, and that compliance with such ordinances can be quite high. Compliance with the code was facilitated by extensive publicity, an informed public concerned {{with the cost of}} energy and knowledgeable about energy efficiency, the threat of punishment (Order of Abatement), the use of private inspectors, and training workshops for City and private inspectors. The analysis of California's Title 24 Standards for new residential and commercial construction showed that enforcement of this type of code for many climate zones is more complex and requires extensive administrative support for education and training of inspectors, architects, engineers, and builders. Under this code, prescriptive and performance approaches for compliance are permitted, resulting in the demand for alternative methods of enforcement: {{technical assistance}}, plan review, field inspection, and computer analysis. In contrast to existing construction, building design and new materials and construction practices are of critical importance in new construction, creating a need for extensive technical assistance and extensive interaction between enforcement personnel and the building community. Compliance problems associated with building design and installation did occur in both residential and nonresidential buildings. Because statewide codes are enforced by local officials, these problems may increase over time as energy standards change and become more complex and as other standards (eg, health and safety codes) remain a higher priority. The California Energy Commission realizes that code enforcement by itself is insufficient and expects that additional educational and technical assistance efforts (eg, manuals, training programs, and toll-free telephone lines) will ameliorate these problems...|$|R

50|$|A glimpse on {{the history}} of green urbanism of US as found in Karlenzig, et al. ‘How Green is Your City’ book (2007, 06-07). The concept had a gradual start in the late 1800s, when some large cities of United States (US) started using {{advanced}} drinking water, sewage and sanitary systems. Consecutively, public parks and open spaces were implemented in New York City. At the end of the World War II, the US government offered its citizens affordable housing in easy loan to boost up city population and also introduced a new federal Interstate System, combined with a rise of automobile ownership, gave away to a novel way of life called ‘Suburbia’. Meanwhile, in the 1950s the inhabitants of other industrial cities, including Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland and Philadelphia, had already experienced greener suburban pastures. But all those green trees died because of old age or pollution, and were not replaced. After a decade of the ‘Urban Renaissance’, the term used by Richard Rogers, came into light in 1990. Europe was never far behind to endorse urban sustainability. ‘The Green Paper on the Urban Development’ published in 1990 has been considered as a ‘milestone’ document in promoting <b>sustainable</b> <b>city</b> <b>projects</b> as a solution to global environmental role (Beatley, 2000). Lehmann (2010) mentioned that since then cities have engaged themselves in a global-scale competition with each other in three distinct areas. These are, firstly, to be regarded as an attractive, creative place and a cultural hub to attract highly skilled workers and Melbourne, Australia was strong competition with arts, museum and university; secondly, to get recognition as a place for secure investment, mention worthy, Dubai, Shanghai, and Singapore have topped in attracting and facilitating global investment capital; and thirdly, to become a leader of green vision for the future by technological advancement and offering environmentally sound lifestyles and also providing green jobs and Hannover, and Copenhagen did well in this field. After the earth Summit, 1992, different terms, including, sustaining <b>cities</b> (Leitmann, 1999), <b>sustainable</b> <b>cities</b> (Beatley, 2000), <b>sustainable</b> urbanism (Farr, 2008), green city (Karlenzig, 2007), eco-towns, eco districts and eco-cities (Lehmann, 2010), have tried to reduce environmental impacts on the cities and to achieve sustainable development and thus to live more peacefully, there. Both the green and <b>sustainable</b> <b>cities</b> present fundamental opportunities to apply new technologies for example, public transport, district heating, green building and green design and also bring major lifestyle changes such as, walking, bicycling, and reduce energy consumption. The major agenda of the all kinds of the above mentioned cities are tackling global climate change, biodiversity loss, and also lift themselves as ‘hosts’ of all environmental challenges. It has been argued that the focus of these theories are mainly on adjusting the relationship between the city and nature and also creating new cities other than renovating existing cities. To address the gap, Timothy Beatley and Steffen Lehmann used the ‘green urbanism’ theory that aims to transform existing cities from fragmentation to compaction.|$|R
30|$|In discursive terms, {{political}} action is {{of critical importance}} to the emergence, insertion, functioning, and evolution of smart <b>sustainable</b> <b>cities</b> as a new techno-urban discourse and an amalgam of innovation systems [14]. Indeed, political practice {{is at the core}} of the theory of discourse (e.g., [29]) and the theoretical framework of innovation system (e.g. [24, 41, 42, 58]) in terms of the shaping role of political mechanisms in the production and evolution of discourses and socio-technical systems governing technological innovations respectively. Recommendations for smart <b>sustainable</b> <b>cities</b> as a drastic techno-urban transformation, which entails a set of intertwined socio-technical systems and a cluster of interrelated discourses embedded in the wider socio-technical landscape, are unlikely to proceed without parallel {{political action}}s. Drastic shifts to sustainable technological regimes “entail concomitantly radical changes to the socio-technical landscape of politics, institutions, the economy, and social values” ([69], p. 131). From a discursive perspective, political processes are at the heart of material mechanisms and practices in terms of translating the vision of smart <b>sustainable</b> <b>cities</b> into concrete <b>projects</b> and strategies and their institutionalization in urban structures and practices [14]. And from an innovation system perspective, political processes represent the set-up under which dynamic networks of urban actors and entities can interact within diverse industrial sectors in the development, diffusion, and utilization of knowledge and technology pertaining to sustainable urban development.|$|R

To evaluate the requirements of this standard, simplified calculation method for assessment of the annual heating and total primary energy use based on EN ISO 13790 is used. As these calculations are strongly affected by the boundary conditions, they can only offer representative results for evaluation of the performance level of the design if the boundary conditions are defined properly. Therefore, to reassure objective and unambiguous evaluation, a variety of parameters is defined specifically for district sports centres: indoor temperature, occupancy rate, ventilation rate, user profile, internal heat gains and sanitary hot water use.

Household and business sentiment agrees that the situation has improved, but perennial management problems persist, such as the lack of an intermediate network of transfer points, and inadequate community support. These are underpinned by ambiguous governance, which results in unclear bylaws related to refuse collection charges (RCCs) and the issuing of only short-term contracts. Thus a set of transparent guidelines related to RCCs are urgently needed along with the legal framework to empower fee collection at grassroots level.

Performance goal setting and assessment with a n-bottom line (nBL) framework and following the performance approach in the planning, design and management of urban developments are introduced. CSIRO’s RD&D activities in <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Cities</b> are organised around three streams – (1) high performance built environments, (2) integrated urban design and development and (3) transitioning to <b>sustainable</b> and healthier <b>cities.</b> Selected <b>projects</b> are listed to demonstrate the scope and diversity of theme topics. Practical application of the n-bottom line (nBL) sustainability concept and the performance approach is demonstrated through an urban water project in New Zealand...|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the world}} the idea of <b>sustainable</b> <b>cities</b> (SCs) is gaining {{momentum}} in both academia and practice. <b>Sustainable</b> <b>cities</b> {{can be defined as}} urban areas that balance social, ecological and economic goals {{in such a way that}} they may, in principle, be continued into the foreseeable future. While worded as universal truths, theories about how to create such cities appear to have a Western bias. However, as Hofstede (2001) shows, it is highly questionable whether such Western-based theories are applicable across cultures. This thesis addresses the universality of the SC debate by comparing the way SCs are created in the EU and China. China - which shows large cultural differences with the EU - has grown into a critical player in global affairs and has also embarked on the development of SCs. This raises questions about the applicability of SC theory in this very different context: Will an autocratic government allow its citizens to dictate policy, or team up with non-governmental organizations? Will the power of the Chinese government lead to more mandatory policies? And could a focus on the individual lead to slower, more incremental developments in the EU? Such questions show how culture may be expected to influence the way SC projects are given shape. Thus an answer to the following research question was sought: To what extent do differences in culture account for any perceived differences in the process and content of <b>sustainable</b> <b>city</b> <b>projects</b> in the EU and China? 	In this thesis, UNEP’s Melbourne Principles for <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Cities</b> (MPs) are used as a summery of the most important aspects of SCs, focusing on both process and content. Hofstede’s (2001, and Hofstede and Hofstede, 2005) distinction between five aspects of culture – power distance, individuality vs. collectivism, masculinity vs. femininity, uncertainty avoidance and long-term vs. short-term orientation – is used as a model of culture. By linking relevant cultural characteristics pertaining to these five indexes to the MPs, the following five hypotheses were deducted. The relevant cultural indexes are named in parentheses. H 1 : While the EU will seek collaboration with a broad array of stakeholders (including NGOs and citizens); China will seek active participation only of consultants and powerful (government and business) interests (because of differences in power distance, individuality and masculinity). H 2 : While the EU will have broad, vague measures of progress; China will use narrower and quantitative assessment criteria (because of differences in masculinity). H 3 : While the EU aims for incremental technological- and land-use changes; China will create mega-projects and large transformations of space (because of differences in long-term orientation). H 4 : While the EU aims to create incentives for voluntary behavioral change through communication and mobilization strategies, China is more forceful, utilizing bans and penalties (because of differences in power distance and long-term orientation). H 5 : While the EU devotes much of its resources to welfare provisions (education, employment, aid, recreation, etc.); China invests only in prestigious physical projects and business interests (because of differences in masculinity) In this exploratory, qualitative study these hypotheses were tested for six cases; three in the EU - Almere, Leicester and Hammarby Sjöstad-Stockholm - and three in China - Dongtan, Tianjin and Rizhao. In addition to analyzing the influence of culture, the type of development – new city or area or retrofit of an existing city - was controlled for. The qualitative nature of the study also allowed for the finding of additional important variables. 	Both culture and the type of development were found to have an influence on the way SCs are given shape. Cultural differences appear to lead to differences concerning the use of mandatory measures (H 4). The large power distance and collective nature of Chinese culture may then lead to more forceful policies than in the EU, where only voluntary approaches were found. The relationship between culture and assessment criteria (H 2) and the choice of an incremental versus a rapid, large-scale approach (H 3) is less clear. While there were some interesting differences between the EU and China, qualitative assessment and a large-scale approach appear to be the norm in both contexts. The type of SC project was shown to be related to the level of inclusion of stakeholders (1) as well as the importance of welfare provisions (H 5), with both being more pronounced in retrofit cases. Additionally, this study showed the importance of economic variables and the amount of discretionary space of municipalities...|$|R

Cities are consuming three-quarters of the world's energy and causing three-quarters of global pollution. To reduce these impacts, new technologies have been considered {{in the development of}} smart <b>sustainable</b> <b>cities,</b> but technology has not always favoured the idea of sustainable consumption. To address this issue, we have aimed to focus on identifying the role of sustainable consumption within implementations of smart cities’ projects across Europe. We have selected a set of smart <b>city</b> <b>projects</b> in 76 <b>cities</b> in Europe from CONCERTO initiatives, Mapping Smart Cities in Europe, Energy Study for the Stockholm Region and Joint European Support for <b>Sustainable</b> Investment in <b>City</b> Areas and classified them according to: smart governance, smart mobility, smart living, smart environment, smart citizens and smart economy. Furthermore, we established a number of categories for the classification of the evaluated projects based on their relevance to sustainable consumption, and considered several solutions for the integration of sustainable consumption in smart <b>sustainable</b> <b>cities.</b> The results show that in 18. 9...|$|R
