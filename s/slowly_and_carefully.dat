5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with {{just the right amount of}} ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> <b>carefully,</b> to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E
25|$|The {{occupants}} of both graves were warriors, {{as indicated by}} their accompanying material: swords and weaponry. The chamber with the inhumation was extremely well preserved and had never been looted. For this reason, {{it was decided to}} remove the whole chamber en bloque and excavate it more <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> <b>carefully</b> in the State Service laboratory at Wiesbaden. The finds from the main burial chamber, each carefully wrapped in cloth, include a fine gold torc and a bronze tubular jug that had contained mead.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the total}} {{radioactivity}} of {{a dose of}} I-131 is usually high, and because the local beta radiation of nearby stomach tissue from an undissolved capsule is high, I-131 is usually administered to human patients in a small drink containing a few ounces of fluid(or alternatively in Capsule form). Liquid form administration is often <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> <b>carefully</b> sucked out of a shielded container to prevent spillage. For administration to animals (for example, cats with hyperthyroidism), for practical reasons the isotope must be administered by injection.|$|E

60|$|Sir Percy {{seemed in}} no hurry. He wrote <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> deliberately, <b>carefully</b> copying {{the draft of}} the letter which was propped {{up in front of}} him. The {{spelling}} of some of the French words seemed to have troubled him at first, for when he began he made many facetious and self-deprecatory remarks anent his own want of education, and carelessness in youth in acquiring the gentle art of speaking so elegant a language.|$|R
25|$|When {{the patient}} ingests {{just a small}} amount of food, the first {{response}} is a stretching of the wall of the stomach pouch, stimulating nerves which tell the brain that the stomach is full. The patient feels a sensation of fullness, as if they had just eaten a large meal—but with just a thimble-full of food. Most people do not stop eating simply in response to a feeling of fullness, but the patient rapidly learns that subsequent bites must be eaten very <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> <b>carefully,</b> to avoid increasing discomfort or vomiting.|$|E
25|$|His {{method was}} {{the reverse of}} the general {{approach}} of impressionism. He produced works <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> <b>carefully.</b> They {{were the result of}} close and detailed study. With some of his paintings, he made one hundred or more preliminary sketches. He was never satisfied with his works, and often painted multiple versions, years apart. He also changed and adjusted his methods constantly in order to obtain more effective arrangement, grouping and coloristic power. Repin's style of portraiture was unique, but owed something to the influence of Eduard Manet and Diego Velázquez.|$|E
25|$|In 1724, he {{was offered}} the chair of {{mathematics}} at Uppsala University, but he declined {{and said that he}} had dealt mainly with geometry, chemistry and metallurgy during his career. He also said {{that he did not have}} the gift of eloquent speech because of a stutter, as recognized by many of his acquaintances; it forced him to speak <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> <b>carefully,</b> and there are no known occurrences of his speaking in public. The Swedish critic Olof Lagerkrantz proposed that Swedenborg compensated for his impediment by extensive argumentation in writing.|$|E

500|$|For {{political}} scientists Betty Glad and Robert Blanton, Mandela was an [...] "exceptionally intelligent, shrewd, and loyal leader". His official biographer, Anthony Sampson, commented {{that he was}} a [...] "master of imagery and performance", excelling at presenting himself well in press photographs and producing sound bites. His public speeches were presented in a formal, stiff manner, and often consisted of clichéd set phrases. He typically spoke <b>slowly,</b> <b>and</b> <b>carefully</b> chose his words. Although he was not considered a great orator, his speeches conveyed [...] "his personal commitment, charm and humour".|$|E
500|$|While Rickey {{declined}} {{to pay for}} the purchasing rights of Robinson while he played for the Kansas City Monarchs, Veeck was [...] "determined to buy Doby's contract from the Eagles" [...] and had no problem paying purchasing rights. Effa Manley, business manager for the Eagles, believed her club's close relationship with the New York Yankees might put Doby in a Yankees uniform, but they did not take interest in him. Veeck finalized a contract deal for Doby with Manley on July 3. Veeck paid her a total of $15,000 for her second baseman—$10,000 for taking him from the Eagles and another $5,000 once it was determined he would stay with the Indians for at least 30 days. After Manley agreed to Veeck's offer, she stated to him, [...] "If Larry Doby were white and a free agent, you'd give him $100,000 to sign as a bonus." [...] The press were not told that Doby had been signed by the Indians as Veeck wanted to manage how fans in Cleveland would be introduced to Doby. [...] "I moved <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> <b>carefully,</b> perhaps even timidly", Veeck said. The Eagles had a doubleheader on July 4 but Doby, who had a [...]415 batting average and 14 home runs to that point in the season, only played in the first as Veeck sent his assistant and public relations personnel member, Louis Jones, for Doby. The two took a train from Newark to Chicago where the Indians were scheduled to play the Chicago White Sox the next day.|$|E
500|$|Heading {{into the}} new season, {{attention}} also focused on the McLaren team and its driver Nigel Mansell. He was initially announced as the partner of Mika Häkkinen; however, {{a week before the}} first race, McLaren announced that Mansell would not compete in the first two races of the new season, as he could not fit into the MP4/10 car. Mansell's arrival at McLaren was due to demand from the team's sponsors, including Philip Morris, whose brand, Marlboro, was on the car, who wanted to enjoy the publicity associated with the [...] World Champion's return even if it meant him performing worse than teammate Häkkinen. His place at McLaren for the first two races was taken by the team's test driver, Mark Blundell, as McLaren worked to build a wider monocoque to accommodate Mansell. McLaren were also concerned about the standard refuelling equipment provided for 1995 by suppliers Intertechnique, having suffered a major leak in a test of the new rig outside of its factory. Intertechnique had redesigned the fuel equipment, which was used by all of the teams, {{in the wake of a}} pit lane fire suffered by driver Jos Verstappen during the previous year's German Grand Prix. The new fuel rigs, in addition to being half the size of the 1994, also featured longer nozzles, and were designed to lock onto the car before any fuel could begin to flow. Intertechnique traced the problem to a faulty valve within the equipment, which caused [...] of fuel to leak, and modified the parts accordingly. Intertechnique and the FIA advised the teams to refuel the cars <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> <b>carefully</b> during pitstops to avoid any further leaks, a situation that was considered unsatisfactory by many of the team principals and mechanics. A new regulation for 1995 also mandated the teams' fuel suppliers to send samples of their fuel to the FIA prior to each Grand Prix, which the governing body would use as a reference when conducting fuel tests at the event itself. Thus only fuel approved by the FIA in advance was allowed; any deviations from the samples on file was not permitted. As before, all cars were subject to routine fuel tests as part of the scrutineering process throughout the weekend to ensure compliance with the sport's technical regulations. The rule change had been proposed by the Elf oil company in 1993 and unanimously supported by the other F1 suppliers in order to speed up the fuel-testing process.|$|E

I glanced over at Richard and thank God he wasn't looking at me, and I {{went into the bedroom}} and threw myself on the bed, buried my head into the pillow <b>and</b> screamed. Very <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> very <b>carefully,</b> I retraced all my steps in the bedroom. I took my {{slippers}} off, took my socks off, and got down on my hands and knees, looking everywhere for the pearl. Nothing. I thought, [...] "It's got to be in the living room in front of Richard. What am I going to do. He'll kill me! Because he loved the piece.|$|R
50|$|DPV {{operation}} {{requires more}} situational awareness than simply swimming and operating a DPV requires simultaneous depth control, buoyancy adjustment, monitoring of breathing gas, and navigation. Buoyancy control {{is vital for}} diver safety: The DPV {{has the capacity to}} compensate for poor buoyancy control while moving, but on stopping the diver may be dangerously positively or negatively buoyant if adjustments were not made to suit the changes in depth while moving. If the diver does not control the DPV properly, a rapid ascent or descent under power can result in barotrauma.Many forms of smaller marine life are very well camouflaged or hide well and are only seen by divers who move very <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> look <b>carefully.</b> The fast movement can frighten some fish into hiding or swimming away, and since the diver is not kicking for propulsion, they will generally get colder due to lower physical activity and increased water flow.|$|R
2500|$|Radiographic IMT is {{more often}} {{approximated}} using advanced CAT scanners due {{to the ability to}} use software to more <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> <b>carefully</b> process the images (after the patient's scan has been completed) and then examine artery segments from whatever angle appears most appropriate.

2500|$|Limestone Lad was {{scheduled}} to be offered for sale as a three-year-old gelding at Tattersalls Ireland in June 1995, but was withdrawn from the auction after the auctioneer's vet found that he had an abnormal heartbeat. The gelding was officially trained throughout his racing career by James Bowe, although the day-to-day handling was managed by his son Michael on the family farm which was also home to 60 cattle and 150 sheep. Commenting on the process of training the horse Michael Bowe said [...] "Everything you taught him, you had to do it <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> <b>carefully</b> - but once he picked it up he would die or do it. He was so genuine, all {{he wanted to do was}} to please you". [...] He was often subjected to demanding schedules, with few breaks: Bowe explained the strategy by saying [...] "He is happiest racing frequently and the more you take him racing the more he likes it".|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the main}} {{arguments}} against human germline engineering lies in the ethical feeling that it will dehumanize children. At an extreme, parents {{may be able to}} completely design their own child, and there is a fear that this will transform children into objects, rather than human beings. There is also a large opposition as people state that by engineering the human germline, there is an attempt at [...] "playing God", and there is a strong opposition to this. One final, and very possible issue that causes a strong opposition of this technology is one that lies within the scientific community itself. Inevitably, this technology would be used for enhancements to the genome, which would likely cause many more to use these same enhancements. By doing this, the genetic diversity of the human race and the human gene pool as we know it would <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> surely diminish. Despite the controversy surrounding the topic of human germline engineering, it is <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> very <b>carefully</b> making its way into many labs around the world. These experiments are highly regulated, and they do not include the use of viable human embryos, which allows scientists to refine the techniques, without posing a threat to any real human beings.|$|R
50|$|In EVA, most {{work is done}} <b>slowly,</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>and</b> methodically {{not because}} of the neutral {{buoyancy}} training but because that is how a task must be performed by a pressurized astronaut in weightlessness. It takes more force to accelerate a mass to a higher velocity, and then to slow the mass back down, than to move it slowly to its destination. It is also easier to control its movement if it is moving slowly. Thus, the drag of water on movement in neutral buoyancy simply necessitates a slowness of movement that is also appropriate to spaceflight.|$|R
2500|$|The Field Museum hired a {{specialized}} moving company {{with experience in}} transporting delicate items to move the bones to Chicago. The truck arrived at the museum in October 1997. Two new research laboratories funded by McDonald's were created and staffed by Field Museum preparators whose job was to <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> <b>carefully</b> remove all the rock, or [...] "matrix", from the bones. One preparation lab was at the Field Museum itself, the other was at the newly opened Animal Kingdom in Disney World in Orlando. Millions of visitors observed the preparation of Sue's bones through glass windows in both labs. Footage of the work was also put on the museum's website. Several of the fossil's bones had never been discovered, so preparators produced models of the missing bones from plastic to complete the exhibit. The modeled bones were colored in a purplish hue so that visitors could observe which bones were real and which bones were plastic. The preparators also poured molds of each bone. All the molds were sent to a company outside Toronto to be cast in hollow plastic. Field Museum kept one set of disarticulated casts in its research collection. The other sets were incorporated into mounted cast skeletons. One set of the casts was sent to Disney's Animal Kingdom in Florida to be presented for public display. Two other mounted casts were placed into a traveling tour that {{was sponsored by the}} McDonald's Corporation.|$|E
2500|$|England, having {{achieved}} a lead of 141 on first innings, pushed onwards {{on the third}} day, losing one wicket {{in each of the}} first two sessions, though they had the benefit of West Indies' fielding being between [...] "amateurish and abysmal" [...] according to Cricinfo journalist Andrew McGlashan. Vaughan fell in the forties once again, a return catch for Darren Sammy's second Test wicket, while Kevin Pietersen fell to a bizarre dismissal when West Indian all-rounder Dwayne Bravo delivered a 70mph bouncer, knocking off Pietersen's helmet which fell onto the stumps, leaving Pietersen out hit wicket. After tea, Gayle broke through to have Cook lbw for 106, before Sammy took six wickets in a seven-over spell to end with figures of seven for 66, the second best by a West Indies bowler on debut, and the best by a debutant in 57 years. Among the wickets was Bell's for two, causing his average at six to drop between 75. The fourth innings had only 8 overs in which Gayle scored a quick four, but Harmison continued the Test's string of early dismissals trapping Ganga plumb for a duck. This didn't stop the West Indies attacking to their target of 455 as 3 more fours were hit, despite two massive appeals from Panesar. The Windies batted <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> <b>carefully</b> over the two days and ended up falling only 61 runs short of winning the match. If they had reached the total {{it would have been the}} highest fourth innings total ever to win a Test match. Shivnarine Chanderpaul top scored with 116 not out.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{mentioned}} that the underground passage runs under Feathered Serpent Temple, and the entrance is located a few meters away from the temple at the expected place, designedly sealed with large boulders nearly 2000 years ago. The hole that had appeared during the 2003 storms was not the actual entrance. A vertical shaft of almost 5 meters by side is the access to the tunnel: it goes 14 meters deep, and the entrance leads to a nearly 100 meters long corridor that ends {{in a series of}} underground galleries in the rock. After archaeologists broke ground at the entrance of the tunnel a staircase and ladders that would allow easy access to the subterranean site were installed. Works advanced a painstaking pace very <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> <b>carefully.</b> Excavating was done manually, with spades. Nearly 1,000 tons of soil and debris were removed from the tunnel. There were large spiral seashells, cat bones, pottery, fragments of human skin. The rich array of objects unearthed included: wooden masks covered with inlaid rock jade and quartz, elaborate necklaces, rings, greenstone crocodile teeth and human figurines, crystals shaped into eyes, beetle wings arranged in a box, sculptures of jaguars, and hundreds of metallized spheres. The mysterious globes lay in both the north and south chambers. Ranging from 40 to 130 millimetres, the balls have a core of clay and are covered with a yellow jarosite formed by the oxidation of pyrite. According to George Cowgill from Arizona State University the spheres are a fascinating find, [...] "Pyrite was certainly used by the Teotihuacanos and other ancient Mesoamerican societies. Originally the spheres would have shown brilliantly. They are indeed unique, but I have no idea what they mean." [...] All these artifacts were deposited deliberately and pointedly, as if in offering to appease the gods.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the Federal lines, the regiment was sent to remain in reserve on Seminary Ridge, the ridge closest to town and named for the Lutheran Theological Seminary that stood there. While placed near the Seminary, the 151st and other units began constructing crude breastworks in case the area should be needed as a defensive fall-back point. At roughly 3:00 PM, the regiment - by now the last reserve of the I Corps - was ordered forward into a gap that had formed in the main Federal line on McPherson's Ridge. McPherson's Ridge runs parallel to Seminary Ridge and is separated by low hollow about 300 yards wide. The regiment advanced from Seminary Ridge, across the hollow, to McPherson's Ridge. Quickly forming their line on the ridge {{just in front of}} a woodlot named Herbst Woods, the regiment was immediately struck by a volley from Confederate troops in the trees. Urging his men to fire <b>slowly</b> <b>and</b> aim <b>carefully,</b> Lt. Col. McFarland ordered the regiment to fire at will.

How such a piece of wire could have got into the tank was a mystery, but the general impression was that it had been carried there by accident and forced into the coil by the pressure of the paying-out machinery as the cable flew through the jockey-wheels.|$|R
