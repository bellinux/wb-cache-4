The purposes of this study were to investigate distinctive metabolic changes in urine samples of BD patients and to identify urinary metabolic biomarkers for diagnosis of BD using gas chromatography/time-of-flight–mass spectrometry (GC/TOF−MS). Metabolomic profiling of urine samples from 44 BD patients and 41 healthy controls (HC) were assessed using GC/TOF−MS, in conjunction with multivariate statistical analysis. A total of 110 urinary metabolites were identified. The urine metabolite profiles obtained from GC/TOF−MS analysis could distinguish BD patients from the HC group in the discovery set. The parameter values of the orthogonal partial least squared-discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) model were R 2 X of 0. 231, R 2 Y of 0. 804, and Q 2 of 0. 598. A biomarker panel composed of guanine, pyrrole- 2 -carboxylate, 3 -hydroxypyridine, mannose, l-citrulline, galactonate, isothreonate, <b>sedoheptuloses,</b> hypoxanthine, and gluconic acid lactone were selected and adequately validated as putative biomarkers of BD (sensitivity 96. 7 %, specificity 93. 3 %, area under the curve 0. 974).

50|$|<b>Sedoheptulose</b> 7-{{phosphate}}, a pentose phosphate pathway intermediate, is {{a common}} precursor of C7N aminocyclitol moiety of natural products, such as acarbose, validamycin A, salbostatin, cetoniacytone A, and pyralomicin 1a. 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase (EEVS), one of the sugar phosphate cyclase family enzyme and which is a homolog of 3-dehydroquinate synthase in shikimate pathway, catalyzes {{the formation of a}} common intermediate, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone from <b>sedoheptulose</b> 7-phosphate. After multiple enzyme reaction steps, which include phosphorylation, epimerization, dehydration, and keto-reduction reactions, valienol, an important core structure is formed which leads to the formation of C7N aminocyclitol containing natural products. In validamycin biosynthesis, the C-N linkage which connect the C7 cyclitol moiety to the other was found to be formed by unprecedented actions of nucleotidyltransferase and glycosyltransferase-like enzymes (which is termed pseudoglycosyltransferase).|$|E

5000|$|Enzymes that {{transfer}} aldehyde or ketone {{groups and}} included in EC 2.2. This category consists of various transketolases and transaldolases. [...] Transaldolase, the namesake of aldehyde transferases, {{is an important}} part of the pentose phosphate pathway. [...] The reaction it catalyzes consists of a transfer of a dihydroxyacetone functional group to Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (also known as G3P). The reaction is as follows: <b>sedoheptulose</b> 7-phosphate + glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate [...] erythrose 4-phosphate + fructose 6-phosphate.|$|E
5000|$|Fructose-bisphosphate {{aldolase}} (...) , {{often just}} aldolase, is an enzyme catalyzing a reversible reaction that splits the aldol, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, into the triose phosphates dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). Aldolase can also produce DHAP from other (3S,4R)-ketose 1-phosphates such as fructose 1-phosphate and <b>sedoheptulose</b> 1,7-bisphosphate. Gluconeogenesis and the Calvin cycle, which are anabolic pathways, use the reverse reaction. Glycolysis, a catabolic pathway, uses the forward reaction. Aldolase {{is divided into}} two classes by mechanism.|$|E
50|$|With transaldolase {{deficiency}} {{there is}} a buildup of <b>sedoheptulose</b> 7-phosphate (it is increased six to sevenfold in the blood compared to normal), which decreases the change of ribose 5-phosphate into glucose 6-phosphate. This reaction is important in releasing NADPH. Reduced glutathione is essential for regulation of Mitochondrial membrane permeability and depends on the NADPH generated from the pentose phosphate pathway to be regenerated from oxidized glutathione. Transaldolase {{plays an important role}} in male fertility; this is because it maintains the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and its role in the release NADPH. Therefore, transaldolase deficiency decreases the mobility of spermatozoa and lowers male fertility.|$|E
50|$|A {{network of}} {{reactions}} adopted from the glycolysis pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway {{is shown in}} which the labeled carbon isotope rearranges to different carbon positions throughout the network of reactions. The network starts with fructose 6-phosphate (F6P), which has 6 carbon atoms with a label 13C at carbon position 1 and 2. 1,2-13C F6P becomes two glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), one 2,3-13C T3P and one unlabeled T3P. The 2,3-13C T3P can now be reacted with <b>sedoheptulose</b> 7-phosphate (S7P) to form an unlabeled erythrose 4-phosphate(E4P) and a 5,6-13C F6P. The unlabeled T3P will react with the S7P to synthesize unlabeled products. The figure demonstrates the use of stable isotope labeling to discover the carbon atom rearrangement through reactions using position specific labeled compounds.|$|E
50|$|The Calvin {{cycle is}} a carbon {{fixation}} pathway. It and gluconeogenesis share {{a series of}} four reversible reactions. In both pathways 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA or 3-PG) is reduced to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate with aldolase catalyzing the last reaction. A fifth reaction, catalyzed in both pathways by fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, hydrolyzes the fructose 1-6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate and inorganic phosphate. The large decrease in free energy makes this reaction irreversible. In the Calvin cycle aldolase also catalyzes the production of <b>sedoheptulose</b> 1,7-bisphosphate from DHAP and erythrose 4-phosphate. The chief products of the Calvin cycle are triose phosphate (TP), which {{is a mixture of}} DHAP and G3P, and fructose 6-phosphate. Both are also needed to regenerate RuBP. The aldolase used by plants and algae in the Calvin cycle is usually a plastid-targeted protein encoded by a nuclear gene.|$|E
50|$|The {{metabolic}} {{state of}} the chloroplast changes considerably between night and day. During the day, the chloroplast is actively harvesting the energy of light and converting it into chemical energy. The activation of the metabolic pathways involved comes from {{the changes in the}} chemical nature of the stroma on the addition of light. H+ is pumped out of the stroma (into both the cytoplasm and the lumen) leading to an alkaline pH. Mg2+ (along with K+) is released from the lumen into the stroma, in an electroneutralisation process to balance the flow of H+. Finally, thiol groups on enzymes are reduced by a change in the redox {{state of the}} stroma. Examples of enzymes activated in response to these changes are fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, <b>sedoheptulose</b> bisphosphatase and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase. During the dark period, if these enzymes were active a wasteful cycling of products and substrates would occur.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the well documented roles of its mono- and bisphosphate esters, the occurrence of free <b>sedoheptulose</b> in plant tissues remains a matter of conjecture. The present work sought to determine the origin of <b>sedoheptulose</b> formation in planta {{as well as its}} physiological importance. Elevated CO 2 and sucrose induction experiments were used to study <b>sedoheptulose</b> metabolism in the CAM plants Kalanchoë pinnata and Sedum spectabile. Experimental evidence suggests that <b>sedoheptulose</b> is produced from the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway intermediate sedoheptulose- 7 -phosphate, by a sedoheptulose- 7 -phosphate phosphatase. Carbon flux through this pathway is stimulated by increased triose-P levels (elevated CO 2, compromised sink availability, sucrose incubation of source leaves) and attenuated by ADP and Pi. The accumulation of free <b>sedoheptulose</b> is proposed to act as a mechanism contributing to both C and P homeostasis by serving as an alternative carbon store under elevated CO 2 or compromised sink capacity to avoid sucrose accumulation, depletion of inorganic phosphate and suppression of photosynthesis. It remains to be established whether this acclimation avoiding mechanism is confined to CAM plants, which might be especially vulnerable to Pi imbalances, or whether some C 3 and C 4 plants also dispose of the genetic capacity to induce and accelerate <b>sedoheptulose</b> synthesis upon CO 2 elevation. status: publishe...|$|E

This method can be utilized as a quick screening test to detect cystinosis patients homozygous for the 57 -kb deletion in CTNS; {{which is the most}} common mutation of cystinosis. <b>Sedoheptulose</b> concentrations in the deleted patients were 6 to 23 times above the upper limit for controls.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study some {{steady-state}} kinetic properties of sedoheptulose- 1, 7 -bisphosphatase, its pH-dependence and the effect of a substrate analogue, fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate. Studies were carried out with <b>sedoheptulose</b> 1, 7 -bisphosphate and with fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate, an alternative substrate. The pK values are identical for both substrates, and fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate behaves like a competitive inhibitor. These results suggest that there exists a unique active site for either <b>sedoheptulose</b> 1, 7 -bisphosphate or fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate on the enzyme molecule. Increasing Mg 2 + concentrations shifted the optimum pH. As for fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase, we believe that this shift is due to the neutralization of negative charges near the active centre [Cadet, Meunier & Ferté (1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 162, 393 - 398]. The free species of <b>sedoheptulose</b> 1, 7 -bisphosphate and fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate are not the usual substrates of enzyme, nor is Mg 2 +. But the kinetics relative to the (Mg 2 +-substrate 4 -) 2 - complex is not consistent with this complex being the substrate. An explanation of this discrepancy is proposed, involving both the negative charges near the active centre and the positive charges of Mg 2 +. The observed Vmax. of the reduced enzyme is 65 % of the theoretical Vmax. for both substrates, but the observed Vmax. relative to <b>sedoheptulose</b> 1, 7 -bisphosphate is 3 times the one relative to fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate.

Using the horticultural hybrid polyanthus (Primula × polyantha) as our model plant, we found that volemitol is the major nonstructural carbohydrate in leaves of all stages of development, with concentrations of up to 50 mg/g fresh weight in source leaves (about 25 % of the dry weight), followed by <b>sedoheptulose</b> (d-altro- 2 -heptulose, 36 mg/g fresh weight), and sucrose (4 mg/g fresh weight). Volemitol was shown by the ethylenediaminetetraacetate-exudation technique to be a prominent phloem-mobile carbohydrate. It accounted for about 24 % (mol/mol) of the phloem sap carbohydrates, surpassed only by sucrose (63 %). Preliminary 14 CO 2 pulse-chase radiolabeling experiments showed that volemitol was a major photosynthetic product, preceded by the structurally related ketose <b>sedoheptulose.</b> Finally, we present evidence for a novel NADPH-dependent ketose reductase, tentatively called <b>sedoheptulose</b> reductase, in volemitol-containing Primula species, and propose it as responsible for the biosynthesis of volemitol in planta. Using enzyme extracts from polyanthus leaves, we determined that <b>sedoheptulose</b> reductase has a pH optimum between 7. 0 and 8. 0, a very high substrate specificity, and displays saturable concentration dependence for both <b>sedoheptulose</b> (apparent Km = 21 mm) and NADPH (apparent Km = 0. 4 mm).

Immunoprecipitation with purified CP 12 antibodies supported these data. The dissociation constant between CP 12 and fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate (EC 4. 1. 2. 13) aldolase was measured by surface plasmon resonance and is equal to 0. 48 +/- 0. 05 mum and thus corroborated an interaction between CP 12 and aldolase. However, the association is even stronger between aldolase and the phosphoribulokinase/glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase/CP 12 complex and the dissociation constant between them is equal to 55 +/- 5 nm.
