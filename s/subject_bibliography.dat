40|$|The {{impetus for}} this paper arose {{out of a}} concern for the future of {{acquisitions}} at the Merrill Library. The common denominator between all disciplines represented in a university environment, the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge, is embodied in the academic library. The quest for knowledge often begins in the library; and the results of scholarly investigations are deposited on its shelves. As the quantity of published information increases, the importance of library collections as a vital element in the university community becomes increasingly evident. In recent years, American academic library collections have suffered in the face of double-digit inflation. The Merrill Library is also experiencing this inflation-born atrophy of acquisitions. The purpose of the study is to examine the erosion of library purchasing power in terms of its effects upon library collections and the collection of the Merrill Library in particular. Central to this purpose {{is the way in which}} the Merrill Library has attempted to cope with the rising price of library materials. The data used for the basis of this study were derived from the published literature and from the reports of Utah State University and the Merrill Library. The <b>Subject</b> <b>Bibliography</b> of Current Serials, 1976, prepared by the Merrill Library provided the basic data for several sections dealing with serial publications...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{consider}} some relatively unorthodox, fairly bibliographically free aspects of magazine selection an {{approach in the}} worst tradition of the essentially fact-for-fact oriented library literature. However, anyone seeking orthodox information about indexes, abstracts or access to bibliographical information on magazines is referred to WinchelFs Guide to Reference Books where it is all put precisely and accurately. In a more discursive readable fashion, William Huff has achieved {{much the same thing}} in his exellent article "Periodicals" in the January 1967, issue of Library Trends. Also, in my book, Magazines for Libraries, one will find a relatively exhaustive general and <b>subject</b> <b>bibliography</b> to the field. Discussing what he terms a psychograph of adolescent rebellion, Bruno Bettelheim states that today's youth are frustrated "because modern technology has made them obsolete they have become socially irrelevant and, as persons, insignificant. " 1 Much the same might be said of the present art of magazine selection. Technology, from the "until forbidden" order to reliance on indexes and computerized records apparently has made much of the process obsolete. Large libraries, at any rate, now no longer select as much as collect. In so doing, it seems to me, they have made the magazine socially irrelevant, at least to all but a small, highly selected segment of the community. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
