40|$|Die Standardlösung zur Abdichtung von Wellen im Maschinenbau sind Radial-Wellendichtringe (RWDR) aus Elastomeren. Allerdings stoßen Elastomer-Werkstoffe in vielen Anwendungen an ihre Belastungsgrenzen. Durch Einsatz von PTFE-Compounds als Dichtungswerkstoff können die Einschränkungen von Elastomeren weitgehend überwunden werden. Daher werden in der Dichtungstechnik immer häufiger Manschettendichtungen aus PTFE-Compounds (PTFE-MD) eingesetzt. Im Gegensatz zu Elastomer-RWDR sind bei PTFE-MD Rückförderstrukturen (RS) erforderlich, um die dynamische Dichtheit zu gewährleisten. Für Anwendungen mit festgelegter Drehrichtung der Welle gehören PTFE-MD mit Spiralrille zum bewährten Stand der Technik. Die Spiralrille als RS ist aber nur für eine Drehrichtung der Welle geeignet. Bei wechselnder Wellendrehrichtung werden andere RS verwendet. Es gibt zwar bereits funktionierende PTFE-MD mit RS für beide Drehrichtungen der Welle, allerdings sind diese noch im Erforschungsstadium und weisen Optimierungspotenziale auf. Trotz des hohen potenziellen Nutzens für Dichtungsanwender durch die Verfügbarkeit von optimierten PTFE-MD mit RS, insbesondere für beide Drehrichtungen der Welle, gibt es kaum Fortschritte seitens der Dichtungshersteller. Dies liegt im Wesentlichen daran, dass die entsprechenden Funktionsmechanismen nicht hinreichend bekannt sind. Ohne Kenntnis der genauen Funktionsmechanismen ist eine gezielte Optimierung nicht möglich. Daher muss mit hohem experimentellem Aufwand durch „Versuch und Irrtum“ optimiert werden. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist es einen Beitrag zum besseren Verständnis der dynamischen Funktionsmechanismen von PTFE-MD mit RS, insbesondere für beide Drehrichtungen der Welle, zu leisten. Dabei liegt das Hauptaugenmerk der Arbeit auf der numerischen Untersuchung der nachfolgenden Zusammenhänge. • Analyse des Strömungsverlaufs und der Druckverteilung um RS und im Dichtspalt. Dies dient einem besseren Verständnis der Vorgänge im Bereich des Dichtspalts. • Untersuchung unterschiedlicher Einflüsse auf das Umlenk- und Fördervermögen von RS. Ziel ist dabei die Identifikation von relevanten Einflussgrößen auf das Fördervermögen von PTFE-MD mit RS. • Analyse des Förderverhaltens durch den hydrodynamischen Dichtspalt und durch lokale Erhöhungen des Dichtspalts. • Betrachtung der Einflüsse der Dichtspaltgeometrie auf den Förderwert einer PTFE-MD mit RS. • Untersuchung der Auswirkungen von Geometrievariationen am Übergang einer RS in den geschlossenen Ring auf das Druckaufbauvermögen und damit auch indirekt auf das Fördervermögen von PTFE-MD mit RS. Durch ein besseres Verständnis der obigen Zusammenhänge können die dynamischen Funktionsmechanismen von PTFE-MD mit RS besser nachvollzogen werden. Hieraus lassen sich besonders wirkungsvolle Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung des Fördervermögens und damit der dynamischen Dichtsicherheit von PTFE-MD mit RS ableiten. Damit ist eine effektivere Optimierung möglich, wodurch der experimentelle Aufwand bei der Weiterentwicklung von PTFE-MD mit RS reduziert werden kann. The common {{solution}} for sealing shafts {{in mechanical engineering}} is the usage of radial shaft seals made of elastomers. However elastomers encounter load limits in many applications. Through the application of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) compounds as sealing material, the limitations of elastomers can be largely overcome. Therefore the usage of lip seals made of PTFE compounds is becoming more common in sealing technology. In contrast to the elastomeric radial shaft seals PTFE lip seals require special pumping structures to ensure their dynamic tightness. For applications with a fixed direction of shaft rotation PTFE lip seals with a spiral groove as pumping structure are established as state of the art. The spiral groove as pumping structure is only suitable for one direction of shaft rotation. For alternating directions of shaft rotation other pumping structures are used. Although functioning PTFE lip seals with pumping structures for both directions of shaft rotation are already in existence, these {{are still in the}} research stage and there is potential for optimization. Despite the high potential benefit for users through the availability of optimized PTFE lip seals with pumping structures, particularly for both directions of shaft rotation, there is little progress by the seal manufacturers. The main reason for lack in progress is deficient knowledge about the functional mechanisms of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures. Without knowing the exact functional mechanisms targeted optimization is hardly possible. Therefore optimization of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures requires high experimental effort and is accomplished by "trial and error". The aim of this thesis is to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the dynamic functional mechanisms of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures, particularly for both directions of shaft rotation. The focus of this thesis is the numerical investigation of the following topics. • Analysis of the flow pattern and pressure distribution around pumping structures and in the <b>sealing</b> <b>gap.</b> This serves a better understanding of the processes in the region of the <b>sealing</b> <b>gap.</b> • Investigation of various influences on the deflection and pumping ability of pumping structures. The objective is to identify the relevant parameters for the pumping ability of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures. • Analysis of the pumping behaviour through the hydrodynamic <b>sealing</b> <b>gap</b> and through local elevations of the <b>sealing</b> <b>gap.</b> • Exploration of the influences of the <b>sealing</b> <b>gap</b> geometry on the pumping ability of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures. • Investigation of the effects of geometry variations in the transitional area between pumping structures and the continuously closes ring, which is necessary for static tightness. The geometry of this area is crucial for pressure build-up and thus indirectly for the pumping ability of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures. Through a better understanding of the above topics, the dynamic functional mechanisms of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures are described more accurately than before. This allows to identify especially effective measures to improve the pumping ability and thus the dynamic sealing reliability of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures. The mentioned measures imply a more efficient optimization, whereby the experimental effort in the advancement of PTFE lip seals with pumping structures can be significantly reduced...|$|E

30|$|Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) {{has been}} studied for monitoring the condition of mechanical seals by many researchers, however to the best knowledge of the authors, typical fault cases and their effects on tribological behaviour of mechanical seals {{have not yet been}} successfully investigated. In this paper, AE signatures from common faults of mechanical seals are studied in association with tribological behaviour of <b>sealing</b> <b>gap</b> to develop more reliable condition monitoring approaches. A purpose-built test rig was employed for recording AE signals from the mechanical seals under healthy and faulty conditions. The collected data was then processed using time domain and frequency domain analysis methods. The study has shown that AE signal parameters: root mean squared (RMS) along with AE spectrum, allows fault conditions including dry running, spring out and defective seal faces to be diagnosed under a wide range of operating conditions. However, when mechanical seals operate around their transition point, conventional signal processing methods may not allow a clear separation of the fault conditions from the healthy baseline. Therefore an auto-regressive (AR) model has been developed on recorded AE signals to classify different fault conditions of mechanical seals and satisfactory results have been perceived.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Published {{experimental}} data and results of numerical modelling {{have shown that}} in certain cases the temperature gradient along the radius of the <b>sealing</b> <b>gap</b> of mechanical face seals (MFSs) can be significant. As a consequence, isothermal calculation of seal performance characteristics can induce some errors. In a recent paper, Pascovici and Etsion investigated {{the accuracy of the}} steady state isoviscous solution of the Reynolds equation in an MFS with flat and aligned surfaces (parallel faces). The aim of the present paper is to continue the investigation to the more general case of a non-parallel film. Hence, an analytical non-isothermal solution of the Reynolds equation for an MFS with coning is developed. The solution, based on a simplified linear temperature distribution across the seal dam, allows the seal performance characteristics for inwardly convergent, externally pressurized seals to be calculated. A parametric study is performed in order to define the level of approximation made by the isoviscous solution. It is found that, for a practical range of seal operation conditions, the accuracy of the isoviscous solution is acceptable for the opening force, film stiffness and frictional torque. On the contrary, the isoviscous solution can lead to an important underestimation of the leakage for almost all practical cases. The errors depend on two variables representative of the film thickness and viscosity variation in the seal dam...|$|E

The published version is available from [URL] only entryThis study presents an analytical model that uses directly measurable flow quantities to predict the effects of leakage on shrouded turbine stage performance. The model displays good predictive ability for the mass leakage fraction, for the tip leakage and for the mixing losses. The model resolves the negative incidence angle induced by mixing the leakage flow with the main stream and predicts the increment in the total mixing loss coefficient at increasing injection angles. The effects of the labyrinth seal geometry, such as the tip gap width and the number of seals, on the associated leakage losses {{as well as on the}} turbine stage performance are adequately represented. Overall, the present model exhibits a good qualitative and quantitative agreement with comparative benchmark data. It is concluded that increasing the labyrinth through-flow resistance by increasing the number of fins leads to a decrement in the leakage flow and its adverse effects but the effectiveness of this reduction decreases as the number of fins increases by more than three. The mass leakage fraction, tip leakage loss coefficient and total mixing loss coefficient increase linearly as the <b>sealing</b> <b>gap</b> ratio increases.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a feasibility study on air-riding seal aeroelasticity for large-diameter aero-engines. A literature survey of previous seal studies revealed a significant amount of experimental work but numerical modeling using CFD techniques was relatively scarce. Indeed, most existing theoretical studies either deal with the structural behavior, or use simplified flow modeling. The aeroelasticity stability of a simplified air-riding seal geometry, devised for this particular feasibility study, was analyzed in three dimensions for typical engine operating conditions. Both the unsteady flow and structural vibration aspects were considered in the investigation. The boundary conditions and the <b>seal</b> <b>gap</b> were varied to explore the capabilities and limitations of a state-of-the-art unsteady flow and aeroelasticity code. The methodology was based on integrating the fluid and structural domains in a time-accurate fashion by exchanging boundary condition information at each time step. The predicted characteristics, namely lift and flow leakage as a function of pressure and <b>seal</b> <b>gap,</b> were found to be in agreement with the expected behavior. Operating <b>seal</b> <b>gaps</b> were determined from the actual time histories of the seal motion under the effect of the aerodynamic and the restoring spring forces. Both stable and unstable cases were considered. It was concluded that, in principle, the existing numerical tools could be used for the flow and aeroelasticity analyses of hydrostatic seals. However, due to large Mach number variations, the solution convergence rate was relatively slow and it was recognized that a preconditioner was needed to handle seal flows. For small gaps of about 10 microns, typical of spiral groved seals, the flow has a high Knudsen number, indicating that the Navier-Stokes formulations may no longer be valid. Such cases require a totally different treatment for the modeling of steady and unsteady aerodynamics, either by modifying the transport parameters of the Navier-Stokes equations or by considering rarefied gas dynamics...|$|R
