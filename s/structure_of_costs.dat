5000|$|The first {{statement}} {{of the theory of}} transformational growth came in 1988 in his book Prosperity and Public Spending, laying out the idea that markets worked differently when technology was craft-based. Costs were structured differently, and it made sense that prices would be flexible, but employment would tend to be inflexible. This gave rise to incentives to change the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs,</b> however, leading to Mass Production, and cost conditions in which it makes sense to hold prices steady and vary employment.|$|E
5000|$|Nell is the {{originator}} of the Theory of Transformational Growth, which {{traces the}} pattern of capitalist development through a succession of stages, in each of which markets adjust differently, and in doing so, give rise to market pressures leading to innovations which move the system to the next stage. In each stage the working of markets will be governed {{in part by the}} <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> and {{the pattern of}} growth in demand, both of which depend on technology and innovation. The approach draws on the empirical work of Simon Kuznets, and makes use of Nicholas Kaldors notion of stylized facts; it also draws on the work of W. Arthur Lewis and Gunnar Myrdal in regard to stages of development. It is, however, consistent only in part with Robert Solows neo-Classical approach; as in that construction the substitution of capital for labor is crucial. However, transformational growth rejects the idea of a steady state and presents a model of multiple sectors regularly changing in size and importance. On the other hand, Douglass Norths emphasis on institutions is echoed here. Ross Thomson (2004, pp. 81) argued that Understanding capitalist development is still beyond the capabilities of economic theory, at least in its formalized version. Intrinsically innovative, uneven across sectors and countries, and evolving through qualitative changes in institutional structure, development involves such complexity that major insights, including those of Marx,Veblen, Schumpeter, and Chandler, often come from outside formal theory. The usefulness of these insights suggests that theory must be reconceptualized to understand capitalist development. Edward Nell attempts such a reconceptualization. Nell portrays development as a cumulative process in which economic institutions and technologies evolve in a single, mutually engendering dynamic. In the General Theory of Transformational Growth (1998), he gives theory the task of understanding this cummulative process. In the TG approach, markets generate innovations, most importantly technological changes, and these innovations restructure markets. This process imparts a direction to capitalist development as sectors rise and fall, production is reorganized, and markets are reshaped.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the article: Companies, {{like all}} living creatures, goes through their life cycle, which {{includes}} some partial phases. Each of these phases is specific. Depending up the corporate life cycle, there are changed managerial decisions, {{that have an}} considerable influence, among others, on financial indicators like liquidity (current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio), return (on investment, assets, equity, sales), economic value added, or <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital. The {{purpose of this article}} is to show relations between corporate life cycle and the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity. Furthermore, there will be, besides the corporate life cycle, considered also the market life cycle and market positions, that can companies hold on the market, on which they are acting. Methodology/methods: There is used a method, based on the analysis of secondary data, gotten from financial statements of selected companies and from statistical and analytical documents, published by Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade. There are selected 39 companies, acting on the czech market with motor vehicles production. The data are gathered for periods from 2002 up to 2010. There is used a model by Reiners (2004) to identify phases of corporate- and market life cycle and market positions. For finding out the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity there is used the constructional model by Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade. Scientific aim: The selected companies are divided into groups with considering different phases of their life cycle and with considering their different market positions. There are for each period found out numbers of companies from these groups, that reached the minimal value, the value within the interval and maximal value of all risk rewards, that are, besides the riskless rate, components <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity. Findings: The greatest part <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity, reached on the market, is the riskless rate. Other components (and their shares on the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity, reached on the market) except risk reward to size of the company were increasing mostly since 2007. By researching the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity in the case of selected companies, there were found out only small differences between companies in different phases of their life cycle and only small differences between companies, that hold different market positions. Conclusions: There are some limits connected with these findings. The constructional model for <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity calculation was developed for czech firms, so the generalizing for foreign companies and markets is limited. And the model by Reiners (2004) can identify phases of corporate- and market life cycle only using the interyear comparison of quantities, that are involved in the growth indicator, and furthermore, there isn’t possible to identify corporate- and market foundation...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of the article: All {{national}} economies {{go through their}} economic cycle and partial sectors of these economies go through their market life cycle, too. But {{the course of the}} market life cycle doesn’t have to ever be the same {{as in the case of}} the economic cycle. So, there exist sectors with different sensitivities to economic cycle. The sector sensitivity can considerably influence many financial quantities, especially quantities describing the entrepreneurial risk, which can be expressed in form <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital. The main aim of this article is to find out the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity, which is required in sectors with different sensitivity to the economic cycle. Methodology/methods: There are used and analyzed secondary data for periods from I. 2007 to II. 2011, gotten from materials published by the Czech Statistical Office and the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade. The sector sensitivity is measured according to the correlation between gross domestic product (GDP), used for considering the economic cycle, and amount of sales reached on the sector, used for identifying the market life cycle. The <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> owner’s risk rewards is calculated with the use of the constructional model by the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade. Scientific aim: There is selected one cyclical, one neutral and one anti-cyclical, ever with the extreme value of the coefficient of correlation. By each of these three sectors there is calculated the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity to know shares of partial owner’s risk rewards. Findings: Highest values of all risk rewards are reached in the anti-cyclical sector. On the contrary there is reached the lowest value of risk reward to the size of the company (rLA) in the cyclical sector and of the risk reward to entrepreneurial risk (rPOD) in the neutral sector. The risk reward to financial stability (rFINSTAB) and to financial structure (rFINSTRU) were required in both sectors approximately on the same level. Conclusions: From the findings there can be derived, that investments in companies acting in anti-cyclical sectors is the most risky. But there are some limits, that follow from used methods. There were used data, that are valid only for czech sectors and only for selected periods. And furthermore, there isn’t considered the life cycle of companies, acting in selected sectors, and their market position, derived from corporate- and market life cycle...|$|R
