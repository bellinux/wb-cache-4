2500|$|In a talking-head interview, in {{the episode}} [...] "Tallahassee", Dwight {{talks about how}} first {{impressions}} last forever. He recalls that, when he first met Pam, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to him that [...] "slightly rubbed [...] the wrong way", and while he has since loved working with her, even stating that she is wonderful, due to that first impression, he hates her. In the episode [...] "The Whale", Dwight openly tells Pam that he considers her his friend. In the final episode of the series, Dwight refers to Pam as his best friend and ensures that she and Jim get a nice severance as they leave Dunder Mifflin.|$|E
60|$|He waited, as if {{he would}} have been glad that <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>something.</b> But she said never a word.|$|E
60|$|She {{wondered}} whether he meant Virginia, {{and whether he}} cared. Still further embarrassed, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> which she regretted immediately.|$|E
6000|$|Whitwell put {{his hand}} up and found that his {{daughter}} was right. He laughed, and said: [...] "I guess I must 'a' forgot it. We've had the most interestin' season with plantchette that I guess we've about ever had. <b>She's</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> here--" ...|$|R
60|$|Ellen knew Carey thought <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> very clever, but was all {{the more}} unconvinced.|$|R
60|$|Eda {{slipped from}} her father's knee {{and went to}} her mother, feeling and looking as if <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> wrong.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You didn't say {{she said}} that a minute ago, said Painted Jaguar, sucking the prickles out of his paddy-paw. 'You said <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> quite different.' ...|$|E
60|$|Hereat <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> so {{improper}} that it shocked even Binkie, who was dribbling patiently on {{the landing}} {{with the hope of}} seeing his master again.|$|E
60|$|He had {{a passionate}} desire {{to take her}} by the shoulders, but {{put his hand on}} hers instead, and she {{permitted}} it, like one disdainful but helpless. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> unimportant about the stillness.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Durgin's speech {{had been}} {{thickening}} more and more. <b>She</b> now <b>said</b> <b>something</b> that Jeff could not understand. He looked involuntarily at Cynthia.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Things are unfortunate enough already,' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> with <b>something</b> like Wilmet's dignity; 'but I {{should never}} forgive such hopeless ruin to dear Ferdinand's prospects.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Her uncle smiled, as if <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> peculiarly {{acceptable}} to him, and asked, hesitatingly, [...] "When {{you say you}} never did, you know, what is the full phrase?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Isabel {{certainly}} {{was unable to}} say she thought it; but presently <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> else. [...] "If you've not been requested by Lord Warburton to argue with me, then you're doing it disinterestedly--or {{for the love of}} argument." ...|$|E
60|$|But the {{momentary}} {{vision of a}} waistless woman with a shawl gathered {{over her head and}} shoulders at the back door attracted his attention. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to Mateo in Spanish, and the yellowish-white of Mateo's eyes glistened with intelligent comprehension.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, she didn't. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>something,</b> but not that. I don't {{suppose a}} man was ever so used before; and it's all Lord Chiltern;--just because I {{told him that he}} had no right to {{interfere}} with me. And he has no right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Katharine, you ARE in love!" [...] {{at which}} Katharine flushed, looked startled, as if <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> that <b>she</b> {{ought not to}} have said, and shook her head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you;--I won't go {{out again}} to-day." [...] This <b>she</b> <b>said</b> with <b>something</b> almost of crossness in her manner, and Mr. Kennedy {{went to the}} {{afternoon}} service by himself.|$|R
60|$|He {{shook hands}} kindly, but {{looked as if}} {{something}} did not please him. When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> amiss. He shook his head.|$|R
6000|$|PATTY. I {{think she}} was feared you would offer to her out of pity. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to Miss Susan about keeping a flag flying. What she meant I know not. (But he knows, and he turns away his face.) Are you laughing, sir? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{would do}} it," [...] added Mr. Truefitt, {{crossing}} {{to the window}} and staring out at the road {{with his back to the}} captain. [...] "And <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about a silver-plated butter-dish; but in the circumstances I said ’No.’ Miss Willett thought so too." ...|$|E
60|$|There it was again! Whenever he {{had succeeded}} in working himself up <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> which {{reminded}} him of the governess. She called him playfully a naughty boy when he did not sing his exercises to her satisfaction. This time he grew quite sulky.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> {{would have}} <b>said</b> <b>something</b> more, but was {{interrupted}} by the entrance of Juliette Marny into the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} else on your mind, Andrew, I know, but to-night we cannot talk any longer," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> in <b>something</b> resembling her old tone. [...] "Be very careful, dear. To-morrow--you will come to-morrow." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>She</b> also {{apparently}} <b>said</b> <b>something</b> {{to offend}} a young Bernard Shaw who, according to Lancelyn Green, [...] "hated her exceedingly".|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> {{like this}} to Beaton. He answered: [...] "You can meet the people I'm talking of very easily, {{if you want to}} take the trouble. It's what they came to New York for. I fancy it's the great {{ambition}} of their lives to be met." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; I {{found out}} that his name was White, a clerk or {{something}} in the marble works, {{and that he had}} a mother and sister living at Bellevue. I did see the sister when I went to get the marble girls into the G.F.S., but <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> foolish about her mother not liking it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't know me, Cecilia, or {{you would}} not say so. When I have {{made up my mind}} to a thing, I am {{generally}} firm about it. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about two years, and I will not say a word to alter that decision. If it be altered, it shall be altered by her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> with <b>something</b> like a sob, [...] "then {{you must}} go. But stand still a minute, Charley. I {{want to see}} if the clip I bought you in the Winnipeg gun-shop is working properly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all over. I knew {{it as soon}} as I saw {{her face}} when she came in. <b>She</b> has <b>said</b> <b>something,</b> or done something, and it's all off. It will be a matter of over twenty {{thousand}} pounds a year!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Lots of my mother’s {{people have}} been in the navy.” Lady Agatha {{perceived}} vaguely and good-naturedly that <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> the odd Americans thought odd and that she must justify herself. Something most unnatural was happening to her standard of oddity.|$|R
60|$|She {{fixed her}} black eyes {{steadily}} on him, her lips moved slightly, and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> in French. What it was, no one knew; but Legree's face became perfectly demoniacal in its expression, as she spoke; he half raised his hand, {{as if to}} strike,--a gesture which she regarded with fierce disdain, as she turned and walked away.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> {{to me in}} her low, liquid tones; but I {{could not}} {{understand}} her, and then she pointed toward the north and started away. I followed her, for my way was north too; but had it been south I still should have followed, so hungry was I for human companionship {{in this world of}} beasts and reptiles and half-men.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Tom; it's {{fine for}} you to talk that way, and it's fine to have Nellie on my side. But I don't {{understand}} this at all. If Grace has been going out with this Chester Waltham, why hasn't <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to me about it? She has spoken to me about Ada a number of times, but I never heard this Chester mentioned once." ...|$|E
60|$|She kissed him, {{and spoke}} very tenderly, nay affectionately, about Clara; but even she, even his mother, {{did not speak}} joyously; and <b>she</b> also <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about the {{difficulty}} of providing a maintenance for a married son. Then to her he burst forth, and spoke somewhat loudly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> with <b>something</b> like a sob in her voice, [...] "it were {{possible}} that you shouldn't do this." [...] She stopped abruptly, and I {{did not look at}} her, because I could feel the effort she was making to control herself.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Kendal looked serious, and Mr. Ferrars {{feared that}} the winter cares had so far told on her temper, that perplexity made her wilful in self-sacrifice. There was a pause, but just {{as she began to}} {{perceive}} <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> wrong, the lesser Maurice burst out in exultation, ...|$|R
