25|$|The Sperry AN/ASQ-42 bombing/navigation system {{combined}} {{a sophisticated}} {{inertial navigation system}} with the KS-39 <b>Star</b> <b>tracker</b> (astro-inertial navigation system) to provide heading reference, the AN/APN-113 Doppler radar to provide ground speed and windspeed data, a search radar to provide range data for bomb release and trajectory, and a radar altimeter. The AN/ASQ-42 {{was estimated to be}} 10 times more accurate than any previous bombing/navigation system.|$|E
25|$|Constructed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Voyager 2 {{included}} 16 hydrazine thrusters, three-axis stabilization, gyroscopes and celestial referencing instruments (Sun sensor/Canopus <b>Star</b> <b>Tracker)</b> {{to maintain}} pointing of the high-gain antenna toward Earth. Collectively these instruments {{are part of}} the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) along with redundant units of most instruments and 8 backup thrusters. The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects as it traveled through space.|$|E
50|$|Navigation is {{completely}} autonomous from Lunar Orbit to touchdown. Navigation updates come from TRN Laser altimetry and <b>star</b> <b>trackers</b> after deorbit burn. Deep space navigation relies on radiometric and <b>star</b> <b>trackers.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of CCDs to <b>star</b> <b>trackers</b> and <b>star</b> mappers is considered. Advantages {{and disadvantages of}} silicon CCD <b>star</b> <b>trackers</b> are {{compared with those of}} image dissector <b>star</b> <b>trackers.</b> It is concluded that the CCD has adequate sensitivity for most single star tracking tasks and is distinctly superior in multiple star tracking or mapping applications. The signal and noise figures of several current CCD configurations are discussed. The basic structure of the required signal processing is described, and it is shown that resolution in excess of the number of CCD elements may be had by interpolation...|$|R

25|$|Another {{important}} aspect of the Spacecraft Bus is the central computing, memory storage, and communications equipment. The processor and software direct data to and from the instruments, to the solid-state memory core, and to the radio system which can send data back to Earth and receive commands. The computer also controls the pointing and moment of the spacecraft, taking in sensor data from the gyroscopes and <b>star</b> <b>tracker,</b> and sending the necessary commands to the reaction wheels or thrusters depending.|$|E
2500|$|The GAM-77A {{version of}} the GAM-77 also {{included}} a new Kollsman Instruments KS-140 <b>star</b> <b>tracker</b> that was integrated with the N-6 inertial navigation system. This unit replaced the <b>star</b> <b>tracker</b> that had been located in the B-52's wing pylon. [...] The fuel capacity of the GAM-77A was increased during this upgrade. [...] A radar altimeter {{was added to the}} missile to provide (vertical) terrain-following radar capability to the Hound Dog. 428 Hound Dog missiles were upgraded to the GAM-77A configuration by North American.|$|E
2500|$|Although it was {{originally}} {{meant to be a}} [...] "quiet cruise" [...] phase, It soon became obvious that this [...] "cruise" [...] would be indeed very busy. There were <b>star</b> <b>Tracker</b> problems, a power wiring problem, extra manoeuvres, and on the 28th of October, the spacecraft was hit by one of the largest solar flares ever recorded.|$|E

2500|$|A {{derivative}} of the Navaho's NAA Autonetics Division N-6 {{inertial navigation system}} (INS), the N5G, {{was used in the}} Hound Dog. A Kollsman Instruments Co. <b>star</b> <b>tracker</b> located in the B-52's pylon was used to correct inertial navigation system orientation errors with celestial observations while the Hound Dog was being carried by the B-52. The INS could also be used to determine the bomber's position after the initial calibration and [...] "leveling" [...] process, which took about 90 minutes. The Hound Dog had a circular error probable (CEP) of , which was acceptable for a weapon equipped with a nuclear warhead.|$|E
2500|$|An {{acquisition}} Sun sensor, {{a cruise}} Sun sensor, a Canopus <b>star</b> <b>tracker</b> and an {{inertial reference unit}} consisting of six gyroscopes allowed three-axis stabilization. Two accelerometers were also on board. Communications were accomplished through a [...] S-band (2.3 GHz) transmitter and two [...] TWTAs. An X band [...] downlink was also added specifically for radio science and to conduct communications experiments. Uplink was via S band [...] A two-axis steerable parabolic dish antenna with a diameter of approximately 1.5 m was attached at one edge of the orbiter base, and a fixed low-gain antenna extended {{from the top of}} the bus. Two tape recorders were each capable of storing 1280 megabits. A 381-MHz relay radio was also available.|$|E
50|$|Another {{failure was}} {{the loss of}} the <b>star</b> <b>tracker.</b> The <b>star</b> <b>tracker</b> determines {{spacecraft}} orientation by comparing the star field to its internal charts. The mission was saved when the MICAS camera was reprogrammed to substitute for the <b>star</b> <b>tracker.</b> Although MICAS is more sensitive, its field-of-view is an order of magnitude smaller, creating a greater information processing burden. Ironically, the <b>star</b> <b>tracker</b> was an off-the-shelf component, expected to be highly reliable.|$|E

50|$|On 25 April 1998, {{failure of}} the primary <b>star</b> <b>tracker</b> on the X-ray Telescope led to {{pointing}} errors that in turn had caused solar overheating. A contingency plan and the necessary software had already been developed to utilise an alternative <b>star</b> <b>tracker</b> attached to the Wide Field Camera.|$|E
50|$|A <b>star</b> <b>tracker</b> is {{an optical}} device that {{measures}} {{the positions of}} stars using photocells or a camera.As the positions of many stars have been measured by astronomers to {{a high degree of}} accuracy, a <b>star</b> <b>tracker</b> on a satellite or spacecraft may be used to determine the orientation (or attitude) of the spacecraft with respect to the stars. In order to do this, the <b>star</b> <b>tracker</b> must obtain an image of the stars, measure their apparent position in the reference frame of the spacecraft, and identify the stars so their position can be compared with their known absolute position from a star catalog. A <b>star</b> <b>tracker</b> may include a processor to identify stars by comparing the pattern of observed stars with the known pattern of stars in the sky.|$|E

50|$|By mid-April, the {{electronics}} {{in the main}} spacecraft had completely failed and all signal transmission ceased, however communication via the lander could still be performed and space radiation and atomic-hydrogen spectrometer measurements were received. The <b>star</b> <b>trackers</b> in the spacecraft were also used to align it for a course-correction burn, but the second one was off by 65 feet per second (20 meters per second). Also one of the <b>star</b> <b>trackers</b> failed, forcing ground controllers to place Zond 1 into a spin-stabilization mode. However, all communications had failed by May 14. It passed 100,000 km from Venus on July 14, 1964.|$|R

40|$|Compared with {{traditional}} <b>star</b> <b>trackers,</b> intensified high-accuracy <b>star</b> <b>trackers</b> {{equipped with an}} image intensifier exhibit overwhelmingly superior dynamic performance. However, the multiple-fiber-optic faceplate structure in the image intensifier complicates the optoelectronic detecting system of <b>star</b> <b>trackers</b> and may cause considerable systematic centroid errors and poor attitude accuracy. All the sources of systematic centroid errors related to fiber optic faceplates (FOFPs) throughout the detection process of the optoelectronic system were analyzed. Based on the general expression of the systematic centroid error deduced in the frequency domain and the FOFP modulation transfer function, an accurate expression that described the systematic centroid error of FOFPs was obtained. Furthermore, reduction of the systematic error between the optical lens and the input FOFP of the intensifier, the one among multiple FOFPs and the one between the output FOFP of the intensifier and the imaging chip of the detecting system were discussed. Two important parametric constraints were acquired from the analysis. The correctness of the analysis on the optoelectronic detecting system was demonstrated through simulation and experiment...|$|R

It consisted of Sun and Earth sensors, the before-mentioned <b>star</b> <b>trackers,</b> a quadrant <b>star</b> sensor on the telescope axis, gyroscopes and reaction wheels. A complementary reaction control system (RCS), using hydrazine propellant, was responsible for orbital direction and finetuning shortly after launch. The complete satellite weighed just under 2500 kg, was 5.3 m high, 3.6 m wide and measured 2.3 m in depth.|$|R
40|$|Following gyro {{failures}} in April 2001 and April 2003, HST Pointing Control System engineers designed reduced-gyro control laws {{to extend the}} spacecraft science mission. The Two-Gyro Science (TGS) and One-Gyro Science (OGS) control laws were designed and implemented using magnetometers, <b>star</b> <b>trackers,</b> and Fine Guidance Sensors in succession to control vehicle rate about the missing gyro axes. Both TGS and OGS have demonstrated on-orbit pointing stability of 7 milli-arcseconds or less, which depends upon the guide star magnitude used by the Fine Guidance Sensor.
