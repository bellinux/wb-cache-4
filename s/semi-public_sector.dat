This trend is in sharp contrast to what occurred {{at the turn of the}} 21 st century when employees the government and state-owned enterprises were found to enjoy a privileged situation.

The possible threats to K-anonymity approach {{is described in}} detail. Particularly, the problems related to data and the approaches are identified to combine K-anonymity in data mining. Nergiz et al. (2009) improved and extended the definitions of K-anonymity to manifold relations definitions of K-anonymity expression. It is shown that earlier developed techniques either failed to secure privacy or as a whole reduced the data utilization, and data protection in a multiple relations setting. A new clustering algorithms is introduced to obtain multi-relational anonymity. Experimental results illustrated that the proposed technique is an effective approach in terms of utility and efficiency. Support for arbitrary schemes with multiple private entities must be considered.|$|R

We find that earnings gaps across ownership have been reducing during this period and that the convergence trend has been {{in favor of the}} private and <b>semi-public</b> <b>sectors</b> as opposed to the public sector. This is in sharp contrast to what occurred {{at the turn of the}} century, when employees of public administration and enterprises were found to enjoy a very much privileged situation. On the one hand, differences in endowments are found to play a growing role in explaining earnings differentials. On the other hand, although starting to become less an issue, segmentation across ownership remains important, especially for high-wage earners. Key words: labor market, earnings differentials, segmentation, enterprise ownership, China. Three decades of economic reform have brought tremendous changes in every sector of China’s economy. The labor market is no exception, and it has been particularly affected by important policy and institutional changes at the turn of the century. On the one hand, the state sector reform wa...|$|R
30|$|For Europe it is {{important}} to recognize that these changes in private sector labor market demand were accompanied by the expansion of the (<b>semi-)public</b> <b>sector,</b> which is far more higher education-intensive than the private sector. This contributed to a market scarcity for higher-educated workers in the private sector, adding to the upward pressure on wages of well-trained workers, while the public sector wages follow the private sector’s wage-setting. In other words, the disequalizing wage effect of the technologic change, which enhanced the relative demand for well-trained workers, was enhanced by the expansion of the (<b>semi-)public</b> <b>sector</b> in Europe. It was further enhanced by the emulation on bonuses and top earnings in the private sector.|$|E
30|$|The (<b>semi-)public</b> <b>sector</b> {{accounted}} {{for more than half of}} the employment growth in the first decade of the 21 st century. The private sector showed strong growth in the distribution and transport sectors, as well as in business and other services. Contrarily, the primary sector, utilities and manufacturing showed substantial job losses. The construction sector grew slightly in the number of jobs (some additional 1 million jobs).|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{shows that}} Dutch {{political}} parties are {{actively engaged in}} influencing appointments in the public and <b>semi-public</b> <b>sector.</b> This {{can be explained by}} the Dutch tradition of consensus and coalition governments. Political parties are used to sharing power, and sharing appointments is part of that system. There is an (informal) system of distribution of appointments between political parties. Political parties have geared their party organization to this end. In the Dutch tradition, this system of distribution is considered to neutralize political differences and competition rather than to increase political power or reward active party members, which probably explains why (party) patronage has so far been assumed to be absent in the Netherlands...|$|E

40|$|Belgium {{has evolved}} into a federal State. There are three Regions endowed with competences in social and {{economic}} matters: The Flemish Region, the Walloon region and the Region of Brussels – Capital. The Regions have a well-defined territory that is under their jurisdiction. Furthermore, there are three communities: the Flemish Community, the French Community and the German speaking Community. These communities have competences in cultural matters and in n matters of well being and personal development. It {{is important to note that}} the communities have no well defined territory as such, seen the fact that some parts of the country have a bilingual status. These remarks on Belgian federalism are important, while the federal structure has an influence on industrial relations. Labour law and also social security law constitute a competence of the federal authorities. Since the regions are competent to develop an employment policy in their own right, it is easily understood that friction and tensions are possible.

40|$|Deforestation, {{habitat loss}} and forest {{degradation}} {{are the most}} critical issues facing Malawi today driven by higher population growth. Deforestation in water catchments has a direct link to the blackouts of the state-owned power producing company (Electricity Supply Commission of Malawi, ESCOM) and to the inadequate water supply by the semi-public Water Boards, both in dry and wet seasons due to sedimentation and low flows in the rivers. As a result, water and power utilities, private sector and communities are all severely affected by the impacts of deforestation. To solve deforestation in Malawi, the country requires a multi-sectoral integrated approach through creation of smart partnerships between public, <b>semi-public</b> and private <b>sectors</b> to support community-based afforestation and forest regeneration programmes. It is proposed that Malawi Reforestation and Environmental Protection Authority (MAREPA) be established through an Act of Parliament to collect funds and finance afforestation and forest regeneration activities. A small non-prohibitive tax (administrative levy) on selected key products, such as water, beer, electricity, sugar, tea, coffee, and tobacco, could be introduced to finance the MAREPA fund. This will be achieved through Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES), where a smart partnership among government, semi-public water and power utilities, private sector, development partners, an...|$|R
