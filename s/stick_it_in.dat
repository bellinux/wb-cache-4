500|$|Although {{he was a}} striker, Dickov {{was better}} known for his {{tenacity}} than his goal-scoring exploits. In a 2003 interview with the Independent on Sunday he provided a summary of his playing style: [...] "The ability to battle {{is one of the}} main parts of my game. I know my limits. I am not the sort who gets the ball and is then going to beat five or six players and <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the top corner from God knows where. But, whether I'm playing well or not, the one thing you will get from me is 110 per cent, upsetting defenders and basically giving them pain." [...] Rio Ferdinand was mentioning his name as the biggest headache to deal with on the pitch. His combative approach resulted in Manchester City manager Joe Royle naming him [...] "The Wasp", and during his time at Leicester he was known as [...] "The Pest".|$|E
500|$|At about dawn on October 26, {{the card}} game broke up and Behan and Virgil Earp {{went home to}} bed. Ike Clanton testified later he saw Virgil take his six-shooter out of his lap and <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his pants when the game ended. Not having rented a room, Tom McLaury and Ike Clanton {{had no place to}} go. Shortly after 8:00 am barkeeper E. F. Boyle spoke to Ike Clanton in front of the {{telegraph}} office. Clanton had been drinking all night and Boyle encouraged him to get some sleep, but Ike insisted he would not go to bed. Boyle later testified he noticed Ike was armed and covered his gun for him. Boyle later said that Ike told him, [...] "'As soon as the Earps and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street, the ball would open—that they would have to fight'...I went down to Wyatt Earp's house and told him that Ike Clanton had threatened that when him and his brothers and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street that the ball would open." [...] Ike said in his testimony afterward that he remembered neither meeting Boyle nor making any such statements that day.|$|E

2500|$|The lyrics on {{the record}} were {{described}} by the band members as [...] "a collaborative psycho-therapy session wherein personal demons of various sizes and importance are exorcised, vilified, taken revenge upon and laid to rest." [...] Vig said they tried to deal with [...] "dark themes that I {{think a lot of}} people can relate to in some way or another", which included voyeurism, hedonism, perversion, obsession and [...] "the art of self-destruction." [...] Manson stated that even though she put together most of the songs, [...] "everybody has ideas that come to the table and I just use what I fancy. When we're working on something, the lyrics take a while to work on and [...] come to me and say 'I've had these ideas, use them if you want' and if there's something I like, I'll <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> with my own, or vice-versa. Some people come in going 'I've got this great title for a song' and I might use that." [...] Manson remarked that while the content was [...] "a lot more poppy" [...] than most of her previous work, the songs invoked the dark side of her nature, as [...] "sometimes I'm a bit wee creepy, and that definitely comes out in the music." [...] She also declared that music [...] "unlocks sensations and feelings that you keep inside, that society doesn't allow you to show", saying that the gist of a mean-spirited song like [...] "Vow" [...] is very real despite [...] "none of us hav ever really acted on those feelings". Vig added that the band was eager to exploit the contrast between words and music: [...] "The initial idea was to make this a dark lyric with a shiny, happy, pop sensibility. You could be singing this really catchy line and realize the lyrics were totally wacked." ...|$|E

60|$|Joe shuddered as {{he leaned}} {{over one of the}} dusky forms to detach powder and bullet horn. He had never seen a dead Indian, and the tense face, the sightless, vacant eyes made him shrink. He shuddered again when he saw the hunter scalp his victims. He shuddered the third time when he saw Wetzel pick up Silvertip's {{beautiful}} white eagle plume, dabble it in a pool of blood, and <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the bark of a tree. Bereft of its graceful beauty, drooping with its gory burden, the long leather was a deadly message. It had been Silvertip's pride; it was now a challenge, a menace to the Shawnee chief.|$|E

6000|$|We {{went down}} to a little public square {{in front of the}} town, where there was a splendid diving-place. A good many people were strolling about there, but I don't suppose that a single person who saw those darkey fellows, with nothing on but their cotton trousers,--who stood in a line {{on the edge of the}} sea-wall, and plunged in, head foremost, like a lot of frogs, when I threw out a couple of [...] "big coppers,"--ever {{supposed}} that these rascals were diving for monarchical purposes. The water was so clear that we could see them down at the bottom, swimming and paddling around after the coppers. When a fellow found one he'd <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his mouth, and come up as lively as a cricket, and all ready for another scramble at the bottom.|$|E

Sylvester next disguises himself as Red's fairy godmother, attempting to electrocute Red with a rigged wand. Sylvester's incantation is [...] "R-A-G-G M-O-P-P" [...] {{in reference to the}} 1950 pop song Rag Mop by The Ames Brothers. However, Hector unplugs the power so that it doesn't work. Sylvester wonders if the wand is faulty ("What's this? Must've blown a fuse or somethin'") but Red simply tells him that nothing had happened ("It's a fake; nothing happens").

60|$|Pacific Fleury, {{it must be}} owned, if {{he wanted}} a quarrel with the Kaiser, could not have managed it on more {{advantageous}} terms. Generals, a Duc de Berwick, a Noailles, Belleisle; generals, troops, artillery, munitions, nothing is wanting to Fleury; to the Kaiser all things. It is surmised, the French had their eye on Lorraine, not on Stanislaus, from the first. For many centuries, especially for these last two,--ever since that Siege of Metz, which we once saw, under Kaiser Karl V. and Albert Alcibiades,--France has been wrenching and screwing at this Lorraine, wriggling it off bit by bit; till now, as we perceived on Lyttelton junior of Hagley's visit, Lorraine seems all lying unscrewed; and France, by any good opportunity, could <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> her pocket. Such opportunity sly Fleury contrived, they say;--or more likely it might be Belleisle and the other adventurous spirits that urged it on pacific Fleury;--but, at all events, he has got it. Dilapidated Kehl yields straightway: [29th October, 1733. Memoires du Marechal de Berwick (in Petitot'e Collection, Paris, 1828), ii. 303.] Sardinia, Spain, declare alliance with Fleury; and not Lorraine only, and the Swabian Provinces, but Italy itself lies at his discretion,--owing to your treatment of the Grandfather of France, and these Polish Elective methods.|$|E
60|$|It is {{a marked}} {{characteristic}} of the cactus tribe to be very tenacious of life, and when hacked to pieces, to spring afresh in full vigour from every scrap or fragment. True vegetable hydras, when you cut down one, ten spring in its place: every separate morsel of the thick and succulent stem has the power of growing anew into a separate cactus. Surprising as this peculiarity seems at first sight, {{it is only a}} special desert modification of a faculty possessed in a less degree by almost all plants and by many animals. If you cut off the end of a rose branch and <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the ground under suitable conditions, it grows into a rose tree. If you take cuttings of scarlet geraniums or common verbenas, and pot them in moist soil, they bud out apace into new plants like their parents. Certain special types can even be propagated from fragments of the leaf; for example, there is a particularly vivacious begonia off which you may snap a corner of one blade, and hang it up by a string from a peg or the ceiling, when, hi, presto! little begonia plants begin to bud out incontinently on every side from its edges. A certain German professor went even further than that; he chopped up a liverwort very fine into vegetable mincemeat, which he then spread thin over a saucerful of moist sand, and lo! in a few days the whole surface of the mess was covered with a perfect forest of sprouting little liverworts. Roughly speaking, one may say that every fragment of every organism has in it the power to rebuild in its entirety another organism like the one of which it once formed a component element.|$|E
60|$|At eleven o'clock, Mr. Barton walked {{forth in}} cape and boa, with the sleet driving in his face, to read prayers at the workhouse, euphemistically called the 'College'. The College {{was a huge}} square stone building, {{standing}} on the best apology for an elevation of ground {{that could be seen}} for about ten miles around Shepperton. A flat ugly district this; depressing enough to look at even on the brightest days. The roads are black with coal-dust, the brick houses dingy with smoke; and at that time--the time of handloom weavers--every other cottage had a loom at its window, where you might see a pale, sickly-looking man or woman pressing a narrow chest against a board, and doing a sort of treadmill work with legs and arms. A troublesome district for a clergyman; at least to one who, like Amos Barton, understood the 'cure of souls' in something more than an official sense; for over and above the rustic stupidity furnished by the farm-labourers, the miners brought obstreperous animalism, and the weavers in an acrid Radicalism and Dissent. Indeed, Mrs. Hackit often observed that the colliers, who many of them earned better wages than Mr. Barton, 'passed their time in doing nothing but swilling ale and smoking, like the beasts that perish' (speaking, we may presume, in a remotely analogical sense); and in some of the alehouse corners the drink was flavoured by a dingy kind of infidelity, something like rinsings of Tom Paine in ditch-water. A certain amount of religious excitement created by the popular preaching of Mr. Parry, Amos's predecessor, had nearly died out, and the religious life of Shepperton was falling back towards low-water mark. Here, you perceive, was a terrible stronghold of Satan; and you may well pity the Rev. Amos Barton, who had to stand single-handed and summon it to surrender. We read, indeed, that the walls of Jericho fell down before the sound of trumpets; but we nowhere hear that those trumpets were hoarse and feeble. Doubtless they were trumpets that gave forth clear ringing tones, and sent a mighty vibration through brick and mortar. But the oratory of the Rev. Amos resembled rather a Belgian railway-horn, which shows praiseworthy intentions inadequately fulfilled. He often missed the right note both in public and private exhortation, and got a little angry in consequence. For though Amos thought himself strong, he did not feel himself strong. Nature had given him the opinion, but not the sensation. Without that opinion he would probably never have worn cambric bands, but would have been an excellent cabinetmaker and deacon of an Independent church, as his father was before him (he was not a shoemaker, as Mr. Pilgrim had reported). He might then have sniffed long and loud {{in the corner of his}} pew in Gun Street Chapel; he might have indulged in halting rhetoric at prayer-meetings, and have spoken faulty English in private life; and these little infirmities would not have prevented him, honest faithful man that he was, from being a shining light in the dissenting circle of Bridgeport. A tallow dip, of the long-eight description, is an excellent thing in the kitchen candlestick, and Betty's nose and eye are not sensitive to the difference between it and the finest wax; it is only when you <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the silver candlestick, and introduce it into the drawing-room, that it seems plebeian, dim, and ineffectual. Alas for the worthy man who, like that candle, gets himself into the wrong place! It is only the very largest souls who will be able to appreciate and pity him--who will discern and love sincerity of purpose amid all the bungling feebleness of achievement.|$|E

When there, Lisa has Willie realize that his life could be much better, and she decides to turn him into a proper gentleman. Bart, however, does not believe that she can do it, but Lisa bets that she can in time for the school science fair.|$|R
