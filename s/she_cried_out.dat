2500|$|Years later, Balvina's brother/Anjelica's cousin, Conrado Juarez, {{admitted}} to torturing, raping and sodomizing the child before smothering her. Juarez, who was 30 {{years old at}} the time of the murder, had bound Anjelica to a table in his sister's apartment and deprived her of water on multiple occasions. Juarez claimed he originally did not intend to kill her but then suffocated her with a pillow after <b>she</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> during her rape. [...] Juarez immediately informed Juarez-Ramirez that their cousin was dead, and his sister insisted that they dispose of the body. Anjelica's body was placed in a cooler, and the siblings took a car service to Manhattan to dump the cooler.|$|E
2500|$|Catherine Gordon {{was taught}} to read {{at a young age}} and had a passion for literature, a passion she shared with her son. Byron would read through the Bible, {{focusing}} predominantly on the Old Testament, and he would also read works dealing with history or narrative tales like the Arabian Nights. However this passion for reading was not the only passion mother and child shared; Catherine was also known for having a violent temper. The son inherited his mother's temper but he would not speak while he experienced various fits. On one occasion, the young Byron bit off a piece of a china saucer during his [...] "silent rage". Byron's problems were compounded by his mother's lack of money, especially with her having to provide for her delinquent husband. When word reached her that John Byron had died, <b>she</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> loud enough for her neighbourhood to hear. However, her troubles were not over, for in his final moments John Byron had incurred even more debt, which burdened his widow to the point of having to move to another home in worse conditions.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} several {{references}} to necromancers – called [...] "bone-conjurers" [...] among Jews {{of the later}} Hellenistic period – in the Bible. The Book of Deuteronomy (...) explicitly warns the Israelites against engaging in the Canaanite practice of divination from the dead: [...] Though Mosaic Law prescribed the death penalty to practitioners of necromancy (...) , this warning was not always heeded. One of the foremost examples is when King Saul had the Witch of Endor invoke the Spirit of Samuel, a judge and prophet, from Sheol using a ritual conjuring pit (...) [...] [...] However, the so-called witch was shocked at {{the presence of the}} real spirit of Samuel for in I Sam 28:12 it says, [...] "when the woman saw Samuel, <b>she</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> in a loud voice." [...] Samuel questioned his reawakening asking, [...] "Why hast thou disquieted me?" [...] Saul did not receive a death penalty (his being the highest authority in the land) but he did receive it from God himself as prophesied by Samuel during that conjuration.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Judah {{explained}} {{the words of}} [...] "her cry {{that has come to}} Me." [...] Noting that [...] does not say [...] "their cry" [...] but [...] "her cry," [...] Rabbi Judah told that the people of Sodom issued a proclamation that anyone who gave a loaf of bread to the poor or needy would be burned. Lot's daughter Pelotit, the wife of a magnate of Sodom, saw a poor man on the street, and was moved with compassion. Every day when she went out to draw water, she smuggled all kinds of provisions to him from her house in her pitcher. The men of Sodom questioned how the poor man could survive. When they found out, they brought Pelotit out to be burned. <b>She</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> to God to maintain her cause, and her cry ascended before the Throne of Glory. And God said (in the words of [...] ) [...] "I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to her cry that has come to Me." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Exodus, the law forbidding {{adultery}} was codified for {{the nation}} of Israel at Mount Sinai. [...] It {{was one of the}} Ten Commandments written by the finger of God on stone tablets. Details regarding the administration of the law and additional boundaries on sexual behavior followed. [...] For example, an ordeal was established to prove the guilt or innocence of a wife whose husband suspected her of adultery. [...] Adultery was a capital crime, and if adulterers were caught, at least two witnesses were required before the death penalty would be carried out. [...] Since men were permitted to have multiple wives, adultery was interpreted to consist of sexual relations {{between a man and a}} married or betrothed woman who was not his wife. A man who had sexual relations with a woman who was not married or betrothed was not guilty of adultery, per se, but the man was then obligated to marry the woman, unless her father forbid it. Other boundaries on sexual behavior included the prohibition of sexual relations between close relatives, between persons of the same sex, and between people and animals; prostitution was also forbidden. [...] The prohibition of prostitution has been interpreted by rabbinical scholars to preclude sexual relations outside of marriage in general, and a woman who, after getting married, was found to have been promiscuous before marriage faced the death penalty. A woman who was raped was not guilty of breaking the law, provided <b>she</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> for help (which was taken as proof that she did not consent). [...] According to Deuteronomy, the commandment against adultery was reaffirmed as the leadership of Israel passed from Moses to Joshua.|$|E
