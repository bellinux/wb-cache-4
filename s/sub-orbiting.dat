The object was launched on a 32 deg inclination south east path to a high <b>sub-orbit</b> altitude of more than 18,600 miles.

40|$|Every {{action of}} a group on a set {{decomposes}} the set into orbits. The group acts {{on each of the}} orbits and an orbit does not have <b>sub-orbits</b> (unequal orbits are disjoint), so the decomposition of a set into orbits could be considered as a “factorization ” of the set into “irreducible ” pieces for the group action. Our focus here is on these irreducible parts...|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of complex Hadamard {{matrices}} of order 9 are constructed. The studied matrices are symmetric, block circulant with circulant blocks ($BCCB$) and form an until now unknown non-reducible and non-affine two-parameter orbit. Several suborbits are identified, including a one-parameter intersection with the Fourier orbit $F_{ 9 }^{(4) }$. The defect of this {{new type of}} Hadamard matrices is observed to vary, from a generic value 2 to the anomalous values 4 and 10 for some <b>sub-orbits,</b> and to 12 and 16 for some single matrices. The latter matrices are shown {{to be related to}} complete sets of MUBs in dimension 9. Comment: 14 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|To reduce {{operations}} cost, the RLV {{must include}} the following elements: highly reliable, robust subsystems designed for simple repair access with a simplified servicing infrastructure and incorporating expedited decision making about faults and anomalies. A key component for the Single Stage to Orbit (SSTO) RLV System used to meet these objectives is System Health Management (SHM). SHM deals with the vehicle component- Vehicle Health Management (VHM), the ground processing associated with the fleet (GVHM) and the Ground Infrastructure Health Management (GIHM). The objective is to provide an automated collection and paperless health decision, maintenance and logistics system. Many critical technologies are necessary to make the SHM (and more specifically VHM) practical, reliable and cost effective. Sanders is leading the design, development and integration of the SHM system for RLV and X- 33 SHM (a sub-scale, <b>sub-orbit</b> Advanced Technology Demonstrator). This paper will present the X- 33 SHM design which forms the baseline for RLV SHM. This paper will also discuss other applications of these technologies...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the multiplicity of}} stellar systems with (combined) magnitude brighter than 6. 00 in Hipparcos magnitudes. We identify 4559 such bright systems (including the Sun), and the frequencies of multiplicities 1, 2, [...] ., 7 {{are found to be}} 2718, 1437, 285, 86, 20, 11 and 2. We discuss the uncertainties, which are substantial. We also {{consider the}} distributions of periods of orbits and <b>sub-orbits.</b> We note that for the even more restricted set of 478 systems with V_H <= 4. 00 the proportions of higher multiples up to sextuple are progressively larger (213, 179, 54, 19, 8, 5), suggesting substantial incompleteness in even the reasonably well-studied larger sample. This sample can be seen as relatively thoroughly studied for multiplicity, and reasonably representative of stars more massive than the Sun. But the restriction to V_H <= 6 means that our sample contains hardly any systems where all components are low-mass main-sequence stars (K or M). Data on multiplicity is important as a constraint on (a) the star-formation problem, (b) the problem of the evolution of the Galactic stellar population, and (c) the interaction of dynamics and evolution through the effect of Kozai cycles. We discuss these topics briefly. Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS 11 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables: [URL] [URL] [URL]...|$|R
50|$|Agni {{is unlike}} {{long-range}} missiles developed by western missiles where the RV is a passive ballistic load, whose accuracy {{depends on the}} launching vehicle's exact insertion into the sub-orbital trajectory. A large inaccuracy associated with the first generation RV involved spinning the RV for greater stability during re-entry. Second generation western missiles were mostly MIRV (Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle) and the accuracy was greatly improved by the payload bus with HAM velocity correction package for more accurate <b>sub-orbit</b> insertion. It also allowed individual MIRV payloads to impart different velocities, so that each can be independently targeted to a different target, albeit in nearby vicinity of each other. As before, the RV continued to be passive and purely ballistic. The Agni-RV Mk 2 is more advanced than the western RVs, because it embodies proposition, navigation and control {{all the way to}} the target. The RV re-enters at an altitude of 100 km, at a shallow angle, with a gliding trajectory. However it does not carry a MIRV payload, which is not to be intended to mean that India does not have the technology: the country launched and accurately placed ten satellites in a single launch in 2007, on its PSLV space vehicle, which was the first evidence of the country having revealed its expertise in this arena.|$|R

In addition, this paper will describe a Virtual Design Environment (VDE) which is being developed for RLV. This VDE will allow for system design engineering, as well as program management teams, to accurately and efficiently evaluate system designs, analyze the behavior of current systems, and predict the feasibility of making smooth and cost-efficient transitions from older technologies to newer ones. The RLV SHM design methodology will reduce program costs, decrease total program life-cycle time, and ultimately increase mission success...|$|R
40|$|When decomposing {{the total}} orbit into $N$ <b>sub-orbits</b> (or simply orbits) {{related to each}} of $N$ servers and through {{comparing}} the numbers of customers in these orbits, we introduce a retrial supermarket model of $N$ identical servers, where two probing-server choice numbers are respectively designed for dynamically allocating each primary arrival and each retrial arrival into these orbits when the chosen servers are all busy. Note that the designed purpose of the two choice numbers can effectively improve performance measures of this retrial supermarket model. This paper analyzes a simple and basic retrial supermarket model of N identical servers, that is, Poisson arrivals, exponential service and retrial times. To this end, we first provide a detailed probability computation {{to set up an}} infinite-dimensional system of differential equations (or mean-field equations) satisfied by the expected fraction vector. Then, as N goes to infinity, we apply the operator semigroup to obtaining the mean-field limit (or chaos of propagation) for the sequence of Markov processes which express the state of this retrial supermarket model. Specifically, some simple and basic conditions for the mean-field limit {{as well as for the}} Lipschitz condition are established through the first two moments of the queue length in any orbit. Finally, we show that the fixed point satisfies a system of nonlinear equations which is an interesting networking generalization of the tail equations given in the M/M/ 1 retrial queue, and also use the fixed point to give performance analysis of this retrial supermarket model through numerical computation.
