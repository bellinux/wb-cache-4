Although West Virginia was correct in observing that improvements were outside its boundaries, he wrote, the improvements were financed by state bonds and purchases of stock in corporations making the improvements.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a 3 GPP-compliant {{distributed}} paging mechanism over the X 2 interface for all-wireless Networks of Small Cells (NoS). An all-wireless NoS is a wireless mesh network that provides multi-hop connectivity amongst small cells, as well as access to functional entities in the mobile operator's core network. The standard 3 GPP paging procedure has been designed with traditional macrocell scenarios in mind. This raises scalability and network congestion issues in large-scale deployments of all-wireless NoS, where paging messages need to traverse a large number of small cells in order to reach the destination mobile terminal.

A recent European initiative proposes further ambitious reforms. Besides a better consumer protection, the European deposit guarantee schemes would be largely harmonised, thus also promoting European financial integration. Risk-weighted financing of the schemes should counteract moral hazard, benefiting financial stability. However, this proposal has yet to be approved by the European Parliament and the Council.
