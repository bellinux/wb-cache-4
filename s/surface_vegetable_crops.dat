40|$|AbstractFuture <b>vegetable</b> <b>crop</b> {{production}} {{might be}} affected by Climate Change with the projected increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentration and changes in precipitation pattern. Elevated CO 2 as one main component of photosynthesis is assumed to increase the yield of many crops while alleviating negative effects of drought stress and, thereby, increasing the water use efficiency. However, the responses of field grown <b>vegetable</b> <b>crops</b> to elevated CO 2 are still unknown as previous findings are mainly derived from experiments conducted under controlled environments. In addition, the field vegetable production is characterized by several sets per season, varying growth conditions during the production periods and a high water demand usually provided by an irrigation system. Moreover, <b>vegetable</b> <b>crops</b> differ in the harvest organs, e. g. fruits, root tuber, bulbs or leaves, which are predominantly harvested in an early development stage. These vegetable-specific aspects have not been considered in past Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiments. Therefore, we aim at analyzing the short and long impacts of elevated CO 2 with limited water supply on field <b>vegetable</b> <b>crop</b> productivity for three different crops (Cucumis sativus L., Raphanus sativus var. sativius L., Spinacia oleracea L.). Here, we present the methodological framework. Experiments will be conducted in the newly established FACE facility for <b>vegetable</b> <b>crops</b> at Geisenheim University, Germany. The facility is designed to raise the ambient CO 2 concentration at the experimental field site by about 20 % to approximately 480 ppm and to regulate the water supply with a drip irrigation system, resulting in a split plot design with three replications. In each replication an annual crop rotation with several production cycles of the three different <b>vegetable</b> <b>crops</b> are realized.
