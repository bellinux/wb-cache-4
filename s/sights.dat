5|$|Many reticle {{illumination}} {{and pattern}} options are available. Common light sources used in firearm reflector <b>sights</b> include battery powered lights, fiber optic light collectors, and even tritium capsules. Some <b>sights</b> {{are specifically designed}} to be visible when viewed through night vision devices. The color of a sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some <b>sights</b> use a chevron or triangular pattern instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide selectable patterns.|$|E

5|$|Reflector <b>sights</b> {{were invented}} as an {{improved}} gun-sight and since their invention {{they have been}} adapted to many types of weapons. When used with different types of guns, reflector <b>sights</b> are considered an improvement over simple iron <b>sights</b> (<b>sights</b> composed of two spaced metal aiming points {{that have to be}} aligned). Iron <b>sights</b> take considerable experience and skill in the user who has to hold a proper eye position and focus exclusively on the front sight, keeping it centered on the (unfocused) rear sight, while keeping the whole centered on a target at different distances, requiring alignment of all three planes of focus to achieve a hit. The reflector sight's single, parallax-free virtual image, in focus with the target, removes this aiming problem, helping poor, average, and expert shooters alike.|$|E

5|$|Holographic weapon <b>sights</b> {{are similar}} in layout to {{reflector}} <b>sights</b> but do not use a projected reticle system. Instead, a representative reticle is recorded in three-dimensional space onto holographic film {{at the time of}} manufacture. This image is part of the optical viewing window. The recorded hologram is illuminated by a collimated laser built into the sight. The sight can be adjusted for range and windage by simply tilting or pivoting the optical window.|$|E

5|$|Reflector <b>sights</b> as {{aircraft}} gun-sights {{have many}} advantages. The pilot/gunner need not position their head to align the sight line precisely {{as they did}} in two-point mechanical <b>sights,</b> head position is only limited to that determined by the optics in the collimator, mostly by the diameter of the collimator lens. The sight does not interfere with the overall view, particularly when the collimator light is turned off. Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting.|$|E
5|$|Since their {{invention}} in 1900, reflector <b>sights</b> {{have come}} to be used as gun <b>sights</b> on all kinds of weapons. They were used on fighter aircraft, in a limited capacity in World War I, widely used in World War II, and still used as the base component in many types of modern head-up displays. They have been used in other types of (usually large) weapons as well, such as anti-aircraft gun <b>sights,</b> anti tank gun <b>sights,</b> and any other role where the operator had to engage fast moving targets over a wide field of view, and the sight itself could be supplied with sufficient electrical power to function. There was some limited use of the sight on small arms after World War II but it came into widespread use after the late 1970s with the invention of the red dot sight, with a red light-emitting diode (LED) as its reticle, making a dependable sight with durability and extremely long illumination run time.|$|E
5000|$|Mr. Patridge's <b>sighting</b> {{system has}} become a {{standard}} for many American handguns. His arrangement replaced the thinner front blade <b>sight</b> coupled with a u-notch rear <b>sight</b> that many earlier revolvers employed {{in favor of a}} front post <b>sight</b> with parallel vertical sides and a flat top and a rear <b>sight</b> with a rectangular rear notch. The walls of the rear <b>sight</b> are parallel {{to each other and to}} those of the blade providing a superior <b>sight</b> picture to the older <b>sighting</b> system.

However, the most used additional <b>sight</b> for Beryl is EOTech 552 holographic weapon <b>sight</b> and PCS-5M passive night <b>sight.</b> PCS-6 and CWL-1 are introduced in small number.|$|R

5|$|The British Army's basic {{infantry}} {{weapon is}} the L85A2 assault rifle, sometimes {{equipped with an}} L17A2 under-barrel grenade launcher or other attachments with the Picatinny rail. The rifle has several variants, including the L86A2, the Light Support Weapon (LSW) and the L22A2 carbine (issued to tank crews). These weapons are usually equipped with iron <b>sights</b> or an optical SUSAT, although optical <b>sights</b> have been purchased to supplement these.|$|E
5|$|The viewing {{portion of}} a {{reflector}} sight does not use any refractive optical elements, {{it is simply a}} projected reticle bounced off a beam splitter or curved mirror right into the users eye. This gives it the defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use, as opposed to simple mechanical <b>sights</b> such as iron <b>sights.</b> A reflector sight also does not have the field of view and eye relief problems of <b>sights</b> based on optical telescopes: depending on design constraints their field of view is the user's naked eye field of view, and their non-focusing collimated nature means they don't have the optical telescopes constraint of eye relief. Reflector <b>sights</b> can be combined with telescopes, usually by placing the telescope directly behind the sight so it can view the projected reticle creating a telescopic sight, but this re-introduces the problems of narrow field of view and limited eye relief. The primary drawback of reflector sight is that they need some way to illuminate the reticle to function. Reticles illuminated by ambient light are hard to use in low light situations, and <b>sights</b> with electrical illumination stop functioning altogether if that system fails.|$|E

5|$|Compared to {{standard}} telescopic <b>sights,</b> a reflector sight {{can be held}} at any distance from the eye (does not require a designed eye relief), and at almost any angle, without distorting {{the image of the}} target or reticle. They are often used with both eyes open (the brain will tend to automatically superimpose the illuminated reticle image coming from the dominant eye onto the other eye's unobstructed view), giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view. Since Reflector <b>sights</b> are not dependent on eye relief, they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically-convenient mounting position on a weapon.|$|E

50|$|In 1910, {{after three}} years of trials, the Number 7 Dial <b>Sight</b> was adopted. This was a very heavily {{modified}} version (notably using external instead of internal scales) of the German Goertz panoramic <b>sight.</b> This, with its <b>sight</b> mount that again included a <b>sight</b> clinometer, replaced the No 3. However, resolving various issues, notably with the <b>sight</b> and mount carrying case mounted on the shield, meant that the Number 7 <b>sight</b> did not enter service until early in 1914.|$|R
50|$|The small diopter viewing opening {{ensures the}} shooter's eye is very {{precisely}} and consistently centered behind the diopter <b>sight.</b> The diopter <b>sight</b> {{is easy to}} use and usually allows for very accurate aiming, because a relative long <b>sighting</b> line can be used. A long <b>sighting</b> line helps to reduce eventual angle errors and will, in case the <b>sight</b> has an incremental adjustment mechanism, adjust in smaller increments when compared to a further identical shorter <b>sighting</b> line.|$|R
5|$|Most <b>sights</b> {{have either}} active or passive {{adjustments}} for the reticle brightness, which help the shooter adapt to different lighting conditions. A very dim reticle will help prevent loss of night vision in low-light conditions, while a brighter reticle will display more clearly in full sunlight.|$|E
5|$|The P90 was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Ring <b>Sights</b> HC-14-62 reflex sight, but the current weapon is instead fitted with the Ring <b>Sights</b> MC-10-80 sight, which was specifically designed for it. The HC-14-62 has a polymer housing and uses a forward-aimed fiber optic collector to illuminate the white daytime reticle, which consists of a large circle of about 180 minutes of arc (MOA), with a 20 MOA circle surrounding a 3.5 MOA dot in the center. The MC-10-80 has an anodized aluminium housing, and has a similar black reticle. The night reticle for both the HC-14-62 and the MC-10-80 consists of an open T that is primarily illuminated by a tritium module, and, in the HC-14-62, ambient light drawn in by an upward-facing collector. The sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation, {{and it can be}} used in conjunction with night vision equipment. As backup in case the reflex sight is damaged, a set of fixed iron <b>sights</b> is provided {{on each side of the}} reflex sight housing.|$|E
