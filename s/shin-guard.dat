500|$|Throughout {{the latter}} stages of his career, he wore special thigh- and shin-pads {{to protect himself}} from injury in the ruckâ€”his specially-designed shin-pad was {{required}} to protect a problematic shin injury which had threatened his career. During a match in 2003, he was kicked in the shin, causing his shin-pad to crack and split the skin, leaving a laceration {{about the size of}} a tablespoon. Once the wound had healed, White's surgeon told him that if it split open again, he would have to stop playing. White has said that this [...] "reality check" [...] helped to strengthen his focus and helped him deal with injuries more effectively. He said that the specially-designed <b>shin-guard</b> and those who designed it [...] "saved his career". (The <b>shin-guard</b> can be seen on White's right-leg in the photos on this page.) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 4 th October 2018. Composites {{reinforced}} with braided textiles exhibit high structural stability and excellent damage tolerance, making them ideal materials {{for use in}} sports-protection equipment. In sports impact scenarios, braided composites need to maintain their structure integrity and dissipate impact energy to protect a human body. Thus, {{it is crucial to}} study the dynamic response of a composite structure and its energy-dissipation mechanisms. Here, a multi-scale computational approach was explored to capture main damage modes of a braided textile composite; simulations were supported by experimental verification. A drop-weight test was performed with a spike-shape impactor to imitate real-life sports impact collision scenarios, followed by X-ray computed micro-tomography to characterize damage morphology of the specimen. The experimental results were compared with analytical models. The extent of delamination was quantified by applying surface- and element-based cohesive zone models. A ply-level model with three-dimensional continuum and shell elements was employed to explore the effect of through-thickness failure modes on energy absorption of the composite. The propagation mechanism of matrix cracks is also discussed. In addition, with the developed model, impact-attenuation performance of a <b>shin-guard</b> structure was simulated. The presented modelling capability can improve design of braided composite structures for sports and other protective and structural applications...|$|E
50|$|The only {{mandatory}} {{equipment for}} goalkeepers are masks, goalie-shirts, goalie-pants and shoes. Most goalkeepers also wear gloves. They may also optionally wear other protective equipment, such as knee pads, elbow-guards, <b>shin-guards,</b> jocks and torso armor. In some junior/independent leagues, many goalkeepers don't even wear goalie-shirts, but hooded tops.|$|R
60|$|So Miss Corner {{went off}} to get two sticks and a ball {{and came back to}} {{instruct}} Mr. Direck. She said he had a good eye. The two small boys scenting play in the air got sticks and joined them. The overnight visitor's wife appeared from the house in abbreviated skirts, and wearing formidable <b>shin-guards.</b> With her abundant fair hair, which was already breaking loose, so to speak, to join the fray, she looked like a short stout dismounted Valkyr. Her gaze was clear and firm.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFoamed rubbers {{are widely}} used for the shoe-soles, <b>shin-guards,</b> protectors and so on. The complex {{microstructure}} of foamed rubber consists of rubber matrix and pores. Therefore, foamed rubbers show good shock-absorbing properties in addition to good formability and lightweight. The mechanical characteristics of foamed rubber {{are determined by the}} mechanical characteristics of rubber matrix and its microstructure. In this study, a homogenization numerical analysis of mechanical characteristics of foamed rubber considering the rubber matrix and microstructure was shown. In order to develop the evaluation method, the microstructure of the foamed rubber was assumed to have the periodical holes, and a homogenization FEM code for formed rubber was developed based on homogenization theory with hyperelasticity. To verify the applicability of our developed code, rectangular rubber specimens with periodically holes were prepared to observe stress distributions of periodical inner structure. Incompressible hyperelasticity was applied to the rubber matrix. The material parameters of hyperelasticity for rubber matrix were identified by the biaxial tensile test results. Compression test of the rubber specimen reproducing FEM model was conducted to verify the applicability of the analysis code. The analysis result showed good agreement with the compression test result in the low strain region...|$|R
