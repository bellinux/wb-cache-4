40|$|International audienceThe Roussillon Basin is a non-silled Miocene {{sedimentary}} basin filling a late Oligocene–early Miocene graben. The basin was intensively {{impacted by the}} 2 Messinian fluvial erosion, as evidenced in exposed sections, in seismic profiles and in deep boreholes drilled for hydrocarbon exploration. As the basin was open to the Mediterranean Sea, the huge drop in sea level {{at the peak of}} the Messinian Salinity Crisis is clearly recorded, along with the subsequent sudden marine reflooding and the resulting prograding <b>sedimentary</b> <b>filling,</b> particularly in Gilbert-type fan deltas. Here, the Messinian Erosional Surface (MES) is accurately mapped in a high-resolution document, which corrects the confusion resulting from the set of 1 : 50, 000 scale regional maps. Aim of the 3 D reconstruction of the MES is to modernize geological mapping, a crucial challenge for Mediterranean and peripheral areas. Thanks to a reliable chronostratigraphy provided by planktonic foraminifers, calcareous nannofossils, micro-and macro-mammal remains, paleomagnetism and a 10 Be cosmogenic nuclide-derived study, our reconstruction is one of the most comprehensive models of changes in sea level from 6 to 3 Ma. After the marine reflooding of the Mediterranean Basin at 5. 46 Ma, the fluctuations in sea level recorded in the Roussillon Basin were forced by global changes. Following reflooding, the Prades large olistostrome collapsed prepared by the previous exhumation along the Canigou fault. The olistostrome is a good example of a local accident resulting from Messinian events.

40|$|A large gas {{reservoir}} in the Sinian Dengying Fm was recently discovered in Anyue area, central Sichuan Basin. In {{order to promote}} {{the oil and gas}} exploration in this area, it is of great significance to sustainably deepen the analysis on its high-quality reservoir distribution and source-reservoir assemblage. In this paper, a series of studies were performed on the sequence frameworks and <b>sedimentary</b> <b>filling</b> evolution characteristics of the Dengying Fm in central–western Sichuan Basin, and their controlling effects on the reservoir development and distribution and source-reservoir assemblage during its sedimentation. It is shown that the Deyang–Anyue paleo-rift is, on the whole, distributed in a NW direction, and is morphologically wide and steep in the north, but narrow and gentle in the south. There are two rift boundaries of the second and fourth members of Dengying Fm (Deng 2 Member and Deng 4 Member, respectively). The rift of Deng 2 Member is distributed in the shape of “U” in Deyang–Neijiang area. Dengying Fm is divided into four third-order sequences (SQ 1 –SQ 4). In SQ 3 of Gaoshiti–Moxi area, central Sichuan Basin, a complete sedimentation reflection structure of transgressive overlap and regressive progradation can be identified with early–middle Deng 4 Member platform margin. The paleo-rift was in embryo before the sedimentation of Sinian, so the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>filling</b> and lithofacies distribution of the Sinian were influenced by the inherited activities of pre-Sinian rifts. The favorable distribution zones of high-quality reservoirs are located at the rift margins of Deng 2 and Deng 4 Members that were formed respectively during the SQ 2 and SQ 4 and the platform margin of early Deng 4 Member that was formed during the SQ 3. A laterally connected source-reservoir assemblage occurs at the margins of Deng 2 and Deng 4 Members around the Lower Cambrian source rocks of the paleo-rift. The northwestward extending margin zone along the eastern flank of the paleo-rift shows a good potential for hydrocarbon accumulation...|$|E

40|$|Hectometer wide cryptokarsts in Paleozoic {{limestone}} from Southern Belgium {{have been}} studied, to determine {{to what extent}} U, Th, Pb and rare earth elements (REE) have been mobilized in the karst <b>sedimentary</b> <b>filling,</b> during a Miocene weathering event. The weathering process resulted in the massive halloysite/kaolinite formation at the karst wall. As with most fossil systems, data on weathering fluid chemistry are lacking, hence {{it is difficult to}} quantify relevant parameters such as pH, Eh, and to address solution chemistry. However, on the basis of both field studies of more recent systems, and of geochemical modeling, it is proposed that moderately acid fluids percolated through a multi-layer <b>sedimentary</b> <b>filling,</b> in near-surface conditions and in a temperate/warm climate. Special attention is paid to the trace element immobilization/trapping processes, in newly crystallized REE phosphates, at the karst wall. Analytical methods used include major/trace element geochemistry (emission ICP, ICP-MS) and mineralogy (XRD, SEM, TEM, microprobe). The results suggest that both the sandy sediments that are in contact with the karst carbonate wall, and the carbonate wall itself acted as a kind of geochemical "barrier". Mineralization cells settled there, at the decimeter to meter scale. This results in sequential trace element (Pb, Th, REE, U) trapping, according to the affinity of these elements for the aqueous solution. At the end of the sequence, minute U-rich automorphic (Ce, Nd) monazite crystals (from 3 nm upwards) formed on kaolinite flakes. Though the analogy between the studied cryptokarst and planned surface-based repositories for low-level radioactive waste (LLW) in argillaceous context is far from complete, the results outlined here are relevant because they show that even in natural - i. e. intrinsically uncontrolled and unmonitored - systems, "pollutant" radionuclide (U, Th, REE, Pb) migration paths are often limited in space. Various processes converge towards trapping of these elements, that are present in the radioactive waste. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

30|$|Those {{unconventional}} {{oil shale}} resources containing more than 50 % of their initial hydrocarbon generation potential {{will be able}} to produce significant quantities of hydrocarbons by hydraulic fracturing. As long as they are hosted in thick marl series preventing tertiary hydrocarbon migration to reservoir rocks, desorption of hydrocarbons may be achieved by the existence of natural fracturing and microfracturing as well as a juxtaposed rich organic bed alternated with the poor organic ones. In this context, dark shales may provide hydrocarbons by thermal cracking that would migrate into clear limestone facies constituting thin reservoirs into black shale source rocks. Taking account of all those characteristics, the Aptian–Albian petroleum source rock system can be qualified, according to the unconventional source rock classification established by Jarvie (2012), as an “unconventional oil shale hybrid systems with a combination of juxtaposed organic-rich and organic-lean intervals associated to open fractures”.
