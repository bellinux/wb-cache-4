40|$|Abstract—Providing network {{security}} {{is one of}} the most important tasks in todays Internet. Unfortunately, many users are not able to protect themselves and their networks. There-fore, a novel security concept is presented to protect users by providing security measures at the Internet Service Provider level. Already now, Internet Service Providers are using differ-ent security measures, e. g., Virtual Local Area Network tags, MAC limitation, or MAC address translation. The presented approach extends these security measures by three hardware-based <b>security</b> <b>subsystems.</b> A firewall engine controls the header of Ethernet frames, Internet packets, and the next following protocols. Furthermore, a Web filter module disables access to violent and child pornography Web content. The third subsystem is a Bloom filter-based deep packet inspection engine to observe the payload after the protocol header. Based on dee...|$|R

50|$|Local <b>Security</b> Authority <b>Subsystem</b> Service (LSASS) is {{a process}} in Microsoft Windows {{operating}} systems {{that is responsible for}} enforcing the security policy on the system.

50|$|Mandatory Integrity Control {{is defined}} {{using a new}} access control entry (ACE) type to {{represent}} the object's IL in its security descriptor. In Windows, Access Control Lists (ACLs) are used to grant access rights (read, write, and execute permissions) and privileges to users or groups. An IL is assigned to a subject's access token when initialized. When the subject tries to access an object (for example, a file), the Security Reference Monitor compares the integrity level in the subject's access token against the integrity level in the object's security descriptor. Windows restricts the allowed access rights {{depending on whether the}} subject's IL is higher or lower than the object, and depending on the integrity policy flags in the new access control entry (ACE). The <b>security</b> <b>subsystem</b> implements the integrity level as a mandatory label to distinguish it from the discretionary access under user control that ACLs provide.|$|E
50|$|Positioned {{above the}} {{operating}} system core are the subsystems. There {{are two types of}} subsystems: one are the integral subsystems, which perform important operating system functions. One such subsystem is the <b>security</b> <b>subsystem,</b> which handles the logon process and monitors the security of the system. The other type of subsystem is the environment subsystem, which exposes {{the operating system}} functions to applications via application programming interfaces. The base subsystem is the 32-bit subsystem which runs 32-bit applications written for Windows NT. Windows NT applications can only run on one platform, and must be recompiled for every platform. The 32-bit subsystem also contains all output functions, including the Graphics Device Interface (GDI), so all other subsystems have to call the 32-bit subsystem to be able to output text or graphics. Other subsystems contained in Windows NT 3.1 are the POSIX subsystem, which supports POSIX-compatible applications built for Windows NT, and, in the x86 version only, the OS/2 subsystem, which allows command-line based OS/2 1.x applications to run.|$|E

30|$|Most {{of current}} server chips include a {{subsystem}} dedicated for system management. The subsystem {{is basically a}} tiny computer-within-a-computer normally embedded directly in the chip along with the host processor cores. Typical examples of such subsystems include Intel Management Engine (ME) (Datenschutz and Pataky 2017; Bogowitz and Swinford 2004), AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP) (Advanced Micro Devices 2018 b; Wikimedia Foundation 2018) and Power On Chip Controller (OCC) (Sinharoy et al. 2015). The functions of these subsystems include managing the boot process, keeping the system under thermal limits, and running based on user input modes and parameters. The subsystems {{can also be used}} to monitor the system for identifying suspicious activities or events, and make appropriate responses. As <b>security</b> <b>subsystems</b> usually contain a rich set of hardware-based cryptographic primitives, they process security related functions, such as secure boot, secure updates, secure debug and secure communication, significantly faster than software-only solutions.|$|R
30|$|The most {{comprehensive}} survey about current literature addressing cloud security issues {{is given by}} Vaquero et al. in [3]. It categorizes the most widely accepted cloud security issues into three different domains of the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model: machine virtualization, network virtualization and physical domain. It also proposes prevention frameworks on several architectural levels to address the identified issues. While Chen et al. state in [4] that many IaaS-related cloud security problems are problems of traditional computing solved by presented technology frameworks it also demands an architecture that enables “mutual trust” for cloud user and cloud provider. Both papers confirm and complete the cloud specific security issues identified by our research. Furthermore, they identified a demand of a two-way trust enabling architecture for cloud infrastructures {{and the ability of}} “selectable security primitives with well considered defaults” [4]. The SAaaS architecture will provide this mutual trust.
