50|$|BreakQuest {{features}} over 50 power-ups, {{referred to}} as Capsules by their pill-formed shape. These are casually released by the elimination of obstacles, but can also be granted at certain times, or simply spawn {{at the beginning of}} specific levels. Capsules can assist the player by providing weapons that help clear the levels faster, but may also increase the difficulty by changing the shape and behaviour of the ball and the bumper. Aside from the <b>safety</b> <b>block</b> and bonus ship Capsules, the player can also acquire reserve balls by collecting enough stars from star Capsules. If the only ball in play is lost, the reserve ball will launch automatically. However, the player is also given the choice to launch any number of reserve balls in-game at any time, with the penalty that a Ship will be lost if there are no balls or reserve balls left in play.|$|E
5000|$|For the 700-MHz auction, the FCC {{designed}} a new multi-round process that limits {{the number of}} package bids that each bidder can submit (12 items and 12 package bids) and the prices at which they can be submitted, provides computationally intensive feedback prices similar to the pricing approach. [...] This package bidding process (which {{is often referred to}} as combinatorial auctions) was the first of its kind to be used by the FCC in an actual auction. Bidders were allowed to bid on individual licenses or on an all-or-nothing bid which could be done up to twelve packages, which the bidder determined at any point in the auction. Doing the auction this way allowed the bidder to avoid the exposure problem when licenses are complements. The provisional winning bids are the set of consistent bids that maximize total revenues. The 700 MHz auction represented a good test-case for package bidding for two reasons. First, the 700 MHz auction only involves 12 licenses: 2 bands (one 10 MHz and one 20 MHz) in each of the 6 regions. [...] Secondly, prospective bidders had expressed interest in alternative packaging because some Internet service providers had different needs and the flexibility would benefit them. The FCC issued Public Notice DA00-1486 adopted and described the package bidding rules for the 700 MHz auction. The FCC’s original proposal allowed only nine package bids: the six 30 MHz regional bids and three nationwide bids (10, 20, or 30 MHz). Although these nine packages were consistent with the expressed desires or many prospective bidders, others felt that the nine packages were too restrictive. The activity rule is unchanged, aside from a new definition of activity and a lower activity requirement of 50%. A bidder must be active on 50% of its current eligibility or its eligibility in the next round will be reduced to two times its activity. Bids made in different rounds were treated as mutually exclusive and a bidder wishing to add a license or package to its provisional winnings must renew the provisional winning bids in the current round. [...] The FCC placed rules on public safety for the auction. 20 MHz of the valuable 700 MHz spectrum were set aside for the creation of a public/private partnership that will eventually roll out to a new nationwide broadband network tailored to the requirements of public safety. The FCC offered the commercial licensee extra spectrum adjacent to the public <b>safety</b> <b>block</b> that the licensee can use as it wants. The licensee is allowed to use whatever bandwidth that is available on the public safety side of the network to offer data services of their own.|$|E

40|$|Natural gas {{transmission}} is strongly connected with fire and explosion safety. Generally, explosion hazard occurs, when at least 5 % {{of natural gas}} {{is present in the}} atmospheric air. As high-pressure gas transmission infrastructure includes many potential sources of gas releases, both operational and accidental, many different cases should be considered. To properly face the potential hazard of explosive atmosphere formation, the hazardous zone should be estimated. There are some guidelines, describing the process of hazardous zones calculating. This paper compares calculations of such hazardous based on Polish and European standards which are also valid in Poland. Calculations are focused on releases that may occur on the <b>safety</b> <b>block</b> and relief valve systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} the problem of de-termination of error {{probability}} of cryptography and safety codes used within the safety-related railway ap-plications with increasing safety integrity level (SIL). In the paper are also described requirements for crypto-graphic block code and safety linear block code in safety-related communications for railway application. The main part is oriented to the description of mathemati-cal apparatus for the error probability of the cryptogra-phy and <b>safety</b> <b>block</b> codes for communication between two safety-related devices across GSM-R communica-tion channel. The practical results are related to the quantitative evaluation of an average error probability of the cryptography and safety codes for several lengths of safety-related messages which are expanded about de-termination of the cryptography degradation with using GMSK modulation scheme...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a Glucose-Insulin {{regulator}} for Type 1 Diabetes using artificial neural networks (ANN) is proposed. This is done using a discrete recurrent high order neural network {{in order to}} identify and control a nonlinear dynamical system which represents the pancreas? beta-cells behavior of a virtual patient. The ANN which reproduces and identifies the dynamical behavior system, is configured as series parallel and trained on line using the extended Kalman filter algorithm to achieve a quickly convergence identification in silico. The control objective is to regulate the glucose-insulin level under different glucose inputs and is based on a nonlinear neural block control law. A <b>safety</b> <b>block</b> is included between the control output signal and the virtual patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Simulations include a period of three days. Simulation results are compared during the overnight fasting period in Open-Loop (OL) versus Closed- Loop (CL). Tests in Semi-Closed-Loop (SCL) are made feedforward in order to give information to the control algorithm. We conclude the controller is able to drive the glucose to target in overnight periods and the feedforward is necessary to control the postprandial period...|$|E
