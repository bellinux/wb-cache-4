40|$|While it is {{well known}} that the U. S. Constitution prohibits the {{government}} from taking private property for public use without fair compensation, few realize that potential claimants have six years from the date the taking accrues to file a claim for damages. A six-year time limit, even strictly applied, may seem sufficiently lenient on its face. However, in 1994 the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently ruled, in interpreting this time limit, that plaintiffs who suffered severe erosion damage from a government channeling and port project constructed in the early 1950 s were not barred from filing suit in 1992 -over forty years after the erosion began. In Applegate v. United States, the court concluded that the date the governmental act became a permanent taking, or when the taking 2 ̆ 2 accrued, 2 ̆ 2 was not the date the government 2 ̆ 2 invaded 2 ̆ 2 the plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 property, or the date the plaintiffs first noticed property damage. Instead, the court used the date on which the government last pledged to repair the damage to determine whether the plaintiffs met the six-year statute of limitations. Because the government initiated plans to restore the damage as late as 1988, the court found that the statute of limitations had not run in 1992, the year the plaintiffs filed their claim. The Applegate decision, therefore, permits courts to use one governmental act to determine whether the procedural time limit is met, and another to determine the <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> <b>issue</b> of whether a taking occurred. In light of the fact that courts must first consider the procedural time limit issue before reaching the merits of a particular claim, the Applegate decision will provide more opportunities to sue the government for a taking. Although it may appear that the Applegate court stretched the six-year statute of limitations beyond its limits, this Note will demonstrate that the court 2 ̆ 7 s decision conforms with takings case law and upholds the principles of fairness that underlie statutes of limitations. This Note will also demonstrate that if the court had ruled that the statute of limitations barred the plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 claim, it would effectively relieve the federal government of its responsibility to repair government-caused damage or to compensate owners for taking their property, not only for the Applegate plaintiffs, but also for most other takings victims as well. Part II of this Note describes the procedure a property owner must follow to sue the government for taking her property, and the additional burdens coastal property owners face when they claim a government act caused flooding or erosion damage. Part III summarizes the Applegate decision. Part IV discusses the conflict between procedural time limits and the long periods that may elapse from the time of the governmental act to the time the act damages the property. Part V also describes methods courts have developed to ensure that time limits do not unjustly prevent a plaintiff from pursuing her claim in court. Part VI concludes that by requiring the government to consider the long-term impact of its acts on private property, the Applegate decision will help to preserve notions of individual justice and responsibility on the part of the government...|$|E

These results suggest a need to reconsider empirical and theoretical research that hinges on the existence of a single pivotal median justice...|$|R

It will argue that trade and climate change is a particularly difficult form of linkage for the international trade regime to deal with. But the paper will contend that much of the existing trade and climate change literature appears to have reacted to earlier ‘trade and’ debates in that increased mutual understanding of respective values and legal systems means that the focus is less on denunciation/defence of the World Trade Organisation, and more on the extent to which trade norms can accommodate key environmental/developmental concerns and values. The paper will go on to argue that international trade law has developed significant procedural mechanisms which might assist in problem solving on these issues. But there are significant gaps in its ability to solve <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> <b>issues.</b> It will further be argued that norms and standards from other areas of international law (e. g. common but differentiated responsibility) do little to assist in this endeavour.

40|$|English law has {{demonstrated}} {{itself to be}} particularly hostile {{to the idea of}} holding parents tortiously liable for the acts of their children. It deals with allegations of parental negligence with a degree of leniency that, arguably, defies all rational justification. In advocating reform, the primary objective of this thesis is to put forward a proposal for a new regime of liability that obliges parents to take much greater legal responsibility for their children's conduct. The proposition set out is that English law has a lot to learn from the continental approach to parental liability. In seeking guidelines for change, the French system is singled out as a particularly good model for comparison. Over the years it has experimented with different forms of parental liability, and so its law in this respect is well developed, not to mention excellently documented. The French system offers two main options for reform: a regime of strict liability based on a rebuttable presumption of fault or a regime of vicarious liability. It is contended that, for present purposes, the former offers the more viable solution for a legal system that is notoriously resistant to the concept of no-fault liability. In adapting this French regime to suit English needs, the focus of this thesis is on the <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> <b>issues</b> involved. The normative feasibility of the proposed regime is established by demonstrating its consistency with the principles of English negligence law. This, in turn, is done by demonstrating the existence, in a typical parental liability action, of the elements of duty of care, breach of duty and both factual and legal causation...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{presents the}} main features and evolutions of the legal protection of religions’ food prescriptions in different legal systems, with a special reference to Italian law. The most important religious prescriptions are analyzed by classifying them in relation to food consumption, production, and distribution, and by looking at them {{in the light of}} constitutional precepts governing Italian church law. The article focuses on the legal norms that in the last few decades have dealt with several topics in the field, ranging from the right to have food preferences respected for prisoners and institutionalized people, food choices for children in schools, to the regulation of animal slaughtering. Several formal and <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> <b>issues</b> emerge that reveal the complexity of the debate and that call for protection of religious freedom to be constitutionally broadened and strengthened through the recognition of religious diversities. From a substantive point of view, a slow but growing legislative interest in food rules and their protection may be outlined. From a formal point of view, the variety of legal instruments that have been used in this field, primarily influenced by European directives, especially in the regulation of slaughtering, are not yet fully integrated in Italian church law. In Italy, the path towards religious food-related needs being recognized and implemented is deemed to be long and uneven. A law encompassing all aspects of religious freedom, and connecting substantive and formal requirements, is still lacking. Such provision would represent a major improvement, as it could provide a valid regulatory framework for all religions’ food prescriptions that are increasingly perceived as a fundamental aspect of the faithful’s human dignity...|$|R

40|$|This Comment {{demonstrates}} that policy judgements are not masked by philosophical references, nor do philosophers play any {{crucial role in}} contentious judicial decisions. Neomi Rao's study is flawed for many reasons: incomplete content analysis, poor assessment of data, and an inadequate definition of philosophy. She should be criticised for hypocritically praising Court philosopher references in some instances and not others, {{especially with regard to}} the Court's early development. This Comment searched unsuccessfully for an instance where philosophers were cited just once in controversial cases regarding racial integration, capital punishment's abolition and re-legality, and the 2000 Presidential election. Philosophers are peculiarly absent from major controversial cases. Rao claims the Court's majority decisions avoided the "Philosophers' Brief" because the philosophers' argument was grounded in theory, not <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> argument surrounding <b>issues</b> of judicial precedent. This Comment challenges Rao's use of "philosophy" as something entirely abstract and steeped in metaphysics. Philosophy is presented as a large umbrella covering diverse sub-fields, two of which are philosophy of law and political philosophy. These sub-fields are of great use to law. Thus, the Court has not illegitimately used philosophers to support personal policy preferences. Nor is the use of philosophy incommensurable with judicial decision-making...|$|R
40|$|In this Essay, we {{consider}} the contribution of a startling new book, Law 2 ̆ 6 Neuroscience (L 2 ̆ 6 N), by Owen Jones, Jeffrey Schall, and Francis Shen. It is a law school course book (a genre not often {{the focus of a}} scholarly review essay) that supports fundamental inquiry into the relationship between emerging neuroscientific insights and doctrinal conceptions in the law. We believe that the book shifts the paradigm and so may profoundly affect the course of normative evaluation of law. In this Essay, we trace and evaluate the “argument” of the book and suggest ways in which its contribution to the normative analysis of law may impact students and legal scholars for years to come. We believe that L 2 ̆ 6 N is that rare work that will, quite literally, change the way people think. The book’s power rests, securely, on two premises: (1) legal doctrine derives mainly from our folk psychological intuitions (based on our inferences about others’ beliefs, desires, and intentions) concerning human agency and, in particular, our capacities for practical reason; and (2) progress in the sciences of the mind, including neuroscience, casts grave doubts on folk intuitions at the core of our understanding of human agency. It is folk psychology that gives way to an understanding informed by neuroscience, compelling revision of our notions of responsibility embodied in contracts, torts, and criminal law. Part I describes the dynamic balance and pedagogical power that the format of L 2 ̆ 6 N achieves. That dynamic and power is illustrated in the contrast between the neurological reductionism endorsed by Francis Crick and skepticism expressed by Stephen Morse concerning the relevance of neuroscience to legal doctrine. On Crick’s view, if our folk psychological intuitions come into conflict with known neurological facts, it is folk intuitions that must go. On Morse’s view, by contrast, there are, either in principle or merely in fact, no discoveries in neuroscience that threaten our folk view of ourselves. In their judicious selection of theoretical perspectives and case studies, the editors of L 2 ̆ 6 N sustain the Crick-Morse dichotomy across a wide range of <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> <b>issues.</b> We complete our analysis in Part II by taking a stand of our own—we show the very real challenges to law presented by the Crick-Morse dichotomy. With Crick and others, we argue that the former authority of our folk intuitions must be ceded to conflicting findings in science. In defense, we show that recent discoveries from cognitive neuroscience integrate with discoveries in affective neuroscience, and, from those premises, we defend two claims: (1) many human actions—those we intuitively judge to be evaluable in moral and legal terms—are, as a matter of fact, causally influenced by affective processes about which we cannot reason, precisely because those processes do not rise to conscious awareness; and (2) some information about our affective processes can rise to conscious awareness, but, even when that occurs, the actual causes of our actions are liable to misinterpretation. We conclude that, if either (1) or (2) is correct, assumptions at the core of our folk view of human agency cannot be sustained. The shift in paradigm is profound indeed...|$|R

A host of <b>substantive</b> and procedural <b>legal</b> <b>issues</b> prevent victims from seeking redress in national and international courts.
