5|$|Although the {{black-throated blue warbler}} is a {{socially}} monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. Nestling parentage is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and {{that the majority of}} the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier, which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony but there is no <b>significant</b> <b>association</b> with population level synchrony.|$|E
5|$|In humans, plasma {{triglycerides}} such as triacylglycerols {{have been}} long debated {{as an important}} risk factor for not only cardiovascular disease but also for other relevant morbidities, such as cancer, renal disease, suicide, and all-cause mortality. The APOA5 gene was found by comparative sequencing of ~200 kbp of human and mice DNA as the last member of the gene cluster of apolipoproteins located on human chromosome 11 at 11q23. Two mouse transgenic mouse models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 knockout) confirmed {{the important role of}} this gene in plasma triglyceride levels of plasma triglycerides. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are both closely related to plasma triglyceride levels and APOA5. Recent meta-analyses suggest that the effect on metabolic syndrome development is more profound for rs662799 in Asian population and for rs3135506 for Europeans. Moreover, meta-analysis that focused on rs662799 and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus has suggested a <b>significant</b> <b>association</b> in Asian populations, but not in European populations.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the cross-sectional associations between blood pressure, hypertension and dietary factors among 580 Mexican-American adults residing in Starr County, Texas. The data were collected as part of Gallbladder Disease Study between April, 1985 and December, 1986. ^ Dietary intake was assessed for the month previous to the interview {{by means of a}} 38 food item quantified frequency questionnaire representing foods and mixed dishes commonly consumed in the community. From the dietary information intake of calcium, cholesterol, total kilocalories, and percent of kilocalories contributed by total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, protein, carbohydrates were calculated. The effect of other factors associated with blood pressure, such as age, body mass index, body fat distribution, smoking, and drinking were controlled. ^ Age was the most important predictor of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and hypertension. For both males and females, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were consistently positively associated with body mass index but were not associated with waist hip ratio. However, a strong positive relationship between hypertension and waist hip ratio but not body mass index was observed. ^ After controlling for age and body mass index it was noted that for males there were no <b>significant</b> <b>associations</b> between the dietary variables and systolic blood pressure. For diastolic blood pressure there were <b>significant</b> <b>associations</b> with percent fat, percent monounsaturated fatty acids, percent protein and percent carbohydrates. ^ For females, there were <b>significant</b> <b>associations</b> between systolic blood pressure and percent protein, percent carbohydrates and cholesterol. There were no <b>significant</b> <b>associations</b> between dietary variables and diastolic blood pressure. ^ After controlling for age and waist hip ratio <b>significant</b> <b>associations</b> between hypertension and percent fat, percent saturated fat, percent monounsaturated fatty acids, percent carbohydrate and percent protein were observed in males. <b>Significant</b> <b>associations</b> between hypertension and percent polyunsaturated fatty acids and percent protein were noted in females. ...|$|R
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{body of research}} demonstrating a <b>significant</b> <b>association</b> between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains. Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, {{but it is a}} liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood. Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment. Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function. As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.|$|E

40|$|Neighborhood design affects {{lifestyle}} physical activity, {{and ultimately}} human wellbeing. There are, however, {{a limited number}} of studies that examine neighborhood design types. In this research, we examine four types of neighborhood designs: traditional development, suburban development, enclosed community, and cluster housing development, and assess their level of walkability and their effects on physical activity and wellbeing. We examine <b>significant</b> <b>associations</b> through a questionnaire (n = 486) distributed in Tucson, Arizona using the Walkability Model. Among the tested neighborhood design types, traditional development showed <b>significant</b> <b>associations</b> and the highest value for walkability, as well as for each of the two types of walking (recreation and transportation) representing physical activity. Suburban development showed <b>significant</b> <b>associations</b> and the highest mean values for mental health and wellbeing.

Enclosed community did not obtain the highest means for any wellbeing benefit. The Walkability Model proved useful in identifying the walkability categories associated with physical activity and perceived crime. For example, the experience category was strongly and inversely associated with perceived crime. This study provides empirical evidence of the importance of including vegetation, particularly trees, throughout neighborhoods in order to increase physical activity and wellbeing. Likewise, the results suggest that regular maintenance is an important strategy to improve mental health and overall wellbeing in cities...|$|R
