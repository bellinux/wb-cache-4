5|$|Mason's {{successor}} Horner {{proved to}} be extremely unpopular as governor and his tenure was very short. Residents disliked him <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> burned him in effigy and pelted him with vegetables upon his entry into the territorial capital. In the October 1835 elections, voters approved the draft constitution and elected the popular Mason as state governor. The same election saw Isaac E. Crary chosen as Michigan's first U.S. Representative to Congress. Because of the dispute Congress refused to accept his credentials and seated him as a non-voting delegate. The two U.S. Senators chosen by the state legislature in November, Lucius Lyon and John Norvell, were treated with even less respect, being allowed to sit only as spectators in the Senate gallery.|$|E
5|$|The feud between John Cena and Umaga {{continued}} on Raw the next night, where Umaga assaulted Cena after his match with The Great Khali and also interfered in Cena's match with Jonathan Coachman two weeks later. Due to the Umaga assault, Cena injured his spleen, which was portrayed as real in their storyline. At Royal Rumble, a Last Man Standing match, a match {{where the only}} way to win is to beat up your opponent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> can not get to their feet before the referee counts to ten was scheduled for the WWE Championship between Cena and Umaga.

The robot resembled {{a comic book}} character, so to avoid legal troubles, Level 9 commissioned Godfrey Dowson to do a new cover. Dowson's illustration {{depicted a}}nother robot in the jungle looking towards Enoch. Level 9 was {{not satisfied with the}} result and asked Dowson to do it again. They liked the third cover <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> <b>they</b> hired Dowson to do artwork for the re-release of their old games as well as for their future titles.|$|E
25|$|Diaghilev and {{composer}} Igor Stravinsky merged their talents to bring Russian folklore {{to life in}} The Firebird and Petrushka choreographed by Fokine. Diaghilev's next choreographic commissions went to Nijinsky. His First ballet was L'apres-midi d'un Faune (Afternoon of a Faun) to music by Debussy. It was notable for its two dimensional shapes and lack of ballet technique. It caused controversy by depicting the faun rubbing the scarf {{of one of the}} maidens on himself, in simulated masturbation. The most controversial work of the Ballets Russes however, was The Rite of Spring, choreographed by Nijinsky with music by Stravinsky. The ballet's modern music, pigeon toed stomping and theme of human sacrifice shocked audiences <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> rioted.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the massive}} success of the first film, it was {{generally}} expected that a sequel would follow. The film was produced on a budget of $25 million (USD), higher than {{the budget of the}} 1990 film, which was $13.5 million. Like the first film, New Line Cinema distributed The Secret of the Ooze. Both the voice actors of Michaelangelo and Leonardo reprised their roles in the second film, while Corey Feldman did not voice Donatello and Josh Pais did not voice Raphael in the second movie. Also, a different actress was cast for the role of April O'Neil, with Paige Turco replacing Judith Hoag from the first film. The character of Casey Jones, who was prominent in the first movie, did not appear here (though he did return in the following movie). Ernie Reyes Jr., who was Donatello's fight double in the first film, was cast as a new character, Keno, as the producers admired Reyes and his performance in the first movie <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> asked him to join the sequel. Todd W. Langen returned from the first film to write the screenplay.|$|E

500|$|Series co-creators, Dan Povenmire and Swampy Marsh, {{wrote the}} story for [...] "Flop Starz;" [...] Sherm Cohen and Antoine Guilbaud, meanwhile, {{constructed}} the storyboards. Povenmire directed the episode, which he did {{for the majority of}} the season. Povenmire and Marsh wrote the featured song, [...] "Gitchee Gitchee Goo," [...] like they do with all of the music in the show. That song and Perry's [...] "secret agent theme" [...] were the first pitched to Disney, who enjoyed it <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> wanted the pair to write a song for every episode.|$|E
500|$|When a {{civil war}} seemed unavoidable, Ellsworth {{proceeded}} to New York City to recruit his own regiment from the city's volunteer fire companies, stating: [...] "I want the New York Firemen, for {{there are no more}} effective men in the country, and none with whom I can do <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> <b>They</b> are sleeping on a volcano at Washington and I want men who can go into a fight now." [...] Two days after his arrival, Ellsworth awarded officer commissions to several foremen of the volunteer fire companies and began recruiting in earnest.|$|E
500|$|Creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar were {{initially}} {{trying to find}} someone {{for the role of}} Clark Kent, but Kristin Kreuk was the first to be cast, as Lana Lang. Casting director Coreen Mayrs sent David Nutter, the director of the pilot episode, a tape of 69 people and the second person on the tape was Kreuk. They loved her audition tape <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> immediately showed her to the network. For one of her auditions, she read the graveyard scene with Tom Welling; the network thought they had [...] "great chemistry". Jade Unterman and Louise Grant portrayed the character as a child and an elderly woman, respectively.|$|E

500|$|Lennon Parham, {{an actress}} and comedian {{who worked with}} Amy Poehler on the Upright Citizens Brigade sketch comedy troupe, made a guest {{appearance}} in [...] "Canvassing" [...] as Kate Speevak. Michael Schur said {{early on in the}} brainstorming process, the Parks and Recreation producers decided to establish an antagonist for Leslie named Kate Speevak, simply because they thought the name was funny. Seth Gordon said Poehler and Parham worked especially well together during their largely improvised scenes, which he attributed to their past work together on the Upright Citizens Brigade. [...] The resident who appeared to be a sex offender during the canvassing was played by Brian Huskey, who Schur called a [...] "fantastic improviser". Eric Edelstein portrayed Lawrence, a resident who antagonizes Leslie and Andy during the public meeting. Edelstein was not originally the actor assigned the [...] "Hey parks lady, you suck" [...] line, but the Parks and Recreation producers like Edelstein <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> gave it to him. Leslie's response line, [...] "Hear that? He called me park lady", was improvised by Poehler.|$|E
500|$|Observers, {{including}} series director David Petrarca and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, {{said that}} illegal downloads did not hurt the series' prospects; it benefited from [...] "buzz" [...] and social commentary, {{and the high}} piracy rate did not significantly translate to lost subscriptions. According to Polygon, HBO's relaxed attitude towards piracy and the sharing of login credentials amounted to a premium-television [...] "free-to-play" [...] model. At a 2015 Oxford Union debate, series co-creator David Benioff {{said that he was}} just glad that people watched the show; illegally downloaded copies of the show sometimes interested viewers enough to buy a copy of the show, especially in countries where the show was not televised. Co-creator D. B. Weiss had mixed feelings, saying that the show was expensive to produce and [...] "if it doesn't make the money back, then it ceases to exist". However, he was pleased that so many people [...] "enjoy the show <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> can't wait {{to get their hands on}} it." [...] In 2015, Guinness World Records called Game of Thrones the most-pirated television program.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} form, [...] "Behind The Lines", [...] "Duchess", [...] "Guide Vocal", [...] "Turn It On Again", [...] "Duke's Travels", and [...] "Duke's End" [...] were one 30-minute track that {{told a story}} of the fictional character [...] "Albert". The band decided against sequencing the tracks this way on the album, partly to avoid comparisons to their 23-minute track [...] "Supper's Ready" [...] from Foxtrot, but also to have certain segments of the suite, such as [...] "Duchess" [...] and [...] "Turn It On Again" [...] released as singles. A [...] "Duke Suite" [...] was performed live on the album's supporting tour with Collins introducing it as [...] "The Story of Albert." [...] "Turn It On Again" [...] was originally a short connecting piece {{in the middle of this}} medley, but the band enjoyed playing it <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> <b>they</b> decided to double its length and make it more of a standout track. The group considered placing the band written songs on side one and the individually written tracks on the other, but this was rejected. Rutherford described the final running order as [...] "a very balanced album".|$|E

500|$|The {{first episode}} {{featured}} {{the return of}} many characters. Actress Samantha Smith reprised her role as Mary Winchester in a flashback, with Chad Lindberg making an appearance as the hunter Ash. Actor Gabriel Tigerman of the second-season episode [...] "Simon Said" [...] guest starred as the mind-controlling Andy Gallagher, and Katharine Isabelle of [...] "Hunted" [...] returned as the missing Ava Wilson. Other of Azazel's psychic children introduced in the episode were the heart-stopping Lily, portrayed by Jessica Harmon, and the super-strong Jake Talley, who is played in both episodes by Aldis Hodge. Actor Jim Beaver also guest starred in both parts as recurring character Bobby Singer, as did Fredric Lehne as the yellow-eyed demon Azazel. Lehne first portrayed the character in the second-season premiere [...] "In My Time of Dying", and was originally meant to only play the part temporarily because the demon changes human hosts periodically. However, the show runners liked him <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> kept him in the role. Executive producer and director Kim Manners was happy with this decision, believing that Lehne brought to the character [...] "a real Jack Nicholson flavor". The second episode brought back actress Samantha Ferris as hunter Ellen Harvelle, as well as Jeffrey Dean Morgan as John Winchester, whose previous appearance was in the season premiere. Morgan's busy schedule required his scenes for the episode to be filmed weeks in advance.|$|E
500|$|Other {{characters}} {{returned from}} the first year. Actor Jim Beaver made multiple appearances as hunter Bobby Singer, an old family friend of the Winchesters. Beaver had expected his first-season guest appearance in [...] "Devil's Trap" [...] to be a [...] "one-shot deal", and was surprised {{when he was asked}} to return. Adrianne Palicki reprised her role as Sam's deceased girlfriend Jessica in the alternate-reality episode [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be", as did Samantha Smith as Mary Winchester. Smith also made an appearance in a flashback in the penultimate episode, [...] "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part One". And though at first reluctant because of his role on Grey's Anatomy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan returned as John Winchester in the season premiere and finale. However, the character dies in the premiere because the writers worried that having him separated from his sons againâ€”Sam and Dean spend much of the first season tracking him downâ€”would [...] "split the show" [...] by having him away [...] "doing more interesting things than the boys are doing". As a demon, the villain Azazel periodically switches hosts, and was first fully portrayed by Morgan in the first-season finale. The reins passed to Fredric Lehne for the second-season premiere, and the show's producers enjoyed his performance <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> brought him back for the two-part finale.|$|E
500|$|The character's main love {{interest}} throughout his duration on {{the soap opera}} was Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), whom he married in 2011. Nichols had previously stated {{in an interview that}} he thought Tucker would [...] "definitely 'team up' when he finds the right woman". Davidson stated in an interview that the pair will [...] "have their ups and downs, but they're definitely in each other's lives." [...] In September 2011, it is revealed that Tucker is the biological father of Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), the result of a long-ago affair with Harmony Hamilton (Debbi Morgan). When asked of Tucker's reaction to the news, Morgan stated: [...] "It's revealed that Devon was the result of a one-night stand between Harmony and Tucker. That night meant the world to herâ€”Tucker was the love of her lifeâ€”but it meant so little to him that he doesn't even recognize Harmony when they meet again. Not a clue! It's like a dagger through her heart." [...] James said he was [...] "overjoyed" [...] at the revelation, stating: [...] "There's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>they</b> can do with this story. The relationship between Tucker and Devonâ€”my character allowing that relationship to grow. How it affects Neil. And there's a plethora of possibilities that can come from his relationship with Mrs. Chancellor. I'm sure that relationship will develop just as it will with Devon and Tucker. And then, there's Devon's mother, Harmony, who is back." [...] Tucker and Ashley's marriage ended the following year, after he cheated on her with Harmony. Following their divorce, Nichols stated in an interview with Xfinity that Tucker would [...] "have to find a new woman" [...] as he [...] "can't be without female companionship".|$|E

2500|$|In February 2015, Eddie Murphy {{stated that}} his cameo {{appearance}} in the pilot ironically doomed the show's chances: [...] "I was gonna be in the pilot, and they thought I should be recurring. Iâ€™m not gonna do Beverly Hills Cop on TV. I remember when they tested it â€” they had this little knob that you turn {{if you like it}} or you donâ€™t like it. So when Axel shows up in the pilot, some people turned the knob <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> <b>they</b> broke it. So the network decided 'if he isnâ€™t recurring, then this isnâ€™t gonna happen.' So it didnâ€™t happen." ...|$|E
