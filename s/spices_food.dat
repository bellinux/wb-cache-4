Zingiber officinale Roscoe, {{family of}} Zingiberaceae is {{classified}} as traditional medicinal that globally consumed as <b>spices,</b> <b>food</b> flavouring as well as remedies to treat women during confinement, to treat stomach upset and diarrhoea. The rhizome {{has been reported to}} contain abundant bioactive constituents which are mainly polyphenol and flavonoid. Therefore in this research the effect of cabinet drying (60 ºC) and freeze drying (- 40 ºC) process during preparation of nanostructure Zingiber officinale Roscoe rhizome on particle sizes, surface morphology, FTIR, as well as Total Phenolic Content (TPC) and Total Flavonoid Content(TFC) were compared. Both drying process affect the particle sizes as well as TPC and TFC value. Finer particle size (254. 3 + 9. 33) and higher TPC (152. 54 mg GAE / g) and TFC (1. 42 mgQE/g) were reported for cabinet dried nanostructure Zingiber officinale Rosc. rhizome as compared to freeze dried. The FESEM Photographs revealed that drying processes did affect the surface morphologies of nanostructure Zingiber officinale Rosc rhizome where cabinet dried produced solid spherical particles with a diameter around 100 – 200 nm and some smaller than 100 nm.

40|$|Objectives: Capsaicin (CAP) is {{the chief}} pungent {{principle}} found in the hot red peppers and the chili peppers that have long been used as <b>spices,</b> <b>food</b> additives and drugs. This study investigated the anticancer potential of CAP through its ability to modify extracellular matrix components and proteases during mice lung carcinogenesis. Methods: Swiss albino mice were treated with benzo(a) pyrene (50 mg/kg body weight dissolved in olive oil) orally twice a week for four successive weeks to induce lung cancer {{at the end of}} 14 th week. CAP was administrated (10 mg/kg body weight dissolved in olive oil) intraperitoneally. Extracellular matrix components were assayed; Masson’s trichome staining of lung tissues was performed. Western blot analyses of matrix metalloproteases 2 and 9 were also carried out. Results: In comparison with the control animals, animals in which benzo(a) pyrene had induced lung cancer showed significant increases in extracellular matrix components such as collagen (hydroxy proline), elastin, uronic acid and hexosamine and in glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronate, chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. The above alterations in extracellular matrix components were effectively counteracted in benzo(a) pyrene along with CAP supplemented animals when compared to benzo(a) pyrene alone supplemented animals. The results of Masson’s trichome staining for collagen and of, immunoblotting analyses of matrix metalloproteases 2 and 9 further supported the biochemical findings. Conclusion: The apparent potential of CAP in modulating extracellular matrix components and proteases suggests that CAP plays a chemomodulatory and anti- cancer role working against experimentally induced lung carcinogenesis...|$|E

This study evaluated the modulator effect of a crude hydroalcoholic ExT on some peripheral human neutrophil functions. The neutrophil reactive oxygen species generation, triggered by opsonized zymosan (OZ), n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and assessed by luminol- and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (LumCL and LucCL, respectively), was inhibited by ExT in a concentration-dependent manner. ExT was a more effective inhibitor of the PMA-stimulated neutrophil function [IC(50) (in mu g/ 10 (6) cells) = 115. 7 +/- 9. 7 (LumCL) and 174. 5 +/- 25. 9 (LucCL) ], than the OZ- [IC(50) = 248. 5 +/- 23. 1 (LumCL) and 324. 1 +/- 34. 6 (LucCL) ] or fMLP-stimulated cells [IC(50) = 178. 5 +/- 12. 2 (LumCL) ]. The ExT also inhibited neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity (evaluated by O(2) consumption), degranulation and elastase activity (evaluated by spectrophotometric methods) at concentrations higher than 200 mu g/ 10 (6) cells, without being toxic to the cells, under the conditions assessed. Together, these results indicate the potential of ExT {{as a source of}} compounds that can modulate the neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the present work, twenty rats {{were divided into two}} groups: control and capsaicin groups, each consisting of ten rats. The capsaicin group daily received a capsaicin dose equivalent to 0. 1  mg/kg body weight dissolved in 0. 5  ml distilled water by oro-oesophageal tube while the control group daily received 0. 5  ml distilled water. After twenty one days, the submandibular salivary glands of both sides were excised, processed and examined histologically and ultrastructurally. Histological results revealed presence of pure mucous acini in the submandibular salivary gland. Some granular convoluted tubules showed degeneration while the excretory ducts showed loss of pseudostratification with the appearance of some flattened lining cells. Concerning the ultrastructural findings, some acinar cells showed dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum, other presented ultrastructural features similar to mucous acini. Granular convoluted tubules cells showed some irregular, shrunken nuclei with condensed chromatin. Their secretory granules were less electrondense than the control and presented ill-defined and fused outlines. Some of the excretory duct lining cells showed apically displaced irregular nuclei. One to two rows of flattened epithelial cells were observed apical to the lining cells. Vacuolizations, mitochondrial swelling and loss of cristae were detected in cells of some acini, granular convoluted tubules and excretory ducts. Most intercalated and striated duct cells showed ultrastructural features similar to that of control group. However, the basal part of some striated duct cells presented variable grades of mitochondrial affection. From the present work, it could be concluded that chronic capsaicin intake was associated with noticeable histological and ultrastructural changes in acini, granular convoluted tubules and excretory ducts of the SMSG in albino rats...|$|E

40|$|Food {{has long}} played an {{important}} part in shaping behaviour and identity, especially in a domestic setting. It was, for instance, central to hospitality and largesse in the pre-modern great house and to notions of magnificence or elegance of table. This links food closely to the kind of conspicuous consumption discussed by Veblen as characteristic of the leisured classes: the consumption of ‘more excellent goods’ being evidence of wealth and status. Defining the precise nature of these goods is problematic, but they included a range of groceries which Smith and others have identified as luxuries: most notably sugar and <b>spices.</b> <b>Food</b> was also associated with social distinction: taste could be communicated through fashionable food and novel drinks such as tea, coffee and chocolate. Berg argues that the pursuit of novelty is intrinsically pleasurable since it stimulates arousal by providing variety, complexity and surprise. Drinking tea and coffee afforded novel physical experiences, whilst the wide range of teas available by the mid eighteenth century provided variety and complexity. Yet novelty needed to be accommodated within existing norms and practices of consumption; it had to be ‘recognizable, and tastes developed to appreciate it’. In this paper I draw on these ideas to explore certain aspects of the consumption of groceries in the home. In particular, I focus on the way in which certain goods were viewed and consumed as novelties or luxuries. Here, I begin by considering how novelty might be defined for the individual consumer and how purchases of groceries might reflect a pursuit of the new. The trickle down of novelties such as tea and coffee is then examined alongside the strong continuities that emerge in patterns of consumption. Next, luxury is explored in terms of exclusivity and, in more nuanced terms, using Appadurai’s register, as luxuries. Despite the growing availability of tea, sugar and so on, some consumers were clearly concerned with the quality of the groceries being purchased, whether as novel items which could add new experiences or fashionability to their eating and drinking, or as luxuries which helped to distinguish them in some way from the common order...|$|E
40|$|Hugh Saul, {{a native}} of Guyana, {{qualified}} as a manager. In recent years he has managed agricultural research and development projects in the Caribbean for several international and regional organizations. He is currently the Deputy Executive Director (Development) of the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI). Livestock development contributes to national agricultural output, so saving foreign exchange on imports, and {{can be a powerful}} stimulus to change among small and subsistence farmers. Small-scale dairying {{has been shown to be}} a harbinger of new disciplines and management practices that can be applied with great benefit in other agricultural enterprises. Agriculture in the Caribbean, in common with most ACP countries, is based mainly on crops rather than livestock. In the recent past, export crops have been predominant in terms of national priority and farmer prestige. Except in a few countries, livestock have been relegated to marginal lands and they have been farmed mostly in traditional ways to produce meat, hides and a little milk. Only in rare instances have they received supplementary feeding and other improved management techniques, such as pest and disease control on a sustained basis. Nor has livestock performance been recorded so as to permit more selective breeding and more advantageous feeding. Yet, in the Caribbean certainly, and possibly in many countries in Africa and the Pacific, the potential for improving livestock output is substantial and, with the improvement of livestock, comes the potential for the improvement of under-developed agriculture in general. As a result of the Caribbean region's specialization in export crops such as sugar, bananas, cotton, cocoa, coconut and <b>spices,</b> <b>food</b> self-sufficiency has suffered and costs of imported foods have risen. Livestock products, and feeds for livestock, now account for 53 % of the total food import bill. These imports include meat, and the full range of dairy products: liquid milk, butter and cheese. Grains and soya beans are also imported at considerable cost to feed the relatively modest livestock sector that does exist. Only recently have we begun to realise that the Caribbean is quite capable of growing excellent pasture grasses and legumes and in addition has available a range of suitable animal feed from byproducts of our traditional export crops and their associated industries. Also, the Caribbean has long had its own breeds of cattle and sheep adapted to the region and with a proven track record as milk and meat producers: the Jamaica Hope and Jamaica Red cattle, the Barbados Blackbelly sheep and the Buffalypso, a beef strain of water buffalo developed in Trinidad. Resource-poor farmers wisely avoid overdependence on any single farm enterprise and so initially livestock are required for more than one purpose: and in the case of cattle, for meat and milk. But it is milk production which may have the most interesting potential. Dairying is a challenge in that it requires high standards of management to breed and feed animals in order to achieve regular and sustained production of a sufficient quantity and quality of milk. Dairying also demands development of a collection, processing and distribution infrastructure if it is to go beyond the level- of localized self-sufficiency. But if these twin challenges (on and off the farm) are met, the benefits permeate other sectors of agricultural production, processing and distribution. Experience in Western Europe and in North America showed that the development of milk production for urban centres provided the financial, technical and management catalyst to farming in general. The most immediate benefit of milk production is the regular income it provides virtually all-year-round. To produce milk of saleable quality, disciplines of regular milking and hygiene must be practiced. Records must be kept to itemize milk sold and to identify high-yielding animals that need supplementary feeding and whose female calves should be retained for breeding. To be productive, pastures need year-round management including timely grazing, cutting for conservation and fertilizing. Since milk should be produced throughout the year, cows must be mated so that calving and lactations are spread. The farmer who is introduced to these disciplines will surely also apply them to his or her other farm enterprises. CARDI has identified three main problems that must be addressed if the Caribbean States are to achieve their potential in livestock production: the improvement of management of all classes of livestock, including control of parasites; the upgrading of livestock, particularly sheep and goats, by crossing with improved breeds; and the development of our pasture grasses, legumes and forage tree species to substitute for imported feedstuffs. A new generation of young people is entering agriculture in the Caribbean. They are open to new ideas and will respond to farming systems that offer the stimulus of more technical inputs in place of the drudgery of past agricultural practices. Where governments have provided the right incentives by managing imports and encouraging infrastructure, the signs are that our farmers are interested in developing livestock, particularly dairying, as part of their farm production and that, as a result, the entire farm output will benefit. The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CTA. Hugh Saul, {{a native of}} Guyana, qualified as a manager.
