40|$|Energy {{renovation}} is instrumental {{for reaching}} the EU 2020 goals. It {{has implications for}} growth and jobs, energy and climate and cohesion policies. Renovating existing buildings is a ‘win-win’’ option for the EU economy. In 2011, <b>specialised</b> <b>construction</b> <b>activities</b> that include renovation work and energy retrofits employed {{three times as many}} people as energy supply {{to meet the needs of}} buildings for the same value added. The phasing-out of inefficient buildings from the European building stock requires an EU renovation plan. To be successful, this plan should incorporate the existing EU policy frameworks for growth and jobs, energy and climate and those related to cohesion policies into one single framework targeting the modernisation of the overall value chain of the building sector. Converting Europe’s building stock from being an energy waster to being an energy producer would require a clear, coherent and decentralised governance structure including an Energy Renovation Facilitator and a Risk Sharing Pool cascaded at different levels of governance. Mechanisms to develop projects at scale by bundling smaller projects and to create cluster of accredited companies specialised in energy renovation would also be needed. Utility data must be unlocked and the cost of energy renovation made more transparent so that investment needs could be better assessed. A regional approach prioritising less developed regions, especially those in Member States with per capita GDPs below the EU average, is fundamental to ensuring that all EU citizens can live in comfortable homes and limiting the impact of inefficient houses on public finances and health.

40|$|Purpose – <b>Construction</b> <b>activities,</b> {{particularly}} {{related to}} transportation, have a considerable {{impact on the}} environment and air quality. This paper aims to present a geographic information systems (GIS) and computer-aided design (CAD) -based approach for visualizing, communicating and analysing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from <b>construction</b> <b>activities.</b> Design/methodology/approach – A methodology using GIS is developed to graphically represent spatial aspects of construction. The approach adopted involves use of a 3 D model developed in CAD environment, which was synchronized with a construction schedule stored in Excel spreadsheets. GIS environment is used to link spatial and scheduling information relevant to GHG emissions from <b>construction</b> <b>activities.</b> Abaseline was created to enable effective monitoring of construction emissions. Findings – The presented GIS model has the potential to enhance visualisation of distribution and dynamic variations of GHG emissions and could help stakeholders better analyse and understand how <b>construction</b> <b>activities</b> impact the environment. Originality/value – This paper presents a novel method of graphically presenting GHG and other hazardous air emissions from <b>construction</b> <b>activities</b> using a GIS-based approach. The paper presents the result of comparing the 3 D surface representation of simulated estimated and actual construction emissions to show the impact of <b>construction</b> <b>activities</b> on the environment to support the engineering analysis and decision-making process...|$|R

40|$|The reuse of {{software}} units, such as classes, components and services require professional knowledge to be performed. Today {{a multiplicity of}} different software unit technologies, supporting tools, and related activities used in reuse processes exist. Each of these relevant reuse elements may also include {{a high number of}} variations and may differ in the level and quality of necessary reuse knowledge. In such an environment of increasing variations and, therefore, an increasing need for knowledge, software engineers must obtain such knowledge to be able to perform software unit reuse activities. Today many different reuse activities exist for a software unit. Some typical knowledge intensive activities are: transformation, integration, and deployment. In addition to the problem of the amount of knowledge required for such activities, other difficulties also exist. The global industrial environment makes it challenging to identify sources of, and access to, knowledge. Typically, such sources (e. g., repositories) are made to search and retrieve information about software unitsand not about the required reuse activity knowledge for a special unit. Additionally, the knowledge has to be learned by inexperienced software engineers and, therefore, to be interpreted. This interpretation may lead to variations in the reuse result and can differ from the estimated result of the knowledge creator. This makes it difficult to exchange knowledge between software engineers or global teams. Additionally, the reuse results of reuse activities have to be repeatable and sustainable. In such a scenario, the knowledge about software reuse activities has to be exchanged without the above mentioned problems by an inexperienced software engineer. The literature shows a lack of techniques to store and subsequently distribute relevant reuse activity knowledge among software engineers. The central aim of this thesis is to enable inexperienced software engineers to use knowledge required to perform reuse activities without experiencing the aforementioned problems. The reuse activities: transformation, integration, and deployment, have been selected as the foundation for the research. Based on the construction level of handling a software unit, these activities are called Software <b>Construction</b> <b>Activities</b> (SCAcs) throughout the research. To achieve the aim, <b>specialised</b> software <b>construction</b> <b>activity</b> models have been created and combined with an abstract software unit model. As a result, different SCAc knowledge is described and combined with different software unit artefacts needed by the SCAcs. Additionally, the management (e. g., the execution of an SCAc) will be provided in a service-oriented environment. Because of the focus on reuse activities, an approach which avoids changing the knowledge level {{of software}} engineers and the abstraction view on software units and activities, the object of the investigation differs from other approaches which aim to solve the insufficient reuse activity knowledge problem. The research devised novel abstraction models to describe SCAcs as knowledge models related to the relevant information of software units. The models and the focused environment have been created using standard technologies. As a result, these were realised easily in a real world environment. Softwareengineers were able to perform single SCAcs without having previously acquired the necessary knowledge. The risk of failing reuse decreases because single activities can be performed. The analysis of the research results is based on a case study. An example of a reuse environmenthas been created and tested in a case study to prove the operational capability of the approach. The main result of the research is a proven concept enabling inexperienced software engineers to reuse software units by reusing SCAcs. The research shows the reduction in time for reuse and a decrease of learning effort is significant...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{discuss the}} {{approach}} to formulate Field Data Based Model (FDBM) for any Man Machine System. The presently observed civil <b>construction</b> <b>activities</b> are Man Machine Systems. „Man-Machine System ‟ means an activity occurring w ith the involvement of a human operator either a male and/or a female {{with the help of}} some tools used to interact with the material. The common building materials used in various activities are bricks, cement, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, water, mild steel bars, timber, marble, granite, glass etc. The construction methods are being practiced over several decades. No investigation has been made as regards appropriate use of the posture, parameters of tools and construction materials for every <b>construction</b> <b>activity.</b> It is therefore felt necessary to ascertain the scope of improvement in the method of performing a <b>construction</b> <b>activity.</b> It is necessary to form such a Field Data Based Model for deciding strengths and weaknesses of the traditional method of performing any <b>construction</b> <b>activity.</b> Once the weaknesses are known, the corrective action can be decided.
