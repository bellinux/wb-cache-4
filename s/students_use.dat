5|$|Business school rankings are {{important}} to the various business schools because they are an important marketing tool used to recruit top students, and lure recruiters from the top companies. Business schools attempt to achieve higher rankings in order that they may obtain the top students who will over the course of their careers most likely benefit the school by achieving high ranking positions, attaining great influence, and accumulating great wealth. Such students often are able to help other students attain better (higher paying, more respected and more influential) jobs. <b>Students</b> <b>use</b> the rankings to choose their school, and creators of the rankings produce them to aid in this decision.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} that the writer wants to describe the standard and the dominant standard of bibliography used by the English Department students in their thesis from 2001 to 2003 periods. The design of this study is descriptive qualitative research. The population is the English Department student’s thesis that consist 116 theses in 2001 - 2003 periods and the writer takes 17 theses as the sample. This study uses document to collect data. The document in this study is the English Department student’s thesis in 2001 to 2003 periods. Based on the data analysis, there are nine standards of bibliography used by the English Department students in their thesis from 2001 to 2003 periods. The data shows that there are 3 <b>students</b> <b>used</b> American Psychological Association (APA), 2 <b>students</b> <b>used</b> Chicago, 1 <b>student</b> <b>used</b> Turabian, 1 <b>student</b> <b>used</b> Modern Language Association (MLA), 6 <b>students</b> <b>used</b> The Team of Indonesian Department Muhammadiyah University of Malang, 1 <b>student</b> <b>used</b> Sutrisno Hadi, 1 <b>student</b> <b>used</b> Wahab and Lestari, 1 <b>student</b> <b>used</b> Soemanto, 1 <b>student</b> <b>used</b> Nasution. From the result above, the writer concludes that the English Department <b>students</b> <b>used</b> a great variety of standard of bibliography and the dominant standard used by the English Department students in their thesis is the standard created by The Team of Indonesian Department Muhammadiyah University of Malang. There are also several reasons why they used various standard of bibliography. It is hoped that the result of this study will be useful for English Department as well as the students. For English Department, it is hoped to set up standard of bibliography because it is proven that the English Department <b>students</b> <b>used</b> various standard of bibliography. It is expected that English Department and all the thesis advisors at English Department Muhammadiyah University of Malang sit together and decide what standard of bibliography should be followed. So the students who write bibliography in their thesis or other scientific writing would have uniformity...|$|R

This study attempts {{to determine the effects of}} using word-processing equipment in writing instruction. This goal was accomplished by conducting a meta-analysis of the findings of individual studies that compared the quality of writing samples of <b>students</b> <b>using</b> word-processing equipment versus <b>students</b> <b>using</b> traditional writing methods. A thorough computer and bibliography search for experimental studies that could be applied to this meta-analysis yielded over 100 "potential" article titles. After applying specific selection criteria to the studies, only 14 experiments were identified as acceptable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The 14 studies yielded 27 independent effect-size-variable statistics: 12 related to quality, 6 related to attitude, 6 related to essay length, and 3 related to quantity of revisions. Results of the meta-analysis support the following conclusions: (1) There is a small, but significant, improvement in the writing quality of those <b>students</b> <b>using</b> word-processing equipment when compared to those <b>students</b> <b>using</b> traditional writing methods. (2) There are no significant differences in the writing quality among those <b>students</b> <b>using</b> computer-prompted idea-generation word-processing equipment, <b>students</b> <b>using</b> word-processing equipment with text-analysis features, and <b>students</b> <b>using</b> only word-processing equipment. (3) There is no significant difference in the effects of using word-processing equipment on writing quality among inexperienced and experienced student writers. (4) There is a medium, significant, and negative effect in the quantity of revisions performed by <b>students</b> <b>using</b> word-processing equipment and those using traditional writing methods. (5) There is a small, significant, and positive effect in the length of essays produced by <b>students</b> <b>using</b> word-processing equipment and those using traditional writing methods.

The high school principals and the technology coordinators at all one hundred eighty (180) high schools that matched the requirement for participation were surveyed. Administrator concerns about Internet were measured with the 35 question Stages of Concern (SoC) survey. Teacher use of Internet and on-site technical assistance were measured with a 18 question section of the technology coordinator survey. <b>Student</b> <b>use</b> of Internet in school was measured with a 14 question section in both the administrator and technology coordinator surveys. ^ Significant positive correlations were found between teacher use of Internet and <b>student</b> <b>use</b> of Internet in school (. 672) and between availability of on-site technical assistance and <b>student</b> <b>use</b> of Internet in school (. 245).

25|$|In 1901, {{the village}} of Two Harbors decided it needed a high school. On February 12, 1902, Two Harbors Central High School was {{dedicated}} at a total cost of $35,025. This school was on the 400 block of Fourth Avenue. It had fifty students and three teachers. The first of these students to graduate were Mary Rylander and Ann Paulson. The school taught arithmetic, grammar, and American History. Very little English was taught at the time. In 1903 Latin and music were introduced. Courses in science and sewing were added in 1906. Manual training and domestic services were not introduced until 1908. By 1909 the school had almost doubled with ninety-eight students and seven teachers. By 1910 the school library had seven thousand books. Plans for a new building were announced in 1935, at an estimated $100,000. The original Central High School was demolished and the new building was completed in 1939. At completion, and after all additions were made, the total cost was $585,000. A referendum for a new building to be located two miles (3km) north of town on Lake County Highway 2 (CR 2) was passed in 2003. Building was completed and classes began in 2005. <b>Students</b> <b>use</b> the hiking trails in the woods, around ponds, and the football field.

30|$|The {{findings}} of the current study, however, sit with those that have not found differences between student scores following the use of adaptive quizzes.

Similarly, Griff and Matter (2013) found no statistically significant improvements in student performance by <b>students</b> <b>using</b> an adaptive learning system and those given online questions.
