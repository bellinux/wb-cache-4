40|$|The {{adequacy}} of the <b>shelflist</b> <b>count</b> for estimating {{the size of a}} libraryâ€™s holdings in a discipline was tested by determining the percentage of titles in five disciplines which were classified in Dewey or LC classes reflecting those disciplines. For some disciplines, the percentage of titles which were not classified in the relevant class letters or numbers ran as high as 70 and 80 percent. Two methods for correcting inaccurate shelflist counts are presented...|$|E
40|$|This {{report on}} {{a study of the}} {{acquisition}} policies and procedures of the Mesa College Library (Grand Junction, Colorado) begins by discussing the techniques used for data collection, including: (1) measurement of shelf:list cards; (2) calculation of average imprint date, accession date, number of circulations, price, and year of latest circulation; (3) circulation and interlibrary loan statistics; (4) reference surveys; and (5) patron questionnaires. Supply and demand proportions are then analyzed for both 207 and 21 Library of Congress divisions, and the correlation between demand percentages is discussed. Circulations by requester type and source are also analyzed. The collection development guidelines of the Colorado Commission of Higher Education (CCHE) and the American Library Association Standards for College Libraries are compared to the library's budget and collection.

40|$|The Statewide Assessment {{project was}} begun in 2000 and used an {{automated}} assessment tool called ICAS (Interactive Collection Analysis Service). ICAS uses data {{from either the}} OCLC records in an individual institution???s online catalog or the OCLC WorldCat database. ICAS provides information and reports at the levels of individual libraries, and different combinations of libraries. Our report analyzed the Illinois collection and individual library collections based on the call number ranges (quite similar to the National <b>Shelflist</b> <b>Count</b> ranges). The analysis was done by division (50 large subject areas such as Language and Literature), by category (500 call number ranges), by age, by subject (5, 000 descriptors), and by 32 languages. The counts are done by title, not item, which gives a more accurate picture of the holdings in a library by eliminating multiple copies of a title in an individual library. Studies were done by age, by uniqueness and by overlap to identify those subjects, which contain {{a large number of}} unique items and conversely by the gaps in materials present in the libraries and in the state. The project was funded by the ICCMP and by contributions from participating libraries. The final reports were delivered in the Fall of 2004.
