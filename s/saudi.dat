5|$|A <b>Saudi</b> Arabian judoka, Joud Fahmy, {{was accused}} of {{forfeiting}} her match {{in order to avoid}} competing against Gili Cohen. Fahmy, <b>Saudi</b> Arabia's news agency Al Arabiya, and the <b>Saudi</b> Olympic delegation have both stated that Fahmy forfeited because she received an injury, however other media outlets reported she was not injured.|$|E
5|$|Although the country's {{reliance}} on foreign workers {{has been a}} concern to the <b>Saudi</b> government since the mid-1950s, the situation has persisted because of a reluctance by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of <b>Saudi</b> candidates for skilled jobs. This has, in part, been blamed on the <b>Saudi</b> education system, which {{has been criticized for}} its emphasis on religion and rote learning. The <b>Saudi</b> economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks. In response, since 1995 the <b>Saudi</b> government has initiated a policy of Saudization, replacing foreign workers with <b>Saudi</b> nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of businesses with more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent <b>Saudi.</b> In the private sector, there has been a reluctance to employ Saudis and Saudization is generally considered to have been a failure. Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack social value.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1991 Gulf War, {{during which}} many U.S. Apaches {{operated}} from bases within <b>Saudi</b> territory, <b>Saudi</b> Arabia purchased twelve AH-64As for the Royal <b>Saudi</b> Land Force. It {{has been speculated}} that the <b>Saudi</b> purchase had motivated Israel to also procure the Apaches. In August 2006, the <b>Saudi</b> Arabian government began negotiations for Apache upgrades worth up to $400M, possibly remanufacturing their AH-64As to the AH-64D Longbow configuration. In September 2008, the U.S. Government approved the purchase of 12 AH-64Ds requested by <b>Saudi</b> Arabia. In October 2010, <b>Saudi</b> Arabia requested a further 70 AH-64Ds {{as part of a}} possible, massive arms deal.|$|E
5|$|He went to <b>Saudi</b> Arabia from 4 to 6 November {{in hopes}} of obtaining {{financial}} aid and securing trade agreements. However, leaked cables revealed increasingly strained relations between Zardari and <b>Saudi</b> royalty, primarily because of <b>Saudi</b> distrust of Zardari and preference for Sharif. Weaker cooperation led to decreased oil subsidies {{as part of a}} broader <b>Saudi</b> policy of withholding monetary assistance.|$|E

5|$|Most land in <b>Saudi</b> Arabia {{is owned}} by the {{government}} and only cultivated land and urban property are subject to individual ownership. All land titles must be registered, but there is no accurate information as to the extent of registration. Real estate could only be owned by <b>Saudi</b> citizens until 2000, when the property laws were amended to allow foreigners to own property in <b>Saudi</b> Arabia. Property investments by non-Saudis of more than 30 million <b>Saudi</b> riyals require approval of the Council of Ministers and foreigners remain prohibited from owning property in Medina and Mecca.|$|E
5|$|No {{political}} parties or national elections are permitted in <b>Saudi</b> Arabia {{and according to}} The Economist's 2010 Democracy Index, the <b>Saudi</b> government is the seventh most authoritarian regime from among the 167 countries rated. There is no legal protection {{of freedom of speech}} and Saudis are prohibited from publicly criticizing the government, Islam, or the royal family. The <b>Saudi</b> press is strictly censored and articles on <b>Saudi</b> dissidents are banned. <b>Saudi</b> censorship is considered among the most restrictive {{in the world and the}} country blocks broad swathes of the Internet. After protests occurred in early 2011, the government banned all public demonstrations and marches.|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 1984, two <b>Saudi</b> Arabian {{fighter pilots}} shot down two Iranian F-4 fighters. The Royal <b>Saudi</b> Air Force pilots were flying American-built F-15s and fired air-to-air {{missiles}} {{to bring down}} the Iranian planes. The <b>Saudi</b> fighter pilots had KC-135 aerial tanker planes and Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS surveillance planes assist in the encounter. The aerial fight occurred in <b>Saudi</b> airspace over the Gulf near the <b>Saudi</b> island Al Arabiyah, about 60 miles northeast of Jubail.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{from the}} first week of November 2009, <b>Saudi</b> Air Force Tornados, along with <b>Saudi</b> F-15s {{performed}} air raids during the Shia insurgency in north Yemen. It was the first time since Operation Desert Storm in 1991 that the Royal <b>Saudi</b> Air Force participated in a military operation over hostile territory. <b>Saudi</b> Air Force Tornados are playing a central role in Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} Iraqi column {{crossed the}} <b>Saudi</b> border to the East, although still along the coast, towards {{the city of}} Khafji. These Iraqi tanks were screened by the 5th Mechanized Battalion of the 2nd <b>Saudi</b> Arabian National Guard Brigade. This battalion withdrew when it came under heavy fire, {{as it had been}} ordered to not engage the Iraqi column. Elements of the 8th and 10th <b>Saudi</b> Arabian National Guard Brigades also conducted similar screening operations. Due to the order to not engage, the road to Khafji was left open. At one point, Iraqi T-55s of another column rolled up to the <b>Saudi</b> border, signaling that they intended to surrender. As they were approached by <b>Saudi</b> Arabian troops, they reversed their turrets and opened fire. This prompted air support from a nearby AC-130, destroying 13 vehicles.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{attack on}} the city was called off after the Iraqi {{occupants}} opened up with heavy fire, prompting the Saudis to reinforce the 7th Battalion with two more companies from adjacent <b>Saudi</b> units. The attempt to retake the city had been preceded by a 15-minute preparatory fire from U.S. Marine artillery. However Iraqi fire did manage to destroy one <b>Saudi</b> V-150 armored personnel carrier.|$|E
5|$|Arab {{countries}} politically supported China in the OIC with especially <b>Saudi</b> Arabia and Egypt helping China squash {{any potential}} anti-Chinese motion by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation on the Uyghurs, Egypt viewed {{its own internal}} sectarian problems like China's and Sudan was also concerned about external interference in its internal problems as well, while Indonesia {{had to deal with}} its own internal Islamists and emphasized that there was no religious conflict but instead ethnic based disturbances in Xinjiang to calm the situation down. Pakistan, <b>Saudi</b> Arabia, and Egypt helped China kill off a statement on the Xinjiang situation in the OIC. There has been no public reaction by the Arab League, <b>Saudi</b> Arabia and Iran on the situation and China has built stronger relations with Iran and <b>Saudi</b> Arabia due to their influence in the Islamic world.|$|E
5|$|Between 1996 and 2000, <b>Saudi</b> Arabia acceded to four UN {{human rights}} {{conventions}} and, in 2004, the government approved {{the establishment of}} the National Society for Human Rights (NSHR), staffed by government employees, to monitor their implementation. To date, the activities of the NSHR have been limited and doubts remain over its neutrality and independence. <b>Saudi</b> Arabia was one of only eight countries that did not accept the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights when it was launched in 1948. Now, only <b>Saudi</b> Arabia remains openly opposed to the declaration. In response to the continuing criticism of its human rights record, the <b>Saudi</b> government points to the special Islamic character of the country, and asserts that this justifies a different social and political order.|$|E
5|$|Chad is home {{to foreign}} missionaries {{representing}} both Christian and Islamic groups. Itinerant Muslim preachers, primarily from Sudan, <b>Saudi</b> Arabia, and Pakistan, also visit. <b>Saudi</b> Arabian funding generally supports social and educational projects and extensive mosque construction.|$|E
5|$|Distressed by the {{occupation}} of Khafji, <b>Saudi</b> commander General Khaled bin Sultan appealed to American General Norman Schwarzkopf for an immediate air campaign against Iraqi forces {{in and around the}} city. However this was turned down because the buildings would make it difficult for aircraft to spot targets without getting too close. It was instead decided that the city would be retaken by Arab ground forces. The task fell to the 2nd <b>Saudi</b> Arabian National Guard Brigade's 7th Battalion, composed of <b>Saudi</b> infantry and two Kuwaiti tank companies attached to the task force. These were supported by U.S. Army Special Forces and Marine Reconnaissance personnel.|$|E
5|$|During {{high school}} and college, Shehri was deeply {{religious}} and attended Al-Seqley Mosque, which his family had built as the local mosque. Shehri also frequented government-supported religious camps in <b>Saudi</b> Arabia. At this time, there were strong religious feelings in <b>Saudi</b> Arabia, especially in the Asir region. Many {{young people in the}} region idolized Osama bin Laden, who had family ties to the area. Wail's father was a friend of Bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi, who were both hijackers on United Airlines Flight 93, came from the same area in <b>Saudi</b> Arabia as the Shehri family.|$|E

5|$|From his {{headquarters}} in Tampa, Schwarzkopf began planning the operations to defend <b>Saudi</b> Arabia. Lieutenant General Charles Horner, USAF, ran the headquarters in Riyadh. Schwarzkopf planned supply lines for the 50,000 troops initially sent to <b>Saudi</b> Arabia, tapping Major General William G. Pagonis {{as director of}} the logistical operations, with U.S. Air Force cargo aircraft landing supplies at Dhahran and U.S. Navy ships offloading troops and supplies at Dammam. By August 20, 20,000 U.S. troops were in <b>Saudi</b> Arabia, with another 80,000 preparing to deploy, and a further 40,000 reserves tapped to augment them. Schwarzkopf arrived at the CENTCOM command in Riyadh on August 25, and on August 29 he conducted his first front-line tour of the potential combat zone, accompanied by reporters. Over the next several weeks, Schwarzkopf spoke frequently with both reporters and troops under his command, conducting many high-profile press conferences and updates to the situation in <b>Saudi</b> Arabia. Schwarzkopf worked to help coordinate the contributions of the different nations contributing military forces to the effort. By mid-October, Schwarzkopf indicated he was confident the forces were of a sufficient level that they could defend <b>Saudi</b> Arabia if it was attacked. Through October, Schwarzkopf and his command were occupied with setting up facilities and supply lines for the troops streaming into <b>Saudi</b> Arabia. He also worked to minimize the culture clash among foreigners in sharia-dominated <b>Saudi</b> Arabia, such as the high visibility of women in military roles. Schwarzkopf remained at his command in Riyadh through December, making frequent frontline visits to the troops. On December 29, 1990, he received a warning order from The Pentagon to be ready to attack into Iraq and Kuwait by January 17.|$|E
5|$|Human {{rights issues}} and failings {{in the rule}} of law in <b>Saudi</b> Arabia have {{attracted}} strong criticism. These include criminal law punishments that are considered as cruel, as well as the position of women, religious discrimination, the lack of religious freedom and the activities of the <b>Saudi</b> Mutaween.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, France {{was able}} to gain a {{contract}} with <b>Saudi</b> Arabia over the purchase of 190 AMX-30S', designed for the desert environment of the Middle Eastern nation. Named the Palmier Contract, <b>Saudi</b> Arabia's tanks were delivered between 1973 and 1979, while 59 AMX-30Ds were exported between 1975 and 1979, 12 AMX-30Ps between 1977 and 1979, and finally 51 self-propelled howitzers, delivered between 1979 and 1980. Between 1979 and 1981, <b>Saudi</b> Arabia also received 52 AMX-30SAs and later 50 AMX-30C1 Shanine-2s delivered in two batches, between 1980 and 1989. By the 21st century, 50% of <b>Saudi</b> Arabia's AMX-30 fleet were in storage, given that the AMX-30 lacked the capabilities to deal with more modern threats, such as against Iraqi T-62s and T-72s, and Israeli Merkava tanks. These were largely displaced by an order for 315 M1A2 Abrams tanks in 1989, and the acquisition of 450 M60A3 Patton tanks. Although <b>Saudi</b> Arabia planned to procure more M1 tanks, it was {{unable to do so}} for financial reasons and the AMX-30 has still not been retired.|$|E

5|$|In November 2009, the Royal <b>Saudi</b> Land Force, {{as part of}} a {{military}} effort against insurgent intrusions of the kingdom's border, started using the Apache in Operation Scorched Earth; this also involved launching air strikes against Houthi rebels operating inside neighboring Yemen. In January 2010 the rebels claimed to have shot down an Apache; this was denied by the <b>Saudi</b> military. In late January 2010, the leader of the Shiite rebels announced their withdrawal from <b>Saudi</b> territory, this announcement followed a key battle on 12 January when <b>Saudi</b> forces reportedly took control of the border village of Al Jabiri.|$|E

5|$|<b>Saudi</b> Arabia is an {{absolute}} monarchy, and has no legally binding written constitution. However, in 1992, the Basic Law of <b>Saudi</b> Arabia was adopted by royal decree.

It declares that the king must comply with Sharia (that is, Islamic law) and that the Quran and the Sunna (the traditions of Muhammad) are the country's constitution. Interpretation of the Quran and the Sunna remains necessary, and this is carried out by the ulema, the <b>Saudi</b> religious establishment.|$|E

5|$|<b>Saudi</b> law recognizes only {{corporate}} or partnership entities established under Sharia or the <b>Saudi</b> Company Law of 1982. A {{contract with}} {{any other type of}} company will be void and the persons who made the contract in the company's name will be personally liable for it. Under Sharia, corporations can take a number of forms, but the most common in <b>Saudi</b> Arabia is Sharikat Modarabah where some partners contribute assets and others contribute expertise. In addition, the Company Law (which is based on Egyptian company law) identifies eight permissible forms of corporate entity including joint ventures, and limited liability partnerships.|$|E
