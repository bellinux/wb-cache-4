6000|$|IMPALE, v.t. In popular usage {{to pierce}} with any weapon which remains fixed in the wound.

40|$|Before {{the trains}} of thought have been firmly laid down, we ask {{in this article}} about the very nature and {{histories}} of the speculative of the speculative-materialist turn. We do this from the intertwined interfaces of curious feminist materialisms, foregrounding sexual difference, post-positivist critique and posthumanist performativity such as is being done in various strands of feminist theory today (new materialist feminism, new feminist science studies, feminist posthumanities etc.). The question of speculation plays a constitutive role in feminist critique and in several new or neo-materialist traditions. In fact, many interesting materialisms—Marxism, French feminism—can be named ‘speculative’. We argue {{that in spite of}} what the recent ‘speculative turn’ professes, speculative materialisms have a complex genealogy. Speculation functions transversally in a materialist genealogy (dis) -connecting the archive of feminist approaches in particular. In {{order to be able to}} imagine a different (feminist) world we need to think through a stifled and sexually differentiated present from which a qualitative shift and political breakthrough can be formulated, and hopefully achieved.

500|$|The Icelandic Draugur (plural draugar) {{is usually}} {{translated}} as [...] "ghost", but unlike mainland ghosts Icelandic undead {{were believed to}} be corporeal. Icelandic scholars such as Úlfhildur Dagsdóttir and Ármann Jakobsson [...] have argued that the Icelandic draugur has more in common with the eastern-European vampire than it has with most beings categorized as ghosts. According to Ármann medieval Icelandic undead can be put into two categories. The first being [...] "Varðmenn" [...] or guardians, which are undead that stay in a certain place, usually their burial mound or home, and protect it and their treasures from thieves and trespassers. These draugar are depicted as being driven by greed and unwillingness to part with their worldy belongings and are in many way similar to dragons. The second category are [...] "tilberadraugar"(A tilberi is a type of undead in Icelandic folklore, a human rib given life by drinking the blood of a witch and then sent out to steal milk and money.), parasitic ghosts who roam the earth and harass the living and try to drive them mad or even kill them, often by dragging them into their graves, and thereby turn their victims into more draugar. This comparison of Icelandic draugar to vampires is not entirely new as it was also made by Andrew Lang in 1897 when he called the draugur Glámr in Grettir's Saga a vampire. There is also some similarity in the methods used to destroy draugar as those used against alleged vampires. Decapitation of the suspected corpse was common as was driving nails or sharp <b>stakes</b> into the <b>body</b> to pin it down or into the grave.|$|R
5000|$|Samuel Brady gained his lasting notoriety for his leap {{over the}} Cuyahoga River around 1780 {{in what is}} now Kent, Ohio.

To avoid capture, Brady leaped across a 22 ft wide gorge of the river (which was widened considerably in the 1830s for construction of the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal) and fled to a nearby lake where he hid in the water under a fallen tree using a reed for air. [...] The lake, originally known as [...] "Brady's Lake", is now known as Brady Lake and is the location of a former village of the same name, Brady Lake, Ohio, which celebrated [...] "Captain Brady Day" [...] each summer from 1972 to 2006. The site of Brady's leap is today a park known as [...] "Brady's Leap Park" [...] just north of downtown Kent, Ohio.Captain Samuel Brady and his Rangers were in pursuit of a band of Sandusky Indians, {{in what is now}} the State of Ohio. He and his Rangers ambushed them close to what is now Brady's Lake, killing most of them. However, a larger force of Indians arrived on the scene when the fight was at its height. After a long battle, Captain Brady’s Rangers were overwhelmed. Some of his men managed to hide and escape death or capture, but most were killed and, of course, scalped. The Indians took Captain Brady prisoner. They did not kill him outright, because they wanted to make the death of their arch enemy an event. They notified other Indian tribes in the area that a [...] "general jubilee of rejoicing" [...] was to be held.When [...] "the great day dawned and from far and near the chiefs with their tribes assembled, to see the most frightful tortures inflicted on their enemy.

Some accounts claim that the heat enabled him to break his bonds, but it was probably due to his wonderful physical strength. Stripped of his clothing, he dashed madly across the flame of fire, according to one writer, seized a squaw, the wife of a noted chief, according to other historians her child, threw her into the fire, and in the attendant turmoil caused by his desperate deed, he made good his escape." ...|$|R
60|$|Years {{passed away}} after years, and a century had elapsed ere a noble Swedish rover, bound upon some high {{adventure}} {{and supported by}} a gallant band of followers, arrived in the valley which took {{its name from the}} tomb of the brethren-in-arms. The story was told to the strangers, whose leader determined on opening the sepulchre, partly because, as already hinted, it was reckoned a heroic action to brave the anger of departed heroes by violating their tombs; partly to attain the arms and swords of proof with which the deceased had done their great actions. He set his soldiers to work, and soon removed the earth and stones {{from one side of the}} mound, and laid bare the entrance. But the stoutest of the rovers started back when, instead of the silence of a tomb, they heard within horrid cries, the clash of swords, the clang of armour, and all the noise of a mortal combat between two furious champions. A young warrior was let down into the profound tomb by a cord, which was drawn up shortly after, in hopes of news from beneath. But when the adventurer descended, some one threw him from the cord, and took his place in the noose. When the rope was pulled up, the soldiers, instead of their companion, beheld Asmund, the survivor of the brethren-in-arms. He rushed into the open air, his sword drawn in his hand, his armour half torn from his body, the left side of his face almost scratched off, as by the talons of some wild beast. He had no sooner appeared in the light of day, than, with the improvisatory poetic talent, which these champions often united with heroic strength and bravery, he poured forth a string of verses containing the history of his hundred years' conflict within the tomb. It seems that no sooner was the sepulchre closed than the corpse of the slain Assueit arose from the ground, inspired by some ravenous goule, and having first torn to pieces and devoured the horses which had been entombed with them, threw himself upon the companion who had just given him such a sign of devoted friendship, in order to treat him in the same manner. The hero, no way discountenanced by the horrors of his situation, took to his arms, and defended himself manfully against Assueit, or rather against the evil demon who tenanted that champion's body. In this manner the living brother waged a preternatural combat, which had endured during a whole century, when Asmund, at last obtaining the victory, prostrated his enemy, and by driving, as he boasted, a <b>stake</b> through his <b>body,</b> had finally reduced him to the state of quiet becoming a tenant of the tomb. Having chanted the triumphant account of his contest and victory, this mangled conqueror fell dead before them. The body of Assueit was taken out of the tomb, burnt, and the ashes dispersed to heaven; whilst that of the victor, now lifeless and without a companion, was deposited there, so that it was hoped his slumbers might remain undisturbed.[19] The precautions taken against Assueit's reviving a second time, remind us of those adopted in the Greek islands and in the Turkish provinces against the vampire. It affords also a derivation of the ancient English law in case of suicide, when a stake was driven through the body, originally to keep it secure in the tomb.|$|R
40|$| {{appear to}} have been to Boston and Salem, where he became fascinated by the {{witchcraft}} and folklore of the latter. This interest led to the writing of his very first book, "The Legends of New England", followed by "The Supernaturalism of New England". A few years later he knew of all the legends of Hampton and used many these in tale and poem. Two of the nine tales in the "Tent" poems concern the Hampton witch, Goody Cole, who was buried with a <b>stake</b> through her <b>body</b> to keep her down. The young poet was also impressed by the tales of men married to beautiful women who were actually evil demons and in time destroyed their husbands. On trips to the village to bring the farm produce in exchange for household commodities, Whittier observed keenly the tavern proprietor, the country storekeeper, the blacksmith, the man who sold combs and cigars, and the widow who made his homespun trousers and coats; and as he observed these characters they became so well imprinted in his mind, that he later used them in his poetry. Thus the monotony {{of the life of the}} early New England farmer was broken not only by the beauties of nature but by their diversions which were a combination of work and play [...] -corn-husking, quitting parties, story telling, and games. Thus, Whittier's background was respectable and in conformity with the times. The third chapter covers the influence of Whittier's environment in his life. Since Haverhill and Amesbury resemble each other geographically and socially both shall be considered as one huge territory in determining their influences on Whittier. Whittier, being the son of Quaker parents, was undoubtedly brought up under stern laws. The Haverhill farm house where Whittier was born and passed his boyhood, survives with little change. The isolation of the home, and the meagre supply of books in the household, offered neither companionship nor entertainment and perhaps as a result his aesthetic mind was lulled into dreaming. In his boyhood Whittier toiled with his hands, studied by the fireplaces, and attended the district school and the academy. Whittier was country born, bred, and educated; he was a Haverhill boy and an Amesbury man who never broke the ties of family and neighbor, and thus became directly typical of his town and district, and indirectly typical of folk, race, and nation, who lived the same simple life. He was just a native writer stimulated by his natural environment and the local forces to which he was subjected. The Haverhill farmhouse, its various, and different members of his household, he has portrayed very accurately and strikingly in "Snow-Bound". Near the house glides a little brook to which he refers a number of times in his writings. "The music of whose liquid lip Had been to us companionship, And in our lonely life had grown To have an almost human tone. " (Thos. D. Murphy, Op. Cit., pp. 201 - 203.) Between the years 1836 to 1892 the poet made his home in Amesbury and it was here that he wrote most of his works. If environment develops the innate and characteristic genius which nature has stamped upon each man, then the environments of Whittier were fitted to make him the child of nature. From his rustic glen he emerged as a man with strong tendencies: first in his New England life interpretations; second his beliefs of freedom; and third upon the mystery of human emotions when seeking God. It would be hard to find on the earth's surface a concentration of more diversified industry than in the county of Essex, in Massachusetts [...] -manufacturing, commerce, fishing, and farming. So Whittier was by birthright the poet of the farmer, the shoemaker, and the mechanic. (Thos. D. Murphy, Op. Cit., pp. 194 - 195.) The legends, of the people about Indians, witch-craft, and supernatural occurrences, inspired Whittier to repeople the region and preserve their legends in verse. Whittier loved the Merrimack, and all the lakes and ponds of his territory, because they inspired him and in return for the beauty they offered him, he made them become celebrated forever. All through his life Whittier kept warm reminiscences of his earlier years of which he often speaks in his poetry: "Crowding years in one brief moon, When all things I heard or saw, Me, their master, waited for. " Whittier's work is crowded with pictures of rural life. Nothing was more pleasing to him than to lie beside the little brook and listen to its ripple, for which he has made many poetic remarks: "laughed the brook for my delight Through the day and through the night, Whispering at the garden wall, Talked with me from fall to fall. " The barefooted farmer's boy, who helped with the farm chores, used the language he had always heard and spoken, a pure English speech with a few dialectic peculiarities. His poetry was widely read because he wrote in rustic language which rustics like himself could understand. Soon he abandoned all interests in the writing of nature poems, in favor of the vital cause of the century [...] -anti-slavery. To this cause he devoted his time, and means without any consideration to himself. Finally at the close of the Civil Wart anti-slavery struggle ended, and Whittier emerged triumphant, for the dream of the abolitionists materialized. (Martin W. Hoyt [...] "Rambles in Whittier-Land"; Published by the Granite State Publishing Co.; 1912; pp. 36, 37.) Every part of this valley is commemorated in Whittier's prose and verse writings. When Washington "drew reign" under the sycamore trees, Whittier repeats the legend that he said: "I have aeen no prospect fairer In this goodly Eastern land. " "Whittier held firmly to the faith in which he was educated and did not like to see the Friends adopting methods of other denominations. He loved beat the old Quaker meetings in which the silence was not broken. When reference was made to the Quaker misuse of grammer, he would say that it had been the manner of speech of his people for two centuries, and he clung to it because it was his mother's language. He upheld the doctrine of his sect to the end. Whittier's skill in his editorial work, in managing conventions, influencing legislation, and his interest in abolition, gave him prominence among the party leaders. Thus, while Whittier at the fields indulged in day dreaming. Nature was storing his mind with a wealth of material, from which he drew with lavish hand that he might bestow it upon those whose souls are less keen to note her wonderful harmonies. " (Martin. W. Hoyt [...] "Rambles in Whittier-land"; Published by the Granite State Publishing Co.; Manchester, N. H.; 1912, p. 10.) The fourth chapter or the "Conclusion", consists of brief deductions of what has already been said in the thesis. Chapter five consists of the Abstract followed by Appendixes A and B which are brief historical sketches of Haverhill and Amesbury, and these are followed by the Bibliography. [URL]...|$|R
