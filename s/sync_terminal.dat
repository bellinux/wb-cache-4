50|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{dangerous}} loops when connecting equipment in complex studio setups, better adapters offer voltage protection and galvanic isolation of the units. Such adapters will ensure {{that there is no}} electrical connection of any kind between both sides of the adapter, including ground. They either use transformers or opto-couplers to transfer the trigger impulse from the camera to the flash. Their electronics cannot be powered from the flash and therefore needs a power supply in form of a small battery.As an example, Minolta offered the PC terminal adapter PCT-100 (8825-691) for this purpose, which worked as a galvanic isolator and could withstand 400 volts DC or AC. The similar Sony flash <b>sync</b> <b>terminal</b> and ISO hotshoe adapters FA-ST1AM and FA-HS1AM offer galvanic isolation as well, but can withstand voltages up to 60 volts DC or AC only.|$|E
50|$|The Mamiya C {{series is}} a line of twin-lens reflex medium-format system cameras {{manufactured}} by Mamiya between 1956 and 1994. It was developed from the Mamiyaflex series of cameras built from 1949 to 1956. The Mamiya C series was initially aimed at the professional market, but some later models were intended for amateurs. Unlike most TLR cameras, the Mamiya C has interchangeable lenses. The upper and lower lenses come off as a unit, and are available in at least seven different focal lengths. The lower lens of each unit has an aperture diaphragm {{as well as a}} leaf shutter. A flash <b>sync</b> <b>terminal</b> is part of the lens unit, and the delay can be set to M or X mode. The camera has an interlocking baffle that enables lenses to be changed without exposing the film. Focusing is done via a bellows system on the front side of the camera. Early models had separate film advance and shutter cocking mechanisms; on later models the shutter was automatically cocked. There is no metering in the camera body, so an external light meter is necessary. Viewfinders with built-in meters were available as accessories with later models.|$|E

50|$|The Mamiya Press {{is a line}} of medium-format {{rangefinder}} system camera {{manufactured by}} Mamiya. The first model was introduced in 1960, and the final model was discontinued in the 1970s. It was targeted at the professional press photography market, and {{a wide array of}} accessories was offered. The maximum image size that can be captured is 6 cm Ã— 9 cm, but images can be taken {{in a number of different}} formats, and using several types of film. All of the lenses have leaf shutters, which are released on the lens itself, not through the body as is typical with most cameras. The shutter is typically triggered from one of several models of removable grips, all of which have a built-in release cable. The lenses also have flash <b>sync</b> <b>terminals.</b> The camera lacks an internal dark slide, so one has to be inserted into the film holder before changing the lens.|$|R

40|$|A {{breadboard}} <b>sync</b> satellite <b>terminal</b> {{has been}} developed incorporating a unique concept of a gimballess multi-access transceiver, which is capable of simultaneously communicating with six independent, asynchronous LEO satellites. The developmental hardware illustrates that low power, weight, and volume is achievable compared to multiple independent gimballed transceivers, while also putting a lesser burden of power, size, and weight on the LEO satellite tranceivers that communicate with the multiple-access transceiver...|$|R
