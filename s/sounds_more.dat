5|$|Join Hands {{took the}} topic of the First World War as its inspiration. Musically, it is darker than the band's debut album The Scream: it <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> claustrophobic and more haunting. It was the last album with the band's first {{recorded}} line-up, as guitarist John McKay and drummer Kenny Morris quit the group after a disagreement {{at the beginning of the}} British Join Hands tour, on the day of the album's release.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound effects}} were {{designed}} by Star Wars veteran Ben Burtt. Whereas the phaser blast noises from the television series were derived from The War of the Worlds (1953), Burtt made his phaser <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> like his blasters from Star Wars, because Abrams' depiction of phasers were closer to the blasters' bullet-like fire, rather than the steady beams of energy in previous Star Trek films. Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: he tapped a long spring against a contact microphone, and combined that with cannon fire. Burtt used a 1960s oscillator to create a musical and emotional hum to the warping and transporting sounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{lyrics are}} quite personal. I like rap music, and rappers use real-life {{language}} and don’t hold back {{in what they}} talk about. My lyrics aren’t generic pop lyrics just there because they rhyme. I’ve tried to write things as I’d say them, so it <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> like me. There’s a song called Sticks And Stones, which is about when I was 17 and I thought I’d won the jackpot when I got in the band , and then things not turning out as I might have expected. The middle eight on that song is very honest and truthful.|$|E

25|$|The Lemhi Shoshone {{call her}} Sacajawea. It {{is derived from}} the Shoshone word for her name, Saca tzah we yaa. In his Cash Book, William Clark spells Sacajawea with a “J”. Also, William Clark and Private George Shannon {{explained}} to Nicholas Biddle (Published the first Lewis and Clark Journals in 1814) about the pronunciation of her name and how the tz <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> like a “j”. What better authority on the pronunciation of her name than Clark and Shannon who traveled with her and constantly heard the pronunciation of her name? We do not believe it is a Minnetaree (Hidatsa) word for her name. Sacajawea was a Lemhi Shoshone not a Hidatsa.|$|E
25|$|The {{album was}} re-released as a 2-disc 'Deluxe Edition' on 22 October 2012. The second disc {{includes}} the album re-recorded, with each song {{performed in a}} different style, including acoustic performances. It was recorded at Regal House Studio in Cambridgeshire, and produced by Lee Batiuk, with Chris Pennells and Lee Wilson involved in the recording process unlike the original release, after the band were inspired to experiment with their sound by performing at St Pancras International railway station {{as part of the}} Station Sessions. This was the same studio where the drums were recorded for the original release. Speaking about the Station Sessions performance, which was an acoustic 'stripped down' performance, James Veck-Gilodi explained; 'we thought we sounded better than we did as a rock band' and noted that 'it's nice to make music that <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> like the music I listen to'. The release will feature banjo, mandolin and piano.|$|E
500|$|The Deluxe Edition was {{released}} as a two-disc CD on September 23, 2003. [...] It contains the same songs, {{in a slightly}} different order, as The Fillmore Concerts, and one additional track, [...] "Midnight Rider". [...] The Deluxe Edition is based on the master recordings for At Fillmore East and Eat a Peach, and so it <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> similar to those albums than The Fillmore Concerts does.|$|E
2500|$|During 1959, Irvine and Elliott also {{recorded}} audio tapes to send Guthrie and, after recording one of Guthrie's songs, Elliott exclaimed: [...] "Andy, you <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> like Woody than I do!", just as Guthrie had {{once said to}} Elliott: [...] "Jack, you <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> like me than I do!". However, Irvine's dream to join Guthrie in the States eventually faded when his mother died in 1961.|$|R

This vocalisation {{can also be used}} at social meetings, during courtship, or in attempting to find another; the chirp of a mother searching for her cubs, which <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> like the yelp of a dog than the chirp of a bird, can be heard up to [...] away. A study estimated the chirp's total duration as 0.09 to 0.5 seconds.|$|E
500|$|... "Suga Mama" [...] is a {{moderate}} R and soul song that displays influences of the 1960s {{as well as}} 1970s funk and rock music. It also song contains limited elements of the 1980s go-go and <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> closely resembling live music than Knowles' previous recordings. According to the sheet music published by Hal Leonard Corporation, [...] "Suga Mama" [...] was composed using common time in the key of G minor, with {{a moderate}} tempo of 94 beats per minute.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{were also}} {{impressed}} with her lyrical ability. Jon Caramanica of Rolling Stone gave the album 3 stars stating, [...] "When she really gets her hands dirty, Kim <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> forceful and engaged than she's been in years". However, some critics felt {{the album was}} too long and contained too many fillers. Birchmeier of AllMusic stated the album {{could use a little}} [...] "trimming". Brett Berliner of Stylus Magazine said, [...] "I enjoy about eight songs on this album, but they're tracks I only feel like listening to from time to time".|$|E

2500|$|A {{specific}} type of phasing, flanging is a similar effect, in which the notches are linearly spaced. In a flanger effect, the notches are created by mixing the signal with a delayed version of itself. Flangers tend to <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> pronounced and natural, like the [...] "jet plane whoosh" [...] effect, whereas phasers tend to <b>sound</b> <b>more</b> subtle and otherworldly. For comparison of the two effects, check flanging.|$|R
500|$|... "I {{just wanted}} to create and do {{something}} different and branch out. At {{the heart of it}} I know it's still Evanescence and it's still me, but structurally it's a lot more fun. We went {{a lot of different ways}} with it instead of constantly sticking to the same structure and the same pop formula. I think it's more mature and more brave all around; it's like the instruments actually go together, the piano and guitar and vocals, since they're written together -- they intertwine. It's definitely even more personal. At least for me, because I was there, it <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> fun because I was having so much more fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Changes in the {{approach}} and storytelling of the show {{in the second and}} subsequent seasons led to more positive critical reception and made it a media favorite. Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "The best new show of the year took a few weeks to grow on me, but now it's a full-blown addiction." [...] The Los Angeles Times called Walter Bishop one of the best characters of 2008, noting, [...] "the role of the modern-day mad scientist could so easily have been a disaster, but the 'Fringe' writers and the masterful John Noble have conspired to create a character that seems, as trite as it <b>sounds,</b> <b>more</b> Shakespearean than sci-fi." ...|$|E

Michael Andor Brodeur from The Boston Globe commented that [...] "Cher's 'Goddess of Pop' sash remains in little danger of undue snatching; at 67, she <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> convincing than J-Lo or Madonna reporting from 'the club'". Cher premiered the lead single [...] "Woman's World" [...] on the season four finale of the talent show The Voice, her first live TV performance in over a decade. She later joined the show's season five as judge Blake Shelton's team adviser.|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, Dean Carlson said that Spiderland is [...] "one {{of the most}} essential and chilling releases in the mumbling post-rock arena". However, he felt that it is [...] "slightly overrated" [...] and that McMahan's vocals convey [...] "strangled pity instead of outright empathy." [...] Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic and wrote that, despite their [...] "sad-sack affect", Slint are actually [...] "art-rockers without the courage of their pretensions" [...] with poor lyrics. In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rolling Stone journalist Mac Randall felt that the album's music lacks songform, even though it <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> accessible than Tweez: [...] "he absence of anything resembling a tune continues to nag." ...|$|E
500|$|Chuck Taylor of Billboard gave a {{negative}} review for the song, criticizing Madonna's rapping and calling the song [...] "a blurry snarl {{of style and}} composition that's <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> like a disjointed medley than a song." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian was disappointed by the lyrics saying that [...] "what on earth might her extreme point of view involve? That the world is ruled by a shadowy cabal of super-intelligent lizards?... Sadly not. Her extreme point of view {{turns out to be}} that money can't buy you happiness and that fame isn't all it's cracked up to be." [...] He also panned the lyric [...] "I like to express my extreme point of view", saying that it's difficult to hear that line without feeling a prickle of excitement.|$|E
500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> like a children's lullaby than a pop song. A baroque and {{psychedelic}} pop song, {{it begins with}} the sound of strings, ushering a joyous melody, with Madonna singing in a full voice. The verses are sung without any background vocals to accompany Madonna's voice. However, in the chorus, when she sings the lines, [...] "Pink elephants and lemonades, Dear Jessie hear the laughter raining on your love-parade", a different set of vocals are interwoven with hers, continuously chanting the words [...] "La-la". Synthesizer and strummed acoustics are added during the second verse, followed by the repetition of the chorus, when a change in tempo and time signature occurs, followed by the sound of a child's laughter.|$|E

500|$|... "Cowboy Style" [...] was {{recorded}} at Real World Studios, Sarm West and DMC Studios in London, England and was mixed by Alan Bremner at Real World. Instrumentally, Greg Bones and Anderson played the guitar, Johnnie Hardie played the fiddle, {{and all other}} instrumentals played by Anderson. [...] "Cowboy Style" [...] is a Celtic pop song that lasts a duration of four minutes and forty-four seconds. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that [...] "Cowboy Style features a tribal percussion break and a string quartet that <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> Celtic than country." [...] Online music critic Adrian Denning compared the song {{to the work of}} Icelandic recording artist and songwriter Björk. Nick Levine from Digital Spy said [...] "Oh, and in 'Cowboy Style', it has a track that manages to sound a little bit Celtic and a little bit Middle Eastern. Pete Waterman must have wept." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{also makes}} use of piano keys and guitar strings. Rihanna's vocal range in the song spans from the lower note of G3 to the higher note of C5. Mackay noted that the singer adopts a [...] "melancholic pop vocal" [...] for the {{duration}} of the song. Chad Grischow of IGN stated that Rihanna appears to be screaming the vocals during the hook, citing the key of the [...] "jittery dance beat" [...] as the reason for oversinging. However, Grischow commented that the singer <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> pleasant to listen to during the verses, writing: [...] "The song actually sounds great when the light, plucky verses are quietly building to the hook, allowing her to sing rather than shout." [...] Rihanna sings about the complications of a relationship, as well as how the protagonist can experience mood swings, whereby his or her feelings frequently change toward their lover.|$|E
500|$|In 1996 CMJ New Music Monthly wrote: [...] "His Red Headed Stranger was the Sgt. Pepper's {{of country}} music, the first record {{to follow a}} {{coherent}} theme instead of merely compiling radio singles". AllMusic described Red Headed Stranger as [...] "really elusive, as the themes get a little muddled and the tunes themselves are a bit bare. It's undoubtedly distinctive – and it <b>sounds</b> <b>more</b> distinctive {{with each passing year}} – but it's strictly an intellectual triumph and, after a pair of albums that were musically and intellectually sound, it's a bit of a letdown, no matter how successful it was". In 2003 it was included among the top 1,000 albums of Zagat Survey magazine, and was rated five stars out of five. The magazine wrote, [...] "Supporters (of the album) spread the gospel that it's just a quintessential outlaw recording, but perhaps the greatest country album ever with a spare style that changed the way C was played".|$|E
