5000|$|KWS SAAT SE (ISIN: DE0007074007) is an independent, family-owned German {{company that}} focuses on plant breeding, with {{activities}} in about 70 countries. KWS is the fifth largest seed producer worldwide based on sales. The product range includes seed varieties for sugar beet, corn, cereals, rapeseed and potatoes. The capital letters [...] "K," [...] "W" [...] and [...] "S" [...] in the name KWS stand for Klein Wanzlebener Saatzucht, which means <b>seed</b> <b>breeding</b> from Klein Wanzleben. The company’s original headquarters were in Klein Wanzleben, an East German town located {{near the city of}} Magdeburg. Its main markets are in the temperate climate zones of Europe, North and South America as well as North Africa and Asia. KWS has a network of more than 30 <b>breeding</b> <b>stations,</b> 130 testing stations and around 60 subsidiaries. In 1954, the company went public on the Hamburg-Hannover Stock Exchange and has been on the SDAX list of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since June 2006.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the Wireless Sensors Network (WSN) and the Internet of Things (IOT) {{are widely}} used in {{providing}} decision support systems which solve many problems in the real-world. This paper presents IoT {{as the best way}} to solve the agricultural problems, related to seedbed resources optimization, decision making support and <b>seed</b> <b>breeding</b> monitoring. This case study provides real-time information about the seedbed that will help agriculturists make the right decisions during the <b>seed</b> <b>breeding</b> procedure. Using the basic principles of Internet and WSN technology, precision agriculture systems based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology are explained in detail, especially in network architecture, hardware architecture and software process control of the precision <b>seed</b> <b>breeding</b> monitoring system. The implemented automation system monitors data from the sensors in a feedback loop which activates the control devices based on threshold value. The implementation of WSN in seedbed monitoring (SM) will optimize the control of air temperature and humidity, soil humidity, air capacity, luminance while it will minimize the time of <b>seed</b> <b>breeding</b> and it will also maximize the number of seeds which become plants ready for transplantation...|$|R

The day blindness mutation was detected in all studied flocks. The overall allele and genotype frequencies of all studied flocks of the day blindness mutation were 0. 088 and 17. 49 %, respectively. The genotype and allele frequencies were higher in station flocks than the farmer flocks (0. 121, 24. 15 and 0. 012, 2. 32, respectively).
