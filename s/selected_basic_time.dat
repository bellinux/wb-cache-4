40|$|Hybrid Simulation with Dynamic Substructuring (HSDS) {{defines a}} class of hybrid numerical-experimental {{techniques}} capable of simulating the nonlinear response of a dynamic system. As far as complexity of emulated structures grows, the role of integration algorithms {{becomes more and more}} crucial. In fact, today control systems run at sampling times of the order of 1 ms. Therefore, new displacement commands must be provided at the same rate to generate smooth actuator trajectories. On the other hand, standard computers need more time to solve refined NSs and to integrate the equation of motion. Parallel partitioned time integration algorithms, which allow for the concurrent solution of involved subdomains with different time steps, are recognized as a very effective synchronization strategy. With the objective in mind to overcome major limitations of state-of-art algorithms, an improved parallel partitioned time integration scheme was tailored to first order systems. In detail, a variant of the Generalized-α method was <b>selected</b> as <b>basic</b> monolithic <b>time</b> integrator, for its favorable user controlled algorithmic damping feature. Accuracy, stability and spectral characteristics of the resulting algorithm were derived from numerical simulations of benchmark split-mass systems. Therefore, a Simulink implementation of the proposed method was devised for the xPC-Target real-time operating system for the purpose of its experimental validation. Particular care was devoted to parallelization aspects. Tests conducted on a 4 -DoFs split-mass system corroborated the favourable characteristics of the proposed method from the HSDS perspective.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{probabilistic}} failure {{analysis of a}} fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) sandwich plate subjected to a lateral pressure load. Input parameters {{to the strength of}} the sandwich plate such as a lateral pressure load, elastic moduli and the geometric and ultimate strength values, are treated as basic design variables, and a specific probability distribution is applied to them to take into account their variability. Based on the <b>selected</b> <b>basic</b> design variables, simplified higher-order shear deformation theory (HSDT) is used to calculate the probabilistic structural response of the sandwich plate. The limit state equations are derived from polynomial failure criteria such as maximum stress, maximum strain, Tsai-Hill, Tsai-Wu and Hoffman criteria. The calculated probabilistic structural response of the sandwich plate and the basic design variables of the ultimate strength are then substituted into the derived limit state equations to define the failure or survival state of the sandwich plate. Results are interpreted in three categories such as probabilistic failures at the faces and the core, probabilistic strength distributions of the sandwich plate and sensitivity of each <b>selected</b> <b>basic</b> design variable to estimated probabilistic sandwich plate strength...|$|R

This is because, the prosperity and economic {{well being of}} any country have direct link with technological knowhow of such a country. Hence, adequate and in-depth knowledge of basic engineering courses are required to become a successful engineer. This study was carried out to determine, if {{there were significant differences}} in the performance of male and female students in <b>selected</b> <b>basic</b> engineering courses at Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso. Secondary data in form of the results or scores {{for the past five years}} were collected from the examination officers of various departments, through the permission of their heads of departments. Essentially, cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of the students was used. Data were analysed using means and standard deviations at 95 % confidence level. Data were further subjected to Anova-tests. The trends of performance of students based on gender, courses, and as well as years of study were also investigated. The mean scores of 1. 575, 2. 40, 1. 85, 2. 875, 3. 175 and 2. 65 were obtained for female students for the period of five years in the six selected courses in the harmattan semester, while the corresponding mean scores for male students were 1. 725, 1. 725, 2. 35, 3. 40, 3. 55 and 3. 125. In the rain semester, the mean scores of 2. 00, 3. 20, 2. 375, 2. 775, 1, 775 and 2. 675 were obtained for female students, while mean scores of 2. 45, 3. 625, 3. 375, 3. 125, 2. 65 and 3. 525 were obtained for male students. Statistics revealed that, there was significant difference in the overall performance between the male and female students in the six <b>selected</b> <b>basic</b> engineering courses in both harmattan and rain semesters.
