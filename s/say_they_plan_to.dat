40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of how {{established}} institutions within the media and telecom industries act in times of change, using {{the first decade of}} the 2000 s as its time frame. As an emerging field that has inspired high expectations but also much uncertainty, mobile media has been a leading subject of scholarly investigation. Located mainly within the management of technological innovation tradition, this thesis discusses how incumbent institutions, with their legacies from the traditional media and telecom industries, make sense of the mobile device as a media platform, as well as how they translate their perceptions into plans and actions. Furthermore, this thesis connects the development of mobile media to other, more far-reaching developments—technological, cultural and economic—within the media and telecom industries. Hence it considers how mobile-media perceptions and facilitations are related to the more general developments of media convergence, changing audience relations and challenging new-media business models. It concentrates on well-established institutions from the Norwegian media and telecom markets—the incumbent telecom operator Telenor, the public service broadcaster NRK, the tabloid newspaper VG, the commercial television channel TV 2 and the commercial radio channel P 4 in particular. This thesis relies upon a multifold definition of the term “strategy” and distinguishes further among strategies as plans, patterns and perspectives. Hence, it analyses not only what these institutions <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> do (and what they actually do) regarding mobile media but also the foundation of these decisions—that is, industry perceptions and working notions. The latter term is given particular attention in this thesis, because analyses of strategies as plans or patterns can mislead us into believing that the institution’s decision-making processes are linear and rational and driven by well-documented goals and aims. On the other hand, studies that incorporate working notions - where different working notions compete and where the dominant working notion might even change over time - provide a more chaotic but ultimately more dynamic and realistic representation of reality. This thesis aims to substantiate why, and outline how, this is so...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Washington State UniversityThis {{dissertation}} {{includes two}} studies: {{a pilot study}} on native-English-speaking preservice teachers' perceptions of learning a foreign language online and a follow-up study on inservice teachers' perceptions of transferring teacher linguistic, cultural and technological awareness into teaching practice. Conducted in 2010, the pilot study included 35 teacher education students, all of whom took a nine-week Chinese language/culture online course. Data sources included paper-based pre-and-post assessment, online pre-and-post assessment, task products, email correspondence, class discussion and class feedback. The pilot study was intended to explore four research questions: 1. What are the preservice teachers' initial perceptions of a Chinese as a foreign language online course? 2. How do preservice teachers' perceptions of new language online learning experience change as they take the course? 3. What activities do learners perceive as engaging them in the online course? 4. How do preservice teachers <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> apply their experience/benefits of the course to their own future classrooms before, {{during and after the}} course? The results of the pilot study suggested that 1) new forms of online learning were engaging to teacher-learners with diverse learning styles, prior technological experience, needs and goals; 2) the preservice teachers perceived that online foreign language learning during their teacher education program enhanced their linguistic, cultural and technological awareness; and 3) the participants expressed that they benefited from being prepared to work with linguistic, cultural, and technological diversity in classrooms. However, the pilot study was unclear about whether teachers perceived they transfer their awareness into teaching practice. Therefore, extending the pilot study, the follow-up study conducted in 2012 explored inservice teachers' perceptions of linguistic, cultural and technological awareness transfer. The pilot study suggested three main research questions: 1. What do teachers remember about linguistic, cultural and technological awareness acquired through the foreign language online course taken during their teacher education program? 2. Do teachers perceive that they apply what they learned? In what ways? 3. What challenges do teachers perceive that they encounter in transferring what they learned into their teaching, and how do they overcome the challenges?Language and Literacy Education, Washington State Universit...|$|E
40|$|Last March, Tom Wiener’s {{physicians}} {{noticed a}} small lump {{on the side}} of his neck. Tom dutifully followed through with a CT scan at his community hospital. While the scan confirmed that the lump in his neck was nothing to worry about, it also revealed something more suspicious in the upper part of his right lung. As Tom recalls, the physicians said it could be one of two things – a tumor or an infection. After two follow-up tests, Tom and his wife, Felice, received the frightening diagnosis: lung cancer. Referred to Jefferson, Tom soon met Scott W. Cowan, MD, FACS, at Methodist Hospital. Dr. Cowan told him that many of his patients undergo operations on “incidental findings” like his. In early May, Dr. Cowan performed a minimally invasive lobectomy to remove the tumor from Tom’s lung – and he made a full recovery without the need for radiation or chemotherapy. “Fortunately, it turned out to have been a slow-growing adenocarcinoma. It was the size of a golf ball and totally self-contained,” says Tom, who lives in Wynnewood and practices law in Bala Cynwyd, PA. In reflecting on his experiences as a patient, Tom lauds Dr. Cowan both for his surgical prowess and his warm personality. “Scott and the entire Jefferson team took great care of me,” Tom says. “I’m very grateful; they did a wonderful job. ” When presented with the opportunity to make a contribution to the Department of Surgery, Tom and Felice were happy to support Dr. Cowan’s efforts as Jefferson’s NSQIP (National Surgical Quality Improvement Program) Surgeon Champion. The Wieners’ generous gift is helping to offset the cost of Dr. Adam Johnson’s two-year Quality and Safety Fellowship – the first of its kind at Jefferson (see cover story). Both <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> continue contributing as long as they are able. Felice is thankful to Dr. Cowan “because he did such a good job with my sweet husband” – and she says she already had good memories of Jefferson, having given birth to one of the couple’s four children at Jefferson some 40 years ago. These days, the Wieners are enjoying good health and an extra special “gift” from their daughter: their third grandchild (and the first to live nearby).

40|$|The {{public sector}} {{collects}} and generates {{vast amounts of}} data. In recent years the interest in re-using public, non-personal data has been increasing among citizens, groups and companies outside the public sector. The media, civil society groups, businesses and private citizens can use public data as "raw material" to create new services, new insight and economic value. Efficient re-use of public data requires that public sector agencies inform about their data sources and make data available in relevant formats. Practice varies strongly between Norwegian public sector agencies in different subject areas and across administrative levels (state/regional/local), this fact finding project from August to December 2009 has revealed. Some agencies offer detailed information about their data sources and have made data available for download. However, {{a major part of}} the agencies assessed offer insufficient or no information about data sources on the homepage of their websites. Here a fundamental requirement for the re-use of data is missing. The impression of varying interest and unused potential is amplified by the results of a survey among state agencies. Two thirds of respondents say their agency possesses data with potential for re-use that is not utilized today. The survey on the other hand suggests that the subject of open data is on the agenda in many agencies; more than six out of ten <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> make more data available for re-use during the coming year. The survey shows that increased costs and the concern that external groups will misunderstand the data and misinform the public are cited as the two greatest obstacles against more data being made available. In addition, interviews with public sector agency employees suggest that the topic of making data available is new to some agencies. A comparison with initiatives and debates about open public data in a selection of other countries (Britain, Denmark, Netherlands, USA) show that the attention the topic receives is greatest when it is placed on the agenda at the highest political level. The report recommends a number of concrete measures that it is assumed would quickly increase the selection of data sets made available for re-use. A website that collects public data sources, inspired by the US government's data. gov, would be an obviously efficient initiative, especially when accompanied by a set of clear principles and rules and an "instruction manual" that describes how to make data available in a secure and user-friendly way. The report also points out the need for a parallel, ongoing debate about criteria for the constructive re-use of data. The media should, in cooperation with the public, play a leading role by producing examples of best practices in re-using open data...|$|E
40|$|Nebraska’s {{economy has}} {{continued}} to struggle during the past year. In addition, many rural communities are experiencing population decline. How have these changes affected rural Nebraskans? How do rural Nebraskans perceive their quality of life? Do their perceptions differ by community size, the region in which they live, or their occupation? How do they feel about their community? Are they planning to move from their community in the next year? This report details 3, 087 responses to the 2003 Nebraska Rural Poll, the eighth annual effort to understand rural Nebraskans’ perceptions. Respondents were asked {{a series of questions}} regarding their individual well-being as well as their community. Trends for these questions are examined by comparing data from the seven previous polls to this year’s results. For all questions, comparisons are made among different respondent subgroups, i. e., comparisons by age, occupation, region, etc. Based on these analyses, some key findings emerged: •	 Rural Nebraskans are more negative about their current situation than they were last year. This year, only 27 percent believe they are better off then they were five years ago, compared to 37 percent in 2002. Also, the percent saying they are worse off then they were five years ago increased from 21 percent to 30 percent. The proportion saying they remained about the same was unchanged at 43 percent. •	 When looking to the future, rural Nebraskans are not as positive as they were last year. The proportion believing they will be better off ten years from now decreased from 36 percent to 31 percent. Conversely, the proportion that think they will be worse off increased from 18 percent to 26 percent. The percent saying they will be about the same decreased from 46 percent to 43 percent. •	Rural Nebraskans are slightly more likely to feel powerless as compared to last year. This year, 33 percent strongly agree or agree with the statement that people are powerless to control their lives. Last year, 30 percent agreed with the statement. •	 Farmers and ranchers are less optimistic about their current situation than persons with different occupations. Only 19 percent of the farmers and ranchers think they are better off compared to five years ago. In comparison, 44 percent of the persons with professional occupations say they are better off. •	Persons with lower educational levels are more likely than persons with more education to believe that people are powerless to control their own lives. Fifty-six percent of the persons without a high school diploma agree that people are powerless to control their own lives. However, only 18 percent of the persons with a four-year college degree share this opinion. •	Rural Nebraskans report being most satisfied with their family, their religion/spirituality and friends. They are most dissatisfied with their financial security during retirement, their current income level and their job opportunities. •	Farmers and ranchers are more likely than persons with different occupations to report being dissatisfied with their current income level. Fifty-nine percent of the farmers and ranchers are dissatisfied with their current income level, compared to only 30 percent of the persons with professional occupations. •	 Rural Nebraskans are slightly more negative about the change in their communities than last year. This year, only 22 percent believe their community has changed for the better, compared to 24 percent last year. And, in 2003, 25 percent think their community has changed for the worse, compared to only 22 percent last year. •	Rural Nebraskans living in or near the largest communities are more likely than the persons living in or near the smaller communities to say their community has changed for the better. Twenty-eight percent of the persons living in or near communities with populations of 10, 000 or more say their community has changed for the better. Only 12 percent of the persons living in or near communities with less than 500 people share this opinion. •	 The community services and amenities that rural Nebraskans are most dissatisfied with include: entertainment, retail shopping and restaurants. They are most satisfied with parks and recreation, library services, basic medical care services, education (K - 12), and highways and bridges. •	Smaller community residents are more likely than residents of larger communities to be dissatisfied with their law enforcement. Thirty-six percent of the residents living in or near communities with less than 500 people express dissatisfaction with their community’s law enforcement. Only 20 percent of the persons living in or near communities with populations of 5, 000 or more are dissatisfied with their law enforcement. •	 Rural Nebraskans who are divorced or separated are more likely than other marital groups to report dissatisfaction with their community’s housing. Thirty-four percent of these respondents are dissatisfied with the housing in their community, compared to only 14 percent of the widowed respondents. •	 Younger persons are more likely than older persons to be planning to move from their community next year. Eighteen percent of the persons between the ages of 19 and 29 are planning to move next year, compared to only two percent of the persons age 65 and older. An additional 15 percent of the younger persons are uncertain if they plan to move. •	 The expected movers from the Panhandle are more likely than the expected movers from other regions to plan to leave the state. Seventy-seven percent of the Panhandle residents who are planning to move from their community next year <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> move some place other than Nebraska. Only 36 percent of the expected movers in both the South Central and Northeast regions plan on leaving the state...|$|E

Studies show that a relatively small and decreasing number of journalists <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> retire in the field (Becker, et al., 2001; Voakes, 1997; Weaver and Wilhoit, 1996). The percent of journalists <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> leave the field nearly doubled from 1971 to 1982, and then nearly doubled again in 1992, as over one-fifth of journalists reported they were likely to change careers (Weaver and Wilhoit, 1996).

40|$|Background Electronic {{nicotine}} {{delivery systems}} (ENDS), {{also referred to}} as electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes, were introduced into the US market in 2007. Despite concerns regarding the long-term health impact of this product, there is little known about awareness and use of ENDS among adults in the USA. Methods A consumer-based mail-in survey (ConsumerStyles) was completed by 10 587 adults ($ 18 years) in 2009 and 10 328 adults in 2010. Data from these surveys were used to monitor awareness, ever use and past month use of ENDS from 2009 to 2010 and to assess demographic characteristics and tobacco use of ENDS users. Results In this US sample, awareness of ENDS doubled from 16. 4 % in 2009 to 32. 2 % in 2010 and ever use more than quadrupled from 2009 (0. 6 %) to 2010 (2. 7 %). Ever use of ENDS was most common among women and those with lower education, although these were not the groups who had heard of ENDS most often. Current smokers and tobacco users were most likely to try ENDS. However, current smokers who had tried ENDS did not <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> quit smoking more often than smokers who had never tried them. Conclusions Given the large increase in awareness and ever use of ENDS during this 1 -year period and the unknown impact of ENDS use on cigarette smoking behaviours and long-term health, continued monitoring of these products is needed...|$|R
5000|$|As much as {{the recent}} {{improvements}} are commendable, the country faces important challenges going forward. Education in Saudi Arabia {{does not meet the}} standards of countries at similar income levels. While some progress is visible in the assessment of the quality of education, improvements are taking place from a low level. As a result, the country continues to occupy low ranks in the health and primary education (74th) and higher education and training (51st). [...] The youth consists of more than 70% of the country’s population and many of young Saudis are looking to entrepreneurship as a career path. According to the latest survey conducted by Gallup between July to October 2009, among the high-income group in the region, 78% of the Saudi youth believed that their local communities are good places for such entrepreneurs and 30% of young Saudis who are not already business owners <b>say</b> <b>they</b> are <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> start their own business in the next 12 months. Youth in Saudi Arabia are three times as likely <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> are <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> launch a business if they perceive the government makes paperwork and permits easy enough for aspiring entrepreneurs. If out of work for more than six months, 51% of youth indicate {{they would be willing to}} take a job beneath their skills or train in a new field or start their own business. Among youth who express entrepreneurship aspirations, 61% are employed. Saudi youth reported dissatisfaction with efforts to increase the number of quality jobs within the Kingdom. However, 93% of young Saudis say taking part in regular job training increases their chances of getting a job.|$|R
5000|$|Discussions {{with the}} {{neighborhood}} and community leaders during this unrest had been unproductive with the Lees' attorney advising them <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> were <b>planning</b> <b>to</b> leave to quell the unrest. The Lees {{were members of the}} local NAACP chapter and reached out to them for assistance. Lena O. Smith, the chapter's president, offered legal assistance and argued the Lees should remain as a statement {{that they would not be}} intimidated. The Lees accepted Smith's counsel and she drafted a statement published in all of the local newspapers noting that [...] "Lee has no intentionof moving now or later, even after we are assured the feeling in the district has subsided." [...] Smith's assertive public statement combined with the strong police presence quelled the rioting.|$|R

2500|$|It is {{traditionally}} considered to commence {{on the day}} after American Thanksgiving, a Friday colloquially known as either Black Friday or Green Friday. This is widely reputed to be the busiest shopping day of the entire calendar year. However, in 2004 the VISA credit card organization reported that over the previous several years VISA credit card spending had in fact been 8 to 19 percent higher on the last Saturday before Christmas Day (i.e., Super Saturday) than on Black Friday. A survey conducted in 2005 by GfK NOP discovered that [...] "Americans aren't as drawn to Black Friday as many retailers may think.", with only 17% of those polled <b>saying</b> that <b>they</b> will begin holiday shopping immediately after Thanksgiving, 13% <b>saying</b> that <b>they</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> finish their shopping before November 24 and 10% waiting until the very last day before performing their holiday gift shopping.|$|R
