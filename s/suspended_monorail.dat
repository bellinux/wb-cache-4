2500|$|Proposal of <b>suspended</b> <b>monorail</b> {{mass transit}} system for Denver 1948 ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1966 a {{proposal}} was explored {{to construct an}} above-ground <b>suspended</b> <b>monorail</b> across central Manchester. The £21m plan involved {{the construction of a}} [...] line from Ringway Airport, running north through Wythenshawe, Didsbury and Moss side to Central Station, crossing the city centre via an underground tunnel via Ancoats to Victoria, and then onwards through Collyhurst and Alkrington to Middleton. Supported by the Ministry of Transport, Manchester Corporation analysed the possibility of investing in the SAFEGE monorail system which had been developed in France, and the possibility of running monorail trains suspended from tracks along the centre of existing roads, above vehicular traffic.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Fawkes {{called the}} trolley his Aerial Swallow, a cigar-shaped, <b>suspended</b> <b>monorail</b> {{driven by a}} {{propeller}} that he promised would carry passengers from Burbank to downtown Los Angeles in 10minutes. The first open car accommodated about 20 passengers and was suspended from an overhead track and supported by wooden beams. In 1911, the monorail car made its first and only run through his Burbank ranch, with a line between Lake and Flower Streets. The monorail was considered a failure after gliding just {{a foot or so}} and falling to pieces. Nobody was injured but Joseph Fawkes' pride was badly hurt as Aerial Swallow became known as [...] "Fawkes' Folly." [...] City officials viewed his test run as a failure and focused on getting a Pacific Electric Streetcar line into Burbank.|$|E

50|$|Modern monorails {{depend on}} a large solid beam as the vehicles' running surface. There {{are a number of}} {{competing}} designs divided into two broad classes, straddle-beam and <b>suspended</b> <b>monorails.</b>|$|R
50|$|Current monorails {{are capable}} of more {{efficient}} switching than in the past. With <b>suspended</b> <b>monorails,</b> switching may be accomplished by moving flanges inside the beamway to shift trains to one line or another.|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{previous}} <b>suspended</b> <b>monorails</b> {{like the}} Schwebebahn in Wuppertal, Germany, the tracks are {{not exposed to}} inclement weather, and do not need any cleaning or ice-removal systems. This advantage enables them to run in cities where ice and other conditions would impair {{the reliability of the}} system.|$|R
50|$|Most of today's Stadtbahn {{lines were}} {{developed}} out of former tram lines. Their line numbers were simply converted into two-digit numbers prepended by U for distinguishing between both standards; the U refers to both unabhängig (engl.: independent) and U-Bahn (metro) standards being the later target, although complete U-Bahn (metro) lines {{have in fact}} never existed in the Rhine-Ruhr area. By 2011, the only full independent lines in the Rhine-Ruhr area are the Dortmund H-Bahn, Düsseldorf SkyTrain and Wuppertal Schwebebahn (also referred as line 60 in the Stadtbahn numbering scheme) hanging and <b>suspended</b> <b>monorails.</b>|$|R
30|$|Monorail is a {{moderate}} volume rail transit system with electric vehicles {{running on a}} track beam. According to the positional relationship between the vehicle and the track beam, it {{can be divided into}} two types of monorail such as straddle <b>monorail</b> and <b>suspend</b> type <b>monorail.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Shonan Monorail (Shōnan Monorēru) is a <b>suspended</b> SAFEGE <b>monorail</b> in {{the cities}} of Kamakura and Fujisawa in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. It is {{operated}} by the Shonan Monorail Co., Ltd (Shōnan Monorēru Kabushiki-gaisha), and opened on March 7, 1970, the first monorail {{of its kind in}} Japan.|$|R
5000|$|During the pre-Christmas {{shopping}} period, Herpolsheimer's {{operated the}} [...] "Santa Express" [...] miniature train on a <b>monorail</b> <b>suspended</b> {{from the ceiling}} of the basement in its downtown Grand Rapids store. The train is now located at the Grand Rapids Public Museum.|$|R
5000|$|The {{proposed}} Shweeb {{transit network}} relies on recumbent bicycle technology to power pods <b>suspended</b> from <b>monorails.</b> According to Shweeb Monorail Technology, {{the intent of}} their proposal is to [...] "create a solution which provided the user with the same flexibility and comfort offered by the car but without the consequential costs - both direct financial and indirect health and environmental costs." [...] The proposal envisions networks of monorail track providing point to point and commuter transit for urban areas.|$|R
50|$|It is {{the longest}} <b>suspended</b> <b>monorail</b> system at 15.2 km in track length.|$|E
50|$|In 1886, the Enos Electric Company {{demonstrated}} a <b>suspended</b> <b>monorail</b> {{on the grounds}} of the Daft Electric Light Company in the Greenville section of Jersey City, New Jersey, which was closer in its appearance to more modern monorails, but the most famous <b>suspended</b> <b>monorail</b> of this era was Eugen Langen's 'Schwebebahn', or floating railway, of Wuppertal, which entered service in 1901, and is still in daily use.|$|E

5000|$|MonoMetro is a {{transportation}} planning company formed in 1997 {{to promote a}} new design of <b>suspended</b> narrow-gauge <b>monorails,</b> with Y-shaped pillars. Its main activity has been to promote this as an answer to London's congestion problems, but interest {{has also been shown}} in the system by other cities. MonoMetro claims its system would be cheaper to introduce than a tram as it would not be necessary to divert or strengthen sewers along its route and that it is also superior to monorail systems.|$|R
50|$|For the new store (as {{with the}} Glaspaleis) {{inspiration}} was sought throughout Europe, including {{visits to the}} US and Sweden (especially the redevelopment of the Stockholm city centre {{and its effect on}} shopping was a good example because it was better adapted to the European situation). The new store wasn't just much bigger, but featured an extended assortment, a selection one would expect of a modern warehouse store. Clothing, Schunck's mainstay, was still dominant on floors 1 (children), 2 (ladies) and 3 (gents) (with 47 fitting rooms). In the Glaspaleis, customers were welcome to {{have a cup of coffee}} at the penthouse (serviced by the family themselves), but now this was professionalised to a complete lunchroom for 180 people at the fourth floor. The other half of that floor featured toys and interior furnishings, also something that was already present at the Glaspaleis. Offices and the canteen were on the top floor. The new sections, however, were located at the two lowest floors. The ground floor featured merchandise like stationery (and many pocket books), perfume and suitcases and a patisserie with its own bakery (all self-service, except for the bonbons, which had to be weighed). The souterrain housed a 2600 m² supermarket, with 7000 items on sale and an assortment ranging from Russian caviar to 70 types of cheese. Extra efficiency was achieved at the seven checkout counters by using two trolleys (and no conveyor belt). A cashier would move the items from one trolley to the other and the customer could then take that to one of the 53 'packaging tables' (with assistance for those who desired it), thus reducing waiting time at the counter. The region is known for its high demand for quality meat. The butchery in the supermarket had a total counter length of 45 m, and a freezer with a capacity of 10.000 kg of meat. This and the other cooled storage rooms (e.g., for fruit and dairy products) were serviced by a <b>monorail,</b> <b>suspended</b> from the ceiling. This, combined with automated weighing and packaging machines (with a capacity of 10,000 packages of meat per day and shrink-wrap for fruit) meant that the food did not need to be touched by human hands, which had its advantages for hygiene. Nevertheless, there were constantly 7 butchers at work.|$|R

50|$|The railway {{is one of}} two {{funicular}} railways in Dresden, {{the other}} being the unusual Schwebebahn Dresden, a <b>suspended</b> <b>monorail.</b> Both lines are operated by the Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe AG, who also operate the city's tram, bus and ferry networks.|$|E
50|$|The Ueno Zoo Monorail is a 0.3 km long <b>suspended</b> <b>monorail</b> {{operated}} by the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation (Toei). It {{is similar to the}} Schwebebahn Wuppertal, but has rubber tires rather than steel wheels. The line began operating on December 17, 1958.|$|E
