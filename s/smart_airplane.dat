40|$|Abstract Air travel {{has become}} the {{preferred}} mode of long-distance transportation {{for most of the}} worldâ€™s trav-elers. People of every age group and health status are traveling by airplane and thus the airplane has become part of our environment, in which people with health-related limitations need assistive support. Since the main interac-tion point between a passenger and the airplane is the seat, this work presents a <b>smart</b> <b>airplane</b> seat for measuring health-related signals of a passenger. We describe the design, implementation and testing of a multimodal sensor system integrated into the seat. The presented system is able to measure physiological signals, such as electrocar-diogram, electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and respiration. We show how the design of the smart seat system is influenced by the trade-off between comfort and signal quality, i. e. incorporating unobtrusive sensors and dealing with erroneous signals. Artifact detection through sensor fusion is presented and the working principle is shown with a feasibility study, in which normal passenger activities were performed. Based on the presented method, we are able to identify signal regions in which the accu-racies for detecting the heart- and respiration-rate are 88 and 82 %, respectively, compared to 40 and 76 % without any artifact removal...|$|E
5000|$|A {{computer}} scientist accidentally unleashes a supremely intelligent sentient A.I. named Archos R-14. It becomes self-aware and immediately starts planning {{the elimination of}} human civilization and building a new cryptic ecology, where the organic is being merged with robot technology. Over time, Archos R-14 infects all penetrable networked electronic devices, such as cars, <b>airplanes,</b> <b>smart</b> homes, elevators, and other robots, with a [...] "precursor virus".|$|R
