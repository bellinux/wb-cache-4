George worries that his girlfriend is going to leave him because of it.|$|E
5|$|Little is {{revealed}} of Quatermass's early life {{during the course}} of the films and television series in which he appears. In The Quatermass Experiment, he at one point despairs that he should have <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> original career as a surveyor.|$|E
5|$|Difficult {{economic}} times marked Brown's term in office. During his tenure, the state's unemployment rate climbed from 5.6 percent to 11.7 percent. Brown <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> campaign {{promise not to}} raise taxes. When state income fell short of expectations, he reduced the state budget by 22 percent and {{cut the number of}} state employees from 37,241 to 30,783, mostly through transfer and attrition. At the same time, his merit pay policies increased salaries for the remaining employees by an average of 34 percent. He cut the executive office staff from ninety-seven to thirty, and sold seven of the state's eight government airplanes.|$|E
60|$|Ginger was {{surprised}} at the way 'e was getting on, and so was old Sam and Peter Russet, and when Ginger knocked Bill down in the sixth round Sam went as pale as death. Ginger was getting marked all over, but he <b>stuck,</b> <b>to</b> <b>'is</b> man, and the two dock policemen, wot 'ad put their money on Bill Lumm, began to talk of their dooty, and say as 'ow the fight ought to be stopped.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray, don't wish now; for it {{may come}} to pass as the man's wish in the fairy tale did, and the black pudding flew up and <b>stuck</b> tight <b>to</b> <b>his</b> wife's nose." ...|$|R

5|$|Because Ratatouille is {{intended}} to be a romantic, lush vision of Paris, giving it an identity distinct from previous Pixar films, director Brad Bird, producer Brad Lewis and some of the crew spent a week in the city to properly understand its environment, taking a motorcycle tour and eating at five top restaurants. There are also many water-based sequences in the film, one of which is set in the sewers and is more complex than the blue whale scene in Finding Nemo. One scene has Linguini wet after jumping into the Seine to fetch Remy. A Pixar employee (Shade/Paint department coordinator Kesten Migdal) jumped into Pixar's swimming pool wearing a chef's uniform and apron to see which parts of the suit <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> body and which became translucent from water absorption.|$|E
5|$|Warren Davis, a {{programmer}} hired {{to work on}} the action game Protector, noticed Lee's ideas, and asked if he could use them to practice programming randomness and gravity as game mechanic. Thus, he added balls that bounced from the pyramid's top to bottom. Because Davis was still learning how to program game mechanics, he wanted to keep the design simple. He also felt games with complex control schemes were frustrating and wanted something that could be played with one hand. To accomplish this, Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective to saving the protagonist from danger. As Davis worked on the game one night, Gottlieb's vice president of engineering, Ron Waxman, noticed him and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game's character has landed on them. Davis implemented a unique control scheme; a four-way joystick was rotated 45° to match the directions of Q*bert's jumping. Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation, but Davis <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> decision. Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982, but the project was only put on schedule as an actual product several months later.|$|E
25|$|Fabius had {{the full}} might of the Roman state behind him while Hannibal {{was cut off}} from reinforcements. With Roman patrols harassing Carthaginian foragers, Hannibal's {{soldiers}} suffered {{a steady stream of}} casualties. Fabius thus again played to his strength, as he could make good his losses while Hannibal could not, being adrift in hostile country. The confidence and skill of the Roman soldiers increased as Fabius <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> methods.|$|E
60|$|Lieutenant Manley, the Brigade Commissariat Officer, <b>stuck</b> stubbornly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> post, {{and with}} Sergeant Harrington endeavoured {{to hold the}} hut in which he lived. The savage tribesmen burst {{in the door and}} crowded into the room. What {{followed}} reads like a romance.|$|R
6000|$|Uncle Mac {{had brought}} Fun See to dinner, {{and it was}} a mercy he did, for the elder lads found a vent for their merriment in joking the young Chinaman on his {{improved}} appearance. He was in American costume now, with a cropped head, and spoke remarkably good English after six months at school; but, for all that, his yellow face and beady eyes made a curious contrast to the blonde Campbells all about him. Will called him the [...] "Typhoon," [...] meaning Tycoon, and the name <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> him <b>to</b> <b>his</b> great disgust.|$|R
6000|$|Then, however, she paused. I daresay she {{had been}} going to observe {{that if he were}} {{changeable}} he would long ago have given her up. After an instant she went on: [...] "He wouldn't have <b>stuck</b> so <b>to</b> <b>his</b> profession. You can't make much by it." ...|$|R
25|$|On {{his return}} Robertson wrote Haig an equivocal letter (27 September) stating that he <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> advice to {{concentrate}} {{effort on the}} Western Front rather than Palestine out of instinct and lack of any alternative than from any convincing argument. He also wrote that “Germany may be much nearer {{the end of her}} staying power than available evidence shows” but that given French and Italian weakness it was “not an easy business to see through the problem”.|$|E
25|$|Day three {{began with}} a dejected England looking as though {{they knew they had}} no hope of extracting a victory from the test, and also knowing they would have to bat out at least two days to salvage a draw. But that was yet to come, as Border and Healy resumed Australia's mammoth total. England got the early {{breakthrough}} though, dismissing Healy, clean bowled by Fraser, second ball of the day without adding to the overnight total. Off-spinner Trevor Hohns joined captain Border, and the pair batted through the morning taking Australia past 600. Border unselfishly <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> declaration target of 600, even though it left his 35 shy of a century on 65, and declared Australia's innings closed shortly before lunch on 602 for 6, the second time in the series Australia had passed 600.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only were}} the peace terms {{probably}} offered by the Frisians to the Danes, but the Frisians were very submissive in the deal. Though under the treaty the Danes are not {{to complain about the}} death of Hnæf, Finn more extremely swears that any Frisian who provokes further violence would be, {{in the language of the}} poet, settled with the edge of the sword. The defenders are also to be given half of a new building, which, confusingly they are to share with Finn and the eotena sons (see below), and also to be given feasts and treasure by Finn. The concessions by Finn may reflect his remorse at the events, or it may have been seen as a suitable weregild for the defenders not avenging the killing of Hnæf. The Beowulf poet describes how Finn <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> oath by giving treasure.|$|E
60|$|As the negro's {{account of}} this inflecting and parting was {{substantially}} correct, we feel indisposed to add more to it, {{except to say that}} our hero <b>stuck</b> manfully <b>to</b> <b>his</b> resolve, and finally went off to the distant valley in the Andes without again meeting the Inca princess.|$|R
6000|$|Notwithstanding this declaration, the {{troubles}} at Garpsdal were attributed by others to Magnus, {{and the name}} of the [...] "Garpsdale Ghost" [...] <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> him throughout <b>his</b> life. He was alive in 1862, when Jon Arnason's volume was published.|$|R
5000|$|Kelly started busking. On a {{trip home}} {{he went to}} a fleadh cheoil in Milltown Malbay on the advice of Johnny Moynihan. He listened to {{recordings}} of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger. He also developed his political convictions which, as Ronnie Drew pointed out after <b>his</b> death, he <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> throughout <b>his</b> life. As Drew also pointed out, he [...] "learned to sing with perfect diction".|$|R
25|$|The rise of state-subsidised theatre, and the {{emergence}} of kitchen sink drama undermined Beaumont's pre-eminence beginning in the 1950s. He disapproved of both, and <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> style of lavish, starry West End productions, even when they began to go out of fashion. He alienated both Coward and Terence Rattigan with his arrogant and sometimes duplicitous behaviour. Beaumont attempted to sabotage the former's new play Waiting in the Wings by telling him that the actresses Coward wanted to cast refused to play in it, whereas in reality Beaumont had not consulted them. He continued to have enormous successes: in 1958, he presented the first British productions of both West Side Story (1040 performances) and My Fair Lady (2281 performances). The latter cost an unprecedented sum to stage, but, thanks to a sustained publicity campaign by Tennent's, advance bookings meant that the show was in net profit two months before it opened.|$|E
500|$|Gannon led County to an {{impressive}} {{start to the}} season following their promotion, and they spent Christmas in the play-off places with the best away record in the division. [...] The new year started uncomfortably for Gannon; with media speculation linking him with a move away from Edgeley Park, and the club announcing they were in financial difficulty, he took interviews reassuring fans of his intent to stick by County. Gannon <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> one-year rolling deal after rejecting new contract offers from the club.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{their initial}} misgivings, the Wehrmacht {{established}} a good {{working relationship with}} Meyszner during 1942. Bader and Meyszner met regularly and supported each other where their interests coincided. By contrast, the conflict between Meyszner and Turner soon became intractable– they sent long letters of complaint to each other which they copied to Himmler. Himmler <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> general approach, which was that SS officers should resolve their differences face-to-face. Meyszner fundamentally opposed any attempts by Turner to expand the remit of the Serbian puppet regime, including the creation of sporting organisations and the re-opening of the University of Belgrade, asserting {{that it could not}} be in Germany's interests to [...] "breed hostile Slavic intelligence".|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{he is not}} {{changeable}}. If he were changeable----' But here my interlocutress paused. I suspect she {{had been}} {{going to say that}} if he were changeable he would have given her up long ago. After an instant she went on: 'He wouldn't have <b>stuck</b> so <b>to</b> <b>his</b> profession. You can't make much by it.' ...|$|R
60|$|Next morning Abercrombie Smith {{heard nothing}} of his neighbour, but Harrington called upon {{him in the}} {{afternoon}} to say that Lee was almost himself again. All day Smith <b>stuck</b> fast <b>to</b> <b>his</b> work, but in the evening he determined to pay the visit <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friend Doctor Peterson upon which he had started the night before. A good walk and a friendly chat would be welcome <b>to</b> <b>his</b> jangled nerves.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the defeat}} and humiliation of World War I weighed heavily on him … {{and he found}} the 1920s a {{difficult}} time to earn a living. His natural curiosity faded, and he failed {{to keep pace with}} the innovations of younger rose breeders … he <b>stuck</b> increasingly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own breeding lines and seldom took in new genes from other breeders' breakthroughs.|$|R
500|$|Three {{tracks that}} each clock at over six minutes {{make up the}} second half. [...] Each is in a plodding Black Sabbath-esque sludge metal style with {{ponderous}} lyrics of unrelenting self-hate. [...] On [...] "Three Nights" [...] Rollins compares himself to feces <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> shoe: [...] "And I've been grinding that stink into the dirt/ For a long time now". [...] Against a slow, heavy, start-and-stop bass riff and a constant drum thudding, Rollins closes [...] "Scream" [...] with a bellow after delivering the Ginn-penned lines: [...] "I may be a big baby/ But I'll scream in your ear/ 'Til I find out/ Just what it is I am doing here".|$|E
500|$|Radcliffe is a {{supporter}} of the Labour Party. Until 2012, Radcliffe had publicly supported the Liberal Democrats, and before the 2010 general election Radcliffe endorsed Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader. In 2012, however, Radcliffe switched his allegiance to the Labour Party, citing disappointment with the performance of Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats in government, and approving of the Labour leader, Ed Miliband. In August 2015, Radcliffe endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He told The Big Issue: [...] "...I feel like this show of sincerity by a man who has been around long enough and <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> beliefs long enough that he knows them and doesn't have to be scripted is what is making people sit up and get excited. It is great." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward, {{a morally}} {{conflicted}} troll enslaved by Muriel, was voiced by Robin Atkin Downes and played by Derek Mears (Jason Voorhees in 2009's Friday the 13th). Mears was using an elaborate animatronic suit that he compared to [...] "kind of like NASCAR where I’m piloting it but I'm {{not doing it}} by myself...I think there’s like five guys controlling the individual parts of the character. There’s one person who does the eye brows, one person does the feet." [...] Janssen, who could not [...] "say enough things about Tommy [...] ", said she was especially impressed at how he <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> specific vision and [...] "fought" [...] hard to hire a number of unknown European actors {{that would otherwise be}} unlikely to appear in a big studio American film, in effect making it a much more international production.|$|E
60|$|It {{was partly}} in {{furtherance}} of this ambitious design that he had requested Mr. Carter not to open the sealed envelope. The draft treaty was Tommy's bait. Every {{now and then he}} was aghast at his own presumption. How dared he think that he had discovered what so many wiser and clever men had overlooked? Nevertheless, he <b>stuck</b> tenaciously <b>to</b> <b>his</b> idea.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{particularly}} gruesome story {{comes from}} the 1972 24-hour touring car race. During one of his pitstops at night, Hans-Joachim <b>Stuck</b> shouted <b>to</b> <b>his</b> co-driver Jochen Mass over the noise that he should [...] "look out for body parts at the Masta Kink". Mass arrived there expecting to see bits of car all over the road but was appalled to discover {{it was in fact}} the remains of a marshal.|$|R
50|$|Lynch's {{trial began}} in Berrima {{courthouse}} on 21 March 1842 before {{the chief justice}} of New South Wales, Sir James Dowling. Despite the evidence presented to the court, Lynch maintained his plea of innocence, but the jury found him guilty {{in less than an}} hour. He <b>stuck</b> steadfastly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> story of being innocent, as he went through the appeals process, and it was only after this procedure was exhausted that he confessed <b>to</b> <b>his</b> crimes.|$|R
500|$|The legend narrates {{the tale}} behind the {{tradition}} of offering the Ucchishta, which otherwise is a taboo in Hinduism. Once, Shiva {{on a visit to}} Vishnu's abode Vaikuntha, saw that a few food grains (Ucchishta) had fallen on the ground after Vishnu finished his meal. [...] Shiva quickly picked up a grain and swallowed it. Unbeknownst to him, half of it <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> beard. [...] When he returned to his abode, the sage Narada saw the half grain on Shiva's beard, and ate it. [...] Parvati, Shiva's consort, was upset that her rightful share of Vishnu's prasad had been eaten by Narada. In a peeved mood, she went to Vishnu and complained. Vishnu pacified her saying that in the Kali Yuga (the present era as per Hindu beliefs), she would live at Puri as Vimala, and would daily eat the remnants of his food.|$|E
500|$|At about 13:00, Napoleon saw {{the first}} columns of Prussians around the village of Lasne-Chapelle-Saint-Lambert, four or five miles (six to eight kilometres) away from his right flank—about three hours march for an army. Napoleon's {{reaction}} was to have Marshal Soult {{send a message to}} Grouchy telling him to come towards the battlefield and attack the arriving Prussians. Grouchy, however, had been executing Napoleon's previous orders to follow the Prussians [...] "with your sword against his back" [...] towards Wavre, and was by then too far away to reach Waterloo. Grouchy was advised by his subordinate, Gérard, to [...] "march {{to the sound of the}} guns", but <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> orders and engaged the Prussian III Corps rear guard under the command of Lieutenant-General Baron Johann von Thielmann at the Battle of Wavre. Moreover, Soult's letter ordering Grouchy to move quickly to join Napoleon and attack Bülow would not actually reach Grouchy until after 20:00.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the family}} can call it a day, they arrive home and find Amber and Ginger waiting in their driveway. Amber shows Marge and the kids video footage of a drunk Homer marrying Amber in Vegas, while Ginger is next door with the widowed Ned Flanders. Homer tries to get his {{marriage}} to Amber annulled by the court, but Judge Constance Harm refuses, stating that Homer married Amber in Nevada and the marriage still stands, since Homer never officially divorced Amber. Marge is so angry that she banishes Homer, who takes up residence in Bart's treehouse with Amber. Homer still loves Marge and refuses to sleep with Amber, so he tries to sleep in Santa's Little Helper's kennel, but ends up getting its doorway <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head and spends {{the rest of the}} night trying to get it off. The next day, Marge finds Homer asleep amid the broken remains of the doghouse, and she tells Homer that she is still angry at Homer over what he did, but she has a plan to get Amber out of their house.|$|E
6000|$|Occupied thus, Christopher {{was greatly}} {{surprised}} to see, on casually glancing to one side, another man standing {{close to the}} shadowy trunk of another tree, in a similar attitude <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own, gazing, with arms folded, as blankly at {{the windows of the}} house as Christopher himself had been gazing. Not willing to be discovered, Christopher <b>stuck</b> closer <b>to</b> <b>his</b> tree. While he waited thus, the stranger began murmuring words, in a slow soft voice. Christopher listened till he heard the following:-- ...|$|R
60|$|I {{personally}} {{came in for}} a {{good deal}} of quiet esteem for the way in which I <b>stuck</b> <b>to</b> him in <b>his</b> adversity. I don't think Eunice had thought much of me before, but now she seemed to feel that I had formed a corner in golden hearts. I took advantage of this to try and pave the way for a confession on poor old Archie's part.|$|R
5000|$|Askia {{had become}} blind, {{and none of}} the sons were aware of it because Ali Fulan <b>stuck</b> so close <b>to</b> <b>his</b> side (at this time {{blindness}} would have disqualified a ruler as he would have been expected <b>to</b> lead <b>his</b> army into battle, as well as being a bad omen).|$|R
