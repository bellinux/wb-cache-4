5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It {{relies on the}} very high rate of nuclear fission of 242mAm, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of <b>self-absorption</b> of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E
5|$|A 1989 {{document}} generally {{known as}} Aspects of Christian meditation set forth {{the position of}} the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation. The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation {{should not be confused with}} prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a flight from the self, can degenerate into a form of <b>self-absorption.</b>|$|E

In his reactions to flak, and to rape and murder, Aarfy demonstrates complete insanity. Hence he survives and prospers in a completely insane world.|$|E
25|$|To be cool or hip meant hanging out, {{pursuing}} sexual liaisons, {{displaying the}} appropriate attitude of narcissistic <b>self-absorption,</b> and expressing {{a desire to}} escape the mental straitjacket of all ideological causes. From the late 1940s onward, this popular culture influenced young {{people all over the}} world, to the great dismay of the paternalistic elites who still ruled the official culture. The French intelligentsia were outraged, while the British educated classes displayed a haughty indifference that smacked of an older aristocratic cool.|$|E
25|$|Episodes {{revolve around}} the adventures of Sarah and her friends in Valley Village, California, a {{district}} in the San Fernando Valley portion of Los Angeles, which is portrayed as an autonomous city within the show. Silverman plays a fictionalized version of herself, an unemployed woman who leads an irresponsible life. Her most notable trait is her undiluted, childlike <b>self-absorption,</b> which commonly leads to awkward comedic situations in which she insults friends, family, and total strangers. The show tackled issues such as abortion, racism, and same-sex marriage; it was canceled after three seasons. The show was filmed at Hollywood Center Studios, Hollywood, California.|$|E
25|$|Agnes’s {{relationship}} with her daughter, Julia, does not fare much better. Julia also embarrasses her mother. When Julia becomes hysterical, Tobias asks Agnes to go talk to their daughter. Agnes’s response is, “I haven’t the time.” Instead of empathizing with Julia, Agnes becomes more self-absorbed. She tells her husband that she has suffered far more than her daughter. This same <b>self-absorption</b> is apparent in all of Agnes’s relationships. She easily becomes lost in self-pity {{and at the same}} time believes herself to be above everyone around her. If she is the fulcrum of the balance in the family, Albee portrays her as a very unstable one. Albee has admitted that the character of Agnes is based on his real-life adopted mother.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people with}} anxiety {{disorders}} benefit from joining a self-help or support group (telephone conference-call support groups or online support groups being of particular help for completely housebound individuals). Sharing problems and achievements with others, {{as well as}} sharing various self-help tools, are common activities in these groups. In particular, stress management techniques and various kinds of meditation practices and visualization techniques can help people with anxiety disorders calm themselves and may enhance the effects of therapy, as can service to others, which can distract from the <b>self-absorption</b> that tends to go with anxiety problems. Also, preliminary evidence suggests aerobic exercise may have a calming effect. Since caffeine, certain illicit drugs, and even some over-the-counter cold medications can aggravate the symptoms of anxiety disorders, they should be avoided.|$|E

500|$|... "Why Does This Always Happen To Me?" [...] emulates {{the style}} of Ben Folds. According to music critic Nathan Rabin, the song [...] "amplifies the noxious <b>self-absorption</b> of the American {{character}} to hilarious extremes" [...] by describing a narrator who, upon hearing {{about a number of}} horrible tragedies, only complains about the (minor) inconveniences that affect him. [...] Folds himself plays piano on the track. Yankovic later told The A.V. Club: [...] "Ben and I are old friends at this point, and of course I sought his keyboard work for that song. So he came in and knocked it out. I think that’s an F-Sharp, so he was kind of mad at me for that." [...] "Bob" [...] is a style parody of Bob Dylan, composed entirely of palindromes (for instance, the song's first line is [...] "I, man, am regal—a German am I", which reads the same when reversed). Rabin argues that the song's lyrics [...] "sound cryptic enough to be genuine Dylanesque, but are in fact palindromes deliver in an uncanny re-creation of Dylan's nasal whine." [...] The album's closer, [...] "Genius in France", emulates the idiosyncratic style of Frank Zappa. Zappa's son, Dweezil performed the song's intro guitar solo. Lyrically, the song describes a person who, although rejected elsewhere, finds acceptance in France.|$|E
500|$|Author Joley Wood {{compared}} [...] "Lisa the Skeptic" [...] to {{an alternate}} reality game, {{in analyzing the}} effects of watching the television program Lost on contemporary culture and our own perceptions of reality. Dan O'Brien cited the episode {{in a discussion of}} ontology, skepticism, and religious faith, in his book An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge. O'Brien leaves it up to the reader {{to decide whether or not}} Lisa was justified in her skepticism. In , [...] "Lisa the Skeptic" [...] is cited as a prime example of why Lisa is seen as the epitome of a nerd. The book also cited the episode in noting that Lisa is not infallible, for when the Angel appeared to speak at the end of the episode she became as frightened as everyone else. Lisa's frustration with the marketing gimmick used by the mall developers is seen by Turner's [...] as yet another example of her conflict with corporations throughout the series. Like O'Brien, Turner also analyzed the episode in the context of Lisa's questions about existentialism, <b>self-absorption,</b> and consumption. In , the authors discuss Lisa's level of anger displayed in the episode, noting that in this particular case her anger gave her the wherewithal both to confront social injustice, and keep her mind clear for critical thinking. Mark Demming of Allmovie noted that Lisa symbolically stood for the side of reason, while her mother Marge symbolized belief and spirituality in the episode.|$|E
500|$|A male-centred {{viewpoint}} dominated English-language {{comic books}} throughout the 20th century and, with few exceptions, placed women in subordinate roles as victims, helpers, or sex objects. [...] To academic Katie Mullins, Seth's narrative viewpoint follows from this tradition, though the book superficially has {{little in common}} with the masculine adventuring generally associated with mainstream comic books. [...] The author's female characters play peripheral roles, and the character's obsessive collecting and <b>self-absorption</b> alienate him from relationships with females, who at times encourage him to find meaning in life outside comics—advice he ignores. [...] The book highlights the overwhelmingly masculine homosociality of the collector's world, which Seth hints at with the name of the [...] "Book Brothers" [...] book store the character frequents. [...] In one panel, the store sign is obscured so that only [...] "Book Brothe" [...] is visible, suggesting a [...] "Book Brothel", and thus evoking the fetishism inherent in collecting. [...] The intelligent Ruthie provides a love interest that nevertheless manages only to feed Seth's self-absorption: he is attracted to her physically and also to her bookishness, but she takes second place in his life to his obsession with Kalo, whose real name she discovers for him. [...] Seth finds he does not know her well enough to give a satisfactory answer to Chester's [...] "So what's she like?" [...] Whenever she leads the conversation to her own thoughts and interests, Seth changes the subject. [...] She ends by leaving him.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{said of the}} Pink Panther films, [...] "I'm {{not sure}} why Mr. Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team, {{though it may be}} because each is a fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all-consuming, epic <b>self-absorption</b> that makes slapstick farce {{initially}} acceptable—instead of alarming—and finally so funny." [...] Film critic Elvis Mitchell has said that Sellers {{was one of the few}} comic geniuses who was able to truly hide behind his characters, giving the audience no sense of what he was really like in real life. A feature of the characterisations undertaken by Sellers is that, regardless of how clumsy or idiotic they are, he ensured that they always retain their dignity. On his playing of Clouseau, Sellers said: [...] "I set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because I feel that he thinks he is probably one of the greatest detectives in the world. The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot. I thought a forgivable vanity would humanise him and make him kind of touching." [...] His biographer, Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, Sellers is [...] "the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they are." [...] Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers's performances in the Pink Panther films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment. Wesson considers that [...] "As 'low' and 'high' comedy rolled into one, it's the performative counterpoint to Edwardian sophisticated naturalism". This combination of [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low", exemplified by Clouseau's attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within the film Clouseau was [...] "the sole representative of humanity". Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that Sellers had a [...] "balance between character and absurdity". Richard Attenborough also thought that because of his sympathy, Sellers could [...] "inject into his characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being".|$|E

2500|$|Only {{recently}} have sceptics focused on other perceived {{aspects of the}} Countess's personality: arrogance, stubbornness, blind devotion to an unworthy husband, and a disingenuous cleverness seen as taking the literary form of a tendency toward <b>self-absorption</b> and self-absolution that somehow never casts her in a negative light. For all these flaws, real or imagined, the saga of the prisoner of the Blue Tower [...] the fall of a mighty woman and her rise from despair to an even greater intellectual and spiritual might, as told {{against the backdrop of}} Europe during the Reformation [...] remains deeply compelling, even inspiring, as much to artists and the devout as to historians, patriots and feminists.|$|E

[...] In these, he described the steps he believed were necessary for anyone wishing to pursue a spiritual life. [...] They consist of learning to follow God's guidance as an [...] "inner voice" [...] in one's mind, uncovering the past failures that keep one trapped in a negative cycle of <b>self-absorption,</b> and learning the qualities necessary to live as one of God's servants.|$|E

[...] In Church and State, Cerebus, after becoming Pope, uses brutal methods to teach morality lessons.

He confesses to a poor memory but it is more a result of an abiding <b>self-absorption.</b> [...] "Pozzo is a character who has to overcompensate.

2500|$|Drake's songwriting is {{characterized}} by wistful introspection, existential contemplation, and minimal boasting, with lyrics that convey frankness, vulnerability, melancholia, and narcissism. Andy Gill of The Independent writes that he [...] "eschews anger or threat for a weariness shadowed by wistful regret." [...] Music journalist Greg Kot comments that Drake does not [...] "indulge in the macho poses that have dominated mainstream hip-hop for decades, and blur the line between singing and rhyming", adding that he [...] "makes his rhymes sound conversational, matter of fact, like he’s talking to the listener one-one-one". Tim Sendra of AllMusic notes that his [...] "introspective tone [...] is only rarely punctured by aggressive tracks, boasts, and/or come-ons." [...] Drake's persona on songs shows traits of sincerity, self-doubt, regret, passive-aggressiveness, and <b>self-absorption.</b> Kazeem Famuyide of The Source explains his conflicted persona as being [...] "arrogant enough to know his place {{as one of the}} most successful artist in hip-hop, and comfortable enough to realize his own faults in his personal life." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone writes that Drake [...] "collaps many moods – arrogance, sadness, tenderness and self-pity – into one vast, squish-souled emotion." [...] Kevin Ritchie of NOW notes [...] "an overwhelming sense of alienation, and sadness" [...] on Take Care, calling it [...] "an idiosyncratic, aggressively self-conscious and occasionally sentimental album".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{reportedly}} [...] "dismissed by most {{critics as}} 'strange' and 'unintelligible'" [...] {{at the time}} of its release, the film received positive reviews from 71% of 34 surveyed critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Bill Cosford of The Miami Herald praised it as [...] "an unusual film": [...] "Its comedy springs from that odd combination of self-effacement and <b>self-absorption</b> that characterized some of the Saturday Night Live characters and continues to provide Bill Murray with work. And though Buckaroo Banzai is basically a comic strip, it's also relentlessly hip, hipper even than it is goofy." [...] Cosford added, [...] "There are inside jokes and 'quotations' from movies, television and pop music, and there's lots of weird activity on the edges of the film, so much that I suspect Banzai might even be rewarding the second time around. First or second, the film defies easy explanation. But it's anarchic comedy for the 1980s, closest in spirit to the Marx Brothers as they might have been if they grown up on themselves, and had had the benefit of post-Star Wars special effects. It's also adventure in the Buck Rogers mold, the aliens employing a wide array of weaponry, including Arachnids From Space, the good guys fighting back from a mobile command post aboard the Cavaliers' doubledecker tour bus. The pace of both jokes and action is that of Airplane!, and to say much more is only to spoil the fun." ...|$|E

60|$|This poem is {{not simply}} a {{dramatic}} study. It bears very directly on Tennyson's philosophy of life. In these early poems he has given us four studies in the morbid anatomy of character: 'The Palace of Art', which illustrates the abuse of aesthetic and intellectual enjoyment of self; 'The Vision of Sin', which illustrates the effects of similar indulgence in the grosser pleasures of the senses; 'The Two Voices', which illustrates the mischief of despondent <b>self-absorption,</b> while the present poem illustrates the equally pernicious indulgence in an opposite extreme, asceticism affected for the mere gratification of personal vanity.|$|E

He was less inclined to shun his fellow-creatures, had become friendly with the Vicar, and had even let Albinia take him into Mrs. Dusautoy's drawing-room, where he had been fairly happy. Having once begun taking his wife out in the carriage, he found this much more agreeable than his solitary ride, and was in the condition to which Albinia had once imagined it possible to bring him, in which gentle means and wholesome influence might lead him imperceptibly out of his morbid habits of <b>self-absorption.</b>|$|E

In {{the course of his}} argument he ranged with leisurely <b>self-absorption,</b> from ancient Egypt and the sacred Crocodile down through the dark ages, touching at Athens and Mount Olympus, reviewing Rome and the court of Charlemagne, winding up at four P.

60|$|Now in {{philosophy}} this attitude of mind has not as yet been achieved. A certain <b>self-absorption,</b> not personal, but human, has marked almost {{all attempts to}} conceive the universe as a whole. Mind, or some aspect of it--thought or will or sentience--has been regarded as the pattern after which the universe is to be conceived, for no better reason, at bottom, than that such a universe would not seem strange, and would give us the cosy feeling that every place is like home. To conceive the universe as essentially progressive or essentially deteriorating, for example, is to give to our hopes and fears a cosmic importance which may, of course, be justified, but which we have as yet no reason to suppose justified. Until we have learnt {{to think of it}} in ethically neutral terms, we have not arrived at a scientific attitude {{in philosophy}}; and until we have arrived at such an attitude, it is hardly to be hoped that philosophy will achieve any solid results.|$|E
