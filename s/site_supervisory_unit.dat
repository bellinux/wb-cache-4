A finite family of stabilizing controllers is pre-designed, with the assumption that, for any possible operating condition, at least one controller is able to achieve a prescribed level of attenuation. Then, at each time instant, a <b>supervisory</b> <b>unit</b> selects the controller associated with the best potential performance {{on the basis of}} suitably defined test functionals. In the paper, we prove some important properties which are satisfied by the test functionals, and analyze the stability of the overall switched system.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how multinational corporations (MNCs) selectively assign <b>supervisory</b> responsibilities to <b>units</b> {{in countries with}} varying levels of institutional quality. Arbitraging across institutional contexts is an important function of MNCs, but it also creates coordination challenges. The choice of organization structure, such as the differential assignment of supervisory responsibilities, is an important tool for managing these coordination challenges. Using data on the business activities and supervision relationships within U. S. multinational manufacturers in 1996 - 2008, I find that frontline subsidiaries in countries with weaker institutions {{are more likely to}} be supervised by foreign rather than domestic <b>supervisory</b> <b>units.</b> Foreign supervision is even more likely when subsidiaries in weak-institution countries conduct activities that are more central to or interdependent with their parents’ global operations. These findings confirm that MNCs use differential supervision to enhance global coordination. The paper highlights one of the most unique features of MNCs: a multinational hierarchy that resides within firm’s boundary but across national borders. It also connects MNCs’ hierarchical structure with institutional imperfections that give rise to the emergence of the firm in the first place...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{attenuating}} unknown and possibly time-varying disturbances {{acting on a}} linear time-invariant dynamical system is addressed {{by means of an}} adaptive switching control approach. Given a family of pre-designed stabilizing controllers, a <b>supervisory</b> <b>unit</b> infers in real-time the potential behavior of each candidate controller and selects the one providing the best potential performance. To this aim, a set of test functionals is defined, which is shown to enjoy favorable inference properties under certain assumptions {{on the nature of the}} disturbances. Both persistent-memory and finite-memory test functionals are analyzed. Further, an implementation of the switching controller is proposed which always guarantees stability of the feedback loop, even if the disturbance characteristics are such that the switching is persistent. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Safety Culture is a multi-dimensional {{indicator}} of employees’ psychological, behavioural and situational responses to safety management in an organization. The behavioural aspect {{is concerned with}} “what people do” within the organization, and it includes the safety-related activities, actions and behaviours exhibited by employees. Situational aspects describe “what the organization has for its policies, operating procedures, management systems, control systems, communication flows and workflow systems”. Psychological aspects {{can be described as}} “how employees see and feel their organization in respect of safety”. Safety culture is regarded as an {{indicator of}} the organizational effectiveness of safety management performance. The study bridges three gaps identified in the existing literature through the development of a framework which identifies the motivation factors and behaviour that enhance an organization’s safety culture through testing the framework among a sample of site management staff, <b>site</b> <b>supervisory</b> staff and workers. These issues were explored as, firstly, there is a lack research to identify what are the motivational factors that bring about enhancement of the organizational safety culture. Secondly, there is very little research on the type of behaviour that can improve the safety culture of the organization. Thirdly, very few studies have explicitly explored the effect of the combination of motivation factors and behavioral factors together to achieve an improved safety culture. The study adopted a quantitative approach method. Five hypotheses concerning the relationship amongst the types of motivation factors, a type of pro-social behaviour and the combination effects on safety culture were tested quantitatively. Data were collected through questionnaire survey from 60 construction sites in Hong Kong including 60 site management staff, 125 <b>site</b> <b>supervisory</b> staff, and 250 workers. These three groups of respondents’ data were used to test the hypotheses by the use of correlation and hierarchical regression analyses. The results of the analyses were further verified through interviewees on 20 sites with a total of 20 respondents from each group of respondents. The findings of the study suggest that there are common motivational and behavioural factors among these three groups of employees that can enhance safety culture. The workers display a greater range of motivational and behavioural factors for enhancement than do the site management staff and the <b>site</b> <b>supervisory</b> staff. The findings also suggest that there is a mediation effect coming from the behavioral factors upon the motivational factors when they exist concurrently. This study contributes to the field of safety management by developing a theoretical framework for safety culture that can be applied at both attitudinal and behavioural levels. This provides the basis for comprehensive evaluation of motivation and behavioural factors with their relationship to safety culture in existing safety management settings; thus, it can point to strategies to be used to improve the effectiveness of the safety management system in the Hong Kong construction industry. The research also provides a generic model which can be developed for use for risk management in general. published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Quality performance on construction projects has been conceived {{as a function of}} the design process that occurs before the design of the product, site team collaboration and interpersonal relationships, high work-place-supervision, on-site motivation and role definition. This conception has culminated in postulated determinants of quality achievement on construction based on a theoretical understanding. Aspects of measure of perceived design core job characteristics and site organisationand- management phenomena were factor analysed. The verification of the postulated determinants was accomplished by testing of a network of eight main hypotheses using multivariate analytical technique in multiple regression. Varied results emerged with four main hypotheses supported, two partially supported and the remaining two unsupported by data. The assertion is that manipulative actions on design core job characteristics, team collaboration and consensus with mutual understanding and agreement on project goals, mutual exchange with <b>site</b> <b>supervisory</b> staff and subordinates, and role definitions conducted within an integrated framework would contribute an aggregated beneficiary effect on quality achievement on construction projects...|$|R

40|$|Unfalsified Control Theory {{has been}} {{developed}} to provide a way for avoiding modeling uncertainties in controller design. It belongs to the class of control methods called Adaptive Supervisory Switching Control, which work by introducing in the control scheme a <b>supervisory</b> <b>unit</b> which chooses, from a set of candidate controllers the one most suited for the current plant. Unfalsified Control works by using a switching logic that dispenses {{with the need for}} a-priori knowledge of the dynamic model. At discrete moments of time, using the input/output data recorded up to that point, the supervisory calculates for each candidate controller a performance index, and compares it to a given threshold. Controllers surpassing that threshold are removed from the candidate controller set. This process is called falsification. If the controller in the loop is one such falsified controller it is replaced. In this paper we investigate the suitability of this method for aeronautical control applications. We review the theory behind this control scheme and adapt it to the case of controlling a fighter aircraft.

Up until {{around the}} year 2000, China’s domestic services market existed without government oversight. 5 It wasn’t until 2001 that the government acknowledged the work of domestic workers and classified it as a bona fide occupation.

The Msinistry divided domestic workers into primary class (state professional qualifications fifth class), intermediary class (fourth class) and high class (third class). According to this standard, “domestic service worker” refers to “a person who according to requirements of the served family manages household chores, takes care of children, the elderly or the sick, and manages matters connected with the household”. Localities one after another established household services associations {{with the objective of}} “strengthening the professional self-discipline, standardizing professional behaviour, protecting the rights and interests of enterprises and enhancing the standards of the domestic services industry”.

40|$|Abstract—In an {{aircraft}} electric power system, {{one or more}} <b>supervisory</b> control <b>units</b> actuate a set of electromechanical switches to dynamically distribute power from generators to loads, while satisfying safety, reliability and real-time perfor-mance requirements. To reduce expensive re-design steps, this control problem is generally addressed by minor incremental changes on top of consolidated solutions. A more systematic approach is hindered {{by a lack of}} rigorous design methodologies that allow estimating the impact of earlier design decisions on the final implementation. To achieve an optimal imple-mentation that satisfies a set of requirements, we propose a platform-based methodology for electric power system design, which enables independent implementation of system topology (i. e. interconnection among elements) and control protocol by using a compositional approach. In our flow, design space exploration is carried out as a sequence of refinement steps from the initial specification towards a final implementation by mapping higher-level behavioral and performance models into a set of either existing or virtual library components at the lower level of abstraction. Specifications are first expressed using the formalisms of linear temporal logic, signal temporal logic and arithmetic constraints on Boolean variables. To reason about different requirements, we use specialized analysis and synthesis frameworks and formulate assume-guarantee contracts at the articulation points in the design flow. We show the effectiveness of our approach on a proof-of-concept electric power system design. I...|$|R
