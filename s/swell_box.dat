500|$|Between 2006–2008 Sydney firm [...] "John W Parker – Pipe Organ Builders" [...] {{refurbished}} the organ, {{returning the}} soundboard action to electric, providing a new roll-top 'detached' console, and {{an entirely new}} wind supply and bellows. The <b>swell</b> <b>box</b> which had been discarded in the 1975 rebuild was reinstated, and the pedal Bourdon 16' stop was extended to 8' pitch. Octave couplers were provided in Sub and Octave pitches on the Swell also. All manual pipework was washed, cleaned and regulated to original Hill standards and tonality.|$|E
500|$|In England, many pipe organs {{were taken}} out of churches during the English Reformation of the 16th century and the Commonwealth period. Often these were {{relocated}} to private homes. At the Restoration, organ builders such as Renatus Harris and [...] "Father" [...] Bernard Smith brought new organ-building ideas from continental Europe. English organs evolved from small one- or two-manual instruments into three or more divisions disposed in the French manner with grander reeds and mixtures. The Echo division began to be enclosed in the early 18th century, and in 1712 Abraham Jordan claimed his [...] "swelling organ" [...] at St Magnus-the-Martyr {{to be a new}} invention. The <b>swell</b> <b>box</b> and the independent pedal division appeared in English organs beginning in the 18th century.|$|E
500|$|Enclosure {{refers to}} a system that allows for the control of volume without {{requiring}} the addition or subtraction of stops. In a two-manual organ with Great and Swell divisions, the Swell will be enclosed. In larger organs, parts or all of the Choir and Solo divisions may also be enclosed. The pipes of an enclosed division are placed in a chamber generally called the <b>swell</b> <b>box.</b> At least one side of the box is constructed from horizontal or vertical palettes known as swell shades, which operate in a similar way to Venetian blinds; their position can be adjusted from the console. When the swell shades are open, more sound is heard than when they are closed. [...] Sometimes the shades are exposed, but they are often concealed behind a row of facade-pipes or a grill.|$|E

5000|$|Organ voicers strove for an {{articulate}} pipe speech {{characterized by}} a short burst of [...] "chiff" [...] sound {{at the start of}} each note, and avoided [...] "nicking" [...] the pipe edges and other techniques of achieving symphonic-style [...] "smoothness". Low wind pressures were revived. Casework was sometimes eschewed in favor of open standing pipework, and shuttered <b>swell</b> <b>boxes</b> became less common.|$|R
2500|$|Cavaillé-Coll is {{responsible}} for many innovations that revolutionized organ building, performance and composition. Instead of the Positif, Cavaillé-Coll placed the Grand-Chœur manual as the lowest manual, and included couplers that allowed the entire tonal resources of the organ to be played from the Grand-Chœur. He refined the English <b>swell</b> <b>box</b> by devising a spring-loaded (later balanced) pedal with which the organist could operate the swell shutters, thus increasing the organ's potential for expression. He adjusted pipemaking and voicing techniques, thus creating a whole family of stops imitating orchestral instruments such as the bassoon, the oboe and the english horn. He popularized the harmonic flute stop, which, together with the montre, the gambe and the bourdon, formed the fonds (foundations) of the organ. He introduced divided windchests which were controlled by ventils. [...] These allowed the use of higher wind pressures and for each manual's anches (reed stops) to be added or subtracted as a group {{by means of a}} pedal. Higher wind pressures allowed the organ to include many more stops of 8' (unison) pitch in every division, so complete fonds as well as reed choruses could be placed in every division, designed to be superimposed on top of one another. Sometimes he placed the treble part of the compass on a higher pressure than the bass, to emphasize melody lines and counteract the natural tendency of small pipes (especially reeds) to be softer.|$|E

50|$|This has its drawbacks. No {{matter how}} a <b>swell</b> <b>box</b> is designed, {{the sound of}} the pipes is {{compromised}} by enclosing them. Since much of the best organ music was written before gradual crescendo and decrescendo effects became common, this would seem to represent an unfortunate and unnecessary degradation of the music. On the other hand, building an organ with no <b>swell</b> <b>box</b> - and thus unable to play later music - would also seem to be an unfortunate compromise.|$|E
5000|$|Garza started boxing amateur at 18 {{years old}} and did it for three years. He won the Golden Gloves all three years, along with other big tournaments and was also on the US boxing team. Garza turned pro in 1982 {{at the age of}} 21. Working his way up the ranks he got his opportunity, in 1988, Garza won the WBC Americas light welterweight {{championship}} with a spectacular first-round knockout of former world champion Harry Arroyo, Arroyo was knocked down three times in the fight. Later on that year Garza knocked out former world champion Charlie Brown (boxer) (other wise known as [...] "Choo Choo" [...] Brown) in four rounds. In 1989, Garza, with a single right hand in the 7th round, knocked out former world champion Joe Manley. Manley was out cold. Couple months later on August 12, 1989, Garza won a unanimous decision in a 12-round war to win the USBA championship over #1 ranked contender Frankie Warren; Garza fought the last 5 rounds with his left eye <b>swelled</b> shut. Many <b>boxing</b> annals argue that Garza vs. Warren should have been the fight of the year. [...] Then on August 17, 1990, with only two weeks' notice Garza flew to Nice, France and won the WBA light welterweight world title by majority decision over the reigning 3 time world champion Juan Coggi, Garza looked sharp with a beautiful display of counter punching. He came back to his hometown of Sacramento and defended his world title against former 5 time world champion Vinny Pazienza. Garza out-smarted and out-boxed Pazienza and had his face bloody and battered, Pazienza was frustrated throughout the fight and in the 11th round Pazienza picks up Garza and tried to slam him in the ring, so the referee disqualified Pazienza. The following year Garza lost the belt to Edwin Rosario.|$|R
60|$|But {{while the}} abbey church itself is as plain as almost any similar edifice I remember, its great extent, and the noble windows and doors, {{rendered}} {{it to me}} deeply impressive. On the other hand, the chapel is an exquisite specimen of the most elaborated ornaments of the style. All sorts of monstrosities have, at one period or another, been pressed into {{the service of the}} Gothic, such as lizards, toads, frogs, serpents, dragons, spitfires, and salamanders. There is, I believe, some typical connexion between these offensive objects and the different sins. When well carved, properly placed, and not viewed too near, their effect is far from bad. They help to give the edifice its fretted appearance, or a look resembling that of lace. Various other features, which have been taken from familiar objects, such as parts of castellated buildings, portcullises, and armorial bearings, help to make up the sum of the detail. On Henry the Seventh's chapel, toads, lizards, and the whole group of metaphorical sins are sufficiently numerous, without being offensively apparent; while miniature portcullises, escutcheons, and other ornaments, give the whole the rich and imaginative--almost fairy-like aspect,--which forms the distinctive feature of the most ornamented portions of the order. You have seen ivory work-boxes from the East, that were cut and carved in a way to render them so very complicated, delicate, and beautiful, that they please us without conveying any fixed forms to the mind. It would be no great departure from literal truth, were I to bid you fancy one of these <b>boxes</b> <b>swelled</b> to the dimensions of a church, the material changed to stone, and, after a due allowance for a difference in form, for the painted windows, and for the emblems, were I to add, that such a box would probably give you the best idea of a highly-wrought Gothic edifice, that any comparison of the sort can furnish.|$|R
50|$|In 1910 {{the only}} {{significant}} changes {{were made to the}} instrument with the replacement of Schulze’s “borrowed” solo manual with an independent department in its own <b>swell</b> <b>box.</b> Another new swell-box was provided for the echo organ making it in the words of Magnus Black “inaudible above the traffic except {{in the early hours of}} the morning”. The echo <b>swell</b> <b>box</b> shutters have since been removed! A large leathered No1 Diapason, standing in its own separate chest, was added to the Great at this time. It was removed in 1959.|$|E

50|$|No {{matter how}} well a <b>swell</b> <b>box</b> is designed, {{the sound of the}} pipes is altered by their enclosure. Even when the {{shutters}} are fully opened, the pipes do not speak as clearly into the room as they would if they were otherwise unenclosed. On pipe organs, the expression pedal {{should not be confused with}} the crescendo pedal, which progressively adds stops as it is opened.|$|E
50|$|The {{usual way}} of dealing with this problem is to build an organ in which the pipes are divided into several {{sections}} or divisions, one or more of which are enclosed in a <b>swell</b> <b>box</b> or boxes, the other divisions remaining unenclosed. Fortunately, the kinds of music which are least compatible with enclosed pipes are precisely the kinds where gradual crescendo and dimenuendo are not required.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in 1682; in 1700 he was a chorister of the Chapel Royal, under John Blow. In 1710 he was {{appointed}} organist at St Lawrence Jewry in London, and in 1713 he became organist at St Magnus, London Bridge. The organ there, built in 1712, {{was the first in}} England to have a <b>swell</b> <b>box,</b> and in February 1712 Robinson gave the first public performance of this organ.|$|E
50|$|This {{instrument}} {{was built in}} 1987 and can be placed anywhere in the cathedral {{to serve as a}} continuo instrument. Its five ranks of pipes are enclosed in a <b>swell</b> <b>box</b> and played from a single manual. The organ has four speaking stops, no pedals and a transposer allowing it to be pitched at either standard pitch of A440 or at A415 for authentic performance of early music.|$|E
5000|$|The Vox Humana stop {{should be}} {{enclosed}} {{in a wooden}} box, by itself, WITHIN the <b>Swell</b> <b>box</b> (a [...] "box within a box" [...] arrangement); note that the [...] "inner box" [...] (the one holding just the Vox Humana pipes) may be permanently enclosed or it may have shades/shutters that can be set open or closed by a control on the console. In a neo-Baroque style instrument, the Vox Humana would likely not be enclosed.|$|E
50|$|Voluntary in D minor (Op.5 no.6) - John StanleyThe Cornet {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{characteristic}} colours of the English eighteenth-century organ. This organ used to have two, one on the Great and an Echo Cornet inside the <b>Swell</b> <b>box,</b> but since Russell’s remodelling, this has been lost. The Cornet we have now was made by Noel Mander, and reconstructed by Goetze and Gwynn. This voluntary shows off the Cornet in its usual flamboyant manner, with almost continuous semiquavers from beginning to end.|$|E
5000|$|Between 2006-2008 Sydney firm [...] "John W Parker - Pipe Organ Builders" [...] {{refurbished}} the organ, {{returning the}} soundboard action to electric, providing a new roll-top 'detached' console, and {{an entirely new}} wind supply and bellows. The <b>swell</b> <b>box</b> which had been discarded in the 1975 rebuild was reinstated, and the pedal Bourdon 16' stop was extended to 8' pitch. Octave couplers were provided in Sub and Octave pitches on the Swell also. All manual pipework was washed, cleaned and regulated to original Hill standards and tonality.|$|E
50|$|During {{the next}} major {{reconstruction}} (1863-1865), the great organ was given a Romantic layer. The work {{was carried out by}} an organ master from Szczecin- Friedric Kaltschmidt. Wulff’s organ was enriched by a mechanical tracker action and 32 new registers. He left the 52 already existing ones (however, some of them were renewed) and all the front pipes. In accordance with the trend of the time, manual three (Kronwerk) was by Kaltschmidt enclosed into a <b>swell</b> <b>box.</b> The instrument now consisted of 84 registers assigned to 3 manuals and one pedal.|$|E
50|$|The {{reason this}} {{arrangement}} is necessary {{is that a}} given pipe only plays at one given loudness. If the wind pressure were varied {{in an attempt to}} change the loudness, the pitch, tone quality, attack and decay and other characteristics would also change. In fact, organbuilders {{have to go to a}} lot of trouble to provide a steady, unchanging wind supply. So the only way to gradually increase or decrease the loudness of a pipe is to enclose it in a <b>swell</b> <b>box,</b> and then to gradually open or close the shutters.|$|E
5000|$|In an organ, [...] "Swell" [...] (German: [...] "Schwellwerk;" [...] French: [...] "Récit") {{refers to}} the {{division}} whose pipes are enclosed in a <b>swell</b> <b>box.</b> This box has a large opening covered with moveable shades or shutters which resemble heavy venetian blinds. When open, these shutters allow the pipes' sounds to travel freely from the box to the room. When closed, most of the sound is contained in the box. Thus the moveable shades provide a means of adjusting the loudness of the sound, and perhaps more importantly, of gradual crescendo ("swelling") and decrescendo.|$|E
50|$|Behind the organ's 16-field façade {{with its}} 124 {{sounding}} {{and up to}} seven-metre-tall organ pipes are found several ranks of pipes in their original configuration and piping on the slider chest, reconstructed in 1982. All 14 pedal ranks are freestanding behind it. Furthermore, also standing there, in three levels, is the <b>swell</b> <b>box,</b> added in 1982, along with its attendant works. It contains an assembly of ranks added after 1868, with one dedicated {{to the sound of}} French Romantic organ music. The organ has 5,116 pipes and 30 percussion devices shared across 66 stops, and is played from four manuals and one pedalboard.|$|E
50|$|Enclosure is {{the term}} for the device that allows volume control (crescendo and diminuendo) for a manual without the {{addition}} or subtraction of stops. All the pipes for the division are surrounded by a box-like structure (often simply called the <b>swell</b> <b>box).</b> One side of the box, usually that facing the console or the listener, will be constructed from vertical or horizontal palettes (wooden flaps) which can be opened or closed from the console. This works {{in a similar fashion}} to a Venetian blind. When the box is 'open' it allows more sound to be heard than if it were 'closed'.|$|E
50|$|The St Jacobi organ, sited in {{the west}} gallery {{alongside}} another large but modern pipe organ, has 60 stops (registers) and around 4000 pipes, the oldest of which is from 1512. Over 80% of the pipes are from 1693 or earlier. The case of the organ shows clearly the manual and pedal divisions. The Rückpositiv division, controlled from the lowest manual, hangs off the upper gallery. The Brustwerk is immediately above the console; above that is the Hauptwerk and then the Oberwerk at the top. None of the divisions is expressive (contained within a <b>swell</b> <b>box).</b> The Pedal pipes are contained within the two Pedal towers either side. This configuration is called the Hamburger Prospekt.|$|E
5000|$|In England, many pipe organs {{were taken}} out of churches during the English Reformation of the 16th century and the Commonwealth period. Often these were {{relocated}} to private homes.

50|$|However, some {{instruments}} had {{a system}} to bypass the reservoir if the player wanted more direct control. Reed organs often had a form of swell shutter mechanism. The bellows system and reed ranks were contained in a wooden frame. By covering this frame, a <b>swell</b> <b>box</b> was created. A single shutter {{in the top of}} the box, inside the organ case, allowed the volume to be controlled. Since the player's feet were needed to operate the bellows, the swell shutter was controlled by a lever operated by the player's knee. The lever operated horizontally, and the player pushed their knee towards the side of the instrument to open the shutter. The lever returned to the 'closed' position on a spring or a locking mechanism could be enagaged to hold the shutter open.|$|E
