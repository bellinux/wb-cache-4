40|$|Lightweight {{building}} materials are now commonly employed {{in many countries}} in preference to heavyweight materials. This has lead to extensive research into the sound transmission loss of double leaf wall systems. These {{studies have shown that}} the wall cavity and <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>material</b> placed within the cavity play a crucial role in the sound transmission through these systems. However, the influence of the wall cavity on the sound transmission loss is not fully understood. The purpose of this research is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the role played by the wall cavity and any associated <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>material</b> on the sound transmission loss through double leaf wall systems. The research was justified by the fact that some of the existing prediction models do not agree with some observed experimental trends. Gösele’s theory is expanded and used in the creation of an infinite and finite vibrating strip model in order to acquire the desired understanding. The sound transmission loss, radiated sound pressure and directivity of double leaf systems composed of gypsum boards and glass have been calculated using the developed model. A method for calculating the forced radiation efficiency has also been proposed. Predictions are compared to well established theories and to reported experimental results. This work also provides a physical explanation for the under-prediction of the sound transmission loss in London’s model; explains why Sharp’s model corresponds to Davy’s with a limiting angle of 61 ° and gives an explanation for Rindel’s directivity and sound transmission loss measurements through double glazed windows.

The complexity of the design and simulation of WCPP is then resolved using quarter modelling technique. The perforation ratios investigated are 30 % and 40 %.

40|$|Low-frequency {{noise is}} hard to tackle by {{traditional}} <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>material</b> because of its inherent high acoustic impedance and space limitation for installing such material. There is a significant sound reflection at the air-absorber interface due to the high impedance mismatch with ambient air and hence the sound wave {{does not have a}} chance to enter the absorber for dissipation. The performance of <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>material</b> lining in the duct is even worse due to the grazing incidence on the air-absorber interface. The motivation of this study is twofold: (a) to extend the effective range of sound absorption to lower frequencies by filling helium gas in the porous material lining in the duct, and (b) to tackle low frequency noise with a thin layer of the porous material with near-grazing incidence. The work represents a further extension of our recent investigation of the sound propagation in helium-filled porous material. The acoustic impedance can be reduced by filling a low density gas such as helium in the porous material. This has been validated experimentally. Based on the acoustic properties of the helium-filled material found from the new function established in a recent publication by the authors of this paper, the sound absorption performance of helium-filled duct-lining (HDL) is investigated experimentally and theoretically in the current paper. This helps find out the optimal fibre diameter and the lowest frequency for achieving the 10 dB based on the expansion ratio of an empty expansion chamber of 6. 5 which is high enough to assess the performance of silencer. There is good agreement between the theoretical prediction and experimental validation in terms of transmission loss, relative absorption coefficient and reflection coefficient. Helium-filled duct lining performs much better than air-filled duct lining in the thin and long configuration at low frequencies. It is because helium gas contributes large wave refraction that can enhance the sound absorption.

It is important to control the noise in order to minimize extraneous noise in rooms, buildings, and our environment. Noise control can be achieved by reducing the intensity of sound to the level that is not harmful to human ear.

In fact, the most recognized technique to reduce noise is <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> on the <b>materials</b> itself. <b>Sound</b> <b>absorption</b> on <b>material</b> such as wood and porous material have been developed and studied by few researchers.

40|$|With the {{development}} of the industry and the society, noise pollution becomes increasingly severe, especially in large cities. Generally, there are three major noise sources, namely industrial noise, traffic noise and community noise. In response, several measurements have been developed to achieve effective noise control. Examples of noise control methods are reduction of noise at source and abatement of noise during the transmission. Since noise sources are more difficult to control, and sometimes already fixed, noise control during sound transmission is more broadly applied. Traditional passive noise control techniques include Helmholtz resonators and noise <b>absorption</b> <b>materials</b> like felt, glass mineral. The <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>materials</b> (SAM) are found to be efficient in attenuating noise in high frequency domain, but their performance at low frequencies is quite poor. On the other hand, the Helmholtz resonator works perfect at any target frequency but suffers from its narrow absorption bandwidth, so that it’s only effective within a limited frequency band. As an innovative solution to passive noise control problem, micro-perforated panel absorber (MPPA) has attracted great interest in recent years. It {{turns out to be a}} competitive alternative to <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>materials</b> and Helmholtz resonator. The parallel and series arrangement of MPPAs backed with cavities of different depths allows them to obtain decent noise absorption performance over a relatively broad frequency range. However, the performance of MPPA is restricted by its volume, as large volume is demanded for decent low-frequency absorption, which is also the case for noise <b>absorption</b> <b>materials.</b> In this thesis, a potential way to improve the low-frequency performance of the MPPA without occupying extra volume is proposed and implemented to tests. The focus is the adjustment of speed of sound and it is beneficial in different applications such as the following. In low frequency noise control, the size of the absorber in at least one dimension is often related to the wavelength and it is often too long. With a reduced speed of sound one can reduce this size while keeping the overall volume constant. Along this line of thinking, the effect of cavity configuration on its acoustic properties is investigated by two steps. Firstly, the property of a waveguide consisting of several identical elements is studied. The number of element is chosen to magnify the effect of the configuration. It turns out the irregularity of the duct shape can slow down the speed of sound of the plane wave by increasing the acoustic mass. Secondly, the absorption performance of an MPPA backed with an irregular cavity is evaluated. The shape of the cavity is the same as the element in the first step. In advance, the parallel arrangement of two MPPAs backed with irregular cavities is investigated, in order to look into the effect of cavity shape on inter-resonator interaction. The final results indicate that cavity design is an effective method to enhance the noise absorption performance of the MPPA arrays in the low-frequency domain. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

A variant of this method is introduced in this study in which the microphone is fixed at one position while a rigid end plate moves between two positions to resolve the standing wave. The sound source is installed as a side branch, and its driving signal is also used as a reference in the two-step measurement. Close agreement is found with the established two-microphone method, and factors which might affect the accuracy of the new technique are discussed. As a demonstration of the robustness of the method, a low-budget electret microphone is used and the result also matches well with those obtained by the two-microphone method with high-quality condenser type microphones. © 2004 Acoustical Society of America. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A micro {{perforated}} panel (MPP) is a device {{consisting of a}} thin plate and submillimeter perforations for reducing low frequency noise. MPPs have many advantages compared to traditional <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>materials,</b> such as durability and designability, {{and they can be}} used in a variety of places such as room interior designs, passenger and crew compartments of aircrafts and combustion engines. The models in this study were designed and fabricated with the latest 3 -D printing technology. The transmission loss and <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient of the 3 -D printed double-leaf MPPs with honeycomb cavities were studied. According to the established theory, MPPs work well with the help of a backing and a cavity. Earlier experimental and theoretical developments have suggested that the acoustic performance of the MPPs can be improved by partitioning the backing cavity. A Brüel 2 ̆ 6 Kjær type 4206 impedance tube was used for the experiments and the one-load method was implemented for calculating the absorption and transmission coefficients of the MPPs. A honeycomb structure was chosen to be placed in the cavity because it can provide the required partitions between {{perforated panel}}s so that the overall transmission loss was expected to be higher than those without the cavity partitioning. Measured results indicated that use of the honeycomb structure in the cavity have improved the acoustic performance of the MPPs. The <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient of a double-leaf MPP was similar to that of a single-leaf MPP if the cavity was long enough. Future studies should involve an investigation of the acoustic performance of the MPPs at oblique angles of incidence because the current study only provides the pertinent information at normal incidence since the standing wave tubes were used in the experiments...|$|R
