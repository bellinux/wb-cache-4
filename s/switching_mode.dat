50|$|R/C BECs {{in their}} {{simplest}} form use a linear fixed voltage regulator with its standard circuit {{suggested in the}} manufacturer's datasheet - usually the power supply of the receiver needs 5 V. Low-drop types are preferred - especially for batteries {{with only a few}} cells. For small models, 1.5 to 2 A are enough; for mid-size models a 3 A type needs to be considered. BECs for large models have to provide current of 5 A or more. In this case, a more complicated <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> regulator should be used, as the <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> BECs are more electrically efficient than linear regulator BECs. The power dissipation losses in a linear regulator BEC are a product of the difference between the target voltage of 5 volts and the voltage of the main battery multiplied by the required current. For example, take a 10-cell NiMh accumulator with a normal voltage of 12 volts. With a peak current of 5 A, the BEC will have losses of (12 V − 5 V) × 5 A = 35 W. With a linear regulator, these 35 W will be converted to heat and so require a large heat sink. This is an efficiency of (5 V / 12 V) = 41.7%. However, a <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> regulator with a buck step-down supply can achieve over 90% efficiency. In all cases, {{it is a good idea}} to mount some large capacitors to buffer the regulated output. In large plane or ship models, another possibility is to buffer the power supply with a further capacitor near the actuators (servos).|$|E

5000|$|In Europe (but {{not most}} other PAL areas), SCART {{connectors}} are typically used, which can carry composite and analog RGB interlaced video signals (RGB can be progressive, {{but not all}} DVD players and displays support this mode) or Y/C (S-Video), as well as analog two-channel sound and automatic 4:3 or 16:9 (widescreen) switching on a single convenient multi-wire cable. The analog RGB component signal offers video quality which is superior to S-Video and identical to YPbPr component video. However, analog RGB and S-Video signals can not be carried simultaneously, due to each using the same pins for different uses, and displays often must be manually configured as to the input signal, since no <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> exists for S-Video. (A <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> does exist to indicate whether composite or RGB is being used.) Some DVD players and set-top boxes offer YPbPr component video signals over the wires in the SCART connector intended for RGB, though this violates the official specification and manual configuration is again necessary.

50|$|Power {{handling}} and dissipation of devices {{is also a}} critical factor in design. Power electronic devices may have to dissipate tens or hundreds of watts of waste heat, even switching as efficiently as possible between conducting and non-conducting states. In the <b>switching</b> <b>mode,</b> the power controlled is much larger than the power dissipated in the switch. The forward voltage drop in the conducting state translates into heat that must be dissipated. High power semiconductors require specialized heat sinks or active cooling systems to manage their junction temperature; exotic semiconductors such as silicon carbide have an advantage over straight silicon in this respect, and germanium, once the main-stay of solid-state electronics is now little used due to its unfavorable high temperature properties.|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} of miniaturised excitation circuitry in portable systems and transducer integrated front ends is challenging {{due to the}} requirements for high voltage and high current generation. Arbitrary excitation performed using digital to analog converters and high specification amplifiers cannot be easily miniaturised. Switched excitation circuitry can easily miniaturised but requires careful waveform design to achieve arbitrary excitation. Previously, Harmonic Reduction Pulse Width Modulation (HRPWM) has been proposed to allow the design of low harmonic content <b>switched</b> <b>mode</b> excitation signals through a parameterized design process. This paper proposes the technique arbitrary-HRPWM (AHRPWM) to allow the synthesis of three and five level true arbitrary <b>switched</b> <b>mode</b> excitation waveforms.

5000|$|The {{power supply}} {{circuits}} in electronic equipment that produce direct current (DC) {{needed by the}} device from the alternating current (AC) supplied by mains use filter capacitors to smooth the DC current. A large electric charge can remain in these capacitors after the unit is turned off, constituting a shock hazard. For example <b>switching</b> <b>mode</b> power supplies use a bridge rectifier to convert mains AC power into DC at 320 V (for 220 V mains) or 160 V (for 115 V. mains), before the voltage is reduced by the chopper. These incorporate one or more filter capacitors to smooth the pulsing output voltage from the rectifier. These must typically store enough energy at this high voltage to power the load during the zero crossings of the AC input. In addition, the capacitors in many supplies are made large enough to supply the load during AC outages lasting for a significant fraction of a second. This stored charge is often enough to deliver a lethal shock. The capacitors in high voltage DC power supplies used in devices such as lasers, x-ray machines, radio transmitters and old style CRT computer monitors and televisions can have higher, more dangerous voltages.|$|E
