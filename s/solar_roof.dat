25|$|Using a <b>solar</b> <b>roof,</b> {{solar cells}} can provide {{electric}} power. Solar roofs {{have the potential}} to be more cost-effective than retrofitted solar power, because buildings need roofs anyway. Modern solar cells last about 40 years, which makes them a reasonable investment in some areas. At a sufficient angle, solar cells are cleaned by run-off rain water and therefore have almost no life-style impact.|$|E

25|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>roof</b> ponds {{are unique}} solar {{heating and cooling}} systems {{developed}} by Harold Hay in the 1960s. A basic system consists of a roof-mounted water bladder with a movable insulating cover. This system can control heat exchange between interior and exterior environments by covering and uncovering the bladder between night and day. When heating is a concern the bladder is uncovered during the day allowing sunlight to warm the water bladder and store heat for evening use. When cooling is a concern the covered bladder draws heat from the building's interior {{during the day and}} is uncovered at night to radiate heat to the cooler atmosphere. The Skytherm house in Atascadero, California uses a prototype roof pond for heating and cooling.|$|E
25|$|New Jersey {{leads the}} nation with the least {{restrictive}} net metering law, while California leads in total number of homes which have solar panels installed. Many were installed because of the million <b>solar</b> <b>roof</b> initiative. California decided {{that it is not}} moving forward fast enough on photovoltaic generation and in 2008 enacted a feed-in tariff. Washington state has a feed-in tariff of 15 ¢/kWh which increases to 54 ¢/kWh if components are manufactured in the state. By 2015, California, Hawaii, Arizona and some other states were lowering payments to distributed solar owners and instituting new fees for grid usage.

40|$|Greece ranks 5 th {{worldwide}} {{with regard}} to per capita installed photovoltaic (PV) capacity. € 4. 5 billion was invested in PV in Greece during the last 5 years. In 2014, PV is expected to cover 7 % of electricity demand. For a small country in an unprecedented financial crisis, this performance is indeed amazing. There {{is a very good}} reason for this: a brave support mechanism. This has skyrocketed the market, especially during the period 2011 – 2013, and reached a cumulative installed PV capacity of 2. 6 GWp in June of 2014. However, this very mechanism has also overheated the market. High feed-in-tariffs and dramatic decreases of PV costs, since 2011, have led to an installation boom that the electricity market cannot sustain anymore. The Greek State took measures by reducing the fed-in-tariffs in existing and new installations, with result to bring new installations market into a halt. Today, the installed capacity of <b>solar</b> <b>roofs</b> is approximately 373 MW numbering 41. 217 installations. The purpose of the present paper is: (i) to analyse the current market situation of the roof mounted photovoltaic systems in Greece, focusing also in environmental benefits and attempts to segment the development of this market based on the legislation and the incentives, (ii) investigates the existing policy, as well as the crucial barriers for the continuation of the development of <b>solar</b> <b>roofs</b> and (iii) records the market proposals for the future...|$|R
