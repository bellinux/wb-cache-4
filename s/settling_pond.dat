Before {{reaching}} the city, {{the water is}} pumped through a <b>settling</b> <b>pond,</b> two storage ponds, and a treatment plant where it is flocculated, filtered, and chlorinated. The city also provides drinking water for Pouce Coupe and rural residents. Sewage is processed by a lagoon system east of town and released into the Pouce Coupe River.|$|E
25|$|Less complex {{variants}} of this process, such as simple lime neutralization, may involve {{no more than}} a lime silo, mixing tank and <b>settling</b> <b>pond.</b> These systems are far less costly to build, but are also less efficient (i.e., longer reaction times are required, and they produce a discharge with higher trace metal concentrations, if present). They would be suitable for relatively small flows or less complex acid mine drainage.|$|E

At Osborne, South Australia, a <b>settling</b> <b>pond</b> is now used to remove 99% of the CaCl2 as the former discharge was silting up the shipping channel.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{engineering}} wonders {{of the ancient world}} was the Great Dam of Marib in Yemen. Initiated somewhere between 1750 and 1700 BC, it was made of packed earth – triangular in cross section, [...] in length and originally [...] high – running between two groups of rocks on either side, to which it was linked by substantial stonework. Repairs were carried out during various periods, most important around 750 BC, and 250 years later the dam height was increased to [...] After the end of the Kingdom of Saba, the dam fell {{under the control of the}} Ḥimyarites (~115 BC) who undertook further improvements, creating a structure [...] high, with five spillway channels, two masonry-reinforced sluices, a <b>settling</b> <b>pond,</b> and a [...] canal to a distribution tank.

2500|$|Phase 2 {{involves}} a [...] dry section from Little Tring to Drayton Beauchamp (...) , and includes the navigable culvert under the Aston Clinton bypass. Original plans drawn {{up in the}} late 1990s for converting the A41 to a dual carriageway and bypassing Aston Clinton included a low level crossing of the canal, which would have prevented restoration. However, negotiations resulted in the Highways Authority funding a diversion of the canal {{to a point where}} there was sufficient headroom for navigation. The Trust argued that an [...] pipe to carry away rain water from the road would be insufficient in storm conditions, and that excavating [...] of new canal would be a better solution. The old route of the canal has become a reed bed, acting as a <b>settling</b> <b>pond</b> for water from the road, before it joins the new channel. British Waterways funded restoration of a further [...] through Drayton Beauchamp bridge, where repairs to the feeder pipeline which runs along the bottom of the canal were needed to prevent flooding in the village. The pipeline will not be needed once the work is completed. However it will remain in place under the canal, and is having to be capped with concrete to prevent the restored canal collapsing into it. As work proceeds, the channel is being re-profiled, and then lined with Bentomat liner, which consists of a layer of Bentonite clay sandwiched between two layers of geotextile. Concrete blocks have been laid over the liner on the side walls of the channel, with turf above water level. As each new section is re-profiled, the spoil removed is used to cover the bed of the canal on the previous section to a depth of [...]|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of waste matter sedimentation in <b>settling</b> <b>ponds,</b> along with accumulation of heavy metals, such as Nickel (Ni), Chrome (Cr 3 + and Cr 6 +), manganese (Mn) and Cobalt (Co) and elements or compounds in laterite soil. These heavy metals will concentrate in different environmental geochemistry, which are laterite sediment layers pre- and post-mining. The {{purposes of this}} study are to identify changes of heavy metal distribution in <b>settling</b> <b>ponds</b> and analyze heavy metal mobility in <b>settling</b> <b>ponds.</b> The research methods were qualitative and quantitative methods. Laboratory research used AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer) which was studied, analyzed, and synthesized comprehensively. Data processing technique used SPSS v. 21 software and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method. The result showed that distribution of heavy metals Fe and Cr relatively strengthened constantly. The graphs of Fe and Cr were interpreted as similar mobility and mechanism of transportation os elements which can form chemical compounds. Meanwhile, metals Ni and Co had similar graph which was relatively flat constantly. This was interpreted as similar mobility of heavy metals in <b>settling</b> <b>ponds.</b> The mobility of heavy metals Fe and Cr were mostly concentrated to form ferrochrome compound in the sediment of <b>settling</b> <b>ponds</b> compared with Ni with its low mobility and Co with its very low mobility...|$|R
