5|$|After {{signing the}} truce, Muhammad {{assembled}} an expedition against the Jewish oasis of Khaybar, {{known as the}} Battle of Khaybar. This was possibly due to housing the Banu Nadir who were inciting hostilities against Muhammad, or to regain prestige from what appeared as the inconclusive result of the truce of Hudaybiyya. According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad also sent letters to many rulers, asking them to convert to Islam (the exact date is given variously in the sources). He sent messengers (with letters) to Heraclius of the Byzantine Empire (the eastern Roman Empire), Khosrau of Persia, the chief of Yemen and to some others. In the years following the truce of Hudaybiyya, Muhammad directed his forces against the Arabs on Transjordanian Byzantine <b>soil</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Mu'tah.|$|E
5|$|Plants grow {{best in a}} moist but well-drained, acidic soil, {{with added}} peat being helpful. They may be grown in coastal gardens in a {{sheltered}} position, and generally require some degree of shade. Once established, plants can tolerate short dry spells. As they age, plants may become straggly, but benefit from hard pruning after fertilizing and watering, which promotes compact, bushier growth. Common heath can be short-lived and difficult to transplant, though it can be readily grown as a pot plant. Along {{with other members of}} the genus, Epacris impressa initially proved difficult to grow and maintain on original <b>soil</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra.|$|E

5|$|There are {{extensive}} dunes of unconsolidated Holocene sand {{along both}} {{the western and}} eastern sides of the island. The topography of these dunes varies with time: in 1913, Dakin recorded the dunes as being a good deal higher in the east than in the west, but in 1960 Storr found the eastern dunes to be severely eroded, apparently because of a fire that burnt much of the island's vegetation in 1935. In {{the centre of the}} island is a low plain with a sinkhole in its southwest corner and a small salt lake near its northern edge. The <b>soil</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre of the plain is shallow loam, whereas the rim is deeper and composed largely of shell fragments.|$|E
5|$|These two localities are {{unusual in}} having cliff-top dunes of {{siliceous}} sand: cliff-top dunes are an unusual topographic formation, {{and nearly all}} <b>soil</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area is calcareous. As Banksia species are intolerant of calcareous soils, and are not adapted to long range seed dispersal, the two populations of B.epica appear to be reproductively isolated. Nelson has suggested that {{there was once a}} continuous strip of siliceous sand along the coast, providing an extensive and unfragmented habitat for B.epica; rises in the sea level had submerged this strip, leaving only the cliff-top dunes as suitable habitat. The fact that the resultant isolated populations have not perceptibly speciated since then suggests that the species has been fragmented for only a short time, perhaps only since the Last Glacial Maximum.|$|E

Woodfull then made 68 to top-score in the first innings of the second Test in Sydney. Australia conceded another mammoth first innings lead, 383. Woodfull then scored his first Test century in Australia, with 111 in the second innings to force the {{tourists}} to bat again. Despite this, England scored 2/16 to win the match.|$|E

5|$|Freshwater marl prairies {{are similar}} to sloughs, but lack the slow {{movement}} of surface water; instead, water seeps through a calcitic mud called marl. Algae and other microscopic organisms form periphyton, which attaches to limestone. When it dries {{it turns into a}} gray mud. Sawgrass and other water plants grow shorter in freshwater marl than they do in peat, the other type of <b>soil</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Everglades which is found where water remains present longer throughout the year. Marl prairies are usually under water from three to seven months of the year, whereas sloughs may remain submerged for longer than nine months and sometimes remain under water from one year to the next. Sawgrass may dominate sloughs, creating a monoculture. Other grasses, such as muhly grass (Muhlenbergia filipes) and broad-leafed water plants can be found in marl prairies. Animals living in the freshwater sloughs also inhabit marl prairies. Marl prairies may go dry {{in some parts of the}} year; alligators play a vital role in maintaining life in remote parts of the Everglades by burrowing in the mud during the dry season, creating pools of water where fish and amphibians survive from one year to the next. Alligator holes also attract other animals who congregate to feed on smaller prey. When the region floods again during the wet season, the fish and amphibians who were sustained in the alligator holes then repopulate freshwater marl prairies.|$|E
5|$|Hamence {{made his}} debut on English <b>soil</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second tour match against Leicestershire. Batting at No. 6, {{he came in}} at 4/344 and made only seven. His {{dismissal}} triggered a collapse of 5/38 as Australia were bowled out for 448 before winning by an innings. The next match against Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling, was the closest Australia came to defeat on the tour. Batting at No. 4, Hamence made 12 in the first innings as Australia replied to Yorkshire's 71 with 101. He batted slowly, coming in at 2/24 before departing at 7/74. After Australia dismissed the hosts for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 3/13 in pursuit of 60 for victory. Hamence came in and scored one before he was run out after being slow to set off for a quick single; Australia collapsed to 6/31. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia effectively had only three wickets in hand and faced their first loss to an English county since 1912. However, Australia scraped home by four wickets after a counterattack by Neil Harvey and Don Tallon, aided by a dropped catch and missed stumping.|$|E

5|$|Morris {{marked his}} {{first-class}} debut on English <b>soil</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opening match of the tour, against Worcestershire. After the hosts had batted first and made 233, Morris stroked with a fluent 138 (including 19 fours) from 275 minutes. He {{put on an}} opening stand of 79 with Sid Barnes, before adding 186 for the second wicket with Bradman. Australia declared at 8/462 before completing an innings victory. Morris and Bradman's scoring matched one another during their partnership and both were close to being the first Australian century-maker on the tour. The former was on 95 and took three runs to move to 98, before Bradman hit consecutive fours to progress from 91 to 99. The Australian captain failed to score {{for the rest of}} the over, so Morris took the strike in the next over and reached his century before Bradman followed suit. After reaching triple figures, Morris added his last 38 runs in 50 minutes. Morris’s role indicated his standing alongside Barnes as a first-choice opener, as Australia customarily selected its strongest team for the tour opener. The third opener taken on tour, Bill Brown, played out of position in the middle order.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies can {{bioaccumulate}} {{the toxic}} heavy metal arsenic from the <b>soil</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{form of the}} compound methylarsonic acid. Although less toxic than arsenic trioxide, it is still relatively dangerous. Concentrations over 1000mg/kg (dry weight) are often reached. As reported in one 2004 publication, a mature specimen collected {{near the town of}} Český Šternberk in the Czech Republic was found to have an arsenic content of 7090mg/kg dry weight, the highest concentration ever reported in a mushroom. Typically, the arsenic content of mycorrhizal mushrooms collected from unpolluted areas is lower than 1mg/kg. In a 2007 Turkish study of 23 wild edible mushroom species (collected from areas not known to be polluted), S.coronaria had the highest concentration of arsenic at 8.8mg/kg dry weight, while the arsenic concentration of the other tested mushrooms ranged from 0.003mg/kg (in Sarcodon leucopus) to 0.54mg/kg (in Lactarius salmonicolor).|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{house for}} which there is {{evidence}} in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, dating from the Mesolithic period, about 8240 BCE. The earliest stone structures are probably the three hearths found at Jura, dated to about 6000 BCE. With the development of agriculture, groups of settlers began building stone houses on what is now Scottish <b>soil</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Neolithic era, around 6,000 years ago, and the first villages around 500 years later. Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the Northern and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone. The stone building at Knap of Howar at Papa Westray, Orkney {{is one of the oldest}} surviving houses in north-west Europe, making use of locally gathered rubble in a dry-stone construction, it was probably occupied for 900 years, between 3700 and 2800 BCE.
