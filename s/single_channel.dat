5|$|As chief {{engineer}} to the Military Division of the Pacific, {{he was the}} top U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officer on the entire American Pacific Coast. Upon his arrival on the West Coast, he visited locations from Alaska to the Mexican border in order to analyze the work that would be needed. Between 1868 and 1870, he surveyed numerous California harbors and made engineering suggestions as required. One of these suggestions resulted {{in the construction of}} a 7,000-foot breakwater that made Long Beach harbor accessible to large amounts of shipping for the first time. In 1870, he suggested that landowners near Colusa, California, construct levees to contain the Sacramento River within a <b>single</b> <b>channel.</b> The plan would reclaim swampland and control the river's annual floods, making large-scale farming possible. The plan was eagerly seized upon by local residents.|$|E

30|$|Top surface height {{differences}} of channel: Normally, <b>single</b> <b>channels</b> of several different periods develop {{at the same}} time. There is a small difference in the formation time of the different stages of <b>single</b> <b>channels,</b> {{which leads to the}} difference in relative distance between top surface of the channel sand body and top of the formation. That means the relative height of the top surface of the channel sand body varies (Fig.  4 c).|$|R

We have established two methods for forming microscale channels within collagen and fibrin gels.

These methods can form <b>single</b> <b>channels</b> 50 µm {{or more in}} diameter or networks 6 µm or more in width, {{at a rate of}} 5 to 10 samples per day.

25|$|CD-DA, the {{standard}} audio CD, {{is said to}} have a data rate of 44.1kHz/16, meaning that the audio data was sampled 44,100 times per second and with a bit depth of 16. CD-DA is also stereo, using a left and right channel, so the amount of audio data per second is double that of mono, where only a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> is used.|$|E
25|$|CSP uses {{explicit}} {{channels for}} message passing, whereas actor systems transmit messages to named destination actors. These approaches {{may also be}} considered duals of each other, {{in the sense that}} processes receiving through a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> effectively have an identity corresponding to that channel, while the name-based coupling between actors may be broken by constructing actors that behave as channels.|$|E

40|$|Calcium channels, which play {{a primary}} {{role in the}} control of the calcium influx into cardiac cells, were {{initially}} studied by recording macroscopic currents in multicellular preparations. More recently, channel research has combined studies of whole cell calcium currents and elementary currents through <b>single</b> calcium <b>channels,</b> both measured in isolated cardiac cells. These studies provide insight into the mechanism of opening and closing of <b>single</b> calcium <b>channels</b> and enable inferences to be made about the whole cell calcium current from the average gating behavior of <b>single</b> <b>channels.</b> In addition, they promise a more complete understanding of the relation between the biophysical properties and molecular structure of the calcium channel.

40|$|Single {{smooth muscle}} cells were enzymatically {{isolated}} from the rabbit mesenteric artery. At physiological levels of external Ca, these cells were relaxed and contracted on exposure to norepinephrine, caffeine, or high levels of potassium. The patch-clamp technique {{was used to measure}} unitary currents through <b>single</b> <b>channels</b> in the isolated cells. <b>Single</b> <b>channels</b> were selective for divalent cations and exhibited two conductance levels, 8 pS and 15 pS. Both types of channels were voltage-dependent, and channel activity occurred at potentials positive to - 40 mV. The activity of both channel types was almost completely inhibited by 50 nM nisoldipine. These channels appear to be the pathways for voltage-dependent Ca influx in vascular smooth muscle and may be the targets of the clinically used dihydropyridines...|$|R
25|$|Radio Éireann {{tried to}} satisfy all tastes on a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> (with very limited {{programming}} hours). However, {{this resulted in}} a rather conservative programming policy. It was barely tolerated by most Irish listeners, and usually trounced (particularly on the east coast and along the Northern Ireland border) by the BBC and later Radio Luxembourg. This did not really change until Radio Éireann became free of direct government control in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Fuel in a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> in Reactor 2 {{that was}} loaded with fuel {{elements}} under evaluation for the commercial reactor programme experienced a partial blockage, attributed {{to the presence of}} graphite debris (see fuel element failure). The fuel overheated and the Magnox cladding failed, causing contamination to be deposited in one region of the core. The reactor was restarted in 1969 after successful clean-out operations and was the final reactor to cease operation in February 2004.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Ceaușescu {{ordered the}} export {{of much of the}} country's {{agricultural}} and industrial production in order to repay its debts. The resulting domestic shortages made the everyday life of Romanians a fight for survival as food rationing was introduced and heating, gas and electricity blackouts became the rule. During the 1980s, there was a steady decrease in the Romanian population's standard of living, especially in the availability and quality of food and general goods in shops. During this time, all regional radio stations were closed, and television was limited to a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> broadcasting for only two hours a day.|$|E
40|$|In the {{presence}} of a low pH environment, the channel-forming T domain of diphtheria toxin undergoes a conformational change that allows for both its own insertion into planar lipid bilayers and the translocation of the toxin's catalytic domain across them. Given that the T domain contributes only three transmembrane segments, and the channel is permeable to ions as large as glucosamine+ and NAD−, {{it would appear that the}} channel must be a multimer. Yet, there is substantial circumstantial evidence that the channel may be formed from a single subunit. To test the hypothesis that the channel formed by the T domain of diphtheria toxin is monomeric, we made mixtures of two T domain constructs whose voltage-gating characteristics differ, and then observed the gating behavior of the mixture's <b>single</b> <b>channels</b> in planar lipid bilayers. One of these constructs contained an NH 2 -terminal hexahistidine (H 6) tag that blocks the channel at negative voltages; the other contained a COOH-terminal H 6 tag that blocks the channel at positive voltages. If the channel is constructed from multiple T domain subunits, one expects to see a population of <b>single</b> <b>channels</b> from this mixture that are blocked at both positive and negative voltages. The observed <b>single</b> <b>channels</b> were blocked at either negative or positive voltages, but never both. Therefore, we conclude that the T domain channel is monomeric...|$|R

This new trunking system allows Transit Control to communicate directly with a single train, a zone encompassing several trains, or the entire line. Line 3 Scarborough is not included in this system.

25|$|Spotted low-density arrays {{typically}} feature picolitre {{drops of}} a range of purified cDNAs arrayed on the surface of a glass slide. The probes are longer than those of high-density arrays and typically lack the transcript resolution of high-density arrays. Spotted arrays use different fluorophores for test and control samples, and the ratio of fluorescence is used to calculate a relative measure of abundance. High-density arrays use <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> detection, and each sample is hybridised and detected individually. High-density arrays were popularised by the Affymetrix GeneChip array, where each transcript is quantified by several short 25-mer probes that together assay one gene.|$|E
25|$|Windows Media Audio Voice (WMA Voice) is a lossy {{audio codec}} that competes with Speex (used in Microsoft's own Xbox Live online service), ACELP, and other codecs.

It can automatically detect sections of an audio track containing both voice {{and music and}} use the standard WMA compression algorithm instead. WMA Voice supports up to 22.05kHz for a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> (mono) only. Encoding is limited to constant bit rate (CBR) and up to 20kbit/s. The first and only version of the codec is WMA 9 Voice.|$|E

25|$|Itoh et al. (2003) {{developed}} a scaffold {{consisting of a}} single large longitudinally oriented channel was created using chitosan tendons from crabs. Tendons were harvested from crabs (Macrocheira kaempferi) and repeatedly washed with sodium hydroxide solution to remove proteins and to deacetylate the tendon chitin, which subsequently became known as tendon chitosan. A stainless steel bar with triangular-shaped cross-section (each side 2.1mm long) was inserted into a hollow tendon chitosan tube of circular-shaped cross-section (diameter: 2mm; length: 15mm). When comparing the circular-shaped and triangular-shaped tubes, {{it was found that}} the triangular tubes had improved mechanical strength, held their shape better, and increased the surface area available.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Babak Taheri, at University of California, Davis {{demonstrated}} {{the first single}} and also multichannel dry active electrode arrays using micro-machining. The <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> dry EEG electrode construction and results were published in 1994. The arrayed electrode was also demonstrated to perform well compared to silver/silver chloride electrodes. The device consisted of four sites of sensors with integrated electronics to reduce noise by impedance matching. The advantages of such electrodes are: (1) no electrolyte used, (2) no skin preparation, (3) significantly reduced sensor size, and (4) compatibility with EEG monitoring systems. The active electrode array is an integrated system made of an array of capacitive sensors with local integrated circuitry housed in a package with batteries to power the circuitry. This level of integration was required to achieve the functional performance obtained by the electrode.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of an outside-out patch begins with a whole-cell recording configuration. After the whole-cell configuration is formed, the electrode is slowly withdrawn from the cell, allowing a bulb of membrane to bleb out from the cell. When the electrode is pulled far enough away, this bleb will detach from the cell and reform as a convex membrane {{on the end of}} the electrode (like a ball open at the electrode tip), with the original outside of the membrane facing outward from the electrode. As the image at the right shows, this means that the fluid inside the pipette will be simulating the intracellular fluid, while a researcher is free to move the pipette and the bleb with its channels to another bath of solution. While multiple channels can exist in a bleb of membrane, <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> recordings are also possible in this conformation if the bleb of detached membrane is small and only contains one channel.|$|E
