5|$|Front {{tracking}} {{methods have}} long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track the motion of boundaries between different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material. These methods involve deriving the equations of motion of the boundary, and using them to directly <b>simulate</b> <b>the</b> motion of the boundary, rather than simulating the underlying fluid and treating the boundary as an emergent property of the fluid. The same methods {{can also be used}} to <b>simulate</b> <b>the</b> curve-shortening flow, even when the curve undergoing the flow is not a boundary or shock.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For {{multiservice}} loss networks {{the calculation}} of the normalization constant is computationally impossible for realistic sized problems. This paper deals with two methods for <b>simulating</b> <b>the</b> loss probabilities in multiservice loss networks. The regenerative method {{is based on the}} regenerative nature of the process and the simulation is carried out by <b>simulating</b> <b>the</b> DTMC of the process. The second approach tries to combine the effectiveness of Monte Carlo simulation with the computational easiness of <b>simulating</b> <b>the</b> DTMC. Some considerations, on using importance sampling (IS) for increasing the efficiency of the simulations, are also given...|$|R

5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed to <b>simulate</b> <b>the</b> {{motion of particles}} in a fluid or an ideal gas. In such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles. Lattice gas automata simplify these models by only allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either four or six directions of motion) and by simplifying the types of collision that are possible.|$|E
5|$|Climate models use {{quantitative}} methods to <b>simulate</b> <b>the</b> interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice. They {{are used for}} a variety of purposes; from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system, to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.|$|E

However, the game did not perform as strongly as expected by industry analysts, believed to be due to the waning interest in music games during 2009; regardless, DJ Hero is stated by NPD Group to be the highest-grossing new intellectual property of 2009 in North America.|$|E
