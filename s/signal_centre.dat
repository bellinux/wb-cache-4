50|$|Between bunkers ran {{a network}} of {{trenches}} linking the different underground positions, consisting of the headquarters, <b>signal</b> <b>centre,</b> radio room, mess rooms and bathrooms. Every position was connected with each other through {{a network of}} telephone lines buried 2 m or 3 m underground. The entire complex was also surrounded by Tobruk pits (for machine guns), barbed wire and mine fields.|$|E
50|$|There is a level {{crossing}} {{at the eastern}} (London) end of the platforms, where the line crosses Rusper Road. The crossing gates were considered for replacement with modern barriers in the early 1990s but as there was a history of late passengers running over the crossing to catch their train it was dismissed. Therefore, the adjacent signal box was manned 24 hours a day. In October 2012 the {{level crossing}} was rebuilt and automatic barriers installed to replace the old fashioned gates. This meant that the crossing operator's job was now redundant, with CCTV used to control the crossing from the Three Bridges <b>signal</b> <b>centre.</b> This upgrade was finally made necessary due {{to a number of}} incidents of people driving through the wooden gates when closed, resulting in expensive replacement gates having to be constructed.|$|E

50|$|As <b>signalling</b> control <b>centres</b> are {{consolidated}} it {{can become}} necessary to differentiate between older style boxes and newer train control centres, where signalmen may have different duties and responsibilities. Moreover, {{the name of the}} <b>signalling</b> <b>centre</b> itself may not be employed operationally in preference to the name of individual signalling workstations. This is especially true when <b>signalling</b> <b>centres</b> control large amounts of territory spanning many diverse lines and geographical regions.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the change}} of traffic to diesel-haulage from 1969 to 1973, new large {{workshop}} was built at the Neustrelitz locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk). This at first mainly serviced large diesel locomotives of classes 130 and 132. About 2000 railway workers worked at the site Neustrelitz. [...] The tracks through Neustrelitz station were electrified on 2 June 1984. In previous years, the second track towards Waren (Müritz) had been relaid and the station had been rebuilt. Since then the new island platform has been reached via a pedestrian underpass. The line to Neubrandenburg was electrified in 1993. The station building was renovated in 1992. Traffic was abandoned {{on the line to}} Feldberg in 2000. The junction of the line from Mirow was rebuilt in 2003 allowing the track to run directly to the station; since then Neustrelitz Süd station has not handled passenger traffic. The signal systems has been operated since that time by the electronic <b>signal</b> <b>centre</b> at Fürstenberg/Havel, which is controlled from the operations centre in Berlin. In December 2012, the railway operations on the line to Mirow were to have been discontinued due to low ridership. As part of a model project, however, in collaboration with the state and the infrastructure manager, RegioInfra GmbH, four pairs of trains a day between the two cities have continued to be operated by Eisenbahngesellschaft Potsdam.|$|E
50|$|The {{platforms}} were thin with a {{width of}} 5.4 to 6 metres and were 20 centimetres too low. After {{the elimination of}} the 3.2 metre-wide baggage platforms, new passenger platforms were built that are up to 76 centimetres high and up to 10.2 metres wide. In addition, the facilities of the platforms, such as benches, were renewed and some platforms were extended to be 430 metres long. A baggage tunnel was put into operation under tracks 12 and 13. The northern and southern carriage sidings and the maintenance facilities were extended. The construction work began in August 1976. It was completed at Christmas 1987. A new split-flap display was installed in 1981 at the cross platform concourse. The individual platforms, except for the Holzkirchen wing station platforms, were given split-flap destination displays. These replaced panels that were once attached to the buffer stops. Some still exist at the Holzkirchen wing station, but are no longer used. An additional 37 monitors were installed at internal sites such as the ticket office. All displays are controlled by a computer, on which all changes to the basic timetable are stored. They are updated by the <b>signal</b> <b>centre.</b> A washing plant was established to the south of the tracks for Intercity-Express trains in 1991 and in the following years it was expanded into an ICE depot. Since 2004, the entire area of the station has video monitoring. The 70 cameras are controlled by the control center of DB Security in the station. Meanwhile, the split-flap displays have been replaced with more modern LCD displays. The loudspeaker systems have also been modernised.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{parametric}} chirped pulse amplification {{with different}} pump wavelengths was investigated using LBO crystal, at signal central wavelength of 800 nm. According to our theoretical simulation, when pump wavelength is 492. 5 nm, {{there is a}} maximal gain bandwidth of 190 nm. centered at 805 nm in optimal noncollinear angle using LBO. Presently, pump wavelength of 492. 5 nm {{can be obtained from}} second harmonic generation of a Yb:Sr- 5 (PO 4) (3) F laser. The broad gain bandwidth can completely support similar to 6 fs with a spectral centre of seed pulse at 800 nm. The deviation from optimal noncollinear angle can be compensated by accurately tuning crystal angle for phase matching. The gain spectrum with pump wavelength of 492. 5 nm is much better than those with pump wavelengths of 400, 526. 5 and 532 nm, at <b>signal</b> <b>centre</b> of 800 nm. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
