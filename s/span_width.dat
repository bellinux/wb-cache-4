2500|$|To {{avoid the}} {{foundations}} of the roof interfering with the space beneath, and to simplify the design, and minimise cost, it was decided to construct a single span roof, with cross ties for the arch at the station level. The arch was sprung directly from the station level, with no piers. Additional advice on the design of the roof was given to Barlow by Rowland Mason Ordish. The arches' ribs had a web depth of , mostly open ironwork. The <b>span</b> <b>width,</b> from wall to wall was , with a rib every [...] The arch was a slightly pointed design, with a reduced radius of curvature at the springing points. The Butterley Company was contracted to construct the arches. The total cost of the 24 rib roof and glazing was over £53,000, of which over half was for the main ribs. The cost of the gable end was a further £8,500.|$|E

50|$|A large {{driving force}} for these bridges all being {{constructed}} at once {{was that the}} predecessor bridges were all not in compliance with War Department restrictions on bridges crossing navigable waters such as the Ohio, the Allegheny, and the Monongahela.
