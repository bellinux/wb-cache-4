40|$|Abstract We {{report a}} case of sudden {{unilateral}} <b>sensori-neural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> of sudden onset during an aeroplane flight, which completely resolved during a roller coaster ride at Alton Towers theme park. A {{review of the literature}} concerning sudden idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss and spontaneous resolution are discussed. Initially, pure-tone audiometry showed a profound sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and mild sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear (of note, the hearing was normal prior to the episode). Following resolution of the patient’s symptoms during a roller coaster ride, pure-tone audiometry showed normal hearing thresholds in both ears. Sudden <b>sensori-neural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is a symptom of cochlear injury and the mechanism of the patient’s symptoms was attributed to a patent cochlear aqueduct...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionBullous {{myringitis}} {{is defined}} by the presence of blisters on the tympanic membrane which has generally a severe otalgia as a first symptom of presentation. This clinical picture sometimes may be accompanied by <b>sensori-neural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> In this study, we aimed to share visual content of a patient with Bullous myringitis admitted to the emergency department. Case presentationA 24 -year-old male patient complained of a right severe pain in the right ear and hearing loss was admitted to the emergency department. On physical examination the right tympanic membrane was oedematous, hyperaemic and blisters were seen. The patient was referred to ENT department for evaluation of hearing loss. Bullous myringitis with <b>sensori-neural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in the right ear was diagnosed. For treatment, pain control and warm compression was recommended. Antibiotic therapy has been also planned for middle ear infection. ENT follow-up were planned for the assessment of hearing loss. Results and discussionMany microorganisms, especially viruses, m. pneumoniae, chlamydia may cause Bullous myringitis. In the literature bullous myringitis cases that admitted to ED with <b>sensori-neural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> have been reported. Diagnosis is made by clinical examination. Pain control and mild compression may be sufficient for treatment. If concomitant otitis media is present, antibiotics should be added to treatment...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{compared}} the loudness discomfort levels (LDL) {{for a group}} of normal hearing children to those {{for a group of}} children with <b>sensori-neural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses.</b> The children with a loss were students at a school for the deaf. The LDL’s for the frequencies 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz and for speech were obtained. It was found that the sensori-neural loss group had higher LDL’s for both pure tones and speech than the normal hearers. It was further found that for the normal hearers, the LDL’s were higher for speech than for the average of the pure tone speech frequencies.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 44 - 47) Three {{widely used}} prescriptive methods of hearing aid selection, the NAL, the POGO, and the CID Phase IV method were compared {{on the basis}} of prescribed gain, listener quality judgement and speech intelligibility. Fourteen adult subjects with acquired <b>sensori-neural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> no poorer than moderate-to-severe and fit with behind-the-ear amplification for a minimum of three months were tested with the Telex 353 C behind-the-ear hearing aid coupled to their own earmold. Testing was completed over two sessions. Session 1 consisted of pure-tone threshold testing, obtaining most comfortable loudness levels (MCL) and uncomfortable loudness levels (UCL) for pulsed tones, and then unaided sound-field thresholds. Session 2 consisted of assessing each prescriptive method where the order of testing followed the same three step procedure. Step 1 : The Telex 353 C was set to provide the gain determined by the prescriptive method. The real ear insertion response was obtained. Modifications of tone control and SSPL 90 were made to obtain the "best fit" curve. Step 2 : The quality of speech with the aid set to that particular prescribed gain was then determined. A commercially recorded connected discourse (male talker) was presented at 55 dBHL. The subject was asked to rate the quality using eight adjectives. An overall quality rating was also obtained by rating the quality on a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Step 3 : Speech intelligibility was then assessed by presenting the same connected discourse in the presence of an ipsilateral speech noise through the speaker. The speech was held constant at 55 dB HL and the noise was varied in intensity. The subject was instructed to indicate when he/she believed the speech to be approximately 50 % intelligible. The prescribed gain, the rating for quality and the signal-to-noise ratio for each method were statistically analyzed. No significant difference for any variable was found, suggesting that the actual procedure used is not the critical issue in hearing aid selection. Follow up and counseling in assisting the hearing-impaired individual in the use of hearing aids is {{perhaps one of the most}} important factors in a good hearing aid fitting. M. A.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that persons with <b>sensori-neural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> have a narrower dynamic range than persons with normal hearing. This narrow dynamic range could {{be caused by}} elevated thresholds, {{or a combination of}} elevated thresholds and lowered loudness discomfort levels (LDL's). Which of these two possibilities actually takes place is still a question. It has been accepted by many audiologists that the narrow dynamic range is due to the combination of lowered LDL's and elevated thresholds (Fowler, 1963 and Eby and Williams, 1951). Recently some investigators have found results that conflict with the accepted reasons for the narrow dynamic range. They found similar LDL's in normal hearers and persons with sensori-neural losses. In these persons the narrow dynamic range appears to be due solely to the elevated thresholds. It is important to know the LDL's of individuals so that their residual hearing can be used to maximum. By simply knowing a person's threshold, {{it is not possible to}} predict how he will function auditorally when signals are presented above that threshold. A complete picture of auditory ability is needed to determine how a person might function auditorally. When selecting a hearing aid for a person* knowledge of the LDL is important. Hearing aids that can give all the amplification that one will ever need are available. How much amplification a person can use varies among individuals. In the adult or older child no problem exists in determining the maximum amount of amplification that can be used, These persons can tell when sounds are too loud. An infant or young child can not verbalize this. Therefore, if general rules about LDL's can be developed in different kinds of deafness, amplification can be planned for these persons. If it is found that LDL's for some sensori-neural ears are the same as or greater than normal hearers, such a finding requires explanation. It seems that some sensori-neural impairments are accompanied by "overrecruitment". In some of the previous studies where LDL's were found to be more like those of normal hearers recruitment appeared to be non-existent. Perhaps the time of onset of the loss has some bearing on the problem of overrecruitment. Perhaps, also, the site of the lesion and extent of damage determine this. Either of these assumptions could hold the answer as to why recruitment is or is not present. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Myringotomy with {{ventilation}} tube insertion is {{the most}} frequently used sur-gical procedure performed on children to treat otitis media with effusion. The risk of acoustic trauma caused by the suctioning noise during the procedure has not been clearly understood. The objective {{of this study was to}} investi-gate whether the suctioning noise during ventilation tube placement proce-dure damaged children's hearing. Methods: The study was conducted in a prospective manner. The ventilation tube placement procedures were performed on a series of 30 consecutive patients (60 ears). The electro-acoustic signals of the suctioning noises during the procedure were analyzed using a high quality digital tape recording system. The hearing threshold was measured using pure tone audiometry before and after the procedures. Results: The peak intensity of the suctioning noise ranged from 4 kHz to 10 kHz in frequency. The mean intensities of the suctioning noise were 86. 4 9. 6 dB for serous effusion and 96. 4 9. 6 dB for mucoid effusion, respectively. No noise-induced <b>sensori-neural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was observed in this cohort. Conclusions: Even though the peak intensity of the suctioning noise may reach a level of more than 90 dB, it is not likely that the suctioning noise during the ventila-tion tube placement procedure causes noise-induced <b>sensori-neural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss...</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{clinical}} {{reflection of}} isolated vestibular anomaly with normal cochlea is poorly understood {{due to the}} fact that isolated vestibules have been rarely reported to date. This study aimed to describe the radiological and clinical findings of isolated vestibular anomaly. MATERIALS and METHODS: Eleven ears of eight patients with only a radiological diagnosis of complete fusion of the vestibule and lateral semi-circular canal with normal cochlea and normal vestibular aqueduct on high-resolution computed tomography were identified. The clinical records were analysed. RESULTS: Three patients were affected bilaterally and five patients were affected unilaterally. One ear was excluded due to chronic middle ear dis-ease. The fused vestibule-lateral semicircular canal was associated with superior semicircular canal and/or posterior semicircular canal dysplasia in eight ears. The hearing capacity was as follows: normal in four ears; mixed hearing loss in four ears; conductive hearing loss in one ear; and <b>sensori-neural</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in one ear.
