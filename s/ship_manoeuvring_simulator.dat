40|$|Results of captive {{model test}} series {{carried out with}} full form ship models in {{restricted}} waters in the Towing Tank for Manoeuvres in Shallow Water (co-operation Flanders Hydraulics - University of Ghent) are analyzed. Two situations were considered: a hulk carrier in parallel course with a vertical wall, and a panamax bulk carrier in a canal with sloping hanks. Following parameters were varied during the tests: water depth, ship-bank distance, ship speed, propeller rpm, rudder angle, drift angle. The influence of these parameters on lateral force and yawing moment will he discussed. Besides that, the effect on longitudinal force will be taken into consideration. The experimental results are compared with empirical equations published in literature.

40|$|Squat is an {{important}} issue for ships navigating with limited under keel clearance in restricted waterways such as channels and canals. The admittance policy for containerships on the Western Scheldt, a tidal estuary in the Netherlands giving access to the port of Antwerp (Belgium), is based on a minimal static under keel clearance to ensure safe passages on the river. A large number of captive model tests executed in the Towing Tank for Manoeuvres in Shallow Water (co-operation Flanders Hydraulics Research – Ghent University) have been evaluated to determine squat prediction formulae. Measured sinkage and trim depend on a number of parameters like ship velocity components, ship loading condition, propeller action, blockage of the waterway, bank geometries and characteristics of other shipping traffic. The derived mathematical models have been implemented in the <b>ship</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>simulators</b> of FHR to visualize the dynamic under keel clearance during real-time simulations at different locations on the Western Scheldt...|$|R
40|$|In 2003 an {{accessibility}} study {{based on}} real-time simulations for the S-class container ships of Maersk Sealand was performed at Flanders Hydraulics Research {{in cooperation with}} all involved parties (public and port authorities, pilots, tug and shipping company). The regulation for the upstream and downstream navigation on the Western Scheldt did not accept {{the arrival of a}} ship with length over all greater than 340 m. The paper describes two main research studies executed to fill in the gap of knowledge about the manoeuvring behaviour of container ships in shallow and confined water: the accessibility of Ultra Large Container Ships with a maximum capacity of 14, 000 TEU to the Western Scheldt and the accessibility of the Berendrecht Lock and Delwaide Dock located on the right bank of the port of Antwerp. An integrated simulation platform with mathematical models describing hydrodynamic (manoeuvrability, ship-bank and ship-ship interaction) and external (wind, current, tug assistance) forces and coupled <b>ship</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>simulators</b> helped in evaluating the possibilities and limitations of head-on encounters, lock and turning manoeuvres.

40|$|The {{transfer}} of liquid cargo (crude oil and LNG) {{from a larger}} ship (the ship to be lightered, STBL) to a smaller vessel (service ship) when both ships are moored {{to each other and}} sail at a (slow) constant forward speed is known as lightering. These ship to ship operations are expected to increase in the near future and are expected to take place in harsher environmental conditions (polar regions). In order to better understand the hydrodynamic phenomena involved in this specific manoeuvre, a knowledge-building project with user involvement entitled “Investigating Hydrodynamic Aspects and Control Strategies for Ship-to-Ship Operations” was carried out in 2007 – 2011. As a part of this project, more than two thousand captive model tests were carried out at the towing tank for manoeuvres in shallow water (co-operation Flanders Hydraulics Research — Ghent University) in Antwerp, Belgium. A model of a very large crude oil carrier (VLCC) was attached to the main frame of the towing carriage and a model of an Aframax tanker was attached to the computer controlled planar motion carriage. Forces, moments and vertical positions were measured on both models. This paper covers the analysis of the extensive model test data reported by Lataire et al. (2009 a) and the influence of different parameters on the manoeuvre. Particular attention is paid to the forces and moments induced on the service ship by the proximity of the ship to be lightered. A mathematical model of lightering manoeuvres for both the service ship and the ship to be lightered is derived. This model can be implemented in a <b>ship</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>simulator</b> for training purposes...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study was to gather {{information}} regarding methodologies used in marine simulator training. The focus of this study was on instructors who operated courses on <b>ship</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>simulators</b> and on radar and navigation simulators. Since the study included subjects with varying professional and educational backgrounds, it was anticipated that areas of agreement and disagreement about training could be identified. The information gathered in this study helped to identify attitudes about training and program delivery methods commonly used by instructors of marine simulator courses. The study also provided information on the current status of simulator hardware as well as the qualifications of such instructors. [...] A review of the literature revealed that there were a number of issues to be investigated related to the use of simulation. The review identified five areas of simulator operation in which the attitudes and perceptions of the instructor could have an effect on training outcomes. These areas were: general simulator operation, exercise development, exercise briefing, exercise running and exercise de-briefing. [...] Data for the study were gathered by means of a single questionnaire specifically designed for this study. The content validity of the study was ensured by having three experts assess each item. [...] On the basis of the study it was concluded that, while there were statistically significant differences on a number of the individual statements, overall the attitudes and perceptions of instructors toward simulator training were very similar. In general, all groups reacted positively to the majority of statements in all five areas. Many responses from the various sub-groups investigated produced means close to the neutral value of 2. 5 which indicated some degree of uncertainty.

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} marine traffic intensity on inland waterways {{the interaction between}} ships and banks is becoming more of a problem. Bank effects make <b>ship</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> more difficult and rivers need to be protected against ship-induced currents and waves. This thesis contributes {{to the development of}} a new method that simulates these ship-bank interaction effects in real-time. Such predictions are useful in for example manoeuvring simulation and navigation channel design. The developed method represents a ship as a moving pressure field in a numerical model that solves the two-dimensional non-linear shallow water equations in the horizontal plane. An approximation for skin friction is included. The method passes numerical verification. The computed flow field and interaction forces are compared with experimental results in various conditions, showing that the method performs well enough to be useful in the design of navigation channels and to make initial computations on flow fields beneath ships. Modelling errors limit the applicable range of the method so that it is not ready to be used in a general <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>simulator.</b> Recommendations are made to improve the model so that in the future this can be achieved.

40|$|In this paper, a {{nonlinear}} dynamic {{neural network}} model is proposed for the identification of <b>ship</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> coefficients. A generalized Widrow-Hoff learning rule in feed-forward, back propagation networks give reasonable answers when presented with inputs not previously seen.

It is shown that these networks {{can be used to}} identify <b>ship</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> in every practical application, including an open-loop manner. An efficient, quick off-line training process allows the use of neural networks in predicting the ship's future position, speed and heading with input from rudder angle, engine rpm and the ship kinematics.

40|$|Ship {{manoeuvrability}} has a {{close relationship}} with navigation safety. For a ship sailing in the proximity of a pier, its manoeuvrability is different from that in unrestricted waters. To predict the ship manoeuvrability in the proximity of a pier, the method of simulation based on mathematical model is used. The mathematical model of <b>ship</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> is obtained by using Support Vector Machines (SVM) based system identification, combined with free-running model tests. The interaction between the pier and the ship are considered in the mathematical model of <b>ship</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> motion. By analyzing the test results, SVM is applied to identify the hydrodynamic coefficients and the interaction coefficients in the mathematical model. By using the regressive models, the <b>ship</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> motions in the proximity of a pier are predicted. Comparisons between the predicted results and the test results demonstrate the validity of the proposed SVM method. Identification results, model test results as well, also confirm that navigation safety of the ship in the proximity of a pier can be guaranteed if the distance between the pier and the ship is under control. ...|$|R
