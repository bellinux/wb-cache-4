5|$|The concept {{behind a}} Qualifying Industrial Zone is {{credited}} to Omar Salah, a Jordanian businessman. In 1993, {{in anticipation of}} the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, Salah traveled to Israel with the intention of doing business with Israeli businessmen. He was also interested in business ventures that could take advantage of the eight-year-old free trade agreement between the United States and Israel that allowed Israeli goods to enter the US markets duty-free. After the treaty was signed in 1994, a business venture was struck between Salah and Delta Galil, where labor was transferred to Irbid in northern Jordan, to take advantage of low labor costs that were forty to <b>seventy</b> <b>percent</b> lower than in Israel. Salah had envisioned that by exploiting Israeli resources such as labor, finances, and contacts, and then leveraging it to produce value-added goods, the economy of Jordan would be benefited. In addition, he surmised that economic cooperation between the two nations would help foster peace in the region.|$|E

5|$|UPLB admits {{more than}} 2,500 {{students}} and produces about 1,800 graduates every year. Undergraduate admission {{is determined by}} the University of the Philippines College Admission Test (UPCAT). Examinees that select UPLB as their preferred campus and garner a University Predicted Grade (UPG) within the standard cut-off are automatically eligible for admission. Those who do not automatically qualify may file an appeal for reconsideration if their UPG is within the actual cut-off, though the appeal process does not guarantee admission. The cut-off scores may be adjusted according to a variety of factors. In 2010, UPLB had a standard UPG cut-off of 2.42 while the actual cut-off was 2.8 (this actual cut-off was retained in 2011). But in 2014-2015 UPCAT, according to the Office of the University Registrar, UPLB had a standard cut off score of 2.3. <b>Seventy</b> <b>percent</b> of slots are given to incoming freshmen with the highest scores, while the remaining thirty percent are given to public high school students and members of minority groups.

5|$|Polled Dorsets are a {{medium-sized}} sheep that are long lived and prolific, heavy milkers. They produce hardy lambs with moderate growth and maturity that yield heavily muscled carcasses. Their fleece is very white, strong, close, free from dark fiber and extends down the legs. When shorn, fleece averages {{between five and}} nine pounds (2.23 to 4kg) in ewes and fifty to <b>seventy</b> <b>percent</b> of their fleece can be used. The staple length ranges from 2.5 to 4 inches (6 to 10cm) with a numeric count of 46's-58's. The fiber diameter ranges from 27.0 to 33.0 microns. At maturity, ewes weigh between 150 and 200 pounds (67 to 91kg), some weighing more in show condition. Mature rams range in weight from 225 to 275 pounds (102 to 125kg). Dorsets are noted {{for their ability to}} be bred more than once per year and are commonly used in crossbreeding to produce females for out-of-season breeding. They {{are one of the few}} breeds that have this characteristic. Multiple births are common and they work well in commercial operations, including programs where rams are specifically used to sire lambs for slaughter. These rams are known as terminal sires since their genetics are more suitable for slaughter than breeding purposes.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade {{carried out}} a brigade-sized {{parachute}} landing during Operation Dragoon.

Despite the pathfinders' success at marking the drop zones, only seventy-three planes placed their parachutists in the correct location. The brigade commanding officer and eighty men were landed near Fayence, as were the 5th (Scottish) Battalion's commanding officer, with half of battalion headquarters, 'C' Company, and 'D' Company. Other men were landed as far away as Cannes. The dispersed landings resulted in only about forty percent of the 4th Battalion making it to the brigade forming-up point.

40|$|Background: Jumper’s knee is a {{frequent}} chronic overuse syndrome of {{the upper part of}} the patellar tendon. Platelets contain lots of growth factors which could enhance the healing process of tendons. Infiltration of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) may be considered as a recent therapeutic option for chronic tendinopathies. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the clinical status and the return to sports activities in patients with chronic upper patellar tendinopathies up to 1 year after 1 infiltration of PRP. Methods: Twenty patients with chronic upper patellar tendinopathy were enrolled. Assessments were made before infiltration of PRP, and 6 weeks and 3 months and 1 year after the infiltration, using a 10 -point Visual Analogic Scale and algofunctional scores (IKDC and VISA-P). Moreover, they had to answer an information questionnaire concerning their life and sports activities. The PRP was obtained with an apheresis system (COM. TEC, Fresenius). Six millilitres of PRP were injected without local anaesthetic. One week after infiltration, patients started a standardised sub-maximal eccentric reeducation. Results: Pain during daily activities significantly decreased with time. VAS has significantly dropped, IKDC and VISA-P significantly improved over the follow-up of 1 year. <b>Seventy</b> <b>percents</b> of patients reported a favourable evolution with decrease of pain, 15 % did never report any improvement and 15 % were treated surgically. <b>Seventy</b> <b>percents</b> returned to sports activities, 64, 3 % without any pain, and 50 % of them recovered the same sport level. Younger patients seemed to be more susceptible to have an improvement of pain by the PRP infiltration. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a local infiltration of PRP associated with a submaximal eccentric protocol can improve, at 1 year, symptoms of chronic jumper’s knee in patients non-responsive to classical conservative treatments.
