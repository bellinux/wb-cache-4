5000|$|Two more taxa {{occur in}} the {{intergradation}} zone with the <b>small</b> <b>whitethroat,</b> stretching from the northern Caspian Sea area into Mongolia. The phylogeny of these is not well-researched, and they might eventually turn out to belong to either species or be stereotyped hybrids: ...|$|E
5000|$|The lesser {{whitethroat}} complex has been split {{up into the}} present species, Hume's whitethroat, and the <b>small</b> <b>whitethroat</b> from which the Margelanic whitethroat may also be specifically distinct. In this superspecies, the {{lesser whitethroat}} seems to form the basal European lineage. Only two subspecies are nowadays unequivocally recognized for the lesser whitethroat, and they intergrade throughout Central Europe: ...|$|E
50|$|The desert {{whitethroat}} (Sylvia minula) is {{a typical}} warbler. Until recently, it was considered conspecific with the lesser whitethroat; today these are seen {{as members of a}} superspecies. The desert whitethroat together with Hume's whitethroat form an Asian lineage in the superspecies, which have diverged into species adapted to drier lowlands and moister mountain habitats respectively. The name <b>small</b> <b>whitethroat</b> has also been used by some authors, and desert lesser whitethroat before it was split from lesser whitethroat.|$|E
5000|$|The lesser {{whitethroat}} (Sylvia curruca) {{is a common}} and widespread typical warbler which breeds in temperate Europe, except the southwest, and in western and central Asia. This small passerine bird is strongly migratory, wintering in Africa {{just south of the}} Sahara, Arabia and India.Unlike many typical warblers, the sexes are almost identical. This is a small species with a grey back, whitish underparts, a grey head with a darker [...] "bandit mask" [...] through the eyes and a white throat. It is slightly <b>smaller</b> than the <b>whitethroat,</b> and lacks the chestnut wings and uniform head-face color of that species. The {{lesser whitethroat}}'s song is a fast and rattling sequence of tet or che calls, quite different from the whitethroat's scolding song.|$|R
50|$|Rather, {{the lesser}} {{whitethroat}} and its closest relatives Hume's whitethroat and the <b>small</b> <b>whitethroat</b> appear more {{related to a}} group of morphologically quite dissimilar species. These vary much in size and color pattern, but also lack chestnut wing patches and have a strong contrast between the usually dark head sides and the white or whitish throat. The latter group occurs from the southern parts of the lesser whitethroat complex' range into Africa and include the Orphean warbler group, the Arabian warbler, and the brown and Yemen warblers sometimes placed in Parisoma. Thus, it rather appears as if the divergence of the lesser whitethroat complex and its closest living relatives is more ancient than assumed, and that it did not involve separation by ice sheets building up in Europe, but by aridification of the Arabian region (which also occurred throughout the Ice Ages).|$|E
