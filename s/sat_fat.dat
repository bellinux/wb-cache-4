60|$|The {{people of}} Colmar think Colmar to be a {{considerable}} place, and far be it from us to hint {{that it is}} not so. It is--or was in the days when Alsace was French--the chief town of the department of the Haut Rhine. It bristles with barracks, and is busy with cotton factories. It has been accustomed to the presence of a prefet, and is no doubt important. But it is not so large that people {{going in and out of}} it can pass without attention, and this we take to be the really true line of demarcation between a big town and a little one. Had Michel Voss and Adrian Urmand passed through Lyons or Strasbourg on their journey to Granpere, no one would have noticed them, and their acquaintances in either of those cities would not have been a bit the wiser. But it was not probable that they should leave the train at the Colmar station, and hire Daniel Bredin's caleche for the mountain journey thence to Granpere, without all the facts of the case coming to the ears of Madame Faragon. And when she had heard the news, of course she told it to George Voss. She had interested herself very keenly in the affair of George's love, partly because she had a soft heart of her own and loved a ray of romance to fall in upon her as she <b>sat</b> <b>fat</b> and helpless in her easy-chair, and partly because she thought that the future landlord of the Hotel de la Poste at Colmar ought to be regarded as a bigger man and a better match than any Swiss linen-merchant in the world. 'I can't think what it is that your father means,' she had said. 'When he and I were young, he used not to be so fond of the people of Basle, and he didn't think so much then of a peddling buyer of sheetings and shirtings.' Madame Faragon was rather fond of alluding to past times, and of hinting to George that in early days, had she been willing, she might have been mistress of the Lion d'Or at Granpere, instead of the Poste at Colmar. George never quite believed the boast, as he knew that Madame Faragon was at least ten years older than his father. 'He used to think,' continued Madame Faragon, 'that there was nothing better than a good house in the public line, with a well-spirited woman inside it to stand her ground and hold her own. But everything is changed now, since the railroads came up. The pedlars become merchants, and the respectable old shopkeepers must go to the wall.' George would hear all this in silence, though he knew that his old friend was endeavouring to comfort him by making little of the Basle linen-merchant. Now, when Madame Faragon learned that Michel Voss and Adrian Urmand had gone through Colmar back from Basle on their way to Granpere, she immediately foresaw what was to happen. Marie's marriage was to be hurried on, George was to be thrown overboard, and the pedlar's pack was to be triumphant over the sign of the innkeeper.|$|E

There are multiple reports of MR imaging of peripheral nerves in compression and entrapment neuropathies.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve the fat {{suppression}} performance of in vivo 13 C-MRS operating at 3. 0 Tesla, a phantom model study was conducted {{using a combination of}} two fat suppression techniques; a set of pulses for frequency (chemical shift) selective suppression (CHESS), and spatial saturation (SAT). By optimizing the slab thickness for SAT and the irradiation bandwidth for CHESS, the signals of the – 13 CH 3 peak at 49 ppm and the – 13 CH 2 – peak at 26 ppm simulating fat components were suppressed to 5 % and 19 %, respectively. Combination of these two fat suppression pulses achieved a 53 % increase of the height ratio of the glucose C 1 O peak compared with the sum of all other peaks, indicating better sensitivity for glucose signal detection. This method will be applicable for in vivo 13 C-MRS by additional adjustment with the in vivo relaxation times of the metabolites.

40|$|Growth hormone {{replacement}} therapy (GHRT) increases exercise capacity and insulin resistance while it decreases fat mass in growth hormone-deficient patients (GHD). Ectopic lipids (intramyocellular (IMCL) and intrahepatocellular lipids (IHCL) are related to insulin resistance. The effect of GHRT on ectopic lipids is unknown. It is hypothesized that exercise-induced utilization of ectopic lipids is significantly decreased in GHD patients and normalized by GHRT. GHD (4 females, 6 males) and age/gender/waist-matched control subjects (CS) were studied. VO 2 max was assessed on a treadmill and insulin sensitivity determined by a two-step hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. Visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (<b>SAT)</b> <b>fat</b> were quantified by MR-imaging. IHCL and IMCL were measured before and after a 2 [*]h exercise at 50 - 60 % of VO 2 max using MR-spectroscopy (∆IMCL, ∆IHCL). Identical investigations were performed after 6 months of GHRT. VO 2 max was similar in GHD and CS and significantly increased after GHRT; GHRT significantly decreased SAT and VAT. 2 [*]h-exercise resulted in a decrease in IMCL (significant in CS and GHRT) and {{a significant increase in}} IHCL in CS and GHD pre and post GHRT. GHRT didn't significantly impact on ∆IMCL and ∆IHCL. We conclude that aerobic exercise affects ectopic lipids in patients and controls.

40|$|Obesity is a {{risk factor}} for {{cardiovascular}} diseases and type 2 diabetes especially when the fat is accumulated to central depots. Novel biomarkers are crucial to develop diagnostics for obesity and related metabolic disorders. We evaluated the associations between metabolite profiles (136 lipid components, 12 lipoprotein subclasses, 17 low-molecular-weight metabolites, 12 clinical markers) and 28 phenotype parameters (including different body fat distribution parameters such as android (A), gynoid (G), abdominal visceral (VAT), subcutaneous (<b>SAT)</b> <b>fat)</b> in 215 plasma/serum samples from healthy overweight men (n= 32) and women (n= 83) with central obesity. (Partial) correlation analysis and partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis showed that only specific metabolites were associated to A:G ratio, VAT, and SAT, respectively. These association patterns were gender dependent. For example, insulin, cholesterol, VLDL, and certain triacylglycerols (TG 54 : 1 - 3) correlated to VAT in women, while in men VAT was associated with TG 50 : 1 - 5, TG 55 : 1, phosphatidylcholine (PC 32 : 0), and VLDL ((X) L). Moreover, multiple regression analysis revealed that waist circumference and total fat were sufficient to predict VAT and SAT in women.

40|$|Aims/hypothesis: Preferential visceral {{adipose tissue}} (VAT) {{accumulation}} has been clearly associated with insulin resistance. In contrast, {{the impact of}} visceral obesity on beta cell function is controversial. Methods: In 62 non-diabetic women and men (age 24 - 69 years, BMI 21 - 39 kg/m(2)), we measured VAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (<b>SAT)</b> <b>fat</b> mass by magnetic resonance imaging. We also measured insulin secretion and beta cell function by C-peptide deconvolution and physiological modelling of data from a frequently sampled, 75 -g, 3 -h OGTT, respectively. Results: VAT (range 0. 1 - 3. 1 kg) was strongly related to sex, age and BMI; SAT was related to sex and BMI. Controlling for sex, age, BMI and SAT by multivariate analysis, excess VAT {{was associated with a}} clinical phenotype comprising higher plasma glucose levels, BP, heart rate and serum transaminases. The corresponding metabolic phenotype consisted of insulin resistance (partial r=- 0. 38) and hyperinsulinaemia (partial r= 0. 29). The latter, however, was appropriate for the degree of insulin resistance regardless of obesity and abdominal fat distribution. Moreover, none of the model-derived parameters describing beta cell function (glucose sensitivity, rate sensitivity and potentiation) was independently associated with excess VAT. Conclusions/interpretation: In non-diabetic Caucasian adults of either sex, preferential visceral fat deposition in itself is part of an insulin-resistant phenotype. The insulin secretory response to a physiological challenge is increased to fully compensate for the insulin resistance, but the dynamics of beta cell function (glucose sensitivity, rate sensitivity and potentiation) are largely preserved...|$|E

RESULTS — VAT, <b>SAT,</b> pericardial <b>fat,</b> and intrathoracic fat were negatively correlated with adiponectin (r 0. 19 to 0. 34, P 0. 001 [women]; r 0. 15 to 0. 26, P 0. 01 [men] except SAT) and positively correlated with resistin (r 0. 16 – 0. 21, P 0. 001 [women]; r 0. 11 – 0. 14, P 0. 05 [men] except VAT).

40|$|Abstract In this study, {{we asked}} the {{question}} “does �-tocopherol supplementation prevent an increase in total plasma cholesterol (TPC) concentration and reduce the deposition of cholesterol in arterial plaques of rabbits fed atherogenic diets? ” Isocaloric diets containing 0. 1 % cholesterol to induce atherosclerosis were enriched {{in one of three}} fats: saturated <b>fats</b> (<b>SAT),</b> monounsaturated <b>fats</b> (MONO), or n- 6 polyunsaturated fats (POLY). Half of each of the three diets were supplemented with 2, 500 IU �-tocopherol/kg-diet. Unsupplemented diets contained 25 IU �-tocopherol/kg-diet. Rabbits supplemented with �-tocopherol had plasma �-tocopherol concentrations 10 -fold higher and an average TPC concentration 31 % lower, P � 0. 017, than rabbits fed unsupplemented diets. Among the three fat-fed groups, the difference was greatest for the POLY fat fed group (54 %, P � 0. 041). POLY fat-fed rabbits without �-tocopherol supplementation had plasma HDL cholesterol concentrations that were less than half that of rabbits fed other fats, P � 0. 0001. In general, differences in mean esterified artery cholesterol concentrations among the three fat-fed groups, with and without �-tocopherol supplementation, paralleled differences in TPC concentration among the groups. This study suggests that for rabbits fed high pharmacological doses of �-tocopherol, atherosclerosis can be diminished in situations where the plasma cholesterol concentrations are also significantly lower. ...|$|R

Text: The frequency and size of meals may influence chronic disease risk. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 3 different iso-caloric meal patterns on serum lipid, fasting glucose and insulin levels.

Participants were instructed to follow the assigned weight loss diet for 6 months, with subsequent follow up at 9 and 12 months.

All diets met national dietary goals (30 % fat, 14 % <b>sat</b> <b>fat,</b> 45 - 50 % CHO, 15 - 20 % Pro). Fasting bloods were collected and analysed at 3 month intervals. Preliminary findings at 3 months (one way ANOVA) suggest that subjects assigned to 6 D (n= 38) had significantly greater reduction in total cholesterol, compared to 3, 3 D (n= 41) or 3 D (n= 33) : (− 0. 39 (± 0. 9) (±sd) vs. − 0. 13 (± 0. 6), + 0. 09 (± 0. 7) respectively, p= 0. 036) and significantly greater reduction in triglycerides (− 0. 31 (± 0. 7) vs. − 0. 02 (± 0. 5), 0. 02 (± 0. 4), p= 0. 020). No significant differences in fasting glucose, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, insulin, and HOMA score of insulin resistance were noted at 3 months.

40|$|Obesity is {{associated}} with obesity-related chronic inflammation of adipose tissue. Current research has investigated what occurs in visceral (VAT) versus subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) from an immunological perspective. To date, no studies have examined immunological differences in upper body vs. lower body SAT but research suggests that these regions differ in metabolic activity. It is hypothesized that 1) adipocyte size and number, and 2) the quantity and type of immune cells will differ in upper and lower body subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese adults and that these differences will be distinct in early-onset obesity (childhood weight gain) compared to late-onset obesity (adult weight gain). It is also hypothesized that immune cells will be associated with blood lipid concentrations. Thirteen subjects who had early-onset or late-onset obesity were recruited. Visits included fasting blood draws for lipid levels, dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT) scans for body composition, and SAT biopsies of the abdominal and femoral regions. Biopsy tissue samples were digested and stained with antibody markers for CD 3, CD 4 and CD 8 for T-cells, as well as CD 68 and CD 206 for macrophages and were analyzed using flow cytometry. For both groups as a whole, % of CD 4 + T-cells was associated (ρ= 0. 83; P= 0. 042) with cholesterol in the abdominal {{but not in the}} femoral region and HDL cholesterol concentrations were inversely correlated (ρ= - 0. 83; P= 0. 04) with abdominal CD 3 +CD 8 + T-cells but not in the femoral region. These correlations indicate an association between cardiac health risk factors and the presence of T-cells in obesity-induced inflammation. There were no significant differences detected between early- and late-onset groups for body composition, blood chemistry, or between regional depots. However, trends reported indicate that early-onset subjects had more upper than lower body <b>SAT.</b> <b>Fat</b> cell size was higher in the late-onset group while cell number was higher in the early-onset group. As well, T-cells and macrophages were more numerous in the femoral versus abdominal regions.

The aim of the current study is evaluating the efficiency of different MRI sequences in order to better detection of MS plaques. Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study which was performed at Shohada-E Tajrish in Tehran - Iran hospital between October, 2011 to April, 2012, included 20 patients who suspected to MS disease were selected by the method of random sampling and underwent routine brain Pulse sequences (Axial T 2 w, Axial T 1 w, Coronal T 2 w, Sagittal T 1 w, Axial FLAIR) by Siemens, Avanto, 1. 5 Tesla system. If any lesion which is suspected to the MS disease was observed, additional sequences such as: Sagittal FLAIR <b>Fat</b> <b>Sat,</b> Sagittal PDw-fat Sat, Sagittal PDw-water sat was also performed. Results: This study was performed in about 52 lesions and the results in more than 19 lesions showed that, for the Subcortical and Infratentorial areas, PDWw sequence with fat suppression is the best choice, And in nearly 33 plaques located in Periventricular area, FLAIR <b>Fat</b> <b>Sat</b> was the most effective sequence than both PDw fat and water suppression pulse sequences.

The aim of the current study was to estimate the effects of season and stage of lactation as well as genetic parameters of saturated (SAT) and monounsaturated (MONO) fatty acid contents in bovine milk and milk fat, and the ratio of SAT to unsaturated fatty acids (UNSAT) that reflect the hardness of butter (SAT:UNSAT), using 7 multiple-trait, random-regression test-day models. The relationship between these FA traits with common production traits was also studied. The data set contained 100, 841 test-day records of 11, 626 Holstein primiparous cows. The seasonal effect was studied based on unadjusted means. These results confirmed that milk fat produced during spring and summer had greater UNSAT content compared with winter (63. 13 vs. 68. 94 % of <b>SAT</b> in <b>fat,</b> on average). The effect of stage of lactation on FA profile was studied using the same methodology. Holstein cows in early first lactation produced a lower content of SAT in their milk fat. Variance components were estimated using a Bayesian method via Gibbs sampling. Heritability of SAT in milk (0. 42) was greater than heritability of <b>SAT</b> in milk <b>fat</b> (0. 24). Estimates of heritability for MONO were also different in milk and fat (0. 14 vs. 0. 27). Heritability of SAT:UNSAT was moderate (0. 27). For all of these traits, the heritability estimates and the genetic and phenotypic correlations varied through the lactation. Peer reviewe...|$|R
60|$|In an open barouche, {{the horses}} {{of which had}} been taken out, the better to {{accommodate}} it to the crowded place, stood a stout old gentleman, in a blue coat and bright buttons, corduroy breeches and top-boots, two young ladies in scarfs and feathers, a young gentleman apparently enamoured of one of the young ladies in scarfs and feathers, a lady of doubtful age, probably the aunt of the aforesaid, and Mr. Tupman, as easy and unconcerned as if he had belonged to the family from the first moments of his infancy. Fastened up behind the barouche was a hamper of spacious dimensions--one of those hampers which always awakens in a contemplative mind associations connected with cold fowls, tongues, and bottles of wine--and on the box <b>sat</b> a <b>fat</b> and red-faced boy, in a state of somnolency, whom no speculative observer could have regarded for an instant without setting down as the official dispenser of the contents of the before-mentioned hamper, when the proper time for their consumption should arrive.|$|R

And indeed it seemed so, for just then a black-bird, sitting on a garden wall, burst out with a song full of musical joy, Nelly's kitten came running after {{to stare at the}} wagon and rub her soft side against it, a bright-eyed toad looked out from his cool bower among the lily-leaves, and at that minute Nelly found her first patient. In one of the dewy cobwebs hanging from a shrub near by <b>sat</b> a <b>fat</b> black and yellow spider, watching a fly whose delicate wings were just caught in the net. The poor fly buzzed pitifully, and struggled so hard that the whole web shook: but the more he struggled, the more he entangled himself, and the fierce spider was preparing to descend that it might weave a shroud about its prey, when a little finger broke the threads and lifted the fly safely into the palm of a hand, where he lay faintly humming his thanks.|$|R

Everywhere was crowded, the train was stuffy without being warm. Next to Alvina <b>sat</b> a large, <b>fat,</b> youngish Frenchman who overflowed over her in a hot fashion. Darkness began to fall. The train was very late. There were strange and {{frightening}} delays. Strange lights appeared in the sky, everybody seemed to be listening for strange noises. It was all such a whirl and confusion that Alvina lost count, relapsed {{into a sort of}} stupidity. Gleams, flashes, noises and then at last the frenzy of Paris.|$|R

Cutting short their trip, they returned to London, where a telegram awaited them from Dan's Yeomanry regiment, the Sherwood Rangers, telling him to report to duty in Nottinghamshire. Dan turned to their portly cook-butler, Whitaker, {{and asked if he}} was coming too. Hermione recorded that [...] "Whitaker <b>sat</b> there looking <b>fat</b> and rather red, and he said, 'To the war my Lord?' and Dan said 'Yes'. And Whitaker said: 'Very good, my Lord,' as though Dan had asked for a cup of coffee." [...] The exchange was to provide the title of Lady Ranfurly's war diaries, which proved to be an unexpected publishing success in the 1990s.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{evaluate}} whether breastfeeding attenuates increased childhood adiposity associated with exposure to diabetes in utero. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Retrospective cohort study of 89 children exposed to diabetes in utero and 379 unexposed youth with measured BMI, waist circumference, skinfolds, visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (<b>SAT)</b> abdominal <b>fat.</b> A measure of breast milk– months {{was derived from}} maternal self-report and used to categorize breastfeeding status as low (, 6) and adequate ($ 6 breast milk–months). Multiple linear regression was used to model the relationship between exposure to diabetes in utero and offspring adiposity outcomes among youth stratified according to breastfeeding status. RESULTS—Adequate (vs. low) breastfeeding status was associated with significantly lower BMI, waist circumference, SAT, and VAT at ages 6 – 13 years. Among youth in the low breastfeeding category, exposure to diabetes in utero {{was associated with a}} 1. 7 kg/m 2 higher BMI (P = 0. 03), 5. 8 cm higher waist circumference (P = 0. 008), 6. 1 cm 2 higher VAT (P = 0. 06), 44. 6 cm 2 higher SAT (P = 0. 03), and 0. 11 higher ratio of subscapular-to-triceps skinfold ratio (P = 0. 008).

40|$|Obesity is {{characterized}} by insulin-resistance (IR), enhanced lipolysis, and ectopic, inflamed fat. We related the histology of subcutaneous (<b>SAT),</b> visceral <b>fat</b> (VAT), and skeletal muscle to the metabolic abnormalities, and tested their mutual changes after bariatric surgery in type 2 diabetic (T 2 D) and weight-matched non-diabetic (ND) patients. We measured IR (insulin clamp), lipolysis ((2) H 5 -glycerol infusion), ß-cell glucose-sensitivity (ß-GS, mathematical modeling), and VAT, SAT, and rectus abdominis histology (light and electron microscopy). Presurgery, SAT and VAT showed signs of fibrosis/necrosis, small mitochondria, free interstitial lipids, thickened capillary basement membrane. Compared to ND, T 2 D had impaired ß-GS, intracapillary neutrophils and higher intramyocellular fat, adipocyte area in VAT, crown-like structures (CLS) in VAT and SAT with rare structures (cyst-like) ~ 10 -fold larger than CLS. Fat expansion was associated with enhanced lipolysis and IR. VAT histology and intramyocellular fat were related to impaired ß-GS. Postsurgery, IR and lipolysis improved in all, ß-GS improved in T 2 D. Muscle fat infiltration was reduced, adipocytes were smaller and richer in mitochondria, and CLS density in SAT was reduced. In conclusion, IR improves proportionally to weight loss but remains subnormal, whilst SAT and muscle changes disappear. In T 2 D postsurgery, some VAT pathology persists and beta-cell dysfunction improves but is not normalized...|$|R
