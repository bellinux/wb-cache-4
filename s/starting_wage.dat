40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to test whether}} information problems in labor markets can explain why minority or female workers are sometimes paid less than equally-qualified white male workers. In particular, the relationship between <b>starting</b> <b>wages,</b> current performance, and race and sex is studied. OLS regressions of <b>starting</b> <b>wages</b> on current performance [...] which is measured some time after the beginning of employment [...] indicate that minority workers are paid lower <b>starting</b> <b>wages</b> than white workers with the same eventual performance, among both men and women. This may reflect taste discrimination. However, if employers base <b>starting</b> <b>wages</b> on expected productivity or performance, and average performance is lower for minority workers (as it is in these data), then these estimated differentials could reflect simple statistical discrimination. A test of statistical versus taste discrimination and a test of statistical discrimination versus pure measurement error provide some evidence {{for both men and}} women that statistical discrimination is partly to blame for these differences in <b>starting</b> <b>wages</b> between minority and white workers, although the evidence is not very strong statistically. Average performance of women is if anything higher than that of men, so simple statistical discrimination cannot explain the lower <b>starting</b> <b>wages</b> that women receive. However, more complex models of statistical discrimination suggest that worse labor market information about a particular group can generate lower wages for that group. A test of the quality of labor market information suggests that employers have better information about male workers, which may explain the lower <b>starting</b> <b>wages</b> paid to women. Together, this evidence suggests that better labor market information might boost <b>starting</b> <b>wages</b> of minorities and women. ...|$|R

The union has also joined with Global Exchange in calling on Starbucks to purchase at least 5% of the store's coffee from fair trade certified sources. The 12 workers submitted union cards to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for a certification election. Prior to the election, Starbucks filed an appeal with the NLRB, asking that the election be extended to several stores, not the single store that filed for an election.

40|$|Young men {{today are}} {{significantly}} {{worse off than}} their counterparts who entered the labor market in the late 1960 s. <b>Starting</b> <b>wages</b> for young men declined by nearly 10 percent between the late 1960 s and late 1980 s.

On average, young men entering the labor market during the late 1970 s and 1980 s experienced 15 - 20 percent less wage growth over the first 10 years of their careers than did young men who started working in the late 1960 s. Furthermore, this overall decline was accompanied by other changes in the distribution of wage growth that appear to have exacerbated lifetime inequality between young men with different levels of education. Among cohorts that started working in the late 1960 s, workers with a high school education or less experienced 68 percent wage growth over their first 10 years, while college graduates experienced 44 percent wage growth, indicating that returns to experience ameliorated inequality in <b>starting</b> <b>wages</b> among early cohorts. By the early 1980 s, however, wage growth among college graduates had increased to between 50 and 60 percent, while wage growth among those with a high school degree or less had declined to between 40 and 45 percent. Thus, among more recent cohorts, changes in the returns to experience reinforce wage disparities across education groups. The decline in wage growth among young men has important repercussions. Wage growth is one of the primary determinants of lifetime income, and thus these trends have the potential to impact life cycle decisions such as educational attainment, marriage, and home ownership. Moreover, lifetime earnings inequality reflects permanent differences in access to resources across individuals.

This paper demonstrates that lifetime earnings inequality has increased over the past 30 years. We first explore how <b>starting</b> <b>wages</b> and wage growth have changed over time and link the changes to trends in lifetime earnings and the lifetime skill-premium. We then calculated a broader measure of lifetime earnings inequality and show that since the late 1960 s, lifetime earnings inequality has increased by a third. Between the late 1960 s and mid- 1970 s a rise in within-education-group inequality more than accounts for the increase; since then the growth in between-education-group inequality accounted for a majority of the rise. These results are consonant with the data on <b>starting</b> <b>wages</b> and wage growth. Finally, we show that the increase in inequality has been largely driven by greater dispersion in hourly wages, although declining hours of work among low-education young men did play a role.
