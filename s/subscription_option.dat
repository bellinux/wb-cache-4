The game had one million subscribers within three days of its launch, making it the world's [...] "fastest-growing MMO ever", though in the following months the game lost a fair share of its subscriptions.

2500|$|Free-to-play is newer {{than the}} pay to play model, and {{the video game}} {{industry}} is still attempting {{to determine the best}} ways to maximize revenue from their games. Gamers have cited the fact that purchasing a game for a fixed price is still inherently satisfying because the consumer knows exactly what they will be receiving, compared to free-to-play which requires that the player pay for most new content that they wish to obtain. The term itself, [...] "free-to-play", has been described as one with a negative connotation. One video game developer noted this, stating, [...] "Our hope—and the basket we're putting our eggs in—is that 'free' will soon be disassociated with [...] 'shallow' and 'cruddy'." [...] However, another noted that developing freeware games gave developers the largest amount of creative freedom, especially when compared to developing console games, which requires that the game follow the criteria as laid out by the game's publisher. Many kinds of revenue are being experimented with. For example, with its Free Realms game targeted to children and casual gamers, Sony makes money from the product with advertisements on loading screens, free virtual goods sponsored by companies such as Best Buy, a <b>subscription</b> <b>option</b> to unlock extra content, a collectible card game, a comic book, and micropayment items that include character customization options.|$|E
2500|$|The Old Republic is BioWare's first {{entry into}} the massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG) market, and is the second Star Wars MMORPG after Star Wars Galaxies, which was shut down in December 2011. BioWare had long been interested in working on a MMORPG, but waited until they had [...] "the right partners, the right team, and the right I.P." [...] A major focus in the game is on developing characters' individual stories and, in October 2008, BioWare considered this game to have more story content than all of their other games combined. The writing team worked on the project longer {{than any of the}} game's other development teams. An October 2008 preview noted some of the 12 full-time writers had been working on The Old Republic {{for more than two years}} at that point. Although BioWare has not disclosed development costs, industry leaders and financial analysts have estimated it to be between $150 million and $200 million or more, making it, at the time, the most expensive video game made, though if marketing costs are included, it is eclipsed by Grand Theft Auto V, with an estimated cost of $265 million. The game had 1 million subscribers within three days of its launch, making it the world's [...] "fastest-growing MMO ever". However, in the following months the game lost a fair share of its subscriptions, but has remained profitable. The game has since adopted the hybrid free-to-play business model with remaining <b>subscription</b> <b>option.</b> It is estimated that the game made $139 million in additional revenues, in addition to the subscription income, in 2013.|$|E
