The father only has minor {{injuries}} but the police <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> {{he had something to}} do with the incident. Maddy tries to find out what is happening from the father, who is not talking to the police. She seems to have some connection with him but can't seem to put her finger on what it is.|$|E
5|$|According to Domhoff, {{many people}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the United States is ruled {{from behind the}} scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires, i.e., by a small secretive group that wants to change the {{government}} system or put the country {{under the control of}} a world government. In the past the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{position of the}} present Cuban government is still that Mella was killed at Gerardo Machado's orders, but it admits that Tina Modotti was a Stalinist operative who operated {{in a number of}} countries. Yet there are some even in Cuba who <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Vidali did it. Adding to the mystery, according to Albers (2002), both Magriñat and Diego Rivera, who had just returned from Cuba, had warned Mella that he was in danger.|$|E

2500|$|How can we {{talk about}} Pegasus? [...] To what does the word 'Pegasus' refer? [...] If our answer is, 'Something,' then we <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in mystical entities; if our answer is, 'nothing', then we seem to talk about nothing and what sense can be made of this? [...] Certainly when we said that Pegasus was a mythological winged horse we make sense, and {{moreover}} we speak the truth! [...] If we speak the truth, this must be truth about something. [...] So we cannot be speaking of nothing.|$|E
2500|$|Tooke was in Hazlitt's view {{much less}} {{successful}} in public life. In private, {{he could be}} seen at his best and afford amusement by [...] "say the most provoking things with a laughing gaiety". In public, as when he briefly served as a Member of Parliament, this attitude would not do. He did not really <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in any great [...] "public cause" [...] or [...] "show ... sympathy [...] with the general and predominant feelings of mankind." [...] Hazlitt explains that [...] "it was his delight to make mischief and spoil sport. He would rather be against himself than for any body else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although mixers are the {{majority}} group, {{many of them}} retain belief in vertebral subluxation as shown in a 2003 survey of 1100 North American chiropractors, which found that 88% wanted to retain the term [...] "vertebral subluxation complex", and that when asked to estimate the percent of disorders of internal organs (such as the heart, the lungs, or the stomach) that subluxation significantly contributes to, the mean response was 62%. A 2008 survey of 6,000 American chiropractors demonstrated that most chiropractors <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that a subluxation-based clinical approach may be of limited utility for addressing visceral disorders, and greatly favored non-subluxation-based clinical approaches for such conditions. The same survey showed that most chiropractors generally believed that {{the majority}} of their clinical approach for addressing musculoskeletal/biomechanical disorders such as back pain was based on subluxation. Chiropractors often offer conventional therapies such as physical therapy and lifestyle counseling, and it may for the lay person be difficult to distinguish the unscientific from the scientific.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2014, Time was {{met with}} {{controversy}} {{for the release of}} a cover featuring Enrique Peña Nieto and the legend Saving Mexico (written by Michael Crowley), as the cover article's title inside the magazine. The controversial article praised the president and his cabinet for reforms like opening oil fields for foreign investment {{for the first time in}} 75 years (a reform towards which Mexican citizens have shown mixed feelings), ending the Mexican drug wars (which was not completely accurate), and even going as far as saying [...] "the opposition party blocked major reforms that were necessary", that [...] "American leaders could learn a thing or two from their resurgent southern neighbor" [...] and saying Mexicans citizens' [...] "alarms were replaced with applause". The last part proved false, when the cover immediately spawned heavy amounts of backlash on social media, becoming a meme which spawned multiple parody covers ranging from changing the legend to mock words like [...] "Selling Mexico", [...] "Slaving Mexico", [...] "Starving Mexico", [...] "Who is saving Mexico from this ass-hole?" [...] to editing Peña Nieto into clown make-up, dressed as the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ, the Pope, to one featuring an old lady holding a gun with the legend [...] "Saving Mexico... pero de Peña Nieto" [...] (but from Peña Nieto). Multiple articles criticized the article, and some websites even asked Time magazine if Peña Nieto paid for the cover story. This prompted Michael Crowley, the writer of the article, to post on Twitter: [...] "Remarkable how many critics of Mexico's president <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> I must have literally taken a bribe to write a positive story about him".|$|E
