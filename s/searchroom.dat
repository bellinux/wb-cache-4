Some of them, but not all, operate a fee-paying postal service {{for those who are}} unable to make personal research visits. All county record offices attempt to work in accordance with the appropriate official British Standard.|$|R

5000|$|The library {{formerly}} {{housed the}} Furness Museum which held artefacts both {{from across the}} world and also from the local area. The museum (always operated by Barrow Borough Council) was opened in 1930 in an upstairs lecture room. It closed in 1991 {{and most of the}} exhibits were eventually moved to larger purpose built premises next to Walney Channel - the Dock Museum. After building modifications in 1998, the library has also worked with the Cumbria Archive Service in the joint operation of a local archives or county record office branch. This now shares a public <b>searchroom</b> together with the local studies library.|$|E
