Time-course experiments allowed measurements of intact extraradical mycelium spreading from mycorrhizal roots of Prunus cerasifera micropropagated plants inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae, in controlled environmental chambers. The length of extraradical mycelium was significantly increased at the highest CO 2 concentration, ranging from 10. 7 to 20. 3 m at aCO 2 and eCO 2, respectively. The biochemical determination of mycelial glucosamine content allowed the evaluation of intraradical and extraradical fungal biomass, which were 2 and 3 times larger at eCO 2 than at aCO 2. Present data show that Glomus mosseae responds to increases of CO 2 concentrations producing larger mycorrhizal networks which may potentially represent carbon <b>sink</b> <b>agents</b> in soil ecosystems. © 2010 German Mycological Society and Springer...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Context Aware Agent based Military Sensor Network (CAMSN) {{to form an}} {{improved}} infrastructure for multi-sensor image fusion. It considers contexts driven by a node and sink. The contexts such as general and critical object detection are node driven where as sensing time (such as day or night) is sink driven. The agencies used in the scheme are categorized as node and sink agency. Each agency employs a set of static and mobile agents to perform dedicated tasks. Node agency performs context sensing and context interpretation based on the sensed image and sensing time. Node agency comprises of node manager agent, context agent and node blackboard (NBB). Context agent gathers the context from the target and updates the NBB, Node manager agent interprets the context and passes the context information to sink node by using flooding mechanism. Sink agency mainly comprises of <b>sink</b> manager <b>agent,</b> fusing <b>agent,</b> and <b>sink</b> black board. A context at the sensor node triggers the fusion process at the sink. Based on the context, <b>sink</b> manager <b>agent</b> triggers the fusing agent. Fusing agent roams around the network, visits active sensor node, fuses the relevant images and sends the fused image to <b>sink.</b> The fusing <b>agent</b> uses wavelet transform for fusion. The scheme is simulated for testing its operation effectiveness in terms of fusion time, mean square error, throughput, dropping rate, bandwidth requirement, node battery usage and agent overhead...|$|R

We have encoded them using the Joint Scalable Video Model (JSVM) reference software, version 9.19. There are two layers, the base layer and one additional quality enhancement layer, with average bit rates of 6.8 and 23.5 Mbps, respectively. The video is VBR encoded, causing some severe variations in the transmission rate that globally rise over 45 Mbps at some segments of the video. The duration of the encoded stream is 2, 116 frames streamed at 25 frames per second, permitting a test of 88.64 s. The generated SVC file has an average PSNR-Y of 34.46 dB. The sequence is encapsulated in an mp 4 file and hinted with an MTU limit of 1, 460 bytes. Transmission using TCP is treated as a special case {{because it is not}} a message-oriented protocol.

40|$|We study {{efficiency}} and budget balance for designing mechanisms in general quasi-linear domains. Green and Laffont (1979) proved that one cannot generically achieve both. We consider strategyproof budget-balanced mechanisms that are approximately efficient. For deterministic mechanisms, {{we show that}} a strategyproof and budget-balanced mechanism must have a <b>sink</b> <b>agent</b> whose valuation function is ignored in selecting an alternative, and she is compensated with the payments made by the other agents. We assume the valuations of the agents come from a bounded open interval. Using this result, we find a tight lower bound on the inefficiencies of strategyproof, budget-balanced mechanisms in this domain. The bound shows that the inefficiency asymptotically disappears {{when the number of}} agents is large [...] -a result close in spirit to Green and Laffont (1979, Theorem 9. 4). However, our results provide worst-case bounds and the best possible rate of convergence. Next, we consider minimizing any convex combination of in{{efficiency and}} budget imbalance. We show that if the valuations are unrestricted, no deterministic mechanism can do asymptotically better than minimizing inefficiency alone. Finally, we investigate randomized mechanisms and provide improved lower bounds on expected inefficiency. We give a tight lower bound for an interesting class of strategyproof, budget-balanced, randomized mechanisms. We also use an optimization-based approach [...] -in the spirit of automated mechanism design [...] -to provide a lower bound on the minimum achievable inefficiency of any randomized mechanism. Experiments with real data from two applications show that the inefficiency for a simple randomized mechanism is 5 [...] 100 times smaller than the worst case. This relative difference increases with the number of agents. Comment: 30 pages, 3 figures, In proceedings, Web and Internet Economics (WINE), 201...|$|R

30|$|Water {{is a major}} pathway {{through which}} {{pesticides}} are transported from area of primary application to other compartments within the environment, especially the aquatic system. COCs could spread into aquatic environments through runoffs from non-point soil source (Aly Salem et al. 2013). Gilliom (2007) reported that pesticides; particularly those used for agriculture were often detected, and at highest concentrations in stream traversing agricultural area. Once in water, pesticides are further distributed between biotic and abiotic components, such as plants, fishes, benthic organism and sediments. Sediment is a matrix of materials which is comprised of detritus, inorganic and organic particles and is relatively herterogeneous in terms of physical, chemical and biological characteristics (Hakanson 1992). Zheng et al. (2009) underscored roles of sediment as a secondary source of COCs in the environment due to its substantial retention capacity of the organic pollutants which might be re-emitting under favourable conditions into the ecosystem. Hence, it determines distribution and fate of COCs in aquatic environment. In the same vein, Brasher and Anthony (2000) regarded sediment as <b>sink,</b> removal <b>agent</b> and vehicle {{for a host of}} contaminants in marine environs. Consequently, stream’s bed sediment of the study area could be more susceptible to high concentrations of COCs than its surrounding water body.|$|R

Optimal Cluster Head utilizes the limited energy in an efficient manner and hence network lifetime is maximized. Hence the work focuses on an optimal Residue Energy Based algorithm for Cluster Head Selection. In this algorithm, node with maximum residual energy and has good link quality is selected as a Cluster Head in each round of transmission. To predict whether all nodes, {{are able to}} complete its task within the given lifetime requirement, energy bounds are estimated and test will be conducted to check if all nodes are within the bounds or not. To decrease the probability of failure communication between Cluster Head and Mobile <b>Sink,</b> Mobile <b>Agents</b> and Gateway Node are deployed.

30|$|Research has {{attempted}} to understand how money flow in the economy affects the investment and consumption behavior of economic agents. The key lies in the reliance of banking systems and stock markets on {{the confidence of the}} various participants in the economy, including depositors and stock traders. There is widespread belief that the expectations of economic agents have a strong link to economic fluctuations (Beaudry and Portier, 2014; Asker et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2015). When the confidence of individuals, companies, and others is shaken, perhaps because of the failure of a large bank or large commercial firm, they rush to withdraw their deposits out of fear of losing their funds (Bloom, 2014). Similarly, when economic or financial distress arises, the expectations of economic <b>agents</b> <b>sink</b> into uncertainty, which ultimately reduces their willingness to spend on consumer goods and to invest in financial markets (Hansen, Sargent and Tallarini, 1999; Ilut and Schneider, 2014; Hugonnier et al., 2015; Bateman et al., 2015).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{problem of}} {{efficiently}} disseminating {{data from a}} mobile stimulus (source) to multiple mobile users (sinks) in a large-scale sensor network has been challenging. We address this problem by proposing a minimum-energy tree-based data dissemination scheme, Dynamic Localized Minimum-Energy Agent Tree-Based Scheme (DLATS). We exploit the fact that sensor nodes are stationary and location-aware. In DLATS, each sensor node finds its Relative Neighborhood Graph (RNG) neighbors and a RNG is generated over the whole network. Then, the source broadcasts its position information {{to all the other}} nodes using our localized minimum-energy broadcast protocol, Improved RNG Broadcast Oriented Protocol (IRBOP). A dynamic agent tree is generated between each source and multiple sinks using our Shortest Direct Parent First (SDPF) where the <b>sinks</b> become the <b>agents,</b> e. g., the leaves of the agent tree. Finally, each source uses IRBOP for multicasting the stimulus data to the users over the agent tree. We evaluate the performance of DLATS through simulations. Results show DLATS outperforms previously proposed protocols for data dissemination in large-scale sensor networks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — With {{the advent}} of small {{form-factor}} devices, protocol standardization, and robust protocol implementations, multihop mobile networks are witnessing widespread deployment. The monitoring of such networks is crucial for their robust operation. To this end, this paper presents DAMON, a distributed system for monitoring multi-hop mobile networks. DAMON uses agents within the network to monitor network behavior and send collected measurements to data repositories. DAMON's generic architecture supports the monitoring {{of a wide range}} of protocol, device, and network parameters. Other key features of DAMON include seamless support for multiple repositories, auto-discovery of <b>sinks</b> by the <b>agents,</b> and resiliency of agents to repository failures. We have implemented DAMON agents that collect statistics on data traffic and the Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol. We have used our implementation to monitor an ad hoc network at the 58 th Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meeting held November 2003 in Minneapolis, MN.

Our network monitoring system is available online for use by other researchers. I...|$|R
40|$|Packet-switched {{communication}} networks such as today's Internet {{are built}} with several interconnected core and distribution packet forwarding routers and several sender and <b>sink</b> transport <b>agents.</b> In {{order to maintain}} stability and avoid congestion collapse in the network, the sources control their rate behavior and voluntarily adjust their sending rates to accommodate other sources in the network. In this thesis, we study one class of sender rate control that is modeled using continuous first-order differential equation of the sending rates. In order to adjust the rates appropriately, the network sends continuous packet-loss feedback to the sources. We study a form of closed-loop feedback congestion controllers whose rate adjustments exhibit a nonlinear form. There are three dimensions to our work in this thesis. First, we study the network optimization problem in which sources choose utilities to maximize their underlying throughput. Each sender maximizes its utility proportional to the throughput achieved. In our model, sources choose a utility function to define their level of satisfaction of the underlying resource usages. The objective of this direction is to establish the properties of source utility functions using inequality constrained bounded sets and study the functional forms of utilities against a chosen rate differential equation. Second, stability of the network and tolerance to perturbation are two essential factors that keep communication networks operational around the equilibrium point. Our objective {{in this part of}} the thesis is to analytically understand the existence of local asymptotic stability of delayed-feedback systems under homogeneous network delays. Third, we propose a novel tangential controller for a generic maximization function and study its properties using nonlinear optimization techniques. We develop the necessary theoretical background and the properties of our controller to prove that it is a better rate adaptation algorithm for logarithmic utilities compared to the well-studied proportional controllers. We establish the asymptotic local stability of our controller with upper bounds on the increase / decrease gain parameters...|$|R
40|$|Studying Nash {{dynamics}} is {{an important}} approach for analyzing the outcome of games with repeated selfish behavior of self-interested <b>agents.</b> <b>Sink</b> equilibria has been introduced by Goemans, Mirrokni, and Vetta for studying social cost on Nash dynamics over pure strategies in games. However, they do not address the complexity of sink equilibria in these games. Recently, Fabrikant and Papadimitriou initiated {{the study of the}} complexity of Nash dynamics in two classes of games. In order to completely understand the complexity of Nash dynamics in a variety of games, we study the following three questions for various games: (i) given a state in game, can we verify if this state is in a sink equilibrium or not? (ii) given an instance of a game, can we verify if there exists any sink equilibrium other than pure Nash equilibria? and (iii) given an instance of a game, can we verify if there exists a pure Nash equilibrium (i. e, a sink equilibrium with one state) ? In this paper, we almost answer all of the above questions for a variety of classes of games with succinct representation, including anonymous games, player-specific and weighted congestion games, valid-utility games, and two-sided market games. In particular, for most of these problems, we show that (i) it is PSPACE-complete to verify if a given state is in a sink equilibrium, (ii) it is NP-hard to verify if there exists a pure Nash equilibrium in the game or not, (iii) it is PSPACEcomplete to verify if there exists any sink equilibrium other than pure Nash equilibria. To solve these problems, we illustrate general techniques {{that could be used to}} answer similar questions in other classes of games...|$|R
