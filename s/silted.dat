5|$|The {{advent of}} iron {{ships in the}} late 19thcentury and the {{development}} of port facilities on the River Tees led to the decline of smaller Yorkshire harbours. The Monks-haven launched in 1871 was the last wooden ship built Whitby and a year later the harbour was <b>silted</b> up.|$|E
5|$|After the Restoration of Charles II, the pre-war {{owners of}} the {{property}} laid claim to Clifford's Tower, eventually being granted ownership. A garrison continued to be stationed there, however, which prevented the owners from actually occupying or using the property. Repairs {{were made to the}} tower, and it became a magazine for storing gunpowder and shot. Attempts were made to restore the condition of the moat, which had become badly <b>silted.</b> Some political prisoners continued to be held at the castle during the Restoration period, including George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends.|$|E
5|$|Several sites {{along the}} River Tone {{are set to}} undergo renovation. Firepool Weir lock— long <b>silted</b> up— will be dredged during 2011 to allow boats to pass from the navigable section of the Tone through Taunton to the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal. Goodland Gardens has {{received}} a makeover and a new cafe, The Shed, has opened. Projects to develop Somerset Square (the paved area next to the Brewhouse Theatre) and Longrun Meadow (country park near to SCAT) have already been delivered.|$|E

40|$|Water {{propagation}} and <b>silt</b> spreading over a silty seabed {{were studied}} and numerically analyzed. To this end, a multiphase flow model was employed {{based on the}} interMixingfoam Solver in OpenFOAM. The influence of different <b>silts</b> on water over a shoreline was investigated with different parameters such as <b>silt</b> viscosity, <b>silt</b> density, and inlet-water velocity. The developed numerical model was applied to general water <b>silt</b> interaction problems over a seabed; the main aspects studied were the water <b>silt</b> interaction and the corresponding water <b>silt</b> interface. The results showed that attenuation first increased, then decreased from soft to hard <b>silts.</b> Maximum attenuation was observed for <b>silt</b> 3 (i. e., some hard <b>silt).</b> Furthermore, the higher the inlet-water and inlet-silt speeds, the more the water and <b>silt</b> mixed. Consequently, the <b>silt</b> was uplifted. This model {{can also be used}} for the exploitation of low permeability reservoirs such as shale gas. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

5|$|The town is {{situated}} on the Isle of Thanet, a separate island from mainland Kent until around two hundred years ago, when the channel in between <b>silted</b> up. The geology of Thanet consists mainly of chalk, deposited when the area was below the sea. The Isle of Thanet was formed when the English Channel was formed by the sea breaking through, an island of chalk being left {{on the east side}} of the county. It was separated from the rest of Kent by the Wantsum Channel.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the fishing}} {{industry}} thrived in Christchurch, {{the importance of the}} harbour declined as it became inaccessible to vessels of a large draught. The harbour entrance was particularly troublesome with constantly shifting sandbars. In 1665 Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, bought the Lordship of the Manor of Christchurch. As part of his plans to improve trade in the town, he attempted to resolve the problems with the harbour entrance by cutting a new one through the sandspit at the foot of Hengistbury Head. However, upon completion the new entrance repeatedly <b>silted</b> up and in 1703 a large storm damaged a groyne which blocked the entrance entirely. Over the following 150 years alternative schemes were proposed but none were ever taken up.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} Diolkos at Corinth, there is scant {{literary}} evidence {{for two more}} ship trackways by that name in antiquity, both in Roman Egypt: The physician Oribasius (c. 320–400AD) records two passages from his 1st centuryAD colleague Xenocrates, in which the latter casually refers to a diolkos close to the harbor of Alexandria {{which may have been}} located at the southern tip of the island of Pharos. Another diolkos is mentioned by Ptolemy (90–168AD) in his book on geography (IV, 5, 10) as connecting a false mouth of a partly <b>silted</b> up Nile branch with the Mediterranean Sea. Neither Xenocrates nor Ptolemy offers any details on his trackway.|$|E
30|$|The {{generation}} of coarse <b>silt</b> with sand and mud clasts {{may have been}} explained by brecciation of slightly less dense but cohesive silt and sand and mixing of the brecciated clasts (sand and mud clasts) with less cohesive <b>silt</b> (<b>silt</b> slurry) created by seismic tremor. The rounded sand and mud clasts and the stretched sand and <b>silt</b> within the coarse <b>silt</b> portion imply that they were moved and sheared within <b>silt</b> slurry; fluidization occurred below the fine <b>silt.</b>|$|R
40|$|Erosion and {{sediment}} controls on construction sites minimize environmental impacts from sediment-laden stormwater runoff. <b>Silt</b> fence, a widely specified perimeter control practice on construction projects used to retain sediment on-site, has limited performance-based testing data. <b>Silt</b> fence failures and resultant sediment losses {{are often the}} result of structural failure. To better understand <b>silt</b> fence performance, researchers at the Auburn University-Erosion and Sediment Control Testing Facility (AU-ESCTF) have evaluated three <b>silt</b> fence options to determine possible shortcomings using standardized full-scale testing methods. These methods subject <b>silt</b> fence practices to simulated, in-field conditions typically experienced on-site without the variability of field testing or the limited application of small-scale testing. Three different <b>silt</b> fence practices were tested to evaluate performance, which included: (1) Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) Trenched <b>Silt</b> Fence, (2) ALDOT Sliced <b>Silt</b> Fence, and (3) Alabama Soil and Water Conservation Committee (AL-SWCC) Trenched <b>Silt</b> Fence. This study indicates that the structural performance of a <b>silt</b> fence perimeter control {{is the most important}} performance factor in retaining sediment. The sediment retention performance of these <b>silt</b> fence practices was 82. 7 %, 66. 9 % and 90. 5 %, respectively. When exposed to large impoundment conditions, both ALDOT Trench and Sliced <b>Silt</b> Fence practices failed structurally, while the AL-SWCC Trenched <b>Silt</b> Fence did not experience structural failure...|$|R

5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} barbican had been {{demolished}} {{to make way}} for houses and the moat had begun to be occupied with housing. By 1600 the moat was almost entirely <b>silted</b> up and houses had been built all {{around the edge of the}} bailey wall. In 1611 King James I sold Oxford Castle to Francis James and Robert Younglove, who in turn sold it to Christ Church College in 1613. The college then leased it to a number of local families over the coming years. By this time Oxford Castle was in a weakened state, with a large crack running down the side of the keep.|$|E
5|$|By the 7th century Reculver {{had become}} a landed estate of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Kent. The site of the Roman fort was given over for the {{establishment}} of a monastery dedicated to St Mary in 669AD, and King Eadberht II of Kent was buried there in the 760s. During the Middle Ages Reculver was a thriving township with a weekly market and a yearly fair, and it was a member of the Cinque Port of Sandwich. The settlement declined as the Wantsum Channel <b>silted</b> up, and coastal erosion claimed many buildings constructed on the soft sandy cliffs. The village was largely abandoned in the late 18th century, and most of the church was demolished in the early 19th century. Protecting the ruins and the rest of Reculver from erosion is an ongoing challenge.|$|E
5|$|Cardigan {{was one of}} {{the major}} ports of {{southern}} Wales until its harbour <b>silted</b> in the mid-19th century. The Industrial Revolution passed by, not much affecting the area. In the uplands, wheeled vehicles were rare in the 18th century, and horses and sleds were still being used for transport. On the coast, trade in herrings and corn took place across the Irish Sea. In the 19th century, many of the rural poor emigrated to the New World from Cardigan, between five and six thousand leaving the town between 1790 and 1860. Aberystwyth became the main centre for the export of lead and Aberaeron and Newquay did brisk coastal trade. The building of the railway from Shrewsbury in the 1860s encouraged visitors and hotels sprang up in the town to accommodate them.|$|E

5|$|Llanelli, Ammanford and {{the upper}} parts of the Gwendraeth Valley are {{situated}} on the South Wales Coalfield. The opencast mining activities in this region have now ceased but the old mining settlements with terraced housing remain, often centred on their nonconformist chapels. Kidwelly had a tin-plating industry in the eighteenth century, with Llanelli following not long after, {{so that by the}} end of the nineteenth century, Llanelli was the world-centre of the industry. There is little trace of these industrial activities today. Llanelli and Burry Port served at one time for the export of coal, but trade declined, as it did from the ports of Kidwelly and Carmarthen as their estuaries <b>silted</b> up. Country towns in the more agricultural part of the county still hold regular markets where livestock is traded.|$|E
5|$|South-west of {{the town}} is the Friar's Oven SSSI which {{is the site of}} herb-rich {{calcareous}} grassland classified as the Upright Brome (Bromus erectus) type, and north-east is the Windsor Hill Quarry geological SSSI, and also the Windsor Hill Marsh biological SSSI, a marshy <b>silted</b> pond with adjacent damp, slightly acidic grassland of interest for its diverse flora, in large part down to the varied habitats present within the small area. Two species are present which are rare in Somerset: Flat-sedge (Blysmus compressus) and Slender Spike-rush (Eleocharis uniglumis). Other marshland plants found there include Purple Loosestrife, Yellow Flag (Iris pseudacorus), Hard Rush (Juncus inflexus), Soft Rush (J. effusus), Flowering Rush (Butomus umbellatus), Devil's-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis), three species of Horsetail Equisetum spp. and seven sedges Carex spp.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{purchased}} from the Wollaston family in 1788 by Clement Winstanley. In 1790, {{the remains of}} the north tower were still standing, albeit in very poor condition. Clement Winstanley reportedly wanted to pull the northern ruins down, intending to reuse the bricks to make a barn, but his son, also called Clement, intervened, and subsequently carried out repairs to the castle. By the 19th century the ruins were covered in ivy; by the early 20th century, trees were growing out of the tops of the walls, which were frequented by grazing goats and cattle. Much of the moat had <b>silted</b> up and {{the remains of the}} bridge had been buried by the accumulated debris.|$|E
40|$|The physico-chemical {{properties}} and water regimes of loamy sand amended by adding <b>silt</b> loam were investigated under wheat (Triticum aestium L.) cultivation in field condition for two consecutive years. By mixing different {{proportions of the}} <b>silt</b> loam and loamy sand five soil treatments T 1 : loamy sand (0 % (by volume) <b>silt</b> loam) (control), T 2 : sandy loam (25 % <b>silt</b> loam), T 3 : loam 1 (50 % <b>silt</b> loam), T 4 : loam 2 (75 % <b>silt</b> loam), and T 5 : <b>silt</b> loam (100 % <b>silt</b> loam) were prepared. The experiments were set up in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD with 3 replications). The amendment (adding <b>silt</b> loam), by increasing organic matter and porosity; and altering the pore size distribution, improved soil structure that significantly (p = 0. 05) reduced hydraulic conductivity and elevated field capacity of loamy sand with a consequent increase in its water retention. The first small dose of <b>silt</b> loam (25 %) significantly elevated soil-water availability, the rate of which, however, decreased with further increase in amendment. The improved soil structure in the amended treatments (T 2 & T 4) significantly augmented irrigation efficiency by reducing irrigation requirement of wheat.

5|$|Tonnage {{had fallen}} from 246,000 tons in 1830 to 172,000 tons in 1840. It rose to 238,000 tons in 1850, then resumed its decline: 146,000 tons in 1860, 82,000 tons in 1870 and 24,000 tons in 1878. Until {{the end of the}} 19th century the {{municipality}} of Givors held that the canal was essential to development of the town, and that barge traffic was still a viable industry, fighting against closure of the canal and demanding that it remain navigable for its entire length despite mounting evidence that it was obsolete. However, by 1881, {{it was clear that the}} canal was in poor shape. The natural shores were eroded and the sides of locks 1–32 needed to be completely rebuilt. From locks 32 to 35 the canal was mostly <b>silted</b> up and in some places had disappeared completely, taken over by vegetable gardens.|$|E
5|$|Local {{interest}} in restoring the Middle Levels for navigation {{began to develop}} in 1949. The Fenlands Branch of the Inland Waterways Association was formed on 30 October 1949, and following assurances from the Ouse Catchment Board that they were planning to restore the river for navigation up to Bedford, the branch decided to devote their energies to the Middle Levels, which were weedy and heavily <b>silted.</b> Salters Lode lock was rebuilt in 1963, but passage along Well Creek was very difficult. The East Anglian Waterways Association and the Middle Level Watermans Club began campaigning {{for it to be}} dredged in 1964. The first major working party by volunteers on the system occurred in 1972, when the Well Creek Trust organised a project called 'Fenatic' in October, which involved draining the creek so that it could be cleared of rubbish. It was reopened for traffic in 1975.|$|E
30|$|The {{characteristics}} of this deformed bed (ca. 0.6  m thick) {{are similar to}} those described above except for the absence of strongly stretched sand and <b>silt</b> lens. This interval hosts two massive coarse <b>silt</b> parts and an interbedded massive sand part (Fig.  8 a). Both of the coarse <b>silt</b> parts have an indistinct basal boundary (Fig.  8 a). Numerous small rounded mud clasts are scattered in {{the upper part of the}} massive sand and in the overlying upper coarse <b>silt</b> (Fig.  8 b). The rounded sand clasts, which seem to have been originated from the underlying sand are contained in the upper coarse <b>silt</b> (Fig.  8 b). The boundary of the massive sand and the upper coarse <b>silt</b> shows flame-like shape in some part (Fig.  8 b), revealing both the parts were under the liquefied state when this boundary deformation occurred. The mud clasts in the massive sand are, therefore, interpreted to have been originated from the overlying massive coarse <b>silt.</b> The top of the upper coarse <b>silt</b> is then overlain by the fine <b>silt</b> and its boundary is undulated.

5|$|The River Don, which {{flows through}} Sheffield and Doncaster, had {{originally}} {{split into two}} channels below Stainforth, one of which emptied into the River Trent near Adlingfleet, close to its junction with the River Ouse, while the other headed north to join the River Aire near Rawcliffe. Following {{the work of the}} Dutch drainage engineer Cornelius Vermuyden to drain Hatfield Chase, the Adlingfleet outlet was closed off, and the channel to the River Aire, passing through Newbridge, was improved to take all of the flow. The scheme was not entirely successful, and after severe flooding near Sykehouse, Fishlake and Snaith, accompanied by riots, a new channel was cut between Newbridge and the River Ouse near what became Goole. The old course of the Don gradually <b>silted</b> up. Navigation on the Don was improved by the construction of cuts and locks, with the lowest lock situated at Stainforth. From there to the Ouse, boats used the Dutch River, Vermuyden's artificial drain, which was hazardous due to its fast flows, its tides and its shallowness at times.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{captured}} by Prince Louis of France who invaded England in 1216 {{at the invitation of}} the English barons who were disillusioned with King John. John Fitz-Robert became the governor of the royal castle under the young Henry III, followed by Hubert de Burgh. Under Edward I governorship of the castle was given to the de Valoines family, and it passed by marriage to Robert de Ufford, the 1st Earl of Suffolk, who was granted it in perpetuity by Edward III in 1336. No longer a royal castle, Orford was passed on through the Willoughby, Stanhope and Devereux families, whilst the surrounding economy of Orford went into decline. The estuary of the River Ore <b>silted</b> up and the Orford Ness spit increased, making the harbour access more difficult, resulting in a decline in trade, reducing the importance of the castle as the centre of local government.|$|E
5|$|The {{village is}} built beside four sandy bays; Minnis Bay to the west, Grenham Bay and Beresford Gap towards the centre and Epple Bay to the east. The village is {{situated}} on the Isle of Thanet, which was a separate island from mainland Kent until around two hundred years ago, when the channel in between became <b>silted</b> up. The area {{to the west of}} the village, between Birchington and Herne Bay, was once part of the channel and is now low-lying marshland. In the east of the village the land rises, forming chalk cliffs and cliff stacks around the beaches at Grenham Bay, Beresford Gap and Epple Bay. A sea wall stretches along the foot of the cliffs to prevent further erosion. The geology of Thanet consists mainly of chalk, deposited when the area was below the sea. Isle of Thanet became exposed above sea-level once the English Channel broke through between Kent and France, causing the sea-level to fall. The whole of the northeast Kent coast has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Turbine is {{the most}} {{important}} part of hydro power plant which converts the potential energy of water into mechanical energy. The presence of <b>silt</b> in water erodes the turbine material. Erosion of turbine decreases the performance of turbine, life of the turbine as well as loss of power generation. This paper presents a new approach for the study of <b>silt</b> erosion of hydro turbine. In this study, weight of eroded material of turbine have been determined by employing criterion of plastic strain which include parameters (<b>silt</b> size, <b>silt</b> hardness, concentration of <b>silt,</b> flow velocity, hardness of turbine material) affecting <b>silt</b> erosion of turbine. Results have been verified with experimental work for Pelton turbine having 16 buckets made up of brass material. It is seen that the results of analytical study matches with the experimental work.
