5|$|The ink <b>sac</b> of an octopus {{is located}} under the {{digestive}} gland. A gland {{attached to the}} <b>sac</b> produces the ink, and the <b>sac</b> stores it. The <b>sac</b> is {{close enough to the}} funnel for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a water jet. Before it leaves the funnel, the ink passes through glands which mix it with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in the ink is melanin, which gives it its black colour. Cirrate octopuses lack the ink <b>sac.</b>|$|E
5|$|Daniela Schwarz {{and colleagues}} (2007) {{concluded}} that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air <b>sac,</b> {{which would have been}} connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system. In Dicraeosaurus, this air <b>sac</b> (the so-called supravertebral diverticulum) would have rested on top of the neural arch and filled the entire space between the spines. In Amargasaurus the upper two-thirds of the spines would have been covered by a sheath of keratin, restricting the air <b>sac</b> to the space between the lower one-third of the spines.|$|E
5|$|Immature fruit {{bodies are}} spherical—somewhat {{resembling}} puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely {{buried in the}} ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner spore <b>sac.</b> The spore <b>sac</b> contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young is white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits {{around the perimeter of}} the spore <b>sac</b> so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer. Atop the spore <b>sac</b> is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has a small hole from which spores may be released.|$|E
25|$|Three {{distinct}} sets {{of organs}} perform respiration — the anterior air <b>sacs</b> (interclavicular, cervicals, and anterior thoracics), the lungs, and the posterior air <b>sacs</b> (posterior thoracics and abdominals). Typically {{there are nine}} air <b>sacs</b> within the system; however, that number can range between seven and twelve, depending on the species of bird. Passerines possess seven air <b>sacs,</b> as the clavicular air <b>sacs</b> may interconnect or be fused with the anterior thoracic <b>sacs.</b>|$|R

Here, we characterize six <b>SACs</b> found in the cells of two different tissues of a moderately mentally retarded male.

40|$|Air <b>sacs</b> are “sac-like {{extensions}} of the larynx or {{other parts of the}} vocal tract ” (Hewitt et al. 2000) There are many different types of air <b>sacs</b> in primates, but this poster focuses on air <b>sacs</b> that are connected to the vocal tract above the glottis. Such air <b>sacs</b> occur in many primates, including the great apes, but not in humans. Furthermore, fossil evidence (relating to the shape of the hyoid bone) indicates that Homo heidelbergensis (Martínez et al. 2008) did not have air <b>sacs,</b> whereas Australopithecus africanus (Alamseged et al. 2006) did. It is therefore tempting to seek a relation between air <b>sacs</b> and the evolution of speech. There is considerable uncertainty about the role of air <b>sacs.</b> Bioacousticians generally assume an acoustic role and write about “resonance”, “impedance matching”, “radiation ” (Gautier 1964, Hilloowala 1978, Schön Ybarra 1986). Other researchers propose functions not directly related to acoustics, such as rebreathing of air (Negus 1949) or prevention of hyperventilation (Hewitt et al. 2000) The situation is complicated by the lack of accurate acoustic models of air <b>sacs.</b> In the research presented here, a detailed model of supralaryngeal air <b>sacs</b> is constructed. Note that this research is intended as an exploration of the acoustic possibilities of air <b>sacs,</b> and that the intention is not at all to rule out potential other functions of air <b>sacs...</b>|$|R

5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak is performed {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast agent is injected into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura <b>sac</b> before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura <b>sac</b> in the imagery.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Investigated {{the effect}} of intraluminal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) on the {{intestinal}} mucosa {{in the presence of}} ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). METHODS: Six blind <b>sacs</b> of the small bowel (3 at the jejunum and 3 at the ileum) were created in ten Wistar rats. The lateral <b>sacs</b> of both bowel regions were subjected to IRI (15 / 15 minutes) while the medial <b>sacs</b> were let free to receive blood supply. In the lateral <b>sacs,</b> it was injected either a solution containing SCFA (butyrate, propionate and acetate) or pure saline at the bowel lumen. No fluid was injected in the medial <b>sacs.</b> RESULTS: Both at the jejunum and at the ileum the score of the mucosal injury was higher in saline than in control <b>sacs.</b> SCFA treated <b>sacs</b> showed lesser score at the ileum (p= 0. 03) but were not significantly different at the jejunum (p= 0. 83) when compared with saline <b>sacs.</b> It was found a significant greater number of neutrophils (p < 0. 01) in the <b>sacs</b> treated with saline than in the other two <b>sacs</b> in both regions.

50|$|In {{advanced}} sauropods ("neosauropods") the vertebrae of {{the lower}} back and hip regions show signs of air <b>sacs.</b> In early sauropods only the cervical (neck) vertebrae show these features. If the developmental sequence found in bird embryos is a guide, air <b>sacs</b> actually evolved before the channels in the skeleton that accommodate them in later forms.Evidence of air <b>sacs</b> has also been found in theropods. Studies indicate that fossils of coelurosaurs, ceratosaurs, and the theropods Coelophysis and Aerosteon exhibit evidence of air <b>sacs.</b> Coelophysis, from the late Triassic, {{is one of the}} earliest dinosaurs whose fossils show evidence of channels for air <b>sacs.</b> Aerosteon, a Late Cretaceous allosaur, had the most bird-like air <b>sacs</b> found so far.|$|R

5|$|Geastrum pectinatum {{has been}} mistaken for the morphologically similar but smaller species G.schmidelii. The latter species lacks {{vertical}} striations on the basal {{portions of the}} endoperidium, and {{does not have a}} pseudoparenchymatous collar around the stem. Another similar species, G.berkeleyi, has a shorter stem and is missing the ridges {{at the base of the}} spore <b>sac.</b> Further, the color of its spore <b>sac</b> is usually brown, in contrast to the gray-blue of G.pectinatum. G.xerophilum also has a dusting of white powder on the surface of the spore <b>sac,</b> but unlike G.pectinatum, consistently lacks a ring at the base of the pedicel; furthermore, in contrast to G.pectinatum, the spores of G.xerophilum are yellow and contain oil drops that are readily observable with a microscope. G.striatum has smaller fruit bodies than G.pectinatum, and a distinct collar-like apophysis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of the Berlin Blockade in June 1948, the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Hoyt S.

There are indications that seasonal climatic fluctuations {{may be responsible for}} embryo <b>sacs</b> developing abnormally or degenerating. Simple and multiple correlations confirmed that sexual embryo <b>sacs</b> usually do not develop abnormally or degenerate during the later developmental stages.

5|$|Anatomical dissections of two brown {{pelicans}} in 1939 {{showed that}} pelicans have {{a network of}} subcutaneous air <b>sacs</b> under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat, breast and undersides of the wings, as well as having air <b>sacs</b> in their bones. The air <b>sacs</b> {{are connected to the}} airways of the respiratory system, and the pelican can keep its air <b>sacs</b> inflated by closing its glottis, {{but it is not clear}} how air <b>sacs</b> are inflated. The air <b>sacs</b> serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water and may also cushion the impact of the pelican's body on the water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish. Superficial air <b>sacs</b> may also help to round body contours (especially over the abdomen where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position) to enable the overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics.|$|R
50|$|Ravens {{have a high}} {{metabolic}} rate that drives flight. Air flow is directed through the lungs via air <b>sacs.</b> The <b>sacs</b> are {{used to create a}} continuous unidirectional flow of fresh air over the respiratory surface. Most birds have nine air <b>sacs,</b> grouped into anterior and posterior <b>sacs,</b> but the common raven {{as a member of the}} Passeriformes group only has seven air <b>sacs</b> (missing two cervical air <b>sacs).</b> The common raven can be found in all parts of the globe. At higher altitudes and in warmer climates the oxygen concentration in the air is lower compared to low altitude or colder climate. Also, flight is a much more metabolically demanding movement then walking or running, and therefore we see a proportionally larger respiratory system in birds than in mammals.|$|R

40|$|Many {{microorganisms}} synthesize a {{wide range}} of surface active compounds (<b>SACs),</b> classified according to their molecular weights, properties and localizations. It low molecular weight <b>SACs</b> or biosurfactants lower the surface tension at the air/water interfaces and the interfacial tension at oil/water interfaces, whereas the high molecular weight <b>SACs,</b> also known as bioemulsifiers, are more effective in stabilizing oil-in-water emulsions. Th ability to biosynthesize <b>SACs</b> is, often, coupled with the ability of these microorganisms to grow on immiscible carbon sources, such as hydrocarbons. Different mechanisms are involved in the <b>SACs</b> interactions between microbial cells and immiscible hydrocarbons including: (i) emulsification, (ii) micellarization, (iii) adhesion-deadhesion of microorganisms to and from hydrocarbons and (iv) desorption of contaminants. Ttee naturally occurring phenomena can be exploited by adding bioemulsifiers and biosurfactants into environments where bioremediation/biodegradation rates of organic pollutants is to be enhanced. However, analysis of the current literature show some cases where the complex interactions among <b>SACs,</b> microbial cells, organic substrates and environmental media led to an inhibition of the biodegradation. 7 k understandin g of the different physiological roles of <b>SACs</b> in microbial communities is fundamental in order to develop more effective remediation technologies exploiting both synthetic surfactants and microbial <b>SACs.</b> Tiphysio-chemical properties of some microbial <b>SACs</b> have been exploited in hydrocarbon-contaminated soils washing and in mobilisation of soil-bound metal in metal-contaminated soils.

5|$|Abnormally {{developed}} milk caps infested by the parasitic <b>sac</b> fungus Hypomyces lateritius (syn. Peckialla laterita) are occasionally {{found in}} summer and autumn. The infested fruit bodies are usually more or less heavily malformed with a harder and more solid flesh than typical fruit bodies, {{so that they are}} more resistant to rot and can even survive the winter. They do not create gills; instead, the cap bottom is covered by an initially soft, white hyphen fungus, also known as a subiculum. Early on the mycelia becomes denser and takes on a white-grey colour. The perithecia are created after about 10–14 days. Perithecia are fruit bodies of the Hypomyces and other <b>sac</b> fungi, in which the spindle-shaped asci are produced. Besides L.deterrimus, L.deliciosus and L.sanguifluus can become infested, rarely other milk caps. Hypomyces lateritius, H.ochraceus, H.rosellus, H.odoratus, among other Hypomyces species live parasitically on different milk caps and brittlegills {{as well as on the}} fruit bodies of species from other genera.|$|E
