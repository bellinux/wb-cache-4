40|$|Abstract Most {{building}} projects neglect that despite minimizing the project duration, {{the uncertainty of}} constraints, such as the uncertainties of personnel, machine, or weather still jeopardizes the project <b>scheduling</b> <b>reliability</b> and influences the resources arrangement causing the project duration overrun. The contractor must combine the project scheduling with planning to reduce {{the uncertainty of the}} project activities and project duration. This study attempted to improve the relationship between activities, revise the uncertainty of activities, and reduce the uncertainty of schedule to enhance the reliability of building project scheduling by applying the concepts of Theory of Constraint (TOC). To demonstrate the effects on the reliability improvement in building project scheduling by the application of TOC, the authors take one high-rise building constructed in Taiwan as a case study to illustrate enhancement of <b>scheduling</b> <b>reliability.</b> The simulation results are compared to Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) simulation. The comparisons illustrate that the DBR proposed model can enhance the <b>reliability</b> of <b>schedule</b> planning...|$|R

50|$|Although buses can be {{designed}} any way regardless {{of the number of}} articulations, common bi-articulated bus designs resemble rail vehicle ones—in terms of how it operates—more than standard buses; in particular, considerations such as rapid passenger entry/exit (train type doors—usually elevated) vs. the traditional bus doors (with steps, including kneeling bus) often found on extra long traditional buses. By pushing payment issues (and their delays) to a BRT bus station, physically separating paid passengers by fare gates, and eliminating passenger or bus vertical movement to get on/off the bus, it frees the conductor from delays and complications. This increases throughput, speed, and <b>schedule</b> <b>reliability.</b> The trade-off is the cost of building bus stations vs. simply using a marking or pole to indicate where stops are.

On July 10, 1922, the Boston Elevated Railway opened a prepayment station at Lechmere. Typical of BERy projects, it was set up for efficient transfers between rapid transit and surface collector lines. A balloon loop with separate inbound and outbound platforms served terminating trains from the subway, with off-street streetcar boarding areas next to each. Surface cars could drop off passengers at the inbound platform off Cambridge Street, proceed under the elevated line, then board passengers at the outbound platform off Bridge Street. Connections between the surface and elevated tracks allowed cars to move between them if needed, and a small storage yard was located inside the balloon loop ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{more and}} more {{heterogeneous}} processor cores are embedded into a single chip. To deploy such heterogeneous embedded systems in critical applications, e. g., aircraft control, battleship missile launches, nuclear plant safe operations, etc., an important research problem is how to maximize system reliability while satisfying the required time constraint. Therefore, a scheduling scheme is needed to exploit the heterogeneity of a system and satisfy both the reliability requirement and the given time constraint. In this paper, we study the heterogeneous <b>reliability</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem, i. e., given a heterogeneous system, a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that models an application and a time constraint, find a schedule for the DAG so that the system reliability can be maximized and the time constraint can be met. To solve this problem, two heuristic algorithms, MCMS and PRMS, are proposed. The experimental results show that our algorithms can improve system reliability significantly. Among them, PRMS has the best performance and the improvement of reliability can be up to 30 %. KEY WORDS heterogeneous system, <b>scheduling,</b> <b>reliability...</b>|$|R

40|$|Despite {{claims by}} {{shipping}} lines {{that most of}} their containerships operate on fixed-day weekly schedules, a large survey recently revealed that over 40 % of the vessels deployed on worldwide liner services arrive one or more days behind schedule. Broadly speaking, the survey found relatively low average <b>schedule</b> <b>reliability</b> levels overall across the industry, but with strong variations between the schedules of different liner carriers and between different trade routes. Low <b>schedule</b> <b>reliability</b> {{can be caused by}} a number of factors, many of them beyond shipping lines ’ control, and can have serious consequences for various actors in the supply chain. This paper focuses on the impact of decreasing schedule integrity on one of these actors, namely shippers/consignees. More specifically, we present a case study to illustrate the impact of schedule unreliability on the level of safety stock that should be kept by a manufacturer who sources spare parts from overseas.

40|$|A {{critical}} problem {{faced by}} railways {{is how to}} increase capacity without investing heavily in infrastructure and impacting on <b>schedule</b> <b>reliability.</b> One way of increasing capacity {{is to reduce the}} buffer time added to timetables. Buffer time is used to reduce the impact of train delays on overall network reliability. While reducing buffer times can increase capacity, it also means that small delays to a single train can propagate quickly through the system causing knock-on delays to trains impacted by the delayed train. The Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) and Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) are researching a new approach for real-time train rescheduling that could enable buffer times to be reduced without impacting <b>schedule</b> <b>reliability.</b> This approach is {{based on the idea that}} if trains can be efficiently rescheduled to address delays, then less buffer time is needed to maintain the same level of system <b>schedule</b> <b>reliability.</b> The proposed approach combines a rescheduling algorithm with very accurate train operations (using a driver-machine interface).

40|$|Abstract—Thermal {{hot spots}} and high {{temperature}} gradients degrade reliability and performance, and increase cooling costs and leakage power. In this paper, we explore {{the benefits of}} temperature-aware task scheduling for multiprocessor system-on-a-chip (MPSoC). We evaluate our techniques using workload characteristics collected from a real system by Sun’s Continuous System Telemetry. We first solve the task scheduling problem statically using integer linear programming (ILP). The ILP solution is guaranteed to be optimal for the given assumptions for tasks. We formulate ILPs for minimizing energy, balancing energy, and reducing hot spots, and provide an extensive comparison of their thermal behavior against our technique. Our static solution can reduce the frequency of hot spots by 35 %, spatial gradients by 85 %, and thermal cycles by 61 % {{in comparison to the}} ILP for minimizing energy. We then design dynamic scheduling policies at the OS-level with negligible performance overhead. Our adaptive dynamic policy reduces the frequency of high-magnitude thermal cycles and spatial gradients by around 50 % and 90 %, respectively, in comparison to state-of-the-art schedulers. Reactive thermal management strategies, such as thread migration, can be combined with our scheduling policy to further reduce hot spots, temperature variations, and the associated performance cost.
