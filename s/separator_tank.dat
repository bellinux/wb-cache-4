An alternative {{to this type of}} coalescer is a flow through pre-coalescer that is installed upstream in a <b>separator</b> <b>tank.</b> In the Compact Electrostatic Coalescer. [...] droplet coalescence is achieved by applying AC electric fields (50-60 Hz) to water-in-oil emulsions under turbulent-flow conditions. The turbulence increases the collision frequency between the water drops. The electrodes are insulated to prevent short circuiting, and permits water contents of up to 40% as well as water slugs. The equipment is a separate flow-through electrostatic treatment section installed upstream of a gravity separator to improve the performance. By keeping the treatment and settling sections separate, a compact electrostatic coalescer can be obtained that can also be retrofitted.|$|E

The effect of flow rate (flow accelerated corrosion) on the surface of API 5 L X- 70 (steel use in this work) on the corrosion rate was evaluated and the corrosion products formed have been characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (EDX), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Linear Polarization technique (values of corrosion rate).

ECT yields low-accuracy images but is robust, inexpensive and much faster than many other tomography processes. This non-intrusive method essentially measures non-conductive system distributions and is applied in oil industry processes such as mixing or stirring vessels, fluidized bed reactors, <b>separator</b> <b>tanks</b> and pipelines carrying multiphase flows. A forward problem is solved at each step of an iterative algorithm to solve the inverse problem using simulated annealing (SA). Comparisons with linear methods like The Projected Landweber technique are discussed. In this paper we introduce a finite volume discretization with local mesh refinements in a cylindrical configuration close to the electrodes {{in order to improve}} resolution in the calculation of capacitances, and to avoid problems with resolution at the centre of cylindrical container when finite differences are used. This discretization has the advantage of a conservative formulation as used in finite element methods and features the flexibility of mesh refinement close to the electrodes. Thus, improvement of local accuracy is achieved without increasing prohibitively the number of mesh points. Performance of the forward problem resolution is compared with finite element based methods and experimental data. We show that the non linear version of SA provides better reconstructions of three-phase flows than the Landweber method...|$|R
40|$|Based upon {{experimental}} data for heavy oil-water flow inside steel (26. 7 mm ID) and cemented (23. 9 mm ID) horizontal tubes, {{a very simple}} model for pressure drop in the core annular flow pattern was developed. The experiments were run at room temperature and the fluids used were a fuel oil (μ = 2. 7 Pa. s, ρ = 989 kg/m 3) and tap water, both drawn from a <b>separator</b> <b>tank.</b> First, it is shown that for both tubes the so-called 'perfect core annular flow' approach (shortly PCAF) poorly correlates the data. This {{is due to the}} waviness of the interface and turbulence in the annulus flow. These effects are taken into account in the model proposed in this paper and justify the assumption of no-slip, which was earlier concluded by the author from wavespeed measurements for the same flow (Bannwart, 1998). As a result, a very simple correlation model for the pressure gradient is derived. The model was adjusted to fit the data and generalized to other tube sizes and fluids. Different correlations for oleophilic and oleophobic pipe walls are provided. Calculations using the correlation for oleophobic pipe behavior are in very good agreement with data from another source...|$|E

Moreover the EU is going toward a �green� energy system which not allows the usage of fossil-fuel based technologies.

40|$|Although {{the design}} life {{of many of}} the oil and gas (O&G) {{production}} and process facilities on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) has been exceeded, the same physical assets are still under exploitation as a result of extended life based on the information gathered by inspection, maintenance, modification and replacement history. Nevertheless, pressure systems, which comprised of static mechanical equipment such as piping components (valves, <b>separators,</b> <b>tanks,</b> vessels, spools, etc.), undergo continuous inherent deterioration (fatigue, corrosion, erosion, etc). Often the deterioration rates vary over the lifetime following no specific pattern due to the changes in product quality of the well stream, varying environmental conditions and unexpected cyclical loading. These necessitate effective inspection planning to repair, modify or replace those components that reach the end of their design life. This enables the integrity of the physical assets to be retained at a tolerable level. The inspection planning has traditionally been driven by prescriptive industry practices and carried out by human experts, based on risk-based inspection (RBI) and risk-based maintenance (RBM) philosophies. The RBI and RBM involve the planning of inspections {{on the basis of the}} information obtained from risk analyses of a particular system and related equipment.

They were a modification of the cyclotrons he had invented and used in his Noble Prize winning investigations of the atomic nucleus. At the time their construction was undertaken, calutrons represented the only certain means of preparing enriched uranium isotopes {{for the construction of}} a fission bomb. The effort was successful enough that every atom of the 42 kg of 235 U used in the first uranium bomb had passed through at least one stage of calutron separation. At peak production, the first stage <b>separators,</b> α <b>tanks,</b> yielded an aggregate 258 -g/d 235 U enriched to about 10 at. % from its natural abundance level of 0. 72 at. %.

Under typical operating conditions, each α tank operated at a uranium beam intensity at the collectors of approximately 20 mA and each β tank at a beam intensity of approximately 215 mA at the collectors.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the efficiency of vanadium removal from the effluent collected in the <b>separator</b> <b>tank</b> of Shazand Arak Refinery via the absorbent of modified multi-walled carbon nanotube. Methods: This in vitro study {{was conducted on the}} oil effluent via the Batch method with concentrations of 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 ppm, respectively. The effects of such variables as absorbent amount, initial concentration of vanadium solution, pH, temperature and contact time were assessed on the efficiency of vanadium removal by the absorbent. In order to improve the absorbent’s performance, oxidation process was utilized via nitric acid. Moreover, IR spectra as well as SEM images of absorbent were prepared, and the data were matched with isotherms of the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin. Results: The results of the current study showed that the efficiency of vanadium removal from oil effluent by the absorbent reached 99 % at 20 °C during 130 min, with adsorbent amount of 0 / 03 g and the optimum pH of 5. In addition, absorption equilibrium of the absorbent was consistent with the Freundlich isotherm (R 2 = 0 / 995).

40|$|In {{the mining}} industry, {{ferromagnetic}} particles (e. g. magnetite) are concentrated using wet low-intensity magnetic separation (LIMS). Mineral particles in suspension with water are {{pumped into the}} <b>separator</b> <b>tank,</b> and a magnetic concentrate is extracted by use of magnetic forces. The performance of the process is {{to a large extent}} controlled by the internal flow conditions in the separator, governed by process and machine settings. Due to the machine design these settings are not independent, and in some cases {{it can be difficult to}} reach optimal process performance. The main purpose of this work has been to find a measurement method capable of monitoring internal material transport in the wet LIMS, and use these data, together with numerical flow modelling, to get an increased understanding about the separation process. Since the mineral slurry entering the separator is essentially opaque, and the solids concentration is rather high, an ultrasound-based method was selected for the internal measurements. It is of interest to monitor both the internal flow patterns, as well as material build-up resulting from the magnetic field. The method development and evaluation proceeded in steps with increasing complexity, with later stages building on experience from the former. Initial measurements were done in model systems with simple geometries, and over a range of flow velocities corresponding to flow velocities in full-scale magnetic separators. Additional measurements were done on model systems under influence of a magnetic field of varying strength. After the measurement methods were verified in controlled laboratory conditions they were evaluated in real world conditions; in situ at the LKAB pilot plant in Malmberget, Sweden. For the pilot scale experiments a setup with two ultrasound transducers, mounted at the bottom of the <b>separator</b> <b>tank,</b> was used. The factors included in the designed experiment were the feed solids concentration, drum rotational speed, position of the concentrate weir, and the magnet assembly angle. Based on this investigation the drum rotational speed was the factor having the strongest influence on the overall flow velocity in the dewatering zone. Also, the presence of a recirculating flow transporting gangue particles away from the concentrate was confirmed. The factor with strongest influence on this flow is also the drum rotational speed, together with the magnet assembly angle. Using this method it is possible make high quality measurements of internal flow velocity profiles. It is also possible to monitor material build-up on the separator drum, and e. g. detect overload of magnetic material. The ultrasound based measurement system resulting from this work measures particle velocity based on a cross-correlation principle. Two consecutive ultrasound pulse-echo signals are cross-correlated piece-wise, to obtain a local velocity estimate. By measuring the suspension flow from two directions, using two transducers, 2 D velocity vectors can be estimated. Using the same measured data, but instead studying how the spectral contents of the signal vary with axial distance from the transducer, a qualitative measure of variations in local solids concentration can be obtained. During this work several aspects of wet LIMS have been studied, with focus on the internal material transport processes inside the separators. State-of-the-art measurement methods have been utilized to monitor the material flow inside the separators. Particle capture and entrainment have been studied on the particle level using numerical flow modelling. Measurement results have been linked to operational conditions of the separators. The insights gained, and the methods developed, have generated new possibilities to control, optimise, and develop the wet LIMS process.

Asphaltene can self-associate and/or precipitate, but the self-association and precipitation is mediated by other solubility fractions particularly resins (Speight 1999).

40|$|For {{distillation}} column design {{it is necessary}} to define all the variable parameters such as component concentrations in different streams temperatures, pressures, mass and energy flow, which are used to represent the separation process of some specific system. They are related to each other according to specific laws, and if the number of such parameters exceeds the number of their relationships, in order to solve a problem some of them must be specified in advance or some constraints assumed for the mass balance, the balance of energy, phase equilibria or chemical equilibria. Knowledge of specific elements which are the constituents of a distillation unit must be known to define the number of design parameters as well as some additional apparati also necessary to realize the distilation. Each separate apparatus might be designed and constructed only if all the necessary and variable parameters for such a unit are defined. This is the right route to solve a distilation unit in many different cases. The construction of some distillation unit requires very good knowledge of mass, heat and momentum transfer phenomena. Moreover, the designer needs to know which kind of apparatus will be used in the distillation unit to realize a specific production process. The most complicated apparatus in a rectification unit is the {{distillation column}}. Depending on the complexity of the separation process one, two or more columns are often used. Additional equipment are heat exchangers (reboilers, condensers, cooling systems, heaters), <b>separators,</b> <b>tanks</b> for reflux distribution, tanks and pumps for feed transportation, etc. Such equipment is connected by pipes and valves, and for the normal operation of a distillation unit other instruments for measuring the flow rate, temperature and pressure are also required. Problems which might arise during the determination and selection of such apparati and their number requires knowledge of the specific systems which must be separated.

40|$|Man, {{with his}} {{presence}} {{and the use}} of space, has been changing the Earth's surface and the functioning of the entire biotope. Due to the growing urbanization, drainage coefficients have increased and the possibility of rain water retention on the surface has decreased. Among other things, large interventions in nature are also caused by the construction of motorways. We often deal with a great amount of rainwater coming very quickly from the road surface during heavy rain, which is often quite contaminated and as such unsuitable for release into the natural environment. Therefore, the rainwater from the road surface must first be properly cleaned before discharge, as determined by the applicable law. The type and degree of purification are determined according to the vulnerability of the area where the traffic route runs. Due to the lack of sufficient drainage, it is often necessary to hold rainwater in reservoirs, where water is partially cleaned and slowly released into the environment.

It specific developmental functions include: (1) Test fuel cells and fuel cell components under repeated closed-cycle operation (nothing escapes; everything is used over and over again). (2) Simulate diurnal charge-discharge cycles (3) Observe long-term system performance and identify degradation and loss mechanisms. (4) Develop safe and convenient operation and control strategies leading to the successful development of mission-capable, flight-weight RFC's...|$|R
40|$|There are {{approximately}} 36, 000 glycol dehydration {{systems in the}} natural gas production sector emitting an estimated 15 Bcf of methane per year into the atmosphere. Most dehydration systems use triethylene glycol (TEG) as the absorbent fluid to remove water from natural gas. As TEG absorbs water, it also absorbs methane, other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). As TEG is regenerated through heating in a reboiler, absorbed methane, VOCs, and HAPs are vented to the atmosphere with the water, wasting gas and money. The amount of methane absorbed and vented is directly proportional to the TEG circulation rate. Many wells produce gas far below the original design capacity but continue to circulate TEG at rates {{two or three times}} higher than necessary, resulting in little improvement in gas moisture quality but much higher methane emissions and fuel use. Reducing circulation rates reduces methane emissions at negligible cost. Installing flash <b>tank</b> <b>separators</b> on glycol dehydrators further reduces methane, VOC, and HAP emissions and saves even more money. Recovered gas can be recycled to the compressor suction and/or used as a fuel for the TEG reboiler and compressor engine. Economic analyses show flash <b>tank</b> <b>separators</b> installed on dehydration units payback costs in 4 to 11 months. Technology Background Many producers use triethylene glycol (TEG) in dehydrators to remove water from the natural gas stream and to meet pipeline quality standards. In a typical TEG system, shown in Exhibit 1, “lean ” (dry) TEG is pumped to the gas contactor. In the contactor, the TEG absorbs water, methane, VOCs, and HAPs (including benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylenes (BTEX)), from the wet production gas. The “rich ” (wet) TEG leaves the contactor saturated with gas a...|$|R
40|$|A centripetal-force-based liquid/gas {{separator}} {{has been}} proposed {{as a means of}} reducing the loss of liquid during venting of the ullage of a tank in microgravity as a new supply of liquid is pumped into the <b>tank.</b> Centripetal-force-based liquid/gas <b>separators</b> are used on Earth, where mechanical drives (e. g., pumps and spinners) are used to impart flow speeds sufficient to generate centripetal forces large enough to effect separation of liquids from gases. For the proposed application, the separator would be designed so {{that there would be no}} need for such a pump because the tank-pressure-induced outflow speed during venting of the ullage would be sufficient for centripetal separation. A relatively small pump would be used, not for separation, but for returning the liquid recovered by the <b>separator</b> to the <b>tank...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{heavy ion}} superconducting {{synchrotron}} Nuclotron intended to accelerate nuclei and multicharged ions with q/A = {{up to an}} energy of 6 Gev/u was put into operation in the Laboratory of High Energies of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna, Russia) in 1993. The Nuclotron cryogenic supply is based on three helium refrigerators of 1600 W capacity at 4. 5 K each which cools the accelerator ring with a “cold ” mass of about 80 tons. Cryogenic system parameters control is described in this paper. The measured and controlled parameters are cryogenic temperatures, turboexpanders speed of rotation, mass and levels of liquid nitrogen and helium in the <b>separators</b> and storage <b>tanks,</b> nitrogen and helium pressures, helium flow rates. Home industry carbon and platinum sensors are used for temperature measurements at ranges of (4. 5 – 300) K and (20 – 300) K respectively. The electromagnetic sensors we use for rotation speed registration of small size turbine expanders and manometers for pressure measurements. The helium flow rates are measured by the thermosensitive quartz resonators with a temperature sensitivity of 2 mK at 300 K. The hardware interface is in CAMAC and PC standard...|$|R
40|$|Background: A new {{biological}} {{domestic wastewater}} treatment process, {{which has been}} presented these days in activated sludge modification, is Upflow Sludge Blanket Filtration (USBF). This process is aerobic and acts by using a sludge blanket in the <b>separator</b> of sedimentation <b>tank.</b> All biological flocs and suspended solids, which are presented in the aeration basin, pas through this blanket. The performance of a single stage USBF process for treatment of domestic wastewater was studied in laboratory scale. Methods: The pilot of USBF has been made from fiberglass and the main electromechanical equipments consisted of an air com­pressor, a mixing device and two pumps for sludge return and wastewater injection. The wastewater samples used for the experiments were prepared synthetically to have qualitative characteristics similar to a typical domestic wastewater (COD= 277 mg/l, BOD 5 = 250 mg/l and TSS= 1 mg/l). Results: On the average, the treatment system was capable to remove 82. 2 % of the BOD 5 and 85. 7 % of COD in 6 h hydraulic re­tention time (HRT). At 2 h HRT BOD and COD removal efficiencies dramatically reduced to 50 % and 46. 5 %, respectively. Conclusion: Even by increasing the concentrations of pollutants to as high as 50 %, the removal rates of all pollutants were re­mained similar to the HRT of 6 h...|$|R
