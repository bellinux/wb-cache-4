40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} differences between nurses and paraprofessionals in {{implementation of a}} home visiting program for low-income, first-time parents during pregnancy and the first 2 years of the child's life. METHODS: Mothers {{were randomly assigned to}} either a nurse-visited (n = 236) or a paraprofessional-visited (n = 244) condition. Nurse- and paraprofessional-visited families were compared on number and length of visits, topics covered, number of program dropouts, and relationship with home visitor. RESULTS: On average, nurses completed more visits than paraprofessionals (28 vs 23; P <. 001) and <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> proportion of time on physical health issues during pregnancy (38 % vs 27 %; P <. 001) and on parenting issues during infancy (46 % vs 32 %; P <. 001).

Six 30 -acre cool-season grass pastures, bisected by a stream, were split into two blocks with three treatments per block.

40|$|Shared intentionality, or {{the ability}} of people to focus on an event of {{interest}} is an important developmental process that has been studied extensively in hearing children (Bakeman 2 ̆ 6 Adamson, 2004) and children with ASD (Mundy, 1995). However, {{only a handful of}} studies exist that document shared intentionality in deaf children of hearing parents, a population which is subject to decreased performance on socio-cognitive measures of development compared to hearing children of hearing parents. The present study hypothesized that Hd dyads would have shorter mean lengths of interaction than Hh dyads, that group differences in proportion of time <b>spent</b> in <b>a</b> state would exist only in the unengaged and coordinated joint engagement states, and that Hh dyads would demonstrate age-typical patterns of engagement state production while Hd would show delays.

Haakon accepted the proposal (although {{he did not think}} it would change much politically), but the marriage between Haakon and Margrete did not take place before 1225, partly due to the conflict with Ribbung. The relationship between Haakon and Skule nevertheless deteriorated further during the 1230s, and attempts of settlements at meetings in 1233 and 1236 only distanced them more from each other. Periodically, the two nonetheless reconciled and <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> amount of time together, only to have their friendship destroyed, according to the saga by intrigues derived from rumours and slander by men who played the two against each other. Skule was the first person ever in Norway to be titled Duke (hertug) in 1237, but instead of control over a region gained the rights to the incomes from a third of the syssels scattered across the whole of Norway. This was part of an attempt by Haakon to limit Skule's power. In 1239 the conflict between the two erupted into open warfare when Skule had himself proclaimed king. Although he had some support in Trøndelag, Opplandene and in eastern Viken, he could not stand up to Haakon's forces. The rebellion ended when Skule was killed in 1240, leaving Haakon the undisputed king of Norway. This revolt is generally taken to mark the final end of Norway's civil war era.|$|E
5|$|The provincial presidents were {{appointed}} by the national government and were, in theory, charged with governing the province. In practice, however, their power was intangible, varying from province to province based upon each president's relative degree of personal influence and personal character. Since the national government wanted to ensure their loyalty, presidents were, in most cases, sent to a province {{in which they had}} no political, familial or other ties.

As the president usually <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of time away from the province, often traveling to their native province or the imperial capital, the de facto governor was the vice-president, who was chosen by the Provincial Assembly and was usually a local politician. With little power to undermine provincial autonomy, the president was an agent of the central government with little function beyond conveying its interests to the provincial political bosses. Presidents could be used by the national government to influence, or even rig, elections, although to be effective the president had to rely on provincial and local politicians who belonged to his own political party. This interdependency created a complex relationship which was based upon exchanges of favors, private interests, party goals, negotiations, and other political maneuvering.|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate which environmental cues were used by sheep when discriminating against patches of pasture contaminated with faeces. The influence of the spatial distribution of contaminated patches and the parasite infection status of sheep on avoidance of contaminated patches and ingestion of parasite larvae was also investigated. In experiment 1, sheep infected with the parasite Ostertagia circumcincta were {{given the opportunity to}} graze in uncontaminated or aggregated contaminated patches. Patch contamination comprised of either faeces from sheep infected with O. circumcincta larvae, faeces from uninfected sheep, or O. circumcincta larvae only. Infected sheep discriminated against faeces from parasite-infected animals and faeces from uninfected animals equally. Sheep did not discriminate against patches contaminated with parasite larvae only. In experiment 2, sheep infected with O. circumcincta and uninfected sheep grazed experimental plots with differing spatial patterns of faecal-contaminated patches, allowing animals the opportunity to forage in contaminated or uncontaminated patches of herbage. Plots were also grazed by infected and uninfected animals that were fistulated at the oesophagus to enable the collection of ingested herbage.

40|$|Abstract Background Research {{indicates}} {{that in the}} United States, children experience healthier BMI and fitness levels during school vs. summer, but research is limited. The primary goal of this pilot study was to assess where children spend their time during the months that school is not in session and {{to learn about the}} different types of activities they engage in within different care settings. A secondary goal of this pilot study was to learn what children eat during the summer months. Methods A nine-week summer study of 57 parents of second and third grade students was conducted in an economically, racial/ethnically and linguistically diverse US urban city. Weekly telephone interviews queried time and activities spent on/in 1) the main caregiver's care 2) someone else's care 3) vacation 4) and camp. Activities were categorised as sedentary, light, moderate, or vigorous (0 - 3 scale). For each child, a mean activity level was calculated and weighted for proportion of time spent in each care situation, yielding a weighted activity index. On the last phone call, parents answered questions about their child's diet over the summer. Two post-study focus groups were conducted to help interpret findings from the weekly activity interviews. Results The mean activity index was 1. 05 ± 0. 32 and differed between gender (p = 0. 07), education (p = 0. 08) and primary language spoken in the household (p = 0. 01). Children who <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> percentage of time in parent care had on average a lower activity index (β = - 0. 004, p = 0. 01) while children who <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> percentage of time in camp had a higher activity index (β = 0. 004, p = 0. 03).

40|$|Background : Previous {{research}} indicates that children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) present difficulties in forward modeling and online control. Most of these studies emphasize speeded discrete movements, but controlling movements online is imperative for movement sequences of longer duration such as control necessary in handwriting. Aim: To examine online planning in children with DCD during a handwriting task. It was hypothesized that children with DCD would present more difficulty adjusting {{to a change in}} an ongoing handwriting task, as evidenced by decreased fluency, longer duration of strokes, and greater percentage of time before peak velocity in the stroke immediately after a perturbation. Additionally, it was hypothesized that children with DCD would exhibit greater difficulty when more complex control is required, as shown by decreased fluency, longer stroke duration, and greater percentage of time after peak velocity when performing simple and complex sequences of loops and peaks. Method : Eleven children with DCD (10 y 1. 34 years) and 11 typically developing children (10 y 1. 34 years) performed continuous (loops) and discontinuous (peaks) movement sequences in which complexity was varied (a series of shapes of the same height or of a combination of heights). On some trials children had to increase the size of the loops on cue. Kinematic analysis of movement sequences was performed using NeuroScript and a digitizing tablet. Results: Children with DCD were more dysfluent and spent more time to peak velocity than the TD but adjusting to the tone by changing their plan online was not different. Discontinuous tasks (peaks) required <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> control from DCD and the TD group, with the simple sequence being the only that captured differences in strategies used to control the movement. Children with DCD spent equal time in the upstroke and downstroke, compared with TD who spent more time in the downstroke. Additionally, children with DCD <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> percent of time into peak velocity in contrast with the TD group, who <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> percentage after peak velocity. Conclusion : Children with DCD present different strategies to control their movements that may interfere with their ability to plan online.
