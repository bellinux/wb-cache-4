5|$|During {{the last}} years of his life, apart from his devotion to the Sagrada Família, Gaudí participated only in minor {{projects}} which were not completed: in 1916, on the death of his friend bishop Josep Torras i Bages, he designed a monument in his honour, which he wanted to place in front of the Passion facade of the Sagrada Família. He made a <b>sketch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project, which ultimately was not carried out, and made a plaster bust of the bishop, the work of Joan Matamala under the instruction of Gaudí. It was put in the Sagrada Família, where it would have formed part of the church, but it was destroyed in 1936. Another commemorative monument project, also not carried out, was dedicated to Enric Prat de la Riba, which would have been situated in Castellterçol, birthplace of this Catalan politician. The project dates from 1918, and would have consisted of a tall tower with two porticos and a spire topped with an iron structure flying the Catalan flag. The <b>sketch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project was done by Lluís Bonet i Garí, Gaudí's assistant.|$|E

5|$|Family {{and family}} history also plays an {{important}} role in the poem. Eliot found information on his family from <b>Sketch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eliot Family, which described how Eliot's family lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he disrupted the family history. Similarly, Eliot broke from his own family when he travelled away from his family, a family that he saw was declining. Within the poem, Eliot emphasizes the need for a journey and the need for inward change.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, American {{cartoonist}} Charles Burns authored X'ed Out, {{a graphic}} novel {{with a variety}} of allusions to The Adventures of Tintin. In one scene, the protagonist Nitnit discovers a warehouse containing white eggs with red spots, akin to the mushrooms in The Shooting Star, with the cover of Burns' book paying homage to Hergé. In 2015, the original front cover <b>sketch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book was sold for €2.5million to a European investor, Marina David of Petits Papiers-Huberty-Breyne, at the Brussels Antiques and Fine Art Fair.|$|E
5|$|John H. Flood Jr., Wyatt Earp's secretary, who he {{regarded}} like a son, drew a <b>sketch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gunfight at the O.K. Corral in 1926 under Wyatt's supervision.

It was sold at auction by Alexander Autographs in early October 2010, for $380,000.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with the}} third edition, Darwin prefaced the {{introduction}} with a <b>sketch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical development of evolutionary ideas. In that sketch he acknowledged that Patrick Matthew had, unknown to Wallace or himself, anticipated the concept of natural selection in an appendix to a book published in 1831; in the fourth edition he mentioned that William Charles Wells had done so as early as 1813.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding out}} that Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) was flashed in the parking lot, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens an investigation. He orders Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to {{interview}} Phyllis and make a <b>sketch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flasher. However, Phyllis says she didn't {{get a good look}} at him, so Pam instead draws a picture of Dwight with a mustache and without glasses. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) assists (who also seems to notice that the sketch looks similar to Dwight) an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with Pam's sketch on it around town.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} {{as college}} president in 1886, Thompson remained active in school, party, and church affairs. He became {{a director of}} the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society in 1885 and prepared their exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. He wrote several books on church topics, including Our Bishops: A <b>Sketch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Origin and Growth of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, published in 1889. In 1901, he was elected editor of the United Brethren Review. He died in Dayton, Ohio on July 8, 1920, and was buried at Westerville, Ohio's Otterbein Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{the many}} {{literary}} sources, Eliot also draws {{on his personal}} feelings and experience, especially on the great stress that he felt while composing the poem. Similarly, Eliot used the image of pilgrims coming to America and the stories of them that were common throughout his childhood. In particular, his mother wrote poems about the pilgrims arriving in New England, and Eliot found information related to his family's history in a book called <b>Sketch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eliot Family. The location, East Coker, was where Andrew Eliott, T. S. Eliot's ancestor, left when joining the pilgrimage.|$|E
5|$|Corentin and Madame du Gua, foils to {{the happy}} couple, plot and scheme {{endlessly}} {{to bring about}} the misery and downfall of those who will not love them. Du Gua is at first a sympathetic character, {{but by the end of}} the novel she is presented as sharing a face with a spirit from hell. She represents revenge and hatred chiseled from romantic injury, and has been noted as a rough <b>sketch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> title character in Balzac's La Cousine Bette. Corentin, meanwhile, stands in contrast to Montauran's romantic nature as much as to Hulot's military prowess. Rebuffed by Marie and unable to wield the might of the commandant, Corentin relies on trickery and deception to achieve his ruthless ends.|$|E
5|$|Geographers in the Roman Empire such as Ptolemy {{provided}} a rough <b>sketch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern Indian Ocean, including the Malay Peninsula and beyond this the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea. Ptolemy's Cattigara {{was most likely}} Óc Eo, Vietnam, where Antonine-era Roman items have been found. Ancient Chinese geographers demonstrated a general knowledge of West Asia and Rome's eastern provinces. The 7th-century AD Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta wrote of the contemporary reunification of northern and southern China, which he treated as separate nations recently at war. This mirrors both the conquest of Chen by Emperor Wen of Sui (reigned 581–604 AD) {{as well as the}} names Cathay and Mangi used by later medieval Europeans in China during the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and Han-Chinese Southern Song dynasty.|$|E
