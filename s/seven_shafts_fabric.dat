During construction illegal drinking houses were built and riots occurred in navvies' temporary accommodation near the tunnel's northern mouth.|$|R
50|$|Ground {{was first}} broken on 23 April 1900 to drill the Grimberg shaft at Widdershausen, {{and the first}} Wintershall potash works were built in Heringen. Wintershall drilled other shafts in the Werra potash fields, and built or {{acquired}} other works in the region. From 1895 to 1913, <b>seven</b> potash <b>shafts</b> were drilled in Hessen and 21 in Thuringia in the Werra valley.|$|R
50|$|Four stone {{courses of}} the eastern spring of the arch, {{consisting}} of a row of impost blocks and three layers of voussoirs, have survived to modern times. This remnant was first identified in 1838 by Biblical scholar Edward Robinson and now bears his name. At that time, prior to any excavations, remains of the arch were at ground level. The ancient street level lay far underground, buried by debris from destruction of structures on the Temple Mount and later fill dumped into the Tyropoeon Valley over the centuries. Robinson believed he had identified {{the eastern edge of}} a bridge that linked the Temple Compound with the Upper City which lay on the ridge to the west.During his investigations of 1867-1870, Charles Warren noted the presence of a large pier 13 m west of the wall and the remains of the arch. Warren concluded this was but one of many supports for a supposed series of arches supporting a bridge spanning the valley. He subsequently dug a series of <b>seven</b> <b>shafts</b> to the west at regular intervals, yet found no evidence of additional piers.|$|R
50|$|The East Side tunnel was {{the largest}} sewer {{construction}} project ever undertaken by the City of Portland. A contractor, Kiewit-Bilfinger Berger (KBB), used a tunnel boring machine that was 300 ft long and had a cutting head that was 25 ft in diameter. In addition to the tunnel and the pipe, the project involved building <b>seven</b> access <b>shafts,</b> connecting pipelines, and the Portsmouth Forcemain, which carries sewage from the Swan Island Pump Station to the Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant.|$|R
5000|$|Inside the church, {{three steps}} lead {{up from the}} nave to the chancel, the risers of which bear an inscription. At {{the top of the}} steps is a low stone wall surmounted by a brass rail. A further three steps, also with risers baring inscriptions, lead up to the altar. The {{sanctuary}} has a mosaic floor. [...] On the south side of the sanctuary is a sedilia and a piscina. In the south wall of the chancel is a priest's door, and in the north wall a door leads into the vestry. [...] The circular pulpit is carried on <b>seven</b> <b>shafts.</b> The stone font is cup-shaped on a cruciform base. [...] The stained glass in the east window is by Kempe, and depicts a crucifix with Saint Mary, Saint John, Saint Oswald, and Saint Werburgh. In the north transept is a memorial window to Baron William Henry Schroder of nearby Rookery Hall. This was made by Morris & Co. and depicts the Good Shepherd and Saint Hubert. In the south transept are windows with depictions of Noah, Abraham, David, and Daniel. The glass in the west window includes images of Hannah with Samuel, and Saint Elizabeth. [...] The two-manual organ stands on the north wall of the chancel.|$|R
5000|$|The mighty {{king of the}} Kalingas, Srutayush, {{accompanied}} by a large army advanced towards Bhima’s car. The ruler of the Kalingas with many thousands of cars, supported by Ketumat, {{the son of the}} king of the Nishadas, with 10000 elephants and the Nishada army, surrounded Bhimasena, on all sides. Then the Chedis, the Matsyas, and Karushas, with Bhimasena at their head, with many kings impetuously rushed against the Nishadas. Terrific was the collision that took place between the few and many, between the Chedis on the one side and the Kalingas and the Nishadas on the other. The Chedis, abandoning Bhima, turned back. But Bhima, encountering all the Kalingas, did not turn back. Bhima, staying on his car whose steeds had been slain, hurled at Sakradeva, the son of the Kalinga King Srutayush, a mace made of the hardest iron. And slain by that mace, the son of the ruler of the Kalingas, from his car, fell down on the ground, with his standard and charioteer. Later he slew Bhanumat, the prince of Kalingas, by ascending the back of his elephant and cutting his body in half, with sword. Bhima drawing his bow slew the ruler of the Kalingas, Srutayush, with <b>seven</b> <b>shafts</b> made wholly of iron. And with two shafts he slew the two protectors of the car-wheels of the Kalinga King. And he also dispatched Satyadeva and Satya. (6,54) ...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{adenovirus}} (Ad) as {{an efficient}} and versatile vector for in vivo tumor therapy requires the modulation of its cellular tropism. We previously developed {{a method to}} genetically alter the tropism of Ad 5 fibers by replacing the fiber knob domain by an extrinsic trimerization motif and a new cellular ligand. However, fibers carrying complex ligands such as single-chain antibody fragments did not assemble into functional pentons in vitro {{in the presence of}} penton base, and failed to be rescued into infectious virions because of their inability to fold correctly within the cytoplasm of Ad-infected cells. Here we show that the coding sequence for a disulfide bond-independent three-helix bundle scaffold Z, derived from domain B of Staphylococcal protein A and capable of binding to the Fc portion of immunoglobulin (Ig) G 1, could be incorporated into modified knobless Ad fiber gene constructs with <b>seven</b> <b>shaft</b> repeats. These fiber gene constructs could be rescued into viable virions that were demonstrated to enter 293 cells engineered for IgG Fc surface expression but not unmodified 293 cells, via a mechanism that could be specifically blocked with soluble Fc target protein. However, the tropism modified viruses showed a slightly impaired cellular entry and a lower infectivity than wildtype (WT) virus. In addition, we generated recombinant fibers containing an IgA binding Affibody ligand, derived from combinatorial specificity-engineering of the Z domain scaffold. Such fiber constructs also showed the expected target specific binding, indicating that the affibody protein class is ideally suited for genetic engineering of Ad tropism...|$|R
40|$|Kalahroud Cave {{is located}} in central Iran, ~ 50 km north of Isfahan. The {{landscape}} is a typical mountain desert morphology of cuestas dissected by ravines and gorges created during rare surface run-off events; crest lines are ~ 2800 m asl and lowlands at ~ 2100 m asl. Kalahroud Cave (4500 m of mapped passages, ~ 60 m deep) is entered through breakdown in the eastern wall of a gorge. The host rock is a Cretaceous limestone and mudstone formation 60 m in thickness, underlain by sandstones and conglomerates and overlain by weakly permeable calcareous marl strata, all dipping 15 - 20 o. Below the entrance breakdown, two corrosion notch chambers give access to a rectilinear, quasi-horizontal maze of joint-guided passages extending ~ 500 m eastwards. Rock solution morphology created by slowly flowing phreatic waters predominates (solution pockets, partitions, paragenetic forms, etc). <b>Seven</b> <b>shafts</b> are known that discharged water into the maze and chambers from inaccessible passages below. From XRD analysis, the paragenetic sediments derive from the mudstone interbeds. There are small displays of frostwork, helictites and thin flowstones typical of vadose speleothem deposition in arid caves. Below {{the level of the}} corrosion notch, more complex sub-aqueous and shelfstone calcites are overlain by accumulations of calcite rafts up to 70 cm in depth. Raft deposition continues today. It is proposed that the cave is of hypogene origin, serving to discharge interformational groundwaters into the gorge, and becoming de-watered as the latter was deepened. The corrosion notches are due to cessation of deepening. From U series dating, the modern phase of raft deposition began about 10, 000 years ago. The sequence and ages of older events will be investigated in future work...|$|R

5000|$|Blea Moor Tunnel is a 2,629 yd (2,404 m) {{railway tunnel}} located between Ribblehead Viaduct and Dent railway station in England. It {{is the longest}} tunnel on the Settle-Carlisle Line, being almost {{twice as long as}} the second longest tunnel, Rise Hill Tunnel. Built by the Midland Railway, it took more than four years to complete, passes some 500 feet below the moor after which it was named, and was built with the aid of <b>seven</b> {{separate}} construction <b>shafts</b> sunk from the moor above. This permitted sixteen separate gangs of workers to be used during construction (one from each open end and two from the foot of each of the shafts). [...] Four of these were subsequently filled in but three were retained for ventilation purposes and are still used as such today (with occasional ice accumulation problems: http://railwayeye.blogspot.com/2010/01/ice-to-see-you-to-see-you-ice.html). At one point of the track's history, steam locomotives were tested for their worthiness by driving them through this tunnel.|$|R
5000|$|The 1120 yd long tunnel, up to {{six feet}} wide and four feet high, had ten {{ventilation}} shafts each up to 3 yd wide and up to 49 yd deep. Driven from Bottling Wood to Park Pit, work started in 1653 and finished in 1670. The miners used picks, hammers, wedges and spades and would have encountered blackdamp which would have extinguished their candles warning them of its presence. The sough was completed without using explosives {{but it is possible}} that fires were lit against the rock {{at the end of a}} shift to help break it. The shafts were used to remove rock as the miners cut the tunnel. Progress averaged 66 yd per year or about 4 ft a week. Between its outlet and Park Pit the sough passed through several layers of hard sandstones, mudstones and the Cannel and King Coal seams. <b>Seven</b> ventilation <b>shafts,</b> roughly aligned with the main drive to Haigh Hall, were worked as small collieries and the rest filled in. The first shaft from the outfall, Cannel Hollows Pit, was 23 ft deep. The fifth shaft, Sandy Beds Pit, was sunk 30 yd to the sough and met the coal seam at 14 yd. Its shaft was rectangular in section but the others were round. The last shaft before Park Pit was 48 yd deep to the sough and met the Cannel seam at 32 yd. The shaft at Park Pit was 46 yd to the sough and met the King Coal seam at 41 yd.|$|R
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) do {{not express}} the coxsackie-adenovirus (Ad) receptor and are poorly permissive to Ad serotype 5 (Ad 5). Genetically modified, coxsackie-Ad receptor-independent Ad 5 vectors were studied for gene delivery in human RA FLS and synovium explants and murine collagen-induced arthritis. Short-fiber Ad 5 vectors with <b>seven</b> fiber <b>shaft</b> repeats Ad 5 GFP-R 7 -knob, Ad 5 GFP-R 7 -arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) (RGD-liganded), and Ad 5 GFPDeltaknob (knob-deleted) {{were compared with}} Ad 5 GFP-FiWT, a conventional wild-type (WT) Ad 5 vector. Gene transfer by Ad 5 GFP-R 7 -knob and Ad 5 GFP-R 7 -RGD was 40 - to 50 -fold and 25 -fold higher, respectively, than Ad 5 GFP-FiWT in FLS. Ad 5 GFPDeltaknob was more efficacious than its knob-bearing version Ad 5 GFP-R 7 -knob in FLS transduction. Virus attachment and entry required RGD- and LDV-binding integrins including alpha(v), alpha(v) beta 3, a(v) beta 5, and beta 1. Ad 5 GFP-R 7 -knob infection of FLS was partially neutralized by synovial fluid (SF), but remained 30 - to 40 -fold higher than Ad 5 GFP-FiWT {{in the presence of}} SF. Ad 5 GFPDeltaknob was partially neutralized by SF at low virus input, but escaped viral neutralization by SF at higher virus input. Gene transfer to human synovium ex vivo explants and murine collagen-induced arthritis in vivo was also more efficient with short fiber-modified vectors (with and without the knob domain) than Ad 5 GFPFiWT. Gene transfer by short fiber-modified vectors was enhanced by inflammatory cytokines in vitro and in the presence of inflammation in murine synovium in vivo. Our data indicated that the highly efficient gene delivery RA was mediated by RGD- and non-RGD-binding integrins and enhanced by inflammation. Short fiber modifications with knob ablation may be a strategy to enhance gene delivery, reducing vector dose and vector-induced inflammation and toxicity...|$|R
40|$|To {{ascertain}} the possible roles of Schwann cells in nerve regeneration, morphological changes of these cells at the proximal stump of the transected mouse sciatic nerve was examined. One or 2 days after transection, an extensive degradation of myelin sheath occurred near the cut {{end of the}} proximal stump. Schwann cells in this region contained variously-sized myelin balls in the cytoplasm. Three to five days after transection, Schwann cells in the proximal stump exhibited several sections of rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum and welldeveloped Golgi complexes in an abundant cytoplasm. Mitotic figures were often observed in these cells. In the mini-neuromas formed at the distal tip of the proximal stump, Schwann cells extended thin cytoplasmic processes along the regenerating growth cones and axonal <b>shafts.</b> <b>Seven</b> or ten days after transection, each Scwann cell encircled 1 or 2 thick axons with their thin cytoplasmic processes, and remyelination occurred in these axons. However, thin axons remained free from these processes, and some exhibited degenerative changes. After 14 and 21 days, regenerating axons gradually decreased in number, and each thick axon was encircled by its own myelin sheath of several layers. These findings suggest that Schwann cells at the proximal stump might be involved in several important events for nerve regeneration such as demyelination, trophic support, control of the extension and maturation of regenerating axons...|$|R
40|$|Monolayers of cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) -deficient human tracheal glandular cells (CF-KM 4) {{were subjected to}} phage biopanning, and cell-internalized phages were isolated and sequenced, {{in order to identify}} CF-KM 4 -specific peptide ligands that would confer upon adenovirus type 5 (Ad 5) vector a novel cell target specificity and/or higher efficiency of gene delivery into airway cells of patients with {{cystic fibrosis}} (CF). Three different ligands, corresponding to prototypes of the most represented families of phagotopes recovered from intracellular phages, were designed and individually inserted into Ad 5 -green fluorescent protein (GFP) (AdGFP) vectors at the extremities of short fiber <b>shafts</b> (<b>seven</b> repeats [R 7]) terminated by scissile knobs. Only one vector, carrying the decapeptide GHPRQMSHVY (abbreviated as QM 10), showed an enhanced gene transduction of CF-KM 4 cells compared to control nonliganded vector with fibers of the same length (AdGFP-R 7 -knob). The enhancement in gene transfer efficiency was not specific to CF-KM 4 cells but was observed in other mammalian cell lines tested. The QM 10 -liganded vector was referred to as AdGFP-QM 10 -knob in its knobbed version and as AdGFP-QM 10 in its proteolytically deknobbed version. AdGFP-QM 10 was found to transduce cells with a higher efficiency than its knob-bearing version, AdGFP-QM 10 -knob. Consistent with this, competition experiments indicated that the presence of knob domains was not an absolute requirement for cell attachment of the QM 10 -liganded vector and that the knobless AdGFP-QM 10 used alternative cell-binding domains on its capsid, including penton base capsomer, via a site(s) different from its RGD motifs. The QM 10 -mediated effect on gene transduction seemed to take place at the step of endocytosis in both quantitative and qualitative manners. Virions of AdGFP-QM 10 were endocytosed in higher numbers than virions of the control vector and were directed to a compartment different from the early endosomes targeted by members of species C Ad. AdGFP-QM 10 was found to accumulate in late endosomal and low-pH compartments, suggesting that QM 10 acted as an endocytic ligand of the lysosomal pathway. These results validated the concept of detargeting and retargeting Ad vectors via our deknobbing system and redirecting Ad vectors to an alternative endocytic pathway via a peptide ligand inserted in the fiber shaft domain...|$|R
