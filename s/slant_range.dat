25|$|The first GL set was a crude design {{developed}} during the 1930s. Based on Chain Home, GL used separate transmitters and receivers located in wooden cabins mounted on gun carriages, {{each with its own}} large antenna that had to be rotated to point at the target. The antenna produced a signal that was semi-directional and was only capable of providing accurate <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> information; it could not locate a target better than about 20 degrees in bearing, and did not provide elevation information at all. A number were deployed with the British Expeditionary Force and at least one was captured by German forces during the Dunkirk evacuation. Their evaluation led them to hold a low opinion of British radar systems.|$|E
25|$|The AMMO shot {{took place}} on 1 July 1958, {{successfully}} intercepting a simulated 650 knot target flying {{at an altitude of}} 100,000 feet and a <b>slant</b> <b>range</b> of 79 miles. The first SNODGRASS round was launched on 14 July with its warhead replaced by an instrument package and launched against a 350-knot Q2A Ryan Firebee I drone. A similar test on 17 July against a 300-knot Q2A destroyed the target with the T45. A dual-launch followed on 24 July, with the first round destroying its target with the T45, and the second with the instrument package flying one second behind. A similar test on 29 July launched two missiles against three F-80 Shooting Star drones flying in formation, the first missile destroyed the lead aircraft while the second passed within lethal range of a second. Testing was unexpectedly cancelled before the W-7 could be fired.|$|E
500|$|Although the A-10 {{can carry}} {{considerable}} disposable stores, its primary built-in weapon is the 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger autocannon. One {{of the most}} powerful aircraft cannons ever flown, it fires large depleted uranium armor-piercing shells. The GAU-8 is a hydraulically driven seven-barrel Gatling-type cannon designed specifically for the anti-tank role with a high rate of fire. The cannon's original design could be switched by the pilot to 2,100 or 4,200 rounds per minute; this was later changed to a fixed rate of 3,900 rounds per minute. The cannon takes about half a second to come up to speed, so 50 rounds are fired during the first second, 65 or 70 rounds per second thereafter. The gun is accurate enough to place 80 percent of its shots within a 40-foot (12.4 m) diameter circle from 4,000 feet (1,220 m) while in flight.

500|$|Due to {{the wide}} pattern of the {{transmission}} antenna, some of the signal always hit the ground, reflecting some of it back at the aircraft to cause a ground return. This was so powerful that it was received {{on all of the}} antennas, even the upper vertical receiver which would otherwise be hidden from signals below it. As the shortest distance, and thus the strongest signal, was received from reflections directly below the aircraft, this caused a strong blip to appear across all the displays at the range of the fighter's altitude. The ground further in front of the aircraft also caused returns, but these were increasingly distant (see <b>slant</b> <b>range)</b> and only some of the signal was reflected back at the aircraft while an increasing portion was scattered forward and away. Ground returns at further distances were thus smaller, resulting in a roughly triangular series of lines at the top or right side of the displays, known as the [...] "Christmas tree effect", beyond which {{it was not possible to}} see targets.|$|E

After that, bulk range cell migration correction (RCMC) and second range compression (SRC) are carried out to compensate the high-order RCM and range compression terms. Following that, an azimuth ellipse model is constructed to reveal the azimuth-variant characteristic of BiSAR.
