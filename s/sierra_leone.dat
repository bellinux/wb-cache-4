The team {{is governed by}} the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> Football Association and {{is part of the}} Confederation of African Football. <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> has played only four FIFA recognised matches, two in 1994 and two in 2010. The country has under-17 and under-20 women's national sides. The development of women's football in <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> faces challenges present throughout the continent. Domestically, it faces its own issues including the lack of a women's domestic competition and the decline in popularity of the sport among women.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> has a <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> women's {{national}} under-17 football team. They {{were supposed}} {{to compete in the}} African Women U-17 Championship Qualifying Tournament 2010. Togo won the first round because <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> withdrew from the competition.

5|$|After a hotel {{housing the}} {{remaining}} foreign nationals was attacked, Penfold organised a further evacuation, which {{was conducted by}} an American warship. The ship transported the evacuees—including Penfold—to Conakry in neighbouring Guinea. While in Conakry, Penfold advised Kabbah on re-establishing his government in exile, and leased a disused restaurant for the government's headquarters. Kabbah was restored in February 1998, but {{the role of the}} private military company Sandline International in assisting Kabbah created controversy in the United Kingdom, as its services were alleged to violate an arms embargo on <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone.</b> After an HM Customs investigation, a parliamentary inquiry, and a select committee investigation, Penfold was reprimanded but allowed to return to his post. Later in the year, violence began to intensify again in <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone,</b> and Penfold was ordered to evacuate foreign nationals (the eight evacuation of his career and the second in <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone)</b> over Christmas 1998. He requested an extension to his term as high commissioner, but the request was denied and he left <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> in April 2000. He spent {{the last year of his}} career working for the Department for International Development and retired in 2001. In retirement, Penfold has spoken on issues concerning Africa, particularly <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone,</b> and has been critical of the FCO. His support of Kabbah, and his role in returning him to power in 1998, earned Penfold folk hero status in <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone.</b>|$|E

5|$|The last STTT, {{formed around}} 2nd Battalion, The Light Infantry, left <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> {{at the end}} of September 2001. Approximately 8,500 SLA {{personnel}} were trained by the STTTs, which were replaced by the International Military Assistance and Training Team (IMATT)—an organisation formed of personnel from countries including Australia, Canada, and the United States, with the UK providing the largest contingent as well as an infantry company for force protection. The STTTs also formed a small special forces unit within the SLA—the Force Reconnaissance Unit (FRU)—to provide a morale boost and to give soldiers something to which they could aspire. Later in 2001, the British Army advised the Sierra Leonean government on a merger of Sierra Leone's armed forces into a unified command, which became the Republic of <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> Armed Forces in early 2002. In 2008, the permanent British contingent in <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> was reduced to 100 personnel. British soldiers remained in <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> as of 2013, continuing to form part of the IMATT, whose size has further reduced in accordance with the increased capabilities of the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> armed forces.|$|E

5|$|The {{capture of}} the Royal Irish patrol {{reinforced}} to the British government that its efforts so far—and those of the international community—would {{not be sufficient to}} bring the civil war to an end. In Westminster, meanwhile, opposition politicians renewed their objection to the continued presence of British forces in <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone.</b> The government was seeking an exit strategy that would end a politically unpopular deployment without abandoning <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} was eventually ended by the Lomé Peace Accord, which {{was signed in}} July 1999. The United Nations Observer Mission to <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> was replaced with the United Nations Mission in <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> (UNAMSIL), which included a force of 260 military observers. The observers were unarmed and tasked with monitoring the ceasefire mandated by the Lomé Agreement. The observer force, like UNAMSIL itself, was primarily made up of personnel from other African nations, but the United Kingdom contributed {{a small number of}} officers from the British Army, Royal Marines, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. In addition to the observers in <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone,</b> personnel from the Royal Logistic Corps were serving in New York, assisting UNAMSIL with organising air-lifts to bring the mission up to its authorised strength.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1998, the RUF {{began to}} re-mobilise in {{northern}} <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone.</b> As tensions escalated, the FCO ordered an evacuation of British citizens just before Christmas. Penfold believed the evacuation—the eighth of his career—was unnecessary and argued against it; his objections were over-ruled and {{he was ordered to}} evacuate his staff, though he was allowed to remain in Freetown with his military protection detail. The Royal Air Force evacuated approximately 35 people, but many British people chose to stay. Penfold travelled to Abidjan after Christmas for an international summit on <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone,</b> but the FCO refused to allow him to return to <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone,</b> so he again based himself in a hotel in Conakry. The RUF attacked Freetown on 6 January 1999. After 10 days of fighting, the rebels were pushed back and Penfold was transported back to <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> by a British warship. He flew to Freetown for daily meetings with Kabbah, but was not allowed to move back into his residence and so temporarily lived on the ship. Later in 1999, the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> government entered into negotiations which resulted in the Lomé Peace Agreement. Penfold opposed power-sharing with the RUF, and believed he was excluded from the talks in Lomé because of his views. The agreement did not hold, and violence again broke out in early 2000.|$|E

5|$|After the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> Civil War {{began in}} 1991, the CDC closed their program in Segbwema. Conteh and his medical team moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), {{where he spent}} the next two decades running the only {{dedicated}} Lassa fever ward in the world. Conteh collaborated with the British charity Merlin to promote public health in <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone</b> through education and awareness campaigns intended to prevent Lassa fever. With little funding and few supplies, Conteh successfully reduced mortality rates and saved many lives until an accidental needlestick injury led to his own death from the disease in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} the posting as drugs adviser, Penfold was keen {{to go back to}} Africa. He applied for a post as high {{commissioner}} in Namibia, but the post was downgraded and the application fell through. Penfold was then offered a posting to <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone.</b> Although it was a lower-ranking post than the British Virgin Islands, Penfold was assured that taking the position would not adversely affect his career, so he accepted and, in March 1997, was appointed High Commissioner to <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone.</b> He later stated that he believed his previous experience in Africa, particularly in Uganda, stood him in good stead for the events of his posting to <b>Sierra</b> <b>Leone.</b> The country {{was in the middle of}} a bloody civil war in 1997, and on 25 May—six weeks into Penfold's tenure—President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's government was overthrown in a military coup. Although the coup itself did not come as a surprise, the timing caught the international community off-guard. As in Uganda a decade earlier, Penfold gathered all the high commission staff and their families under one roof.|$|E
