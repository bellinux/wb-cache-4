Adams, who was 21 years old at the time, has stated that he brought his bass drum to that first game because he wanted to add to the noise of [...] "seat banging", a {{tradition}} at Cleveland Stadium in which fans would bang the <b>swivel</b> <b>seat</b> of their chairs against the chair's base during tense moments in the game. But Adams preferred to sit in the bleachers, where there were no seats to bang.|$|E

50|$|When the {{swivel chair}} is {{installed}} in an aircraft, an automobile or on a stair lift {{and can not}} move independently because it is on a fixed base, it is rather called a <b>swivel</b> <b>seat.</b> Some swivel seats are also bucket seats.|$|E
50|$|Stair lifts {{are highly}} {{individualized}} units that vary in price significantly. However, many base units begin between $3,000 and $5,000. Many options affect this base pricing including: length of railing needed, any curves involved, seat upgrades, motor upgrades, seat <b>swivel,</b> <b>seat</b> and foot pedal folding, and power type.|$|E
50|$|In 1955 a {{very narrow}} one-man {{miniature}} electric car was developed and installed so policemen could patrol {{the full length of}} the tunnel from the catwalk {{on the side of the}} tunnel instead of having to walk it. By use of a <b>swivel</b> <b>seat</b> the policemen could drive the car in either direction.|$|E
5000|$|The 1959 {{model year}} saw the Hemi engines {{replaced}} by Chrysler's new Golden Lion wedge-head V8 at 413 CID L displacement (which Chrysler called [...] "lion-hearted").

50|$|The Sukhoi Shkval was {{designed}} as a two-engined interceptor with radar, two built-in aircraft guns and side-by-side afterburner engines. Two designs were investigated in the wind tunnel. These differed only {{in the form of the}} air intakes and the position of the canards. The first version with D-shaped air intakes, comparable to the Su-15, and canards in front of the cockpit, which extend to the radome, could not get through. The second concept with rectangular ramp air inlets (comparable to the air inlets of the MiG-25) and canards at the upper side edge of the air inlets got the advantage. The hull itself is similar to the fuselage of the Su-15 without landing gear, wing, fin and brake flaps. The four wings were fixed at the corners of the fuselage as a reclining X (comparable to the fictional X-wing fighter from Star Wars). On the four wings end were cylindrical containers, which in the lower part contain shock absorbers for take-off and landing. In the remaining part of these cylindrical containers were kerosene tanks, as in wings and the fuselage. The containers were externally provided with a guide plate as a continuation of the wing. Each wing has a rudder that functions as a rudder and aileron. In order to facilitate the vertical landing, the entire Ejection seat as well as the Thrust lever and the Side-stick were pivotally mounted in the cockpit in such a way that the ratio of the ejection seat to these control elements remained unchanged regardless of the pivoting position. The swivel device gave the pilot a better view of the ground / landing zone by a window in the cockpit floor. A cockpit section of the Sukhoi Shkval was built with the window in the ground and the <b>swivel</b> <b>seat</b> / instrument combination, with which this function could be tested and demonstrated, which happened several times. A two-axle trailer was also planned for the transport and erection of the Sukhoi Shkval.|$|E
40|$|Kayakers have {{traditionally}} used a fixed seat but in 2005 a “swivel seat”, able to rotate in the horizontal plane, was approved {{for use in}} races. While anecdotal evidence {{has suggested that the}} <b>swivel</b> <b>seat</b> may improve performance, the available data are limited and mainly physiological. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of the <b>swivel</b> <b>seat</b> on kinematics and trunk muscle activation during paddling on ergometer. Nine experienced kayakers volunteered for this study and each completed two maximal trials of 30 s on the ergometer, one with the <b>swivel</b> <b>seat</b> and the other with a fixed seat. Three-dimensional motion analysis and performance data were collected at 200 Hz during the central 10 s of each trial. Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded at 2000 Hz bilaterally from the rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, latissimus dorsi and the erector spinae muscles. The use of the <b>swivel</b> <b>seat</b> was observed to improve performance through a significant increase in peak flywheel RPM (p = 0. 033), right paddle recovery time (p = 0. 043) and paddle antero-posterior displacement (p = 0. 015). Shoulder rotation increased when using the <b>swivel</b> <b>seat</b> but trunk rotation decreased significantly (p = 0. 019). In addition, EMG analysis suggested greater activation of the trunk muscles during the <b>swivel</b> <b>seat</b> condition, where body position was closer to the recommended upright orientation and the knee range of motion was increased (p < 0. 01) ...|$|E
50|$|Most <b>swivel</b> <b>seats</b> have {{a safety}} switch so the {{stairlift}} won’t move unless the seat is locked into its travel position.

5000|$|A {{backhoe loader}} is a tractor-like vehicle with a backhoe at one end, a front loader {{on the other}} and a <b>swivelling</b> <b>seat</b> to {{position}} the operator facing whichever he is using at the time. In North America, this arrangement {{is often referred to}} as simply a backhoe or, when on a chassis originally derived from farm tractors, a tractor loader backhoe (TLB). To differentiate, a backhoe on its own dedicated chassis may then be referred to as an [...] "excavator".|$|R
5000|$|In 1981, for {{mainland}} European market only, the Transit Clubmobil {{was introduced}} by the Hymer company.

5000|$|A {{specialised}} {{air ambulance}} {{model of the}} Sycamore was developed during the early 1950s. In this configuration, up to two patients were internally-stowed on stretchers stacked {{one over the other}} in the cabin; this was contrary to the conventional arrangement of the era of using externally-mounted [...] "pods" [...] in which to carry patients instead. To provide the extra width necessary to accommodate this arrangement, detachable Perspex blisters are fitted {{on each side of the}} cabin. The stretcher racks could be folded into the sides of the cabin, providing room for up to three sitting casualties instead; a purpose-built electrical point is also provided for powering electric blankets. Adjacent to the pilot is a <b>swivelling</b> <b>seat</b> intended for a medical attendant.|$|R
5000|$|There two {{trailers}} {{have provided}} {{part of the}} mainline running fleet {{for many years and}} rarely exited service, except for routine maintenance. However, in 1999 trailer 56 was removed from service and has since been converted into the line's only disabled access saloon featuring removable <b>swivel</b> <b>seating,</b> hydraulic wheelchair ramps and accommodation for carers; at this time the car was also fitted with a public address system for use with winter saloon No. 22 for commentary guided trips of the line. Although bearing little resemblance to its original configuration the trailer was painted into traditional [...] "house" [...] colours of red and cream and sees limited service on the line subject to demand. Prior to is conversion there was no provision for disabled passengers on the railway.|$|R

40|$|Well-designed {{university}} {{buildings and}} physical environments have a documented {{positive impact on}} student participation, engagement, and feelings of support and belonging. These factors are known to improve learning; however, {{it is hard to}} document the direct impact architecture has on student learning outcomes. Information on how specific design choices impact student learning would be tremendously beneficial to the development of new projects, and outcome data from prior remodeling projects could be used to inform the myriad choices architects and universities must make for new designs. This paper compares two different designs of remodeled, large lecture-theater designs: one with traditional tiered rows and one with <b>swivel</b> <b>seating</b> to facilitate face-to-face discussions during lectures and the impact these designs had on student learning. Both high- and low-performing students appear to have benefited from the swivel-seat discussions {{by the end of the}} semester, with potentially a larger benefit for stronger students...|$|R
5000|$|The third {{intermediate}} car offers elevated comfort First Class seating, {{the others}} Standard Class. [...] <b>Swivelling</b> <b>seats,</b> {{which can be}} rotated around at terminal stations so that they always face {{in the direction of}} travel, are installed in both classes, rather than only in First Class as on the KTX-I. [...] Compared to the KTX-I, seat distance was increased from 930 to 980 mm to provide more leg room. [...] The fourth passenger car houses a snack bar and family compartments with separated facing seats. [...] Other passenger comfort features include wireless internet access and digital multimedia broadcasts, and business compartments with small tables. [...] Like on the KTX-I, all passenger compartments are equipped with ceiling-mounted video displays, but 19" [...] LCD screens are used instead of 17" [...] ones. [...] Unlike those of the KTX-I, the KTX-II passenger compartments were fitted with fire detectors. [...] Toilet doors were automatised, and the toilet in the first passenger car is suited for disabled persons.|$|R
50|$|The vehicle {{had many}} car safety-related {{features}}, novel at the time, some now routine. These features included seatbelts, a roll cage, a padded instrument panel, side-impact bars, and a collapsible steering column. The {{placement of the}} spare tire under the front end served to absorb impacts. The most innovative safety feature, {{which has not been}} incorporated into other cars, was the ability to <b>swivel</b> the <b>seats</b> to face rearwards should a collision seem imminent.|$|R

50|$|The bomb bay of the B-47B {{was shorter}} {{than that of}} the XB-47 and B-47A, since nuclear weapons had shrunk in the interim. However, the B-47B could carry a much larger bombload, of up to 18000 lb. All B-47Bs carried the tail turret with twin 20 mm (0.79 in) guns and the B-4 radar-guided FCS (Fire Control System). The B-4 FCS proved troublesome, and in some B-47Bs, it was {{replaced}} with an N-6 optical sight. The copilot could <b>swivel</b> his <b>seat</b> around to face backward and sight the guns directly.|$|R
