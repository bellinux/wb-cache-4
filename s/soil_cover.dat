5|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>cover</b> in {{the city}} region is {{predominantly}} sandy due to its proximity to the sea. In the suburbs, the <b>soil</b> <b>cover</b> is largely alluvial and loamy. The underlying rock of the region is composed of black Deccan basalt flows, and their acidic and basic variants {{dating back to the}} late Cretaceous and early Eocene eras. Mumbai sits on a seismically active zone owing to the presence of 23 fault lines in the vicinity. The area is classified as a Seismic Zone III region, which means an earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale may be expected.|$|E

A Brazilian {{study investigated the}} termite assemblages of three sites of Caatinga under different levels of anthropogenic disturbance in the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil were sampled using 65 x 2 m transects. A total of 26 species of termites {{were present in the}} three sites, and 196 encounters were recorded in the transects. The termite assemblages were considerably different among sites, with a conspicuous reduction in both diversity and abundance with increased disturbance, related to the reduction of tree density and <b>soil</b> <b>cover,</b> and with the intensity of trampling by cattle and goats. The wood-feeders were the most severely affected feeding group.|$|E

The aim of this work was to evaluate the root effective depth of the strawberry crop under different water levels and <b>soil</b> <b>covers.</b> The experiment was conducted using a factorial scheme 2 × 2 (<b>soil</b> <b>covers</b> and water levels). As <b>soil</b> <b>covers</b> a clear plastic and a black plastic were used. Irrigation was applied until the soil water potential reached - 0. 010 and - 0. 070 MPa, at 10 cm depth. The root samples were collected beside the plants each 10 cm, up to 60 cm depth, using an auger hole with 7 cm of diameter, 159 days after planting, with five replications. The results concerning root length per unit of volume showed that the roots are concentrated in the upper langers. <b>Soil</b> <b>covers</b> and water levels did not influence the root length distribution.

Of them, six types form 88,7% of the soil cover: cinnamon soils (22,0%); chernozem (20,4%); grey forest soils (17,0%); brown forest soils (14,8%); alluvial soils (9,0%) and smolnitsi (5,4%).|$|E
25|$|Most of Goa's <b>soil</b> <b>cover</b> {{is made up}} of laterites rich in ferric-aluminium oxides and reddish in colour. Further inland {{and along}} the riverbanks, the soil is mostly {{alluvial}} and loamy. The soil is rich in minerals and humus, thus conducive to agriculture. Some of the oldest rocks in the Indian subcontinent are found in Goa between Molem and Anmod on Goa's border with Karnataka. The rocks are classified as Trondjemeitic Gneiss estimated to be 3,600 million years old, dated by rubidium isotope dating. A specimen of the rock is exhibited at Goa University.|$|E

25|$|From {{the base}} to the summit, floral species {{diminish}} with increasingly shallow soil levels. The summit {{is home to}} many different specialized sub-alpine species which can retain moisture {{for long periods of}} time. Alpine and sub-alpine species include mountain ash, cotton grass, sheep laurel, mountain sandwort, and the mountain cranberry. Krummholz, trees stunted by harsh weather, are found on Mount Monadnock, as are several alpine bogs. Lower elevations on Mount Monadnock are clad in northern hardwood forest species; middle elevations support stands of red spruce. Before the fires, Mount Monadnock was totally covered in a red spruce forest. Since the summit has been barren of <b>soil</b> <b>cover,</b> red spruce have been slowly ascending back towards the top in a process known as ecological succession.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} soil zones. The Northern forest-steppe zone covers the Danubian Plain and the Pre-Balkan up to 600–700m altitude. The Danubian Plain is characterised by the fertile black earth chernozem, that {{accounts}} for 54% of the zone's area, while the Pre-Balkan is dominated by grey forest soils (39%), which have good physical characteristics but are low in organic matter and phosphorus. The Southern xerothermal zone encompasses Southern Bulgaria up to 700–800m altitude and includes several specific soil types due to the more diverse topography and climate. The most common soil types are the cinnamon forest soils with acidic (cinnamonic) traces, smolnitsi and yellow-podzolic soils. The Mountain zone covers the mountainous regions above 700–800m altitude and has a zonal <b>soil</b> <b>cover.</b> The brown forest soils are distributed at altitudes of 1000–2000m, the dark mountain forest soils {{can be found at}} 1700–2200m altitude and the mountain meadow soils— above 1700m. These soils are typically shallow and prone to erosion and are usually acid to strongly acid.|$|E
25|$|Kulpahar region {{comprises}} areas {{which are}} essentially covered by grey, pink, red granitic rock and black dolerite. The rocks are generally medium to coarse to very coarse grained, having variegated colours with varying textural patterns. In geological nomenclature {{they can be}} classified {{on the basis of}} colour, grain size and texture. Over half of the areas identified so far appear suitable for extracting blocks of two cubic meters in size from the surface outcrops. The granite with red feldspar having presence of white and bluish quartz has caught the fancy of buyers and has become quite popular in national and international markets during the last 10 years, The remaining outcrops would be suited for blocks of smaller size. Ruby red granite is good in quality and is very popular in national and international markets, In granitic terrain the rocks may occur in the form of widespread sheets exposed above the ground level, in the form of hillocks, as high ground or below the ground under <b>soil</b> <b>cover.</b> They may also occur as boulders of different size and shapes spread over the sheet rock. They may be found as dykes, particularly of black and green types, as long narrow ridges often concealed beneath the surface. A major part of granite deposits in these regions are underground and have to be extracted by open cast mining. Underground granite block is more compact and require sophisticated and specialised machinery which adds to the cost of mining.|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of green manure with perennial herbaceous legumes {{has emerged as}} an interesting practice for vegetable production, improving the cultivation environment and increasing crop yields. In the present study we evaluated the organic okra cultivation in <b>soil</b> <b>covered</b> with perennial herbaceous legumes. The treatments consisted of okra grown in bare <b>soil</b> (control) or <b>covered</b> with tropical kudzo (Pueraria phaseoloides), perennial soybean (Glycine wightii), calopogonium (Calopogonium muconoides), Pinto peanut (Arachis pintoi) and Stylosanthes capitata and Stylosanthes macrocephala. A randomized block design with four replications was used. The weeding of legumes was realized before the okra was sown and this allowed the addition of quantities of dry matter, highlighting the potential of tropical kudzo (3. 74 t ha- 1), perennial soybean (1. 55 t ha- 1) and peanut (1. 30 t ha- 1). Okra cropped in <b>soil</b> <b>covered</b> with tropical kudzo and perennial soybean had the weed lowest dry matter accumulation until 150 days after sowing the okra. At 150 days after sowing the okra, only the areas covered with peanut and calopogonium had higher volumes {{of water in the}} soil compared to the control. Throughout the harvest, the okra plants grown in <b>soil</b> <b>covered</b> with perennial soybean and tropical kudzo showed the greatest heights.

40|$|Biological <b>soil</b> <b>covers</b> such as lichens have {{critical}} {{roles in}} soil stability {{and prevention of}} erosion. In order to study the effect of lichen biological covers on aggregate stability and soil conservation, loess hills covered with lichen and uncovered ones were selected in Northern Golestan Province. Five samples {{were taken from the}} depth 0 to 5 cm of both two areas for physico-chemical analyses. The undisturbed soil samples were taken for micromorphological studies, too. Analyses of soils revealed that soil organic carbon content increased markedly, compared to uncovered soils. Mean weight diameter also increased about three folds in <b>soils</b> <b>covered</b> with lichen. Fungal hyphae and polysaccharides excretions bind soil particles together and increase size of aggregates. Micromorphological study of thin sections showed that uncovered soils had a weak and massive structure, but <b>soils</b> <b>covered</b> with lichen had a crumb granular and also well -separated angular block and higher proportion of voids. Due to the effect of lichen on upward movement of calcium carbonate, crystallitic b-fabric appeared in the surface layer of <b>covered</b> <b>soils</b> and speckled b-fabric underneath.

2500|$|Due to the {{increase}} in temperature of the soil, CO2 levels in our atmosphere increase, the mean average temperature of the Earth is rising. This is due to man's activities such as forest clearing, soil denuding, developments that destroy autotrophic processes. With the loss of photosynthetic plants covering and cooling the surface of the soil, the infrared energy penetrates the soil heating it up and causing a rise in heterotrophic bacteria. Heterotrophs in the soil quickly degrade the organic matter and soil structure crumbles thus it dissolves into streams, rivers into the sea. Much of the organic matter swept away in floods caused by forest clearing goes into estuaries, wetlands and eventually into the open ocean. Increased turbidity of surface waters causes biological oxygen demand and more autotrophic organisms die in the wake of man's destruction. Carbon dioxide levels rise with increased respiration of soil bacteria after temperatures rise due to loss of <b>soil</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E

[...] In [...] many areas across the prairies, large circular medicine wheels were made as astronomical devices, directional maps, and for ceremonial use. [...] Some of these medicine wheels are large, and many were destroyed for agricultural needs by clearing the grasslands of any rocks. [...] Some are intact, {{such as in the}} Turtle Mountains, and other sandy, rocky, or more remote areas that had less crop farms and settlements. [...] Mound building was also associated in some way with petroform use. [...] Petroforms originally predated the use of mounds and other human-made earthen works that required more time and effort. [...] Although mound building could have originally been necessary and practical to provide some higher ground during floods. [...] There is some speculation that larger mounds would have served as dikes and defensive fortifications, including providing higher ground to keep watch.|$|E
