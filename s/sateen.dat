60|$|BLOOM: It overpowers me. The warm impress of {{her warm}} form. Even to sit {{where a woman}} has sat, {{especially}} with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white <b>sateen</b> coatpans. So womanly, full. It fills me full.|$|E

60|$|She was stout, and {{her face}} and lands were as white {{as though she had}} been drowned in a barrel of vinegar. One hand held {{together}} at her throat a buttonless flannel dressing sacque whose lines had been cut by no tape or butterick known to mortal woman.

60|$|Anne was {{standing}} in the gable room, looking solemnly at three new dresses spread out on the bed. One was of snuffy colored gingham which Marilla had been tempted to buy from a peddler the preceding summer because it looked so serviceable; one was of black-and-white checkered <b>sateen</b> which she had picked up at a bargain counter in the winter; and one was a stiff print of an ugly blue shade which she had purchased that week at a Carmody store.|$|E
50|$|Calendering is a {{finishing}} process used on cloth, paper, or plastic film. A calender is employed, usually to smooth, coat, or thin a material. With textiles, fabric is passed under rollers at high temperatures and pressures.

60|$|Behind a pile {{of goods}} another safe was discovered, and this was found to contain £8500 in money, nearly a hundred watches, and {{a large amount of}} ladies’ jewellery.

Babbitt's party politely edged through them and into the whitewashed room, at the front of which was a dais with a red-plush throne and a pine altar painted watery blue, as used nightly by the Grand Masters and Supreme Potentates of innumerable lodges. The hall was full. As Babbitt pushed through the fringe standing at the back, he heard the precious tribute, [...] "That's him!"

50|$|By 1877, {{the company}} {{employed}} 550 and owned fifty four tenements. The number of stockholders increased to twenty one. In 1899, a complete electric light plant was installed.

By 1917, the Poccaset Manufacturing Company was capitalized at $1,200,000 and had a capacity of 123,000 spindles and 2,874 looms. It produced <b>sateens,</b> twills and plain cloths.|$|R
50|$|Gum {{arabic and}} gum Senegal are both {{traditional}} thickenings, but expense {{prevents them from}} being used for any but pale, delicate tints. They are especially useful thickenings for the light ground colours of soft muslins and <b>sateens</b> {{on account of the}} property they possess of dissolving completely out of the fibres of the cloth in the post-printing washing process, and they have a long flowing, viscous rheology, giving sharp print and good penetration in the cloth. Today guar gum and tamarind derivates offer a cheaper alternative.|$|R

60|$|Anne {{started off}} irreproachable, arrayed in the stiff {{black-and-white}} <b>sateen,</b> which, while decent as regards length {{and certainly not}} open {{to the charge of}} skimpiness, contrived to emphasize every corner and angle of her thin figure. Her hat was a little, flat, glossy, new sailor, the extreme plainness of which had likewise much disappointed Anne, who had permitted herself secret visions of ribbon and flowers. The latter, however, were supplied before Anne reached the main road, for being confronted halfway down the lane with a golden frenzy of wind-stirred buttercups and a glory of wild roses, Anne promptly and liberally garlanded her hat with a heavy wreath of them. Whatever other people might have thought of the result it satisfied Anne, and she tripped gaily down the road, holding her ruddy head with its decoration of pink and yellow very proudly.|$|E
6000|$|... "On Hooligan Alley, as I {{prefer to}} call the street our {{headquarters}} was on, there was a row of flat 'dobe houses with red tile roofs, some straw shacks full of Indians and dogs, and one two-story wooden house with balconies a little farther down. That was where General Tumbalo, the comandante and commander of the military forces, lived. Right across the street was a private residence built like a combination bake-oven and folding-bed. One day, O'Connor and me were passing it, single file, on the flange they called a sidewalk, when {{out of the window}} flies a big red rose. O'Connor, who is ahead, picks it up, presses it to his fifth rib, and bows to the ground. By Carrambos! that man certainly had the Irish drama chaunceyized. I looked around expecting to see the little boy and girl in white <b>sateen</b> ready to jump on his shoulder while he jolted their spinal columns and ribs together through a breakdown, and sang: 'Sleep, Little One, Sleep.' ...|$|E
60|$|All the {{preparations}} for the funeral ran easily and happily under Mrs. Johnson's skilful hands. On {{the eve of the}} sad event she produced a reserve of black <b>sateen,</b> the kitchen steps and a box of tin-tacks, and decorated the house with festoons and bows of black in the best possible taste. She tied up the knocker with black crape, and put a large bow over the corner of the steel engraving of Garibaldi, and swathed the bust of Mr. Gladstone, that had belonged to the deceased, with inky swathings. She turned the two vases that had views of Tivoli and the Bay of Naples round, so that these rather brilliant landscapes were hidden and only the plain blue enamel showed, and she anticipated the long-contemplated purchase of a tablecloth for the front room, and substituted a violet purple cover for the now very worn and faded raptures and roses in plushette that had hitherto done duty there. Everything that loving consideration could do to impart a dignified solemnity to her little home was done.|$|E
50|$|Driving power {{included}} 11 water turbines with {{a combined}} horsepower of 8,550, and supplementary steam engines of 700 horsepower were employed. Seventy per cent of the spindles were used in making yarns for sale principally among weavers in the St. Petersburg and Moscow textile districts. A specialty of the mill was 90s ply yarn, made from Egyptian yarn, for the rubber-tire manufacturers. The range of yarns produced was wide, running from 3s to 90s, and about 330,000 of the spindles were mules. The woven textile consisted mainly of print cloth in various types of construction and <b>sateens,</b> both woven from 34s warp and 38s weft. Practically all the goods were shipped to a factory in Moscow, in which the firm had a large interest.|$|R
50|$|The Linwood Mill {{was built}} in 1866 {{by members of the}} Whitin family, who had {{purchased}} land in the area in the late 1840s. The Whitins had a history in the textile industry dating as far back as 1809, and are for whom the Northbridge village of Whitinsville is named. At the time of Linwood's development they owned virtually all of the textile industry in Northbridge. The Linwood property was built to process cotton, and produced cambrics, <b>sateens,</b> and shirting fabric. The original mill was a 3.5 story brick structure, which was expanded c. 1870 {{with the addition of a}} steam power plant in order to increase production. From the 1870s, the only other surviving building is a brick storehouse.|$|R
6000|$|You {{must not}} {{think that there was}} any TELLING of these stories of this life-long series by Mr. Hoopdriver. He never dreamt that they were known to a soul. If {{it were not for the}} trouble, I would, I think, go back and rewrite this section from the beginning, expunging the {{statements}} that Hoopdriver was a poet and a romancer, and saying instead that he was a playwright and acted his own plays. He was not only the sole performer, but the entire audience, and the entertainment kept him almost continuously happy. Yet even that playwright comparison scarcely expresses all the facts of the case. After all, very many of his dreams never got acted at all, possibly indeed, most of them, the dreams of a solitary walk for instance, or of a tramcar ride, the dreams dreamt behind the counter while trade was slack and mechanical foldings and rollings occupied his muscles. Most of them were little dramatic situations, crucial dialogues, the return of Mr. Hoopdriver to his native village, for instance, in a well-cut holiday suit and natty gloves, the unheard asides of the rival neighbours, the delight of the old 'mater,' the intelligence--"A ten-pound rise all at once from Antrobus, mater. Whad d'yer think of that?" [...] or again, the first whispering of love, dainty and witty and tender, to the girl he served a few days ago with <b>sateen,</b> or a gallant rescue of generalised beauty in distress from truculent insult or ravening dog.|$|E
6000|$|The Larkins {{sisters had}} done wonders with grey <b>sateen.</b> The idea of orange blossom and white veils had been {{abandoned}} reluctantly {{on account of the}} expense of cabs. A novelette in which the heroine had stood at the altar in [...] "a modest going-away dress" [...] had materially assisted this decision. Miriam was frankly tearful, and so indeed was Annie, but with laughter as well to carry it off. Mr. Polly heard Annie say something vague about never getting a chance because of Miriam always sticking about at home like a cat at a mouse-hole, that became, as people say, food for thought. Mrs. Larkins was from the first flushed, garrulous, and wet and smeared by copious weeping; an incredibly soaked and crumpled and used-up pocket handkerchief never left the clutch of her plump red hand. [...] "Goo' girls, all of them," [...] she kept on saying in a tremulous voice; [...] "such-goo-goo-goo-girls!" [...] She wetted Mr. Polly dreadfully when she kissed him. Her emotion affected the buttons down the back of her bodice, and almost the last filial duty Miriam did before entering on her new life was to close that gaping orifice for the eleventh time. Her bonnet was small and ill-balanced, black adorned with red roses, and first it got over her right eye until Annie told her of it, and then she pushed it over her left eye and looked ferocious for a space, and after that baptismal kissing of Mr. Polly the delicate millinery took fright and climbed right up to the back part of her head and hung on there by a pin, and flapped piteously at all the larger waves of emotion that filled the gathering. Mr. Polly became more and more aware of that bonnet as time went on, until he felt for it like a thing alive. Towards the end it had yawning fits.|$|E
6000|$|That {{afternoon}} Ethel put on {{her pretty}} <b>sateen</b> and her witching little white hat, with two natural dog-roses pinned on one side, and went pleased and proud up to the vicarage. The Reverend John Creedy was there, not in full clerical costume, but arrayed in tennis flannels, with only a loose white tie beneath his flap collar to mark his newly acquired spiritual dignity. He was a comely looking negro enough, full-blooded, but not too broad-faced nor painfully African in type; {{and when he was}} playing tennis his athletic quick limbs and his really handsome build took away greatly from the general impression of an inferior race. His voice was of the ordinary Oxford type, open, pleasant, and refined, with a certain easy-going air of natural gentility, hardly marred by just the faintest tinge of the thick negro blur in the broad vowels. When he talked to Ethel--and the vicar's wife took good care that they should talk together a great deal--his conversation was of a sort that she seldom heard at Walton Magna. It was full of London and Oxford, of boat-races at Iffley and cricket matches at Lord's; of people and books whose very names Ethel had never heard--one of them was a Mr. Mill, she thought, and another a Mr. Aristotle--but which she felt vaguely to be one step higher in the intellectual scale than her own level. Then his friends, to whom he alluded casually, not like one who airs his grand acquaintances, were such very distinguished people. There was a real live lord, apparently, at the same college with him, and he spoke of a young baronet whose estate lay close by, as plain [...] "Harrington of Christchurch," [...] without any [...] "Sir Arthur"--a thing which even the vicar himself would hardly have ventured to do. She knew that he was learned, too; {{as a matter of fact}} he had taken a fair second class in Greats at Oxford; and he could talk delightfully of poetry and novels. To say the truth, John Creedy, in spite of his black face, dazzled poor Ethel, for he was more of a scholar and a gentleman than anybody with whom she had ever before had the chance of conversing on equal terms.|$|E

Although he claimed the works were completely abstract, he admitted to himself that the tape represented the aura of living creatures on a landscape.

50|$|The sheen and softer feel of <b>sateen</b> is {{produced}} through the satin weave structure. Warp yarns are floated over weft yarns, for example four over and one under. (In a weft-faced satin or <b>sateen,</b> the weft yarns are floated over the warp yarns.) Standard plain weaves use a one-over, one-under structure. The long floats produce a surface that is smooth {{to the touch}} and reduces light scattering to increase shine. This weave structure is more susceptible to wear than other weaves.|$|E
