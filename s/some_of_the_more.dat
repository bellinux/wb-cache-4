5|$|The use of Newton's Second Law as a {{definition}} of force has been disparaged in <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> rigorous textbooks, because it is essentially a mathematical truism.

Marine life consists of species typical of the Aegean Sea, as well as some species usually found elsewhere.|$|E

At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.|$|E

5|$|In 1818, Jennings began {{promoting}} a large-scale plan for internal {{improvements in the}} state.

5|$|In later years, Wolff said he {{was always}} wary of Heydrich, {{who seemed to be}} waiting for an {{opportunity}} to move against him and disgrace him with Himmler.

Heydrich maintained a dialogue with him, but cautiously, especially after Jeckeln ran afoul of Himmler in the late 1930s and early 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} aspects of the Roman world, chariot racing {{continued}} in the Byzantine Empire, although the Byzantines did not keep as many records and statistics as the Romans did.

The six charioteers about whom these laudatory verses were written were Anastasius, Julianus of Tyre, Faustinus, his son, Constantinus, Uranius, and Porphyrius. Although Anastasius's single epigram reveals almost nothing about him, Porphyrius is much better known, having thirty-four known poems dedicated to him.|$|E
