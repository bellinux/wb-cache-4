40|$|Mobile phones {{have evolved}} to be smart {{computers}} (<b>smartphones)</b> supporting {{a wide range of}} information services that can be accessed anytime and from (almost) anywhere. With the increasing number of users and greater incursion into people's life, <b>smartphones</b> have the potential to significantly influence the touristic experience. This study explores the mediation mechanisms of <b>smartphones</b> by examining stories provided by travelers related to their use of <b>smartphones</b> (and associated applications) for traveling purposes. The results reveal that <b>smartphones</b> can change tourists' behavior and emotional states by addressing a wide variety of information needs; in particular, the instant information support of <b>smartphones</b> enables tourists to more effectively solve problems, share experiences, and "store" memories. The implications of these findings are important in that they suggest a huge potential for <b>smartphones</b> in changing many aspects of the tourism business. © 2012 SAGE Publications...|$|R

To make the device stand out among its competition, the HTC One was developed with a major emphasis on unique hardware and software features; which included a unibody aluminum frame, a 1080p full-HD display, dual front-facing stereo speakers, a camera with a custom image sensor and the ability to automatically generate montages of media, an updated version of HTC’s Sense user experience, BlinkFeed—an aggregator of news and social network content, and an electronic program guide app with the ability to serve as a universal remote via an IR blaster located in the device’s power button.|$|E

40|$|<b>Smartphones</b> offer {{functionalities}} to {{end users}} which were formerly only provided by personal computers. However,the adaptation of technologies enabling these functionalities also inherited the vulnerabilities of these technologies. To enable <b>smartphones</b> {{to address these}} threats appropriate security measures have to be identified and implemented. Another technology which has recently gained popularity is cloud computing. Due to the resource constraints of <b>smartphones,</b> realizing security services for <b>smartphones</b> {{in the form of}} cloud services seem to be a natural fit. This paper proposes a generic architecture for providing security services in the cloud for <b>smartphones</b> within a corporate environment. Preliminary results of experimental performance and battery measurements are presented supporting the core idea of the architecture to offload computationally expensive security functions from <b>smartphones</b> to resource rich cloud environments.

5000|$|There {{has been}} an {{industry}} shift from feature phones (including low-end <b>smartphones),</b> which rely mainly on volume, to high-end flagship <b>smartphones</b> which also enjoy higher margins, thus high-end <b>smartphones</b> are much more lucrative for manufacturers than feature phones. For instance Apple Inc.'s operating margins from the iPhone remain high since these devices have always been sold to carriers at a high enough cost which compels carriers to get wireless customers to sign multiyear contracts. The shift away from feature phones has forced wireless carriers to increase subsidies of handsets, and the high selling prices of flagship <b>smartphones</b> have had {{a negative effect on}} the wireless carriers (AT&T Mobility, Verizon, and Sprint) who have seen their EBITDA service margins drop as they sold more <b>smartphones</b> and fewer feature phones. Trends have shown that consumers are willing to pay more for <b>smartphones</b> that deliver more features/applications such as 4G LTE and touchscreens, and <b>smartphones</b> have become a part of North American pop culture (while feature phones are no longer [...] "cool"). Though <b>smartphones</b> cost more to produce they deliver high profit margins than feature phones, thus device makers and wireless carriers have shifted towards smartphones.http://www.eweek.com/mobile/slideshows/smartphones-sales-finally-overtake-feature-phones-10-reasons-why/ ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, <b>Smartphones</b> have been {{developed}} and increasingly integrated with people’s lives not only for social use, but professional use as well. Many researchers claim that <b>Smartphones</b> can have negative consequences in the workplace such as lowering productivity, separating people from their realities, bringing stress from personal issues to work, and creating bad manners. Companies, however, {{have a difficult time}} mandating a policy in regards to prohibiting the use of <b>Smartphones.</b> Therefore, CEOs and corporate leaders should encourage their employees to use their <b>Smartphones</b> as tools for increasing their company’s efficiency. This research aims to examine the results of the use of <b>Smartphones</b> in the workplace as integrated internal connection tools. Using <b>Smartphones</b> in the workplace can be valuable in three ways: promoting autonomy, strengthening relationships with peers as well as superiors, and improving knowledge-sharing.
