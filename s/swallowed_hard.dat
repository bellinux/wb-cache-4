2500|$|Three media {{witnesses}} said Franklin {{did not seem}} to show pain. [...] He did not make any final written statement and did not speak a word in the death chamber. [...] After the injection, he blinked a few times, breathed heavily a few times, and <b>swallowed</b> <b>hard,</b> the {{witnesses said}}. [...] The heaving of his chest slowed, and finally stopped, they said.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has often}} been {{suggested}} {{that at least some}} dinosaurs used swallowed stones, known as gastroliths, to aid digestion by grinding their food in muscular gizzards, and that this was a feature they shared with birds. In 2007 Oliver Wings reviewed references to gastroliths in scientific literature and found considerable confusion, starting with the lack of an agreed and objective definition of [...] "gastrolith". He found that <b>swallowed</b> <b>hard</b> stones or grit can assist digestion in birds that mainly feed on grain but may not be essential—and that birds that eat insects in summer and grain in winter usually get rid of the stones and grit in summer. Gastroliths have often been described as important for sauropod dinosaurs, whose diet of vegetation required very thorough digestion, but Wings concluded that this idea was incorrect: gastroliths are found with {{only a small percentage of}} sauropod fossils; where they have been found, the amounts are too small and in many cases the stones are too soft to have been effective in grinding food; most of these gastroliths are highly polished, but gastroliths used by modern animals to grind food are roughened by wear and corroded by stomach acids; hence the sauropod gastroliths were probably swallowed accidentally. On the other hand, he concluded that gastroliths found with fossils of advanced theropod dinosaurs such as Sinornithomimus and Caudipteryx resemble those of birds, and that the use of gastroliths for grinding food may have appeared early in the group of dinosaurs from which these dinosaurs and birds both evolved.|$|E

50|$|Denudation (removal {{of matter}} {{to a lower}} level) is caused mainly by air and water movement. Humic acids {{generated}} by worms disintegrate rock; their burrowing behaviour speeds this up. But as the soil layer thickens, this process is slowed down. Worms <b>swallow</b> <b>hard</b> objects (e.g. stones) to aid digestion, which causes attrition to such objects. This has geological significance, especially for the smaller particles which otherwise are eroded very slowly.|$|R

Starbuck relieves him and appoints Mr. Gaeta as the new XO, but he also refuses to follow her command. Starbuck narrows her eyes as Helo asserts his authority to relieve her of command.|$|R

60|$|The {{moment had}} come. How sad, tragic, yet glorious for him! It {{would be like}} a magic touch upon this lovely, cold, white ghost of Fay Larkin, {{transforming}} her into a living, breathing girl. He held his love as a thing aloof, and, as such, intangible because of the living death she believed she lived, it had no warmth and intimacy for them. What might it not become with a lightning flash of revelation? He dreaded, yet he was driven to speak. He waited, <b>swallowing</b> <b>hard,</b> fighting the tumultuous storm of emotion, and his eyes dimmed.|$|R

5000|$|His first novel, The Recognitions, {{appeared}} in 1955. A lengthy, complex, and allusive work, {{it had to}} wait to find its audience. Newspaper reviewers considered it overly intellectual, overwritten, and perhaps {{on the principle of}} [...] ("all that is unknown appears obscene"), filthy. (The book was defended by Jack Green in a series of broadsheets blasting the critics; the series was collected later under the title Fire the Bastards!) Shortly after the publication of The Recognitions, Gaddis married his first wife, Patricia Black, who would give birth to two children: Sarah (who has written a novel, <b>Swallow</b> <b>Hard,</b> inspired by her relationship with her father) and Matthew.|$|R
5000|$|Nina Chanel Abney (born 1982) is an American artist. She {{was born}} in Harvey, Illinois. She is an African American {{contemporary}} artist and painter who explores race, gender, pop culture, and politics in her work. She attended Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois and received a BFA with a dual major in studio art and computer science. Abney then received an MFA at the Parsons School of Design. Her work uses symbols and bright colors to present new ways of approaching loaded topics as she invites viewers to draw their own conclusions. Blending the playful and the serious, Abney has said that her work is “easy to <b>swallow,</b> <b>hard</b> to digest.” ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{that moment}} the old pair entered the door. Zephaniah Pennel came and stood quietly by the pillow where the little form was laid, and lifted {{a corner of the}} blanket. The tiny head was turned to one side, showing the soft, warm cheek, and the little hand was holding tightly a morsel of the flannel blanket. He stood <b>swallowing</b> <b>hard</b> for a few moments. At last he said, with deep humility, to the wise and mighty woman who held her, [...] "I'll tell you what it is, Miss Roxy, I'll give all there is in my old chest yonder if you'll only make her--live." ...|$|R
60|$|Anderson paused huskily and <b>swallowed</b> <b>hard</b> {{while he}} looked away across the fields. Lenore felt herself drawn by an irresistible power.

60|$|It {{seemed to}} Helen that Pedro {{understood}} {{they were talking}} about him, for he looked ashamed, and <b>swallowed</b> <b>hard,</b> and dropped his gaze. She knew something of the truth about the love of dogs for their owners. This story of Dale's, however, was stranger than any she had ever heard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Matters {{had been}} no different," [...] Ruth assured her. [...] "It was a bargain Mr. Wilding drove. It was the price I {{had to pay for}} Richard's life and honour."

5000|$|MTVs Christina Garibaldi {{wrote that}} [...] "The song {{is all about}} a {{critical}} point in a relationship {{and trying to figure}} out if your partner is in or out". Katy Forrester of Daily Mirror stated that [...] "The lyrics to this song make us <b>swallow</b> <b>hard</b> and sit thinking about everything in life" [...] and called it [...] "one of the best on the album". The Nationals Rob Garratt called the song [...] "A pop sing-along which sacrifices none of Adeles trademarked intimacy" [...] and called it [...] "a smart choice for the albums second single", though it turned out to be the fourth. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy wrote that [...] "they and Adele strike upon a shimmering mid-tempo pop parade".|$|R
