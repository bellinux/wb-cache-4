500|$|On November 30, 1693, {{little over}} a year after Phips had shut down the Court of Oyer and Terminer, Whitehall heard {{complaints}} against Phips regarding Short and Brenton, shepherded to London by Stoughton and Dudley. [...] A recall with the internal date of February 15, 1694, summoned Phips back to London to answer the charges. It took months for the letter to reach Boston. On July 4, 1694, Phips received the <b>summons</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> before the Lords of Trade. Stoughton, of all people, was ordered to oversee the gathering of evidence for the hearing, a galling reversal of fortunes for Phips. Phips spent much of the summer in Maine, at Pemaquid securing a peace treaty, and overseeing the frontier defenses near his birthplace.|$|E

2500|$|For a {{few months}} Bourne was left in Somerset, {{apparently}} as a prisoner on parole; but on 31 May 1560 he received a <b>summons</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> within twelve days before Parker and the Commissioners in London. He set out, as his reply to Parker shows, well knowing what to expect, and on 18 June was committed [...] to the Tower of London as a close prisoner, joining five other bishops already confined there. He remained in the Tower for three years, for {{most of that time}} in solitary confinement, [...] when an outbreak of the plague in September 1563 caused him and his companions to be for a time transferred into the keeping of certain of their Anglican successors in office; Bourne himself was apparently committed to that of Bishop Nicholas Bullingham of Lincoln.|$|E
2500|$|Then the Pope {{turned on}} the Colonna. He raised a small army {{with the help of}} the Orsini and their allies, and planned an {{expedition}} against Naples. In addition, on 7 November Clement VII issued a monitorium (<b>summons</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> for trial, de vi et proditione) against Cardinal Pompeo, but when Pompeo from Naples made an appeal to a future General Council, the Pope placed him under the ban. [...] On 21 November 1526, Cardinal Colonna was deprived of the Vice-Chancellorship after a trial conducted by the Archbishop of Ravenna (1524-1529) Benedetto Accolti, the Pope's secretary; twenty cardinals voted for his removal from office. [...] He was restored on 27 March 1527. The treaty with Moncada had been violated by the Pope in the expectation of French aid, which was not forthcoming. [...] The Emperor in the meantime sent an army of 7,000 Spanish and German troops from Carthagena to Naples on 24 October 1526. At the same time, the famous Tyrolean condottiere Georg von Frundsberg, having collected a large band of Landsknechts, descended into the Po Valley, headed for Milan. [...] His army was placed under the command of Duke Charles de Bourbon, who was engaged in the siege of Milan.|$|E

60|$|Mr Mortimer Lightwood, besides {{sustaining}} {{the character of}} one of the witnesses, doubled the part with that of the eminent solicitor who watched the proceedings on behalf of the representatives of the deceased, as was duly recorded in the newspapers. Mr Inspector watched the proceedings too, and kept his watching closely to himself. Mr Julius Handford having given his right address, and being reported in solvent circumstances as to his bill, though nothing more was known of him at his hotel except that his way of life was very retired, had no <b>summons</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear,</b> and was merely present in the shades of Mr Inspector's mind.|$|E
60|$|We of {{the family}} were, as may be imagined, much excited by {{the news of the}} return of this rich and childless uncle to England. On his part, {{although}} by no means exuberant in his hospitality, he showed some sense of his duty to his relations, and each of us in turn had an invitation to visit him. From the accounts of my cousins it appeared to be a melancholy business, and it was with mixed feelings that I at last received my own <b>summons</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> at Rodenhurst. My wife was so carefully excluded in the invitation that my first impulse was to refuse it, but the interests of the children had to be considered, and so, with her consent, I set out one October afternoon upon my visit to Wiltshire, with little thought of what that visit was to entail.|$|E
