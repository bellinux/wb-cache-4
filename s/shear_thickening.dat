40|$|The {{viscosity}} of {{a suspension}} of spherical Brownian particles {{is determined by}} Stokesian dynamics {{as a function of}} the Péclet number. Several new aspects concerning the theoretical derivation of the direct contribution of the Brownian motion to the bulk stress are given, along with the results obtained from a simulation of a monolayer. The simulations reproduce the experimental behavior generally observed in dense suspensions, and an explanation of this behavior is given by observing the evolution of the different contributions to the viscosity with shear rate. The shear thinning at low Péclet numbers is due to the disappearance of the direct Brownian contribution to the viscosity; the deformation of the equilibrium microstructure is, however, small. By contrast, at very high Péclet numbers the suspension <b>shear</b> <b>thickens</b> due to the formation of large clusters...|$|R

40|$|The complex {{nature of}} asphalt throws open {{challenges}} {{in terms of}} material characterization, pavement design and analysis procedures. This study is concerned with experimentally verifying the reversible changes in the material and we focus only on the mechanical properties. Two types of asphalt, unmodified parent asphalt and polymer modified asphalt were tested in a Brookfield programmable viscometer. The material was tested from 60 to 90 °C in increments of 5 °C. Each sample was tested before and after short term aging. The experimental plan consisted of subjecting the material to three continuous cycles of shearing, allowing the material to rest for one hour at the testing temperature after these three cycles and subjecting the material to one more cycle of shearing after rest period. The observations in terms of shear stress vs. time for the specific forward and reverse sweep revealed several interesting facts. The polymer modified asphalt <b>shear</b> <b>thickened</b> for every successive cycle before rest period in the temperature range of 60 - 70 °C.

This study elucidates the effects of sludge <b>shearing</b> during the <b>thickening</b> process on the microbial community structure {{and its effect on}} biogas production. Medium shearing resulted in approximately 15 % increase in biogas production. By contrast, excessive or high shearing led to a marked decrease in biogas production, possibly due to sludge disintegration and cell lysis. Microbial analysis using 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that medium shearing increased the evenness and diversity of the microbial community in the anaerobic digester, which is consistent with the observed improved biogas production. By contrast, microbial diversity decreased under either excessive shearing or high shearing condition. In good agreement with the observed decrease in biogas production, the abundance of Bacteroidales and Syntrophobaterales (which are responsible for hydrolysis and acetogenesis) decreased due to high <b>shearing</b> during recuperative <b>thickening...</b>|$|R
40|$|The non-Newtonian {{rheology}} {{is calculated}} numerically to second {{order in the}} volume fraction in steady simple shear flows for Brownian hard spheres {{in the presence of}} hydrodynamic and excluded volume interactions. Previous analytical and numerical results for the low-shear structure and rheology are confirmed, demonstrating that the viscosity shear thins proportional to Pe 2, where Pe is the dimensionless shear rate or Péclet number, owing to the decreasing contribution of Brownian forces to the viscosity. In the large Pe limit, remnants of Brownian diffusion balance convection in a boundary-layer in the compressive region of the flow. In consequence, the viscosity <b>shear</b> <b>thickens</b> when this boundary-layer coincides with the near-contact lubrication regime of the hydrodynamic interaction. Wakes are formed at large Pe in the extensional zone downstream from the reference particle, leading to broken symmetry in the pair correlation function. As a result of this asymmetry and that in the boundary-layer, finite normal stress differences are obtained as well as positive departures in the generalized osmotic pressure from its equilibrium value. The first normal stress difference changes from positive to negative values as Pe is increased when the hard-sphere limit is approached. This unusual effect is caused by the hydrodynamic lubrication forces that maintain particles in close proximity well into the extensional quadrant of the flow. The study demonstrates that many of the non-Newtonian effects observed in concentrated suspensions by experiments and by Stokesian dynamics simulations are present also in dilute suspensions...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the mechanical and durable press properties of cotton woven apparels by applying nano-technology. Cotton fiber is an important material in the textile industry. However, its poor smoothness performance after laundering has caused {{a major problem in}} its application. Durable press finishing process can increase wrinkle resistance but also induce deleterious loss in mechanical strength in treated fabric due to the rigid cross-linking formed on the other hand. Nano-sized polymeric particles have been synthesized and characterized to solve this problem. A core-shell structure has been observed in the particles with functional polymer on the surface. Nano-particles exhibit functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxylic groups will react with hydroxyl groups present in the cellulosic fiber. After curing, those particles will form a film on the fabric surface which then will help to impart the mechanical strengths. The fabric treatment process is optimized by varying different parameters such as the proportion of cross-linking reagent and catalyst as well as the curing temperature and duration time. Results indicated that application of nano-particles will improve the tensile, tearing strength as well as the abrasion resistance of the treated fabric. Both tensile and tearing strength retentions are increased by at least 20 % when compared with native fabric. Rheological studies provided useful information for the particles under <b>shear.</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>thickening</b> effect indicated the formation of clusters for the particles under shear.

40|$|The {{rheological}} behavior of hard-sphere colloidal suspensions in simple shear flow is examined theoretically and by dynamic simulation. The Stokesian Dynamics and Brownian Dynamics simulation techniques {{are used to}} study suspensions with and without many-body hydrodynamic interactions, respectively. Suspensions near equilibrium, where Brownian motion dominates, and at high shear rates, where hydrodynamic forces dominate, are examined. Steady-state simulations are performed using both simulation algorithms. The Brownian Dynamics system {{is found to be}} shear-thinning at low shear rates and undergoes a phase transition at high shear rates to a phase of hexagonally-packed strings aligned in the flow direction. Inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions eliminates the phase transition at high shear rates. Instead, the suspension is found to <b>shear</b> <b>thicken</b> due to a boundary layer of high particle probability that forms near contact where convection balances Brownian diffusion. This increases the role of strong hydrodynamic lubrication forces. <b>Shear</b> thinning and <b>thickening</b> data from many different volume fractions are collapsed using scaling theories. A previous steady-state theoretical analysis of the boundary layer at high shear rates (Brady & Morris 1997) is extended to include unsteady flow conditions. Theoretical results are found to be in agreement with start-up and flow-cessation simulations. A relation between start-up flow at low shear rates and the relaxation of equilibrium fluctuations is made. Equilibrium fluctuations are characterized using the shear-stress autocorrelation function and Green-Kubo formulae. Behavior of this function at short times is related to the behavior in an oscillatory shear flow at high frequencies that is also well-described by a boundary layer where unsteady convection balances Brownian diffusion. A new method for determining the components of the long-time self-diffusion tensor is proposed. Self-diffusion is found to be a decreasing function of volume fraction near equilibrium and an increasing function of volume fraction at high shear rates. Data is in agreement with previous theory and experiment. Due to the buildup of particle probability along the compressional axis relative to the extensional axis in simple shear flow, there is a nonzero off-diagonal component to the long-time self-diffusion tensor which is proportional to the shear rate. This component is positive near equilibrium and negative at high shear rate...|$|R

40|$|In {{this short}} paper we study the linearized {{stability}} {{of the flow of}} a chemically reacting fluid in a cylindrical pipe, under the assumption that the length of the pipe is far greater than its diameter. The fluid models that are considered have relevance to the flow of both polymeric liquids that are capable of undergoing chemical reactions and biological fluids such as the synovial fluid whose viscosity changes due to the concentration of the hyaluronan. The viscosity of the class of fluids that we consider can increase or decrease due to the concentration of the chemical that is being carried by the fluid and it can also shear thin or <b>shear</b> <b>thicken.</b> We non-dimensionalize the equations governing the motion of the fluid and then carry out an approximation wherein we retain terms that are of order unity in the Reynolds number and Péclet number. We further simplify the problem by seeking a special semi-inverse solution, in the same spirit as that which is used in the study of classical Hagen–Poiseuille flow, and look for solutions for the velocity field and the concentration that vary only with the radial coordinate. Under the above mentioned approximation, one can obtain an exact solution for the basic flow which then allows us to analytically consider the {{stability of the}} base flow to sufficiently small disturbances. On the basis of earlier studies of such fluids in the modeling of biological fluids, especially the synovial fluid, we consider two types of variation of the viscosity with the concentration. We find that flows in the cylindrical pipe, within the context of our approximation, are stable to sufficiently small disturbances, for both variations of the viscosity that are considered...|$|R

We use a mathematical model for the nanofluid that incorporates the effects of nanoparticle Brownian motion and thermophoresis. The non-Newtonian nature of the fluid is modeled by the power-law index n, and both cases of <b>shear</b> thinning and <b>thickening</b> are investigated. The governing set of equations is solved numerically using the shooting technique. The effects of physical and fluid parameters on the properties are determined for both instances of aiding and opposing buoyancy force.

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of {{deviation}} from Newton's Law that are observed in real systems. The most common deviation is shear thinning behavior, where the viscosity of the system decreases as the shear rate is increased. The second deviation is <b>shear</b> <b>thickening</b> behavior where, as the shear rate is increased, the viscosity of the system also increases. This behavior is observed because the system crystallizes under stress and behaves more like a solid than a solution. [...] Thus, the viscosity of a shear-thickening fluid is dependent on the shear rate. The presence of suspended particles often affects the viscosity of a solution. In fact, with the right particles, even a Newtonian fluid can exhibit non-Newtonian behavior. An example of this is cornstarch in water and is included in the Examples section below.|$|E
50|$|Rheology {{generally}} {{accounts for}} the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids, by characterizing the minimum number of functions that are needed to relate stresses with rate of change of strain or strain rates. For example, ketchup can have its viscosity reduced by shaking (or other forms of mechanical agitation, where the relative movement of different layers in the material actually causes the reduction in viscosity) but water cannot. Ketchup is a shear thinning material, like yogurt and emulsion paint (US terminology latex paint or acrylic paint), exhibiting thixotropy, where an increase in relative flow velocity will cause a reduction in viscosity, for example, by stirring. Some other non-Newtonian materials show the opposite behavior, rheopecty: viscosity going up with relative deformation, and are called <b>shear</b> <b>thickening</b> or dilatant materials. Since Sir Isaac Newton originated the concept of viscosity, the study of liquids with strain rate dependent viscosity is also often called Non-Newtonian fluid mechanics.|$|E
50|$|Dilatant {{materials}} have certain industrial uses {{due to their}} <b>shear</b> <b>thickening</b> behavior. For example, some all wheel drive systems use a viscous coupling unit full of dilatant fluid to provide power transfer between front and rear wheels. On high traction road surfacing, the relative motion between primary and secondary drive wheels is the same, so the shear is low and little power is transferred. When the primary drive wheels start to slip, the shear increases, causing the fluid to thicken. As the fluid thickens, the torque transferred to the secondary drive wheels increases proportionally, until {{the maximum amount of}} power possible in the fully thickened state is transferred. See also: limited slip differential, some types of which operate on the same principle.....To the operator, this system is entirely passive, engaging all four wheels to drive when needed, and dropping back to two wheel drive once the need has passed. This system is generally used for on-road vehicles rather than off-road vehicles, since the maximum viscosity of the dilatant fluid limits the amount of torque that can be passed across the coupling.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of simultaneous multipoint measurements in the flowfield and acoustic field of a Mach 1. 75 cold-air jet is presented. A series of four optical-deflectometer probes measured turbulent fluctuations {{in or near the}} jet flow, and eight microphones recorded the far-field pressure in the direction of peak emission. The correlation methodology involves the coherence between the delay-and-sum beamformer outputs of the optical-deflectometer probes and the microphones. This procedure yields results with greater fidelity and higher coherence levels than obtained with individual optical-deflectometer-to-microphone correlations. With the optical-deflectometer probes in the jet shear layer, there is a significant correlation, on the order of 0. 1, between the turbulent fluctuations and farfield noise. As the optical-deflectometer probe moves transversely away from the jet, its correlation with the microphone beamformer first drops and then increases. This trend signifies the transition from hydrodynamic to acoustic pressure fields. In the vicinity of the nozzle exit, the peak coherence between the beamformed opticaldeflectometer and microphone signals coincides with the physical location of the optical-deflectometer probe. However, as the <b>shear</b> layer <b>thickens</b> downstream, the peak coherence generally lags the probe location, which is a probable result of acoustic refraction by the mean flow.

In BCC metals the mature rolling microstructure consists of cells, microbands and shear bands on a length scale of fraction of a micron, to deformation and transition bands at the grain scale, when this is of the order of 10 or more microns. There is evidence that grain boundary regions are sometimes distinct from grain interiors. Wherever there is a relatively sharp change in either orientation or microstructure such locations are potential sites of recrystallisation nuclei. In this paper the results of a systematic investigation of the development of microstructure in rolled interstitial free (IF) steel using both transmission and scanning electron microscopy are presented. It is shown how the dislocation mesh structure, formed at the earliest stages of rolling, develops into the mature microstructure consisting of cells, microbands and shear bands.
