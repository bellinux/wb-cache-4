40|$|Abstract: A {{small scale}} {{sugarcane}} juice extractor using a screw pressing system was designed, constructed and tested. Consideration {{was given to}} the techno-economic status of the micro and small scale sugarcane farmers and juice processors who are the intended users of the machine. The functional parts of the machine included grating unit, extraction unit, prime mover, pulley, transmission belts, bearings and frame. The machine was tested with two varieties of sugarcane each at three levels of moisture content and results showed that average grating efficiency and juice yield of 87. 8 % and 2. 5 % respectively were obtained. Powered by a 3 hp single-phase electric motor, the machine was constructed with materials being available locally at affordable costs. A cottage sugarcane juice extraction plant based on this technology could provide employment {{and at the same time}} produce sugarcane juice and bagasse at low costs for sugar and biofuel industries. An improvement in the design, analysis and optimization of the worm <b>shaft</b> and <b>press</b> cage is expected to improve the juice yield and extraction efficiency; hence, this is highly recommended.

40|$|Now forging parts {{papermaking}} machines uses {{many different}} designs presses. Regardless {{of the type}} of construction, the water is filtered through paper to canvas cloth in the transverse direction, filtering water from the cloth can occur in the longitudinal direction (simple presses) or in the transverse direction (shaft with blind holes, grooved <b>shaft,</b> suction <b>shaft).</b> <b>Presses</b> of the native papermaking machines provide a dry cloth when pressed, about 35 ? 40 %. That is not enough, as for drying the paper spent a huge amount of thermal energy in the form of steam, so the development of the press, providing a significant increase in dry is relevant. One way of increasing dryness is usage of shoe press, which by increasing the length of the contact area increased while pressing, so dry cloth before drying section increasing to 50 ? 55 %. Work of presses of papermaking machine is measured by the amount of water removed, and uniform moisture content across the width of fabric after the presses. Dehydration capacity of presses depends primarily on the length of the extrusion zone delighted shaft and on the number of these zones. When pressing simultaneously with dehydration of the paper web changing its structure, increases the contact area between the fibers and the coupling strength between them. In the existing literature does not sufficiently covered shoe-type presses calculation that does not allow constructing them because kinetic regularities of the process is unknown. The {{purpose of this article is}} to establish the kinetics of the compaction and main parameters shoe-type press needed to develop methods of calculation and design shoe presses.

5000|$|In the {{interest}} of simplicity, all models used a friction-drive transmission. A roller (a metal wheel with a rubber surface vulcanized to increase its grip) on the front sprocket <b>shaft</b> was <b>pressed</b> against the machined rear surface of the engine flywheel, thus driving the sprocket shaft, the drive chains and the rear wheels. Moving the shift lever set the drive roller to various positions on the flywheel, either nearer the center or nearer the edge, effectively changing the [...] "gear ratio" [...] for climbing hills or driving on level roads. Moving the roller past the center point spun it backwards to give reverse gear. The front sprocket drive shaft was free to slide forward and backwards slightly, just enough to allow the roller {{to move away from}} the flywheel. The [...] "clutch pedal" [...] worked differently from most other cars, in that the operator had to hold their foot on the pedal to keep the roller pressed against the flywheel (the catalog claimed that the weight of the operator’s foot was sufficient to provide forward motion). Removing the foot from the pedal allowed the roller to spring back from the flywheel, effectively providing [...] "neutral" [...] so the car could be cranked without moving forwards.|$|R
50|$|For {{certain types}} of {{electric}} motors or generators to function, the coils of the rotor must be connected to complete an electrical circuit. To accomplish this, a copper or brass commutator or 'slip rings' are affixed to the <b>shaft,</b> and springs <b>press</b> braided copper wire 'brushes' onto the rings which conduct the current. Such brushes provided poor commutation as they moved from one commutator segment to the next. The cure was the introduction of 'high resistance brushes' made from graphite (sometimes with added copper). Although the resistance was {{of the order of}} tens of milliohms, they were high resistance enough to provide a gradual shift of current from one commutator segment to the next. The term brush remains in use. Since the brushes wear out, they can be replaced in products intended to allow maintenance.|$|R

40|$|PS 304 {{is a high}} {{temperature}} solid lubricant coating comprised of a nickel-chrome binder, chrome oxide hardener, barium-calcium fluoride {{high temperature}} lubricant, and silver as the low temperature lubricant. This coating is used to lubricate Oil-Free Foil Air Bearings as they experience friction and wear during start up and shut down. The coating deposition process begins with undercutting the shaft. This area is then sandblasted to provide a rough surface for the coating to adhere to. The coating powder is then sent through the plasma spray gun and a reasonably thick layer {{is applied to the}} undercut area of the shaft. The coating is then ground down even with the surface of the shaft and gets a nice polished finish. The foil air bearings use the solid lubricant, as mentioned above, during start up and shut down. During normal operating conditions, generally above 2000 RPM, the bearings utilize air as their lubricant. Foil air bearings are comprised of a thin top foil and a corrugated bump foil. They have an interference fit with the shaft before operation. As the air gets "trapped" between the top foil and the <b>shaft,</b> it <b>presses</b> the top foil against the bump foil, in turn compressing the bumps. As the bumps compress, it allows for the air to separate the top foil from the shaft, therefore, utilizing the trapped air as its lubricant...|$|R
5000|$|This {{generation}} {{was the first}} time Ford used Independent suspension on their full size 4x4 trucks, as well as being the first time any of the Big Three (automobile manufacturers) made a 4x4 full size truck without a solid front axle. Ford and Dana Holding Corporation called this the Twin Traction Beam or TTB and used many of Dana Spicer parts. The F-150 used a light duty Dana 44 TTB. From 1979-1984, the rear axle was typically a Ford 9-inch axle, with the Ford 8.8 axle being phased gradually until the 9" [...] was finally phased out before the 1987 model year. The F-250 used an 8 lug version of the Dana 44 TTB called the Dana 44 TTBHD with the Dana 50 TTB being an option. The rear was a Dana 60 until mid 1985 when Ford phased out that axle for their own Sterling 10.25. Dana 60s could be either full float or semi float and came with a range of gear ratios. Semi float Dana 60s were either c-clip style, which utilize c-clips to hold the axle <b>shafts</b> in, or <b>pressed</b> in bearings which held the axles in with a special wheel bearing that bolted to the outer axle housing inside the brake drum. These were typically used in lighter duty trucks. Up until then, early 1985 models were built with left over 1984 materials, making some parts tough to find. The F-350 used the Dana 50 TTB in front until a mid-year change in 1985, when the F-350 was fitted with the Dana 60 solid front axle. F-250s could be ordered with a Dana 50 TTB if it was a heavier duty model; all other F-250's were equipped with a Dana 44 TTB. These trucks were leaf sprung and used a single gas shock with no coil springs and radius arms like on the F-150. For the rear axle the F-350 trucks used a Dana 60 for the single rear wheel trucks and a Dana 70 for the dual rear wheel trucks until 1985 when Ford once again phased in their own Sterling axle. Factory lifts used 2" [...] blocks on the rear suspension, or 2" [...] front and 4" [...] rear on HD trucks, usually on F250s and higher trims. Heavier duty F150s could be ordered with 2" [...] blocks.|$|R
