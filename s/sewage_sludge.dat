5|$|The {{threat to}} humans in {{developed}} countries is rising {{as a result of}} social trends: the increase in organic farming, which uses manure and <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> rather than artificial fertilizers, and spreads parasites both directly and via the droppings of seagulls which feed on manure and sludge; the increasing popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods; imports of meat, seafood and salad vegetables from high-risk areas; and, as an underlying cause, reduced awareness of parasites compared with other public health issues such as pollution. In less-developed countries, inadequate sanitation and the use of human feces (night soil) as fertilizer and to enrich fish farm ponds continues to spread parasitic platyhelminths, and poorly designed water-supply and irrigation projects have provided additional channels for their spread. People in these countries often cannot afford the cost of fuel required to cook food thoroughly enough to kill parasites. Controlling parasites that infect humans and livestock has become more difficult, as many species have become resistant to drugs that used to be effective, mainly for killing juveniles in meat. While poorer countries still struggle with unintentional infection, cases have been reported of intentional infection in the US by dieters desperate for rapid weight-loss.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, the Corporation {{had made}} {{enquiries}} about purchasing a second-hand steam engine, approaching six locomotive manufacturers, but eventually acquired a new 0-4-0 saddle tank from Peckett and Sons Ltd, {{which was built}} at their Bristol works in 1918. The original engine became a spare, but was hired out to the Blackburn Meadows power station in March 1936. A year later it was condemned by the insurance company, and was sold for scrap to Maden and McKee Ltd, who were based in Liverpool. A replacement was sought, and a third 0-4-0 saddle tank, made by Hudswell Clarke in 1914, was bought from the Olympia Oil and Cake Company at Selby. It was coupled into a goods train, and arrived at the works in July 1937. At the works, as at Selby, it carried the name Olympia, painted on the tanks. The Peckett was overhauled by the Yorkshire Engine Company at Meadow Hall Works between 1945 and 1946. Because there was a statutory obligation to keep the treatment works operational, a special dispensation was obtained during the 1926 general strike, to allow this engine to run over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip. Kilnhurst tip eventually became full, and in January 1948, regular tipping operations ceased, after a new tip at Thrybergh opened. Tipping continued at Kilnhurst sporadically, until it was closed in 1959. During its operational life up to 1948, 2,917,480 tons of <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> was dumped at the site, and following closure, it was sold to the National Coal Board in 1961.|$|E

25|$|The 1987 WQA {{created a}} program for {{management}} of biosolids (sludge) generated by POTWs. The Act instructed EPA to develop guidelines for usage and disposal of <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> or biosolids. The EPA regulations: (1) Identify uses for <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge,</b> including disposal; (2) Specify factors {{to be taken into}} account in determining the measures and practices applicable to each such use or disposal (including publication of information on costs); and (3) Identify concentrations of pollutants which interfere with each such use or disposal. EPA created an Intra-Agency Sludge Task Force to aid in developing comprehensive sludge regulations that are designed to do the following: (1) Conduct a multimedia examination of <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> management, focusing on <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> generated by POTWs; and (2) develop a cohesive Agency policy on <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> management, designed to guide the Agency in implementing <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> regulatory and management programs.|$|E
25|$|Once removed, phosphorus, in {{the form}} of a phosphate-rich <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge,</b> may be dumped in a {{landfill}} or used as fertilizer. In the latter case, the treated <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> is also sometimes referred to as biosolids.|$|E
25|$|The term biosolids {{is used to}} {{differentiate}} treated <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> that can be beneficially recycled. Environmental advantages of <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> consist of, application of sludge to land due to its soil condition properties and nutrient content. Advantages also extend to reduction in adverse health effects of incineration, decreased chemical fertilizer dependency, diminishing greenhouse gas emissions deriving from incineration and reduction in incineration fuel and energy costs. Beneficial reuse of <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> is supported in EPA policies: the 1984 Beneficial Reuse Policy and the 1991 Inter-agency Policy on Beneficial Use of <b>Sewage</b> <b>Sludge,</b> with an objective to reduce volumes of waste generated. <b>Sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus but also contains significant numbers of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and eggs of parasitic worms. Sludge also contains more than trace amounts of organic and inorganic chemicals. Benefits of reusing <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> from use of organic and nutrient content in biosolids is valuable source in improving marginal lands and serving as supplements to fertilizers and soil conditioners. Extension of benefits of sludge on agriculture commodities include increase forest productivity, accelerated tree growth, re-vegetation of forest land previously devastated by natural disasters or construction activities. Also, <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> use to aid growth of final vegetative cap for municipal solid waste landfills is enormously beneficial. Opposing benefits of sludge water result from high levels of pathogenic organisms that can possibly contaminate soil, water, crops, livestock, and fish. Pathogens, metals, organic chemical content and odors are cause of major health, environmental and aesthetic factors. Sludge treatment processes reduce the level of pathogens which becomes important when applying sludge to land as well as distributing and marketing it. Pollutants of <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> come from domestic wastewater, discharge of industrial wastewater, municipal sewers and also from runoffs from parking lots, lawns and fields that were applied fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides.|$|E

40|$|<b>Sewage</b> <b>sludges</b> are {{residues}} {{resulting from}} the {{treatment of waste water}} released from various sources including homes, industries, medical facilities, street runoff and businesses. <b>Sewage</b> <b>sludges</b> contain nutrients and organic matter that can provide soil benefits and are widely used as soil amendments.

The mean concentration of the sum of the chlorobenzenes in the sludges was 43. 7 μg/kg, with a range of 7. 90 – 219 μg/kg. The five priority pollutants, i. e. 1, 4 -dichlorobenzene, 1, 3 -dichlorobenzene, 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene, hexachlorobenzene and 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene, were the most abundant. The concentrations of chlorinated benzenes generally decreased with increased chlorine substitution, although hexachlorobenzene and pentachlorobenzene were present at relatively high concentrations. 1, 4 -Dichlorobenzene and hexachlorobenzene increased over the period 1942 – 1961 in the sludges, whilst the other compounds analysed increased only from 1954 onwards.

25|$|Standards are set for <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> {{generated}} or {{treated by}} publicly owned and privately owned treatment works that treat domestic sewage and municipal wastewater. Materials flushed in household drains through sinks, toilets and tubs {{are referred to}} as domestic wastewater and include components of soaps, shampoos, human excrement, tissues, food particles, pesticides, hazardous waste, oil and grease. These domestic wastewaters are treated at the source in septic tanks, cesspools, portable toilets, or in publicly/privately owned wastewater treatment works. Alternately, municipal wastewater treatments consist of more levels of treatment that provide greater wastewater cleanup with larger amounts of <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge.</b> Primary municipal treatment remove solids that settle at the bottom, generating more than 3,000 liters of sludge per million liters of wastewater that is treated. Primary sludge water content is easily reduced by thickening or removing water and contains up to 7% solids. Secondary municipal treatment process produces <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> that is generated by biological treatment processes that include activated sludge systems, trickling filters, and other attached growth systems. Microbes are used to break down and convert organic substances in wastewater to microbial residue in biological treatment processes. This process removes up to 90% of organic matter and produces sludge that contains up to 2% solids and has increased generated volumes of sludge. Methods of use and disposal of <b>sewage</b> <b>sludge</b> include the following: Application of sludge to agricultural and non-agricultural lands; sale or give-away of sludge for use in home gardens; disposal of sludge in municipal landfills, sludge-only landfills, surface disposal sites and incineration of sludge.

40|$|Most biosolids {{produced}} at {{wastewater treatment plants}} in New Zealand, are currently put into landfills, were they can generate methane and produce leachate. Recent Government policy means that this disposal method cannot continue to be used and biosolids must be used beneficially. However, biosolids need to be stabilised before beneficial use. Using earthworms to break down organic wastes has gained momentum in the past decade. Earthworms and microorganisms {{can be used in}} the vermicomposting process to stabilise many organic materials including biosolids. This dissertation swnmarises information on vermicomposting obtained from a literature review and from visiting two large-scale commercial vermicomposting operations in Australia. Investigations assessed the potential of vermicomposting biosolids in New Zealand. Initially, the physical, chemical, and microbiological properties of three biosolids and four <b>sewage</b> <b>sludges</b> were measured. Worm acceptance of these materials were then determined. The four most promising materials from North Shore, Hamilton, Te Awamutu and Taupo were vermicomposted for 30 days using Eisenia fetida. The vermicasts produced were then evaluated in a glasshouse pot trial using ryegrass. The biosolids characterised had widely different properties compared to <b>sewage</b> <b>sludges</b> from waste stabilisation basins. Biosolids had more plant nutrients, greater pathogens numbers (as indicated by E. coli) and lower heavy metal concentrations than <b>sewage</b> <b>sludges.</b> Biosolids were initially toxic to worms due to ammoniwn concentrations and required stabilisation for 14 days before acceptance whereas <b>sewage</b> <b>sludges</b> were acceptable within two days if cellulose (as paper or cardboard) had been added. Vermicomposting these materials for 30 days produced vermicasts with lower volatile solids, higher C/N ratio, and significantly reduced indicator pathogen concentrations than the starting material. Ryegrass trials showed that mixing vermicasts with soil significantly increased plant growth, mostly because of the soluble N content. Trial results have shown that vermicomposting is an acceptable method for stabilising biosolids and produces a quality end product highly beneficial for land use...|$|R
