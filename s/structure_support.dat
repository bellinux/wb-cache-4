The surface of implants that contact the body might be made of a biomedical material such as titanium, silicone, or apatite depending on what is the most functional.

50|$|With this naming <b>structure,</b> <b>support</b> for {{mobility}} and multi-homing is inherent, if the properties for {{the names are}} chosen with care: application names are location-independent to allow an application to move around, node addresses are location-dependent but route-independent. PoA addresses are by nature route-dependent. Applying this naming scheme to RINA, with recursive layers, an interesting observation can be made: mapping application names to node addresses is the same mapping than mapping node addresses to PoAs. In other words, for any layer N, nodes at the layer N+1 are applications and nodes at the layer N-1 are points of attachment, making this relationship relative.|$|E

50|$|A {{distinctive}} architectural {{feature of}} the Gippsland campus was the Binishell. A Binishell is large reinforced concrete dome shaped and lifted by air pressure. Its inventor, architect Dr. Dante Bini, directed {{the construction of the}} Binishell in December 1979. Around 1,600 Binishells have been built in 17 countries. The eleven metre high binishell, using 300 tons of concrete and reinforcing steel, was inflated by a large membrane in around one hour, using Dr. Dante Bini's ferrocement method. The Binishell was used as a place for exams and graduations. However, due to its diminished structural integrity, during 2004 and early 2005 the building was not used for either of these purposes whilst a new <b>structure</b> <b>support</b> was installed.

50|$|In insects {{the central}} complex plays an {{important}} role in higher-order brain function. The neuropil in Drosophila Ellipsoid is composed of four substructures. Each section has been observed in several insects as well as the influence it has on behavior, however the exact function of this neuropil has proven elusive. Abnormal walking behavior and flight behavior are controlled primarily by the central complex and genetic mutations that disrupt the <b>structure</b> <b>support</b> the hypothesis that the central complex neuropil is a site of behavioral control. However, it is interesting that only specific components of the behavior were affected with the genetic mutations. For example, basic leg coordination of walking was normal, whereas speed, activity, and turning were affected. These observations suggest that the central complex not only plays a role in locomotor behavior, but fine tuning as well. There is also additional evidence that the neuropil may function in olfactory associative learning and memory.|$|E

50|$|The Makoko {{floating}} school comprises alternative sustainable {{buildings and}} structures designed {{to adapt to the}} resident communities' aquatic lifestyle. The floating school utilizes local materials such as bamboo, timber and resources to produce architecture that applies to the physical, social needs of people and reflects the culture of the community. Wood is used as the major material for the <b>structure,</b> <b>support</b> and finishing of school building.The form of the school building is a triangular A-Frame section with about 1,000-square-foot play area. The classrooms are located on the second tier and are partially enclosed with adjustable louvered slats. The classrooms are also surrounded by spatial public greenery. There is a playground below the classroom while the roof contains an additional open air classroom. The classroom spaces can be used for communal functions especially during out-of-school hours. Sustainable features include application of solar cells to the roof, rainwater catchment systems and composting toilets. The structure is also designed to use about 250 plastic barrels to float on the waters and be naturally ventilated and aerated. There are considerations to use the building prototype to provide additional infrastructure for the community including an entertainment center, a community hub and health clinics. The floating school design won the 2013 AR+D award for emerging architecture and was shortlisted for the London Design Museum's 2014 Design of the Year award. It also received a nomination for the 2015 International Award for Public Art.|$|E
