5000|$|In February 1944, the 2nd Division {{authorized}} {{the use of}} [...] "Assembly Ships" [...] (or [...] "Formation Ships") specially fitted to aid assembly of individual group formations. They were equipped with <b>signal</b> <b>lighting,</b> provision for quantity discharge of pyrotechnics, and were painted with distinctive group-specific high-contrast patterns of stripes, checkers or polka dots to enable easy recognition by their flock of bombers. The aircraft used in the first allocation were B-24Ds retired by the 44th, 93rd and 389th Groups. Arrangements for <b>signal</b> <b>lighting</b> varied from group to group, but generally consisted of white flashing lamps {{on both sides of}} the fuselage arranged to form the identification letter of the group. All armament and armor was removed and in some cases the tail turret. In the B-24Hs used for this purpose, the nose turret was removed and replaced by a [...] "carpetbagger" [...] type nose. Following incidents when flare guns were accidentally discharged inside the rear fuselage, some assembly (formation) ships had pyrotechnic guns fixed through the fuselage sides. As these aircraft normally returned to base once a formation had been established, a skeleton crew of two pilots, navigator, radio operator and one or two flare discharge operators were carried. In some groups an observer officer flew in the tail position to monitor the formation. These aircraft became known as Judas goats.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} model of light controlling {{light in a}} multi-atom cavity QED system consisting of three-level atoms confined in a cavity and interacting with a control laser from free space. A signal laser is coupled into the cavity and provides two output light channels: the transmitted <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> through the cavity and the reflected <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> from the cavity. We show that with the cavity electromagnetically induced transparency manifested by the free-space control light, the amplitude and the phase of the intra-cavity <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> can be manipulated by the free-space control laser. We analyze the cavity transmitted <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> and the cavity reflected <b>signal</b> <b>light,</b> and show that the two output channels of the <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> are complementary and the cavity-atom system is a versatile system for studies of alloptical switching and cross-phase modulation at low control intensities...|$|R

5000|$|Conventional traffic <b>signal</b> <b>lighting,</b> still {{common in}} some areas, {{utilizes}} a standard light bulb. Typically, a 67, 69, or 115 watt medium-base (household lamp in the US) light bulb provides the illumination. Light then bounces off a mirrored glass or polished aluminium reflector bowl, and {{out through a}} polycarbonate plastic or glass signal lens. In some signals, these lenses were cut to include a specific refracting pattern. Crouse-Hinds is one notable company for this practice. In the 1930s throughout the 1950s, they utilized a beaded prismatic lens with a [...] "smiley" [...] pattern embossed {{into the bottom of}} each lens.|$|E
50|$|One {{cardinal}} fact of {{our time}} is the momentous impact of Africa’s awakening upon the modern world. The flowing tide of African nationalism sweeps everything before it and constitutes {{a challenge to the}} colonial powers to make a just restitution for the years of injustice and crime committed against our continent.But Africa does not seek vengeance. It is against her very nature to harbor malice. Over two million of our people cry out with one voice of tremendous power. And what do they say? We do not ask for death for our oppressors; we do not pronounce wishes of ill-fate for our slave-masters; we make an assertion of a just and positive demand; our voice booms across the oceans and mountains, over the hills and valleys, in the desert places and through the vast expanse of mankind’s inhabitations, and it calls out for the freedom of Africa. Africa wants her freedom. Africa must be free. It is a simple call, but it’s also a <b>signal</b> <b>lighting</b> a red warning to those who would tend to ignore it.|$|E

Results indicate that newer rear signaling designs can be very effective at drawing drivers’ eyes back to the forward roadway, and that flashing and brightness are two important signal properties moderating effectiveness (attention-getting). Remarkable performance gains can be achieved via use of LED signal approaches which both flash and increase signal intensity or lamp brightness...|$|E
40|$|Road {{agencies}} face growing {{pressure to}} respond to a range of issues associated with climate change and the reliance on fossil fuels. A key part of this response will be to reduce the dependency on fossil fuel based energy (and the associated greenhouse gas emissions) of transport, both vehicles and infrastructure. This paper presents findings of investigations into three key areas of innovative technologies and processes, namely the inclusion of onsite renewable energy generation technologies as part of road and transport infrastructure, the potential for automated motorways to reduce traffic fuel consumption (referred to as 'Smart Roads'), and the reduction of energy demand from route and <b>signal</b> <b>lighting.</b> The paper then concludes with the recommendation for the engineering profession to embrace sustainability performance assessment and rating tools as the basis for enhancing and communicating the contribution to Australia's response to climate change. Such tools provide a rigorous structure that can standardise approaches to key issues across entire sectors and provide clarity on the evidence required to demonstrate leading performance.

40|$|Decreased {{packaging}} cost and improved performance have helped LEDs gain acceptance as light sources in automotive {{applications such as}} <b>signal</b> <b>lighting.</b> An assembly technique is described that allows the creation of thin taillamps that can be customized {{to conform to the}} shape of a particular vehicle. Because of developments in high-brightness LED materials and high-power LED packaging, LEDs are more frequently being used in automotive signal lamps. A new product, HP SnapLED, combines the latest LED technol-ogy with a three-dimensional assembly technique to create a thin taillamp that conforms to the shape of the vehicle (see Figure 1). Background The first LED signal lamp appeared on a passenger vehicle in 1985. The 1986 Nissan 300 ZX center high mounted stop lamp (CHMSL) used 72 absorbing substrate AlGaAs, 5 -mm LEDs assembled on a printed circuit board. From this start, LEDs have gained acceptance in the automotive industry because of a decrease in the cost of LED light sources. These cost reductions have come from an increase in the performance of the LEDs, which results in a {{reduction in the number of}} LEDs required for a function. As the number of LEDs required goes down, LED {{packaging cost}} and assembly cost are proportionally reduced. Figure 2 shows the number of LEDs required to meet the CHMSL specification from 1985 to 1997. The main factors that have contributed to the increased performance of LEDs are more efficient LED materials (see Figure 3) and improved LED packaging. Since their introduction into automotive applications, LED efficiency has increased over 500 %. In 1994, HP introduced a new LED package designed specifically for automotive lighting. This new package, called SuperFlux, was An automotive product development manager at the HP Optoelectronics Division, James Stewart is responsible for elec-tronic packaging and automotive lighting.

Traffic congestion wastes a huge portion of the national income for fuel and traffic-related environmental and socioeconomic problems. Computer simulation is a powerful tool for analyzing complex and dynamic scenarios. It provides an appealing approach to analyze repetitive processes. Simulation helps decision makers identify different possible options by analyzing enormous amounts of data. Hence, computer simulation can be used effectively to analyze traffic flow patterns and <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing. This paper discusses a special-purpose simulation (SPS) tool for optimize traffic <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> timing.
