Pyranine was embedded in kappa(-) carrageenan {{and used as}} a fluorescence probe. Scattered light intensities, I-SC and fluorescence intensities, I were monitored during the drying and swelling Of kappa(-) carrageenan gels. {{it was observed that}} the fluorescence intensity decreased linearly as drying time was increased. A simple model consisting of Case II diffusion was used to quantify the drying processes of the kappa(-) carrageenan gels. This moving boundary model provided packing constant, kappa(o). During swelling, fluorescence intensity increased exponentially as time is increased. The increase in I, was modeled using Li-Tanaka equation from which swelling time constants, tau(c) and cooperative diffusion coefficients, D-c were determined. It was observed that swelling time constants, tau(c) decreased and diffusion coefficients, D-c increased as the swelling temperature was increased. Activation energies for drying and swelling were also obtained and found to be 53. 9 and 47. 2 kJ mol(- 1), respectively. Publisher's Versio...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} thrombus degrading {{effect of}} a fibrinolytic enzyme from food origin Stenotrophomonas sp. of Indonesia. Methods. Prior to animal study, the enzyme safety was tested using cell culture. The effect on expression of tissue plasminogen activator was also analysed in the cell culture. For in vivo studies, 25 Wistar rats were used: normal control, negative control, treatment groups with crude and semipurified enzyme given orally at 25 [*]mg/kg, and positive control group which received Lumbrokinase at 25 [*]mg/kg. Blood clot in the tail was induced by <b>kappa</b> <b>carrageenan</b> injection at 1 [*]mg/kg BW. Results. Experiment with cell culture confirmed the enzyme safety at the concentration used and increased expression of tPA. Decreasing of thrombus was observed in the positive group down to 70. 35 ± 23. 11 % of the negative control animals (100 %). The thrombus observed in the crude enzyme treatment was down to 56. 99 ± 15. 95 % and 71. 5 ± 15. 7 % for semipurified enzyme. Scanning electron microscopy showed clearly that bood clots {{were found in the}} animals injected with kappa carrageenan; however, in the treatment and positive groups, the clot was much reduced. Conclusions. Oral treatment of enzyme from Stenotrophomonas sp. of Indonesian fermented food was capable of degrading thrombus induced in Wistar rats...|$|R
