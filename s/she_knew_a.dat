25|$|In {{contrast}} to her linguistic abilities, Genie's nonverbal communication continued to excel. She invented her own system of gestures and pantomimed certain words {{as she said}} them, and also acted out events which she could not express in language. Initially she would only draw pictures if someone asked her to, but during her stay with the Riglers she began to use drawings to communicate if she could not explain something in words. In addition to her own drawings she often used pictures from magazines to relate to daily experiences, and for reasons the scientists never determined especially did so after encountering things that frightened her. Some time during mid-1972 Marilyn observed that a magazine picture of a wolf sent Genie into a terror, after which the Riglers asked Genie's mother if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> possible cause for this reaction; she then informed them {{that her husband had}} acted like a dog to intimidate Genie, making the underlying reason for her fear apparent to the scientists for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|Mentalist Mark Edward relates from {{personal}} experience as a [...] "psychic performer" [...] how powerful a hit can be when someone in a large audience [...] "claims" [...] a phrase such as a [...] "clown in a graveyard" [...] statement. Edward describes a mental image of a clown placing flowers on graves and adds, [...] "Does that mean anything to someone... whereupon a woman stands up and claims that he is speaking directly to her. She remembers it as Edward specifically stating that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> man who dressed as a clown and placed flowers on graves in her hometown. Edward reports that it took some convincing {{to get her to}} understand that he was not directly talking to her, but had thrown the statement out to the entire audience of 300 people. She made the connection, and because it seemed so personal and the situation so odd she felt that he was talking to her directly.|$|E

6000|$|... "Very little indeed," [...] {{answered}} Tuppence, and {{was pleased}} to note that Whittington's uneasiness was augmented instead of allayed. To have boasted that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> lot might have raised doubts in his mind.|$|E

60|$|Therefore, whenever, to-night, {{she noted}} groups congregated in corners, and conversations being {{obviously}} carried on in whispers, she boldly approached and {{joined in the}} gossip, depositing a poisoned shaft here and there with great cleverness, all the more easily as it was generally supposed that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> great deal more than she cared to say.|$|E
60|$|Despite his own {{superior}} {{point of}} view, {{he had an}} idea that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>a</b> lot, and he experienced a fleeting feeling {{like that of a}} barbarian {{face to face with the}} evidence of some tremendous culture.

60|$|Already Mrs Verloc {{was regretting}} her words. They had sounded more unkind than she meant them to be. They had also the unwisdom of {{unnecessary}} things.

60|$|She {{looked across}} the silent fields to the west.
