The system is developed in consideration of part localization and modular clamping functions, and independent of CNC machine tools for the convenience of application. And then, a model-based collision detecting algorithm is designed, which can be implemented by comparing the cutter's actual position extracted by ultrasonic sensors, and the calibrated positions of clamping points. Finally, a modular fixture <b>system</b> <b>with</b> automatic collision <b>avoidance</b> was manufactured and tested. From machining experiments, it indicates that the proposed fixture system can be highly efficient and very flexible to meet the aircraft structural parts machining requirements...|$|R

By combining a novel vehicle-tracking and detection algorithm with our path-planner for autonomous navigation, {{it was possible for}} a tracked Logistics Armoured Ambulance Carrier to follow a multi purpose vehicle in an equatorial jungle where few non-paved roads and markers exist. With this new approach, vehicle following performance is enhanced and vehicle safety ensured. Field trials performed in tropical jungle conditions have demonstrated the validity of the approach; results from the field works are included and discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a Fuzzy-based {{adaptive cruise control}} <b>system</b> <b>with</b> collision <b>avoidance</b> and collision warning (ACC/CA/CW). The proposed control scheme aims to improve driver's comfort while keeping him/her safe by avoiding possible collisions. Depending on inputs from both the driver and the installed sensors, the controller accelerates/decelerates the vehicle to keep its speed at the desired limit. In case of a possible collision, the controller decelerates (accelerates) the vehicle to prevent possible crash with the vehicle ahead (behind). Moreover, the controller issues visual and/or audio alerts for the driver in order to warn him/her in case {{of the need for}} applying an uncomfortable deceleration level and/or to warn the driver for risky situations where he/she might need to change the lane. Simulation results illustrate the robustness of the proposed system over various ranges of inputs...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{navigation}} {{control of}} multi-agent systems is studied. In particular, the problem statement {{is based on}} the application of multi-agent systems' techniques to the control of dual arm robotic manipulators. The thesis is divided into two separate subproblems: the rst one considers decentralized navigation control of a non-holonomic two-agent <b>system</b> <b>with</b> collision <b>avoidance,</b> corresponding to the end eectors of the robotic arms. For this problem, two controllers were found for which the analysis showed stability and convergence to an arbitrarily small region around the desired destinations. The second subproblem considers decentralized connectivity pre- serving control of a holonomic multi-agent system of ngers associated with the end eectors. Here, the goal was to modify the existing the- ory of connectivity constraints to account for the angle constraints that are necessary to describe the relationship between ngers connected to the same hand. For this case, both connectivity and convergence was shown with the new connectivity controller...|$|R

We describe a novel Z/O-oriented IPC facility that combines the emulated copy data passing scheme for monolithic <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> new copy <b>avoidance</b> techniques for microkernel systems. Unlike previous optimizations, I/O-oriented IPC does not re-quire changes in existing user applications or complex re-structuring of servers; it offers an API with copy semantics {{and allows the}} same servers to be installed at kernel or user level. In end-to-end experiments on an ATM network at 512 Mbps, I/O-oriented IPC gave user-level protocol servers performance approaching that of kernel-level ones. Perfor-mance differences scaled roughly inversely to the processor% SPECint 95 rating, projecting fast further improvement. I...|$|R

40|$|Autonomous {{navigation}} for unmanned surface vessels is {{a modern}} and rapidly growing ﬁeld of research. In recent years, many concepts and solutions have been proposed {{in order to achieve}} autonomous control of marine vessels. This thesis reviews the development of an autonomous path-planning and -following <b>system</b> <b>with</b> obstacle <b>avoidance</b> to avoid collisions, for a model-scale surface vessel. The system was developed to be able to navigate in a global or locally known map of static obstacles, where there were uncertainties regrading unknown static and dynamic obstacle present in the area of operation. A LIDAR was used as a proximity sensor, in order for the system to sense the environment and to map the dynamic obstacles {{in the vicinity of the}} vessel, and in addition perform simultaneously localization and mapping. This information was used by the collision avoidance system in order to avoid obstacles. The autonomous path planner used in this thesis is a slightly modiﬁed version of the A* algorithm, that generates a path towards a set goal. In order to follow the path, a Line of Sight steering law has been implemented, that has been modiﬁed for use on an omnidirectional vessel. A modiﬁed version of the Dynamic Window algorithm has been developed and implemented, to enable the vessel to avoid dynamic obstacles that is met along the path. The system was designed for use on the omnidirectional vessel named the CS Saucer, which was used as the platform to test the resulting system in the NTNU Marine Cybernetics Laboratory. The experiments and computer simulations showed that the collision avoidance system could handle static obstacles very well. The collision avoidance system was also shown to handle dynamic obstacles, but there were some limitations to the system in this regards. This was mainly due to the dynamic obstacles velocity not being estimated and compensated for. This should be the main focus of further work, as well as using the obstacle velocity information to make the collision avoidance system abide the International Regulations for Avoiding Collision at Sea (COLREGS) ...|$|R

Extraversion was positively related to both seeking social support and avoidance coping. As expected, avoidance coping was positively associated with psychological distress.
