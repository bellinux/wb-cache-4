Secale sylvestre is, therefore, the most ancient Secale species. Following separation of S. sylvestre from other taxa of the genus, perennial taxa also separated.

50|$|A useful {{molecular}} marker {{known as a}} <b>simple</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>repeat</b> (SSR) is used in breeding with respect to selection. SSRs are segments of a genome composed of tandem repeats of a short sequence of nucleotides, usually two to six base pairs. They are popular tools in genetics and breeding because of their relative abundance compared to other marker types, {{a high degree of}} polymorphism (number of variants), and easy assaying by polymerase chain reaction. However, they are expensive to identify and develop. Comparative genome mapping has revealed a high degree of similarity in terms of sequence colinearity between closely related crop species. This allows the exchange of such markers within a group of related species, such as wheat, rye and triticale. One study established a 58% and 39% transferability rate to triticale from wheat and rye, respectively. Transferability refers to the phenomenon where the sequence of DNA nucleotides flanking the SSR locus (position on the chromosome) is sufficiently homologous (similar) between genomes of closely related species. Thus, DNA primers (a generally short sequence of nucleotides are used to direct a copying reaction during PCR) designed for one species can be used to detect SSRs in related species. SSR markers are available in wheat and rye, but very few, if any, are available for triticale.|$|E

In order to assess the genetic relation, DNA from thirteen capsicum cultivars were screened using inter <b>simple</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>repeat</b> (ISSR) and microsatellite (SSR) markers. Five ISSR primers amplified 204 reproducible bands of which 139 were polymorphic. The percentage of polymorphic bands detected by ISSR was 100 %. The highest polymorphic bands obtained by the use of primers UBC- 809 (34) and UBC- 66 (53). A total of 1 - 5 alleles were detected by six SSR primers, with an average of two alleles per primer. The number of alleles per locus ranged one (ssrCAMS- 811) to five (ssrCAMS- 142). The polymorphism information content (PIC) values ranged from 0. 27 (ssrCAMS- 405) to 0. 67 (ssrCAMS- 142).

40|$|<b>Simple</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>repeats</b> (SSRs, or microsatellites) {{have been}} {{constantly}} gaining importance as single-locus DNA markers in population genetics and behavioural ecology.

In the first step, parts of a genome are randomly amplified with arbitrary 10 mer primers using RAPD fingerprinting. Labelled SSR- oligonucleotides serve as probes to detect complementary sequences in RAPD products by means of Southern analyses. Subsequently, positive RAPD fragments of suitable size are cloned and sequenced. Using GA and GT probes, we applied this approach to waterfleas (Daphnia) and revealed 37 hybridization signals in 20 RAPD profiles.
