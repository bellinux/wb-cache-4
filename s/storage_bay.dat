500|$|Speculation that La Ronde {{would be}} {{building}} a new roller coaster began {{in the second half}} of 2004. Rumors that the roller coaster would be manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard emerged in September 2005. Construction for the roller coaster by Martin & Vleminckx began in September 2005 with land clearing and foundation pouring. The $18.7 million Goliath was announced on October 26, 2005. By mid-November, the <b>storage</b> <b>bay</b> was constructed with track pieces for the brake run and station being installed soon after. Construction on the lift hill continued throughout December and was topped off (the highest piece the lift hill) on December 21. The first drop was completed by mid-January 2006 followed by the first camelback hill which was completed by the end of February. After the second and third camelback hills were installed, the turnaround was completed in mid-March. The three camelback hills and banked turns leading back to the station were installed by the end of March marking the completion of installing track. The cars for the trains were also delivered in late March. After the cars were put on the track in April, testing began. [...] Once testing was complete, Goliath opened to the public on May 13, 2006.|$|E
50|$|Alone in the <b>storage</b> <b>bay,</b> Baltar and Roslin {{come back}} closer together. They {{realize that they}} finally {{have more in common}} than it seemed all along. Roslin finally makes it off the Galactica with Tyrol's help; Gaeta however orders their Raptor to be destroyed. Saul Tigh and Admiral Adama defend the <b>storage</b> <b>bay</b> from where the Raptor took off, only to be {{attacked}} by rebel marines. Both Tigh and Adama's as well as the Raptor's fate remain uncertain {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
50|$|The VMAX has 1 to 10 storage bays {{for hard}} drives. Each <b>storage</b> <b>bay</b> {{contains}} 16 Disk Array Enclosures (DAE). Each DAE contains 15-25 hard drives. VMAX supports SATA, Fiber Channel, SAS and Solid State drives.|$|E
25|$|Ammunition was {{stored in}} nearby bunkers, and was {{manually}} {{transferred from the}} bunkers, via concrete footpaths, to smaller concrete <b>storage</b> <b>bays</b> at the guns.|$|R
50|$|As {{originally}} constructed, Galacticas hangars contained overhead <b>storage</b> <b>bays</b> for its Vipers. These bays {{were eventually}} removed sometime before {{the close of}} the First Cylon War.|$|R
50|$|Gun no. 3 was {{positioned}} {{on top of}} a concrete platform. The ammunition bunkers are not in close proximity to this platform, so extra <b>storage</b> <b>bays</b> were built below the platform.|$|R
5000|$|The aft <b>storage</b> <b>bay,</b> {{behind the}} crew couches. This housed the 70 mm camera equipment, the astronaut’s garments, tool sets, storage bags, a fire extinguisher, CO2 absorbers, sleep {{restraint}} ropes, spacesuit maintenance kits, 16mm camera equipment, and the contingency lunar sample container.|$|E
50|$|EMC Symmetrix VMAX {{systems are}} storage {{platforms}} intended for open systems and mainframe computing. Symmetrix VMAX systems run the Enginuity operating environment.The system scales {{from a single}} Symmetrix VMAX Engine system with one <b>storage</b> <b>bay</b> to a large eight-engine system with a maximum of ten storage bays.|$|E
50|$|Pod Bay Deck: Along {{with the}} Pod Bay, the Pod Bay Deck also {{features}} an emergency airlock, circuitry <b>storage</b> <b>bay,</b> two fresh water tanks, a maintenance equipment room, an emergency shelter and space suit rack, emergency batteries for the centrifuge and pod bay, and a zero-g toilet.|$|E
50|$|Like Whites Ferry, a granary {{was built}} here, having three <b>storage</b> <b>bays,</b> two passageways for the boats, {{and only one}} story. The remains of the granary are next to the parking lot.|$|R
50|$|The VMAX system bay {{can hold}} 1-8 engines. These engines house the {{hardware}} {{for all the}} data processing capabilities. Each engine contains 2 director boards, memory chips, and front-end (FE) and back-end (BE) ports for connectivity to hosts and <b>storage</b> <b>bays,</b> respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was closed}} {{after the war}} and today there is little evidence remaining of the facility. Houses have been built along much of the former runway area. The rest is overgrown and abandoned. Some wartime debris litter the area. Bomb <b>storage</b> <b>bays</b> are visible from the road.|$|R
50|$|The Montague Street (northern) {{elevation}} has {{single or}} paired windows under segmental arches; a large stone plaque {{sits in a}} recess above the centre windows. At ground-floor level there is another pale stone plaque, a broad segment-arched window, an original wooden entrance door and another wooden door leading to a <b>storage</b> <b>bay.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Recent work {{includes}} [...] "Spectrum Divide", a {{solo show}} at Saamlung Gallery, [...] "Sonic Furnace" [...] {{featured in the}} Get It Louder Biennial, Shanghai in 2010, [...] "People's Power Station" [...] at the Chengdu Biennale in 2011 and [...] "Laoban Soundsystem: Infinite Baffle" [...] at a cargo container <b>storage</b> <b>bay</b> in Hong Kong.|$|E
5000|$|The Darlington Waste Management Facility {{provides}} {{dry storage}} for the used fuel from Darlington, {{after an initial}} period in a water-filled <b>storage</b> <b>bay.</b> The facility was opened in 2007, reportedly on schedule and on budget. [...] The Nuclear Waste Management Organization is seeking a site in Canada for a permanent repository for used fuel from all of Canada's nuclear reactors.|$|E
5000|$|Southeast Vermont Transit's [...] "Current" [...] bus {{facility}} {{is located in}} Rockingham, Vermont, close to US Route 5's interchange with Interstate 91, {{directly across the street}} from the Exit 6 Park and Ride lot. Housed there is a 20000 sq ft building consisting of bus <b>storage</b> <b>bays,</b> offices and a maintenance center.|$|R
50|$|The cellars {{are below}} the main range but are {{considered}} part of the service facilities and as such are included here. The cellars comprise fairly large well lit rooms {{on the north side of}} the house. The cellars were first accessed via the staircase at the eastern side of the kitchen fireplace. The main parts of the cellar were supplemented by storage areas to the south, some of which are vaulted and include brick built <b>storage</b> <b>bays.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike in {{the base}} game, the {{expansion}} now removes the need for players to earn enough prestige to put down their first store, instead allowing players to put down small-sized stores {{from the start of}} a new game. However, different store types at varying sizes require the player to now provide certain services to ensure that the tenant that occupies them is satisfied greatly. Such services include providing mall security staff, and the addition of demonstration booths to perk up customer numbers; players can even build observation decks on the higher levels of a tower to attract more visitors to their high-rise building. In addition, players can now lay down the foundation for expansive stores, build larger fountains and also build large <b>storage</b> <b>bays,</b> with each capable of allowing the player to establish 15 stores between them, unlike the smaller <b>storage</b> <b>bays.</b> Furthermore, players have access to fifteen new types of stores and restaurants, and can now also provide additional transit options for visitors to use; while the base game allowed players to build a metro station, they can now also include a bus station outside the tower building, and a railroad station, within the plot of their high-rise.|$|R
50|$|According {{to the one}} Japanese Comic Bom Bom article Metroplex is 800 meters tall.In the Marvel U.K. Transformers comic {{however it}} says he is 698 feet (212.8 meters) tall. He can lift 70,000 tons. His armor is the equal of any Transformer's; to merely scratch it would require at least a low-yield nuclear explosion. He has left shoulder-mounted twin high-energy MASER (microwave {{amplification}} through stimulated emission of radiation) cannons and a retractable omnidirectional receiving and transmitting rod antenna in his right shoulder. His chest module contains a <b>storage</b> <b>bay</b> capable of holding a mid-size vehicle. In Autobot City mode, he has a helipad and ramps leading to the <b>storage</b> <b>bay</b> and various repair bays. Although {{it is a common}} misconception that Metroplex is unable to fly, Metroplex was depicted as being able to fly in robot mode in the final episode of the Japanese exclusive Headmasters series {{as well as in the}} IDW comics.|$|E
50|$|The case {{represented}} {{a significant departure from}} previous Atari consumer product designs, dispensing with aesthetics of earlier Atari consoles. Faux wood grain inlays and mechanical throw switches {{were replaced by}} a sleek, dark brown wedge with indented. touch sensitive switches. The casing featured a hinge-topped <b>storage</b> <b>bay</b> for the wireless controllers and a built-in belly groove for winding excess cable to connect to a TV.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>storage</b> <b>bay,</b> Worf is hit by {{a barrel}} that falls from above. His spine is damaged, {{resulting}} in paraplegia. Dr. Crusher consults a specialist, Dr. Russell, who suggests a risky, possibly life-threatening, experimental, untested procedure that may allow Worf to regain all mobility; essentially, they clone his spine, extract the original {{and replace it with}} the new one. However Dr. Crusher does not think the risk is worth it.|$|E
5000|$|St Cuthbert's Limeworks are shown, but {{not named}} as such, on Map 1, the OS map {{surveyed}} in 1860. These works are collectively labelled [...] "Lime Works" [...] and are individually labelled as [...] "Well", [...] "Smithy", [...] "Limekiln" [...] and [...] "Limekilns". The standard {{work on the}} waggonways argues that the zigzag structure labelled [...] "Limekilns" [...] were not kilns at all, but <b>storage</b> <b>bays</b> for finished and semi-finished product where lime could be slaked. The building labelled [...] "Old Walls" [...] {{was not part of}} the works. The active kilns consisted of the two [...] "pots" [...] labelled [...] "Limekiln".|$|R
50|$|Reliability and {{performance}} {{is the key}} for any storage server. StorTrends iTX 2.8 is designed to support <b>Storage</b> Bridge <b>Bay</b> specification that provide Auto-Failover capability to ensure that any interruption is handled without affecting data. It supports High-availability cluster, redundancy, scalability, replication, disaster recovery and multiple site backups.|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy {{awarded a}} privatized {{contract}} to Foster Wheeler Environmental Corporation in May 2000 for the design, licensing, construction {{and operation of}} a spent nuclear fuel repackaging and storage facility. The Foster Wheeler Environmental Team consists of Foster Wheeler Environmental Corp. (the primary contractor), Alstec, RWE-Nukem, RIO Technical Services, Winston and Strawn, and Utility Engineering. The Idaho Spent Fuel (ISF) facility {{is an integral part}} of the DOE-EM approach to accelerating SNF disposition at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). Construction of this facility is also important in helping DOE to meet the provisions of the Idaho Settlement Agreement. The ISF Facility is a substantial facility with heavy shielding walls in the repackaging and <b>storage</b> <b>bays</b> and state-of-the-art features required to meet the provisions of 10 CFR 72 requirements. The facility is designed for a 40 -year life...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} and store the second train {{when it was}} not being used, Holiday World added a transfer track to the ride just after the 180° turn out of the station. A transfer track allows {{a portion of the}} track to be moved and redirected to a <b>storage</b> <b>bay.</b> This allows an unused train to be stored during normal operation and also provides an additional area for maintenance crews to inspect the roller coaster train.|$|E
5000|$|The ship is in a {{constant}} state of deterioration and frequent system malfunctions (for example, an irreparable radiation leak, their cargo of intelligent talking bombs lowering from their bomb bay without a command to do so, an explosion destroying their sleeping quarters, the food processing computer repeatedly serving chicken-flavored liquid meals, and a <b>storage</b> <b>bay</b> [...] "self destructing" [...] and destroying the ship's entire supply of toilet paper), and only the soft-spoken female voice of the ship's computer for company.|$|E
50|$|The front {{loading door}} was welded shut and an {{additional}} deck installed above the tank <b>storage</b> <b>bay</b> to provide a mounting for the rocket launching racks. The resulting storage space below the deck (formerly the tank deck) {{was used as a}} magazine for storage of rockets, with up to 5,000 being able to be carried. The craft was also fitted with a Type 970 radar set whose primary use was for rangefinding, but was also successfully used for navigation. Generally propulsion was provided by Paxman diesel engines, however, others were used due to availability. Some U.S. craft were fitted with petrol (gasoline) engines.|$|E
40|$|Some oil mills, {{among the}} most {{representative}} in the Puglia Region in terms of quality and productivity have been considered, and the temperature and humidity {{of the environment and}} the sensations of temperature felt by the workers were registered inside them during the process of oil extraction. Subsequently, a numerical code in MATLAB language was created, able to calculate the PMV and PPD and a study was carried out of the conditions of global comfort in the environment during the oil extraction process. The results of the surveys carried out in the mills show the importance of microclimate risk analysis in these workplaces, since the instrumental surveys and the calculations have shown that climatic conditions are not comfortable in the olive <b>storage</b> <b>bays.</b> On the other hand, the data from the oil extraction areas shows an acceptable condition of thermal well-being...|$|R
2500|$|Usually stone built, British bank barns are {{rectangular}} buildings. They {{usually have}} a central threshing area with hay or corn (cereal) <b>storage</b> <b>bays</b> on either side on the upper floor; and byres, stables, cartshed or other rooms below. The threshing barn on the upper floor was entered by double doors in the long wall approached from a raised bank: these banks could be artificially created. [...] Opposite the main doors was a small winnowing door which opened high above the farmyard level. A common arrangement had an open-fronted single bay cartshed below the threshing floor, with stables {{on one side and}} a cow-house on the other. [...] The entrances to these lower floor rooms were protected from above in many cases by a continuous canopy or pentise carried on timber or stone beams which are cantilevered from the main wall. Brick-built bank barns are less common.|$|R
5000|$|In 1853, W B Lead began {{driving the}} Park Level Mine, which {{eventually}} intersected 11 mineral veins. As the mine developed, {{so did the}} surface workings. In 1858, a [...] "mineshop" [...] was built to accommodate the miners; the population density in such a remote area was very low and, until then, miners had been faced with a long daily walk {{to and from the}} mine. In 1862, <b>storage</b> <b>bays</b> ("bouse teams") were constructed, to store the raw lead ore (the [...] "bouse"), and washing rakes were installed, in which water was used to separate the lead ore in the bouse from the waste material. In 1878, soon after the mine struck the richest of the veins, the Park Level Mill was brought into operation, to speed up the process of washing the ore. The main feature of the mill was a large waterwheel, the [...] "Killhope Wheel".|$|R
50|$|Forklifts are a {{critical}} element of warehouses and distribution centers. It’s imperative that these structures {{be designed to}} accommodate their efficient and safe movement. In the case of Drive-In/Drive-Thru Racking, a forklift needs to travel inside a <b>storage</b> <b>bay</b> that is multiple pallet positions deep to place or retrieve a pallet. Often, forklift drivers are guided into the bay through guide rails {{on the floor and}} the pallet is placed on cantilevered arms or rails. These maneuvers require well-trained operators. Since every pallet requires the truck to enter the storage structure, damage is more common than with other types of storage. In designing a drive-in system, dimensions of the fork truck, including overall width and mast width, must be carefully considered.|$|E
50|$|Rebel crew imprison Samuel Anders, {{as well as}} Karl Agathon and {{his wife}} Sharon Agathon, and their child, Hera Agathon, {{together}} with Caprica Six in a brig cell. In the CIC, Admiral Adama and Saul Tigh are taken hostage {{and sent to the}} brig as well. Adama and Tigh manage to overwhelm their captors and break free. Lee Adama and Capt. Thrace help President Laura Roslin (who has decided to {{take an active role in}} government again) meet with Gaius Baltar in order for her to use Baltar's wireless transmitter to address the fleet and bring the people back into order; afterwards they join up by coincidence with Admiral Adama and Tigh. Together they make their way to <b>Storage</b> <b>Bay</b> Two, from where Galen Tyrol has promised to take the Admiral and the President into safety onto the rebel Cylon basestar.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, with Sisko's absence, Eddington takes {{command and}} orders the senior crew to prepare {{transport}} of the replicators to an inbound Vulcan craft. Major Kira {{walks into the}} <b>storage</b> <b>bay</b> where Eddington is alone with the replicators, and he knocks her unconscious, revealing himself {{to be with the}} Maquis. Eddington transports himself and the replicators to a waiting ship and flees the station. Eddington later contacts Sisko to reveal his alliances and that the Maquis are only at conflict with Cardassian, though promise further trouble if the Federation aids them. Sisko vows to capture and arrest Eddington himself. Later, Yates returns to the station alone, having dropped her crew in the Maquis Badlands as to turn herself in, believing this was what Sisko wanted. She tells Sisko that she had intended no harm and only felt a duty to aid the Maquis. Sisko and Yates have an emotional embrace before she is taken off to the brig.|$|E
50|$|Rio {{woke up in}} the afternoon. Someone {{tried to}} unlock the door to the <b>storage</b> room. <b>Bay</b> and Fen hid in the back closet and locked it from the inside. Nevio and an Above Council member arrived. The temple bats, were brought Above and into the storage room. Nevio opened the closet, and dumped a dead Ciro and temple bat inside.|$|R
500|$|Following the landing, the 59thEngineer Company {{constructed}} logistics {{facilities in}} the Arawe area. Due to the Japanese air raids, priority {{was given to the}} construction of a partially underground evacuation hospital, which was completed in January 1944. The underground hospital was replaced with a 120-bed above-ground facility in April 1944. Pilelo Island was selected for the site of the PT boat facilities, and a pier for refueling the boats and dispersed fuel <b>storage</b> <b>bays</b> were built there.
