60|$|Already she mocked {{at herself}} for her dreams. They could be {{fulfilled}} easily enough. But she recognised too well, in her spirit, the mockery {{of her own}} impulses. What did <b>she</b> <b>care,</b> that Gerald had created a richly-paying industry out of an old worn-out concern? What did <b>she</b> <b>care?</b> The worn-out concern and the rapid, splendidly organised industry, they were bad money. Yet of course, <b>she</b> <b>cared</b> a great deal, outwardly--and outwardly was all that mattered, for inwardly was a bad joke.|$|R

5|$|Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{performs}} a one-man show on Broadway {{so that he}} can be considered for a Tony Award as part of his EGOT quest. His show receives positive reviews, and Tracy is convinced that he will win a Tony, but Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells him that in order for him to qualify for the award he must do his one-man show eight times, which worries Tracy, as he is unable to perform anything the same way twice. Despite initial reluctance to help him, Jenna eventually agrees to coach Tracy in the principles of acting, but this leads nowhere, resulting in the two arguing and Jenna telling him he can go on his show and read the phone book for all <b>she</b> <b>cares.</b> At the end of the episode, Tracy does read the phone book at his show, making Jenna very proud of him, and inexplicably drawing high praise from the audience.|$|E

5|$|Generally, Banai's {{birth is}} not {{discussed}} in the folk songs. Few regard her as an avatar of the apsara (celestial nymph) Rambha, while others consider her {{as one of the}} seven daughters of Indra, the king of the gods. She is found by a Dhangar in a golden box in the forest, hidden in a termite mound or a pit. Her Dhangar father (sometimes named Yamu) is the chief of shepherds, who owns nine lakh sheep and goats, nine lakh lambs and numerous barren ones. Yamu is said to have prayed for a child and finds Banai in a box. A virgin ewe is said to have fed Banai her milk, as Yamu does not have a wife and does not know how to feed the infant. In another miracle, a three-storeyed house appears at the place of Yamu's tent for the young Banai to reside, {{while the rest of the}} Dhangars live in tents. She grows up as a rich shepherdess and becomes the overseer of twelve Dhangar vadas (pastoral settlements or camps, inhabited by different Dhangar clans). <b>She</b> <b>cares</b> for her sheep, grazes them and learns how to breed them.|$|E

5|$|Elsa, {{princess of}} Arendelle and heiress to the throne, is {{born with the}} ability to create and control ice and snow. As a child, she uses her {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland to play in with her younger sister and best friend, Princess Anna. One night, Elsa accidentally harms Anna with her powers. The king and queen of Arendelle hurriedly take Anna to a tribe of mountain trolls to be healed. While healing Anna, the trolls inform the royals present that Elsa's abilities will grow, becoming both beautiful and very dangerous so she must learn to control them. While the trolls erase Anna's memory of the incident and of her elder sister's powers in general, Elsa is traumatized by the event. The king and queen take steps to control and hide Elsa's ice powers: the castle gates are locked, Elsa is shut away in her bedroom for most of the time, she is given gloves to help suppress her powers and is told to hold in her emotions as well. Nonetheless her powers continue to grow even stronger and so she becomes fearful of harming those <b>she</b> <b>cares</b> about most. Meanwhile, her sister Anna is less happy and confused by the loss of contact with her elder sister and tries, without success, to coax her out of her room. When the sisters grow into teenagers, the ship in which the king and queen are sailing is capsized in a storm and they drown, leaving Anna and Elsa feeling even more lonely.|$|E

He angrily {{declares}} that her absence is to blame for the current state of his life, declaring that he is the reason Phil has left due to his homosexuality, but Kathy tells him that she and Phil knew that he was gay before he even started school, and that they have always loved him.

Gavin meets Kathy in Walford and reveals that he has kidnapped Phil and threatens to kill him if she does not follow his instructions and give him money. Kathy and Ben reluctantly agree to give into Gavin's demands, but after trying to steal Ian's safe, Kathy decides not to do so. Ian later tells Kathy that her grandson Bobby Beale (Elliot Carrington) killed Lucy. Kathy, after seeing Ben drunk and angry at her, confesses to Ian that she is still on the run and she and Ben were planning to con him as Gavin has kidnapped Phil, so Ian throws her out, thinking <b>she</b> <b>cares</b> more about Phil than him. Jane is horrified that he told Kathy about Bobby, but Ian is confident she will not say anything to the police. Kathy then goes to the police station to report the kidnapping, while Ben tells Ian what Gavin has done. Ian contacts Gavin, telling him he knows what he has been doing. It is subsequently revealed that he has been keeping Phil locked in his closet, but by the time Kathy and the police come to his house looking for him, he is not there although a fresh blood stain is found in the kitchen. Kathy later tells the Beales what she has done, and Sharon is incensed when she finds out the truth, insisting none of it would have happened if Kathy had not returned.

500|$|A mutant, {{who has an}} {{immunity}} to toxins. About her character, Khodchenkova said [...] "Viper doesn't really have many people that <b>she</b> <b>cares</b> about, most of them she just uses for her own purpose." [...] Mangold said, [...] "as her name would imply, she's kind of snakelike," [...] and that Viper views Logan [...] "like a great hunter might view hunting a lion in his quarry." [...] The film does not reference Viper's comic book history {{as an agent of}} Hydra, due to rights issues with Marvel Studios.|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} {{is rich in}} both actual and implied iconography. Van der Weyden presents Mary as the Maria Lactans virgin type, a symbol of [...] "Mother Church" [...] especially popular at times of plague or famine, the implication being that <b>she</b> <b>cares</b> for all {{and no one will}} go hungry. This notion ties in with Luke's dual roles of physician (and thus healer) and artist. Van der Weyden had earlier portrayed Mary breast-feeding in his Virgin and Child Enthroned, which depicts equally detailed carvings carrying significance, but is reduced in size and in its cast of characters, and omits the act of beholding.|$|E

He really doesn't care what people think of him that much and he helps Akeelah out with that little matter because <b>she</b> <b>cares</b> very much of what people think about her." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} The Buzz on Maggie {{was created by}} Dave Polsky, a former writer on Scary Movie 2 and South Park. In an early {{interview}} for Animation World Network, he explained that the series utilizes a playful aspect at adolescence, naming it [...] "individuality vs. conformity". He said, [...] "Maggie must learn how to pursue her agenda without alienating those <b>she</b> <b>cares</b> about. More often than not, Maggie learns {{that it is difficult}} to negotiate life on her terms without burning bridges." [...] Dave Wasson, the creator of the animated series Time Squad, served as the director, and executively produced the series with Polsky, while Laura Perkins Brittain was the co-executive producer.|$|E
500|$|Amra Ademovic is a Bosnian nurse {{working in}} a {{hospital}} in Afghanistan {{after the fall of}} the Taliban. <b>She</b> <b>cares</b> for and later adopts Roshi, a critically wounded Afghan orphan.

While visiting the country in 2003, he had encountered a number of people who had left comfortable lifestyles to help provide relief aid, and he had wanted to pay tribute to them through the portrayal of Amra. Hosseini described the character as one of his favorites and said, [...] "She has seen humanity at its worst, having worked in war zones most of her career, and yet she has retained great capacity for compassion and mercy. She is also very street smart, fiercely intelligent, and brutally honest." ...|$|E
