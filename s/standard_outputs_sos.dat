SGM is calculated as difference between the standard values of total production and direct costs.

40|$|AbstractThe {{economic}} size {{of agricultural}} farms {{is defined by}} means of the <b>standard</b> <b>output</b> (<b>SO).</b> However, economic effects of these farms depend on the way of husbandry. The analysed family farms of the area ranging from 8. 58 ha UAA to 150 ha UAA had economic sizes ranging from € 9, 737 to € 24, 9379. Such a range made it possible to create 4 groups of farms according to classes of the economic size ES 6. Calculated developmental possibilities were from - 1167 PLN·ha- 1 UAA to 3880 PLN·ha- 1 UAA. It was stated that with an economic increase of the economic size developmental possibilities increase which is indicated by positive average correlation between these variables. In the best situation, regarding developmental possibilities are large farms having 12 times more possibilities than small farms. Significant differences in developmental possibilities between analysed groups of farms were stated. Significant differences were not stated in the amount of direct subsidies. Significant differences were stated in received direct surplus between small and large farms...|$|R
50|$|Standard {{error is}} another output stream {{typically}} used by programs to output error messages or diagnostics. It is a stream independent of <b>standard</b> <b>output</b> {{and can be}} redirected separately. This solves the semipredicate problem, allowing output and errors to be distinguished, and is analogous to a function returning a pair of values - see Semipredicate problem: Multivalued return. The usual destination is the text terminal which started the program {{to provide the best}} chance of being seen even if <b>standard</b> <b>output</b> is redirected (<b>so</b> not readily observed). For example, output of a program in a pipeline is redirected to input of the next program, but errors from each program still go directly to the text terminal.|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Farm Business Survey (FBS) is conducted annually to collect business information from c. 2, 400 farms in England and Wales. The FBS provides information on the financial position and physical and economic performance of farm businesses, to inform policy decisions on matters affecting farm businesses and to enable analysis of impacts of policy options. It is intended to {{serve the needs of}} farmers, farming and land management interest groups, government (both national and European), government partners, and researchers. The primary objective of survey results is to contrast the performance or other business characteristics of different groupings of farm, such as between regions or other geographical or environmental designations, farm types, farm size, age or education of farmer etc. Up to and including the 2001 / 02 survey, FBS estimates were based on matching of the sample between two adjacent years. Farm weights were still calculated to present a matched sample however. From the 2002 / 03 survey onwards, matching between adjacent years was dropped altogether, and weights are now calculated for the full sample. The typology used to determine the FBS farm type classification was revised for 2009 onwards. The FBS typology is now based on <b>standard</b> <b>outputs</b> expressed in euros, with a minimum threshold of 25, 000 euro (irrespective of the SLR) for FBS eligibility. Between 2009 and 2011, FBS farm type classification has been based on 2007 <b>standard</b> <b>output</b> (<b>SO)</b> coefficients. From 2012, FBS farm type classification is based on 2010 SO coefficients. The change in typology has had an effect on the distribution of farms by farm type and income averages. Further information regarding the change in typology is available from the 'FBS Documents' section on the gov. uk Farm Business Survey – technical notes and guidance webpage. The Farm Business Survey is available under Special Licence access conditions. For further details on how to apply for access to the data, see the Access section below. August 2008 : the UKDA are currently awaiting deposit of section M data for survey years 2004 / 05 to 2006 / 07. Although a peripheral analysis of 'Section O' has been published on the Defra statistics website, Defra are not yet in a position to fully release these data. Sections P and R remain unpublished and are still not available for release. Main Topics : Variables cover general and physical farm characteristics, labour, crops (previous and current harvest year, set-aside, byproducts, forage and cultivations); miscellaneous receipts, livestock (dairy and beef cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry, miscellaneous livestock), variable and fixed costs, assets, investment, liabilities, income from diversified activities (integrated and semi-integrated into the farm business), farmer and spouse off-farm hours and incomes, and subsidies...|$|R
50|$|All digital-to-analog {{converter}} boxes have both an antenna input (which accepts the coaxial cable that formerly {{went directly to}} the TV) and an RF output (which now goes directly to the TV). They may also have additional outputs. Any converter box converts the digital signal for the current digital sub-channel to an analog signal (at the reduced screen resolution of the analog <b>standard),</b> <b>outputs</b> that signal onto analog channel 3 or 4 (set by the user to avoid any conflict with local over-the-air channels) and sends that signal to the analog tuner in the TV. With a box that lacks analog passthrough, no other signals are sent to the <b>output,</b> <b>so</b> all analog stations are lost.|$|R
