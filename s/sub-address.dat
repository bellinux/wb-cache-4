50|$|This {{means that}} during a transfer, all {{communication}} is {{started by the}} Bus Controller, and a terminal device cannot start a data transfer on its own. In {{the case of an}} RT to RT transfer the sequence is as follows: An application or function in the subsystem behind the RT interface (e.g. RT1) writes the data that is to be transmitted into a specific (transmit) <b>sub-address</b> (data buffer). The time at which this data is written to the <b>sub-address</b> is not necessarily linked to the time of the transaction, though the interfaces ensure that partially updated data is not transmitted. The Bus controller commands the RT that is the destination of the data (e.g. RT2) to receive the data at a specified (receive) data <b>sub-address</b> and then commands RT1 to transmit from the transmit <b>sub-address</b> specified in the command. RT1 transmits a Status word, indicating its current status, and the data. The Bus Controller receives RT1's status word, and sees that the transmit command has been received and actioned without a problem. RT2 receives the data on the shared data bus and writes it into the designated receive <b>sub-address</b> and transmits its Status word. An application or function on the subsystem behind the receiving RT interface may then access the data. Again the timing of this read is not necessarily linked to that of the transfer. The Bus Controller receives RT2's status word and sees that the receive command and data have been received and actioned without a problem.|$|E

50|$|Such {{disposable}} addresses {{are generally}} {{provided by a}} service company (paid or free) that forwards mail from the DEA to the actual address, but email <b>sub-addressing</b> techniques {{can also be used}} to provide a subset of similar advantages.|$|R
50|$|Some mail {{services}} support a tag appended to the local-part, {{such that the}} modified address is an alias to the unmodified one. For example, the address joeuser+tag@example.com denotes the same delivery address as joeuser@example.com. RFC 5233, refers to this convention as <b>sub-addressing,</b> {{but it is also}} known as plus addressing or tagged addressing.|$|R
5000|$|Mode Command Without Data Word (Broadcast). The Bus Controller sends one command {{word with}} a Terminal address of 31 {{signifying}} a broadcast type command and a <b>sub-address</b> of 0 or 31 signifying a Mode Code type command. No Remote Terminals will respond.|$|E

50|$|The {{local part}} of an email address has no {{significance}} for intermediate mail relay systems other than the final mailbox host. Email senders and intermediate relay systems must not assume it to be case-insensitive, since the final mailbox host {{may or may not}} treat it as such. A single mailbox may receive mail for multiple email addresses, if configured by the administrator. Conversely, a single email address may be the alias to a distribution list to many mailboxes. Email aliases, electronic mailing lists, <b>sub-addressing,</b> and catch-all addresses, the latter being mailboxes that receive messages regardless of the local part, are common patterns for achieving a variety of delivery goals.|$|R
50|$|The {{addresses}} were of just 14 bits {{length to}} address both, the routers (called nodes by then) and the devices connected to them. They were formed by two fields, an 8-bit field {{to address the}} router and a <b>sub-address</b> of 6 bit to address the terminals connected to it. The node address was assigned to nodes {{and not to the}} ends of the links as in Internet.|$|E
5000|$|An L4 segment, is {{essentially}} the payload of an L3 packet. The L4 header, in its short form, consists of just a single byte.The main field in the short L4 header is a 5-bit [...] "CPort" [...] identifier which {{can be seen as}} a <b>sub-address</b> within a UniPro device and is somewhat analogous to the port numbers used in TCP or UDP. Thus every segment (with a short header) is addressed to a specific CPort of specific UniPro device.|$|E
50|$|The image below exemplifies {{many of the}} {{protocol}} and physical layer concepts explained above. For example, the RT address contained in the Command Word has a value of 0x3 (in range of 0 to 31). The sixth bit is 1, indicating a Transmit from the RT. The <b>sub-address</b> is 0x01. The last 5 bits indicate {{the number of words}} to expect take a value of 1, which is matched by the single Data Word (value 0x2) after the Status Word.|$|E
5000|$|The Command Word {{is built}} as follows. The first 5 bits are the Remote Terminal address (0-31). The sixth bit is 0 for Receive or 1 for Transmit. The next 5 bits {{indicate}} the location (<b>sub-address)</b> to hold or get {{data on the}} Terminal (1-30). Note that sub-addresses 0 and 31 are reserved for Mode Codes. The last 5 bits indicate {{the number of words}} to expect (1-32). All zero bits indicate 32 words. In the case of a Mode Code, these bits indicate the Mode Code number (e.g., Initiate Self Test and Transmit BIT Word).|$|E
50|$|VC may be {{established}} using X.121 addresses. The X.121 address {{consists of a}} three-digit data country code (DCC) plus a network digit, together forming the four-digit data network identification code (DNIC), followed by the national terminal number (NTN) of at most ten digits. Note {{the use of a}} single network digit, seemingly allowing for only 10 network carriers per country, but some countries are assigned more than one DCC to avoid this limitation. Networks often used fewer than the full NTN digits for routing, and made the spare digits available to the subscriber (sometimes called the <b>sub-address)</b> where they could be used to identify applications or for further routing on the subscribers networks.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} first discusses end-to-end interworking {{in so-called}} ATM internets {{consisting of a}} concatenation {{of public and private}} ATM networks. It shows that in an ATM internet connection oriented interworking is likely to be achieved using normal ISDN signaling procedures, whereas connectionless interworking, if based on the I. cls draft [1], lacks a means to identify stations in the private components of ATM internets. In order to remedy the connectionless situation, a proposal is made to extend the current I. cls address format with an optional <b>sub-address</b> field. 1. Introduction This contribution first introduces the concept of ATM internets and discusses in a tutorial style (for a benefit to the author itself) how end-to-end interworking can be achieved in such networks both in case of connection oriented and connectionless mode of communication. Then, based on this discussion, the current draft on Connectionless Broadband Data Service (CBDS) on B-ISDN (I. cls) [1] is criti [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{complete}} USB interface package {{has been developed}} together at the hardware, firmware and software levels. It targets the development of boards and test benches, permitting an easy access from a computer through a simple USB cable. The hardware {{is based upon the}} FT 245 B circuit from the FTDI Company. The latter being indeed only a « byte pipe », a simple and effective encapsulation frame protocol has been developed in order to distinguish between the different bytes. The goal is to propose a « plug and play » system comprising the hardware interface on the board, the decoding block to be integrated within a FPGA on the user side and the graphical software interface on the computer. Libraries for LabView and C code are thus available. The FPGA internal interface on the user side is simplified, proposing an 8 -bit parallel bus with a 7 -bit <b>sub-address</b> and the few necessary control lines. Interruptions are also managed. This project offers all the different types of functioning of usual data acquisition systems, which may be triggered either from the computer or from the peripheral side. Because of its simplicity and transparency for the user, it is already used on a lot of different acquisition boards and test benches in the nuclear and high energy physics domain. It is available on the LAL web site...|$|E
40|$|BROWN SUMMARY The slit-lamp {{examination}} of the child's lens with cataract can yield useful prognostic signs, especially when this is supplemented by slit-image photography and measurement. A normal lens size for the subject's age is a good prognostic sign and is usually associated with a static cataract or with very slow deterioration in a developmental cataract. A small lens and absence of the anterior subcapsular clear zone are each associated with progressive cataract. Nuclear lamellar cataracts are shown to become smaller in diameter with time, which favours medical treatment with mydriasis. The technique of quantitative slit-image photo-graphy of the lens (Fig. 1) (Brown, 1972 a, b) pro-vides information on {{the dimensions of the}} lens, in-cluding sagittal width and radius of curvature of the surfaces and of dimensions and situation of the cataract. This information is not easily obtained by any other technique, and the photographs have also the advantage of providing a permanent record with which to compare future examinations. A number of features in the photographs have prognostic value, in particular the observation of the anterior <b>sub-Address</b> for reprints: N. P.

Lens growth The lens grows at a steady rate throughout life, at least between the ages of 10 and 80 (Fig. 2) (Francois, 1959; Brown and Tripathi, 1974), but there are in-sufficient data below the age of 10 to say whether the growth rate is any different then. The growth is mainly cortical, and there is very little change in the width of the nucleus with age (Fig. 2), when the limit Fig. 1 Slit-image photograph of the lens ofa year-old girl showing developmental catarac...|$|E
