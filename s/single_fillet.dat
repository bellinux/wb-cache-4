This binding {{of the hair}} by the <b>single</b> <b>fillet</b> marks the straight course of one great system of art method, from that Greek head which I showed you on the archaic coin of the seventh century before Christ, to this of the fifteenth of our own era;--nay, when you look close, {{you will see the}} entire action of the head depends on one lock of hair falling back from the ear, which it does in compliance with the old Greek observance of its being bent there by the pressure of the helmet. That rippling of it down her shoulders comes from the Athena of Corinth; the raising of it on her forehead, from the knot of the hair of Diana, changed into the vestal fire of the angels. But chiefly, the calmness of the features in the one face, and their anxiety in the other, indicate first, indeed, the characteristic difference in every conception of the schools, the Greek never representing expression, the Italian primarily seeking it; but far more, mark for us here the utter change in the conception of love; from the tranquil guide and queen of a happy terrestrial domestic life, accepting its immediate pleasures and natural duties, to the agonizing hope of an infinite good, and the ever mingled joy and terror of a love divine in jealousy, crying, [...] "Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm; for love is strong as death, jealousy is cruel as the grave." ...|$|E

40|$|Finite Element Analysis (FEA) {{has become}} a {{practical}} method of predicting stresses and deflection for loaded structures. FEA identifies the load path, which can be difficult using classical analysis with complex structures. Welding enables direct transfer of stress between members, eliminating gusset and splice plates necessary for bolted structures. In this paper <b>single</b> transverse <b>fillet</b> weld and double transverse fillet weld are used for analysis. Weld joints form {{an important part of}} pressure vessels, they are highly essential for structural integrity of the system. Typical welds are done on flat surfaces and their strengths are well catalogued for reference. The objective of this research project is to analyze welds on curved plated and determine their strength, and create a similar catalogue for curved surfaces of certain cases...|$|R

Statistical quality control chart for fraction defectives is explained by noting defective fish sausages per shift from a sausage industry while control chart for number of defectives is illustrated for number of defective fish cans in each hour of its production of a canning industry. C-chart is another type of control chart which is explained here for number of defects per <b>single</b> fish <b>fillet</b> sampled a 1 l random for every five minutes in a processing industry. These statistical quality control charts help in the more economic use of resource, time and labour than control charts for variables of products. Also control charts for attributes exhibit the quality history of finished products at different times of production thereby minimizing the risk of consumer rejection...|$|R

40|$|In all fusion welded joints, residual, transverse, lateral, angular and bowing {{deformations}} are observed. In fillet joints {{the angular}} distortion is the predominant deformation. The distortions and thermal {{history of a}} fillet joint can be measured experimentally which is not economically viable all times. It is time consuming and the deformation can be measured only {{after the completion of}} the joining process. So prevention is not possible. In the present work a numerical elasto-plastic thermo mechanical model has been developed for predicting the thermal history and resulting angular distortions of manual metal arc welding in one sided fillet joints. To create a realistic simulation of the <b>single</b> sided <b>fillet</b> welding, a moving distributed heat source is used in finite element model. The effect of filler metal deposition is simulated by implementing a birth and death process for the elements. The temperature dependent material properties are used for predicting the transient temperature distribution in the material which in turn helps to predict the angular distortion profiles of the fillet joint. The simulated modeling results obtained are found to be in complete agreement with the experimental values...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Control of seismic, {{medical and}} {{automobile}} vibrations represents a vast {{area of research}} that is growing rapidly. Magneto rheological (MR) dampers are {{a new class of}} devices that match well with the requirements and constraints of applications, including the necessity of having very low power requirements. The performance of MR damper depends on its magnetic and hydraulic circuit design. In this paper a finite element model is used to examine and investigate the 2 - D axi-symmetric MR damper. Nine different configurations of piston for MR damper are simulated in order to investigate how the profile of the piston affected the maximum pressure drop that the damper could provide. The piston velocity and the input current to the coil are varied to evaluate the resulting change in magnetic flux density (B) and pressure drop (ΔP). The simulation results of the different configuration of piston show that the performance of <b>single</b> coil with <b>filleted</b> piston ends was better than that of other configurations for the same magnitude of input current and piston velocity.

These devices have found varied applications like control of vibrations in seat suspension systems, rotary braking systems, prosthetics, seismic systems etc. The performance of MR damper depends on its magnetic and hydraulic circuit design.

40|$|Gilt edges. Full brown morocco grain. Marbled {{endpapers}} and pastedowns. Front cover blocked {{in black}} and back cover blocked identically in reverse. A thin double fillet is blocked on the border. Within the rectangle it forms is a smaller double fillet forming an inner border. The horizontal and vertical sides of the inner border run on into the outer border to form a central rectangle with two narrower oblong vertical panels at either side and oblong panels at the head and foot which intersect at the corners to form small squares. The central panel is blank except for a fillet which continuously follows {{the inside of the}} panel border in a pattern alternately urdy and nebuly. Within the nebulas is a repeated pattern of a blocked oval and within the 'pointed battlements' is a repeated pattern of three blocked dots. The border fillet of the central panel extends in all four directions into each of the adjoining side, upper and lower panels to create a narrower panel, each of which is decorated by a repeating pattern of blocked circles. From the upper and lower narrower panel, one at each end, two more double vertical fillets extend to the cover edge. The right hand narrower panel also has two double fillets extending to the cover edge. The left-hand narrower panel has four equidistant imitation spine-cover clasps which extend to the spine. In each of the four corner squares is a floral arabesque blocked in black. The spine is blocked {{in black and}} gold. At the head and tail thin double horizontal fillets are blocked in black. Above the tail fillets a second double fillet creates a panel in which the word '| ILLUSTRATED |' is blocked in gold. The spine is otherwise divided into five panels each enclosed at the top and bottom by thin double and triple fillets between which is blocked in black a pattern of alternating trefoils and flower crowns. The panels are further separated from each other by a <b>single</b> thin <b>fillet</b> blocked in black.
