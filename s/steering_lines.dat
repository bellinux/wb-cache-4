50|$|Common {{types of}} leaks {{for many people}} include leaks in vehicle tires, causing air to leak out {{resulting}} in flat tires, and leaks in containers, spilling the contents. Leaks can occur or develop in {{many different kinds of}} household, building, vehicle, marine, aircraft, or industrial fluid systems, whether the fluid is a gas or liquid. Leaks in vehicle hydraulic systems such as brake or power <b>steering</b> <b>lines</b> could cause outleakage of brake or power steering fluid resulting in failure of the brakes, power steering, or other hydraulic system. Also possible are leaks of engine coolant - particularly in the radiator and at the water pump seal, transmission fluid, motor oil, and refrigerant in the air conditioning system. Some of these vehicle fluids have different colors to help identify the type of leaking fluid. A zinc-carbon battery is an example of an easy-leaking system; the electrolytes inside the cell sometimes leak out of the cell casing and cause damage to an electronic appliance.|$|E
50|$|Until Andrée's last {{camp was}} found in 1930, what could have {{happened}} to the expedition was the subject of myth and rumours. In 1898, eleven months after Andrée's first sighting of White Island (which he called New Iceland) a Swedish polar expedition led by A. G. Nathorst was passing by just 1 km offshore from the camp, but the weather stopped them from getting ashore. Already around this time, it was noticed that a heavy storm had been raging and that the expedition had lost the <b>steering</b> <b>lines</b> at departure, and experienced polar explorers surmised already before 1930 that the expedition couldn't have got very far and had likely been forced down on the ice. Finally the remains of the three men were found in 1930 by the Norwegian Bratvaag Expedition which picked up remains including two bodies. A month later the ship M/K Isbjørn, hired by a newspaper, made additional finds, among them the third body. Notebooks, diaries, photographic negatives, the boat and many utensils and other objects were recovered. The homecoming of the bodies of Andrée and his colleagues Strindberg and Frænkel was a grand event. King Gustaf V delivered an oration, and the explorers received a funeral with great honors. The three explorers were cremated and their ashes interred together at the cemetery Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.|$|E

40|$|The {{traction}} power of kites {{can be used}} for wind energy conversion at a potentially low cost. Crucially important is a reliable control of flight path and tether reeling. The present study proposes a modelling framework describing the dynamic behaviour of the inter-connected system components, suitable for design and optimization of the control systems. The wing, bridle line system, airborne control unit and tether are represented as a particle system using spring-damper elements to describe the mechanical properties of the tensile structure. Two alternative kite models are proposed. The point mass model accounts only for the translational inertia of the wing, assuming an instantaneous alignment with the local relative flow. The aerodynamic side force is assumed to be a linear function of the <b>steering</b> <b>line</b> actuation. The four point model accounts also for the rotational inertia of the wing and discretises the aerodynamics by a centre section and two tip sections. The local angle of attack at the tip sections are assumed to be functions of the corresponding <b>steering</b> <b>line</b> actuations. To simulate reel-out and reel-in of the tether, the lengths of the individual tether elements are varied and the dynamic behaviour of the ground station is included. To validate the modelling framework, it is combined with the automatic control system used for the operation of a kite power system demonstrator. The simulation results show that the point mass model can be adjusted to match the measured behaviour during a pumping cycle. The four point model is more accurate, with an efficiency error of less than 2 %, and remains stable also at low tether forces. Compared to previous approaches, the proposed modelling framework is more accurate and robust while allowing dynamic simulations of the complete system at real-time speed...|$|R

40|$|Powered parachutes (PPC) {{represent}} {{a very unique}} class of aircraft which have thus far seen limited use beyond recreational flight. Their slow flight and large payload characteristics make them a practical platform for applications such as aerial spraying and surveillance. The portability of the units when not airborne, fast transition to flight readiness, inherent stability, and simplicity of control enhance their appeal for use as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). The aircraft fly using only three control inputs consisting of two <b>steering</b> <b>lines</b> and a throttle for control of climb and descent. One {{of the more interesting}} characteristics that distinguish PPC from conventional aircraft is the pendulum stability which is a consequence of suspending the majority of the aircraft weight so far from the wing surface and which introduces an appreciable amount of lag into the system. Another interesting phenomenon is their speed stability which causes the aircraft to fly at a relatively constant speed whether it is climbing, descending, or flying straight-and-level. The current study seeks {{to examine the effects of}} throttle on the longitudinal dynamics of PPC, using a small-scale aircraft. A dynamic model has been derived using analytical methods and computer-simulated in MATLAB and Simulink, developed by The Mathworks. The validity of the model was then verified using data recorded from the small-scale PPC. Effects of parameters such as aircraft weight and thrust were examined and related to flight characteristics such as airspeed and climb rate. Finally, a control system was developed to deal with the aforementioned lag and demonstrate accurate altitude-hold capability for a powered parachute...|$|E

40|$|With growing energy {{demands and}} a need {{to switch to a}} {{sustainable}} source of energy key stakeholders are considering the use of high altitude wind energy systems. TU Delft and its start up company kitepower are key stakeholders investigating the commercial viability of this technology. With this goal the research group has developed several kite systems capable of accessing high altitude winds. It is believed that the low investment cost and high performance of kites could lead to a lower cost of energy. Concepts currently being considered involve a leading edge inflatable (LEI) kite that is controlled by an on-board control unit and is connected to a ground-based generator. Once the kite is deployed to the required altitude it enters a power generation stage where it is flown in a figure eight routine. This routine is controlled by the on-board control unit that pulls on tethers that are connected to the tip of the kite. This process is followed by a retraction phase where the kite is pulled back in. The goal of the system is to maximize energy production in the generation phase while limiting the energy consumed in the retraction phase. It is critical to assess and improve the kite design and its performance at all stages of operation such that the net power production can be maximized. While significant advancements have been made into the performance for normal flight {{there is a lack of}} research on the aerodynamic performance when there is control input to initiate a turn. The shape of the kite and the high angle of attack at which the kite is flown results in complex flow behavior involving separation, flow vortices, flow reattachment etc. This poses several challenges to maintain accuracy. A computational approach involving a steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier Stoke (RANS) simulation is believed to be a computationally viable mode of analysis to capture the flow behavior. This thesis details the approach used to improve results attained using this method and understand the influence of deformations associated with control inputs on the aerodynamic performance of the kite. A control input is simulated using a finite element model (FEM) with the Abaqus software by reducing the length of the right steering and increasing the length of the left <b>steering</b> <b>line</b> by 0. 5 m. This results in the right side reducing its curvature and being pulled towards the kite control unit (KCU). Whilst on the left side the bridle lines are less tensed, leading to an increase in curvature. The turning performance is governed by the offset and variations in magnitudes of forces. Meshes are generated that attempts to minimize geometry alterations whilst still maintaining high quality. The influence of boundary layer parameters are investigated. A trade-off is made where the influence of key parameters on accuracy and computational time is evaluated; where applicable improvements are made. Both the global as well as the local parameters of the kite in normal as well as turning orientation are analyzed. The results show that control induced deformations lead to a percentage reduction in the lift, whilst the effect on the drag is minimal. It is further seen that the kite initiates stall at an angle of approximately 40 degrees. The stall behavior is initiated at the mid-span of the kite and gradually moves to the tip. The turning performance is measured by looking at the yaw moment. The magnitude of this parameter is linked to the offset and magnitude in force vectors at the tip. Due to the delayed stall at the tips, it is observed that the yaw moment increases beyond 40 degrees. Accuracy issues using this method were seen when performing a validation study on a profile similar to that of the kite. These issues could be due to limitations of the method or potential errors in the reference study. It is recommended to reevaluate the validation study before using this method for detailed flow analysis. It is concluded, that in order to fully trust the relevance of the results, one would have to have to conduct a validation study. However the method’s ability to address non-linear flow effects within a limited time frame makes it a viable option for design optimization/system modelling...|$|R

Materials and Methods The needle is composed of a 1. 32 -mm outer-diameter cannula, with a flexure joint near the tip, and a retractable stylet. The bending stiffness of the needle resembles that of a 20 -gauge hypodermic needle. The needle functionality was evaluated in manual insertions by steering to predefined targets and a lateral displacement of 20 mm from the straight insertion <b>line.</b> <b>Steering</b> tasks were conducted in 5 directions and 2 tissue simulants under image guidance from a camera. The repeatability in instrument actuations was assessed during 100 mm deep automated insertions with a linear motor. In addition to tip position, tip angles were tracked during the insertions. Results The targeting error (mean absolute error ± standard deviation) during manual steering to 5 different targets in stiff tissue was 0. 5 mm ± 1. 1. This variability in manual tip placement (1. 1 mm) was less than the variability among automated insertions (1. 4 mm) in the same tissue type. An increased tissue stiffness resulted in an increased lateral tip displacement. The tip angle was directly controlled by the user interface, and remained unaffected by the tissue stiffness.

The quarter-scale, high-fidelity model includes part of the lower fuselage and the gear cavity. The full model configuration allowed for removal of various gear components (e. g. light cluster, <b>steering</b> mechanism, hydraulic <b>lines,</b> etc.) in order to document their effects on the local flow field. The measurements were conducted at a Reynolds number of 7. 3 ! 104 based on the shock strut (piston) diameter and a freestream Mach number of 0. 166. Additional data were also collected at lower Mach numbers of 0. 12 and 0. 145 and correspondingly lower Reynolds numbers. The boundary layer on the piston was tripped to enable turbulent flow separation, so as to better mimic the conditions encountered during flight. Steady surface pressures were gathered from an extensive number of static ports on the wheels, door, fuselage, and within the gear cavity. To better understand the resultant flow interactions between gear components, surface pressure fluctuations were collected via sixteen dynamic pressure sensors strategically placed on various sub-components of the gear. Fifteen of the transducers were flush mounted on the gear surface at fixed locations, while the remaining one was a mobile transducer that could be placed at numerous varying locations. The measured surface pressure spectra are mainly broadband in nature, lacking any local peaks associated with coherent vortex shedding. This finding is in agreement with off-surface flow measurements using PIV that revealed the flow field to be a collection of separated shear layers without any dominant vortex shedding processes...|$|R
