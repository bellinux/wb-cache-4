5|$|Enforcers {{sometimes}} start {{fights to}} build game momentum {{and provide a}} psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition. This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that reason, {{it can also be}} a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> wrong way.|$|E
5|$|Epaminondas {{was given}} {{charge of the}} Boeotian army, with the other six Boeotarchs in an {{advisory}} capacity. Pelopidas, meanwhile, was captain of the Sacred Band, the elite Theban troops. Before the battle, there was evidently much debate amongst the Boeotarchs about whether to fight or not. As a consistent advocate of an aggressive policy, Epaminondas wished to fight, and supported by Pelopidas, he managed to <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> vote in favour of battle.* Sage, Warfare in Ancient Greece, 138; Seager, The King's Peace, 183 During {{the course of the}} battle, Epaminondas was to display a grasp of tactics hitherto unseen in Greek warfare.|$|E

He also scored 36 runs at 36.00 in the ODIs. His ability to <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> ball both ways and his innings in Lahore led to speculation {{that he could}} become an all rounder. In recognition of his performances {{at the start of}} his international career, Pathan was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year in 2004.|$|E

50|$|As {{observed}} from an end-view of <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> bob, <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> of <b>the</b> bob {{will always}} line up or swing towards one star (just like {{the axis of}} the Earth points at one star for the time periods considered) as <b>the</b> bob <b>swings</b> through <b>the</b> central axis of the pendulum. There can be a slight ellipsoid <b>swing</b> if <b>the</b> initial conditions of angular motion are not cancelled {{but there is no}} longer a force acting on the bob causing it to have an angular velocity after the bob is released. The plane of <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> of <b>the</b> pendulum bob is now independent of the surface of the earth which was imparting a force to the bob before it was released (through the holding point). As noted previously, the bob is still spinning with the Earth (a spot of the bob will spin with the Earth), even though the bob is no longer turning with the Earth. Thus the Earth continues to turn underneath <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> of <b>the</b> pendulum while <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> of <b>the</b> pendulum remains in a fixed plane that doesn't rotate (turn).|$|R

5|$|Shein began {{surrender}} {{negotiations in}} January 1634, and by February {{they were in}} full <b>swing.</b> <b>The</b> Russians finally signed a surrender treaty on 25 February 1634, and on 1 March they vacated their camp. (Some scholars, such as Rickard and Black, give the date of 1 March for Shein's capitulation.) Under the surrender terms, the Russians had to leave behind most of their artillery but were allowed to retain their banners after a ceremony {{in which they were}} laid before King Władysław. They also had to promise not to engage Commonwealth forces for the next three months. Shein's forces numbered around 12,000 {{at the time of their}} capitulation, but over 4,000, including most of the foreign contingent, immediately decided to defect to the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|This {{experimental}} {{freedom was}} fully exercised on the Daddies' second album, Rapid City Muscle Car. Self-produced and self-recorded, Rapid City Muscle Car was the band's attempt at creating an eclectic concept album wherein each track was composed {{in a different}} musical style, yet were all thematically united through interconnected lyricism. Anchored in funk and <b>swing,</b> <b>the</b> album featured genre experiments in ska punk, psychedelic rock, country, rockabilly, big band, hard rock and lounge. Released on the band's self-operated label Space Age Bachelor Pad Records in December 1994, the album sold decently, though failed to match the success of Ferociously Stoned.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} tee-batting skills in relation to ground reaction forces. Eithteen batters tried seven <b>swings</b> on <b>the</b> force platform recording three-dimensional kinetic data. A video camera (60 fps) was used to measure ball velocity and <b>swing</b> velocity. <b>The</b> following results were obtained. 1) A statistically significant correlation was observed between <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> velocity and <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> time. 2 Statistically significant correlations were observed between <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> velocity and <b>the</b> anteroposterior forces during backward <b>swing</b> phase, <b>the</b> mean power calculated from the anteroposterior force during forward swing phase. 3) Statistically significant correlations were obtained between <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> velocity, <b>the</b> ball velocity and the mediolateral distance of the CG of the body from the starting position during backward <b>swing</b> phase. 4) <b>The</b> <b>swing</b> velocity and <b>the</b> ball velocity significantly correlated with the mediolateral distance of the CG of the body between the starting phase and the impact phase. 5) Coefficient of variations (cv) of the vertical forces during backward <b>swing</b> phase and <b>the</b> mean power calculated from the vertical force significantly correlated with cv of <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> velocity. CV of the vertical power of the CG of the body significantly correlated with cv of the ball velocity. These findings suggest that the batter should move the body toward the opposite side of the ball and the anterior direction just before the starting phase of <b>the</b> forward <b>swing</b> to obtain <b>the</b> high <b>swing</b> velocity. <b>The</b> result also suggests that the batter should control the vertical movement during backward and forward <b>swing</b> to obtain <b>the</b> high reproducibility of batting.

5|$|After {{the other}} {{candidates}} had been nominated, the first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; Sherman's 93 placed him in a distant third, and no candidate had the required majority of 379. Sherman's delegates could <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> nomination to either Grant or Blaine, {{but he refused to}} release them through twenty-eight ballots {{in the hope that the}} anti-Grant forces would desert Blaine and flock to him. By the end of the first day, it was clear that neither Grant nor Blaine could muster a majority; a compromise candidate would be necessary. Sherman held out hope that he would be that compromise candidate, but while his vote tally reached as high as 120, he never commanded even all of Ohio's delegates. His divided home-state support was likely fatal to his cause, as Blaine delegates, searching for a new champion, did not think Sherman would make a popular candidate. After several days of balloting, Blaine's men found their compromise candidate, but instead of Sherman they shifted their votes to his fellow Ohioan, Garfield. By the thirty-sixth ballot, Garfield had 399 votes, enough for victory.|$|E

5|$|In 1821, {{the year}} that the War of Independence broke out, nine issues {{appeared}} between January and May.

In the issue of May 1, while Ypsilantis’ campaign was in full <b>swing,</b> <b>the</b> Austrian authorities required the editors to publish the excommunication issued by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Gregory V, against the architects of this uprising. This was the last issue of Hermes o Logios which then was closed down by the local authorities and Kokkinakis was arrested as a member of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia.|$|E

5|$|Pathan gained {{selection}} for the 2007–08 tour of Australia, {{but did not}} play {{in the first two}} Tests with only two pacemen chosen. Zaheer and Singh were the first-choice pace duo before the former was injured and replaced by Ishant, who had taken five wickets in the first innings of the Bangalore Test. With the Third Test held on the bouncy WACA Ground in Perth, Pathan replaced second spinner Harbhajan Singh. He batted well with scores of 28 and 46 respectively. His second innings performance came as a nightwatchman in order to shield other batsmen from the new ball late in the second day. After entering at the fall of the first wicket, he batted {{for more than two hours}} and was the sixth man to fall. Pathan rediscovered his ability to <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> ball, taking 2/63 and 3/54, including both Australian openers in each innings, having the hosts two wickets down in both innings before 50 runs had been scored. He had four of his victims caught behind the wicket off an edge and trapped Chris Rogers lbw. India won by 72 runs and Pathan was recognised with the man of the match award.|$|E
5|$|Taylor v. Beckham, , {{was a case}} {{heard before}} the Supreme Court of the United States on April 30 and May 1, 1900, to decide {{the outcome of the}} disputed Kentucky gubernatorial {{election}} of 1899. The litigants were Republican gubernatorial candidate William S. Taylor and Democratic lieutenant gubernatorial candidate J. C. W. Beckham. In the November 7, 1899, election, Taylor received 193,714 votes to Democrat William Goebel's 191,331. This result was certified by a 2–1decision of the state's Board of Elections. Goebel challenged the election results on the basis of alleged voting irregularities, and the Democrat-controlled Kentucky General Assembly formed a committee to investigate Goebel's claims. Goebel was shot on January 30, 1900, one day before the General Assembly approved the committee's report declaring enough Taylor votes invalid to <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> election to Goebel. As he lay dying of his wounds, Goebel was sworn into office on January 31, 1900. He died on February 3, 1900, and Beckham ascended to the governorship.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} Soviet Union and Lithuania {{escalated}} along with Germany's successes. By mid-March 1940, the Winter War with Finland {{was over and}} the Soviets could concentrate their attention on gaining control of the Baltic states. In April, after Germany occupied Denmark, a Lithuanian envoy in Moscow reported rising hostility from Russian diplomats. During May, while the Battle of France was in full <b>swing,</b> <b>the</b> Soviets intensified their rhetoric and diplomatic pressure. On May 16, shortly after the German invasion of Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands, Soviet official newspaper Izvestia published an article warning that it was naive for a small country to attempt neutrality while giants were fighting for survival. Between May 18 and May 25, Russian soldiers moved some military equipment from Vilnius to Gaižiūnai, a location {{much closer to the}} government seat in Kaunas. The action's proximity to the then-capital carried symbolic weight.|$|E

5|$|Throughout gameplay, {{the player}} {{encounters}} various minigames, {{which range from}} simple to more complex. The first type of minigame encountered is a battle sequence that resembles a fighting game, but no interaction from the player is required to fight. These recurring battle sequences represent when {{the members of the}} Little Busters get into physical fights with either each other or with others. Each member of the fight has a set of statistics attributed to them (which includes strength, stamina, agility, reflex, concentration, judgment, and luck) along with a life bar to keep track of how many hit points a fighter has left. The maximum number of hit points is determined by the given fighter's stamina rating. Weapons may be used along with any accessories the fighter has in their possession, and these items may be exchanged with other characters. Another recurring minigame involves the player being able to play baseball batting practice with members of the Little Busters. The player, as Riki, controls his position and when to <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> bat.|$|E
5|$|With the {{breakthrough}} of third wave ska into the American mainstream by late 1996, the Daddies seemed poised for commercial success, landing {{a spot on}} a well-publicized national tour with popular ska bands Reel Big Fish and Let's Go Bowling. Although the band were mainly playing ska shows at the time, they soon began drawing a sizable following for their swing material when the coincident success of the film Swingers and its featured band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy started drawing public and media attention towards the formerly underground swing revival movement. When fans regularly began approaching the band's merchandise table asking which of their albums contained the most <b>swing,</b> <b>the</b> Daddies realized they lacked an album fully representing their swing side, prompting the band's manager to convince them to compile all of their swing songs onto one CD until {{they could afford to}} make a new album, using their available finances to record several bonus tracks for inclusion. The result, , became an unexpectedly popular item as the band went on tour, reportedly selling as many as 4,000 copies a week through their Northwest distributors.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} {{to come to}} grips with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> match back from England's firm control.|$|E

5|$|Hayes had {{announced}} {{early in his}} presidency {{that he would not}} seek another term, which meant that the contest for the Republican nomination in 1880 was open to all challengers—including Blaine. Blaine was among the early favorites for the nomination, as were former President Grant, Treasury Secretary John Sherman of Ohio, and Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont. Although Grant did not actively promote his candidacy, his entry into the race re-energized the Stalwarts and when the convention met in Chicago in June 1880, they instantly polarized the delegates into Grant and anti-Grant factions, with Blaine the most popular choice of the latter group. Blaine was nominated by James Frederick Joy of Michigan, but in contrast to Ingersoll’s exciting speech of 1876, Joy’s lengthy oration was remembered only for its maladroitness. After the other candidates were nominated, the first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; no other candidate had more than Sherman’s 93, and none had the required majority of 379. Sherman’s delegates could <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> nomination to either Grant or Blaine, but he refused to release them through twenty-eight ballots {{in the hope that the}} anti-Grant forces would desert Blaine and flock to him.
