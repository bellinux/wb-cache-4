5|$|Another {{conspiracy}} claim regards a {{patch of}} missing data in Google Sky near the constellation of Orion, which has often been cited as evidence that Nibiru has been redacted. However, the same region of sky can still be viewed by thousands of amateur astronomers. A scientist at Google said that the missing data {{is due to a}} glitch in the <b>stitching</b> software used to piece the images together.|$|E
5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within {{a few days}} of the impending birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act out of sync with normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in which case either <b>stitching</b> or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{and most}} basic <b>stitch</b> found in kanthas is the running <b>stitch.</b> The predominant {{form of this}} <b>stitch</b> is called the phor or kantha <b>stitch.</b> The other forms of <b>stitches</b> used are the Chatai or pattern darning, Kaitya or bending <b>stitch,</b> weave running <b>stitch,</b> darning <b>stitch,</b> Jessore <b>stitch</b> (a variation of darning <b>stitch),</b> threaded running <b>stitch,</b> Lik phor or anarasi or ghar hasia (Holbein) <b>stitches.</b> The <b>stitches</b> used in modern-day kantha are the Kasmiri <b>stitch</b> and the arrowhead <b>stitch.</b> <b>Stitches</b> like the herringbone <b>stitch,</b> satin <b>stitch,</b> backstitch and cross-stitch are occasionally used.|$|R
25|$|The more {{advanced}} <b>stitches</b> are often combinations of these basic <b>stitches,</b> or {{are made by}} inserting the hook into the work in unusual locations.

5|$|Many booklet stamps can be {{identified}} by one non-perforated edge, though a few are perforated on all edges. On booklets up to 1977, the printing plate construction enabled both upright and inverted watermarks in equal quantities owing to a gutter dividing rows 6 and 7 in the sheets of 12 × 10 stamps. The gutter was used for <b>stitching</b> during assembly, requiring rows 4–6 and 10–12 to be turned through 180 degrees so those panes could be stitched on {{the left of the}} booklet.|$|E
5|$|The user {{interface}} and menus {{were created by}} Joe Kowalski, who had previously worked on similar game elements for Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, and the Rock Band series. Much of the game's interface elements used a medieval woodcut art style, and were designed to contrast well against the world's graphics. The introductory menu is presented as an interactive movie created from live action clips of Jack Black manipulating a prop gatefold vinyl record album, using Adobe After Effects to provide the on-screen text, controls handling, and <b>stitching</b> of separate scenes into a seamless movie.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Ekholm was {{skeptical of the}} balloon's ability to retain hydrogen, from his own measurements. His {{buoyancy}} checks {{in the summer of}} 1896, during the process of producing the hydrogen and pumping it into the balloon, convinced him that the balloon leaked too much to ever reach the Pole, let alone go on to Russia or Canada. The worst leakage came from the approximately eight million tiny <b>stitching</b> holes along the seams, which no amount of glued-on strips of silk or applications of special secret-formula varnish seemed to seal. The balloon was losing 68kilograms (150lb) of lift force a day. Taking into account its heavy load, Ekholm estimated that it would be able to stay airborne for 17 days at most, not 30. When {{it was time to go}} home, he warned Andrée that he would not take part in the next attempt, scheduled for summer 1897, unless a stronger, better-sealed balloon was bought.|$|E

25|$|A cricket ball is not {{a perfect}} sphere. The seam of the ball is the {{circular}} <b>stitching</b> which joins {{the two halves of}} the cricket ball. Hence, the seam joining the pieces of leather is circumferential and the <b>stitching</b> is noticeably raised. If the ball is bowled {{in such a way that}} the seam hits the pitch when it bounces, this irregularity can cause the ball to deviate sideways in its path. It may move in any direction, or just go straight. The batsman has to see how the ball moves after pitching to select his shot.|$|E
25|$|Higher {{demagnification}} {{will increase}} the mask size or {{reduce the size of}} the printed field. Reduced field size would divide full-size chip patterns (normally taking up 26mm × 33mm) among two or more conventional 6-inch EUV masks. Large (approaching or exceeding 500mm2) chips, typically used for GPUs or servers, would have to be stitched together from two or more sub-patterns from different masks. Without field <b>stitching,</b> die size would be limited. With field <b>stitching,</b> features that cross field boundaries would have alignment errors, and the extra time required to change masks would reduce the throughput of the EUV system.|$|E

50|$|Additional {{variables}} {{in the types of}} overlock <b>stitches</b> are the <b>stitch</b> eccentric, and the <b>stitch</b> width. The <b>stitch</b> eccentric indicates how many <b>stitches</b> per inch there are, which is adjustable and can vary widely within one machine. Different <b>stitch</b> eccentrics create more or less dense and solid-looking edges. The <b>stitch</b> width indicates how wide the <b>stitch</b> is {{from the edge of the}} fabric. Lightweight fabrics often require a wider <b>stitch</b> to prevent pulling.|$|R

25|$|Fashions in crochet {{changed with}} the end of the Victorian era in the 1890s. Crocheted laces in the new Edwardian era, peaking between 1910 and 1920, became even more {{elaborate}} in texture and complicated <b>stitching.</b>|$|E
25|$|The huipil is a tunic-like garment made by <b>stitching</b> {{together}} {{anywhere from}} one to five pieces of cloth. The most common fiber is cotton, but there are those made from wool and silk as well. Most huipils are made from two or three pieces, which are usually the same size, with one exception being those from the highlands of Chiapas, where the center piece is wider than the side ones. The panels are not sewn together in the normal sense with seams but rather they are joined using ribbons, small strips of cloth or complicated <b>stitching</b> which has {{the edges of the}} panels touching or almost touching. This adds a layer of decoration to the garment.|$|E
25|$|The {{sewing machine}} was {{introduced}} in 1846, and provided an alternative method for the mechanization of shoemaking. By the late 1850s, the industry was beginning to shift towards the modern factory, mainly in the US and areas of England. A shoe <b>stitching</b> machine was invented by the American Lyman Blake in 1856 and perfected by 1864. Entering into partnership with McKay, his device {{became known as the}} McKay <b>stitching</b> machine and was quickly adopted by manufacturers throughout New England. As bottlenecks opened up in the production line due to these innovations, {{more and more of the}} manufacturing stages, such as pegging and finishing, became automated. By the 1890s, the process of mechanisation was largely complete.|$|E
50|$|In {{securing}} the previous <b>stitch</b> in a wale, the next <b>stitch</b> can {{pass through the}} previous loop either from below or above. If the former, the <b>stitch</b> is denoted as a knit <b>stitch</b> or a plain stitch; if the latter, as a purl <b>stitch.</b> The two <b>stitches</b> are related in that a knit <b>stitch</b> seen {{from one side of}} the fabric appears as a purl <b>stitch</b> on the other side.|$|R
5000|$|Different <b>stitches</b> and <b>stitch</b> {{combinations}} {{affect the}} properties of knitted fabric. Individual <b>stitches</b> look differently; knit <b>stitches</b> look like [...] "V"'s stacked vertically, whereas purl <b>stitches</b> look like a wavy horizontal line across the fabric. Patterns and pictures can be created using colors in knitted fabrics by using <b>stitches</b> as [...] "pixels"; however, such pixels are usually rectangular, rather than square. Individual <b>stitches,</b> or rows of <b>stitches,</b> may be made taller by drawing more yarn into the new loop (an elongated <b>stitch),</b> which {{is the basis for}} uneven knitting: a row of tall <b>stitches</b> may alternate with one or more rows of short <b>stitches</b> for an interesting visual effect. Short and tall <b>stitches</b> may also alternate within a row, forming a fish-like oval pattern.|$|R
50|$|Ribbing is notated by (number of knit <b>stitches)</b> &times; (number of purl <b>stitches).</b> Thus, 1&times;1 ribbing has one knit <b>stitch,</b> {{followed}} by one purl <b>stitch,</b> {{followed by}} one knit <b>stitch,</b> and so on.|$|R
