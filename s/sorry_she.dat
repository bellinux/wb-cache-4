5|$|The episode {{returns to}} the present day. Margaret prepares some orange juice and {{paracetamol}} for Glynis's migraine. She finds a scrap book of press cuttings surrounding Victor's death in Glynis's kitchen drawer and realises that her new friend is responsible for his demise. As ominous music plays, Margaret thoughtfully looks at the box of paracetamol. She drops some tablets into the glass {{and hands it to}} Glynis, who realises that her secret has been uncovered. Glynis explains that the night she was driving she had been told that her husband was close to death and wasn't concentrating on the road properly. As a result, she didn't realise she was about to hit Victor {{until it was too late}} and had stopped, but left when she saw Margaret arrive. She also tells Margaret how <b>sorry</b> <b>she</b> is and how she never meant to hurt anyone, seeking Margaret out in order to try and help her get over Victor's death. Margaret watches her drink some of the orange juice before leaving the house and driving away, with it never being revealed if she'd followed through with her promise to kill the person responsible for Victor's demise.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Lucy poems" [...] {{have been}} parodied {{numerous}} times since their first publication. These were generally intended to ridicule the simplification of textual complexities and deliberate ambiguities in poetry. They also questioned {{the way many}} 19th-century critics sought to establish definitive readings. According to Jones, such parodies commented in a [...] "meta-critical" [...] manner and themselves present an alternative mode of criticism. Among the more notable is the one by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's son Hartley Coleridge (1796–1849), called [...] "On William Wordsworth" [...] or simply [...] "Imitation", as in the 1827 version published for The Inspector magazine ("He lived amidst th' untrodden ways / To Rydal Lake that lead; / A Bard whom there were none to praise / And very few to read" [...] lines 1–4). Parody also appears in the 1888 murder-mystery reading of the poem by Victorian author Samuel Butler (1835–1902). Butler believed Wordsworth's use of the phrase [...] "the difference to me!" [...] was overly terse, and remarked that the poet was [...] "most careful not to explain {{the nature of the}} difference which the death of Lucy will occasion him to be ... The superficial reader takes it that he is very <b>sorry</b> <b>she</b> was dead... but he has not said this." [...] Not every work referring to the [...] "Lucy poems" [...] is intended to mock, however; the novelist and essayist Mary Shelley (1797–1851) drew upon the poems to comment on and re-imagine the Romantic portrayal of femininity.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2011, Osbourne {{and some}} of her fellow The Talk panelists were criticised for their conduct when {{discussing}} the story of Catherine Kieu. Osbourne described Kieu's cutting off of her husband's penis and putting it in a garbage disposal as [...] "quite fabulous", Osbourne also laughed about the incident with her fellow panellists and members of the audience. Osbourne's cohost Sara Gilbert offered the counterpoint [...] "Not to be a total buzz kill, but {{it is a little bit}} sexist. If somebody cut a woman's breast off, nobody would be sitting laughing.", Osbourne replied by saying [...] "It's different". Osbourne later apologised for her behaviour, stating [...] "she was <b>sorry</b> <b>she</b> offended people" [...] and that she [...] "did not condone genital mutilation".|$|E
2500|$|A {{worker at}} DC Central Kitchen saw Tracht's apology on TV and heard {{his desire to}} show he was <b>sorry.</b> <b>She</b> thought that the [...] "Kitchen" [...] {{would be a good}} place for him to prove himself, and shared the idea with a co-worker who knew Rock Newman; he made a phone call. Soon, Tracht was mopping floors and {{cleaning}} bathrooms for four hours a day, several times a week. He volunteered for four months, laboring with unemployed and homeless people. Of the experience, Tracht stated: [...] "It's {{the kind of place where}} you can rediscover yourself. I did things I'd never done in my life. I went in there like an idiot, and now I know how to clean and mop, how to shovel and unload, how to slice and dice." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, he {{said that}} he [...] "nearly voted" [...] for the UK Independence Party, expressing his admiration for party leader Nigel Farage and {{endorsing}} his Euroscepticism regarding the UK's membership of the European Union. In October 2016, he praised the outcome of the UK's referendum on EU membership as [...] "magnificent" [...] and said the BBC had [...] "persistently denigrated" [...] supporters of the Leave campaign. In October 2017, he stated his belief that the then recently concluded UKIP leadership election had been rigged against anti-Islam activist Anne Marie Waters. During a live performance on BBC 6 Music, he said: [...] "I was very surprised the other day—it was very interesting to me—to see Anne Marie Waters become the head of Ukip. Oh no, <b>sorry</b> <b>she</b> didn't—the voting was rigged. Sorry, I forgot." ...|$|E
