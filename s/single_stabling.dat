40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} {{conditions under}} which observers can interpolate occluded contours by a <b>single,</b> <b>stable,</b> smooth contour. Observers viewed partly-occluded contours defined by linear segments and estimated the position and tangent orientation of the contour at multiple locations within the occluded region. We measured the precision and consistency of observers’ settings as indices of successful interpolation. We found that although increasing the relative offset between inducers led to a decrease in both precision and consistency, increasing turning angle affected primarily precision. We discuss {{conditions under which}} interpolation settings are consistent with a <b>single,</b> <b>stable</b> smooth contour...|$|R

40|$|Airborne {{respirable dust}} (ARD) (< 5 mm) {{in the stable}} {{environment}} is strongly implicated in equine asthma. Bedding, forage, ventilation rate, and stable management activities all contribute to ARD. This study investigated the relationship between ARD in the breathing zone (BZ) and the stable zone (SZ) in eight American barns (ABs) and eight stable complexes with individual stables under four different management regimes. Airborne respirable dust was measured in eight replicate stables per regime in ABs (n ¼ 32) and eight per regime in <b>single</b> <b>stables</b> (n ¼ 32). Regimes were as follows: (1) steamed hay and shavings; (2) dry hay and shavings; (3) haylage and straw; and (4) dry hay and straw. Samples were taken in quite periods between 3 PM and 4 PM hours. Airborne respirable dust levels were analyzed using Split-Plot analysis of variance and Wilcoxon matched-pairs test (Genstat 15) with P <. 05 as significant. The lowest ARD (< 360 RP/L air) was found for shavings and steamed hay in AB and <b>single</b> <b>stables</b> in both BZ and SZ. Straw and dry hay in ABs produced ARD of 6, 250 (SZ), 5, 079 RP/L air (BZ) which was greater (P <. 05) than the 2, 901 (SZ) and 942 (BZ) RP/L air in <b>single</b> <b>stables.</b> Straw and haylage produced more ARD across both zones in <b>single</b> <b>stables</b> compared with ABs. Shavings and dry hay ¼ more dust in the BZ than in the SZ, whereas straw and haylage ¼ higher ARD in the SZ versus the BZ across both stable designs. Using dry hay and/or straw cannot be recommended as a suitable management regime for stabled horses...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} interest {{recently in the}} application of bagging in the classification of both gene-expression data and protein-abundance mass spectrometry data. The approach is often justified by the improvement it produces on the performance of unstable, overfitting classification rules under small-sample situations. However, the question of real practical interest is whether the ensemble scheme will improve performance of those classifiers sufficiently to beat the performance of <b>single</b> <b>stable,</b> nonoverfitting classifiers, in the case of small-sample genomic and proteomic data sets. To investigate that question, we conducted a detailed empirical study, using publicly-available data sets from published genomic and proteomic studies. We observed that, under t -test and RELIEF filter-based feature selection, bagging generally does a good job of improving the performance of unstable, overfitting classifiers, such as CART decision trees and neural networks, but that improvement was not sufficient to beat the performance of <b>single</b> <b>stable,</b> nonoverfitting classifiers, such as diagonal and plain linear discriminant analysis, or 3 -nearest neighbors. Furthermore, as expected, the ensemble method did not improve the performance of these classifiers significantly. Representative experimental results are presented and discussed in this work. </p...|$|R
