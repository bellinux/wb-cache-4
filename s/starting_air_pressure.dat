40|$|Abstract: <b>Air</b> <b>pressure</b> {{in coastal}} {{unsaturated}} aquifers fluctuates with sea tides, {{as does the}} groundwater level. Tide-induced <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> fluctuations in coastal subsurface systems, however, are not well addressed in literature. Significant diurnal <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> fluctuations are observed below the asphalt pavement in a coastal reclamation area of Hong Kong. A two-dimensional cross-sectional model is built to describe the air-water two-phase flow in the unsaturated zone of the area. TOUGH 2, a general-purpose numerical simulation program for multi-dimensional fluid and heat flows of multiphase, multicomponent fluid mixtures in porous and fracture media, is used to obtain the numerical solutions. The numerical simulation reveals that the significant <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> fluctuation results {{from a combination of}} various factors such as asphalt pavement of extremely low permeability, soil structures of the reclamation area, and rainfall intensity during spring tides. Numerical simulation also reveals that the <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> is approximately proportional to the tidal rate. A great amplitude of the sea level fluctuation will not necessarily lead to high <b>air</b> <b>pressure,</b> if the sea level changes slowly. Coastal unsaturated zones inhale and exhale as the tidal level falls and rises.
