25|$|There {{are several}} methods of {{irrigation}} {{that can be}} used in viticulture depending on the amount of control and water management desired. Historically, <b>surface</b> <b>irrigation</b> was the most common means using the gravity of a slope to release a flood of water across the vineyard. In the early history of the Chilean wine industry, flood irrigation was widely practiced in the vineyards using melted snow from the Andes Mountains channeled down to the valleys below. This method provided very little control and often had the adverse effect of over-watering the vine. An adaption of method was the furrow irrigation system used in Argentina where small channels ran through the vineyard providing irrigation. This provide slightly more control since the initial amount of water entering the channels could be regulated, however the amount that each vine received was sporadic.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} {{phases of the}} Sangam period, people {{depended}} heavily on rains as {{the primary source of}} water for agriculture. But, increasing demand stemming from a growing population {{led to the development of}} better methods of irrigation. Since the rivers of the region were not perennial, the primary goal was to procure an adequate and continuous supply of water. Tanks, lakes and dams were important water storage systems that were developed for this purpose. Sluices and shutters were constructed for regulating water for irrigation. Sometimes, buckets made of reeds were used for watering the lands. In order to control the flooding of rivers, sand mounds were raised so that water could be diverted for irrigation. Direct irrigation from canals was possible on the basins of the Kaveri, the Periyar and the Tamaraparani. Kallanai, a dam built on river Kaveri during this period, is considered the oldest water-regulation structure in the world. Kaveri, Pennai, Palaru, Vaigai and the Tamaraparani were the major rivers spreading their fertilizing water on the fields of Tamilakam. Water stored in tanks and reservoirs was delivered to the fields through channels. There is a considerable amount of spring channel irrigation in the Palar, Kaveri and Vaigai beds. To raise a second crop, well water was very useful. People of this era knew how to divine the spots where there was flow of underground water and dug wells there. Men and oxen were used to irrigate the lands from well water. When water supply was limited and demand was more, it became the duty of the village authorities to distribute the available water in a proper way. Day and night watchmen were employed to guard the tanks and reservoirs and regulate the water supply. <b>Surface</b> <b>irrigation,</b> sprinkler mechanism and drip irrigation methods were followed to prevent wastage of water.|$|E

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to research the effect of soil temperature distribution on root water uptake in soil water simulation. Soil temperature distribution patterns under border <b>irrigation</b> and <b>surface</b> drip <b>irrigation</b> were researched. The root water uptake model was modified based {{on the effect of}} soil temperature on root water uptake. Results showed soil temperature profile distribution was greatly influenced by irrigation method. The range of temperature was larger under border irrigation, with the temperature being 3 - 6 C higher in 0 - 20 cm depth than in 20 - 100 cm depth. Except for the top layer under <b>surface</b> drip <b>irrigation,</b> mean soil temperature showed the trend of exponential decay throughout the soil profile. The relationship between temperature and water uptake rate was expressed in exponential function. With the modification of the root water uptake model as affected by temperature profile distribution, the value of the root mean square error between the simulated and observed soil water decreased from approximately 0. 04 to 0. 02 in the top layer under border irrigation, but showed no obvious difference under <b>surface</b> drip <b>irrigation.</b> When soil temperature differed greatly in the top layer from the deep layer, the root water uptake model considering soil temperature could improve the precision of soil water simulation.

Soil moisture sensors could be used to improve irrigation scheduling and save both water and energy. The objective was to study the energy and water savings, and the gross margin achieved, when using an intelligent <b>surface</b> drip <b>irrigation</b> method on sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench. In the years 2008 and 2009, a study was conducted at the farm of the University of Thessaly, Central Greece. A Class A evaporation pan and an automated frequency domain reflectometry soil moisture sensor were used for irrigation scheduling.

Peasants grew turmeric plants {{in front of their}} houses and laid flower gardens in between the houses. Farmers believed that [...] ploughing, manuring, weeding, irrigation and the protection of crops must be done according to a specific method in order to obtain a good yield. A wide range of tools needed for agriculture, from ploughing to harvesting, were manufactured. The basic tool was the plough also known as meli, nanchil and kalappai. Palliyadutal referred to the process of removing weeds using a toothed implement attached to a plank and drawn by oxen. Lower-class peasants used stone sling devices to scare animals and birds away from the standing crops. Sickles were used for harvesting mature rice paddies. Since the rivers of the region were not perennial, several irrigation techniques were developed to ensure an adequate and continuous supply of water. Farmers used a bullock-propelled device called Kapilai for bailing out water from deep wells and a manual setup called Erram, for shallow wells. Tanks, lakes and dams were used as water storage systems and the water regulated using sluices and shutters.
