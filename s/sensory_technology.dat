The core primitives are step and intersection edges from images, step edges from building boundary of digital maps, patches and intersection edges from LIDAR data, and step edges from DSM generated from the LIDAR data. Then, we group these elements and refine the grouping results to generate polyhedral models of buildings. This framework was partially implemented and applied to real data.

40|$|The {{relevance}} of information fusion increases due to the complementary development of computer and <b>sensory</b> <b>technologies.</b> Information fusion basically attains {{the transformation of the}} information delivered by multiple sources into one representational form. Fuzzy systems research has generated a fruitful set of aggregation operators, which constitute a flexible alternative to operators customary used in information fusion.

The fuzzy integral was proposed as a mathematical approach for the simulation of multi-criteria evaluation taking into account some cognitive aspects, since the process of multi-criteria integration undertaken by human beings is supposed to subsume the linear combination of the criteria. The successful employment of the fuzzy integral in real applications depends on the existence of methodologies for its automated parameterization. There is a lack of efficient methods with this purpose. The here presented dissertation attains two goals.

However, despite the recent advancements in clinical trial outcomes, the path to widescale adoption of CGTs remains challenging, such that the emergence of a “blockbuster” therapy has so far proved elusive. Manufacturing solutions for these therapies require the application of scalable and replicable cell manufacturing techniques, which differ markedly from the existing pharmaceutical incumbent. Attempts to adopt this pharmaceutical model for CGT manufacture have largely proved unsuccessful. The most significant challenges facing CGT manufacturing are process analytical testing and quality control.
