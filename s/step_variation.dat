5000|$|Truckin: Truckin is a shuffle <b>step</b> <b>variation</b> popularized {{after the}} {{vaudeville}} era. The right hand is held up (as in a right turn signal) with {{the index finger}} extended and wagging. In Harlem Truckin the shoulder is set back. Feet are parallel at all times. With both feet together and facing slight left the right foot scoopes down and brushes the floor, the left foot is then gathered at the right ankle and the right heel twists (this should cause forward movement as the foot scoopes past the other foot). The action is repeated creating a [...] "hearts in the snow" [...] effect from the overlapping steps. At {{the same time the}} left hand is placed over the stomach (like a waiter holding a towel) and never really moves. The stomach twistes with the feet therefore, the [...] "stomach rubs the hand". If truckin is being done around a circle the outside hand is always up.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} of {{analysis}} of a beam that is continuously supported on a linear nonhomogeneous elastic foundation and subjected to a harmonically excited mass is presented. The solution is obtained by decomposing the nonhomogeneous foundation properties and the beam displacement response into double Fourier summations which are solved in the frequency–wavenumber domain, from which the space–time domain response can be obtained. The method is applied to railway tracks with <b>step</b> <b>variation</b> in foundation properties. The validity of this method is checked, through examples, against existing methods for both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous foundation parameters. The effect of inhomogeneity and {{the magnitude of the}} mass are also investigated. It is found that a <b>step</b> <b>variation</b> in foundation properties leads to a reduction in the beam displacement and an increase in the resonance frequency for increasing step change, with the reverse occurring for decreasing step change. Furthermore, a beam on nonhomogeneous foundation may exhibit multiple resonances corresponding to the foundation stiffness of individual sections, as the mass moves through the respective sections along the beam...|$|E

40|$|Capítulos en librosUnderfrequency {{load-shedding}} (UFLS) schemes are a last-resort tool {{to protect}} a power system {{in case of a}} severe disturbance. This paper presents a design of UFLS schemes taking into account load <b>variation,</b> affecting their <b>step</b> sizes. Most of the UFLS schemes implemented today are conventional static and semi-adaptive schemes. To date, methods for the design of these schemes consider known and constant step sizes. Step sizes might actually vary due to feeder load variation, feeder outages or breaker failures. The proposed design is formulated as a scenario-based optimization problem which is based on different <b>step</b> size <b>variation</b> scenarios. The design is applied to a Spanish small isolated power system, exhibiting strong <b>variations</b> of the <b>step</b> sizes. A UFLS scheme designed without contemplating <b>step</b> size <b>variations</b> serves as a reference case. Three different cases are analyzed that differ in the degree <b>step</b> size <b>variations</b> are taken into account. Taking into account load variations benefits the design and performance of UFLS schemes, whereas neglecting these variations results in dangerously low frequencies. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

The characterization features of sintered samples such as fracture toughness, flexural strength, hardness, relative density and electric resistance were explored through L 9 orthogonal array. By analysis of variance (ANOVA), the optimal parameter settings for each response factor were obtained and tested through confirmation experiments. The {{results indicate that the}} optimal process parameters contain 8 h crushing time of TiN powder, two ― steps sintering processes including the 1450 ¡䟴emperature with no duration for the first step and 1150 ¡䟴emperature and 20 h duration for the second step, and the average flexural strength of 736. 75 MPa and fracture toughness of 7. 545 MPa&middot;m 1 / 2 are obtained. In addition, the degree of the process parameter effects on the sintered samples is found in the series of the sintering duration of the first step, sintering <b>step</b> <b>variation,</b> size of TiN particles and the sintering temperature of the second step.

Two cases are considered: first, when the rotor of the gimbals is dynamically balanced and the second one, when this condition is not satisfied. The dynamic simulation was made using specialized software based on multibody dynamics method. An accurate characterisation of impact force versus time using specialised software requires refined meshing of the sampling interval and numerical modelling of a shock phenomenon arises as a intricate project. To avoid this aspect, the shocks were applied to the system by <b>step</b> <b>variation</b> of kinematical driving parameters. The step function was modelled using a third degree polynomial. The balanced rotor has a smoother dynamical behaviour than the unbalanced one. Keywords—gimbals dynamics, impact phenomena, multibody dynamics. A I...|$|E
