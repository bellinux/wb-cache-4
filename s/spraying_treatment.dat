40|$|The {{utilization}} of pesticides often leaves residues which potentially pollute the environment. This journal {{issue has been}} encouraging some researchers to find an environmentally friendly insecticide by a cheaper wood preservative method. The International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures 15 (ISPM 15) [1] that is adopted in wood packaging protection in Europe is not suitable for tropical countries like Indonesia. Therefore, the treatment by Organo-Complex-based wood preservation, which consists of copper chromium combined with natural organic compounds, is proposed for effective treatment at a lower cost. The bioassay test was subjected to dry wood termite Cryptotermes cynocephalus Light.

Colon cancer secreted protein- 2 (CCSP- 2) is a protein specifically expressed and secreted in colon adenomas and cancers. We developed a fluorescent imaging method based on CCSP- 2 targeting for a more sensitive and specific detection of colorectal tumors. CCSP- 2 expression was evaluated in human colon adenoma and colorectal specimens. Anti–CCSP- 2 antibody was labeled with a near-infrared fluorescent dye, FPR- 675, and molecular imaging of surgical human colorectal tumors was performed. Immunohistochemistry identified CCSP- 2 expression in 87. 0 % of colorectal cancer specimens and 89. 5 % of colon adenoma specimens. Fluorescence imaging of surgical human colon specimens after <b>spraying</b> <b>treatment</b> with the probe permitted a clear distinction of cancer from paired normal colon tissue (target-to-background ratio, 4. 09  ±  0. 42; P < . 001).

40|$|Fungal infections {{contribute}} significantly to postharvest losses of citrus fruits. Imazalil (IMZ) is currently {{the most commonly used}} fungicide that is effective for controlling postharvest fungal pathogens in citrus. IMZ is currently used in Italy as a wax emulsion for application by spraying. This system simplifies treatment, but it requires high IMZ concentrations to be effective, which result in large amounts of fungicide per unit mass of citrus fruit being applied. This paper describes tests with a pilot plant utilised to develop a method called Imazalil thin film treatment (ITFT). The method is designed {{to reduce the amount of}} fungicide used and problems related to wastewater disposal. The efficacy of three methods of fungicide application were tested, spraying, dipping and ITFT.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the bond strength of dental resin agent to zirconia ceramic after surface pre-treatment with different techniques. METHODS: Specimens of hot isostatic pressed yttriumoxide-partially-stabilized zirconia blocks (ZF) were fabricated (Procera Zir-con, Nobel Biocare, Sweden) and compared to glossy dense zirconia blocks (ZG). Four groups of specimens with different surface treatment were prepared. Group I: ZF (n = 5) and ZG (n = 5) without any pre-treatment, Group II: ZF-s (n = 5) and ZG-s (n = 5) treated with silane solution, Group III: ZF-P (n = 10) and ZG-P (n = 10) treated with RF plasma spraying (hexamethyldisiloxane) using a reactor (Plasma Electronic, Germany), Group IV: ZF-p (n = 10) and ZG-p (n = 10) treated with micro pearls of low fusing porcelain (720 degrees C) on the surfaces. Composite cylinders (Charisma, Hereus Kulzer, Dormagen, Germany) were luted with Variolink II (Ivoclar-Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) {{to the test}} specimens. The specimens were then stored in air for 1 h before shear loading in a universal testing machine (LRX, Lloyd Instruments, Farnham, England) until failure. RESULTS: No statistical difference {{was found between the}} untreated ZF and ZG specimens (Group I) neither between the specimens treated with silane (Group II).

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{vegetation}} following forest {{site preparation}} was examined in ten clearcut units {{located in the}} western Oregon Coast Range. The site preparation techniques used in these units included scarification, slash burning, and chemical spraying. The ages of the clearcut units studied varied from one to nine growing seasons for the scarification treatment, two to ten for the slash burning treatment, and two to six for the <b>spraying</b> <b>treatment.</b> The survey of the vegetation was executed {{during the summer of}} 1976. Herbaceous and shrub vegetation were characterized by biomass and cover measurements together with the identification of the three principal species in each vegetation layer. In addition, the influence of the density of the previous conifer stand on the occurrence and abundance of shrub individuals following site preparation and the activity of browsers on both planted coniferous transplants and shrub stems were examined. Results were evaluated in relation to the rate of reoccupancy of the site by herbaceous and shrub vegetation. This was used in an attempt to conceptualize the relative roles of both components of the system {{in the early stages of}} succession, and to determine the strategies of these vegetation components as secondary plant succession progresses. The vegetation on a clearcut unit is made up of several small vegetative units as a consequence of the different intensities of the site preparation method used and is, therefore, variable in structure and composition. Findings indicate that early successional trends are characterized by an increasing abundance of both herbaceous and shrub species in proportions related to the particular set of site conditions imposed by the method of site preparation. In the initial stages of succession, microenvironmental factors under the influence of herbaceous species appear to control the establishment of conifers while by the fourth year increasing influence from the sprouting shrubs usurps a controlling influence on further succession. The suppressive effect of coniferous overstory on understory development of shrubs indicates that intense brush recovery is more likely to happen on sites previously supporting conifer stands of low density. Such a trend, although variable, identifies the desirability of high stand densities on brush threat sites. Selective feeding on coniferous seedlings and on brush sprouts by deer and rodents appears to be an important consideration in long term succession. Animal populations are high in habitats conditioned by site preparation; the vegetation following scarification and slash burning appeared especially attractive to browsers while that after spraying appeared attractive to rodents. Over all, composition of perennials shortly after disturbance, especially sprouting woody species, has a major effect on long-term community development. Selective consumption by deer and rodents can delete components of low abundance, such as conifers, during the early stages of succession. Choice of site preparation method can affect both the composition and the density of woody cover and the apparent degree of animal use...|$|E

30|$|From the spectra, {{we can see}} the phonon signal band of GaAs IF has a high-energy {{side shift}} and shows an obvious {{variation}} in the shake peak numbers and intensity with increasing Sb spray time. Especially, the InAs/GaAs QD systems with the 15 -s Sb spray clearly display a decrease in shake peak numbers and a strengthening in the Raman intensity of GaAs IF signal. The results are assumed to originate from the Sb intermixing in the GaAs matrix, with varied compositions, stresses, and defects being manifested in the GaAs IF signal. Due to the lattice mismatch between InAs and GaAs, during the epitaxial growth, the strain will accumulate and result in the formation of lattice deformations or dislocations. These defects may be located in the InAs IF, inside the InAs QDs, or in the GaAs IF. Therefore, the up-shift, intensity, and peak number variations of the GaAs IF Raman signal can be explained in the following manner: during the Sb <b>spray</b> <b>treatment,</b> larger lattice constant GaAsSb is formed which results in reducing the QD/capping layer IF lattice mismatch. With the Sb spray time increased to 15 and 22.5  s, we can observe the obvious phonon signal for the Ga-Sb bonds located at the frequency of 230  cm− 1 [29, 30]. The presence of GaAsSb changes the stress distribution at the QD/cap IF, leading to a shift in the GaAs IF phonon line to higher energy. At a certain Sb <b>spray</b> <b>treatment,</b> the symmetry of the strain will achieve an optimum value, and the defects and dislocations will be reduced to a large degree. Furthermore, the uniformity of the GaAs IF In/Ga intermixing is enhanced. Therefore, the phonon signal peak of GaAs IF will be strengthened, as shown in the spectra; the 15 -s Sb <b>spray</b> <b>treatment</b> is just the case.|$|R

The treatments included concentration of nitrogen fertilizer (urea) at two levels (5 and 10 ppm) in seven levels of application time: 1) spraying at 6 - 8 - leaf stage, 2) beginning of stem elongation, 3) prior to flowering, 4) at 6 - 8 - leaf stage + beginning of stem elongation, 5) at 6 - 8 - leaf + prior to flowering, 6) beginning of stem elongation+ prior to flowering, and 7) at 6 - 8 - leaf + beginning of stem elongation+ prior to flowering, which were compared with two control treatments (no fertilizer nitrogen and conventional soil fertilization). Results showed that significant difference was observed between <b>spray</b> <b>treatments</b> including concentration and times of nitrogen application, between controls and between controls with <b>spray</b> <b>treatments,</b> of grain and oil yield, crop growth rate (CGR), leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area duration (LAD). Application of nitrogen (10 ppm) {{at the beginning of}} stem elongation+ prior to flowering stages produced maximum grain yield (4221. 7 kg/ha) and oil yield (1771. 1 kg/ha). <b>Spray</b> <b>treatments</b> produced maximum oil yield index (15. 3 %) compared to controls. Maximum LAI (6. 9 and 5. 6 respectively), CGR (15. 2 and 14. 3 g/m 2. 10 GDD, respectively) and LAD (1204 and 1029 cm 2 / 10 GDD, respectively) were also obtained from spray application of nitrogen (10 ppm) at the beginning of stem elongation+ prior to flowering stages and at 6 - 8 -leaf stage + beginning of stem elongation + prior to flowering. According to {{the results of the present}} investigation, it seems that foliar application of supplementary nitrogen fertilizer at the end growth stages (beginning of stem elongation and prior to flowering) of rapeseed plants may help to enhance growth indices, oil yield index and grain yield...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Aphis glycines Matsumura, an {{invasive}} {{insect pest}} in North American soybeans, is fed upon by a key biological control agent, Harmonia axyridis Pallas. Although biological control is preferentially relied upon to suppress insect pests in organic agriculture, approved insecticides, such as neem, are periodically utilized to reduce damaging pest populations. The authors evaluated direct <b>spray</b> <b>treatments</b> of two neem formulations, azadirachtin and neem seed oil, under controlled conditions for effects on survivorship, development time and fecundity in A. glycines and H. axyridis. RESULTS: Both azadirachtin and neem seed oil significantly increased aphid nymphal mortality (80 and 77...|$|R
