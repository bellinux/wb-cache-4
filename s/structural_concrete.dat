40|$|In this study, {{stress-strain}} {{behavior of}} <b>structural</b> lightweight <b>concrete</b> is studied under unconfined and confined conditions. To this end, {{the use of}} naturally occurring perlite material as lightweight aggregate and cement replacement material is considered. Although there are several studies on the confinement effects on normal weight concrete, there is lack of data on the confinement behavior attained for <b>structural</b> lightweight <b>concrete</b> by spiral or stirrup reinforcement. In order to evaluate the performances of <b>structural</b> lightweight <b>concrete</b> and normal weight concrete in a reliable manner, an experimental study is conducted. Through the experimental study on cylinder specimens that are unconfined and confined in different percentages by spiral reinforcement, the elastic and inelastic, namely post-peak behavior of <b>structural</b> lightweight <b>concrete</b> is recorded {{by the use of}} displacementcontrolled testing machine. The results indicate that concrete produced from perlite as lightweight aggregate as well as through the use of cement replacement material provide significant energy absorption in the presence of spiral reinforcement...|$|R
40|$|<b>Structural</b> {{lightweight}} <b>concrete</b> (SLWC) has superior {{properties that}} allow the optimization of super tall structure systems for the process of design. Because of the limited supply of lightweight aggregates in Korea, the development of <b>structural</b> lightweight <b>concrete</b> without lightweight aggregates is needed. The physical and mechanical properties of specimens that were cast using normal coarse aggregates and different mixing ratios of foaming agent to evaluate the possibility of creating <b>structural</b> lightweight <b>concrete</b> were investigated. The {{results show that the}} density of SLWC decreases as the dosage of foaming agent increases up to a dosage of 0. 6 %, as observed by SEM. It was also observed that the foaming agent induced well separated pores, and that the size of the pores ranged from 50 to 100 μm. Based on the porosity of concrete specimens with foaming agent, compressive strength values of <b>structural</b> lightweight foam <b>concrete</b> (SLWFC) were obtained. It was also found that the estimated values from proposed equations for compressive strength and modulus of elasticity of SLWFC, and values obtained by actual measurements were in good agreement. Thus, this study confirms that new <b>structural</b> lightweight <b>concrete</b> using normal coarse aggregates and foaming agent can be developed successfully...|$|R

25|$|Modern <b>structural</b> <b>{{concrete}}</b> {{differs from}} Roman concrete in two important details. First, its mix consistency is fluid and homogeneous, {{allowing it to}} be poured into forms rather than requiring hand-layering together with the placement of aggregate, which, in Roman practice, often consisted of rubble. Second, integral reinforcing steel gives modern concrete assemblies great strength in tension, whereas Roman concrete could depend only upon {{the strength of the}} concrete bonding to resist tension.|$|E
500|$|The Torre Agbar is a 38-story [...] {{skyscraper}} {{located in}} the Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes of the Poblenou neighborhood of Barcelona, Spain. Designed by Jean Nouvel, it is named after its owners, the Agbar Group, a holding company whose interests include the Barcelona water company Aigües de Barcelona. An example of high-tech architecture in the city, its design combines {{a number of different}} architectural concepts, resulting in a striking structure built with reinforced concrete, covered with a facade of glass, and over 4,500 window openings cut out of the <b>structural</b> <b>concrete.</b> The building stands out on the skyline of Barcelona; it is the third tallest building in the city, standing at 144.44m (473.88ft), with an area of over 50,000 square metres, of which 30,000 are offices. 2,500 LED bulbs cause the tower to change color at night. It was officially opened by the King of Spain on 16 September 2005. Nouvel claims it to be inspired by a geyser and the nearby mountain of Montserrat, although he does note its phallic appearance. Although many draw comparisons with the phallus, locals refer to the structure as el supositorio (the suppository), [...] a drug delivery system that is inserted into the rectum or vagina.|$|E

2500|$|Complete {{removal of}} a {{concrete}} deck is done when it is too deteriorated to keep, but the <b>structural</b> <b>concrete</b> is adequate or can be easily repaired after the hydrodemolition has taken place. It {{can also be a}} preferred alternative where a bridge deck has been compromised during initial construction but not yet open to traffic. It allows the preservation of the reinforcement while the deck concrete can be fully replaced to meet the design intent and avoid the need for potential future repairs under traffic. Precast concrete beams are often used in structures such as bridges and parking garages. Hydrodemolition has been used successfully to remove concrete over these beams, where alternate methods such as jackhammers might have caused fracture of the beams.|$|E

40|$|Cements and {{concretes}} {{are often}} considered as components of barriers for the containment of radioactive waste. The performance of such materials as mainly physical {{barriers to the}} transport of dissolved radionuclides depends on the mass transfer characteristics of the material. In particular the diffusion and sorption behaviour of the radionuclides and the water permeability are important. These parameters also influence how the chemistry of the concrete is imposed on the repository. In addition, the transport of gas through concrete controls {{the way in which}} gases escape from the repository. Diffusion and gas transport have been measured in a variety of cementitious materials, covering both <b>structural</b> <b>concretes</b> and cementitious backfills; all possible repository construction materials. Measurements have been made using aqueous iodide, strontium and caesium ions and tritiated water as diffusants. The results show that the diffusion of tritiated water is more rapid than that of other species, whilst the transport of strontium and caesium is hindered by sorption; particularly in materials containing blast furnace slag. The transport of gas in these materials {{has been found to be}} very sensitive to the degree of water saturation and is extremely low in fully saturated <b>structural</b> <b>concretes.</b> Cementitious backfills have, nevertheless, been identified that have appreciable gas transport even when almost water saturated. The consequences of the results for the performance of cementitious barriers are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{concrete}} {{is typically}} cured using external methods. External curing prevents drying of the surface, allows {{the mixture to}} stay warm and moist, and results in continued cement hydration (Taylor 2014). Internal curing is a relatively recent technique that has been developed to prolong cement hydration by providing internal water reservoirs in a concrete mixture that do not adversely affect the concrete mixture’s fresh or hardened physical properties. Internal curing {{grew out of the}} need for more durable <b>structural</b> <b>concretes</b> that were resistant to shrinkage cracking. Joint spacing for concrete overlays can be increased if slab warping is reduced or eliminated. One of the most promising potential benefits from using internal curing for concrete overlays, then, is the reduced number of joints due to increased joint spacing (Wei and Hansen 2008) ...|$|R
