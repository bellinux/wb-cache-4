5|$|By October 1951, the {{estimated}} completion date for Victoriouss modernisation {{was already a}} year past the initial estimate of April 1954. Implacable was scheduled to begin her modernisation in April 1953 for completion in 1956, but the Director of Dockyards pointed out that existing schedules prevented her from beginning any earlier than April 1955 unless the modernisations of two cruisers and the guided missile test ship RFA Girdle Ness were delayed. The Controller of the Navy asked if the time and cost of the reconstruction could be reduced, but the minimum modifications were the most expensive as they involved structural alterations. The Controller ordered the Director of Dockyards to plan for rebuilding Implacable between June 1953 and December 1956 even after the latter protested that even a limited modernisation would require about three-quarters of the <b>structural</b> <b>work</b> of the original plan and that the shortage of skilled workers (already insufficient for Victorious by herself) would delay work on both ships. In {{order to reduce the}} amount of <b>structural</b> <b>work,</b> the requirement to replace the boilers was cancelled and the ship would receive existing radars instead of systems then still under development. In January 1952, the ship's new armament was finalized at six twin-gun 3"/70 mounts and three sextuple Bofors mounts. Five months later the Admiralty decided that Victorious would be the last fleet carrier modernised as experience showed that the process would take longer and cost more than was practicable.|$|E

5|$|In 1847 Swillington, to the {{south-east}} of Leeds, {{was still}} a rural community, although mining was starting to assert itself as {{the driving force of}} the local economy. Woodford was still the Provincial Grand Chaplain in Durham, while completing <b>structural</b> <b>work</b> on his church in Yorkshire. It was not until 1854 that he joined Philanthropic Lodge No 382 (now 304). The next year he was appointed Provincial Grand Chaplain for West Yorkshire. He was master of Philanthropic in 1856 and 1858, and the lodge history asserts that it thrived during the years of his regular attendance. He re-wrote their ritual in a unique form, which was shared with five daughter and granddaughter lodges.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} the disastrous loss of four fleet carriers at the June 1942 Battle of Midway, the IJN ordered the ship's unfinished hull converted into an aircraft carrier. Her hull was only 45 percent complete by that time, with <b>structural</b> <b>work</b> complete {{up to the}} lower deck and most of her machinery installed. The main deck, lower side armor, and upper side armor around the ship's magazines had been completely installed, and the forward barbettes for the main guns were also nearly finished. The navy decided that Shinano would become a heavily armored support carrier—carrying reserve aircraft, fuel and ordnance in support of other carriers—rather than a fleet carrier.|$|E
5|$|The {{third stage}} of the Hornet Upgrade Program sought to rectify {{airframe}} damage. HUG Phase 3.1 involved minor <b>structural</b> <b>work</b> to all aircraft as they passed through other phases of the program. The centre fuselages of the ten Hornets assessed as suffering {{the greatest amount of}} structural damage were replaced in HUG Phase 3.2. It was originally intended that all the RAAF's Hornets would receive new centre fuselages, but the scope of this phase of the program was reduced after {{it was found that the}} number of man-hours needed to upgrade each aircraft was much greater than originally estimated. The ten aircraft were upgraded at an L-3 Communications facility in Canada, and all were returned to service by June 2010.|$|E

5|$|On November 26, 1967, the Chrystie Street Connection {{opened and}} D trains were rerouted via the Manhattan Bridge and the BMT Brighton Line to Coney Island. F trains were {{extended}} once again via the Culver Line. From June 1968 to 1987, the Culver Line featured express service during rush hours. F trains ran express {{in both directions}} between Bergen Street and Church Avenue, while G trains were extended from Smith–Ninth Streets to Church Avenue to provide local service. Express service on the elevated portion of the line to Kings Highway operated in the peak direction (to Manhattan AM; to Brooklyn PM), with some F trains running local and some running express. Express service between Bergen and Church ended in 1976, and between Church and Kings Highway in 1987, largely due to budget constraints and complaints from passengers at local stations. Express service on the elevated Culver Line was ended due to necessary <b>structural</b> <b>work,</b> but never restored. With the end of express service, Bergen Street's lower level {{was taken out of}} service. Following renovations to the station in the 1990s, the lower level was converted into storage space and is not usable for passenger service in its current state.|$|E

5000|$|In his {{influential}} dissertation entitled [...] "Human {{adjustment to}} floods," [...] published in 1945 by the University of Chicago Department of Geography, White argued that an overreliance on <b>structural</b> <b>works</b> in the United States had actually increased damage by flooding, rather than decreasing them. He argued famously {{in this work}} - deemed by several commentators {{to be the most}} important contribution made by a geographer in 20th-century North America (Hinshaw 2006, Kates 2007) - that [...] "Floods are an act of God, but flood losses are largely an act of man". Public confidence in <b>structural</b> <b>works</b> increased occupance of, and building on floodplains. Design standards are sometimes inappropriate, and overconfidence develops, resulting in worse disasters if a flood breaches defences. A recent and relevant example of the impacts of undue confidence in <b>structural</b> <b>works</b> can be seen in Hurricane Katrina's impact on New Orleans, during the summer of 2005. Historically, at least in the USA, works were built to certain design specifications (for example, the 100-year flood, or 1% flood). In instances where the design specifications were exceeded (in the case of a 150-year flood, etc.), they failed, thus causing catastrophic loss in overdeveloped floodplains (White et al., 1958).|$|R

It is currently undergoing renovation.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategic}} transport {{importance of the}} road bridge– {{and the threat of}} closure by 2019 if major <b>structural</b> <b>work</b> was not successful– led to fears of serious economic consequences, especially as work on a new crossing was estimated to take up to 11 years. Scottish Transport Minister Nicol Stephen commissioned a new study, which priced a second Forth Road Bridge at £300 million, in 2003. The Forth Estuary Transport Authority voiced support for a new bridge in 2005, and in 2006 the UK Transport Secretary, Alistair Darling, spoke in favour of the idea.|$|E

25|$|Construction on {{the section}} between West 9th and 19th Streets began in early 1961, but work was halted by a water main break, {{and with other}} delays the work was only twenty percent {{complete}} in July 1963.

The first section was 88 percent complete on June 30, 1965, and the second section was 99 percent complete on that date. Between West 55th and 58th Street, a third of the <b>structural</b> <b>work</b> was done by this date. No stations were constructed along the new express tracks, but provisions were incorporated into the design of the tunnel to permit the addition of future lower level stations at 14th Street and 23rd Street without disturbances to train operation.|$|E
25|$|At Lichfield Cathedral, the 18th {{century had}} been a period of decay: the 15th-century library was pulled down, most of the statues on the west front were removed, and the {{stonework}} covered with Roman cement. After some <b>structural</b> <b>work</b> early in the 19th century by James Wyatt, the ornate west front (pictured above) was restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott. It includes many ornate carved figures of kings, queens and saints, created from original materials where possible and new imitations and additions when the originals were not available. Wyatt's choir-screen had utilised medieval stone-work which Scott in turn used to create the clergy's seats in the sanctuary. A new metal screen by Francis Skidmore and John Birnie Philip to designs by Scott was installed, as was a Minton tile pavement stretching from choir screen to altar, inspired by medieval tiles found in the Choir foundations.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 {{most of the}} slates {{were removed}} to prevent more gables {{collapsing}} from pressure on the walls. Three magnolia trees are growing out of {{the foundations of the}} east wing and cover the exterior, which has lost two gables. The east wing contains a ground floor room with no windows, a concrete ceiling and a steel door which remains unopened since the estate offices closed in 1972. In September 2010, a collapse in the west wing caused further damage to the 1832 stairwell. The rooms above the parlour were destroyed as the roof and wall collapsed and the drawing room's rear wall partially collapsed. English Heritage assessed the damage as urgent and <b>structural</b> <b>work</b> was needed to prevent further collapse. In November 2011 contractors for the HTNW dismantled the north wing porch as the gable was at risk of collapse. Decorative masonry was removed for an exhibition that was held in Nelson in 2012 by the HTNW.|$|E
