25|$|Erik sets sail {{from near}} Snæfellsjökull and reaches {{the coast of}} a glacial land. He travels south along the coast searching for a {{habitable}} area. After two years of exploring the country, he returns to Iceland and tells of his discoveries. He names the land which he had explored Greenland (ON: Grœnland) because he <b>said</b> <b>people</b> would be attracted to go there if the land had a good name.|$|E
25|$|She {{said that}} there will be moments on the album that are a lot more {{intimate}} and a lot more stripped back to other tracks on the album, but these tracks show and stand out. Sandé <b>said</b> <b>people</b> didn't know what do with her, it was just her and her piano, which was very stripped, it was completely different from what everyone was used to and different from everything that was currently out. However, she stressed that it is good to be different and not predictable.|$|E

25|$|Conflict {{about the}} waters of the Jordan River was a {{contributing}} factor to the Six-Day War when, starting in 1965, Syria attempted to divert some of its headwaters in collaboration with Lebanon and Jordan. The diversion works would have reduced the water availability for Israel's carrier by about 35%, and Israel's overall water supply by about 11%. In April 1967 Israel conducted air raids into Syria to halt this work, and two months later the Six Day War followed. The use of Jordan River's water was cited as a cause of the war by Ariel Sharon, who <b>said,</b> <b>People</b> generally regard June 5, 1967, as the day the Six Day War began. That is the official date, but in reality it started {{two and a half years}} earlier on the day Israel decided to act against the diversion of the Jordan River.|$|E
25|$|Dan Sandshrew, {{the head}} of Equal Vision, {{said that there was}} a debate over the artwork for the album. Conley was unsure about what do with the artwork, and went along with Newman and Soloway's ideas. The cover artwork is of a high school party with Saves the Day shown as social outcasts sitting on a couch. The album booklet {{continues}} the outcast theme, telling a story. Sandshrew felt that cover would give the wrong impression, and Newman regretted it after the album was released. Conley <b>said</b> <b>people</b> told the band that they had sold out because the cover art featured their faces. The band, and Luke Hoverman, designed the concept with Frank Davidson providing the layout. The photographs were taken by Hoverman with assistance from Lenny Zimkus. The CD art features Gabe Saporta kissing a girl, while the back cover has actor James Ransone passed out on a couch.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} a new racino at Aqueduct Racetrack led to a {{proposal}} from Governor Andrew Cuomo to build a massive convention center in the vicinity. Talks of reactivating the line were publicly endorsed in February 2012 by Assemblymen Phillip Goldfeder and Michael G. Miller. Goldfeder commented “The commute for people here {{is only going to}} go from bad to worse. You can’t talk about a convention center without talking about transportation.” Goldfeder and Miller said they are not opposed to turning sections of the line into a park named Queensway, but <b>said</b> <b>people</b> who live in Rockaway, Ozone Park, Howard Beach, and other areas along the right-of-way have no quick or easy way to get into Manhattan. The Genting Group, which operates the racino and has been asked to construct the convention center, was evaluating several plans to increase transportation access, and was committed to paying for part of the transportation improvements. Queensway advocates are against resumption of rail service, stating that current bus service fills current transportation needs in the area.|$|E

25|$|The Tale was {{immediately}} popular and controversial. Consequently, there were rumours of various people {{as the author}} of the work— Jonathan Swift then being not largely known except for his work in the House of Lords for the passage of the First Fruits and Fifths bill for tithing. Some people thought that William Temple wrote it. Francis Atterbury <b>said</b> <b>people</b> at Oxford thought it had been written by Edmund Smith and John Philips, though he thought it was by Jonathan Swift. Some people thought it belonged to Lord Somers. However, Jonathan Swift had a cousin, also in the church, named Thomas Swift. Thomas and Jonathan were in correspondence {{during the time of the}} composition of the Tale, and Thomas Swift later claimed to have written the work. Jonathan responded by saying that Thomas had no hand in anything but the smallest of passages, and he would welcome hearing Thomas 'explain' the work, if he had written it. The controversy over authorship is aggravated by the choice of publisher. Not only did Swift use Tooke after the publication of the Tale, he had used Tooke before its publication as well, so the appearance of the work in John Nutt's shop was atypical.|$|E

Manager Juanita Johnson <b>said</b> <b>people</b> were asking to buy furniture, office equipment, and more. [...] "Some of that is older than I am." [...] The more substantial items, including the original wood lanes, had been sold off prior to demolition, while dumpster divers hit the parking lot each day, looking for any items of interest.|$|E

500|$|Ferraro {{continued}} {{to engage the}} issue and criticize the Obama campaign via her position as a Fox News Channel contributor. By early April, Ferraro <b>said</b> <b>people</b> were deluging her with negative comments {{and trying to get}} her removed from one of the boards she was on: [...] "This has been the worst three weeks of my life." [...] Ferraro stated in mid- that Clinton had [...] "raised this whole woman candidate thing to a whole different level than when I ran". She thought Obama had behaved in a sexist manner and that she might not vote for him.|$|E
500|$|The Rules of the Game premiered on Friday, July 7, 1939, at the Colisée Theatre in Paris to a {{full house}} and later at the Aubert Palace also in Paris. It was shown on a double billing with a {{patriotic}} documentary about French history. The audience at the screening consisted {{of members of the}} right-wing organisations, who booed after a while into the screening; Paulette Dubost <b>said</b> <b>people</b> at the screening fought and one person tried to set fire to the theatre. Renoir said he [...] "depicted pleasant, sympathetic characters, but showed them in a society in the process of disintegration, so that they were defeated at the onset... the audience recognized this. The truth is that they recognized themselves. People who commit suicide do not care to do it in front of witnesses." ...|$|E

500|$|After Khia {{was given}} a diminished role in the music video, {{she went to her}} MySpace account to say she was not pleased with her scenes being {{displayed}} in a TV during the music video, and criticized Jackson. Despite that, Khia said years later that the situation was calmed down, and wrote a song with Jackson in mind. However, she did not regret the feedback she gave the singer, stating, [...] "I don't say anything that I don't mean. I meant every word that I <b>said.</b> <b>People</b> mix the truth with hate, but no I didn't appreciate her putting me on the television. A lot of people blew that out of proportion like, 'Oh my god, Khia's hating on Janet,' but she called me and we were okay. It's just me voicing the situation to my fans".|$|E
500|$|The crew {{tried to}} keep CGI use to a minimum, as Anderson <b>said</b> <b>people</b> in suits and puppets are scarier than CGI monsters as they are [...] "there in the frame". Roughly 70% of scenes were created using suits, puppets, and miniatures. The Alien queen was filmed using three variations: a 4.8-meter {{practical}} version, a 1.2-meter puppet, and a computer-generated version. The practical version required 12 puppeteers to operate, and CGI tails {{were added to the}} Aliens and the queen as they were difficult to animate using puppetry. The queen alien's inner-mouth was automated though, and was powered by a system of hydraulics. Anderson praised Alien director Ridley Scott's and Predator director John McTiernan's abilities at building suspense by not showing the creatures until late in the film, something Anderson wanted to accomplish with Alien vs. Predator. [...] "Yes, we make you wait 45 minutes, but once it goes off, from there {{until the end of the}} movie, it's fucking relentless".|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} given a budget of $100 million (£58 million), the largest both HBO and the BBC had ever devoted to a series. The season was filmed between March 2004 and July 2005, at {{locations}} in or around Rome, and on a set considered [...] "to be {{the biggest and most}} expensive ever built for television." [...] It was built at Cinecittà, where the epic films Ben-Hur (1959) and Cleopatra (1963) had been filmed. Production designer Joseph Bennett built a set that emphasized authenticity and realism rather than grandiosity. He <b>said,</b> <b>People</b> think of Rome as white and cold and beautiful, powerful but distant. But based on the research, I don't think it was like that at all. If you go to Pompeii, you're struck by how garish it is, even now. The temples and sculptures were all brightly painted. Rome was like Pompeii, but much bigger. And Rome was so noisy it was impossible to sleep. It was like hell. Think of it as a combination of New York and Calcutta, with insane wealth and insane poverty. It was pretty extreme.|$|E
