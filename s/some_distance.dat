5|$|A second station, {{later called}} Shepton Mallet (Charlton Road), opened in 1874 with the {{building}} of the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. This station was <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> east of the centre of the town and was approached on the Charlton Viaduct.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} table contains <b>some</b> <b>distances</b> {{given in}} astronomical units. It includes <b>some</b> examples with <b>distances</b> that are normally not given in astronomical units, {{because they are}} either too short or far too long. Distances normally change over time. Examples are listed by increasing distance.|$|R
5|$|The station {{opened on}} 26 March 1877. Because of steep {{gradients}} near the town, {{the station was}} built in open fields <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> from the town itself. The station resembled in design Chingford railway station, opened in 1878, another GER branch line terminus.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} {{is a much}} less approachable bird than the Eurasian rock pipit. It is warier than its {{relative}} and if approached it flies <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> before landing again, whereas the rock pipit typically travels only a short distance, close to the ground, before it alights.|$|E
5|$|After {{holding off}} the initial attacks by the Byzantines, the Muslim right wing fell back, {{followed}} by the right center. They were again {{said to have been}} met by their own womenfolk who abused and shamed them. The corps, however, managed to reorganize <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> from the camp and held their ground preparing for a counterattack.|$|E

5|$|As {{the lines}} near Quebec City, the {{northern}} power line rejoins {{the other two}} 735kV power lines. The three lines, paralleled by another 735kV power line <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> to the north, span over the Saint Lawrence River to the South Shore region, where the lines form loops encompassing part of the Saint Lawrence River and the south shore. The loops are also connected to the ring of 735kV power lines around Montreal and power lines running south from James Bay.|$|E
5|$|At <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> {{back from}} the leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down and {{transitions}} to a turbulent flow. From a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have {{a large amount of}} the wing surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.|$|E
5|$|At the World Championships Chambers {{finished}} {{sixth in}} 100m final with a season's best of 10.00seconds. He {{was the only}} sprinter from outside the Americas in the final and was <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> behind Bolt who ran a world record of 9.58seconds. However, he was very pleased with his performance {{and said he was}} happy just {{to be involved in the}} fastest 100m race ever. He pulled out of the 200m with a calf injury and called an end to his season.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to develop the}} methodologies for analyzing sequences of categorical data. First the definition of sequence categorical data is defined. Then <b>some</b> <b>distances</b> scores to measure the dissimilarity between two sequences are constructed and their properties are discussed with some simulation results. These methodologies are then applied to three applications in various fields. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{country has}} no trains or trams, but {{is served by}} an extensive, privatised bus and taxi system. People {{commonly}} walk around the town, or even <b>some</b> <b>distances</b> outside it. There are few bicycles and motorcycles, but traffic congestion due to a huge increase in vehicle ownership has necessitated a major upgrade in road infrastructure.|$|R

5|$|Beginning in the {{converter}} station {{next to the}} Radisson substation, the HVDC line heads south and roughly parallels the six 735kV power lines <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> to the west. It traverses {{the same type of}} terrain as the other six lines; the land is replete with lakes, wetlands, and forested rolling hills. Gradually, the power line turns to the southeast, as it crosses under several 735kV power lines.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the palace was destroyed, {{separation}} of crown and state had become important, with Parliament being necessary to control military requirements and pass laws. The government wanted to be <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> from the monarch, and the buildings around Whitehall, physically separated from St James's Palace by St James's Park, {{seemed to be a}} good place for ministers to work.|$|E
5|$|El Chal {{was first}} {{occupied}} in the Middle Preclassic Period, with ceramics {{associated with a}} burial being recovered from the acropolis. Late Preclassic occupation has only been identified in a few residential groups in the site core. During the Preclassic {{the centre of the}} city was probably situated <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> to the northeast of the Late Classic centre, where a large ritual complex is located.|$|E
50|$|The Geography of Claudius Ptolemy also {{talks about}} Cyprus but the {{accuracy}} of this information varies for different areas of Cyprus. For example, <b>some</b> <b>distances</b> are overestimated, underestimated, or come very close to reality. Ptolemy doesn't mention any roads. Another map is the Kitchener map (1885). It is useful because it helps to distinguish older roads from the twentieth century roads.|$|R

5|$|Eland herds are {{accompanied}} by a loud clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation. It is believed that {{the weight of the}} animal causes the two halves of its hooves to splay apart, and the clicking {{is the result of the}} hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> from a herd, and may be a form of communication.|$|E
5|$|Fender fielded mainly at slip. He possessed quick {{reactions}} and could {{move quickly to}} catch balls hit <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> from him. His technique was unorthodox; he crouched low when waiting for the ball with one leg stretched behind him, like a sprinter ready to begin a race. Good catching was vital in a Surrey side which possessed weak bowling, making his contributions even more important, and critics regarded {{him as one of}} the best slip fielders in England.|$|E
5|$|File shells such as Limaria fragilis {{can produce}} a noxious {{secretion}} when stressed. It has numerous tentacles which fringe its mantle and protrude <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> from the shell when it is feeding. If attacked, it sheds tentacles in {{a process known as}} autotomy. The toxin released by this is distasteful and the detached tentacles continue to writhe which may also serve to distract potential predators.|$|E

5|$|Hull Creek {{begins in}} a pond in Scott Township. It flows {{south-southwest}} {{for more than a}} mile before turning south. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, the creek turns south-southeast, flowing through a water gap alongside Pennsylvania Route 247 and entering Blakely. After several tenths of a mile, the creek crosses a highway and flows south-southwest in a much smaller valley. After <b>some</b> <b>distance,</b> it enters Dickson City and reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} exactly why Thomas {{decided to build}} Dunstanburgh. Although it was located on a strong defensive site, it was <b>some</b> <b>distance</b> from the local settlements and other strategic sites of value. Thomas held some lands in Northumberland, but they were insignificant in comparison to his other estates in the Midlands and Yorkshire, and until 1313 he had paid them little attention.|$|E

Shorter treatment times and outpatient procedures can also help improve the efficiency of radiotherapy clinics.|$|E
