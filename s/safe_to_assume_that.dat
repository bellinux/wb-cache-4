40|$|Line-transect {{surveys are}} {{commonly}} used for sampling large mammals, but estimates of the effort needed to reliably surveying low-diversity assemblages of mammals are scarce. Using data from line-transects and species accumulation curves, I examined {{whether or not a}} sampling effort previously suggested to survey mammals elsewhere (ca. 85 - 100 km) would be satisfactory for surveying a low-diversity assemblage of large mammals in the Rio Negro basin in northern Amazonia. In total, 14 mammals were recorded after an accumulated effort of 690 km walked. The desired threshold of completeness was only achieved in one of six transects after an average effort of 115 km surveyed. Considering the entire landscape (all transects pooled), survey completeness was reached after a much higher effort. Moreover, the theoretical effort required to achieve completeness was estimated to be 150 - 360 km per transect, and 512 km for the landscape. Further studies are required to fully understand this issue, but meanwhile it is <b>safest</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> higher sampling efforts should be employed when surveying low-diversity assemblages through diurnal line-transects in northwestern Amazonia to get robust estimates of mammal richness...|$|R

60|$|There is no {{exception}} to the rule that every organic being naturally increases at so high a rate, that, if not destroyed, the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even slow-breeding man has doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in less than a thousand years, there would literally not be standing room for his progeny. Linnaeus has calculated that if an annual plant produced only two seeds--and there is no plant so unproductive as this--and their seedlings next year produced two, and so on, then in twenty years there would be a million plants. The elephant is reckoned the slowest breeder of all known animals, and I have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of natural increase; it will be <b>safest</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> it begins breeding when thirty years old, and goes on breeding till ninety years old, bringing forth six young in the interval, and surviving till one hundred years old; if this be so, after a period of from 740 to 750 years there would be nearly nineteen million elephants alive descended from the first pair.|$|R

The poll was broken out by country, and the U.S. and Australia showed the strongest opposition. Potential challenge to the UNPA are political organizations such as the U.S. Constitution Party, and politicians such as 2008 U.S. presidential candidate Ron Paul, which favor withdrawal from the United Nations and other multilateral organizations altogether due to sovereignty concerns. Canadian Action Party leader Connie Fogal also opposes the UNPA, saying, [...] "It is very revealing to see the NDP and the Greens as part of and promoting this...Further, the European assembly {{has proven to be a}} rubber stamping mechanism of bureaucratic decisions.

60|$|Subsequently to my experiments, M. Martens tried similar ones, {{but in a}} {{much better}} manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea, so that they were {{alternately}} wet and exposed to the air like really floating plants. He tried 98 seeds, mostly different from mine; but he chose many large fruits and likewise seeds from plants which live near the sea; and this would have favoured the average length of their flotation and of their resistance to the injurious action of the salt-water. On the other hand he did not previously dry the plants or branches with the fruit; and this, as we have seen, would have caused some of them to have floated much longer. The result was that 18/98 of his seeds floated for 42 days, and were then capable of germination. But I do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves would float for a less time than those protected from violent movement as in our experiments. Therefore it would perhaps be <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> the seeds of about 10/100 plants of a flora, after having been dried, could be floated across a space of sea 900 miles in width, and would then germinate. The fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than the small, is interesting; as plants with large seeds or fruit could hardly be transported by any other means; and Alph. de Candolle has shown that such plants generally have restricted ranges.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper had}} its {{beginnings}} {{in a discussion}} at the USQ Library about the necessity, or not, to provide information on the Library's website about how eBooks can or cannot be used on mobile devices, specifically eBook readers. Varying sides in the discussion had differing opinions about our students', and staff, abilities in using mobile devices and eBooks. The systems team, {{who were involved in}} the development of a mobile Library interface, and were themselves proficient users of technology, felt that students and staff needed no instruction, whilst Information Services staff felt that they did. Many Libraries have become the 'main campus resource for services for mobile devices' (Lippincott, 2010), including development of mobile interfaces and support of student use of mobile devices. At USQ, the Library is the only section at USQ with a mobile interface and the Library operates as a pseudo IT Help Desk to help students connect to mobile devices, particularly after hours. Therefore it is perhaps not wrong <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> Library staff will have the ability to troubleshoot and use mobile devices, specifically using Library applications on mobile devices. This, however, is not the actual situation. Library staff, in this world of constantly changing technologies, are constantly under pressure to adapt to and understand new technologies. This is not new. In 1978, when talking about libraries and automation, Becker stated that 'lately social and technological alternatives have occurred at so great a rate that change must be dealt with continuously'. This statement could also apply as equally to libraries in the 21 st century. Staff are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with, and become proficient users of, new technologies. It is <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> your staff do not know all about mobile devices. As one staff replied when asked what she had learned from mobile devices training, 'I learned that I'm a dinosaur!' A small project was consequently created to investigate issues relating to eBooks and mobile devices, and the best way to communicate this information to Library staff and university staff and students. This paper details the processes undertaken, some information regarding eBooks and mobile devices which we discovered, details of training delivered and lessons learned and highlights methods for promoting to and educating student about the use of eBooks and mobile devices. ...|$|R
