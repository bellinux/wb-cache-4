5|$|The Hale Commission was {{established}} by the Commonwealth of England on 30 January 1652 and led by Sir Matthew Hale to investigate law reform. Consisting of eight lawyers and thirteen laymen, the Commission met approximately {{three times a week}} and proposed changes as radical (at the time) as reducing the use of the death penalty, allowing witnesses, legal aid and lawyers for defendants in criminal cases and creating County Courts and a Court of Appeal for criminal cases. Though the Commission was unsuccessful at passing any of its measures under the Rump Parliament, two of its measures were put into law by the subsequent Barebone's Parliament, and, {{by the middle of the}} 20th century, most of the others were as well.

5|$|Some {{molecules}} or {{particles are}} too large or too hydrophilic {{to pass through}} a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical. In both cases, these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space, this process is known as exocytosis. In the reverse process, a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off, enclosing {{a portion of the}} extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism of this interdependence is the <b>sheer</b> <b>volume</b> of lipid material involved. In a typical cell, an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire plasma membrane will travel through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle in about half an hour. If these two processes were not balancing each other, the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its plasma membrane within a matter of minutes.|$|E

30|$|This {{refugee crisis}} in the {{neighborhood}} of the European Union put EU policies and institutions dealing with refugees and asylum seekers under heavy pressure to reform. The emergency humanitarian situation and the <b>sheer</b> <b>volumes</b> involved acted as stress-tests for the “Common European Asylum System” (CEAS). It is only fair to say that, by and large, the system was unable to provide appropriate responses to the new situation. In Guterres’ words: “If we fail to provide adequate support to refugees and their hosts, and to build up their resilience to cope with the long-term pressures of this increasingly protracted refugee situation, we risk a further destabilization of the entire region.” 2 Sadly enough, the CEAS remained largely virtual for a long time, prompting strong criticism of its legal framework (see De Bruycker et al., 2010); at the same time, the pressure to “do something” generated frantic policy experimentation, with a succession of spectacular but often short-lived initiatives, such as the “Mare Nostrum” operation (Fargues and Bonfanti, 2014; Fargues and Di Bartolomeo, 2015).|$|R

40|$|Peak-season {{visitors}} to Yosemite Valley know first-hand that use levels {{can affect the}} quality of their experiences in the park. The <b>sheer</b> <b>volumes</b> of vehicles and people sometimes produce long lines at entrance gates, traffic jams at intersections, full parking lots, and congested trails or viewpoints. These problems have been challenging the park’s infrastructure and operational staff for decades, but more frequently in recent years (White et al. 2012). A 2011 study of mid-summer river users in Yosemite Valley also helps quantify the general problem: 82 % report feeling some degree of crowding during their visits (Whittaker and Shelby 2012). Meta-analyses of the hundreds of studies using this same measure suggest that recreation settings with crowding levels above 65 % are probably “over capacity, ” and those above 80 % may be “greatly over capacity ” (Shelby et al. 1989; Vaske and Shelby 2008). More detailed information shows that Yosemite visitors feel more crowded while using the park’s transportation system than when participating in other activities. The percentage of those feeling crowded was highest while engaged in driving roads (90 %), finding parking (88 %), or riding free shuttles (83 %), followed by hiking or biking on trails (68 %). In contrast, crowding ratings were considerably lower for river-based activities, such as boating (60 %) ...|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} {{proponents of the}} need for more {{sustainable}} housing to be built; and yet it remains far from the norm. This research focuses on two aspects of the issue. Firstly it helps to reduce the gap in the literature specifically related to the volume housing industry in Australia and its adoption of sustainability. Volume builders are uniquely placed to promote more widespread adoption across the entire housing industry, because of their <b>sheer</b> <b>volumes</b> of production, their ability to influence smaller builders and to drive economies of scale for innovative new products and techniques. Secondly, the research provides suggestions as to what would encourage the construction of more sustainable housing. Using three major volume housing companies as case studies, Dr Martin has explored and documented these builders’ experiences in adopting sustainability principles and practices into their housing. The three organisations had each addressed sustainability in very different ways and their experiences were compared and contrasted. She has also investigated the building practitioners’ understanding of sustainability within the context of their products, and their perceptions of key drivers and barriers. In-depth qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews across a range of different roles within the three companies. The research confirmed that while sustainability was generally supported by the building practitioners, and understood reasonably well if somewhat narrowly, a number of barriers still prevent more widespread adoption. These include commonly cited barriers such as perceived increased cost and inadequate regulatory frameworks, but also include a number of internal barriers such as inadequate knowledge management systems, resourcing and lack of vision. Importantly, the findings indicate that builders’ perceptions of barriers are just as significant as whether the barriers exist in practice. Drawing on the research findings, a number of strategies to promote further uptake of sustainable housing have been presented. Some of these require implementation by builders while others will require adoption by the wider network of sustainable housing stakeholders, particularly government and industry associations. Additionally, a number of potential areas of development for sustainable housing which warrant further research are identified...|$|R
