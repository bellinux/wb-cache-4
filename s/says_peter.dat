Because of this, Observer September (Michael Cerveris) <b>says</b> <b>Peter</b> never existed. Despite this, the Observers are aware of changes in the original timeline, with echoes of Peter appearing. December (Eugene Lipinski) charges September with assuring that the last memories of Peter are wiped out. Both universes have created a secure airlock-like system around the shared room housing the Machine within the bridge. At the start of the episode, the two Olivias (Anna Torv), still somewhat distrusting of the other, help to share relevant Fringe files between the two universes.|$|E

He makes excuses not to let her use the restaurant's laptop and tells Lauren he will fake some invoices. Steven is overjoyed when Louie says his first word, [...] "mama", and gets him to say [...] "dada", filming it to show Lauren. However, she sends the video to Peter, upsetting Steven as he tells Lauren that he sees himself as Louie's father but Lauren <b>says</b> <b>Peter</b> will always be Louie's father. Steven also worries that Lauren never says she loves him when he says it to her. When Jane looks at the restaurant's accounts and realizes payments are being made to a fake company, she knows it can only be Ian or Steven but worries about confronting the wrong person. She soon discovers that Steven set up the fake company and confronts him; he explains he borrowed the money to help Peter, who was drinking heavily and getting into fights and Lauren does not know the whole truth, so Jane tells him to be honest with her. She is angry that Steven was not honest and considers visiting Peter; Steven says he wanted to protect her and Louie, and going to New Zealand out of guilt or pity will be a mistake.|$|E

6000|$|Conclusion First, That when {{persecution}} {{is raised}} against a people, {{there is a}} design laid for the ruin of those people's souls. This, I say, doth naturally follow from the exhortation. Why else, need they to commit the keeping of their souls to God. For by this word, [...] "Unto God to keep them," [...] is suggested; there is that would destroy them, and that therefore persecution is raised against them. I am not so uncharitable, as to think, that persecuting men design this. 8But I verily believe that the devil doth design this, when he stirs them up to so sorry a work. In times of trial, <b>says</b> <b>Peter,</b> [...] "your adversary the devil walketh about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour" [...] (1 Peter 5:8).|$|E

60|$|Anyway, {{that is what}} Peter Rabbit <b>says.</b> <b>Peter</b> {{never will}} forget {{the first time he}} saw Grandfather Frog. Peter was very young then. He had run away from home to see the Great World, and in the course of his wanderings he came to the Smiling Pool. Never before had he seen so much water. The most water he had ever seen before was a little puddle in the Lone Little Path. So when Peter, who was only half grown then, hopped out on the bank of the Smiling Pool and saw it {{dimpling}} and smiling in the sunshine, he thought it the most wonderful thing he ever had seen. The truth is that in those days Peter was in the habit of thinking everything he saw for the first time the most wonderful thing yet, and as he was continually seeing new things, and as his eyes always nearly popped out of his head whenever he saw something new, it is a wonder that he didn't become pop-eyed.|$|E
60|$|Do {{you think}} that love-letters are not desired between lovers? Why these, God's ordinances, they are his love-letters, and his love-tokens too. No marvel then if the righteous do so desire them: 'More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honey-comb' (Psa 19:10, 119:72-127). Yea, this {{judgment}} wisdom itself passes upon these things. 'Receive,' saith he, 'my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. For wisdom is better than rubies: {{and all the things}} that may be desired, are not to be compared to it' (Prov 8:10,11). For this cause therefore are the ordinances of God so much desired by the righteous. In them they meet with God; and by them they are builded, and nourished up to eternal life. 'As new born babes,' <b>says</b> <b>Peter,</b> 'desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby' (1 Peter 2:2). As milk is nourishing to children, so is the word heard, read, and meditated on, to the righteous. Therefore it is their desire.|$|E

These people have kings, some greater than others, and they war occasionally among themselves, with bows and arrows, or lances sharpened and hardened in the fire.

6000|$|Answ. I will in {{this place}} give you five. 1. Consider that God thinks meet to have it so, and he is wiser in heart than thou; he knows best how to secure his people from sin, and to that end hath given them law and commandments to read, that they may learn to fear him as a Father (Job 37:24; Eccl 3:14; Deut 17:18,19). 2. Consider he is mighty in power; if he touch but with a fatherly touch, man nor angel cannot bear it; yea, Christ makes use of that argument, he [...] "hath power to cast into hell; Fear him" [...] (Luke 12:4,5). 3. Consider that he is everywhere; thou canst not be out of his sight or presence; nor {{out of the reach}} of his hand. [...] "Fear ye not me? saith the Lord." [...] "Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the Lord. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord" [...] (Jer 5:22, 23:24). 4. Consider that he is holy, and cannot look with liking upon the sins of his own people. Therefore, <b>says</b> <b>Peter,</b> be [...] "as obedient children, not {{fashioning}} yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance, but as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation, because it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy.

Consider that he is good, and has been good to thee, good in that he hath singled thee out from others, and saved thee from their death and hell, though thou perhaps wast worse in thy life than those that he left when he laid hold on thee.

6000|$|It {{will be no}} {{difficult}} part to persuade the reader that so many worthy discoveries met with great success in the world; though I may justly assure him that I have related much the smallest number; my design having been only to single out such as will be of most benefit for public imitation, or which best served to give {{some idea of the}} reach and wit of the inventor. And therefore it need not be wondered if by this time Lord Peter was become exceeding rich. But alas! he had kept his brain so long and so violently upon the rack, that at last it shook itself, and began to turn round for a little ease. In short, what with pride, projects, and knavery, poor Peter was grown distracted, and conceived the strangest imaginations in the world. In the height of his fits (as it is usual with those who run mad out of pride) he would call himself God Almighty, and sometimes monarch of the universe. I have seen him (says my author) take three old high-crowned hats, and clap them all on his head, three storey high, with a huge bunch of keys at his girdle, and an angling rod in his hand. In which guise, whoever went to take him by the hand in the way of salutation, Peter with much grace, like a well-educated spaniel, would present them with his foot, and if they refused his civility, then he would raise it as high as their chops, and give them a damned kick on the mouth, which hath ever since been called a salute. Whoever walked by without paying him their compliments, having a wonderful strong breath, he would blow their hats off into the dirt. Meantime his affairs at home went upside down, and his two brothers had a wretched time, where his first boutade was to kick both their wives one morning out of doors, and his own too, and in their stead gave orders to pick up the first three strollers could be met with in the streets. A while after he nailed up the cellar door, and would not allow his brothers a drop of drink to their victuals {95}. Dining one day at an alderman's in the city, Peter observed him expatiating, after the manner of his brethren in the praises of his sirloin of beef. [...] "Beef," [...] said the sage magistrate, [...] "is the king of meat; beef comprehends in it the quintessence of partridge, and quail, and venison, and pheasant, and plum-pudding, and custard." [...] When Peter came home, he would needs take the fancy of cooking up this doctrine into use, and apply the precept in default of a sirloin to his brown loaf. [...] "Bread," [...] says he, [...] "dear brothers, is the staff of life, in which bread is contained inclusive the quintessence of beef, mutton, veal, venison, partridge, plum-pudding, and custard, and to render all complete, there is intermingled a due quantity of water, whose crudities are also corrected by yeast or barm, through which means it becomes a wholesome fermented liquor, diffused through the mass of the bread." [...] Upon the strength of these conclusions, next day at dinner was the brown loaf served up in all the formality of a City feast. [...] "Come, brothers," [...] said Peter, [...] "fall to, and spare not; here is excellent good mutton {96}; or hold, now my hand is in, I'll help you." [...] At which word, in much ceremony, with fork and knife, he carves out two good slices of a loaf, and presents each on a plate to his brothers. The elder of the two, not suddenly entering into Lord Peter's conceit, began with very civil language to examine the mystery. [...] "My lord," [...] said he, [...] "I doubt, with great submission, there may be some mistake." [...] "What!" [...] <b>says</b> <b>Peter,</b> [...] "you are pleasant; come then, let us hear this jest your head is so big with." [...] "None in the world, my Lord; but unless I am very much deceived, your Lordship was pleased a while ago to let fall a word about mutton, and I would be glad to see it with all my heart." [...] "How," [...] said Peter, appearing in great surprise, [...] "I do not comprehend this at all;" [...] upon which the younger, interposing to set the business right, [...] "My Lord," [...] said he, [...] "my brother, I suppose, is hungry, and longs for the mutton your Lordship hath promised us to dinner." [...] "Pray," [...] said Peter, [...] "take me along with you, either you are both mad, or disposed to be merrier than I approve of; if you there do not like your piece, I will carve you another, though I should take that to be the choice bit of the whole shoulder." [...] "What then, my Lord?" [...] replied the first; [...] "it seems this is a shoulder of mutton all this while." [...] "Pray, sir," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Peter,</b> [...] "eat your victuals and leave off your impertinence, if you please, for I am not disposed to relish it at present;" [...] but the other could not forbear, being over-provoked at the affected seriousness of Peter's countenance. [...] "My Lord," [...] said he, [...] "I can only say, that to my eyes and fingers, and teeth and nose, it seems to be nothing but a crust of bread." [...] Upon which the second put in his word. [...] "I never saw a piece of mutton in my life so nearly resembling a slice from a twelve-penny loaf." [...] "Look ye, gentlemen," [...] cries Peter in a rage, [...] "to convince you what a couple of blind, positive, ignorant, wilful puppies you are, I will use but this plain argument; by G---, it is true, good, natural mutton as any in Leadenhall Market; and G--- confound you both eternally if you offer to believe otherwise." [...] Such a thundering proof as this left no further room for objection; the two unbelievers began to gather and pocket up their mistake as hastily as they could. [...] "Why, truly," [...] said the first, [...] "upon more mature consideration"--"Ay," [...] says the other, interrupting him, [...] "now I have thought better on the thing, your Lordship seems to {{have a great deal of}} reason." [...] "Very well," [...] said Peter. [...] "Here, boy, fill me a beer-glass of claret. Here's to you both with all my heart." [...] The two brethren, much delighted to see him so readily appeased, returned their most humble thanks, and said they would be glad to pledge his Lordship. [...] "That you shall," [...] said Peter, [...] "I am not a person to refuse you anything that is reasonable; wine moderately taken is a cordial. Here is a glass apiece for you; it is true natural juice from the grape; none of your damned vintner's brewings." [...] Having spoke thus, he presented to each of them another large dry crust, bidding them drink it off, and not be bashful, for it would do them no hurt. The two brothers, after having performed the usual office in such delicate conjunctures, of staring a sufficient period at Lord Peter and each other, and finding how matters were like to go, resolved not to enter on a new dispute, but let him carry the point as he pleased; for he was now got into one of his mad fits, and to argue or expostulate further would only serve to render him a hundred times more untractable.|$|E
