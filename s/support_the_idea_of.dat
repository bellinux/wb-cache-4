5|$|When Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are {{watching}} Itchy & Scratchy, Marge says {{they watch the}} same episodes all the time, while Lisa says that the Itchy & Scratchy cartoons are just pasted together from pieces of old episodes. This comment is a joke about the construction of this episode; the blackboard and couch gags are taken from other episodes, there are clips from past episodes, and the interstitials are actually clips from past episodes that feature the family members talking in the kitchen. These three aspects <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> this episode being a clip show to the extreme.|$|E
5|$|The poem's {{focus on}} France {{served as a}} way for Southey to discuss his {{feelings}} about the French Revolution. In particular, Southey was upset that the British were calling men from their farms to serve as a militia during the time. In terms of the French, Southey did not support Robespierre and the others who followed him in France. However, he did <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the French Republic. When he heard of Marie Antoinette's execution in October 1793, Southey told his friend Bedford that he condemned the action although he held to his Republican beliefs. However, he was further upset when word came that Brissot, the Girondin leader, was executed. This caused him to believe that all of the countries were equally bad, except the Republican United States, which he hoped to make his home. In 1794, many of Southey's feelings on Robespierre's involvement in these actions were included in both Joan of Arc and the Fall of Robbespierre, which followed after Robespierre's own execution. However, Southey had by then become very radical and believed that Robespierre was a great man who only helped mankind in his actions.|$|E

5|$|The {{predicted}} {{effects of}} the FairTax {{are a source of}} disagreement among economists and other analysts. According to Money magazine, while many economists and tax experts <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a consumption tax, many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a consumption tax (the FairTax is one such tax) would {{have a positive effect on}} economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} year of the operation, the massive scope of full {{excavation}} and raising was beginning to take its toll on those closely involved in the project. In May 1981, Alexander McKee voiced concerns about the method chosen for raising the timbers and openly questioned Margaret Rule's position as excavation leader. McKee felt ignored in what he viewed as a project where he had always played a central role, both as the initiator of the search for the Mary Rose and other ships in the Solent, and as an active member throughout the diving operations. He had several supporters who all pointed to the risk of the project's turning into an embarrassing failure if the ship were damaged during raising operations. To address these concerns it was suggested that the hull should be placed on top of a supporting steel cradle underwater. This would avoid the inherent risks of damaging the wooden structure if it were lifted out of the water without appropriate <b>support.</b> <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> using nylon strops was also discarded in favour of drilling holes through the hull at 170 points and passing iron bolts through them to allow the attachment of wires connected to a lifting frame.|$|E

25|$|Guitarist Peter Banks did not <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{adding an}} {{orchestra}} to the album, resulting in increased tensions {{between himself and}} the rest of the group. During their UK tour in April 1970 and before the album's release, Banks was fired from Yes and was soon replaced by Steve Howe. The UK album cover was considered inappropriate for the American market, so a new photograph of the band was used, putting Howe on the cover of an album on which he did not appear.|$|E
25|$|Jordanes {{stated that}} Getae {{are the same}} as the Goths, on the {{testimony}} of Orosius Paulus. A controversial passage identifies the ancient people of Venedi mentioned by Tacitus, Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy, with the Slavs of the 6th century. As early as 1844, it has been used by eastern European scholars to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the existence of a Slavic ethnicity long before the last phase of the Late Roman period. Others have rejected this view, based on the absence of concrete archaeological and historiographical data.|$|E

25|$|Practitioners of {{homeopathy}} {{hold that}} higher dilutions―described as being of higher potency―produce stronger medicinal effects. This idea is also inconsistent with observed dose-response relationships, where effects {{are dependent on}} the concentration of the active ingredient in the body. This dose-response relationship has been confirmed in myriad experiments on organisms as diverse as nematodes, rats, and humans. Some homeopaths contend that the phenomenon of hormesis may <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> dilution increasing potency, but the dose-response relationship outside the zone of hormesis declines with dilution as normal, and nonlinear pharmacological effects do not provide any credible support for homeopathy.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Spanish Americans continued to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> maintaining a monarchy under Ferdinand VII, {{but did not}} support retaining absolute monarchy. Spanish Americans wanted self-government. The juntas in the Americas did not accept {{the governments of the}} Europeans – neither the government set up for Spain by the French nor the various Spanish Governments set up in response to the French invasion. The juntas did not accept the Spanish regency, isolated under siege in the city of Cadiz (1810–1812). They also rejected the Spanish Constitution of 1812 although the Constitution gave Spanish citizenship to natives of the territories that had belonged to the Spanish monarchy in both hemispheres.|$|E
25|$|This {{view has}} been {{challenged}} by JE Pattison, who suggested that the Y-chromosome evidence could still <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a small settlement of people without the apartheid-like structures. In addition, there is no reliable method for dating the influx of genetic material into Britain from the Continent; and the genetic similarities between people {{on either side of}} the North Sea may reflect a cumulative process of population movement, possibly beginning well before the historically attested formation of the Anglo-Saxons or the invasions of the Vikings. The 'apartheid theory' has received a considerable body of critical comment, especially the genetic studies from which it derives its rationale. Problems with the design of Weale's study and the level of historical naivete evidenced by some population genetics studies have been particularly highlighted.|$|E

25|$|Other {{scholars}} {{argue that}} the doors were in Hildesheim Cathedral from the beginning, in the westwork which is otherwise held to have first been built in 1035. Although the current west gallery has only been there since 1035, they argue that Bernward had already laid down a west building here, whose shape and appearance {{can no longer be}} reconstructed with confidence. Either Bernward would have had the previous west choir and the crypt underneath truncated to create space for a vestibule, where the Bernward Doors might have been installed or he would have had the west choir extended and installed the doors in the entrance to a chapel, which would have been built in front of the apse. Only a few hints in the foundations <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a Bernwardian west gallery in the cathedral and they allow no more detailed conjecture about its layout.|$|E

500|$|After this, {{tensions}} between the Nazis and austrofascists worsened, culminating in the July Putsch of 1934, when Nazis attempted to overthrow the government. Whilst they managed to assassinate chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, the putsch was quickly crushed by the police, army, and Heimwehren. In {{the aftermath of the}} putsch, conflict between the Social Democrats and the ruling austrofascists led to the Austrian Civil War later in the year. After their defeat, the Social Democratic Party was outlawed entirely. This, in tandem with a continued a campaign of violence and propaganda by the Nazis, destabilised the austrofascist regime, and rallied many to <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Anschluss.|$|E
