40|$|Multi-criteria {{decision}} making (MCDM) {{is an area}} that is often discussed in operations research (OR). It is able to handle problems involving multiple criteria, and produce meaningful and quality {{decision making}}, especially in selecting the best alternative. This paper is aimed at reviewing the applications of MCDM for technical evaluation <b>of</b> <b>tenderers.</b> It identifies the problems that often occur in technical evaluation <b>of</b> <b>tenderers.</b> The MCDM techniques that have been employed to address these problems are then discussed, along with their benefits and limitations. Based on the review conducted, it can be suggested that analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is the most practical MCDM method for technical evaluation <b>of</b> <b>tenderers,</b> as it provides a fair and open process of assessment by taking into consideration the evaluators involved to avoid the issue of bias, and can be carried out with simplicity and transparency. Nonetheless, studies on other MCDM methods should be further explored due to the limitations of AHP...|$|R
40|$|Procurement auctions may be {{affected}} by abnormally low bids, whose acceptance may have negative consequences on the auctioneer. A method, based on the average submitted bid, is considered to detect such anomalous bids and aid the auctioneer in the possible rejection decision. Analytical expressions or simulation results are provided for the detection probability and for the false alarm probability. The performances heavily depend on the number <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> and on the dispersion of bid values. Both performance indices improve as the number <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> grows and generally degrade as the dispersion grows. The presence of multiple anomalous bids leads to a significant worsening of the performance, while courtesy bids raise both the false alarm probability and the detection probability. The use of the average-bid criterion, though officially endorsed in national legislations, is therefore recommended as a strongly precautionary criterion, i. e. when the need to avoid anomalous bids is considered much more relevant than the costs associated to deeper investigation of anomalous bids or to the erroneous rejection of regular bids.

40|$|The overall {{question}} of when amendments to an existing agreement are {{to be regarded as}} constituting a new award of a public contract has not come before the ECJ. The Pressetext case and decision’s practice in the Czech Republic has solved this question: In order to ensure transparency of procedures and equal treatment <b>of</b> <b>tenderers,</b> amendments to provisions of a public contract during the currency of the contract constitute a new award of a contract when they are materially different in character from the original contract and, therefore, are such as to demonstrate the intention of the parties to renegotiate the essential terms of that contract. We can say that for this purpose an amendment to a public contract may be regarded as ‘material’ when: it introduces conditions which, had they been part of the initial award procedure, would have allowed for the admission <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> other than those initially admitted, or would have allowed for the acceptance of a tender other than the one initially accepted, it extends the scope of the contract considerably to encompass services not initially covered and it changes the economic balance of the contract in favour of the contractor in a manner which was not provided for in the terms of the initial contract...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} {{study in which}} the rights <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> and contractors and related procurement regulations are discussed and compared under Saudi public procurement contract regulations and those of England and Wales. This thesis does not aim to be a comprehensive comparative study, but presents examples to illustrate the issues under discussion. A central aim {{of the study is}} to consider whether Saudi public procurement contract regulations are suitable to protect the rights <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> and contractors and to solve their problems in the rapid development of the country. Is the Purchasing Law, in particular, able to cover the rapid development in procurement and the economy in Saudi Arabia and the world? This question is asked in order to examine the weaknesses of current procurement regulations and to explore procurement claims that the Purchasing Law fails to address tenderers' and contractors' rights and concerns. Many criticisms have been raised regarding Saudi public procurement contract regulations, especially the Saudi Purchasing Law. Although the Saudi government has called for the procurement sector to play a greater role in national development, the Purchasing Law does not support this aim. It has remained unchanged since it was enacted in 1979, despite rapid economic changes in the country. Contractors, traders, banks, and Saudi Chambers of Commerce have complained that they are too constrained by the provisions of the Purchasing Law. The ten chapters of this thesis examine the rights <b>of</b> procurement <b>tenderers</b> and contractors throughout the procedures to prepare and award a public procurement contract. In addition to identifying the principles of procurement regulations, this study investigates the rights <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> and contractors from the first steps of tendering procedures to the awarding of the contract and afterwards. Once the contracting authority selects a successful contractor this study highlights his rights to obtain his financial payment and to obtain remedy if the contracting authority breaches its contractual obligations. The study examines case law, procurement regulations, circulars and governmental procedures in procurement. The study results indicate that Saudi public procurement contract regulations in general and the Purchasing Law in particular are inadequate to keep pace with development requirements in the country. More specifically, the findings show that current Saudi procurement regulations are in fact obstacles {{to the development of the}} procurement sector, and a main reason for contractors' unwillingness to enter the governmental procurement market.

40|$|As E-government {{continues}} to develop with ever-increasing speed, {{the requirement to}} enhance traditional government systems and affairs with electronic methods that are more effective and efficient is becoming critical. As a new product of information technology, E-tendering is becoming an inevitable reality owing to its efficiency, fairness, transparency, and accountability. Thus, developing and promoting government E-tendering (GeT) is imperative. This paper presents a hybrid approach combining genetic algorithm (GA) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to enable GeT {{to search for the}} optimal tenderer efficiently and fairly under circumstances where the attributes <b>of</b> the <b>tenderers</b> are expressed as fuzzy number intuitionistic fuzzy sets (FNIFSs). GA is applied to obtain the optimal weights of evaluation criteria <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> automatically. TOPSIS is employed to search for the optimal tenderer. A prototype system is built and validated with an illustrative example from GeT to verify the feasibility and availability of the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|Detecting {{abnormally}} low bids in procurement auctions is {{a recognized}} problem, since their acceptance {{could result in}} the winner not being able to provide the service or work awarded by the auction, which is a significant risk for the auctioneer. A rank-and-compare algorithm is considered to detect such anomalous bids and help auctioneers in achieving an effective rejection decision. Analytical expressions and simulation results are provided for the detection probability, {{as well as for the}} false alarm probability. The suggested range of application of the detection algorithm leaves out the cases <b>of</b> many <b>tenderers</b> (more than 20) and quite dispersed bids (coefficient of variation larger than 0. 15). An increase in the number <b>of</b> <b>tenderers</b> leads to contrasting effects, since both the false alarm probability and the detection probability are reduced. If the bids are spread over a large range, we have instead a double negative effect, with more false alarms and less detections. The presence of multiple anomalous bids worsens the performance of the algorithm as well. On the other hand, the method is quite robust to the presence of courtesy bids. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
