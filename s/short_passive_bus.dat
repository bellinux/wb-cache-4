40|$|This {{paper has}} three goals: {{to show that}} the Mandarin bei is a unified construction, to explore a {{universal}} characterization of the passive, and then to demonstrate that the bei construction is a genuine passive. The bei construction comes in two forms, one with an overt agent, known as the long passive, and the other without, known as the <b>short</b> <b>passive.</b> Previous accounts assign two very different structures to the two forms and posit two lexically different bei’s. This paper, however, based largely on newly discovered natural occurring data in Taiwan Mandarin, demonstrates that bei behaves rather similarly with or without an overt agent and thus dismisses the <b>short</b> <b>passive</b> and argues for a unified bei. Specifically, the bei construction is analyzed, within the Lexical-Functional Grammar, as the passive counterpart of the active ba construction. The paper then explores a universal characterization of the passive and a typology of the syntactic assignment of the demoted agent, and it demonstrates that bei’s agent phrase, demoted to object, is in line with the universal characterization of passive...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to defend the {{complementation}} approach to Chinese passives and discuss its consequences. Four interesting issues related to Chinese passives ai e examined. (a) the categorial status of bei in Chinese passives (b) the possibility of having an empty agent argument, (c) sub-categorization of passive verbs and their grammatical status, and (d) the function of gei in passive and nonpassive sentences. The findings of this paper are as follows. First of all, it is argued that bei is not a preposition in Chinese long passives and is not a <b>passive</b> morpheme in <b>short</b> <b>passives.</b> Second, assuming that the complementation approach is on the right trade, it is argued that Chinese long passives are ECM structures. Hence, the embedded agent argument can be neither pro nor PRO. The agent argument cannot be a trace either, because movement will be blocked by a null operator adjoined to the embedded clause. Third, after comparing several passive verbs in Mandarin and Cantonese, it is observed that only the passive verbal elements that are less lexical, more functional may enter <b>short</b> <b>passives.</b> Fourth, it is argued that preverbal gel is a marker that marks affectedness, which has nothing to do with passivization. The occurrence of gel in various apparently unrelated contexts is explained under a unified account. Department of Mechanical EngineeringDepartment of Chinese and Bilingual Studie...|$|R

We have investigated the possibility to obtain the monomode operation of the active ring waveguide for certain ring radius values by the selective attenuations of the higher order modes and the obtaining of the desired coupling efficiency by varying the technological parameters like the layers thickness, etching depth, bus waveguide width and the offset (misalignment between the ring and the bus waveguide). Depending on the fabrication method, the misalignment between the ring resonator and the bus waveguide may vary within a significant range. Therefore, we considered a much wider bus waveguide in the coupling region in order to minimise the effects of misalignment...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} visual {{experience}} is usually investigated through active (task dependent) training in a discrimination task. In contrast, the current work explored the psychophysical and electrophysiological correlates of passive (task independent) visual experience in texture segmentation {{by using an}} inattentional blindness-like paradigm (Mack et al., 1992). The psychophysical and electrophysiological responses to a segmented line-texture bar, with texture elements oriented either congruently (parallel) or noncongruently (orthogonal) to bar orientation, were collected after both <b>short</b> and long <b>passive</b> experience, with the texture presented on the background while subjects performed a primary task. Subjects {{were not able to}} distinguish the orientation of the bar (psychophysical results) after either <b>short</b> or long <b>passive</b> experience. However, the short experience produced an electrophysiological correlate of texture segmentation (N 150), and the amplitude of this component was greater for the parallel bar, demonstrating that it reflected not simply local orientation discontinuities but also texture boundary–surface orientation congruency. This configurational effect in texture segmentation, which occurred without awareness during passive viewing, disappeared when the subjects had previously discriminated the orientation of the bar and when experience was lengthened, probably as a consequence of adaptation. Our study provides the first ERP evidence that boundary–surface relations are available during <b>short</b> <b>passive</b> visual experiences of very salient texture images and are suppressed by long experience, probably because of adaptation...|$|R
40|$|This paper revisits the categorial {{status of}} the Mandarin passive marker bei and the derivational {{relationship}} between long and <b>short</b> bei <b>passives.</b> In regard to its categorial status, {{there have been three}} major analyses: bei is a preposition, or is a verb, or it has the dual status of being both a verb and a preposition. This paper reviews these views, especially the latter two, pointing out their strengths and weaknesses. On this basis, it makes three claims. (a) Bei is a verb, which is supported by the new evidence from reflexive ziji tests, Chinese fragmentary constructions, and the chameleonic properties of the bei passive alternating between control and raising structures. (b) As for the structures of the long and <b>short</b> <b>passives,</b> by reviewing the uniform and non-uniform approaches, we provide the third approach, arguing that long passives can be further divided into local long and long-distance passives. The local long passive and its corresponding short form may be derivationally related, while the long-distance passive does not have a short form. (c) By reinterpreting the facts from some negation tests, we argue that the semi-lexical verb bei subcategorizes for a non-finite clause that does not involve Aspect phrase (AspP) or Currently Relevant State phrase (CrsP).

The analysis of the data shows an asymmetry between actional and non-actional passives, namely the former are easier to comprehend than the latter. Long passives are not significantly different from <b>short</b> <b>passives.</b> The most interesting results concern the role of the variable ‘auxiliary’ in the comprehension of passive sentences.

40|$|Sentences such as The {{ship was}} sunk {{to collect the}} {{insurance}} exhibit an unusual form of anaphora, implicit control, where neither anaphor nor antecedent is audible. The nonfinite reason clause has an understood subject, PRO, that is anaphoric; here it may be understood as naming the agent of the event of the host clause. Yet since the host is a <b>short</b> <b>passive,</b> this agent is realized by no audible dependent. The putative antecedent to PRO is therefore implicit, which it normally cannot be. What sorts of representations subserve the comprehension of this dependency? Here we present four self-paced reading time studies directed at this question. Previous work showed no processing cost for implicit versus explicit control, and took this to {{support the view that}} PRO is linked syntactically to a silent argument in the passive. We challenge this conclusion by reporting that we also find no processing cost for remote implicit control, as in: The ship was sunk. The reason was to collect the insurance. Here the dependency crosses two independent sentences, and so cannot, we argue, be mediated by syntax. Our Experiments 1 - 4 examined the processing of both implicit (<b>short</b> <b>passive)</b> and explicit (active or long passive) control in both local and remote configurations. Experiments 3 and 4 added either three days ago or just in order to the local conditions, to control for the distance between the passive and infinitival verbs, and for the predictability of the reason clause, respectively. We replicate the finding that implicit control does not impose an additional processing cost. But critically we show that remote control does not impose a processing cost either. Reading times at the reason clause were never slower when control was remote. In fact they were always faster. Thus efficient processing of local implicit control cannot show that implicit control is mediated by syntax; nor, in turn, that there is a silent but grammatically active argument in passives...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an account of}} bei-passives in Mandarin Chinese {{within the framework of}} Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG). I propose treating bei-passives as a type of long-distance dependency (LDD) construction analogous to English tough-type sentences, and discuss the merits of this analysis. Recent research on the topic has generally concluded that “short” and “long” passives have separate derivations (Huang, Li, & Li 2009). Since this account can be challenged upon grounds of desired theoretical simplicity and explanatory adequacy, one desired outcome is a uniform derivation of bei-sentences. The LDD analysis proposed here is able to account for the defining properties of long bei-passives, including unbounded dependencies and resumptive pronouns. I also argue that the unique control structure of “adversative passives” can be explained naturally by an LDD structure. However, certain differences between <b>short</b> <b>passives</b> and long passives cannot be completely accounted for under the present account, and should encourage further inquiry...|$|R

Our results show that referentiality and implicitness of arguments interact with ϑ-role assignment in agrammatic comprehension of passive constructions.

Markings are obtained under industrial conditions with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser on a X 30 C 13 martensitic stainless steel. Depending on laser parameters, two modes of marking are considered: a surface oxidisation mode and a matter photoablation mode. Electrochemical behaviour, i. e. passive state, corrosion rate, resistance to pitting, is evaluated in Ringer's saline solution. Results are then explained on the basis of metallurgical modifications regarding the phases composition and the distribution of alloying elements. In oxidative regime, laser treatment drastically affects both microstructure and chemical composition. Specially, chromium depletion is measured in subsurface, leading to a loss of passive ability. In ablative mode the surface is transformed into a thin favourable layer of austenite. Moreover, the overall chromium distribution is little modified.

40|$|Classes of {{performance}} measures {{expressed in terms}} of H_ 2 -norms have been recently introduced to quantify the response of coupled dynamical systems to external perturbations. For the specific case of electric power networks, these measures quantify for instance the primary effort control to restore synchrony, the amount of additional power that is ohmically dissipated during the transient following the perturbation or, more conceptually, the coherence of the synchronous state. So far, investigations of these performance measures have been restricted to nodal perturbations. Here, we go beyond earlier works and consider the equally important, but so far neglected case of line perturbations. We consider a network-reduced power system, where a Kron reduction has eliminated passive buses. Identifying the effect that a line fault in the physical network has on the Kron-reduced network, we find that performance metrics depend on whether the faulted line connects two passive, two active buses or one active to one <b>passive</b> <b>bus.</b> In all cases, performance metrics depend quadratically on the original load on the faulted line times a topology dependent factor. Our theoretical formalism being restricted to Dirac-δ perturbations, we investigate numerically the validity of our results for finite-time line faults.

40|$|Retroactive {{interference}} (RI) —the disruptive {{influence of}} events occurring after {{the formation of}} a new memory—is one of the primary causes of forgetting. Placing individuals within an environment that postpones interference should, therefore, greatly reduce the likelihood of information being lost from memory.

To test this hypothesis, participants took part in a foreign language learning activity and were shown English translations of 20 Icelandic words for immediate recall. Half of the participants were then given an 8 -min rest before completing a similar or dissimilar interfering distractor task. The other half did not receive a rest until after the distractor task, at which point interference had already taken place. All participants were then asked to translate the Icelandic words for a second time. Results revealed that retention was significantly worse at the second recall test, but being allowed a brief rest before completing the distractor task helped reduce the amount of forgetting.
