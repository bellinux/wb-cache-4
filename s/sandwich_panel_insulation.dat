40|$|At this time, {{just a few}} {{requirements}} {{have been}} introduced in Italy about the summer performance of buildings, one among them concerning the maximum allowed value for the periodical thermal transmittance of opaque building elements. In fact, it is generally assumed that thermal cycles induced by solar radiation at the external surfaces can be substantially damped through the thickness of roofs and walls thanks to properly low values of their periodic thermal transmittance. The result is generally achieved by giving roofs and walls an adequate levels of either thermal insulation or thermal inertia, but this is generally reflected in {{the adoption of a}} high surface mass and makes it difficult to use wooden roofs, plasterboard structures or <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> with foam <b>insulation.</b> However, using an outer coating with high solar reflectance, identified with the terms of cool roof or cool color in the technical nomenclature used in the U.

These panels with corrugation, hexagonal honeycomb and pyramidal truss cores are impacted at velocities between 50 m/s and 202 m/s while the relative density ranges from 0. 001 to 0. 15 The effects of core configuration and layer number on projectile impact resistance of <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> with cellular cores are studied.

This paper studies the bending performance of and deformation calculation methods for two-way web-reinforced composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> with different web spacing and heights. Polyurethane foam, two-way orthogonal glass-fiber woven cloth and unsaturated resin were used as raw materials in this study. Vacuum infusion molding was used to prepare an ordinary composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel</b> and 5 web-reinforced composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> with different spacing and web heights. The panels were subjected to two-way panel bending tests with simple support for all four edges.

40|$|Aluminium {{honeycomb}} <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> {{have potential}} applications as a protective mechanism {{that can be}} used to prevent failure of an important structure subjected to impact loading. Therefore it is important to fully understand the resistance of the <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> subjected to impact loading conditions. The main objective of this work was to study the resistance of <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> with different aluminium honeycomb cores, air <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> (no core between the two face sheets) and monolithic plates of equivalent mass subjected to impact from foam projectiles. The deformation and the elastic spring-back of the honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> and the monolithic plates have been compared and discussed. The resistance of the panels and plates has been quantified by their back-face deflection with respect to the projectile impulse. Five different types of aluminium honeycombs have been used as the core material. The front-face sheet and the back-face sheet of the honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> are made of aluminium plate with 1 mm thickness. Cylindrical ALPORAS aluminium foams with a relative density between 9 % and 11 % are employed as the metal foam projectiles. They are fired at several hundred metres per second towards the centre of the panels and plates using a gas gun. The deflection histories of the back-face have been measured using a laser displacement sensor. From the deflection histories, the maximum deflection and the final deflection of the back-face can be distinguished. Deformation modes and failure modes of the individual component have been observed and classified into several categories. Moreover, the deflections of the honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> have been compared with deflections from air <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels.</b> It is found that the honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> outperform both the air <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> and the monolithic plates within an impulse range of 2. 25 kNsm(- 2) similar to 4. 70 kNsm(- 2). Outside this operational range, the advantages associated with employing the honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> as a protective structure upon impact of foam projectiles diminishes.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a {{concrete}} <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel</b> originated in the United States in 1906 where a building was constructed with <b>sandwich</b> tilt-up wall <b>panels.</b> Since then <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> have developed gradually and have continued to improve. [...] There {{are two types of}} concrete sandwich wall panels: (1) Architectural wall panels (non-composite type), and (2) Load bearing wall panels (composite and non-composite type). [...] In general, the non-composite type of load bearing panel is used more commonly because there are less limitations compared with the composite types. This thesis deals with the structural design and analysis of the non-composite type of load bearing wall panel. [...] In the past, certain problems besetted architects, engineers, and contractors working with concrete <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels.</b> These problems are associated with: [...] (1) Bonding between concrete and insulation [...] (2) Joints in panel [...] (3) Panel connections [...] (4) Control of cracking. [...] This study has been undertaken with the aim of solving some of these problems. Three experiments were conducted accordingly to determine the behavior of concrete <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels.</b> The first experiment was to investigate the effects of heating and cooling on <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> and to compare the experimental results with theoretical calculations. The principal results of this experiment demonstrated the effects on concrete <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> under varying thermal conditions. These results should serve as a guideline for the design of joints in <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels.</b> The second and third experiments were initiated to investigate and compare the bending stresses, deflections and shear strength in concrete <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> either with or without shear connectors. The panels were subjected to a simulated uniformly distributed load under simply supported conditions. It can be concluded from the experimental results that a well designed anchor system joining the concrete <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel</b> faces through the core insulation is a fundamental requirement in the future production of <b>sandwich</b> wall <b>panels</b> in order to obtain full shear transfer between the faces. Without these shear connectors, a concrete structural <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel</b> will usually fail by shear of the bond between the core and faces or by shear failure of the core itself. [...] The deflection on a <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel</b> is the sum of ordinary bending deflection and an additional deflection associated with shear deformation of the core. Experimental results showed that deflections were mainly associated with shear deformation of the core for panels without shear connectors. [...] Deflections measured were less for panels containing shear connectors. For both panels, from theoretical calculations, {{it was found that the}} deflections were mainly associated with shear deformation, with less than 1 % due to bending. [...] A proper shear connector system transfers all lateral loads including wind forces from the exterior face to the interior structural face of the panel. Hence the sleeve anchor, torsion anchors and connector pins play a very important part in the performance of concrete <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels.</b> Prestressing techniques can also improve the design of such panels and have been widely used in recent developments of <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels.</b> [...] For this study, a typical non-composite type of concrete <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel</b> was selected as a design example. For the design of such concrete <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels,</b> the following factors were carefully considered: [...] (1) The thickness of both faces of the panel [...] (2) The loading conditions [...] (3) The fire resistance of the <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel</b> [...] (4) The temperature gradient between the faces, and [...] (5) The panel anchor system...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> {{comprise}} a thick, light-weight plastic foam such as polyurethane, polystyrene or mineral wool sandwiched between two relatively thin steel faces. One or both steel faces may be flat, lightly profiled or fully profiled. Until recently <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel</b> construction in Australia {{has been limited}} to cold-storage buildings {{due to the lack}} of design methods and data. However, in recent times, its use has increased significantly due to their widespread structural applications in building systems. Structural <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> generally used in Australia comprise of polystyrene foam core and thinner (0. 42 mm) and high strength (minimum yield stress of 550 MPa and reduced ductility) steel faces bonded together using separate adhesives. <b>Sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> exhibit various types of buckling behaviour depending on the types of faces used. Three types of buckling modes can be observed which are local buckling of plate elements of fully profiled faces, flexural wrinkling of flat and lightly profiled faces and mixed mode buckling of lightly profiled faces due to the interaction of local buckling and flexural wrinkling. To study the structural performance and develop appropriate design rules for <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels,</b> all these buckling failure modes have to be investigated thoroughly. A well established analytical solution exists for the design of flat faced <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels,</b> however, the design solutions for local buckling of fully profiled <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> and mixed mode buckling of lightly profiled <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> are not adequate. Therefore an extensive research program was undertaken to investigate the local buckling behaviour of fully profiled <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> and the mixed mode buckling behaviour of lightly profiled <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels.</b> The first phase of this research was based on a series of laboratory experiments and numerical analyses of 50 foam-supported steel plate elements to study the local buckling behaviour of fully profiled <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> made of thin steel faces and polystyrene foam core covering a wide range of b/t ratios. The current European design standard recommends the use of a modified effective width approach to include the local buckling effects in design. However, the experimental and numerical results revealed that this design method can predict reasonable strength for <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> with low b/t ratios (< 100), but it predicts unconservative strengths for panels with slender plates (high b/t ratios). The use of <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> with high b/t ratios is very common in practical design due to the increasing use of thinner and high strength steel plates. Therefore an improved design rule was developed based on the numerical results that can be used for fully profiled <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> with any practical b/t ratio up to 600. The new improved design rule was validated using six full-scale experiments of profiled <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> and hence can be used to develop safe and economical design solutions. The second phase of this research was based on a series of laboratory experiments and numerical analyses on lightly profiled <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> to study the mixed mode buckling behaviour due to the interaction of local buckling and flexural wrinkling. The current wrinkling formula, which is a simple modification of the methods utilized for flat panels, does not consider the possible interaction between these two buckling modes. As the rib depth and width of flat plates between the ribs increase, flat plate buckling can occur leading to the failure of the entire panel due to the interaction between local buckling and wrinkling modes. Experimental and numerical results from this research confirmed that the current wrinkling formula for lightly profiled <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> based on the elastic half-space method is inadequate in its present form. Hence an improved equation was developed based on validated finite element analysis results to take into account the interaction of the two buckling modes. This new interactive buckling formula can be used to determine the true value of interactive buckling stress for safe and economical design of lightly profiled <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels.</b> This thesis presents the details of experimental investigations and finite element analyses conducted to study the local buckling behaviour of fully profiled <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> and the mixed mode buckling behaviour of lightly profiled <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels.</b> It includes development and validation of suitable numerical and experimental models, and the results. Current design rules are reviewed and new improved design rules are developed based on the results from this research...|$|R
50|$|A <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel</b> is any {{structure}} made {{of three}} layers: a low-density core, {{and a thin}} skin-layer bonded to each side. <b>Sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> are used in applications where a combination of high structural rigidity and low weight is required.|$|R
