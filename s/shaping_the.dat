5|$|Benjamin Woolfield Mountfort (13 March 1825 – 15 March 1898) was an English {{emigrant}} to New Zealand, {{where he}} became one of that country's most prominent 19th-century architects.

Heavily influenced by the Anglo-Catholic philosophy behind early Victorian architecture, he is credited with importing the Gothic revival style to New Zealand.

5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role in <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E

Deady successfully advocated for provisions in the document to set six-year terms for judges, four-year terms for state officers, and biennial sessions for the legislature. He also led the southern party, which opposed state education in all forms. During the debates Deady also advocated for discrimination towards Chinese immigrants and Blacks, as well as in favor for slavery in Oregon.|$|E
