30|$|Although the UP-equivalent PMs output 2 R 1 T motion, their {{reachable}} workspaces {{are usually}} of concern {{since they are}} used for locating in most applications. However, {{it should be noted}} that their reachable workspaces are highly dependent on their rotational capabilities since the position variations of the moving platforms in two directions are generated by the two rotational motions of the mechanisms. The reachable workspaces of the Tricept and TriVariant robots are not large because their rotational capabilities are limited to some extent by <b>spherical</b> <b>joints,</b> particularly with the existence of multiple <b>spherical</b> <b>joints.</b> It is meaningful to expand the rotational capabilities of UP-equivalent PMs to ultimately achieve considerable reachable workspaces.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new concept, reachable volumes, which denotes the set of points that the end effector of a chain or linkage can reach. This generalizes work on reachable distances for planar robots to 3 -dimensional <b>spherical</b> <b>joints.</b> We show that the reachable volume of a chain {{is equivalent to the}} Minkowski sum of the reachable volumes of its links, which gives us an efficient method for computing reachable volumes. We present a method for generating configurations using reachable volumes for various types of robots including chain robots (with and without closure constraints), tree-like robots, and robots containing a combination of them. Unlike previous methods, ours works for 3 -dimensional linkages with <b>spherical</b> <b>joints</b> and is capable of generating samples for problems with constraints on internal joints as well as end effectors. We show that reachable volumes samples {{are less likely to be}} invalid due to self-collisions, making reachable volumes sampling more efficient for higher dimensional problems. We also show that these samples are easier to connect than others, resulting in more connected roadmaps. Finally we demonstrate that our method can be applied to 262 -dof, multi-loop, and tree-like linkages, problems where existing methods cannot be used (e. g., closed chains with <b>spherical</b> <b>joints)</b> or cannot b...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we attempt}} to invent new {{architectures}} of UP-equivalent PMs with high rotational capability and low geometrical condition requirements. That is, the new architectures of UP-equivalent PMs should contain no <b>spherical</b> <b>joints</b> and should avoid a common point of intersection of several revolute axes in space. Theoretically, type synthesis of PMs with two rotational DOFs is more difficult and complicated than that of PMs with either one or no rotation. Hence, although considerable {{progress has been made}} in terms of the general method for type synthesis of lower-mobility PMs [14 – 27], and some 3 T or 3 T 1 R PMs with specified kinematic properties have been proposed [28 – 32], few architectures of UP-equivalent PMs without <b>spherical</b> <b>joints</b> and strict assembly requirement have been disclosed.|$|R

This arrangement is as follows: From each bearing a chain is led, over a guide pulley situated {{at the top of}} the guide belonging to that bearing, to an arm fixed on a rocking-shaft placed close to the floor of the vessel. On this rocking-shaft there is also fixed another arm, and from this a chain proceeds aft to the piston rod of a horizontal steam cylinder, placed as shown in Fig. 2. This cylinder is provided with a slide valve, by which the steam can be admitted to or released from the forward end of the cylinder at pleasure; and, when the steam is so admitted, it drives back the piston, and, by means of the arrangement of chains and rocking-shaft already described, raised the guide tube, through which the main tube passes, and thus depresses that end of the latter which carries the torpedo. The extent to which the piston in the steam cylinder is driven back, and, consequently, the extent to which the guide tube is raised, is regulated by means of a screw which passes through the back cylinder cover, this screw, which is furnished with a handwheel and check-nut, forming a stop against which the piston rests when driven back by the steam.|$|E

40|$|Rigidity {{detection}} is {{an important}} tool for structural synthesis of mechanisms, as it helps to unveil possible sources of inconsistency in Grübler's count of degrees of freedom (DOFs) and thus to generate consistent kinematical models of complex mechanisms. One case that has puzzled researchers over many decades is the famous "double-banana" problem, which is a representative counter-example of Laman's rigidity condition formula for which existing standard DOF counting formulas fail. The {{reason for this is}} the body-by-body and joint-by-joint decomposition of the interconnection structure in classical algorithms, which does not unveil structural isotropy groups for example when whole substructures rotate about an "implied hinge" according to Streinu. In this paper, a completely new approach for rigidity detection for cases as the "double-banana" counterexample in which bars are connected by <b>spherical</b> <b>joints</b> is presented. The novelty of the approach consists in regarding the structure not as a set of joint-connected bodies but as a set of interconnected loops. By tracking isolated DOFs such as those arising between pairs of <b>spherical</b> <b>joints,</b> rigidity/mobility subspaces can be easily identified and thus the "double-banana" paradox can be resolved. Although the paper focuses on the solution of the double-banana mechanism as a special case of paradox bar-and-joint frameworks, the procedure is valid for general body-and-joint mechanisms, as is shown by the decomposition of <b>spherical</b> <b>joints</b> into a series of revolute joints and their rigid-link interconnections...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Joints in {{deployable}} structures can {{degrade the}} stiffness and {{the stability of}} spacecraft. In this study, the nonlinear stiffness of spherical joints is investigated. The traditional contact model of spherical joints based on non-conforming contact assumption is presented. A new contact model for spherical joints based on the Winkler model and geometric constraints is established to calculate the stiffness of spherical joints with small clearances. The finite element model (FEM) of spherical joints is built to evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} theoretical model. The effects of the clearance and the contact force of spherical joints on the deformation of joints are investigated. When compared with FEM results, the error of the new spherical model is smaller than that of the traditional contact model when the clearance of <b>spherical</b> <b>joint</b> is not excessively large.

However, the inverse kinematics (IK) problem is very difficult to solve directly using these angular parameters, on which complex non-linear loop closure constraints are imposed by required end effector configurations. In a recent paper, our newly developed anchored triangle parameters were presented and shown to be well suited for the study of IK problems in many broad classes of linkages. The focus of that paper was the parameterization of non-singular solutions; among many specific types of IK problems, only one, that of a spatial chain with <b>spherical</b> <b>joints</b> imposing 5 dimensional constraints, was developed in detail.

40|$|At {{present the}} effects of {{friction}} {{are not included in}} three-dimensional mechanism simulation packages because of the difficulty of determining a friction model for joints such as the <b>spherical</b> <b>joint</b> where the frictional resistance to motion depends not only upon the coefficient of friction and the magnitude of the loading on the joint but also on the pressure distribution within the joint resulting from that loading. Thus the basis of this thesis has been the development of a mathematical model of {{the effects of}} friction in a <b>spherical</b> <b>joint</b> which could then be incorporated into a mechanisms simulation program. The model developed has shown that the main factors determining the magnitudes and directions of the frictional effects produced in a <b>spherical</b> <b>joint,</b> apart from the coefficient of friction and the magnitude of the loading, are the extent of the contact area between the ball and the socket and the magnitude of the angle between the axis of rotation of the joint and the direction of the applied load. Experimental results were obtained using apparatus that enabled the frictional moment produced on the socket of a joint to be measured while allowing the angle between the axis of rotation of the ball and the direction of the applied load to be varied between measurements. These results, obtained for a range of values of the coefficient of friction, confirm that this angle is a significant factor in the model and that the model usefully determines the frictional effects produced in a <b>spherical</b> <b>joint...</b>|$|E
