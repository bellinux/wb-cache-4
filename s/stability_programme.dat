40|$|We analyse {{the newly}} updated <b>Stability</b> <b>Programmes</b> of the Euro area governments by {{applying}} the simple accounting identity by which the financial balances of the government, {{the private sector and}} the foreign sector always sum to zero. While the focus of the old Stability and Growth Pact was solely on the government balance, the current euro crisis has shown that this narrow focus was wrong and that macroeconomic stability within the monetary union requires reducing imbalances between all three sectors of individual member states. While the need for overcoming these imbalances is now increasingly recognised by economists and policymakers, we argue that the projections for achieving stability in the current <b>Stability</b> <b>Programmes</b> are very likely too optimistic. We show that, individually, the <b>Stability</b> <b>Programmes</b> rely on optimistic assumptions about GDP growth; collectively, they require an improvement of the Euro area's current account {{with the rest of the}} world, the continuation of significant current account imbalances within the Euro area, and a steep drop of private balances in some countries. Based on some simple counterfactual simulations, we conclude that a symmetric effort at rebalancing current accounts would most likely require a slowdown of fiscal consolidation (in the current account surplus countries) but would be required to successfully address the euro area's macroeconomic challenges and thereby not only allow for consolidation in the medium term but also lead to the desired stability...|$|R

40|$|The Europe 2020 {{strategy}} of the European Commission (EC) {{as well as the}} national reform and <b>stability</b> <b>programmes</b> attribute a central role to wage moderation policies. Real wage growth below productivity growth and policies to deregulate the labour market in order to achieve this are recommended to increase the international competitiveness of the EU. However, the track record of these policies in the last three decades has been poor growth performance along with a declining share of wages in national income and rising inequality. Our results of a new project for the Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS) show that the EC policy of wage moderation is counter-productive, and leads to a stagnation in growth, risk of deflation, and destabilizing growth models driven by debt or export surpluses {{in the absence of a}} healthy growth in wages...|$|R

40|$|Using the {{financial}} balances accounting identity, we analyze {{whether there is}} evidence in recent national accounting data and the projections of the <b>Stability</b> <b>Programmes</b> (SP), that the focus on fiscal deficits {{to the exclusion of}} other economic variables risks further deterioration of the euro area economy’s growth rate. We find that, in the past given the focus on shrinking public deficits, growth forecasts have almost always deteriorated from one SP to the next, while the macroeconomic situation is not markedly different {{from the beginning of the}} euro area crisis, 2010. We conclude that continued fiscal austerity and disregard of current account imbalances is likely to lead to further deteriorating data that fail to live up to current growth forecasts. This will lead in turn to further growth forecast downward revision in the next SP batch. A simple simulation of a deterioration in the external economic environment indicates that a symmetric rebalancing of the current account imbalances might be more feasible than the current, asymmetric rebalancing...|$|R

40|$|In this chapter, {{we argue}} that the {{projections}} for achieving stability in the current <b>Stability</b> <b>Programmes</b> (SPs) of Euro zone member countries are very likely too optimistic. 2 We aver that by ignoring the importance of external rebalancing and assuming an overly buoyant world economy, the SPs either forecast unrealistic growth rates or unrealistically successful fiscal consolidation. Towards this, we examine the interrelated- ness of public deficit reduction and external imbalances reduction. We derive our argument mainly from evaluating the SPs against the logic of simple accounting identities, which clarify the connections of financial balances and thereby of the two challenges. Thus we transcend the SPs’ narrow focus only on the government balance, and shed light instead on the SPs’ projections of the financial balances of all three sectors in the economy (foreign, private and public) {{and how they are}} intertwined with the overall macroeconomic development. Merely the final brief sketch of feasible alternative policy recommendations to address both challenges (sustainability of public deficits and current account positions) requires a greater sophistication of the economic argument and thus involves more judgment...|$|R
40|$|The general {{adoption}} of austerity policies throughout the EU {{and in particular}} in the eurozone is having very adverse effects {{on the level of}} employment, on job and employment security and on working conditions.

The present paper first gives {{a brief description of the}} new policy surveillance system in the eurozone. Then it is suggested that the macroeconomic policies adopted in the context of reinforced surveillance are incoherent. The implications of austerity policies for workers are discussed; young workers are clearly badly affected. Details are given of acute pressures on European social models in the economically weaker countries, taking Portugal, Greece and Ireland as examples.

40|$|Government {{agencies}} and other {{national and international}} institutions are asked to perform forecasts over the medium term. In particular, the EU Stability and Growth Pact contains the obligation to formulate <b>stability</b> <b>programmes</b> over four years, covering a general economic outlook {{as well as the}} projected development of public fi nances. However, the current practice of performing medium-term economic projections is unsatisfactory from a methodological point of view as the applied methodology has been developed for short-run forecasting and it is questionable whether these methods are useful for the medium term. In particular, currently medium-term projections are mostly based on the neoclassical Solow growth model with an aggregate production function with labour, capital, and exogenous technological progress. It might be argued, however, that for medium-run projections endogenous growth models might be better suited. In this paper we give an overview of currently used methods for medium-term macroeconomic projections. Then we analyse the performance of medium-term forecasts for Austria to illustrate {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the typical approach. In particular, the fi ve-year projections of real GDP growth, infl ation and the unemployment rate are investigated. Finally, we describe some approaches to improve medium-run projections.
