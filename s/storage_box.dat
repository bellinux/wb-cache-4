5|$|Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the protagonist Jill Valentine from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment and enemies. Aside from Jill, the player takes control of another character for a brief portion of the game. To advance through the game, the player has to explore a city while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating various types of enemies. The player can interact with the environment in several ways, such as opening doors, pushing objects or climbing obstacles. Scattered throughout the city are weapons, ammunition and other items, which can be collected and put in the player's inventory. Items can be examined, used, or combined with others. The inventory is limited to a certain number of slots, and the player must often move items from the inventory to a <b>storage</b> <b>box</b> located in special rooms to manage space.|$|E

Emma realizes her feelings for Graham and the two kiss just as Regina opens a <b>storage</b> <b>box</b> in the hidden room and clutches Graham's heart, crushing it to dust, showing that she remembers being the Evil Queen. Before he collapses and dies, Graham's last words to Emma are [...] "I remember! Thank you." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 2008 saw Land Rover's 60th anniversary, {{for which}} {{a new series of}} special edition Defenders were produced. Branded the [...] "SVX", three models were built. All were painted black with [...] "satin" [...] effect body {{graphics}} on the vehicles sides and bonnet carrying the [...] "60th" [...] logo used throughout 2008 at various special events and on anniversary merchandise. Bespoke five-spoke alloy wheels were used and a new silver-coloured front grille design was used. This also incorporated a new design of headlamp with the sidelight lamp being integral with the main headlamp unit, allowing the space previously used for the separate sidelight to be used to fit a pair of high-intensity driving lamps. Inside the SVX models gained Recaro bucket seats in the front row, alloy gearlever knobs and a Garmin GPS navigation system. The drivetrain was the standard 2.4-litre diesel and six-speed manual permanent four-wheel-drive transmission. The SVX edition was available as a 110 (only available outside the UK), a 90 and a brand-new design of 90 soft top- the first time a soft top model had been available through showrooms in the UK since 1992. SVX soft tops had only the two front seats- the rear load bay being used to accommodate the spare wheel and a lockable <b>storage</b> <b>box.</b> A new design of hood was used, sloping down towards the rear over a jointed folding frame, unlike the standard square-framed hood used on other soft top Land Rovers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{basis of}} [...] "Catherine of Aragon" [...] was {{originally}} {{a piece that}} Wakeman wrote for Fragile with a working title of [...] "Handle With Care". Its title came about as staff at Trident Studios recommended the tape's <b>storage</b> <b>box</b> be labelled something misleading to {{lower the risk of}} theft and the tapes being sold as bootlegs. The box that had the song's tape in had a label that read [...] "Handle with care for the Joe Loss Orchestra", which Wakeman took and adapted for the track's title. [...] "I thought, 'No one is going to nick that!', and they didn't". Recorded at Trident Studios in London, the track features Yes's guitarist Steve Howe and bassist Chris Squire with percussionist Ray Cooper. By the time production began on [...] "Catherine Howard", engineer Ken Scott was replaced by Paul Tregurtha. Strawbs member Chas Cronk, who plays the bass guitar on the track, recalled the [...] "total confusion" [...] during the recording and [...] "couldn't make head or tail of what [...] were doing. We were going through it part by part and I couldn't see how all the parts were going to match up." [...] He noted that Rick [...] "knew exactly {{what he was going to}} do although he had nothing written down. It was all stored in his head." [...] Wakeman describes [...] "Anne of Cleves" [...] as a [...] "rather free-form" [...] track, [...] "almost having no form at all, there was a contradiction in what everyone was playing. The guys in the band thought I was completely barking, but it had to be like that." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} a gentle handling of potatoes that maintains {{the quality of the}} product, potatoes are filled into <b>storage</b> <b>boxes</b> at the harvest stage. The filled <b>storage</b> <b>boxes</b> are transported to and deposited in the store. The potatoes are not exposed to any handling processes or mechanical stress. In order to fill the <b>storage</b> <b>boxes</b> on board the harvester, a filler has been developed and tested for three harvest periods. The method of filling the <b>storage</b> <b>boxes</b> on board the harvester was compared with two conventional procedures. The evaluation criteria used to compare the methods were amongst others: respiration intensity, black spots and the costs involved. As expected using the gentle filling process directly on the harvester the number and intensity of impacts can be reduced. Mainly potato varieties with high susceptibility showed lower respiration intensities and reduced grades of black spot development. The slightly higher process costs can be justified because of high quality of the tubers...|$|R

Valuable items for tea ceremony are usually stored {{in such a}} box, and in some cases, if the item has a long and distinguished history, several layers of boxes: an inner <b>storage</b> <b>box</b> (uchibako), middle <b>storage</b> <b>box</b> (nakabako), and outer <b>storage</b> <b>box</b> (sotobako). The storage boxes for tea implements are not tea equipment in themselves, but have a very important place {{in the practice of}} chanoyu for the inscriptions on them which serve to validate their history and other such important data.|$|E
