As they terrorised the Azores, the pressure increased from the authorities, who by then had taken special notice of Low, despite the hordes of pirates in operation at the time.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{there were}} no public art {{galleries}} in England with permanent collections. In 1816, {{in the face of}} his continued lack of success, Etty decided to spend a year in Italy to study the artworks held in the great Italian collections. He had made a brief visit to France in early 1815, but other than this had never been abroad. The 28-year-old Etty had fallen in love, and fretted about the difficulties a potential marriage would cause, and whether it would be right to travel to further his career even though it would mean taking his new wife to a foreign country. In the event, the woman rejected him, and he <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Continent in early September 1816.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{his arrival in}} California in March 1868, naturalist John Muir <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Yosemite area, where he found work tending to the sheep owned by a local rancher, Pat Delaney. Muir's employment provided him {{with the opportunity to}} study the area's plants, rocks, and animals; the articles and scientific papers he wrote describing his observations helped to popularize the area and to increase scientific interest in it. Muir {{was one of the first}} to suggest that Yosemite Valley's major landforms were created by large alpine glaciers, contradicting the view of established scientists such as Josiah Whitney, who regarded Muir as an amateur.|$|E

5|$|L'Empire des Mille Planètes (Empire of a Thousand Planets) premiered in Pilote in 1969 {{and marked}} a further {{development}} for the Valérian series and for Mézières art. This story was the series' first full-blown attempt at space opera and it <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time the two main signature elements of Valérian: the use of science fiction as a political allegory and Mézières' meticulously detailed depictions of alien worlds. The follow-up story World Without Stars saw the final evolution of Mézières' art into the style that became prevalent in the Valerian stories of the 1970s and 1980s, with the first realistic renderings of Valérian and Laureline, {{as opposed to the}} caricatures of the earlier stories.|$|E

Rather than attacking Medina itself, which was populated by numerous strongholds {{that would have}} required long sieges to overcome, they camped on the pastures north of the city, hoping that the Muslims would come out to meet them.

5|$|After {{the death}} of Muhammad, many {{powerful}} Arab tribes broke away in open revolt against the rule of Medina. Caliph Abu Bakr sent his armies to counter the rebels and apostates. Khalid was one of Abu Bakr’s main advisers and an architect of the strategic planning of the Riddah wars. He was given the command over the strongest Muslim army and was sent towards central Arabia, the most strategically sensitive area where the most powerful rebel tribes resided. The region was closest to the Muslim stronghold of Medina and was {{the greatest threat to}} the city. Khalid first <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rebel tribes of Tayy and Jalida, where Adi ibn Hatim—a prominent companion of Muhammad, and a chieftain of the Tayy tribe—arbitrated, and the tribes submitted to the Caliphate.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} September, Vikrant and her escorts reached Port Blair. En {{route to}} Visakhapatnam, {{tactical}} exercises were conducted {{in the presence of}} the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Eastern Naval Command. From Vishakhapatnam, Vikrant set out for Madras for maintenance. Rear Admiral S. H. Sharma was appointed Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet and arrived at Vishakhapatnam on 14 October. After receiving the reports that Pakistan might launch preemptive strikes, maintenance was stopped for another tactical exercise, which was completed during the night of 26–27 October at Vishakhapatnam. Vikrant then returned to Madras to resume maintenance. On 1 November, the Eastern Fleet was formally constituted, and on 13 November, all the ships <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Andaman and Nicobar Islands. To avoid misadventures, it was planned to sail Vikrant to a remote anchorage, isolating it from combat. Simultaneously, deception signals would give the impression that Vikrant was operating somewhere between Madras and Vishakhapatnam.|$|E

On the way, they stopped in Hamburg, where they met the mayor, who proudly showed them a wonder of nature which he possessed: the taxidermied remains of a seven-headed hydra. Linnaeus quickly discovered it was a fake: jaws and clawed feet from weasels and skins from snakes had been glued together. The provenance of the hydra suggested to Linnaeus it had been manufactured by monks to represent the Beast of Revelation. As much as this may have upset the mayor, Linnaeus made his observations public and the mayor's dreams of selling the hydra for an enormous sum were ruined. Fearing his wrath, Linnaeus and Sohlberg had to leave Hamburg quickly.|$|E

Maulay died later in 1241, {{probably}} while still in the Holy Land. His wife died before him and his heir was his son Peter de Maulay. Besides his heir, Maulay had two other sons– Robert and Stephen, and a daughter, Hilary, who married Piers de Brus, son and heir of Piers de Brus, the Lord of Skelton. Maulay had endowed a chantry at Meaux Abbey in Yorkshire in memory of his wife. He also confirmed grants of lands to Eskdale Priory, a Grandmontine house founded by Isabella's father, and to Nostell Priory. Maulay was also a benefactor of the Knights of Saint Thomas, a military religious order for Englishmen.|$|E
5|$|Meeker {{was born}} in Butler County, Ohio, to Jacob and Phoebe Meeker. His family {{relocated}} to Indiana {{when he was a}} boy. He married Eliza Jane Sumner in 1851; the following year the couple, with Ezra's brother and with their newborn son, <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Oregon Territory, where land could be claimed and settled on. Although they endured hardships on the Trail in the journey of nearly six months, the entire party survived the trek. Meeker and his family briefly stayed near Portland, then journeyed north to live in the Puget Sound region. They settled at what is now Puyallup in 1862, where Meeker grew hops for use in brewing beer. By 1887, his business had made him wealthy, and his wife built a large mansion for the family. In 1891 an infestation of hop aphids destroyed his crops and took much of his fortune. He later tried his hand at a number of ventures, and made four largely unsuccessful trips to the Klondike, taking groceries and hoping to profit from the gold rush.|$|E
5|$|As Scott's men {{reached an}} open prairie near the Wea {{settlement}} of Ouiatenon on June 1, they were discovered by an enemy scout {{and hurried to}} attack the villages before the residents could react. When the main force reached the villages, they found the residents hurriedly fleeing across the Wabash River in canoes. Aided by cover fire from a Kickapoo village {{on the other side}} of the river, they were able to escape before Scott's men could attack. The river was too wide to ford at Scott's location, so he sent a detachment under James Wilkinson in one direction and a detachment under Thomas Barbee in the other to find a place to ford the river. Wilkinson did not find a suitable location, but located and killed a small band of Indians before returning. Barbee located a crossing and conducted a brief raid against the Indians on the other side before returning to Scott. The next morning, Scott's main force burned the nearby villages and crops, while a detachment under Wilkinson <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> settlement of Kethtippecannunk. The inhabitants of this village had fled across Eel Creek, and after a brief and ineffective firefight, Wilkinson's men burned the city and returned to Scott. In his official report, Scott noted that many of Kethtippecannunk's residents were French and speculated that it was connected to, perhaps dependent upon, the French settlement of Detroit.|$|E

5|$|Harith {{now turned}} {{his sights on}} Marw and <b>set</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> capital, where also he had sympathizers. However, Asim managed to cement the loyalty of the {{wavering}} Khurasanis by threatening to abandon the city for Naysabur on the western fringes of Khurasan. There he would rely on the Qaysi tribesmen whose loyalty to the Umayyad regime was known, and ask for reinforcements from Syria. Coupled {{with the presence of}} the numerous natives in Harith's army, which lent it the appearance of a foreign army, the local Arab elites chose to rally behind Asim. As it neared Marw, Harith's army had swelled to some 60,000 men as the mawali flocked to his banner, according to the report of al-Tabari. Asim's force was considerably smaller, and less eager: he had to pay them extra money in order to induce them to fight. Nevertheless, he marched out of Marw and took up positions behind a canal at Zarq, destroying its bridges. As Harith's army approached and repaired the bridges, more than 2,000 Arabs from his ranks deserted to Asim, evidently mistrusting the intentions of the native troops of Harith's army. In the subsequent battle, Asim gained a major victory, as many of Harith's troops drowned in the canal. As a result of this failure, most of the mawali and native princes abandoned Harith, whose army was reduced to a loyal core of some 3,000 men. This forced Harith to accept a peace offer from Asim—who likewise could not count on the continued support of the Khurasani Arabs now that the danger from the natives had passed—and retired to Andkhuy. However, in the next year Harith renewed his revolt and marched again on Marw. Asim could not persuade the Khurasanis to fight for him, and was left with only some 1,000 Syrians and Jazirans from his personal guard. Harith's forces were not much larger either, being reduced to the garrison of Marw al-Rudh. In the ensuing battle at the village of al-Dandanqan near Marw, Asim again emerged victorious, forcing Harith to flee to Marw al-Rudh.|$|E
