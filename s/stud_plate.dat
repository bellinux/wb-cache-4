These systems are often related to lightweight constructions, and developed {{to be used in}} load-bearing structures and dwellings. One of the main drawbacks of this type of building systems is often the sound insulation.

The flanking transmission is often the limiting aspect for the total sound insulation of such a structure. A prediction model for flanking transmission of lightweight building structures is thus under development.

Above the foundation and sill plate the connections are typically made using steel strap or sheet stampings, nailed to wood members using special hardened high-shear strength nails, and heavy angle stampings secured with through bolts, using large washers to prevent pull-through. Where inadequate bolts are provided between the sill plates and a foundation in existing construction (or are not trusted due to possible corrosion), special clamp plates may be added, {{each of which is}} secured to the foundation using expansion bolts inserted into holes drilled in an exposed face of concrete. Other members must then be secured to the sill plates with additional fittings.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new shearwall system {{referred to as}} “midply wall”. The new wall system uses the same wall sheathing and dimension lumber as standard shearwalls used in platform-frame construction in North America. In this wall, however, the sheathing {{is placed in the}} centre of the wall between a series of pairs of <b>studs</b> and <b>plates</b> placed {{on both sides of the}} wall sheathing. As a result, nails connecting the framing members to the sheathing work in double shear in contrast to single shear in standard shearwalls. This results in substantial improvements in the overall performance of midply walls. Test results for midply walls under monotonic, cyclic and dynamic loading conditions are presented and compared with those for standard shearwalls under similar loading conditions. Implementation of the midply wall in wood design codes in North America is proposed and issues related to the code implementation are discussed. ...|$|R

The technique is variously referred to colloquially in the building trades as stick and frame, stick and platform, or stick and box as the sticks (studs) give the structure its vertical support, and the box-shaped floor sections with joists contained within length-long post and lintels (more commonly called headers), support the weight of whatever is above, including the next wall up and the roof above the top story.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The force, temperature, {{and time}} {{relationships}} were investigated by using oscilloscope measurement techniques. Force {{was measured using}} a strain gage and the dynamic response recorded with a polaroid oscilloscope camera. Temperature was measured with a tungsten-rhenium thermocouple and recorded in the same manner. Residual stress measurements were made to determine an approximate temperature gradient of the weld zone. Tensile strength was used for determining {{the quality of the}} weld. All relationships were displayed using tensile strength as the dependent variable. An exponentially-shaped drop shaft was designed to control the force characteristics. No force wave-reflections were observed. The design criteria were high damping, smooth transitions, and coupling to the air. Process variables were reduced to allow observation of the force, time, and temperature relationships. The magnetic field, due to the current carrying leads, was a major factor in causing unsymmetrical arc formation and was reduced by shielding. Resistance of the circuit was controlled by providing bolted connections and using stainless steel strips for the varlable resistance element. The voltage and capacitance parameters were maintained at one setting in order to eliminate their effect. Oxide Iayers were not controlled but the <b>studs</b> and <b>plates</b> were cleaned of grease and films. Metallurgical relationships are discussed but not displayed.

Previous results have demonstrated the useful application of this design in coupling beams of medium span-to-depth ratios (l/h) under both inelastic seismic and elastic wind loading. This paper presents further experimental studies on five PRC coupling beams, which investigated the importance of shear connectors on plate/reinforced concrete composite action. Three medium-length (l/h= 2. 5) and two short (l/h= 1. 17) PRC coupling beams, each containing a vertically embedded steel plate, were tested under reversed cyclic loading. While one short beam was welded with expanded metal meshes on the plate surfaces, others were welded with shear <b>studs</b> on the <b>plates</b> in the wall regions and/or the beam spans. Results showed that the expanded metal meshes did not work effectively, and while the shear studs in the beam span only slightly increased the beam capacity, those in the wall regions contributed considerably in improving inelastic beam performance. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Water {{infiltration}} in wood frame walls {{leads to}} different water transport phenomena: water runoff and spreading {{of water on}} the sheathing, water infiltration into the insulation, water flow on the bottom plate and into the bottom plate-sheathing joint, water uptake by sheathing, <b>stud</b> and bottom <b>plate,</b> and leakage of water from the joint sheathing-bottom plate. A laboratory test was designed to quantify the different transport flows. For the water infiltration rates and duration tested, water infiltration into the insulation and leakage are found likely to occur. Water uptake and spreading {{of water on the}} sheathing can lower these flows. OSB and fibreboard show no spreading. The spreading of plywood depends on the surface characteristics and fiber direction. Leakage will more likely occur at high infiltration rates. The amounts of water flowing on the bottom plate and taken up by the bottom plate are more limited. Water infiltrating at the stud and flowing down the stud into the stud-bottom plate joint, will be substantially taken up by the stud in longitudinal direction...|$|R

40|$|A finite size plate {{excited by}} {{airborne}} sound has both forced and freely propagating bending waves. The forced waves are {{generated by the}} airborne sound excitation and the freely propagating waves are generated when the forced waves are reflected at a discontinuity such as {{the edges of the}} <b>plate,</b> <b>studs</b> or stringers. Unless the plate is very heavily damped, the transverse vibration of the plate is dominated by the freely propagating waves. However below the critical frequency of the plate, the direct airborne sound transmission of the plate is dominated by the forced waves because their radiation efficiency is very much greater than that of the freely propagating waves. The prediction of airborne flanking sound transmission requires the prediction of the transmission of the bending waves at the junction of plates. This paper shows that this transmission is different for forced and freely propagating bending waves below the critical frequency of the plate from which the bending waves are incident upon the junction. It is shown that {{it is not possible to}} separately calculate the intensity of a forced incidence wave and its freely propagating reflected wave because the cross terms do not vanish when the incident wave is forced...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The authors {{report on}} an {{experimental}} test program on different shear connectors {{to be used}} in floor elements where prefabricated concrete beams are to be connected on top of cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels. The objective is to evaluate the level of composite action that can be achieved and the increase of strength and stiffness when combining effectively these structural components in a floor element. Shear tests were performed on 12 specimens in total. The shear connector consists of a steel plate as the common part to connect to both the concrete beam and the CLT panel. To the steel <b>plate,</b> <b>studs</b> or a metal mesh were welded and casted in the concrete beam to form a prefabricated unit. The CLT panel was then attached to the steel plate by screws. The main slip occurred between the CLT panel and the steel plate. The test results show a high ultimate load capacity for all types of shear connectors and a ductile type of behaviour for most of them. The test results for the shear connectors were compared with the capacity obtained from analytical models. Also, the strength and stiffness of partially composite floor elements with these shear connectors were analysed. It was found that from a structural point of view these shear connections are suitable to be used to form floor elements {{with a high level of}} composite action...|$|R

It is commonly used as floor joists and bearers with web openings in residential, industrial and commercial buildings. Their shear strengths are considerably reduced when web openings are included {{for the purpose of}} locating building services. A cost effective method of eliminating the detrimental effects of a large web opening is to attach suitable stiffeners around the web openings of LSBs. Experimental and numerical studies were undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour and strength of LSBs with circular web openings reinforced using <b>plate,</b> <b>stud,</b> transverse and sleeve stiffeners with varying sizes and thicknesses. Both welding and varying screw-fastening arrangements were used to attach these stiffeners to the web of LSBs. Finite element models of LSBs with stiffened web openings in shear were developed to simulate their shear behaviour and strength of LSBs. They were then validated by comparing the results with experimental test results and used in a detailed parametric study. These studies have shown that plate stiffeners were the most suitable, however, their use based on the current American standards was found to be inadequate. Suitable screw-fastened plate stiffener arrangements with optimum thicknesses have been proposed for LSBs with web openings to restore their original shear capacity.

The published article is copyrighted by the American Society of Civil Engineers {{and can be found}} at: [URL] paper presents the results of a test program whose goal was to better understand the contribution of individual elements to the performance of typical light-frame wood structures during tsunami loading. The intent was to be able to replicate failures in a structural engineering laboratory that were observed during laboratory experiments of hydraulic loading on wood walls at the NEES Tsunami Facility at Oregon State University. The elastic and inelastic response of shear walls, out-of-plane walls, and a full light-frame wood structural system subjected to varying lateral loads were observed using Digital Image Correlation (DIC). DIC provided a non-contact, three-dimensional measurement system that returned displacement results measured at multiple areas of interest on the wall surface. Overall, these experiments show that the elastic stiffness and ultimate capacity of the shear wall is significantly higher at full height compared to intermediate heights on the wall, and the ultimate lateral capacity was higher in comparison to the a full structural system. The results indicate that the out-of-plane wall behaves like a one way slab with limited contribution from adjacent studs in carrying load. The <b>stud</b> to bottom <b>plate</b> connection failures observed during the wave tank tests were successfully reproduced, and indicate that the nailed connection needs to be reinforced to utilize the available capacity of the individual framing members...|$|R
