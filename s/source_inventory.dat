DATA SOURCES Illinois maintains a criteria pollutant emission inventory known as ISSIS (Illinois Stationary <b>Source</b> <b>Inventory</b> System). The stationary <b>source</b> <b>inventory</b> includes points sources which require a permit. In Illinois, permitting exemptions are based upon physical characteristics of a device (e. g., boilers with less than one million BTU per hour heat input) or throughput (e. g., less than 5, 000 gallons of coating/solvent use per year). There are no exemptions for permitting for de minimis emission rates so the point <b>source</b> <b>inventory</b> has a large number of sources as compared to other states...|$|E
40|$|Emission {{inventories}} are {{a critical}} component for air quality management. An accurate and up-to-date inventory data is {{an essential element of}} air quality modeling that is crucial in determining compliance with ambient standards and in making policy decisions. To insure that accurate inventory data are obtained in a State or local agency, a combined Title V permitting process and point <b>source</b> <b>inventory</b> reporting infrastructure are being implemented using Microsoft’s Access database program. This application is to develop the consolidated system for the State of Tennessee point <b>source</b> <b>inventory,</b> the Consolidated Emission Reporting Rule (CERR) request information system and Tennessee Title V permitting system together and manages permitting records and reporting inventory. The Access interface provides a method for major source companies to complete their Title V permit applications electronically and, at the same time, generate their point <b>source</b> <b>inventory</b> required by CERR. For validation purposes, the inventory data obtained from the electronic Title V permit application via the Access interface are checked against the National Emission Inventory Input Format (NIF 3. 0) quality assurance algorithm. With this method of collecting and verifying data, regulatory agencies can update emission inventories with va lid data to meet the requirements of the Consolidated Emissions Reporting Rule with minimal effort and the needs for air quality modeling...|$|E

40|$|The {{solution}} of the continuity equation in practical applications is examined, and the values needed for approximate solutions are indicated. Models are adequate for investigating what could happen, but are less satisfactory for predicting what will happen. An example is given {{in relation to the}} distribution of SO 2 over Connecticut. More knowledge is needed about atmospheric chemistry before better predictions can be expected. The effect of particulates on atmospheric opacity is reviewed. If we modify or control an emission, how are we sure, even in the simplest case of a stable pollutant, that we know the resulting effects on air quality? Further, how do these changes of air quality react on the weather and climate? We consider here the suitability of models to provide data for criteria and standards and, by implication, as tools in the planning of control measures. Air quality models solve the continuity equation of the concentration of a pollutant by integrating from given initial conditions subject to certain boundary conditions and a specification at some level of detail of the meteorological situation. (Some models assume a form of solution and insert numerical values of certain parameters determined by the meteorological and initial and boundary conditions.) The boundary conditions must include the <b>source</b> <b>inventory.</b> Inventory errors inevitably lead to errors in air quality computation, but we are concerned at the moment with the meteorology and will assume that we have a perfect <b>source</b> <b>inventory.</b> We may write the continuity equation as: Local rate of change of concentration Transport (divergence of flux) + Chemistry (local conversion rate...|$|E

40|$|Dual <b>sourcing</b> and <b>inventory</b> are two {{prevalent}} {{and widely}} studied strategies firms use to manage yield risk. A pervasive but implicit assumption {{in the literature}} is that a firm knows its suppliers' yield distributions with certainty. This is a strong assumption in many circumstances. A firm {{is more likely to}} have a forecast of a supplier's yield distribution and to update that forecast based on its experiences with the supplier. We introduce and analyze a Bayesian model of "supply learning" (i. e., distribution updating) and investigate how supply learning influences both <b>sourcing</b> and <b>inventory</b> strategies in dual-sourcing and single-sourcing models, respectively. In the case of Bernoulli all-or-nothing yield distributions, we completely characterize the firm's optimal <b>sourcing</b> and <b>inventory</b> decisions for the supply-learning model. Among other results, we prove that for a given expected supplier reliability (i. e., the mean of the firm's forecast for the probability of successful delivery) an increase in the reliability forecast uncertainty increases the attractiveness of a supplier, but it reduces the firm's desire to invest in inventory to protect against future supply failures. We extend our analysis to allow for general yield distributions, multiple sourcing (i. e., more than two suppliers), and inventory carryover in the dual-sourcing model. supply uncertainty, dual <b>sourcing,</b> <b>inventory...</b>|$|R

40|$|We examine {{here the}} {{hypothesis}} that during flowering, the grass pollen concentrations at a specific site reflect the distribution of grass pollen sources within a few kilometres from this site. We perform this analysis on data from a measurement campaign {{in the city of}} Aarhus (Denmark) using three pollen traps and by comparing these observations with a novel inventory of grass pollen sources. The <b>source</b> <b>inventory</b> is based on a new methodology developed for urban scale grass pollen sources. The new methodology is believed to be generally applicable for the European area, as it relies on commonly available remote sensing data combined with management information for local grass areas. The inventory has identified a number of grass pollen source areas present within the city domain. The comparison of the measured pollen concentrations with the inventory shows that the atmospheric concentrations of grass pollen in the urban zone reflects the source areas identified in the inventory, and that these pollen sources that are found to affect the pollen levels are located near and within the city domain. The results also show that during days with peak levels of pollen concentrations, there is no correlation between the three urban traps and an operational trap located just 60 km away. This finding suggests that during intense flowering, the grass pollen concentration mirrors the local source distribution, and is thus a local scale phenomenon. Model simulations aiming at assessment of population exposure to pollen levels are therefore recommended to take into account both local sources and local atmospheric transport, and not rely only on describing regional to long-range transport of pollen. The derived pollen <b>source</b> <b>inventory</b> can be entered into local scale atmospheric transport models in combination with other components that simulates pollen release in order to calculate urban scale variations in the grass pollen load. The gridded inventory with a resolution of 14 m is therefore made available as supplementary material to this paper, and the verifying grass pollen observations are in additional available in tabular form...|$|E
