40|$|AbstractThe ethnobotanical uses of wild olive, O. europaea subsp. africana (sometimes {{referred}} to as subsp. cuspidata) in southern Africa and {{in other parts of}} Africa are reviewed. Chromatographic analyses of secoiridoids (oleuropein and other oleuropeosides) in 25 wild <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> samples from 10 localities in South Africa showed substantial amounts of oleuropein (up to 110 mg/g dry weight) and not trace amounts as reported in the literature. Oleuropein is the main active compound in <b>olive</b> <b>leaf,</b> with demonstrated anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, hypolipidemic and hypotensive activities. A comparison with nine cultivated <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> samples (subsp. europaea) from six cultivars and two localities showed that commercial <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> can be distinguished by the presence of verbascoside, which is absent in wild olive. Extraction methods and solvent systems (TLC and HPLC) were compared, using pure oleuropein (isolated from wild <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> and identified by NMR) as an authentic reference sample. The unique peltate scales on the leaves are useful to identify <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> raw material (but are the same in both subspecies). The main conclusion is that wild <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> is chemically closely similar to cultivated <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> and therefore suitable as an alternative source of raw material for <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the alien {{horse-chestnut}} <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> Cameraria ohridella, on native fauna was studied by comparing the species richness of native <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> communities and the abundance of selected native <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> species in the presence and absence of horse-chestnut trees infested by C. ohridella, in various environments in Europe. The species richness of native <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> communities in Switzerland was lower at sites where C. ohridella was present than at control sites. In Switzerland, France and Bulgaria, several native <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> species were significantly less abundant {{in the vicinity of}} infested horse-chestnuts. The native species most affected by the presence of the invasive alien species were those occurring early in the year and sharing their parasitoid complex with C. ohridella. These results suggest apparent competition mediated by shared natural enemies because these are the only link between C. ohridella and native <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> using other food resources...|$|R

40|$|The <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> (Coelaenomenodera elaeidis Mlk) is {{the major}} pest of the oil palm. The {{seasonality}} of C. elaeidis, its natural enemies and their relationship with temperature, rainfall and relative humidity was observed between January 2009 and December 2010 at the main station of the Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm Research, Nigeria. Past <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> population estimates were obtained from NIFOR entomology division from 1976 - 1980. This study analyses temporal patterns in <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> abundance, and elucidates general patterns and factors influencing <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> abundance. Multiple linear regressions were {{used to analyze the}} relationship between abundance of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> its parasitoids and predators and the following climatic variables: maximum and minimum temperature (oC), rainfall (mm) and relative humidity (%). For the analyses, climate variables from the month of collection (control variable) or from the month before the collection (delayed variable) were used. The abundance of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> and predatory ants peaked in the dry season, while parasitoids were most abundant in the rainy season. Significant correlations (P is not great than 0. 05) were found between <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> its natural enemies and both control and delayed weather variables. For all years, maximum temperature was the most dominant variable for all the <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> stages. Significant correlations were found between <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> its natural enemies and both control and delayed weather variables. This indicates that the weather variables at both the month of collection and with a delayed month in relation to collection is critical for pest-weather evaluation. This is important for <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> control. Temperature, rainfall and relative humidity had an effect on the population of C. elaeidis, and this effect was manifested primarily in seasonal fluctuations in oil palm agroecosystems. Dry season months with resultant higher temperatures recorded higher population of C. elaeidis...|$|R

40|$|Shaded coffee agroecosystems {{traditionally}} have few pest problems potentially due to higher abundance {{and diversity of}} predators of herbivores. However, with coffee intensification (e. g., shade tree removal or pruning), some pest problems increase. For example, coffee <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> outbreaks {{have been linked to}} more intensive management and increased use of agrochemicals. Parasitic wasps control the coffee <b>leaf</b> <b>miner,</b> but few studies have examined the role of predators, such as ants, that are abundant and diverse in coffee plantations. Here, we examine linkages between arboreal ant communities and coffee <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> incidence in a coffee plantation in Mexico. We examined relationships between incidence and severity of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> attack and: (1) variation in canopy cover, tree density, tree diversity, and relative abundance of Inga spp. shade trees; (2) presence of Azteca instabilis, an arboreal canopy dominant ant; and (3) the number of arboreal twig-nesting ant species and nests in coffee plants. Differences in vegetation characteristics in study plots did not correlate with <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> damage perhaps because environmental factors act on pest populations at a larger spatial scale. Further, presence of A. instabilis did not influence presence or severity of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> damage. The proportion of leaves with <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> damage was significantly lower where abundance of twig-nesting ants was higher but not where twig-nesting ant richness was higher. These results indicate that abundance of twig-nesting ants in shaded coffee plantations may contribute to maintenance of low <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> populations and that ants provide important ecosystem services in coffee agroecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Background Epidemiological {{studies have}} shown a reduced {{incidence}} of cardiovascular disease in the Mediterranean population attributed to the consumption of dietary olive oil rich in antioxidants. This has lead to increased interest in the antioxidant properties of other phenolic compounds of olive tree products. It {{has been suggested that}} <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract may also have health benefits due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Antioxidants can prevent the effects of oxidative metabolism by scavenging free radicals and decreasing the hyperactivity of platelets associated with the development of occlusive thrombosis. No studies to date have investigated the effects of <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract on platelet function to our knowledge. Improved understanding of the antioxidant properties of <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract and its effect on platelet function could lead to improved cardiovascular health. Objective The current study used an <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract prepared from the Olea europaea L. tree. The aim was to determine if polyphenols in <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract would reduce platelet activity and, to establish an optimal dose in vitro that would reduce platelet aggregation and ATP release. Design Eleven subjects with normal platelet counts (150 – 400 x 109 /L) were recruited for the current in vitro study. <b>Olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract was added to citrated whole blood to obtain five concentrations ranging from 5. 4 ug/mL to 54. 0 ug/mL for a dose response curve. Baseline samples, without <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract were used as a negative control for each subject. After 2 hours incubation with <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract samples were analyzed for platelet aggregation and ATP release from platelets stimulated by the addition of collagen. Results Whole blood analysis (n= 11) showed a clear dose-dependant reduction in platelet aggregation with the increasing <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract concentrations (p< 0. 0001). There was also a similar decrease in ATP release from collagen stimulated platelets (p= 0. 02). Conclusion In the current study the <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract obtained from Olea europaea L. inhibited platelet aggregation and ATP release from collagen stimulated platelets in vitro. This study suggests <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract may prevent occlusive thrombosis by reducing platelet hyperactivity...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{enemies of}} the {{groundnut}} leaf miner,Aproaerema modicella (Deventer), were studied at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) located near Hyderabad in peninsular India. Hymenopterous parasitoids attacking <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> larvae {{were the most important}} group of natural enemies. Nine primary and eight secondary parasitoids emerged from host larvae, and killed up to 50 % of the <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> larvae sampled. The trophic relationships between primary and secondary parasitoids are incompletely understood. The influence of pathogens of this species is reported for the first time. These pathogens killed up to 30 % of the <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> larvae. The combined effects of all mortality agents killed up to 95 % of the <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> larvae per sample period.

40|$|Leaf mining {{is a form}} of endophagous {{herbivory}} {{in which}} insect larvae live and feed within leaf tissue. In this review we discuss aspects of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> ecology, and the current evidence for three hypotheses relating to the evolution of this feeding guild. We also present a summary of the literature coverage relating to these herbivores, which have been relatively poorly studied compared with insects that feed externally such as sap suckers and leaf chewers. The majority of published studies concern <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> from the northern hemisphere, with a general focus on those species considered to be agricultural, forestry or horticultural pests. In a more detailed case study, we examine aspects of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> ecology of Australian species. At least 114 species have been recorded as <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> in Australia in four orders: Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera. Lepidoptera and Diptera are the most speciose orders of Australian leaf miners; Hymenoptera are represented by a single endemic genus and half of all coleopteran miners are species introduced for biological control. Both the known number of leaf-mining species in Australia and the known number of hosts have increased in recent years following new targeted surveys. <b>Leaf</b> <b>miners</b> in Australia occur in many habitats and feed {{on a wide variety of}} host plants in at least 60 families although most individual species are monophagous. Although much of the research on <b>leaf</b> <b>miners</b> in Australia has focused on species that are commercially important pests or biological control agents, studies on fundamental aspects of <b>leaf</b> <b>miner</b> ecology are increasing.
