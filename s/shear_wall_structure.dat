Some theoretical and experimental investigations have been conducted to study the behaviour of isolated connecting beams and slit shear wall models under static load, but little work has been carried out to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the structural system. In this paper, the non-linear seismic response of slit shear walls under earthquake excitation is analyzed. Based on a simplified structural model, which is shown to have sufficient accuracy for slit shear wall structures, the influence of the elasto-plastic behaviour of the connecting beams on the dynamic response of the slit <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> <b>structure</b> is evaluated.

However with increase in population and due to the limited space availability the latest trend is to spread buildings vertically than laterally. Nowadays, there is a much greater demand for taller buildings relative to the past. // After concrete was introduced to construction world, it gained many improvements within a short time period and because of that concrete buildings spread all over the world. Due to the higher strength ranges that can be achieved by good quality concrete, the section dimensions of members in concrete buildings have reduced drastically in the recent past. The increase in height accompanied with the reduced member sizes formed slender buildings, which require more attention focused on the lateral stability of the building.

40|$|In {{the design}} of tall buildings, the most {{challenging}} task for structural engineers is to devise an efficient structural system to resist the action of lateral loads. Lateral stiffness design requires a proper selection of an effective structural form and appropriate sizing of all structural elements. Often times in the preliminary design stage of a tall building, several structural alternatives are proposed and the final structural system is generally sought by a time-consuming trial-and-error process. A computer-based method for the preliminary analysis and optimal top drift design of tall building structures is presented in this study. For the purpose of preliminary design, buildings with various structural forms are modelled approximately as two-dimensional shear-flexural beams and analysed by the continuum medium method. In this study, four structural forms including rigid frame <b>structures,</b> <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> <b>structures,</b> coupled <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> <b>structures,</b> and outrigger-braced structures are considered. A rigorously derived Optimality Criteria (OC) technique is developed for the top drift design of tall building structures. Only top deflection is considered {{because it is the}} most important starting point for the lateral stiffness design of tall building structures. Using the approximate analytical analysis and the OC design approach, a new computer-based method is developed so that the analysis and the design optimisation of structures can be simultaneously achieved, thus producing a very efficient and powerful design tool to guide design decision at the early design stage. Apart from helping engineers to select proper structural forms, this design tool can be utilized to estimate structural member sizes once a structural form is defined.

The seismic performance of RC <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> <b>structures</b> have been widely investigated by many researchers (Wallace 2012; Kim 2016). The <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> are also effective in preventing spread of fire (Kang et al. 2016). However the buildings with <b>shear</b> partition <b>walls</b> are not preferred these days mainly because the plan layouts fixed by the <b>shear</b> <b>walls</b> fail {{to meet the demand}} of people who prefer spatial variability. A staggered <b>wall</b> <b>structure</b> has story-high <b>walls</b> placed at alternate levels, which makes the system easier to remodel and consequently more sustainable while the economy and constructability of <b>shear</b> <b>wall</b> <b>structures</b> still maintained. Fintel (1968) proposed a staggered system for RC buildings in which staggered walls with attached slabs resist the gravity as well as the lateral loads as H-shaped story-high deep beams, and observed that the staggered wall systems would be more economical. Mee et al. (1975) investigated the structural performance of staggered wall systems by carrying out shaking table tests of 1 / 15 scaled models. Lee and Kim (2013) investigated the seismic performance of staggered <b>wall</b> <b>structures</b> with middle corridor; Kim and Baek (2013) conducted seismic risk assessment of staggered wall system structures; and Kim and Lee (2014) proposed a formula for fundamental natural period of staggered <b>wall</b> <b>structures.</b> Recently seismic behavior factors of the system were investigated based on the procedure recommended in the FEMA P 695 (2009) (Lee and Kim 2013, 2015), and ATC 19 (1995) (Kim et al. 2016). The seismic performance of a similar structure system in steel, the staggered truss system, has already been investigated (Kim et al. 2015; Kim and Kim 2017), and the system has been applied in many real building projects.|$|R
