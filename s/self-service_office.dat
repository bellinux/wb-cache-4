Center Directors endorse the paper as a necessary first step but note {{the lack of a}} discussion on resource allocation and an explicit definition of the CGIAR strategy and provide detailed comments for TAC’s consideration. The minutes also contain discussions related to reports on public awareness and the establishment of a public awareness position in the CG Secretariat, a paper prepared by Eugene Terry on Improving the Quality of Communications Between Donors and Centres and reports from the various subcommittees. In the Benefits Committee report the establishment of a <b>self-service</b> <b>office</b> is proposed. Center Directors also discuss a paper by TAC on External Reviews and make a number of detailed comments on the process including the time consumed, their high cost, the additional reviews commissioned by donors and the need to gain donor acceptance of External Reviews as adequately fulfilling their own requirements. They comment also on the TAC paper on relationships with NARS and note that it does not reflect center innovations and would benefit from the input of centers...|$|E

50|$|The Colbost Croft Museum, {{also known}} as the Folk Museum, is a simple open-air exhibit, set in a garden. At the centre of this simple grassy garden is a {{perfectly}} preserved 19th century Hebridean crofter's blackhouse, of which there would have been thousands on Skye before the tragic Highland clearances. The house incorporates dry stone walls and a heather-thatched roof. Inside there is the simple furniture that would have been found in such a cottage as well as newspaper clippings related to the clearances. The smell of smoke is dominant, as there is no chimney to accommodate the open fire - just a hole in the roof. At the back of the garden there is more vegetation and two little huts where produce would have been stored, one of which contains a mock illegal whisky brewing plant. Lying around the garden there are various agricultural tools including an old rusty plow. The <b>self-service</b> ticket <b>office</b> is housed in a small shack with an upturned boat for a roof. Sheep often wander into the garden to graze making this not only an open-air museum but also a living museum.|$|R
