40|$|Background: The {{solubility}} {{of dental}} pulp tissue in <b>sodium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> {{has been extensively}} investigated but results have been inconsistent; due most likely to variations in experimental design, the volume and/or rate of replenishment of the solutions used {{and the nature of}} the tissues assessed. Traditionally, the <b>sodium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solutions</b> used for endodontic irrigation in Australia have been either Milton or commercial bleach, with Milton being the most common. Recently, a range of Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved proprietary <b>sodium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solutions,</b> which contain surfactant, has become available. Some domestic chlorine bleaches now also contain surfactants. The purpose of this study was to perform new solubility assessments, comparing Milton with new TGA approved products, Hypochlor 1 % and Hypochlor 4 % forte, and with a domestic bleach containing surfactant (White King). Methods: Ten randomly assigned pulp samples of porcine dental pulp of approximately equal dimensions were immersed in the above solutions, as well as representative concentrations of sodium hydroxide. Time to complete dissolution was measured and assessed statistically. Results: White King 4 % showed the shortest dissolution time, closely followed by Hypochlor 4 % forte. White King 1 % and Hypochlor 1 % each took around three times as long to completely dissolve the samples of pulp as their respective 4 % concentrations, while Milton took nearly 10 times as long. The sodium hydroxide solutions showed no noticeable dissolution of the pulp samples. Conclusions: The composition and content of <b>sodium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solutions</b> had a profound effect on the ability of these solutions to dissolve pulp tissue in vitro. Greater concentrations provided more rapid dissolution of tissue. One per cent solutions with added surfactant and which contained higher concentrations of sodium hydroxide were significantly more effective in dissolution of pulp tissue than Milton...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The goal of {{this study}} was to compare the {{dissolving}} potential of Dakin's solution with that of equivalent buffered and unbuffered <b>sodium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solutions</b> on fresh and decayed tissues. In addition, the antimicrobial effect of Dakin's solution and equivalent unbuffered hypochlorite was tested. STUDY DESIGN: Tissue specimens were obtained from freshly dissected pig palates. Unbuffered 2. 5 % and 0. 5 % <b>sodium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solutions</b> and 0. 5 % solutions buffered at a pH of 12 and a pH of 9 (Dakin's solution) were tested on fresh and decayed tissue. Tissue decay was assessed histologically. Antimicrobial testing was performed with Enterococcus faecalis in dentin blocks and on filter papers. RESULTS: The 2. 5 % NaOCl solution was substantially more effective than the three 0. 5 % solutions in dissolving the test tissues. Buffering had little effect on tissue dissolution, and Dakin's solution was equally effective on decayed and fresh tissues. No differences were recorded for the antibacterial properties of Dakin's solution and an equivalent unbuffered <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solution.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to earlier statements, the results of this study do not demonstrate any benefit from buffering <b>sodium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> with <b>sodium</b> bicarbonate according to Dakin's method.

40|$|Background: The current disease {{outbreak}} {{caused by the}} Ebola virus Makona variant (EBOV/Mak) has led to unprecedented morbidity and lethality given its geographic reach and sustained transmission. <b>Sodium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> and ethanol are well-accepted decontamination agents, however little published evidence supports the selection of appropriate concentrations and contact times. The present study addresses the environmental robustness of EBOV/Mak and evaluates the effectiveness of <b>sodium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> and ethanol as disinfectants. Methods: EBOV/Mak was suspended in a simulated organic soil load and dried onto surfaces. Viability was measured at 1 hour, 24 hours, 72 hours, and 192 hours. For the evaluation of disinfectants, EBOV/Mak in a simulated organic soil was dried onto stainless steel carriers and disinfected with 0. 01 % (v/v), 0. 1 % (v/v), 0. 5 % (v/v) and 1 % (v/v) <b>sodium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solutions</b> or 67 % (v/v) ethanol at contact times of 1, 5 or 10 minutes. Results: EBOV/Mak persisted longer on steel and plastic surfaces (192 hours) than cotton (< 24 hours). Dilute <b>sodium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> (0. 01 % and 0. 1 %) showed little antiviral action, whereas 0. 5 % and 1 % <b>sodium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> <b>solutions</b> demonstrated recoverable virus at one minute but sterilized surfaces in five minutes.
