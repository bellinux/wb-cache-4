40|$|The loads {{across the}} {{fracture}} depend on {{variables such as}} position of the fracture and the bite point. Up to now, no study has described systematically the influence of these two variables on these loads. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe and compare value and direction of the loads across the fracture for different positions of fractures in the mandible. In a three-dimensional model, bending and torsion moments and shear forces were compared for five mandibular fractures. The fractures were located in, respectively, the angle, posterior body, anterior body, canine and symphysis region. Positive bending moments were defined to give compression at the border, negative bending moments to give compression at the alveolar side of the mandible. The angle and posterior body fracture have high positive bending moments, small torsion moments and high <b>sheer</b> <b>forces.</b> The anterior body, canine and symphysis fracture have high negative bending moments and high torsion moments with similar maximum values. The number of bite points with negative bending moments were different for all fractures. These bite points were always located on the fractured side. It is concluded that mandibular fractures can be divided roughly into two groups with similar load patterns across the fracture. One group consists of angle and posterior body fractures, the other group consists of anterior body, canine and symphysis fractures...|$|E
30|$|Echocardiography is an {{important}} investigation in patients supported with ECMO. Transthoracic echocardiography is typically the first line cardiac imaging investigation in these patients [13]. However, up to 25  % of transthoracic echocardiograms may be non-diagnostic due to adverse ultrasound scanning conditions. These include patients being immobile, supine and attached to a ventilator, issues with accessing suitable acoustic windows and sub-optimal lighting conditions [14, 15]. Contrast-specific echocardiographic imaging modalities can help overcome these limitations and increase the diagnostic yield of echocardiography. However, echocardiographic contrast agents are hydrodynamically labile microspheres and likely {{to be prone to}} destruction within an ECMO circuit. There are multiple factors which can influence contrast microsphere stability, including the insonicating ultrasound power (mechanical index), ambient temperature, <b>sheer</b> <b>forces</b> and also the particle pressure of gases [16]. These contrast microspheres are likely to be prone to destruction within an ECMO circuit. In our research, this was demonstrated by a decrease in microbubble concentration at both infusion rates, with and without an oxygenator in situ and at all pump head speeds. Despite the statistically significant decrease in signal intensity through the circuit without an oxygenator, the smaller magnitude of drop suggests that the oxygenator contributes to a significantly greater degree of bubble destruction than in the pump head alone (75 versus 25  %, respectively). To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the site and quantify the degree of contrast microbubble destruction within an ECMO circuit.|$|E

Two packed-bed bioreactors with 80 -cm 3 lava chips as biofilm carrier were inoculated with nine Hg(II) -resistant natural isolates of a- and g-proteobacte-ria. Chloralkali wastewater containing ionic mercury (3. 0 to 9. 7 mg/L Hg 2 +), amended with sucrose and yeast ex-tract, flowed through the bioreactors at 160 mL/h. During the 16 -month investigation the bioreactors showed no sign of depleted performance in terms of mercury-retaining capacity. After 16 months, both bioreactors still retained 96 % of the mercury load. The performance of the bioreactors was sensitive to mechanical perturba-tions (e. g., <b>sheer</b> <b>forces</b> of gas bubbles). Shifts to higher Hg 2 + inflow concentrations initially decreased the mer-cury retention efficacy slightly. However, the bioreactors could adapt to Hg 2 + concentrations of up to 7. 6 mg/L within several days. Old biofilms were less affected than the younger ones. The performance of the bioreactors was not affected by an increase in temperature up to 41 °C and an increased volumetric load (up to 240 mL/h). The bioreactors regained activity spontaneously after the stress had stopped. Recovery could be accelerated by increased nutrient concentration, although this may lead to blocking of the packed bed. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons...|$|E
40|$|Offshore {{drilling}} is {{an operation}} performed to explore for and extract hydrocarbon beneath the seabed. The drilling operation {{is a very}} sensitive and extremely risky task and {{can be carried out}} from a floating vessel, semi-submersible and so on. Because of the high risk involved in drilling operations, the structural integrity and stability of the platform on which the drilling operation is performed are of uttermost importance {{to the success of the}} operation. In recent times, drilling operations are performed on mobile platforms most especially on semi-submersibles, thus the stability of this platform as well as the risk involved are worth given careful considerations and evaluations. In the past couple of years, the PSA has focused on hazards relating to floating installations and thus requested that more attention should be made by the industry on hazards relating to buoyancy loss and stability. Ballast systems play a very vital role to ensure vessel stability. The main function of the ballast system is to maintain stability and sufficient draft, and also to retain the <b>sheer</b> <b>forces</b> and bending moments within required limits. The ballast system comprises ballast tanks, different network of pipes, pumps and valve, hydraulic power system, electric power system and ballast control system. Failure to properly ballast may lead to accidents which could lead to loss of vessel, death of personnel and environmental disasters as in the case of Ocean Ranger accident in 1982, and Petrobras P- 34 FPSO in 2002 (Sobena, 2007). This thesis is aimed at evaluating the risks involved in ballast operations, by identifying the various failure modes of semi-submersible ballast systems and we will consider possible barriers and consequences due to the ballast system failure during drilling operation. The thesis focuses primarily on the failure mode effect and criticality analysis (FMECA) of the main components of the semi-submersible’s ballast system by determining the failure causes and failure modes that could influence each components performance, and thus identifying the most critical component(s). Also the Structured What-If Technique (SWIFT) is used to compensate for hazard identification for the unidentified hazards (i. e., human errors), in the FMECA. By studying the most critical system components, a qualitative risk analysis is conducted to model accidental sequences by using the fault tree method to establish the chain of failure events. In addition to this, a stability analysis of a typical semi-submersible based on ballast system is performed to assess the criticality of different ballast failure conditions such as damage condition, and ballast failure under different environmental conditions such as under harsh environment, polar low occurrence. In achieving these objectives, both qualitative risk analysis and evaluation methods are adopted...|$|E
40|$|The {{power of}} modern {{computer}} systems {{is due in}} no small part to their fantastic ability to adapt to whatever tasks they are charged with. Self-reconfigurable robots seek to provide that flexibility in hardware by building a system out of many individual modules, each with limited functionality, but with the ability to rearrange themselves to modify the shape and structure of the overall robotic system and meet whatever challenges are faced. Various hardware systems have been constructed for reconfigurable robots, and algorithms for them produce a wide variety of modes of locomotion. However, the task of efficiently controlling these complex systems [...] possibly with thousands or millions of modules comprising a single robot [...] is still not fully solved even after years of prior work on the topic. 	 	In this thesis, we investigate the topic of theoretical control algorithms for lattice-style self-reconfigurable robots. These robots are composed of modules attached to each other in discrete lattice locations and only move by transitioning from one lattice location to another adjacent location. In our work, given the physical limitations of modules in a robot, we show a lower bound for the time to reconfiguration that robot. That is, transition the robot from one connected arrangement of modules to a different connected arrangement. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm with a running time that matches this lower bound both for a specific example reconfiguration problem and for general reconfiguration between any pair of 2 D arrangements of modules. Since these algorithms match the demonstrated lower bound, they are optimal given the assumed abilities of the modules in the robot. 	 	In addition to our theoretically optimal reconfiguration algorithms, we also make contributions to the more practical side of of this robotics field with a novel, physically stable control algorithm. The majority of prior theoretical work on control algorithms for self-reconfigurable robots did not consider the effects of gravity upon the robot. The result is that these algorithms often transform a robot into configurations [...] arrangements of modules [...] which are unstable and would likely break hardware on a real robot with thousands or millions of modules. In this thesis we present an algorithm for locomotion of a self-reconfigurable robot which is always physically stable in the presence of gravity even though we assume limited abilities for the robot's modules to withstand tension or <b>sheer</b> <b>forces.</b> This algorithm is highly scalable, able to be efficiently run on a robot with millions of modules, demonstrates significant speed advantages over prior scalable locomotion algorithms, and is resilient to errors in module actions or message passing. Overall, the contributions of this thesis extend both the theoretical and practical limits of what is possible with control algorithms for self-reconfigurable robots. Dissertatio...|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional development goals like reliability, emission behaviour and energetic efficiency, the competition between the systems used for warming heating and drinking water is compelling the manufacturers of oil-fired heating systems to take increasingly into account product requirements such as adjustability, space requirements and operating noises, which {{have in the past}} been ignored. Above all, increasing importance is placed on reducing the lower power limit - which is at the moment around 15 kW for spray burners - against the background of a continuously falling need for heating energy. On the basis of these constraints, the pre-mixing surface burner for EL heating oil, developed as part of this work, provides a promising approach to a solution which links the possibility of metering minimal fuel mass flow rates with favourable emission behaviour, output dynamics and the virtually noiseless operation of this type of burner. To create the aerosol a superheated fuel jet is injected into the pre-mixing section of the burner via a closeable nozzle. As a result of the reduction in pressure at the nozzle outlet, vapour bubbles form with the injected jet, which is surrounded by air. The rapid growth of these vapour bubbles tears the liquid open. In addition, the kinetic forces of the internal turbulence and the <b>sheer</b> <b>forces</b> cause the liquid film to break up along the edges of the jet. In contrast to traditional methods of atomizing a liquid fuel much smaller drops are formed {{as a result of the}} overlaying of thermal and kinetic jet fragmentation. The injection device is designed as a volume-controlled metering system. A piston pump moves the fuel from a storage tank to the fuel heater. The injection nozzle is located at the outlet end of the fuel heater. Given a constant stroke volume the quantity of fuel which is injected is determined by the stroke frequency of the piston pump. Before the burner starts operating an electrical heating element heats the fuel to the required injection temperature. After the heater has operated for a brief period of time the hot reaction zone supplies the energy needed to heat up the fuel. The electrical heating element is either switched off, or activated at intervals in order to maintain a pre-set injection temperature. The fuel is heated under pressure in order to prevent the depositing of coke-like substances resulting from the liquid fuel phase. In order to provide a technical evaluation of the approach, a test burner with a power output of 2 - 10 kW was developed and examined on the basis of the following criteria: pollutant emission, flame stability, modulating operation, electrical energy requirement, noises and reliability. The results show that the nitrogen oxide emission and the surface burner noise level are considerably lower than those of conventional spray burners. (orig.)

40|$|For safety reasons, to {{preserve}} a proper appearance and to ensure a long life cycle, facades have to be maintained regularly. Until now, this {{has been done by}} human workers. However, due to overhangs and structurally weak facades, work on outer facades can be a difficult and dangerous job. Thus there is a high potential for the deployment of autonomous or remote controlled facade climbing robots. But for a facility management provider such a robot only becomes interesting if it is usable across a large number of buildings. In this context free climbing robots are the most appropriate system for an all-purpose deployment. The majority of existing free climbing robots use suction cups for attachment, which are actively provided with vacuum by an extra vacuum generator. In this context passively operated suction cups have the advantage that the attaching force is generated simply by mechanically pressing the suction cup onto the surface. In the scope of this work it is shown that the weight and the complexity of the robot system can be reduced and thus the flexibility of deployment and the reliability of free climbing robots could be increased by using passively operated suction cups. The chosen system for a free climbing robot with passively operated suction cups utilises the caterpillar principle for propulsion. In order to produce suitable pressure at the front suction cups a specific attach system for suction cup suspension has been developed in this work. To calculate the characteristic forces for this climbing system that affect the suction cups the necessary mathematical process has been developed and design rules for the minimization of these forces has been derived. The sheer load has been identified as being the critical load to the suction cups. Thus the focus of this work was the development of a mathematical model for the determination of the elastic and failure behaviour of passively operated suction cups. These forces cause slippage and thus the elastic and failure behavior of the suction cups. The mathematical model for simulating the determination of the coherence between <b>sheer</b> <b>forces</b> and slippage drift {{as a function of the}} normal force has been worked out on the basis of the finite element method, and has been verified by tests. Therefore a two dimensional friction model has been developed and a new parameter to consider material expansion in the normal direction has been introduced. In an exemplary test series it has been verified that the model reproduces real conditions to an adequate accuracy. For practical use this basic system can be used for the dimensioning of passively operated suctions cups and thus for the dimensioning of climbing robots for glass facades. On the basis of this knowledge a prototype for a free climbing and autonomous robot for glass facades has been built and tested. The tests have been carried out on the functionality of the new climbing mechanism on the basis of a caterpillar with passively operated suction cups, and of the behaviour of the suction cups with different loads and different patterns of suction cup arrangements. The functionality of the climbing mechanism has been proven. Important knowledge for the optimisation of the climbing mechanism has been obtained from the interpretation of the behaviour of the suction cups during the testing in comparison with the results of the mathematical model...|$|E
40|$|The {{basic problem}} of {{operating}} a boiling water nuclear reactor (BWR) {{is that of}} maximizing the power output while avoiding fuel rod over-heating (dry-out). For the safe operation of BWRs this entails a detailed understanding {{of the flow of}} water and steam through the reactor core. In a BWR the water functions not only as a coolant, but also as a moderator for the neutrons emitted in the fission process. To describe the thermohydraulic properties of the reactor a number of parameters are of common interest. Examples of such parameters are void, pressure, temperature, water and steam velocities, pressure, <b>sheer</b> <b>forces</b> and turbulent kinetic energy. There are a few ways of revealing these values such as experiments built up to behave like a reactors and computer simulations using models based on the laws of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. This research concerns a computer based model which uses a continuous fluid dynamic, (CFD), calculation program called OpenFOAM (Open Field Operation and Manipulation). OpenFOAM uses Navier Stokes equations for continuity, momentum- and energy conservation to simulate flows. The method used in this research has been to first build a model which describes the adiabatic flow correctly by using an already existing solver which uses the continuity and momentum conservation laws. In order to achieve a model that can solve temperature distributions in the flow the energy equation is added to the program coding in OpenFOAM. There are totally 12 turbulence models. Some of the models have not produced results on account of that they either diverged or needed input that was not attainable. The models which were tested and used were four k -ε models, one RSTM model and two low-Re models. A question that is addressed in this report is which of the many turbulence models that describes the experimental flow most correctly. The low-Re model LienLeschzinerLowRe produces the results with best congruence to the experimental data. The k -ε models model RNGkEpsilon and the RSTM model LRR were also fairly close. It is found that there are a few turbulence models that describe the experimental flows sufficiently well. LaunderSharmaKe was the turbulence model which simulated the temperature distribution best and was almost within the error bar limit of 5 K in all of the plots. It is interesting that the two low-Re models show the best results if only one characteristic at the time is studied. One of the turbulence models describes only the velocity profile well and the other one oppositely describes the temperature distribution the best. It can thereby be stated that if the user wants a turbulence model that describes both velocity profiles and temperature distribution the RSTM model LRR is the best one. If on the other hand computer capacity is a limiting factor it might be profitable to use the simpler k -ε model RNGkEpsilon. An other conclusions of this thesis is that the LRR and RNGkepsilon models are suited for the simulations of the geometries described in this work provided that the channel is wide enough for the model to simulate a correct temperature profile. With the use of gmsh a case geometry with wider channel area could easily be created. It would of course be necessary to use experimental data to validate the assumption that more realistic results can be obtained on wider channels...|$|E
