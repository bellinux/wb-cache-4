I presently discovered that the family treasury contained still another feature--a jewel of some sort, apparently--and that she was trying to get around speaking squarely about it, lest I get paralysed again. But I wanted to known about that thing, too, and urged her to tell me what it was. She was afraid. But I insisted, and said I would brace myself this time and be prepared, then the shock would not hurt me. She was full of misgivings, but the temptation to reveal that marvel to me and enjoy my astonishment and admiration was too strong for her, and she confessed that she had it on her person, and said that if I was sure I was prepared--and so on and so on--and with that <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> her bosom and brought out a battered square of brass, watching my eye anxiously the while.

50|$|House recalls that, {{during the}} bus ride, Amber sneezed, {{reached for a}} Kleenex, and complained {{that she had the}} flu. He then recalls what caused his concern; after she wiped her nose, <b>she</b> <b>reached</b> <b>into</b> her purse and pulled out {{prescription}} pills, {{which turned out to be}} amantadine. She took a heavy dose of two or three amantadine pills, right as the garbage truck plowed into the bus. The crash caused such extensive anatomical and physiological trauma (especially the blood loss and shock from her leg injury) that she ended up suffering from acute renal failure. This damage to her kidneys made them unable to adequately filter out the amantadine, causing her to overdose and thus causing all of her unexplained symptoms. Wilson suggests dialysis as a treatment, but House tells him during the memory of the moments leading up to the bus crash that unfiltered amantadine binds to proteins in the kidneys and therefore dialysis is unable to clear it from the blood. Ultimately, there is no treatment for Amber. House and Wilson begin to cry, and House goes into a seizure while still connected to the deep brain stimulation equipment. The seizure makes the equipment shift, causing House's brain to bleed, leading to him falling into a coma.|$|E

Between these are clips of the young boy in the aftermath of his father's death. After seeing his mother reminiscing on her lost husband, the young boy finds money in the house and takes to the street, later seen buying a gun from someone in an alley.
