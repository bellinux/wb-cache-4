40|$|Several {{thousand}} independent {{processes are}} required to produce a single semicon-doctor chip. This thesis focuses on one: the process of coating a silicon wafer with photoresist. The conventional spin coating method produces uniform photoresist coating of the desired thickness. However, conventional spin coating wastes 95 % of the photoresist applied for every batch process. As photoresist is not recyclable, spin coating method is very inefficient. Moreover, an imminent increase in cost of photoresist has raised the demand for new coating technologies. Various methods for improving coating efficiency have been investigated. Based upon a comprehensive literature search and theoretical analysis, dramatic increases in efficiency and reductions in costs proved to be possible with the optimization of the dispense stage in spin coating. In the novel dispense process developed in this thesis, extrusion-spin coating replaces the conventional dispense stage. A major advantage of this method is its compatability with current spin coating method: little modification of existing <b>spin</b> <b>coaters</b> is required for this new technology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There {{are high}} {{interests}} among the researchers and industries for effective deposition of thick layer liquid photo-resists with {{applications such as}} fabrication of microfluidics and polymeric membranes using lithography. In this paper, we study performance of different techniques of coating for thick layers of SU- 8 using spin coating, self planarization and a technique of sandwiching the resin between two parallel solid plates. Deposition using <b>spin</b> <b>coaters</b> for SU- 8 2075 is limited hardly to around 250 µm with some irregularities such as edge-beads. Self-planarization requires enough resting time. We have achieved a thickness of around 1 mm in a single coating but is limited to only thick layers in reasonable time. The sandwich technique {{can be used for}} any thickness and is very fast. We present here a comparison of the three mentioned methods according to our observed data of the coating time, uniformity of the coating surface and capability of coating thick layers for a high viscosity SU- 8 2075 that is employed in fabrication of microfluidics micro-structures...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in exploring the use of conductive polymers for protecting metals from corrosion. The corrosion resistance of steel coated with the conductive polymer polypheneylenevinylene (PPV) is studied. The corrodant used is deaerated 1 % w/w NaCl(aq). The PPV coating is deposited by a homemade <b>spinning</b> <b>coater.</b> The effect of substrate microstructure and surface treatment on PPV coating morphology is investigated. The morphology and surface roughness of the coating are measured by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The PPV coating thickness and substrate surface roughness are measured by profilometer. Open Circuit Potential (OCP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), linear potentiodynamic voltammetry (Tafel) and optical microscopy were used to characterize the structure and properties of the coatings. The correlation between the coating thickness, the surface treatment of the steel substrate prior to coating, and the corrosion behaviour of PPV coated steel was investigated. Under the condition of our studies, the level of pH in the solution used for corrosion testing has the strongest effect on the corrosion behaviour of PPV coated steel...|$|R
40|$|A set of {{different}} processes using wet chemistry {{are necessary for}} a microfabrication line. Cleaning, coating, developing, etching, coating removal, lift-off. In semiconductor fabrication lines these processes are performed in <b>spin</b> <b>coaters,</b> cleaners, etch tools, and others. To fulfil the requirements of homogeneity, cleanliness, low particulate emission, and high throughput, these tools are highly specialised and expensive. Otherwise, for manufacturing microsystem devices a strong demand for less expensive and flexible work stations is expected. Tools commerically available offer an integration of {{only a small number}} of steps in one machine. An important goal is to have a set of processes in one machine instead of two or more. This reduces the capital expenditures, the need for clean room area, the costs for installation, and danger of particulate contamination by handling from step to step. Furthermore, the number of SMIF stations and handlers is reduced. Designing new equipment by us ing modules seems to be necessary. Thereby, machines will be adopted to different applications by changing or omitting the modules relevant or unnecessary for the processes of interest. Customers' demands can be satisfied within a short time and machines already installed can easily be modified for a new application. The design of new equipment is presented. The essential parts are modules which can be interchanged. The advantages of the new design are described...|$|R
50|$|Photolithography is {{a process}} in {{removing}} select portions of thin films used in microfabrication. Microfabrication is the production of parts on the micro- and nano- scale, typically {{on the surface of}} silicon wafers for the production of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Photolithography makes this process possible through the combined used of hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), photoresist (positive or negative), a <b>spin</b> <b>coater,</b> photomask, an exposure system and other various chemicals. By carefully manipulating these factors it is possible to create nearly any geometry microstructure on the surface of a silicon wafer. The chemical interaction between all the different components and the surface of the silicon wafer makes photolithography an interesting chemistry problem. Current science has been able to create features on the surface of silicon wafers between 1 and 100 µm.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{method to}} {{increase}} adhesion of photoresist on the silicon wafer surface {{is to treat}} the wafer with Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). A new silicon wafer has a polar surface and has some adsorbed water on the surface. The wafer can undergo a dehydration bake to remove adsorbed water, and followed by the HMDS treatment {{also known as the}} priming stage. HMDS can be dispensed in liquid form onto the wafer using a syringe while the wafer is attached to a vacuum chuck in a <b>spin</b> <b>coater.</b> HMDS can also be applied in gas form in the process known as the vapor prime. The HMDS promotes good photoresist-to-wafer adhesion because it ensures the wafer surface is hydrophobic. After HMDS treatment the silicon surface oxide becomes silated, leaving a non-polar surface. The pristine silicon (100) face has a surface energy value of 56.9 mN/m, which is reduced to a value of 44.1 mN/m after HMDS treatment The molecular formula for hexamethyldisilazane is C6H19NSi2.|$|E
50|$|Due to the miniscular {{magnitude}} of output {{generated by a}} single nanoactuator the necessity to use arrays of such actuators to accomplish a higher task comes into picture. Conventional methods like chemical vapor deposition (CVD) allow the exact placement of nanotubes by growing them directly on the substrate. However, such methods are unable to produce very high qualities of MWNT. Moreover, CVD is a high temperature process that would severely limit the compatibility with other materials in the system. A Si substrate is coated with electron beam resist and soaked in acetone to leave only a thin polymer layer. The substrate is selectively exposed to an low energy electron beam of an SEM that activates the adhesive properties of the polymer later. This forms {{the basis for the}} targeting method. The alignment method exploits the surface velocity obtained by a fluid as it flows off a spinning substrate. MWNTs are suspended in orthodicholrobenzene (ODCB) by ultrasonication in an aquasonic bath that separates most MWNT bundles into individual MWNTs. Drops of this suspension are then pipetted one by one onto the center of a silicon substrate mounted on a <b>spin</b> <b>coater</b> rotating at 3000 rpm. Each subsequent drop of the suspension is pipetted only after the previous drop has completely dried to ensure larger density and better alignment of the MWNTs (90% of the MWNTs over 1 µm long lie within 1°). Standard electron beam lithography is used to pattern the remaining components of the nanoactuators.|$|E
40|$|Photolithography of {{multi-level}} channel {{features in}} microfluidics is laborious and/or costly. Grayscale photolithography is mostly used with positive photoresists and conventional front side exposure, but the grayscale masks needed are generally costly and positive photoresists are not {{commonly used in}} microfluidic rapid prototyping. Here we introduce a simple and inexpensive alternative that uses pseudo-grayscale (pGS) photomasks in combination with backside diffused light lithography (BDLL) and the commonly used negative photoresist, SU- 8. BDLL can produce smooth multi-level channels of gradually changing heights without use of true grayscale masks because {{of the use of}} diffused light. Since the exposure is done through a glass slide, the photoresist is cross-linked from the substrate side up enabling well-defined and stable structures to be fabricated from even unspun photoresist layers. In addition to providing unique structures and capabilities, the method is compatible with the "garage microfluidics" concept of creating useful tools at low cost since pGS BDLL can be performed with the use of only hot plates and a UV transilluminator: equipment commonly found in biology labs. Expensive <b>spin</b> <b>coaters</b> or collimated UV aligners are not needed. To demonstrate the applicability of pGS BDLL, a variety of weir-type cell traps were constructed with a single UV exposure to separate cancer cells (MDA-MB- 231, 10 - 15 μm in size) from red blood cells (RBCs, 2 - 8 μm in size) as well as follicle clusters (40 - 50 μm in size) from cancer cells (MDA-MB- 231, 10 - 15 μm in size) close 1...|$|R

The atomic composition and microstructure of deposited GaN thin films were characterized using Energy Dispersive of X-ray (EDX) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).

40|$|An {{extensive}} two- and three-dimensional {{analysis of}} air flow in a POLARIS ® 2200 Microlithography Cluster <b>spin</b> <b>coater</b> was conducted using FLuENTTM Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. To supplement this analysis, direct measurement of air flow velocity was also performed using a Dantec ® Hot Wire Anemometer. Velocity measurements were made along two major planes {{across the entire}} flow field in the <b>spin</b> <b>coater</b> at various operating conditions. {{it was found that}} the flow velocity at the <b>spin</b> <b>coater</b> inlet is much lower than previously assumed and quite nonuniform. Based on this observation, a pressure boundary condition rather than a velocity boundary condition was used for subsequent CFD analysis. A comparison between calculated results and experimental data shows that the 3 D model accurately predicts the air flow field in the spin coaler. An added advantage of this approach is that the CFD model can be easily generated from the mechanical design database and used to analyze the effect of design changes. The modeled and measured results show that the flow pattern in the spin bowl is affected by interactions between the spinning wafer, exhaust flow, and the gap between the spin head and surrounding baffle. Different operating conditions such as spin speed, inlet pressure, and exhaust pressure were found to generate substantially different flow patterns. It was also found that backflow of air could be generated under certain conditions...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Researchers {{around the}} world use various solution-based {{deposition}} techniques to deposit thin films with multiple layers that typically require multiple rounds of deposition. Some such techniques include successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), and layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition. One of the main issues with deposition {{of these types of}} films is the labor intensive aspect. The SILAR and LBL techniques typically take from tens of minutes to hours for deposition. The laborious processes hinder the application of these techniques for the fabrication of more complex film structures such as functionally graded films. The need for a programmable and more flexible process inspired the research and development for a laboratory scale system that could deliver the precursor solutions on-demand. The system features an in-situ mixing capability that is ideal for the fabrication of functionally graded thin films. The prototype system presented in this work is currently called multiple solution delivery system. This system was originally envisioned to be paired with a <b>spin</b> <b>coater</b> such that a researcher could program recipes in the system and <b>spin</b> <b>coater,</b> start operation and leave the system to deliver the solutions when necessary. This would allow the researcher to spend time on other, more cognitively challenging endeavors while the deposition took place. It would also relieve the researcher from the duty of preparing several solutions of different concentrations as the system could mix solutions to create a delivered solution of different concentrations for different layers. After intensive research into available systems, and several rounds of discussion on the system requirements, it was decided that a custom system was most appropriate. A design process was used to design the system. A syringe pump based delivery system was chosen for the ease of varying reservoir size and resolution of dispensing. The system went through multiple revisions, pre and post construction. The final embodiment was calibrated, further tested for mixing and paired with a <b>spin</b> <b>coater</b> for thin film deposition. Documentation, {{in the form of a}} component list, operations manual and commented code, was also prepared and is presented...|$|E

Thus, by slicing the VACNT–PDMS composite block into 25  µm thick slices and discarding the top slice, CNT blockage by PDMS is minimised.|$|E
