Although Anderson wrote all the music and lyrics, he co-credited the writing to a fictional schoolboy named Gerald Bostock.

[...] Writing in the Toronto Star, Greg Quill said that the pilot introduced Brisco as [...] "a western in the loosest use of the term".

500|$|Conversely, YouTube {{has also}} allowed {{government}} to more easily engage with citizens, the White House's official YouTube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on YouTube in 2012 and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned Obama impersonator Iman Crosson's YouTube music video <b>spoof</b> <b>to</b> encourage young Americans {{to enroll in}} the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)-compliant health insurance. In February 2014, U.S. President Obama held {{a meeting at the}} White House with leading YouTube content creators to not only promote awareness of Obamacare but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the [...] "YouTube Generation". Whereas YouTube's inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted, the YouTube content creators' new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website's distracting content and fickle audience.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 2015, Dan's Papers, {{a weekly}} {{lifestyle}} publication in the Hamptons area of Long Island, New York, initiated satirical news spoofs featuring the [...] "Hamptons Police Submarine Unit" [...] that caricaturized the affluent area's police department {{acquisition of a}} [...] "military surplus" [...] Virginia class submarine for routine ocean patrols and law enforcement, with similar tongue-in-cheek overtones of excessive militarization of police. [...] While perhaps clearly a <b>spoof</b> <b>to</b> an informed reader, the news reports were otherwise realistic and of consequent readership response that the paper later featured a spoof local investigation titled [...] "Area Man Reveals Hamptons Police Submarine Story as Hoax." [...] The satire was also of sufficient quality to eventually lead {{to the creation of}} a Snopes.com refutation of the existence of such an expensive ($2.688 Billion) military surplus acquisition for local police department usage.|$|E

50|$|During the mid-2000s, it was {{discovered}} that calls emanating from the handset registered against a voicemail account were put straight through to voicemail without needing to enter a PIN.

5000|$|Advertising parodies - too {{numerous}} to catalog, though many {{have been written by}} Dick DeBartolo; these have ranged from TV ad <b>spoofs</b> <b>to</b> national print campaigns to home marketing and have long provided one of the most durable sources of the magazines humor.

50|$|Proxies make {{tampering}} with an internal {{system from the}} external network more difficult, so that misuse of one internal system would not necessarily cause a security breach exploitable from outside the firewall (as long as the application proxy remains intact and properly configured). Conversely, intruders may hijack a publicly reachable system {{and use it as}} a proxy for their own purposes; the proxy then masquerades as that system to other internal machines. While use of internal address spaces enhances security, crackers may still employ methods such as IP <b>spoofing</b> <b>to</b> attempt to pass packets to a target network.|$|R

5000|$|The film {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. The Hindu gave a review stating [...] "While the audience laughs and claps at the spoof, the movie disappoints in the acting skills. The audience seemed oblivious to it though. All actors appear very raw. Some scenes looked {{straight out of}} a low budget slow Telugu TV serial. The director seems to have handled the situation well, with one after another clichéd scenes coming with a pun. The director has smartly avoided making the movie a <b>spoof</b> <b>to</b> belittle the Telugu movie industry and larger-than-life heroes. It’s just a fun take on typical masala movies." ...|$|E

50|$|ARP is a {{stateless}} protocol. Network hosts {{will automatically}} cache any ARP replies they receive, {{regardless of whether}} network hosts requested them. Even ARP entries {{that have not yet}} expired will be overwritten when a new ARP reply packet is received. There is no method in the ARP protocol by which a host can authenticate the peer from which the packet originated. This behavior is the vulnerability that allows ARP <b>spoofing</b> <b>to</b> occur.|$|R
50|$|If a user chooses <b>to</b> <b>spoof</b> {{his or her}} MAC {{address in}} order to protect the user's privacy, this is called {{identity}} masking. One might wish to do this because, as an example, on a Wi-Fi network connection a MAC address is not encrypted. Even the secure IEEE 802.11i-2004 (WPA) encryption method does not prevent Wi-Fi networks from sending out MAC addresses. Hence, in order to avoid being tracked, the user might choose <b>to</b> <b>spoof</b> the device's MAC address. However, hackers use the same technique to maneuver around network permissions without revealing their identity. Some networks use MAC filtering in order to prevent unwanted access. Hackers can use MAC <b>spoofing</b> <b>to</b> get access to a particular network and do some damage. Hackers' MAC spoofing pushes the responsibility for any illegal activity onto authentic users. As a result, the real offender may go undetected by law enforcement.|$|R
