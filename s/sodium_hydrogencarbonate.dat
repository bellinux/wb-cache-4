When cobalt (II) ion is {{oxidized}} by {{hydrogen peroxide}} {{in the presence}} of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogencarbonate,</b> a green color-ation occurs indicating formation of a carbonato complex of cobalt (III).

The intermediates esters 2 were not isolated but directly, after evaporation of the ether, coupled in acetone/water using palladium acetate {{in the presence}} of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogencarbonate.</b> Yields of isolated compounds 1 were about 40 %.

40|$|Two {{bacterial}} strains, 127 W and T 102, {{were isolated}} from anoxic crude oil tank sludge as effective degraders of dibenzothiophene (DBT), a model sulfur containing heterocyclic aromatic compound in crude oil. Strain 127 W was more tolerant to oxygen limitation than T 102 and {{was capable of}} degrading two- and three-ring polycyclic and heterocyclic aromatic compounds under both aerobic and low oxygen conditions. Strain 127 W degraded 0. 082, 0. 055, and 0. 064 mM of DBT, naphthalene, and anthracene, respectively, in one week with dissolved oxygen <= 0 : 2 ppm (0. 006 mM). Degradation by 127 W cell-free extracts for DBT was increased by addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogencarbonate</b> under this oxygen concentration.

40|$|Background. Ethylene glycol, usually {{ingested}} by coincidence, causes uncommon but serious poisoning {{which could}} have fatal consequences without prompt diagnosis and treatment. Ethylene glycol itself has a low toxicity but is rapidly degraded to toxic metabolites, {{that are responsible for}} typical clinical presentation. Metabolic acidosis, increased anion and osmolal gap are typical laboratory findings. Application of antidotes ethanol and fomepizol, hemodyalisis and correction of metabolic acidosis are mainstays of therapy. Patients and methods. A case of concurrent ethanol and ethylene glycol ingestion is presented. On admission diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning was supported by heteroanamnestic data, typical clinical presentation and laboratory findings and latter confirmed with body fluid analysis. Despite therapy with ethanol, <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogencarbonate</b> and parenteral hydration patient developed acute renal failure which required hemodyalisis. Conclusions. Concurrent ingestion of spirit improved prognosis of ingestion of lethal ethylene glycol dose. Due to late arrival adequate and immediate in-hospital management could not prevent acute renal failure and subsequent hemodyalisis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Gel-based and membrane-based {{flow-through}} immunoassay formats {{were investigated}} for rapid ochratoxin A (OTA) detection in red wine. The flow-through set-Up consisted of an antibody containing gel or membrane {{placed at the}} bottom of a standard solid-phase extraction column (i. e the flow-through column), combined with a clean-up column. Different clean-up methods were studied for red wine clarification and purification The optimal method consisted of passing wine, diluted with an aqueous Solution containing 1 % polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) and 5 % <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogencarbonate,</b> through strong anion exchange (SAX) silica. An immunoassay for OTA detection in red wine was optimized and a cut-off level at 2 mu g L- 1 according to EU legislation was achieved with both formals A more significant colour difference between blank and spiked samples was observed for the gel-based assay making this superior to the inembiane-based assay The proposed rapid gel-based test was compared with a standard immunoaffinity column - high-performance liquid chromatography - fluorescent detection (IAC-HPLC-FLD) method and a good correlation of the results was obtained for naturally contaminated wine sample...|$|E
40|$|In this communication, it is {{reported}} the first relevant results on a broad study on the preparation of calcium carbonate as precipitated nanoparticles of the polymorphs vaterite and calcite. The inorganic precursors are calcium nitrate tetrahydrate and <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogencarbonate,</b> and the organic additive is sucrose in aqueous solution. The crystalline phases are studied by X-Ray powder diffraction, using a quantitative method, and the particle morphologies using scanning electron microscopy. When the organic additive is not used, calcite as the most thermodynamically stable polymorph is precipitated as nanocrystalline predominant phase (83 %) mixed with vaterite. Using {{a high concentration of}} the organic additive (67 %), vaterite is precipitated as the nanocrystalline predominant phase (> 98 %). Using the additive in variable proportion produces the precipitation of the 2 polymorphs, being vaterite always the predominant phase. The morphology of the precipitated calcium carbonate shows nanospherical uniform particles with irregular contourns of vaterite and characteristic rhomboedral particles of calcite when this phase is present. According to the biocompatibility, this material shows interest in applications as biomaterial in bone implants. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A new {{analytical}} method for {{the determination of}} ochratoxin A (OTA) in red wine has been developed by using a double-extract cleanup and a fluorometric measurement after spectral deconvolution. Wine samples were diluted with a solution containing 1 % polyethylene glycol and 5 % <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogencarbonate,</b> filtered, and purified by immunoaffinity and aminopropyl solid-phase column. OTA contents in the purified extract were determined by a spectrofluorometer (excitation wavelength, 330 nm; emission wavelength, 470 nm) after deconvolution of fluorescence spectra. Average recoveries from wine samples spiked with OTA at levels ranging from 0. 5 to 3. 0 ng/mL were 94. 5 – 105. 4 % with relative standard deviations (RSD) of < 15 % (n = 4). The limit of detection (LOD) was 0. 2 ng/mL, and the total time of analysis was 30 min. The developed method was tested on 18 red wine samples (naturally contaminated and spiked with OTA at levels ranging from 0. 4 to 3. 0 ng/mL) and compared with AOAC Official Method 2001. 01, based on immunoaffinity column cleanup and HPLC with fluorescence detector. A good correlation (r 2 = 0. 9765) was observed between OTA levels obtained with the two methods, highlighting {{the reliability of the}} proposed method, the main advantage of which is the simple OTA determination by a benchtop fluorometer with evident reductions of cost and time of analysis...|$|E
