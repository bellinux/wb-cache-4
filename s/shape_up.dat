Diverse internal transept chamber plans exist within the group.

Dan Rydell, his co-anchor, tries to get back his positive attitude, while J.J. and the network executives begin to get vocal about his need to improve or leave the company. Dana Whitaker, his producer, vociferously defends him to the executive producer, Isaac Jaffe, even while she tries to get him to <b>shape</b> <b>up</b> before they override her shielding of him. At the same time, Casey himself is thinking about quitting sports broadcasting, citing the moral decay he's seen on the job, in spite of Dan's observation that he'd only be doing it for the wrong reasons. Dana also hires a new associate producer, the highly strung but brilliant Jeremy Goodwin, who co-producer Natalie Hurley takes a liking to.

500|$|After 5000 BCE new {{waves of}} {{immigrants}} {{arrived from the}} south again, which accelerated the process of differentiation of the agrarian society into several distinct cultures {{during the first half}} of 5th millennium BC and afterwards. In the Oder River basin mostly there was the culture named after the punctured variety of Linear Band pottery - Stroked Pottery culture, while in the Vistula River basin the Lengyel and Polgár cultures appeared. The two regions developed in some separation, but within them the different cultural traditions of the younger Danubian circle often overlapped. The houses were now of an elongated trapezoidal <b>shape,</b> <b>up</b> to 40 meters long, grouped in larger complexes, often protected by beam and earth walls, moats and other fortifications, as such defensive measures apparently became necessary against people from the still Mesolithic native population or other Danubian settlements. These defensive structures, built from the mid 5th millennium BCE on, were complicated and consumed significant time and resources. Their design followed that of the similar construction that was taking place in the Danube River areas, starting in the early part of this millennium. Large cemeteries and graves supplied with fancier objects such as jewelry, including the first so-called [...] "princely" [...] graves (the princesses had imported copper necklaces, earrings and diadems in addition to locally made decorations), testify to the emergence of a relatively more affluent society. Cattle raising and trading (large varieties resulted from cross-breeding with the aurochs) and land tillage provided basic sustenance. Salt was obtained and traded and became a much sought after commodity, at first probably to help preserve stored food. The salt springs around Wieliczka were utilized already by the Lengyel culture people, who left ceramic vessels used in salt production there. The Danubian people produced many richly decorated objects, including clay containers with animal head ornaments and figurines of women.|$|E

[...] The special Senate committee investigated alleged improprieties and gaming of the rate structure, such as carriers padlocking individual pieces of mail to increase weight. Despite showings that Brown's administration of the air mail had increased the efficiency of the service and lowered its costs from $1.10 to $0.54 per mile, and the obvious partisan politics involved in investigating {{what appeared to be a}} Republican scandal involving Herbert Hoover by a Democratic-controlled committee, the hearings raised serious questions regarding its legality and ethics.|$|E

2500|$|Inspired by a {{performance}} of Japanese taiko drummers Witer formed Big Pig: [...] "When I saw them, the key to it was orchestration – that each guy had his own part. There was no improvisation at all. So from that point on, I {{knew how to do}} it. It {{was just a matter of}} getting the right people". The initial incarnation involved eight or nine drummers, with Witer trying to sing over the poly-rhythmic din; while members of the band came and went. At an early gig Witer's former band mate, Sherine Abeyratne, attended and subsequently joined the ensemble. As a vocalist, she had been a member of various groups: Grand Wazoo, The Editions, Bang, Big Choir, Bob Starkie <b>Shape</b> <b>Up,</b> Gospel Truth, Jo Jo Zep Band, Black Coffee, Dianna Boss and The Extremes, and The Rock Party. In 1988 Sherine recalled [...] "I started joining bands eight years ago, as long as the music was high-energy, really strong, that was the criterion". She had also toured with INXS as a backing vocalist. Another early member was Nick Disbray on vocals and percussion.|$|E
2500|$|A {{subsequent}} {{civil case}} trial {{was held in}} 1998 with the charges that the Ku Klux Klan incited the crime. The case was brought to court by the Southern Poverty Law Center, represented by attorney Morris Dees. The lawyer for the Klan insisted that the criminals acted alone in burning down the church. Defense attorney Gary White painted the Klan Grand Dragon Horace King as a feeble old man merely exercising his right to free speech, saying King never authorized the arson. During the trial, the Church's lawyers showed racist Klan posters and literature and played a videotape for the jury showing King speaking at a Klan rally, saying [...] "It's time, people, {{to wake up and}} <b>shape</b> <b>up</b> and say this is our country, white people, take it back." [...] The Klan leaders insisted that they never encouraged anyone to break the law, but two of the sentenced arsonists testified against their case. Welch testified, [...] "The church fire was Klan business, and we were told we would not go to jail. We were convinced we were untouchable." [...] Both Welch and Cox said that they testified against the Klan to atone for what they'd done.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson who {{had used}} a camera as an observer, {{reported}} to Roosevelt, to the Navy leaders, and to Congress that conditions were deplorable and unacceptable. He argued that the South West Pacific urgently needed a higher priority and {{a larger share of}} war supplies. The warplanes sent there, for example, were [...] "far inferior" [...] to Japanese planes, and morale was bad. He told Forrestal that the Pacific Fleet had a [...] "critical" [...] need for 6,800 additional experienced men. Johnson prepared a twelve-point program to upgrade the effort in the region, stressing [...] "greater cooperation and coordination within the various commands and between the different war theaters." [...] Congress responded by making Johnson chairman of a high-powered subcommittee of the Naval Affairs Committee, with a mission {{similar to that of the}} Truman Committee in the Senate. He probed the peacetime [...] "business as usual" [...] inefficiencies that permeated the naval war and demanded that admirals <b>shape</b> <b>up</b> and get the job done. Johnson went too far when he proposed a bill that would crack down on the draft exemptions of shipyard workers if they were absent from work too often; organized labor blocked the bill and denounced him. Johnson's biographer, Robert Dallek concludes, [...] "The mission was a temporary exposure to danger calculated to satisfy Johnson's personal and political wishes, but it also represented a genuine effort on his part, however misplaced, to improve the lot of America's fighting men." ...|$|E
