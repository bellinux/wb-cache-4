40|$|Understanding <b>spatial</b> <b>controls</b> on {{wildfires}} {{is important}} when designing adaptive fire management plans and optimizing fuel treatment locations on a forest landscape. Previous research about this topic {{focused primarily on}} <b>spatial</b> <b>controls</b> for fire origin locations alone. Fire spread and behavior were largely overlooked. This paper contrasts {{the relative importance of}} biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic constraints on the spatial pattern of fire occurrence with that on burn probability (i. e., the probability that fire will spread to a particular location). Spatial point pattern analysis and landscape succession fire model (LANDIS) were used to create maps to show the contrast. We quantified <b>spatial</b> <b>controls</b> on both fire occurrence and fire spread in the Midwest Ozark Highlands region, USA. This area exhibits a typical anthropogenic surface fire regime. We found that (I) human accessibility and land ownership were primary limiting factors in shaping clustered fire origin locations; (2) vegetation and topography had a negligible influence on fire occurrence in this anthropogenic regime; (3) burn probability was higher in grassland and open woodland than in closed-canopy forest, even though fire occurrence density was les...|$|R

It combines analytical advantages of chemiluminescent analysis (absence of background optical signal) with ease of reaction control by applying electrode potential. As an analytical technique it presents outstanding advantages over other common analytical methods due to its versatility, simplified optical setup compared with photoluminescence (PL), and good temporal and <b>spatial</b> <b>control</b> compared with chemiluminescence (CL). Enhanced selectivity of ECL analysis is reached by variation of electrode potential thus controlling species that are oxidized/reduced at the electrode and take part in ECL reaction (see electrochemical analysis).|$|E
50|$|Three general {{classes of}} {{regulators}} of Rho protein signaling have been identified: guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEFs), GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). GEFs activate Rho proteins by catalyzing {{the exchange of}} GDP for GTP. GAPs control {{the ability of the}} GTPase to hydrolyze GTP to GDP, controlling the natural rate of movement from the active conformation to the inactive conformation. GDI proteins form a large complex with the Rho protein, helping to prevent diffusion within the membrane and into the cytosol and thus acting as an anchor and allowing tight <b>spatial</b> <b>control</b> of Rho activation.|$|E

If these methods mask disemployment effects, {{it would not be}} surprising that they also suggest better distributional effects. Regardless, we see again (although with fewer studies) that conclusions more supportive of using the minimum wage to increase income from work hinge on a particular identification strategy. Second, it is difficult to view the evidence from the existing literature as consistent with Dube’s findings. Nearly all of the estimates reviewed in his Table 1 for large representative samples fail to find statistically significant evidence that minimum wages reduce poverty, although many are negative. 42 Third, other recent work suggests that Dube’s conclusions are fragile. Sabia (2014) reports that with a longer sample period (1979 – 2012 versus 1990 – 2012), the types of specifications Dube advocates fail to point to significant effects of minimum wages on poverty (or extreme poverty), although from a policy perspective we may be interested in what more recent data show. Sabia also reports that Dube’s specification with <b>spatial</b> <b>controls</b> delivers weaker anti-poverty results when the sample conditions on workers, whereas we should expect stronger results—perhaps suggestive of model misspecification—although he does not show that the specification without <b>spatial</b> <b>controls</b> is free of this problem.|$|R

30|$|ADRZ {{assert that}} {{the basis of our}} {{critique}} was that their <b>spatial</b> <b>controls</b> “discard too much variation to find any significant effects” (p. 22). This assertion is incorrect; in NSW, we did not focus on the loss of precision. Rather, after testing the restrictions entailed by their local estimators, we concluded that the evidence indicated that DLR (and ADR) were arbitrarily throwing away lots of valid identifying information and potentially focusing on variation that generated biased estimates. It is the case, however, that in longer-term dynamic models, loss of precision is an issue as well, as we note in this paper.|$|R

40|$|The role {{of spatial}} {{variability}} in water inputs on runoff dynamics has generally not received as much research attention as topography and soils; however, {{the influence of}} topography and forest cover on snow surface energy exchanges can result in asynchronous snowmelt throughout a catchment, complicating the space–time patterns of runoff generation. This study investigates temporal variation in {{the relative importance of}} <b>spatial</b> <b>controls</b> on the occurrence, duration, and timing of shallow groundwater response, utilizing a highly distributed monitoring network in a snowmelt-dominated montane catchment in western Canada. The study findings indicate that deep-soil hydraulic conductivity is a first-order <b>control</b> on the <b>spatial</b> distribution of sites that generate shallow groundwater response versus sites that experience only deep percolation. Upslope contributing area and slope gradient are first-order controls on the duration of groundwater response during peak-flow, recession-flow, and low-flow periods. Shallow runoff response areas expand and contract throughout these periods and follow the general spatial patterns of topographic convergence. However, <b>spatial</b> <b>controls</b> on the timing, intensity, and quantity of snowmelt and controls on vertical versus lateral flux partitioning in the soil overwhelm the influence of topographic convergence on runoff patterns during early spring freshet periods. The study findings suggest that various topographic indices and topography-based rainfall runoff models would not likely be good predictors of runoff patterns in snowmelt-dominated montane catchments during early phases of the spring freshet, but would increase in importance as the freshet and post-freshet periods proceed...|$|R

50|$|Stigmergy {{has even}} been {{observed}} in bacteria, various species of which differentiate into distinct cell types and which participate in group behaviors that are guided by sophisticated temporal and <b>spatial</b> <b>control</b> systems. Spectacular examples of multicellular behavior can be found among the myxobacteria. Myxobacteria travel in swarms containing many cells kept together by intercellular molecular signals. Most myxobacteria are predatory: individuals benefit from aggregation as it allows accumulation of extracellular enzymes which are used to digest prey microorganisms. When nutrients are scarce, myxobacterial cells aggregate into fruiting bodies, within which the swarming cells transform themselves into dormant myxospores with thick cell walls. The fruiting process is thought to benefit myxobacteria by ensuring that cell growth is resumed with a group (swarm) of myxobacteria, rather than isolated cells. Similar life cycles have developed among the cellular slime molds. The best known of the myxobacteria, Myxococcus xanthus and Stigmatella aurantiaca, are studied in various laboratories as prokaryotic models of development.|$|E

Manipulating cell seeding density {{is a common}} biological technique in controlling cell-cell interactions, but controlling local density is difficult and {{it is often difficult}} to decouple effects between soluble signals in the medium and physical cell-cell interactions. Micropatterning of cell adhesion proteins can be used in defining the spatial positions of different cells on a substrate to study human ESC proliferation. Seeding stem cells into PDMS microwells and flipping them onto a substrate or another cell layer is a method of achieving precise <b>spatial</b> <b>control.</b> Gap junction communications has also been studied using microfluidics whereby negative pressure generated by fluid flow in side channels flanking a central channel traps pairs of cells that are in direct contact or separated by a small gap.

50|$|Due to the {{pronounced}} resolution {{activity of}} Cre, {{one of its}} initial applications was the excision of loxP-flanked ("floxed") genes leading to cell-specific gene knockout of such a floxed gene after Cre becomes expressed in the tissue of interest. Current technologies incorporate methods, which allow for both the spatial and temporal control of Cre activity. A common method facilitating the <b>spatial</b> <b>control</b> of genetic alteration involves {{the selection of a}} tissue-specific promoter to drive Cre expression. Placement of Cre under control of such a promoter results in localized, tissue-specific expression. As an example, Leone et al. have placed the transcription unit {{under the control of the}} regulatory sequences of the myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) gene, leading to induced removal of targeted gene sequences in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. The specific DNA fragment recognized by Cre remains intact in cells, which do not express the PLP gene; this in turn facilitates empirical observation of the localized effects of genome alterations in the myelin sheath that surround nerve fibers in the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Selective Cre expression has been achieved in many other cell types and tissues as well.|$|E
