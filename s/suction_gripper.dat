Paper introduces the overview, functions and industrial applications {{of this type}} of robot. The R 12 articulated robot motion resembles human arm with 5 degrees of freedom having 5 joints. This robot operates with point to point motion and continuous motion. The R 12 Robot can carry a maximum effective payload of 1 kg at the centre of gravity of the end effectors.

40|$|A {{microassembly}} {{station for}} mounting MEMS components on a flexible substrate was developed. The core components are a micro hotplate {{mounted on a}} xy stage and a <b>suction</b> <b>gripper</b> with an integrated force sensor carried by a nanoslider (1 DOF in z-Axis). A syringe with a 30 gauge needle, mounted on a PC controllable 3 DOF micromanipulator, is driven by a microdispenser. Two micro cameras allow a precise alignment of the sensor on the substrate. The whole set up is PC controlled under Labview 8. 5 /National Instruments/. The station allows processing of soldering paste, conductive glues and anisotropic conductive tape. Bonding trials with solder paste and conductive glues failed. The 3 M Film 5552 R showed best performances with low resistance electrical connections and with a reliable mechanical bondings. Contact resistances below 0. 5 Ω were achieved. Additionally the overall process time is very low in comparison to other processes...|$|E

The research is still in full progress, especially as the robots need to be carefully designed so that they do not bruise the fruit while picking.

40|$|Assembly is {{a crucial}} part in the {{realization}} of a product. Compared to assembly in the macro world, assembly in the micro world is influenced by scaling effects. These include surface forces, high requirements on placement uncertainty and small product dimensions. Conventional high-speed assembly in many cases utilizes <b>suction</b> <b>grippers.</b> However, their large moving mass results in high collision forces during product placement. Therefore, they are unsuitable for assembling micro products. This paper will discuss problems during assembly in the micro world {{with an emphasis on}} forces during the assembly process. A new design is proposed for a gripper with a moving mass less than 1 g for a pick up needle with a 6 mm diameter. In the design friction and hysteresis are neglectable. The paper focus is on gripper design, realization and experimental results. cop. 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A {{robotic system}} is {{developed}} to automate the packing of polycrystalline silicon nuggets into a fragile fused silica crucible in CZ semiconductor wafer production. The highly irregular {{shapes of the}} nuggets make this a difficult and challenging task. In this system, nugget grasping is done with a three-cup <b>suction</b> <b>gripper</b> and nugget manipulation is attained with a 7 DOF SCARA manipulator. An optical 3 -D vision system, based on active laser triangulation, measures nugget and crucible profiles. A model-free Virtual Trial and Error packing algorithm determines optimal nugget placement in real time. A hybrid position-force control scheme has been implemented and tested for physical nugget placement.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{grasping}} system and design approach behind Cartman, the winning entrant in the 2017 Amazon Robotics Challenge. We investigate the design processes {{leading up to}} the final iteration of the system and describe the emergent solution by comparing it with key robotics design aspects. Following our experience, we propose a new design aspect, precision vs. redundancy, that should be considered alongside the previously proposed design aspects of modularity vs. integration, generality vs. assumptions, computation vs. embodiment and planning vs. feedback. We present the grasping system behind Cartman, the winning robot in the 2017 Amazon Robotics Challenge. The system makes strong use of redundancy in design by implementing complimentary tools, a <b>suction</b> <b>gripper</b> and a parallel gripper. This multi-modal end-effector is combined with three grasp synthesis algorithms to accommodate the range of objects provided by Amazon during the challenge. We provide a detailed system description and an evaluation of its performance before discussing the broader nature of the system with respect to the key aspects of robotic design as initially proposed by the winners of the first Amazon Picking Challenge. To address the principal nature of our grasping system and the reason for its success, we propose an additional robotic design aspect `precision vs. redundancy'.

40|$|Manual {{palpation}} {{is commonly}} used to localize tumors and other features buried deep inside organs during open surgery. This approach is not feasible in minimally invasive or robotic surgery, as the contact with the tissue is mediated by instruments. To address this problem, we propose a soft robotic skin (SRS) that can be deployed from a small incision and create a stiffness map in a single step. Such a skin is composed of a matrix of soft robotic tactile elements (SRTEs), each one able to expand and record the tissue response during expansion. In this paper, we firstly prove the feasibility of palpation using a single SRTE. Then, we present and test a soft-suction based anchoring mechanism {{able to keep the}} SRS in the desired position in contact with the tissue, allowing surgeons to palpate different sides of the organ. Finally, we detail a calibration method for the SRTE, and assess the feasibility of identifying lumps buried inside a soft tissue phantom, and then inside a chicken liver during an ex-vivo trial. Experimental results show that the SRTE was able to differentiate simulated lumps (up to 3. 25 mm deep) from healthy tissue in both the phantom and the ex-vivo trials. These results, added to the ability of the <b>suction</b> <b>gripper</b> to compensate for the expansion forces of each SRTE, are paving the way for soft robotic autonomous tools {{that can be used for}} intraoperative mapping of tissue cancers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{handling}} of air-permeable semi-finished products in particular for textiles is often done by low-pressure <b>suction</b> <b>grippers.</b> These grippers create a slight vacuum {{at a large}} suction rate. A disadvantage {{of this type of}} gripper is the huge energy demand required for vacuum generation. One {{reason for this is that}} the gripping elements operate by default with the maximum possible suction power to compensate suddenly occurring disturbances and ensure a safe transport of the semi-finished products. To minimize the required energy consumption, a new approach was developed. Each gripping element is continuously monitored by sensors. In a control loop these information are used to adjust the suction power by a valve. Thus, the suction power is decreased if there are no disturbances and is abruptly increased when disturbances occur. This procedure allows a resource efficient handling by reducing the average suction power and thus the energy consumption by more than 50 %...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{complete}} study of automatizing the manipulation process of tanned natural leather plies is presented. The considered leather plies are partially refined and their surface {{is suitable for}} grasping by <b>suction</b> <b>grippers.</b> The particular features (non-rigid structure, irregular shape and size, etc.) of such a material make the handling and loading on the workstations very critical and difficult to be approached. To increase the reliability of grasping, the development of customized vacuum cups seems to be advisable. In the paper, an innovative vacuum cup model is proposed. Its performances are quantitatively compared with a other models by means of appropriate measuring methods. Another problem concerning the automatic manipulation of leather plies is to avoid the grasping {{of more than one}} ply at a time, due to the irregularity of the ply profile. A device able to solve this problem, using an innovative equipment for moving the entire stack from the store to the workstation and for separating the plies, is also shown and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Fundamental {{to many of}} NASA's in-space {{transportation}} missions is {{the capture}} and handling of various objects and vehicles in various orbits for servicing, debris disposal, sample retrieval, and assembly {{without the benefit of}} sufficient grapple fixtures and docking ports. To perform similar material handling tasks on Earth, pincher <b>grippers,</b> <b>suction</b> <b>grippers,</b> or magnetic chucks are used, but are unable to reliably grip aluminum and composite spacecraft, insulation, radiators, solar arrays, or extra-terrestrial objects in the vacuum of outer space without dedicated handles in the right places. The electronic Flexible Electrostatic Technologies for space Capture and Handling (FETCH) will enable reliable and compliant gripping (soft dock) of practically any object in various orbits or surfaces without dedicated mechanical features, very low impact capture, and built-in proximity sensing without any conventional actuators. Originally developed to handle semiconductor and glass wafers during vacuum chamber processing without contamination, the normal rigid wafer handling chucks are replaced with thin metal foil segments laminated in flexible insulation driven by commercial off-the-shelf solid state, high-voltage power supplies. Preliminary testing in NASA Marshall Space Flight Center's (MSFC's) Flat Floor Robotics Lab demonstrated compliant alignment and gripping with a full-sized, 150 -lb microsat mockup and translation before a clean release with a flip of a switch. The flexible electrostatic gripper pads can be adapted to various space applications with different sizes, shapes, and foil electrode layouts even with openings through the gripper pads for addition of guidance sensors or injection of permanent adhesives. With gripping forces estimated between 0. 5 and 2. 5 lb/in 2 or 70 - 300 lb/ft 2 of surface contact, the FETCH can turn on and off rapidly and repeatedly to enable sample handling, soft docking, in-space assembly, precision relocation, and surface translation for accurate anchoring...|$|R
40|$|Suction-based end effectors {{are widely}} used in {{industry}} and are often preferred over parallel-jaw and multifinger grippers due {{to their ability to}} lift objects with a single point of contact. This ability simplifies planning, and hand-coded heuristics such as targeting planar surfaces are often used to select suction grasps based on point cloud data. In this paper, we propose a compliant suction contact model that computes the quality of the seal between the suction cup and target object and determines whether or not the suction grasp can resist an external wrench (e. g. gravity) on the object. To evaluate a grasp, we measure robustness to perturbations in end-effector and object pose, material properties, and external wrenches. We use this model to generate Dex-Net 3. 0, a dataset of 2. 8 million point clouds, suction grasps, and grasp robustness labels computed with 1, 500 3 D object models and we train a Grasp Quality Convolutional Neural Network (GQ-CNN) on this dataset to classify suction grasp robustness from point clouds. We evaluate the resulting system in 375 physical trials on an ABB YuMi fitted with a pneumatic <b>suction</b> <b>gripper.</b> When the object shape, pose, and mass properties are known, the model achieves 99 % precision on a dataset of objects with Adversarial geometry such as sharply curved surfaces. Furthermore, a GQ-CNN-based policy trained on Dex-Net 3. 0 achieves 99 % and 97 % precision respectively on a dataset of Basic and Typical objects.
