Starting in season 2, the $15,000 question has two or all three answers being correct, and the team must <b>select</b> <b>all</b> of the correct answers, and only the correct answers; the $25,000 question requires the team to rank the three answers in the correct order.|$|E
5|$|Free updates to {{the game}} were {{released}} to provide fixes and updates {{to the game}}, some based on community feedback. These included: a Big Head mode, which makes all characters in the game have disproportionate heads; a photo mode, which allows players to edit photos taken during gameplay; {{the ability to use}} the original voice cast, with localized subtitles; and updates to the game's AR challenges. These included the ability to <b>select</b> <b>all</b> playable characters from the game and its downloadable content (DLC) to be used in all combat and predator challenge maps. Previously, each map had predefined character selection; the addition of a harder difficulty setting on combat challenges; more round-based challenges as well as interior map locations; and the removal of the blue wall around the challenges, which players found distracting.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{possible to find}} a single character indexed under multiple radicals. [...] For example, many dictionaries list 義 under either 羊 or 戈 (the radical of its lower part 我). [...] Furthermore, with digital dictionaries, {{it is now possible}} to search for characters by cross-reference. Using this [...] "multi-component method" [...] a relatively new development enabled by computing technology, the user can <b>select</b> <b>all</b> of a character's components from a table and the computer will present a list of matching characters. This eliminates the guesswork of choosing the correct radical and calculating the correct stroke count, and cuts down searching time significantly. [...] One can query for characters containing both 羊 and 戈, and get back only five characters (羢, 義, 儀, 羬 and [...] 羲) to search through. The Academia Sinica’s 漢字構形資料庫 Chinese character structure database also works this way, returning only seven characters in this instance. [...] Harbaugh's Chinese Characters dictionary similarly allows searches based on any component. Some modern computer dictionaries allow the user to draw characters with a mouse, stylus or finger, ideally tolerating a degree of imperfection, thus eliminating the problem of radical identification altogether.|$|E

2500|$|On his return, Sunderland {{formally}} {{reverted to}} Anglicanism, taking the oaths in April 1691 and quietly recommenced {{sitting in the}} House of Lords. In May William {{paid a visit to}} him at his home in Althorp, Northamptonshire, to discuss public affairs. Over the next years the King frequently visited him and gave him confidence, but Sunderland did not dare to fully enter public life until September 1693, when he took a house in the city. He repeatedly advised the King to <b>select</b> <b>all</b> of his ministers from one political party, and eventually effected a reconciliation between William and his sister-in-law, the later Queen Anne. He was an influential adviser, inducing William to accept only Whigs in his government. William, never vindictive, was untroubled by Sunderland's past services to James, who had {{made it very clear that}} Sunderland was the one man he would never forgive, though he had made tentative advances towards the fallen King. Most of William's servants had at sometime betrayed him, and he valued Sunderland for his frankness and ability to voice unwelcome truths. It has been suggested that Sunderland's notorious rudeness actually appealed to the King, who detested flattery and could himself be distinctly rude. Once when William said that, while the Whigs personally liked him better than the Tories, the Tories were better friends to Monarchy, Sunderland shrewdly replied: [...] "but you must consider that you are not their Monarch". He even wrote a letter telling the King that if his Ministers were not fit for his service, it was his own fault for not choosing better men.|$|E
