40|$|AbstractBackgroundA {{history of}} 3 or more concussions is {{frequently}} associated with numerous short- and long-term neuropathologies. Impairments in postural control are a known acute consequence of concussion; however, limited evidence {{exists on the}} effects of multiple concussions on gait. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess gait <b>stepping</b> <b>characteristics</b> in collegiate aged student-athletes based on concussion history. MethodsThere were 63 participants divided into 3 even groups based on concussion history: ≥ 3 concussions, 1 – 2 concussions, and 0 concussion. All participants completed 10 trials of gait on a 4. 9 [*]m instrumented walkway. The dependent variables of interest included both gait <b>stepping</b> <b>characteristics</b> (<b>step</b> velocity, length, and width, double support time, and the percentage of the gait cycle in stance) and coefficient of variability (CoV) measures (step length, time, and width). The gait <b>stepping</b> <b>characteristics</b> were compared first with a MANOVA with follow-up 1 -way ANOVAs and Tukey post hoc tests as appropriate. The CoV measures were compared with 1 -way ANOVAs and Tukey post hoc tests. ResultsThere were main effects for group for step velocity, length, width, and double support time. Overall, the 0 concussion group displayed typical healthy young gait parameters and performed significantly better than either concussion group. The 0 concussion group had a significantly greater step length CoV, but there were no differences in the step time or width CoV. ConclusionThis finding provides evidence of subtle impairments in postural control during gait among individuals with prior history of concussion which could be an early indicator of future neurological deficiencies. The limited difference in the variability measures is consistent with prior static stance studies and could suggest the individuals constrain their motor systems to reduce variability. Taken together, these findings suggest a conservative gait strategy which is adopted by individuals with a history of concussions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFalls {{leading to}} {{disability}} are common occurrences with advancing age. Stepping {{is a natural}} protective option for maintaining balance and preventing falls. There are directionally dependent challenges for protective stepping associated with falls among older individuals. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the stepping response patterns evoked by different directions of externally applied postural disturbances in younger and older adults and in relation to falls. Seventy-five community-dwelling adults were tested: 26 younger adults and 49 older adults. Fall history of older participants was tracked prospectively for 1 year after testing. Steps were randomly evoked in 12 directions by a motorized waist-pull system. The number of recovery steps, type of stepping strategy, and first <b>step</b> kinematic <b>characteristics</b> were determined. Younger participants mainly used single recovery steps regardless of the perturbation direction. For the older groups, multiple steps occurred predominantly and were least for the forwardbackward directions and greatest for the lateral directions. Trials with three or more recovery steps were increased laterally only for the fallers. Overall, fallers initiated stepping earliest, but other <b>stepping</b> <b>characteristics</b> were similar between the groups for forwardbackward perturbations. Aging differences in stepping strategies for diagonal and lateral perturbations included numerous interlimb collisions. Adaptive changes in <b>stepping</b> <b>characteristics</b> between forward and lateral perturbations were also observed in relation to age and risk of falls. These results indicated an age-associated reduction in balance recovery effectiveness through stepping particularly for the lateral direction among older individuals at greater risk for falls...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the <b>step</b> <b>characteristics</b> during the {{acceleration}} phase (0 — 30 m) of a 100 -m sprint with reference to the step-type of sprinters. 59 male collegiate sprinters (season best time: 10. 68 ± 0. 22 s) were recorded running in 100 -m races using 10 high-speed video cameras (300 fps). The step variables, such as step-frequency (SF), step-length (SL), contact time, and flight time of each step in the acceleration phase (0 — 30 m) and maximum speed phase (30 — 60 m) were calculated. Cluster analysis was used to classify the subjects according to step-type as indicators for the ratio of SF and SL in the 30 — 60 m section. In addition, each of the step-type groups was divided into two sub-groups (good and poor sprinters) according to the mean speed in the 30 — 60 m section. The main results were as follows: (1) Sprinters were classifiable into 3 step-type groups; SL-type (n= 22), SF-type (n= 24), and Mid-type (n= 13). (2) Among these groups, there were no differences in the 100 -m race times and mean speeds during the 0 — 30, 30 — 60, and 60 — 100 m sections, although SL-type sprinters were taller and had a higher SLindex than SF-type sprinters. SF-type sprinters took a larger numbers of steps over the 100 -m distance and showed a higher SFindex than SL-type and Mid-type sprinters. (3) In the 0 — 30 m and 30 — 60 m sections, the contact and flight times of SL-type sprinters were longer than those of SF-type sprinters. (4) In SL-type sprinters, the SF of good sprinters was higher than that of poor sprinters at the 5 th step, and the SL of good sprinters was longer than that of poor sprinters from the 7 th to 15 th steps, and in the 30 — 60 m section. (5) SF-type sprinters showed no significant differences in the SL, but the SF of good sprinters was higher than that of poor sprinters from the 7 th to 16 th steps and in the 30 — 60 m section. These results indicate that there are differences in <b>step</b> <b>characteristics</b> during the acceleration phase according to step-type, and that the <b>step</b> <b>characteristics</b> during the acceleration phase may affect the acceleration ability needed to develop a maximum sprint speed.

40|$|Cytoplasmic dynein is a dimeric motor that {{transports}} intracellular cargoes {{towards the}} minus end of microtubules (MTs). In contrast to other processive motors, stepping of the dynein motor domains (heads) is not precisely coordinated. Therefore, {{the mechanism of}} dynein processivity remains unclear. Here, by engineering the mechanical and catalytic properties of the motor, we show that dynein processivity minimally requires a single active head and a second inert MT-binding domain. Processivity arises from a high ratio of MT-bound to unbound time, and not from interhead communication. In addition, nucleotide-dependent microtubule release is gated by tension on the linker domain. Intramolecular tension sensing is observed in dynein’s stepping motion at high interhead separations.
