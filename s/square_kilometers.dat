5|$|Metis has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 60×40×34km across, {{which makes it}} the second smallest of the four inner satellites of Jupiter.

The bulk composition and mass of Metis are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea (~0.86g/cm3), its mass can be estimated as ~3.6×1016kg. This density would imply that it is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%.|$|E
