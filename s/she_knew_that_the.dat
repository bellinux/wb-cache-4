5|$|When {{they are}} young, Sam breaks into the orphanage {{he was thrown}} out of to get to Nathan, and tell him some grim news. To make up for the bad part, Sam leads Nathan to the house of Evelyn,a {{historian}} who was legally sold their mother's belongings. They attempt to retrieve the items, but are caught. Evelyn called the police before <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boys were the offspring of Cassandra Morgan, an employee of hers. Evelyn collapses from her lung disease and the boys are associated with her death. They flee, and Sam prompts Nathan that they can become explorers, under the new surname of Drake. It is implied that Sam , around 19 or 20 years old was behind bars when Nathan around 14 or 15 years old stole Francis Drake's ring in Columbia, and when he first partnered with Victor Sullivan, he presumably later met Victor but never saw him eye to eye, and distrusted him.|$|E
500|$|This was the [...] "dramatic {{high point}} of the most {{analyzed}} event of the free grace controversy", wrote historian Michael Winship. [...] Historians have given {{a variety of reasons}} for this seemingly impulsive statement, including an [...] "exultant impulse", [...] "hysteria", [...] "cracking under the strain of the inquest", and being [...] "possessed of the Spirit". [...] Winship, citing the work of historian Mary Beth Norton, suggests that Hutchinson consciously decided to explain why <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> divines of the colony were not able ministers of the New Testament. [...] This was [...] "not histrionics, but pedagogy," [...] according to Winship; it was Hutchinson's attempt to teach the Court, and doing so was consistent with her character.|$|E
500|$|Park County sheriff Fred Wegener (whose son was in {{the school}} {{building}} {{at the time of}} the incident) informed the media that all seven girls were molested, though he did not know [...] "how much or to what degree." [...] Lynna Long, a 15-year-old [...] and one of the seven hostages, stated that Morrison lined the girls up facing a chalkboard and then sexually assaulted all of them; Long stated that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other hostages were being molested because of [...] "the rustling of clothes and elastic being snapped and zippers being opened and closed." [...] During the sexual assaults, Morrison reportedly held his gun to the hostages' heads and threatened to kill them if they did not cooperate. According to the first hostage released, Morrison would systematically take individual hostages from the blackboard and further into the interior of the classroom before sexually assaulting them.|$|E
5000|$|The sender's {{strategy}} is: {{a friend}} {{does not give}} and an enemy gives. The receiver's beliefs are updated accordingly: if she receives a gift <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sender is a enemy, otherwise <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sender is a friend. The receiver's strategy is: reject. Again, this is NOT an equilibrium, since the sender's strategy is not optimal: an enemy sender can increase his payoff from -1 to 0 by not sending a gift.|$|R

The child may not like the medicine, but the mother does it only because she cares for the child. The alcoholics were punished so that their families would not be destroyed.|$|R

50|$|This was {{the main}} {{intuitive}} observation of Stiglitz and Weiss. They realised that an individual that is willing to accept a higher interest rate in her loan is doing so because <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> riskiness of her project is such that there is lower probability of repaying the loan. In a limited liability setting, where the personal assets of the borrower might not be taken as collateral, the borrower might not object to paying a high enough interest rate, as <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> probability of the project succeeding is low, so probability of repayment is low. Even if the project does succeed, the returns will be high enough for a profit to be left after repaying the loan. The safe borrowers have a high probability of repaying their loan, so even a modest interest rate, relative to their expected return, is {{likely to result in}} an unprofitable contract.|$|R

60|$|Meantime the Chief Lady Guest, {{known to}} be in {{suffrage}} work, was pinching up her lips and getting her phrases ready, like a harpooner waiting to strike. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hostess meant this as an opening for her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{safety of}} {{morality}} lies neither in {{the adoption of}} this or that philosophical speculation, or this or that theological creed, but in a real and living belief in that fixed order of nature which sends social disorganisation upon the track of immorality, as surely as it sends physical disease after physical trespasses.
