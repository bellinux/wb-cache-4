40|$|Fresh {{apricot pulp}} and its <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> (bar, chutney, and leather) were {{analyzed}} for physicochemical (moisture content, titrable acidity (TA), ascorbic acid, and percent reducing sugars) and antioxidant properties (2, 2 -diphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), reducing power, total phenolics, lipid peroxidation, ferric reducing antioxidant potential, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity). Reducing sugars, TA, and ascorbic acid content {{were found to}} be higher in the <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> than the fresh pulp. A significant difference in the antioxidant properties between the fresh apricot pulp and its <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> was observed. The difference in antioxidant properties between the fresh and the <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> may be attributed to the partial degradation of the bioactive compounds by the action of heat during processing. Among the <b>processed</b> <b>products,</b> apricot bar showed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity, lipid peroxidation, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity.

40|$|A {{chemical}} fingerprint {{method was}} developed for reorganizing and validating different <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> of Angelica using HPLC. About 11 common peaks of this HPLC fingerprints were found by assigning Ferulic acid peak as the reference peak. The correlation coefficient of entire chromatographic patterns among samples were calculated and the simulative mean chromatogram was calculated and generated using the Computer Aided Similarity Evaluation System, the observation indicated that the characteristic peaks of this HPLC fingerprints existed significant difference between different <b>processed</b> <b>products.</b> Data were evaluated statistically using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Discriminant Analysis (DA) in order to classify the samples and to identify key categorizing parameters. The statistical {{results showed that the}} projected plots of each <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> were localized in confined cluster in the 3 D-projection plots of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and that 55 representative samples were separated into 5 groups using HCA at a rescaled distance of 5 and the same <b>processed</b> <b>product</b> samples were clustered in the same cluster. Furthermore, Fish’s discriminant functions were generated using 6 selected predictor variables, the tested samples of different <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> were classified with 100 % accuracy and DA plots for the 5 groups were well-resolved. To the knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the feasibility and advantages of employing chromatographic fingerprinting combined with PCA, HCA and DA for the accurate identification and validation of different <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> of Angelica. The methodology {{can also be used to}} determine relationships between chemical composition and therapeutic effects and assess quality of different <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> of Angelica...|$|R

Domestic Support and Border Measures for <b>Processed</b> Horticultural <b>Products</b> In horticultural markets, trade barriers often apply to the <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> whereas domestic support applies to farm-produced raw commodities. Here we assess the effects of such trade barriers and domestic support by simulating the effects of policy reform on global processing tomato markets, which are faced with modest <b>processed</b> <b>product</b> tariffs and high domestic support in the European Union (EU). Both protection and EU subsidy drive down world welfare, but we find that reducing import tariffs for tomato products would yield greater effects on markets and larger welfare impacts outside Europe than would reductions in EU domestic support. Key words: agricultural trade policy, equilibrium displacement model, EU subsidies, horticulture, processing tomatoes, tariffs, welfare analysis, WTO negotiations.

40|$|Romania's {{international}} agrifood trade {{increased significantly}} {{during the last}} decade, and mostly after the EU accession. Since 1990, the Romanian agrifood trade balance showed an almost continuous increasing deficit trend until 2008. In four years only, the trend reversed and in 2013, {{for the first time}} in the last two and a half decades, the agrifood trade balance turned positive. The present paper is analyzing the evolution of the trade evolution and its structure, separating the agrifood products in three categories: agricultural commodities, primarily <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> and secondary <b>processed</b> <b>products.</b> A higher ratio of <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> in exports is indicating an increased competitiveness, resulting from higher unit values incorporating more added value, and showing, at the same time, a higher development degree of the country's food industry. The results for total trade show that the <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> represented at most 46 % of the Romanian exports, and at least 63 % of imports, indicating a low-competitive structure of the agrifood trade. The analysis is detailed for intra and extra-EU trade and by main partners and groups of products...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to examine the feeding effects of Angelica keiskei Koidz (AK) and its <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> on serum, liver, and body fat content and the expression of antioxidant genes in rats fed a high fat diet. AK and its <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> were added at 3 - 5 % to a high fat diet and fed to adult rats for 6 weeks. In experiment 1 (EXP 1), the rats were fed with one of six diets including a control diet (normal fat), high fat diet (HF), and HF + AK additives groups (four groups). In experiment 2 (EXP 2), the rats were separated into three groups of HF, HF + AK whole leaves, and HF + fermented juice (FS) + squeeze (SA). Body weight was not different among the groups in either experiment. The liver weight was lower in the FS and SA groups compared {{to that in the}} other groups (P < 0. 05).
