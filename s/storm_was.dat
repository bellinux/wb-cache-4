40|$|We {{find that}} during the dusty season on Mars (southern spring and summer) of years without a global dust <b>storm</b> there <b>are</b> three large regional-scale dust <b>storms.</b> The <b>storms</b> <b>are</b> labeled A, B, and C in {{seasonal}} order. This classification is based on examining the zonal mean 50 Pa (approximately 25 km) daytime temperature retrievals from TES/MGS and MCS/MRO over 6 Mars Years. Regional-scale <b>storms</b> <b>are</b> defined as events where the temperature exceeds 200 K. Examining the MCS dust field at 50 Pa indicates that warming in the Southern Hemisphere is dominated by direct heating, while northern high latitude warming is a dynamical response. A <b>storms</b> <b>are</b> springtime planet encircling Southern Hemisphere events. B <b>storms</b> <b>are</b> southern polar events that begin near perihelion and last through the solstice. C <b>storms</b> <b>are</b> southern summertime events starting well {{after the end of}} the B storm. C storms show the most interannual variability...|$|R

5|$|Offshore Virginia, swells {{generated}} by the storm stranded a tugboat and injured two people. Waves along the coast also caused beach erosion, especially in Virginia and North Carolina. Inland, effects were minor and generally limited to mostly light rainfall. More than 100campers on the Outer Banks of North Carolina were forced to evacuate due to flooding on North Carolina Highway 12. Although near-hurricane-force wind gusts pelted coastal areas of Virginia and North Carolina, wind damage from the <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> minimal. The remnants of the storm brought rainfall to portions of New England, especially to Connecticut, where precipitation from the storm peaked at 4.62in (117mm).

5|$|On October 10, as the {{precursor}} extratropical <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> forming, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a gale {{and later a}} storm warning for the island, expecting winds of 50 to 60mph (60 to 95km/h). Several radio interviews and television stations issued information on the expected storm. Many residents believed they were insufficiently warned, though it is acknowledged that emergency managers and citizens pay less attention to gale warnings then they do for tropical cyclone warnings. On October 12, as the <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> passing {{to the south of}} the island, officials closed all schools and government offices. Many private businesses closed as well.|$|E

In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn's equator that was not present during the Voyager encounters, and in 1994 another smaller <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> observed. The 1990 <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> {{an example of a}} Great White Spot, a unique but short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year, roughly every 30 Earth years, {{around the time of the}} northern hemisphere's summer solstice. Previous Great White Spots were observed in 1876, 1903, 1933 and 1960, with the 1933 storm being the most famous. If the periodicity is maintained, another storm will occur in about 2020.|$|E

5|$|The 1994–95 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} fairly active, with storms forming {{regularly}} from October through April. It {{was much less}} damaging than its predecessor, {{and most of the}} storms in the season remained over water or only brushed land. The first system was Tropical Depression A1, which formed in October and passed north of Madagascar. The first named <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> Albertine, which formed on November23 in the northeastern portion of the basin and became one of three intense tropical cyclones. The last <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> Marlene, which was also an intense tropical cyclone and dissipated on April11.|$|E
5|$|The 2005 Azores {{subtropical}} <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> the 19th nameable {{storm of}} the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It was not officially {{named by the}} US National Hurricane Center as it was operationally classified as a non-tropical low. The storm developed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean out of a low-pressure area that gained subtropical characteristics on October4. The <b>storm</b> <b>was</b> short-lived, crossing over the Azores later on October4 before becoming extratropical again on October5. Neither damages nor fatalities were reported during that time.
