25|$|The {{scheduling}} of Panorama has, {{since the}} 1980s, often been {{a subject of}} media debate and controversy, due to {{the duties of the}} BBC to provide both on the one hand entertaining programming that appeals to a mass audience, and on the other serious journalism that might have a narrower audience. In February 1985, with the programme being watched by an average audience of just 3.5million viewers, Controller of BBC One Michael Grade moved the programme from its traditional prime time 8.10pm slot on Monday evenings back to 9.30pm, after the Nine O'Clock News. Despite many protests about this move in the media, Panorama remained in this slot until 1997, although two of Grade's successors, Alan Yenotob and Michael Jackson, were known to be unhappy about running 70 continuous minutes of news from 9pm. In May 1997 the Acting Controller of BBC One, Mark Thompson, did move Panorama back half an hour to 10pm, {{to make way for the}} sitcom Birds of a Feather, which opened the BBC to criticism that it was <b>side-lining</b> serious content in favour of lighter programming.|$|E

Stack rated all of the songs a [...] "B" [...] grade or higher, and gave [...] "Time Warp" [...] the highest grade of an [...] "A+". He called it his favorite moment of the episode, and praised its energy; he wrote that Quinn made a [...] "surprisingly good" [...] Magenta. Semigran also praised the number, and commended the performances by Morris, Monteith, Agron and particularly Colfer, who, she wrote, [...] "looked and sounded the part so well, you'd swear you were watching the original Rocky Horror Picture Show". In a generally negative review of the episode, Reiter commented that despite her dissatisfaction, she found herself singing along to [...] "Time Warp" [...] with [...] "disconcerting enthusiasm", and was [...] "nostalgically transported against [...] better judgment". In contrast, VanDerWerff stated {{that he would have}} increased his review of the episode from an [...] "F" [...] to a [...] "D" [...] had [...] "Time Warp" [...] been better, as he had [...] "never seen a more lifeless version". Zoller Seitz similarly called it [...] "very possibly the weakest, most uninspired rendition" [...] he had ever seen, and criticized the <b>side-lining</b> of Colfer in favor of Monteith.|$|E

500|$|The {{regicide}} of al-Amin soured al-Ma'mun's victory. Tahir {{was soon}} transferred {{out of the}} public eye to an unimportant post in Raqqa, but his deed lastingly tarnished the prestige and image of the Abbasid dynasty. According to Elton Daniel, [...] "It shattered the sacrosanct aura which had surrounded the person of the Abbasid caliphs; For the first time, an Abbasid ruler had been humiliated and put to death by rebellious subjects". As al-Ma'mun remained in Marv and made no signs of returning to the caliphal capital, a wave of Arab antipathy towards al-Ma'mun and his [...] "Persian" [...] supporters came to the fore in the western regions of the Caliphate, particularly in Baghdad and surroundings, which feared being degraded to a mere province. This was furthered when the new Caliph entrusted the governance of the state to Fadl ibn Sahl, who intended to permanently move the Muslim world's centre of power eastwards to Khurasan, where he and his circle could control the reins of power to the exclusion of other groups. Fadl was also responsible for <b>side-lining</b> many other supporters of al-Ma'mun; thus, when Harthama ibn A'yan went to Marv to inform al-Ma'mun of the real situation in the west, the Sahlids turned the Caliph against him and he was executed on charges of treason in June 816. In response, Harthama's son Hatim led a short-lived revolt in Armenia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mutilation}} {{of political}} rivals by the emperor was deemed {{an effective way}} of <b>side-lining</b> from the line of succession {{a person who was}} seen as a threat. Castrated men were not seen as a threat, as no matter how much power they gained they could never take the throne, and numerous eunuchs were entrusted with high and confidential offices in the Byzantine court and administration. In Byzantine culture, the emperor was a reflection of heavenly authority. Since God was perfect, the emperor also had to be unblemished; any mutilation, especially facial wounds, would disqualify an individual from taking the throne. An exception was Justinian II [...] (ὁ Ῥινότμητος, [...] "the slit-nosed"), who had his nose cut off (Greek - rhinokopia) when he was overthrown in 695 but was able to become emperor again, in 705.|$|E
2500|$|Abbas needed {{ten years}} to get his army into shape {{so that he could}} {{effectively}} confront his Ottoman and Uzbek enemies. During this period, the Uzbeks and the Ottomans took swaths of territory from Iran. [...] He also used military reorganisation as another way of <b>side-lining</b> the Qizilbash. [...] He created a standing army of many thousands of ghulams (always conscripted from ethnic Georgians and Circassians), and to a much lesser extent Iranians, to fight alongside the traditional, feudal force provided by the Qizilbash. The new army regiments' loyalty was to the Shah. The new army consisted of 10,000 to 15,000 cavalry or squires (conscripted Caucasian ghulams) armed with muskets and other weapons (then the largest cavalry in the world), a corps of musketeers, or tufangchiyan, (12,000 strong) and a corp of artillery, called tupchiyan (also 12,000 strong). In addition Abbas had a personal bodyguard, composed of Caucasian ghulams, that was increased to 3,000. This force amounted to about 40,000 soldiers paid for and beholden to the Shah.|$|E

50|$|Under the new system, {{the country}} was divided into 45 electoral districts, again {{providing}} disproportionate influence to rural East Bank communities while <b>side-lining</b> urban and Palestinian areas. Voting was held under a single non-transferable vote rule, where each voter has one vote even in multi-member districts. This weakened political parties as if they competed in multi-member districts with multiple candidates they risked diluting their vote between candidates and thus not winning any seats, whereas restricting the number of candidates they ran meant restricting {{the total number of}} seats they could possibly win. Political parties were also weak due to low membership, caused by public fear of discrimination against party members.|$|E
