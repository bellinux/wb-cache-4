It is most likely that the timber with small MFA exhibited high MOE, large tangential shrinkage, and small longitudinal shrinkage [6, 7], and that this caused more <b>surface</b> <b>checks</b> and less bow.|$|R
30|$|The {{difference}} in <b>surface</b> <b>checking</b> among the samples {{in this study}} might {{be explained by the}} {{difference in}} the HWP. When all the samples were included, the HWP exhibited the highest correlations with the TLSC and NSC among the wood properties examined. In the timber that contained sapwood on the outside, the drying stress would be large between the dry sapwood at the surface and the wet heartwood on the inside. The larger dimension timber contained more sapwood and had more prominent <b>surface</b> <b>checking</b> for B 1, B 4, and R 4. For R 1, both the small- and large-dimension timbers were mostly occupied with the heartwood and exhibited similar levels of <b>surface</b> <b>checking.</b> The R 1140 timber had sapwood only at the corners (HWP was 94  %), which might not have affected the drying stress between the corners. When <b>surface</b> <b>checking</b> was compared between source heights, timber 4 contained more sapwood and exhibited more prominent <b>surface</b> <b>checking</b> than timber 1, except that R 480 was occupied with the heartwood and exhibited similar level of <b>surface</b> <b>checking</b> with R 180.|$|R
30|$|The average {{lengths of}} the <b>surface</b> <b>checks</b> were longer {{for the larger}} {{dimension}} timber for all samples, except R 4. The maximum lengths of the <b>surface</b> <b>checks</b> were also longer for the larger dimension timber for all the samples.|$|R
30|$|The <b>surface</b> <b>check</b> {{occurs at}} the point where the drying stress exceeds the tensile strength. While the timber shrinks, the stress {{relaxation}} keeps the timber from splitting. Therefore, the tensile strength and the tensile creep in the tangential direction might affect the <b>surface</b> <b>check</b> [3]. Fujimoto et al. [16, 17] studied the effects of temperature or the moisture content on the shrinkage, drying stress, and creep compliance. Fujimoto et al. [17] showed that the creep compliance in radial compression creep tests decreased with distance from the pith, which suggested that not only the elasticity but also the viscosity might vary within the stem. If the difference in radius is related to the wood property characteristics of juvenile wood, the rheological properties in the tangential direction can be varied by the position within the stem or by cultivar.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{specific}} cases, kiln drying {{prior to}} preservative treatment is the prescribed method of utility pole seasoning in South Africa. The slow drying nature of Eucalyptus grandis poles makes rapid kiln drying potentially detrimen-tal due to development of defects such as excessive surface checking, honeycomb and collapse. To control these defects {{while maintaining the}} fastest drying rate possible, the effect of drying schedule on the drying quality of E. grandis poles was investigated. Full length pole drying was simulated in thirty 2. 1 m long butt sections of poles of which the top ends were end sealed. Three industrially used schedules that differed in dry and wet bulb temperature and duration of drying (Tdb, Twb and time) were chosen: 80 °C/ 59 °C/ 8 days, 80 °C/ 69 °C/ 10 days and 70 °C/ 59 °C/ 12 days. <b>Surface</b> <b>check</b> length of each pole was measured after drying.

30|$|Our {{previous}} study using 115 -mm dimension timber showed {{the effect of}} tangential shrinkage on the <b>surface</b> <b>checking</b> [8]. However, in this study {{the effect of the}} tangential shrinkage was observed only when the HWP was 100  %. The large variation of the HWP might have affected <b>surface</b> <b>checking</b> strongly. The transverse shrinkage ratio had no observed effect, as shown in our {{previous study}} [8].|$|R
30|$|The {{significant}} {{correlations between the}} <b>surface</b> <b>checking</b> and HWP for all the samples, and between the <b>surface</b> <b>checking</b> and MOE for timber with 100  % HWP suggested that the HWP and MOE could be useful indicators for sorting the timber that is susceptible to <b>surface</b> <b>checking.</b> The moisture content (MC) of the green wood has large variation within sugi, especially in the heartwood [20 – 22], and the initial MC of the timber before drying is highly correlated to the final MC of the timber after drying [30]. Therefore, to reduce the variation in the final MC of the timber, sorting the timber by the initial MC before drying is effective [30 – 32]. Nakashima [30] and Sugimori et al. [32] suggested that not only the initial MC, but also the heartwood proportion affected the final MC of the timber. Kawabe et al. [33] showed that the heartwood MC affected {{the distribution of the}} internal stresses and moisture content during drying. This study suggested that the heartwood proportion affected not only the drying speed and final MC, but also the <b>surface</b> <b>checking.</b>|$|R
30|$|The wood {{properties}} of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) vary within and among trees. In order to supply quality-controlled timber and decrease wood processing costs, {{it is expected}} that logs will be sorted by their wood properties and processed in suitable ways. Sugi trees were planted in large numbers during 1950 – 1970 in Japan, and thinned trees have been used as boxed-heart timber for poles and beams in housing construction. The boxed-heart timber, which is symmetrical about the pith, has little distortion by growth-stress release during sawing. However, it sometimes has bow and is susceptible to <b>surface</b> <b>checking</b> during drying. The drying of the timber proceeds from the surface and begins to shrink, while the interior can still be quite wet and not shrink. The shrinkage of the surface-layer is restricted by the inner layer, so tension drying stress is induced in the surface layer, while compression drying stress is induced in the inner layer. Tangential shrinkage is free at the corners of the timber, but is restricted between the corners owing to the shrinkage anisotropy between the tangential and radial directions, which induces large tension drying stress [1]. When the stress overcomes the tension strength of the timber, <b>surface</b> <b>checking</b> is induced. Recently, to shorten the drying time and prevent <b>surface</b> <b>checking,</b> various kiln-drying methods have been developed [2]. However, there is little information on why the drying defects such as bow and <b>surface</b> <b>checking</b> vary among timber that is dried together. The variations in the drying defects are considered to be induced by multiple wood-properties, which affect the water transportation, the deformation of the timber, and the <b>surface</b> <b>checking</b> occurrence and elongation. Therefore, the moisture content, density, shrinkage, and mechanical properties are suggested {{to be related to the}} bow and <b>surface</b> <b>checking</b> of the timber.|$|R
30|$|The {{difference}} in <b>surface</b> <b>check</b> along the stem {{is likely to}} be influenced by tangential shrinkage too. Our previous study [7] showed that tangential shrinkage was smaller {{at the bottom of the}} stem than at the upper part because of larger MFA. For aya-sugi, although timber 4 exhibited high HWP as timber 1, its total length of surface checks was longer than that of timber 1 (Fig.  2; Table  3). It might be because timber 4 exhibited larger tangential shrinkage than timber 1 (Table  2). On the other hand, the tangential/radial shrinkage ratio was smaller in timber 4 than in timber 1 for most cultivars. This result suggests that the shrinkage difference between tangential and radial direction is the fundamental reason causing surface checks in the boxed-heart timber; however, its effect on the surface-check variation is unclear.|$|E

30|$|The {{total length}} {{and the average}} length of the surface checks were longer at {{the upper part of the}} stem than the lower part (Fig.  2; Table  3). Katagiri et al. [10] also {{reported}} that the total length of surface checks was longer at the upper part of the stem than the lower part for two drying schedules. The difference between the source heights is most likely caused by the difference of HWP. As described in the introduction, when the drying proceeds from the outer part, drying stress occurs between the outer part, where shrinking has started (tension stress), and the inner part where shrinking has not occurred (compression stress). The heartwood dries more slowly than the sapwood, because the heartwood substance infiltrates the cell walls and covers the aspirated pits and decreases the moisture movement. Therefore, the timber containing the sapwood at the outer part will exhibit larger moisture gradients and drying stresses across timber compared with the timber containing only heartwood. In this study, timber 1 of the cultivars was mostly occupied by the heartwood, except for boka-sugi, whereas timber 4 contained the sapwood at the outer part (Table  1). Therefore, timber 1 might have smaller moisture gradients across the timber and less drying stress compared with timber 4. The difference in <b>surface</b> <b>check</b> along the stem was smaller for aya-sugi and yabukuguri than the other cultivars (Fig.  2; Table  3), which can be attributed to the similar HWPs of timber 1 and 4. Timber with a high percentage of heartwood and the timber with a high moisture content of heartwood will exhibit different drying speeds and drying stress, even if their average moisture contents are the same. To minimize the variation in moisture content and <b>surface</b> <b>check</b> after drying, it is better to classify the green timber not only for the average moisture content, but also for the HWP and the heartwood moisture content.|$|E

30|$|This {{study showed}} the {{dimension}} {{effect on the}} <b>surface</b> <b>checking</b> was different for the source heights and cultivars, depending on the proportion of heartwood and sapwood. It is suggested that {{a high proportion of}} sapwood induced more <b>surface</b> <b>checking,</b> because the drying stress between the sapwood and the heartwood would be larger when the timber contains more sapwood. In order to confirm the effect of the heartwood proportion on the drying checks, the moisture gradient, shrinkage, drying stress and stress relaxation, and occurrence of drying checks will need to be monitored with different heartwood proportions. To understand the variation of <b>surface</b> <b>checking,</b> not only the variation of the moisture content [20 – 22] and shrinkage [5, 7], but also the variation of the tangential strength [23] and viscoelasticity [24 – 26] will need to be studied. A desirable drying schedule for timber containing a large portion of sapwood would reduce the moisture content gradient from the surface to the interior of the timber. For example, Noji et al. [27] showed that a local steam explosion treatment reduced the moisture gradient through the thickness during drying, and the drying stress, and <b>surface</b> <b>checks.</b>|$|R
30|$|To {{investigate}} the factors affecting the surface-check variation in boxed-heart square timber of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica), <b>surface</b> <b>checks</b> {{formed by the}} conventional kiln drying were compared for two stem heights of five cultivars with different wood properties. The total length and average length of the <b>surface</b> <b>checks</b> were greater at {{the upper part of}} the stems for all the cultivars. This might be caused by more sapwood at {{the upper part of the}} stem, and large drying stresses between the outer sapwood and the inner heartwood. The cultivars, in which tangential shrinkage was large owing to small microfibril angle, formed longer <b>surface</b> <b>checks</b> and smaller bow. There was a positive relationship between surface-check length and tangential shrinkage. The heartwood percentage and tangential shrinkage were thought to be important factors affecting the surface-check variation in sugi boxed-heart square timber.|$|R
30|$|Yabukuguri and kumotooshi, {{which were}} harvested, sawn, and kiln dried together, {{exhibited}} differences in <b>surface</b> <b>check.</b> Yabukuguri {{had a large}} number of short checks, while kumotooshi had a small number of long checks, including checks for the full length of each timber from end to end (Fig.  2). When the short-end-surface checks were excluded, the total length and average length of surface checks were shorter for yabukuguri than kumotooshi (Table  3). The difference is most likely caused by the tangential shrinkage being smaller for yabukuguri than kumotooshi (Table  2). Our previous study [7] showed the difference in shrinkage between the two cultivars was due to the MFA, which was larger for yabukuguri than kumotooshi, while their density was at the same level. The surface-check difference between the two cultivars is also likely to be caused by the heartwood moisture content. This was higher for kumotooshi, and its heartwood took longer time to dry, which would have caused larger moisture gradients between the heartwood and sapwood.|$|E

Five hundred and sixty trees from 129 families and three central Victorian races were sampled from an open-pollinated progeny trial in Tasmania, Australia. Acoustic wave velocity (AWV) was assessed on standing-trees and sawlogs. Wedges from disks extracted from sawlogs were assessed for basic density and checking. Processed boards from 496 of the trees were assessed for board stiffness (static modulus of elasticity, MOE), and internal and surface checking. Genetic differences among races were significant for AWV and MOE traits. The Southern race had the highest mean values for these traits. Significant additive genetic variation within races was observed in all traits, demonstrating that the quality of plantation-grown E. nitens boards could be improved through breeding. Estimated narrow-sense heritabilities were 0. 85 for standing-tree AWV, 0. 71 for log AWV, 0. 37 for board MOE, and ranged from 0. 20 to 0. 52 for checking traits. A strongly positive genetic correlation (rg = 1. 05) was observed between standing-tree AWV and board MOE, indicating that AWV {{could be used as a}} selection trait to improve E. nitens board stiffness.
