Xenosaga Freaks and Xenosaga: The Animation each also <b>sparked</b> <b>the</b> release of a soundtrack album. In addition to the albums, Episode I saw the release of a book of orchestral sheet music as well as a book of piano sheet music; Episode II had only a book of piano sheet music. Music from the series has been played multiple times in concerts, especially that of the first two games.|$|E
5|$|The exclamation of Eureka! {{attributed}} to Archimedes {{is the state}} motto of California. In this instance the word refers {{to the discovery of}} gold near Sutter's Mill in 1848 which <b>sparked</b> <b>the</b> California Gold Rush.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-19thcentury, Utica's {{canals and}} railroads {{supported}} industries producing furniture, locomotive headlights, steam gauges, firearms, textiles and lumber. World War I <b>sparked</b> <b>the</b> growth of Savage Arms, which produced the Lewis gun for the British Army, {{and the city}} prospered {{as one of the}} wealthiest per capita in the United States.|$|E
50|$|The 1997 WNBA season, the league's first, {{opened with}} a game between <b>the</b> <b>Sparks</b> and <b>the</b> New York Liberty at <b>the</b> <b>Sparks</b> home (<b>The</b> Forum) in Inglewood. <b>The</b> <b>Sparks</b> lost <b>the</b> game 57-67. <b>Sparks</b> player Penny Toler scored the league's first two points with a lay-up 59 seconds into <b>the</b> game. <b>The</b> <b>Sparks</b> {{finished}} {{with a record of}} 14-14. The team did compete for a playoff spot, but because of a loss to the Phoenix Mercury in the final game of <b>the</b> season, <b>the</b> <b>Sparks</b> missed <b>the</b> playoffs. In the 1998 WNBA season, <b>the</b> <b>Sparks</b> finished 12-18, missing the playoffs once more.|$|R

50|$|In pyrotechnics, {{iron filings}} and metal alloys such as {{magnalium}} {{may be used}} to create <b>sparks.</b> <b>The</b> quantity and style of sparks produced depends on the composition and pyrophoricity of the metal and can be used to identify the type of metal by <b>spark</b> testing. In <b>the</b> case of iron, the presence of carbon is required, as in carbon steel — about 0.7% is best for large <b>sparks.</b> <b>The</b> carbon burns explosively in the hot iron and this produces pretty, branching <b>sparks.</b> <b>The</b> color of <b>sparks</b> used in pyrotechnics is determined by the material that <b>the</b> <b>sparks</b> are made from, with the possibility of adding different chemical compounds to certain materials to further influence the color of <b>the</b> <b>sparks.</b> <b>The</b> duration a <b>spark’s</b> existence is determined by the initial size of the particle, with a larger size leading to a longer-lasting spark.|$|R
5|$|In July, Eric Garner died in New York City, after a New York City Police Department officer {{put him in}} a chokehold while arresting him. Garner's {{death has}} been cited as one of several police killings of African Americans that <b>sparked</b> <b>the</b> Black Lives Matter movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, {{attacks on}} ethnic Chinese throughout Java <b>sparked</b> <b>the</b> two-year Java War that pitted ethnic Chinese and Javanese forces against Dutch troops. Valckenier was later recalled to the Netherlands {{and charged with}} crimes related to the massacre. The massacre figures heavily in Dutch literature, and is also cited as a possible etymology for the names of several areas in Jakarta.|$|E
5|$|A {{resistance}} movement soon emerged. On 22 June 1941, the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment was formed near Sisak, {{as the first}} military unit formed by a {{resistance movement}} in occupied Europe. This <b>sparked</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the Yugoslav Partisan movement, a communist multi-ethnic anti-fascist resistance group led by Josip Broz Tito. The movement grew rapidly and at the Tehran Conference in December 1943 the Partisans gained recognition from the Allies.|$|E

5|$|After having <b>sparked</b> <b>the</b> {{interest}} of the tabloids about his appearances at events with former model, amputee, and campaigner against landmines Heather Mills, McCartney appeared publicly beside her {{at a party in}} January2000, to celebrate her 32nd birthday. On 11June2002, McCartney married Mills in an elaborate ceremony at Castle Leslie in Glaslough, County Monaghan, Ireland, where more than 300 guests were invited and the reception included a vegetarian banquet. On 28 October 2003, Mills gave birth to a daughter, Beatrice Milly McCartney, although the date has also been stated as 30October.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} British cities, there was {{immigration}} from various Commonwealth {{countries in the}} post war years, which did lead to some racist tension. In 1963, a colour bar operated by Bristol Omnibus Company, which at that time refused to employ Black or Asian bus crews, was successfully challenged in the Bristol Bus Boycott, which was considered to have been instrumental in the eventual passage of the Race Relations Act 1968. In 1980 a police raid on a cafe in St Paul's <b>sparked</b> <b>the</b> St Pauls riot, which highlighted the alienation of the city's ethnic minorities.|$|E
5|$|Detectives began re-examining 10,000 witness statements, and {{submitting}} {{items for}} forensic tests {{not available in}} 1985. In September 2004 the back garden of a terraced council house in Willan Road, near the Broadwater Farm estate, was excavated after a tip-off. A female friend of Cynthia Jarrett, the woman whose death <b>sparked</b> <b>the</b> Broadwater Farm riot, lived alone at the house between 1984 and 1989, {{and according to the}} Evening Standard {{was one of the first}} on the scene when police raided Jarrett's house.|$|E
50|$|The 2011 {{season was}} eerily {{reminiscent}} {{of the previous year}} for <b>the</b> <b>Sparks.</b> <b>The</b> team started 4-3 but again Parker sustained an injury. Following three more losses, <b>the</b> <b>Sparks</b> fired head coach Gillom, promoting previous Sparks coach Joe Bryant. With Parker out until the end of <b>the</b> season, <b>the</b> <b>Sparks</b> headed into <b>the</b> All-Star break 6-8 and in fifth place. <b>The</b> <b>Sparks</b> finished <b>the</b> season three games out of the playoffs with a 15-19 record. Thompson would become a free agent and sign with the Seattle Storm.|$|R

5|$|Frederick of Prussia's {{invasion}} of Saxony in August 1756 began a Third Silesian War and <b>sparked</b> <b>the</b> wider Seven Years' War. Empress Maria Theresa and Kaunitz wished {{to exit the}} war with possession of Silesia. Austria was aligned with France and Russia, Great Britain with Prussia and Portugal. Giving Austria huge subsidies came back to haunt France. It could not bolster defences in New France; the British easily captured Louisbourg in 1758, {{and went on to}} conquer all of New France.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{four new}} {{performances}} were scheduled, taking stage in Tokyo, Stockholm, and a reprise in Cologne. These performances featured slightly modified {{versions of the}} original arrangements, and like the original concerts, were sold out. Another performance was held in London in October 2016 by the London Symphony Orchestra. The original concert and the Tokyo concert both <b>sparked</b> <b>the</b> release of an album. These albums, along with the concerts themselves, were heavily praised, both {{for the quality of}} the performance and for the quality of Valtonen's arrangements, which overlaid themes from multiple pieces rather than relying on a traditional medley.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century AD, the French Port-Royal Grammarians {{developed}} {{the idea that}} the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the comparative method by British philologist and expert on ancient India William Jones <b>sparked</b> <b>the</b> rise of comparative linguistics. The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by Wilhelm von Humboldt. Early in the 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.|$|E

On 16 March 1924, she saluted King Victor Emmanuel III when he arrived in Fiume to attend the ceremony commemorating the city's annexation by Italy. San Marco escorted Crown Prince Umberto, travelling aboard San Giorgio, during his South American tour in July–September 1924.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{sent the}} invading Iraqi forces into {{neighboring}} Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq {{as part of}} its territory. This invasion <b>sparked</b> <b>the</b> initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation. An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border. The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S. Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.|$|E

5|$|Partnership for Peace (PfP) {{membership}} {{was offered}} to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia. NATO hoped {{that this would}} bring these countries more into the Euro-Atlantic community as the PfP is a programme of practical bilateral cooperation between individual Partner countries and NATO, thereby allowing Partner countries {{to choose their own}} priorities for cooperation. It is expected that PfP membership is for these three countries the first step towards NATO membership. As a result, the PfP offer <b>sparked</b> <b>the</b> anger of the UN tribunal trying suspected war criminals from the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Provence {{urged the}} king to act {{strongly}} against the declaration, while the king's popular minister Jacques Necker intended to {{compromise with the}} new assembly. Louis XVI was characteristically indecisive. On 9 July, the assembly declared itself a National Constituent Assembly that would give France a Constitution. On 11 July, Louis XVI dismissed Necker, which led to widespread rioting across Paris. On 12 July, the sabre charge of the cavalry regiment of Charles-Eugène de Lorraine, prince de Lambesc, on a crowd gathered at the Tuileries gardens, <b>sparked</b> <b>the</b> Storming of the Bastille two days later.|$|E
