5|$|When lasers {{were first}} invented, laser <b>speckle</b> was {{considered}} to be a severe drawback in using lasers to illuminate objects, particularly in holographic imaging because of the grainy image produced. It was later realized that <b>speckle</b> patterns could carry information about the object's surface deformations. Butters and Leendertz developed the technique of <b>speckle</b> pattern interferometry in 1970, and since then, <b>speckle</b> has been exploited in a variety of other applications. A photograph is made of the <b>speckle</b> pattern before deformation, and a second photograph is made of the <b>speckle</b> pattern after deformation. Digital subtraction of the two images results in a correlation fringe pattern, where the fringes represent lines of equal deformation. Short laser pulses in the nanosecond range can be used to capture very fast transient events. A phase problem exists: In the absence of other information, one cannot tell the difference between contour lines indicating a peak versus contour lines indicating a trough. To resolve the issue of phase ambiguity, ESPI may be combined with phase shifting methods.|$|E
5|$|During the {{occultation}} of 29 May 1979 {{the discovery}} of a possible tiny satellite with a diameter of about 1km was reported, which was never confirmed. In 1980, <b>speckle</b> interferometry was reported as indicating a much larger satellite with a diameter of 175km, whose existence was later refuted.|$|E
5|$|Electronic <b>speckle</b> pattern {{interferometry}} (ESPI), {{also known}} as TV holography, uses video detection and recording to produce {{an image of the}} object upon which is superimposed a fringe pattern which represents the displacement of the object between recordings. (see Fig.21) The fringes are similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Fixed-scale <b>speckles</b> {{are used}} in {{existing}} ghost imaging system, while the current instrument can achieve multi-scale <b>speckles</b> ghost imaging. This paper focuses on the research of compressed sensing ghost imaging system using multi-scale <b>speckles.</b> Through the computer simulation and using the four resolution scales image as the original image, restored images are obtained to analysis {{on a variety of}} different scales and different proportion of <b>speckles</b> cases. The results show that the compressed sensing ghost imaging system using multi-scale <b>speckles</b> can get closer to the true value of image. And when the small scale <b>speckles</b> occupy large proportion, the recovered image resolution is not disturbed...|$|R
50|$|After a long journey, {{the herd}} {{arrives at a}} new, fertile area in which to settle. However, <b>Speckles</b> once again {{encounters}} One-Eye, who has been driven out by the same natural disaster. Just as he did before, One-Eye causes the herbivores to stampede in order to ambush <b>Speckles</b> and his two babies. Another child is killed and the remaining child, <b>Speckles</b> Jr., is knocked off a cliff into the ocean during the ensuing fight. <b>Speckles</b> dives into the sea to save him, but pursued by One-Eye. After a long fight in the ocean, One Eye is attacked and eaten {{by a pair of}} Tylosaurus. <b>Speckles</b> eventually reaches <b>Speckles</b> Jr. and returns him safely to shore.|$|R
40|$|Male {{secondary}} sexual traits {{may increase}} the risk of predation because mating signals make them conspicuous to predators and hamper evasive manoeuvres. Males of Xenotoca variata, a viviparous freshwater fish, show on their flanks bright and colourful spots (<b>speckles),</b> the number of which varies geographically. In this study, the association of this variation with the presence of the piscivorous snake Thamnophis melanogaster, which co-occurs with X. variata, was investigated. A test was also done to establish whether the snake distinguishes between male fish with contrasting numbers of <b>speckles</b> and if the perception of <b>speckles</b> is influenced by water turbidity. The amount of <b>speckling</b> and the prevalence of snakes in key localities was assessed by using one-way mirrors, and the effect of <b>speckles</b> on the predatory responsiveness of snakes was evaluated by presenting them with pairs of male fish in clear and in turbid water. In localities where snakes were infrequent there was a tendency for male fish to have many <b>speckles.</b> The snakes preferentially approached the males with more <b>speckles</b> than the males with fewer <b>speckles.</b> The direction of the preference did not change with the conditions of the water, but the magnitude was stronger in clear water than in turbid water. The snakes also approached first the males with more <b>speckles.</b> These findings indicate that predation risk by T. melanogaster may select against <b>speckles</b> and produce population differentiation...|$|R
5|$|Pleione {{is known}} to be a <b>speckle</b> binary, {{although}} its orbital parameters have yet to be fully established. In 1996 a group of Japanese and French astronomers discovered that Pleione is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 218.0 days and a large eccentricity of 0.6. The Washington Double Star Catalogue lists an angular separation between the two components of 0.2 arcsecondsan angle which equates to a distance of about 24 AU, assuming a distance of 120 parsecs.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{detection}} of a transit signal by Kepler, follow-up observations {{were taken to}} confirm the planetary nature of the candidate. <b>Speckle</b> imaging by the WIYN Telescope {{was used to determine}} the amount of light from nearby, background stars that was present. If not accounted for, this light would have made Kepler-6 appear brighter than it actually was. Consequently, the size of Kepler-6b would have been underestimated. Radial velocity data was taken by HIRES at the Keck I telescope {{in order to determine the}} mass of the planet. Independently, observations were made with the Spitzer Space Telescope at infrared wavelengths of 3.6 and 4.5 micrometres. Along with additional data taken by Kepler, these observations detected the occultation and phase curves of Kepler-6b behind its star.|$|E
5|$|After {{the stellar}} {{parameters}} were established, the Kepler science team ran models and fits {{to ensure that}} Kepler-5's transit event was not a false positive, such as an eclipsing binary star. Once the planetary nature of Kepler-5b was established, the Kepler team searched for the planet's occultation behind its star, hoping to find the temperature on its day side. They found both, {{and were able to}} set the equilibrium temperature of the planet. The use of <b>speckle</b> imaging using adaptive optics at the WIYN Observatory in Arizona and the Palomar Observatory in California isolated the starlight of Kepler-5 from background stars.|$|E

The animators realistically recreated what an explosion {{would look like}} in space: short blasts, which suck inward and leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program was used to simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers of rocks and wind sucking into the planet. Unlike other Star Trek films and series, the transporter beam effects swirl rather than <b>speckle.</b> Abrams conceived the redesign to emphasize the notion of transporters as beams that can pick up and move people, rather than a signal composed of scrambled atoms.|$|E
5|$|The WIYN Observatory's 3.5m {{telescope}} {{was used for}} <b>speckle</b> imaging on June 18, 2010; in addition, the PHARO camera on the Palomar Observatory's 5m {{telescope was}} used for its adaptive optics capabilities. These observations, combined with observations of Kepler-10's spectrum taken from the W.M. Keck Observatory, ruled {{out the possibility that}} a nearby star's light was corrupting the observed spectrum of Kepler-10 and creating the results that had led astronomers to believe that a second planet existed in Kepler-10's orbit. All of these possibilities, with the exception of if such a star existed exactly behind or in front of Kepler-10, were effectively ruled out; even with this, the Kepler team found that if a star was indeed aligned with Kepler-10 as seen from Earth, such a star would probably not be a giant star.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{shifting}} interferometry overcomes {{these limitations}} by not relying on finding fringe centers, {{but rather by}} collecting intensity data from every point of the CCD image sensor. As seen in Fig.17, multiple interferograms (at least three) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Alternatively, precise phase shifts can be introduced by modulating the laser frequency. The captured images are processed by a computer to calculate the optical wavefront errors. The precision and reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static interferogram analysis, with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being routine. Phase shifting technology has been adapted {{to a variety of}} interferometer types such as Twyman-Green, Mach–Zehnder, laser Fizeau, and even common path configurations such as point diffraction and lateral shearing interferometers. More generally, phase shifting techniques can be adapted to almost any system that uses fringes for measurement, such as holographic and <b>speckle</b> interferometry.|$|E

40|$|The A-type lamins {{have been}} {{observed}} to colocalize with RNA splicing factors in <b>speckles</b> within the nucleus, {{in addition to their}} typical distribution at the nuclear periphery. To understand the functions of lamin <b>speckles,</b> the effects of transcriptional inhibitors known to modify RNA splicing factor compartments (SFCs) were examined. Treatment of HeLa cells with �-amanitin or 5, 6 dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB) inhibited RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription and led to the enlargement of lamin <b>speckles</b> as well as SFCs. Removal of the reversible inhibitor DRB resulted in the reactivation of transcription and a rapid, synchronous redistribution of lamins and splicing factors to normal-sized <b>speckles,</b> indicating a close association between lamin <b>speckles</b> and SFCs. Conversely, the expression of NH 2 -terminally modified lamin A or C in HeLa cells brought about a loss of lamin <b>speckles,</b> depletion of SFCs, and down-regulation of pol II transcription without affecting the peripheral lamina. Our results suggest a unique role for lamin <b>speckles</b> in the spatial organization of RNA splicing factors and pol II transcription in the nucleus...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear <b>speckles</b> (<b>speckles)</b> {{represent}} a distinct nuclear compartment within the interchromatin space and are enriched in splicing factors. They {{have been shown}} to serve neighboring active genes as a reservoir of these factors. In this study, we show that, in HeLa cells, the (pre) spliceosomal assembly on precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) is associated with the <b>speckles.</b> For this purpose, we used microinjection of splicing competent and mutant adenovirus pre-mRNAs with differential splicing factor binding, which form different (pre) spliceosomal complexes and followed their sites of accumulation. Splicing competent pre-mRNAs are rapidly targeted into the <b>speckles,</b> but the targeting is temperature-dependent. The polypyrimidine tract sequence is required for targeting, but, in itself, is not sufficient. The downstream flanking sequences are particularly important for the targeting of the mutant pre-mRNAs into the <b>speckles.</b> In supportive experiments, the behavior of the <b>speckles</b> was followed after the microinjection of antisense deoxyoligoribonucleotides complementary to the specific domains of snRNAs. Under these latter conditions prespliceosomal complexes are formed on endogenous pre-mRNAs. We conclude that the (pre) spliceosomal complexes on microinjected pre-mRNA are formed inside the <b>speckles.</b> Their targeting into and accumulation in the <b>speckles</b> {{is a result of the}} cumulative loading of splicing factors to the pre-mRNA and the complexes formed give rise to the speckled pattern observed...|$|R

25|$|Off-axis HPIV uses {{separate}} beams {{to provide}} the object and reference waves. This setup is used to avoid <b>speckle</b> noise form being generated from interference of the two waves within the scattering medium, which would occur if they were both propagated through the medium. An off-axis experiment is a highly complex optical system comprising numerous optical elements, and the reader is referred to an example schematic in Sheng et al. for a more complete presentation.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} issues degrade the quality of HPIV results. The first class of issues {{involves}} the reconstruction itself. In holography, the object wave of a particle is typically assumed to be spherical; however, due to Mie scattering theory, this wave is a complex shape which can distort the reconstructed particle. Another issue {{is the presence of}} substantial <b>speckle</b> noise which lowers the overall signal-to-noise ratio of particle images. This effect is of greater concern for in-line holographic systems because the reference beam is propagated through the volume along with the scattered object beam. Noise can also be introduced through impurities in the scattering medium, such as temperature variations and window blemishes. Because holography requires coherent imaging, these effects are much more severe than traditional imaging conditions. The combination of these factors increases the complexity of the correlation process. In particular, the <b>speckle</b> noise in an HPIV recording often prevents traditional image-based correlation methods from being used. Instead, single particle identification and correlation are implemented, which set limits on particle number density. A more comprehensive outline of these error sources is given in Meng et al.|$|E

40|$|Despite being {{densely packed}} with chromatin, nuclear bodies and a nucleoskeletal network, the nucleus is a remarkably dynamic organelle. Chromatin loops form and relax, RNA {{transcripts}} and transcription factors move diffusively, and nuclear bodies move. We show here that RNA splicing speckled domains (splicing <b>speckles)</b> fluctuate in constrained nuclear volumes and remodel their shapes. Small <b>speckles</b> {{move in a}} directed way toward larger <b>speckles</b> with which they fuse. This directed movement is reduced upon decreasing cellular ATP levels or inhibiting RNA polymerase II activity. The random movement of <b>speckles</b> is reduced upon decreasing cellular ATP levels, moderately reduced after inhibition of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling and modestly increased upon inhibiting RNA polymerase II activity. To define the paths through which <b>speckles</b> can translocate in the nucleus, we generated a pressure gradient to create flows in the nucleus. In response to the pressure gradient, <b>speckles</b> moved along curvilinear paths in the nucleus. Collectively, our results demonstrate {{a new type of}} ATP-dependent motion in the nucleus. We present a model where recycling splicing factors return as part of small sub-speckles from distal sites of RNA processing to larger splicing <b>speckles</b> by a directed ATP-driven mechanism through interchromatin spaces...|$|R

Nuclear <b>speckles</b> (<b>speckles)</b> {{are a part of the}} nuclei of cells and are enriched with splicing factors known for involvement in mRNA processing. Nuclear <b>speckles</b> have shown to serve neighboring active genes as storage places of these splicing factors. In this study, researchers showed that, in HeLa cells which derived from cells of a person who had cervical cancer and have proven useful for experiments, the first group of spliceosomes on pre-mRNA come from these <b>speckles.</b> Researchers used microinjections of spliceosome-accepting and mutant adenovirus pre-mRNAs with differential splicing factor binding to make different groups and then followed the sites in which they were heavily present. Spliceosome-accepting pre-mRNAs were rapidly targeted into the <b>speckles,</b> but the targeting was found to be temperature-dependent. The polypyrimidine tract sequences in mRNA promote the construction of spliceosome groups and is required for targeting, but, by itself, was not sufficient.

Under these conditions, spliceosome groups formed on endogenous pre-mRNAs. Researchers concluded that the spliceosome groups on microinjected pre-mRNA form inside the <b>speckles.</b> Pre-mRNA targeting and buildup in the <b>speckles</b> is a result of the loading of splicing factors to the pre-mRNA, and the spliceosome groups gave rise to the speckled pattern observed.|$|R

Based on its spectra, it has a significant excess of elements heavier than helium. In fact the ratio of iron to hydrogen is considered close to the upper limit for dwarf stars in the galactic disk. The star is a suspected spectroscopic binary with a reported period of 494 days, but the companion was not confirmed through <b>speckle</b> interferometry.

25|$|Fiber with a core {{diameter}} less than about {{ten times the}} wavelength of the propagating light cannot be modeled using geometric optics. Instead, it must be analyzed as an electromagnetic structure, by solution of Maxwell's equations as reduced to the electromagnetic wave equation. The electromagnetic analysis may also be required to understand behaviors such as <b>speckle</b> that occur when coherent light propagates in multi-mode fiber. As an optical waveguide, the fiber supports one or more confined transverse modes by which light can propagate along the fiber. Fiber supporting only one mode is called single-mode or mono-mode fiber. The behavior of larger-core multi-mode fiber can also be modeled using the wave equation, which shows that such fiber supports more than one mode of propagation (hence the name). The results of such modeling of multi-mode fiber approximately agree with the predictions of geometric optics, if the fiber core {{is large enough to}} support more than a few modes.|$|E
