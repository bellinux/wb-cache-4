5|$|This duality {{extends from}} {{individual}} cutsets and cycles to vector spaces defined from them. The cycle {{space of a}} graph {{is defined as the}} family of all subgraphs that have even degree at each vertex; it {{can be viewed as a}} vector space over the two-element finite field, with the <b>symmetric</b> <b>difference</b> of two sets of edges acting as the vector addition operation in the vector space. Similarly, the cut space of a graph is defined as the family of all cutsets, with vector addition defined in the same way. Then the cycle space of any planar graph and the cut space of its dual graph are isomorphic as vector spaces. Thus, the rank of a planar graph (the dimension of its cut space) equals the cyclotomic number of its dual (the dimension of its cycle space) and vice versa. A cycle basis of a graph is a set of simple cycles that form a basis of the cycle space (every even-degree subgraph can be formed in exactly one way as a <b>symmetric</b> <b>difference</b> of some of these cycles). For edge-weighted planar graphs (with sufficiently general weights that no two cycles have the same weight) the minimum-weight cycle basis of the graph is dual to the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph, a collection of nested cuts that together include a minimum cut separating each pair of vertices in the graph. Each cycle in the minimum weight cycle basis has a set of edges that are dual to the edges of one of the cuts in the Gomory–Hu tree. When cycle weights may be tied, the minimum-weight cycle basis may not be unique, but in this case it is still true that the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph corresponds to one of the minimum weight cycle bases of the graph.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, by {{analyzing}} the characteristics of infrared moving targets, a <b>Symmetric</b> Frame <b>Differencing</b> Target Detection algorithm based on local clustering segmentation is proposed. In consideration of the high real-time performance and accuracy of traditional <b>symmetric</b> <b>differencing,</b> this novel algorithm uses local grayscale clustering to accomplish target detection after carrying out <b>symmetric</b> frame <b>differencing</b> to locate the regions of change. In addition, the mean shift tracking algorithm is also improved {{to solve the problem}} of missed targets caused by error convergence. As a result, a kernel-based mean shift target tracking algorithm based on detection updates is also proposed. This tracking algorithm makes use of the interaction between detection and tracking to correct the tracking errors in real time and to realize robust target tracking in complex scenes. In addition, the validity, robustness and stability of the proposed algorithms are all verified by experiments on mid-infrared aerial sequences with vehicles as targets...|$|R
25|$|How do we {{make sure}} {{augmented}} paths are vertex disjoint? It is already guaranteed: After doing the <b>symmetric</b> <b>difference</b> for a path, none of its vertices could be considered again just because the Dist will not be equal to Dist + 1 (It would be exactly Dist).|$|E
25|$|Both {{approaches}} use {{the observation}} that in claw-free graphs, no vertex can have more than two neighbors in an independent set, and so the <b>symmetric</b> <b>difference</b> of two independent sets must induce a subgraph of degree at most two; that is, it is a union of paths and cycles. In particular, if I is a non-maximum independent set, it differs from any maximum independent set by even cycles and so called augmenting paths: induced paths which alternate between vertices not in I and vertices in I, and for which both endpoints have only one neighbor in I. As the <b>symmetric</b> <b>difference</b> of I with any augmenting path gives a larger independent set, the task thus reduces to searching for augmenting paths until no more can be found, analogously as in algorithms for finding maximum matchings.|$|E

25|$|Every Boolean algebra {{gives rise}} to a Boolean ring, and vice versa, with ring {{multiplication}} corresponding to conjunction or meet ∧, and ring addition to exclusive disjunction or <b>symmetric</b> <b>difference</b> (not disjunction ∨).

25|$|Once we {{have found}} the {{augmented}} shortest path, {{we want to make}} sure we ignore any other paths that are longer than this shortest paths. BFS algorithm marks nodes in path with distance with source being 0. Thus, after doing BFS, we can start at each unmatched vertex in U, follow the path by following nodes with distance that increments by 1. When we finally arrive at the destination vDummy, if its distance is 1 more than last node in V then we know that the path we followed is (one of the possibly many) shortest path. In that case we can go ahead and update the pairing for vertices on path in U and V. Note that each vertex in V on path, except for the last one, is non-free vertex. So updating pairing for these vertices in V to different vertices in U is equivalent to removing previously matched edge and adding new unmatched edge in matching. This is same as doing the <b>symmetric</b> <b>difference</b> (i.e. remove edges common to previous matching and add non-common edges in augmented path in new matching).|$|E
