The present contribution takes this as its starting point. With the aid of discrimination analysis it is established which variables can be drawn on to describe significant group differences. Empirical investigations show clear differences in innovation behaviour between <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>firms</b> and incumbent firms. Both groups of companies differ most greatly in resource input during the R&D and innovation phase. The variables, ‚personnel expenditure per employee', ‚investment expenditure per employee', ‚R&D employment intensity'and ‚innovation expenditure per employee in the launch phase' display the highest discrimination coefficients. But also the sales share of new products as an indicator of the firm's innovation output is characterized by a significant separatory power.

40|$|This essay {{develops}} {{and links}} two models of ownership: first a composition {{model of the}} dimensions comprising ownership in firms, and a content model specifying the societal, firm, and individual factors {{that give rise to}} workers’ motivation to participate in ownership and employers’ motivation to share ownership. Ownership comprises financial participation, including control over residual assets, access to marginal revenues, participation in decision making, and access to financial information; along with sociopsychological factors including social standing, social responsibility, and psychological ownership. Firm ownership, across financial and sociopsychological facets, is increasingly parcelled out among financial investors, managers and workers. This new distribution of ownership is particularly characteristic of high technology and <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>firms,</b> due to the mobility of highly skilled workers, and their consequent power in the employment relationship. We specify how societal factors, firm characteristics, and worker qualities impact the motivation to own and the motivation to share ownership.

50|$|A {{monopoly}} {{can raise}} prices and retain customers because the monopoly has no competitors. If a customer {{has no other}} place to go to obtain the goods or services, they either pay the increased price or do without. Thus the key to market power is to preclude competition through high barriers of entry. Barriers to entry that are significant sources of market power are control of scarce resources, increasing returns to scale, technological superiority and government created barriers to entry. OPEC {{is an example of}} an organization that has market power due to control over scarce resources — oil. Increasing returns to scale are another important source of market power. Firms experiencing increasing returns to scale are also experiencing decreasing average total costs. Firms in such industries become more profitable with size. Therefore over time the industry is dominated by a few large firms. This dominance makes it difficult for <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>firms</b> to succeed. Firms like power companies, cable television companies and wireless communication companies with large <b>start</b> <b>up</b> costs fall within this category. A company wishing to enter such industries must have the financial ability to spend millions of dollars before starting operations and generating any revenue. Similarly established firms also have a competitive advantage over new firms. An established firm threatened by a new competitor can lower prices to drive out the competition. Microsoft is a firm that has substantial pricing or market power due to technological superiority in its design and production processes. Finally government created barriers to entry can be a source of market power. A prime example are patents granted to pharmaceutical companies. These patents give the drug companies a virtual monopoly in the protected product for the term of the patent.|$|R

This labor market imperfection induces firm-specific wage payments and involuntary unemployment of workers.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade the high {{unemployment}} rate in Europe, compared to the U. S., {{has been attributed to}} specific labor market problems of the Euro-pean economy. Recently, U. S. labor market specialists have become skeptical to consider labor market rigidities as the sole cause for the high and persistent unemployment in Europe. It has been argued that Europe, compared to the U. S., has lacked a sufficiently high rate of job creation. This may be due to, as recent empirical studies of the OECD show, large differences in creating new knowledge, human capital and innovations, accompanied by entrepreneurship and new <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>firms,</b> between the U. S. and Europe. In order to shed some light on those new forces of economic growth and the creation of jobs we employ a modified version of Romer’s (1990) model of endogenous growth. We confront our model with stylized facts employing U. S. and European time series data. We then estimate the parameters with time series data for the U. S. and Germany. We show that, although the long run growth rate may not be affected by scaling up the new forces of economic growth, our model, however, suggests that there are transitory effects arising from the new forces of economic growth which positively affect the labor market. Furthermore, in order to give a qualitative assessment of such transitory effects we present a collection of time series data for some main OECD- countries. ∗Center for Empirical Macroeconomics and Department of Economics, University of Bielefeld. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} increased corporate mobility on corporate lawmaking in the European Union (EU). More specifically, we seek an answer to a simple question: Has the increased mobility which arose from {{the implementation of the}} Societas Europaea (SE) and the path-breaking decisions of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) led to an outbreak of regulatory competition and the emergence of a Delaware-like member state in Europe? Two types of corporate mobility are distinguished: (1) the incorporation mobility of <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>firms</b> and (2) the reincorporation mobility of established firms. As to incorporation mobility, the Centros triad of cases makes it possible for start-up firms to incorporate in a foreign jurisdiction. Many entrepreneurs have taken advantage of this new freedom of establishment. However, recent data from Germany and The Netherlands indicate declining numbers of such foreign incorporations over time. Moreover, Centros-based incorporation mobility is a rather trivial phenomenon, economically speaking. The actors in question seek only to minimize costs of incorporation. National lawmakers have been responding, amending their statutes to lower these costs. But, because out of pocket cost minimization at the organization stage operates as only a secondary motivation of 'choice-of-business-form' decisions, there arise no competitive pressures that cause national legislatures to engage in thorough-going reform addressed to corporate governance more generally. As to reincorporation mobility, which concerns the migration of the statutory seat of a firm incorporated in one member state to another member state, the SE has opened the door, but not widely enough to serve as a catalyst for company law arbitrage. Reincorporation mobility is still far from generally available in the EU. As a result, competitive pressures do not yet motivate changes in the fundamental governance provisions of national corporate law regimes...|$|R
30|$|While {{there is}} a growing {{literature}} on the development impacts of the rising flows of remittances to poorer countries, it is only fairy recently that {{attention has been paid to}} the potential of return migrants to <b>start</b> <b>up</b> enterprises in their home countries. This reflects the greater awareness of the fact that most migration is not permanent, but temporary (Mesnard 2004). Hence, migrants may learn while away from their home country or region, as well as gather savings and build foreign networks, all of which may alleviate constraints on starting a new enterprise upon return (Marchetta 2012; Rapoport 2002). However, while abroad, migrants may lose contact with their networks at home and hence experience a depreciation of their social capital, which may make it more difficult to establish a new enterprise upon return. Accordingly, to the extent that credit constraints and a lack of skills and experience are obstacles to entrepreneurship in developing countries, and social capital is not as crucial, one may expect return migrants to be more likely to be able to <b>start</b> <b>up</b> new <b>firms</b> than non-migrants (Wahba and Zenou 2012).|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} on industrial clusters indicates {{a symbiotic relationship}} between innovation and geographical concentration of firms working in similar industries. Innovative processes require different forms of knowledge and exper- tise, which are distributed across individuals and organisations {{at different levels of}} industrial clusters.

40|$|This chapter aims {{to propose}} a {{bottom-up}} conceptual framework as a complement in risk return analyses that is particularly suitable for private firms and ultimately, {{the study of the}} relationship between managerial choices and firm exposition to the unlevered systematic risk. This theoretical framework considers both a financial and managerial perspective in conducting a managerial analysis of the unlevered beta that {{can be used as a}} tool to evaluate, in static and dynamic terms, the correlation between the unlevered systematic risk and firm’s structure. Our analysis is based on a revision of the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model), which is the main tool used by financial analysts to estimate the risk-return profile of a single stock. Particularly, the proposed revision of the CAPM is founded on the idea that the unlevered systematic risk of a single firm can be analyzed in terms of the function of its structural characteristics and environmental volatility. This approach pursues two goals: the first is the adaptation of the CAPM logic to the risk-return analysis of unlisted firms and the second is the analysis of the connection between the dynamics of unlevered systematic risk and the managerial choices affecting firm’s structure. This approach can be very useful for <b>start</b> <b>up</b> <b>firms</b> and for those countries, as Italy, that are in need to foster innovation and to meet the EU targets, by 2020. The chapter is structured into five sections. The first section provides a literature review of the CAPM as well as the beta estimation, which is a measure of the systematic risk pertaining to a single asset. The second section explains our approach, considering the role of intrinsic business risk and operating leverage. The third section presents an analysis of the unlevered beta, according to the bottom-up approach, both in the stationary and development states. The fourth section analyzes the dynamic state as a factor that may increase or decrease the unlevered systematic risk. Finally, a managerial matrix of unlevered betas combines the analysis of the stationary and development states that proposes some useful managerial insights on the investigated issues...|$|R
