5|$|The Japanese {{permitted}} the POWs to build septic systems and irrigation ditches throughout the prisoner {{side of the}} camp. An onsite commissary was available to sell items such as bananas, eggs, coffee, notebooks, and cigarettes. Recreational activities allowed for baseball, horseshoes, and ping pong matches. In addition, a 3,000-book library was allowed (much of which {{was provided by the}} Red Cross), and films were shown occasionally. A bulldog was kept by the prisoners, and served as a mascot for the camp. Each year around Christmas, the Japanese guards gave permission for the Red Cross to donate a <b>small</b> <b>box</b> to each of the prisoners, containing items such as corned beef, instant coffee, and tobacco. Prisoners were also able to send postcards to relatives, although they were censored by the guards.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Dungeons & Dragons, now {{referred to}} as OD, was a <b>small</b> <b>box</b> set of three booklets published in 1974. It was amateurish in production and assumed the player was familiar with wargaming. Nevertheless, it grew rapidly in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold {{in the first year}} followed by 3,000 in 1975, and much more in the following years. This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions, such as the original Greyhawk and Blackmoor supplements (both 1975), as well as magazine articles in TSR's official publications and many fanzines.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, {{new details}} emerged in her murder investigation. Charges were brought against Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva (alias El Silva) and José Adrián Hernández Domínguez (alias El Jarocho), {{two men who}} were alleged to have murdered Martínez Pérez. Silva, who had already been arrested, confessed to the murder. According to Silva's confession, the {{reporter}} knew Domínguez and therefore allowed both of them into her house {{on the night of}} her murder. After some conversation, Domínguez grew angry and started beating Martínez Pérez with the intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions. Silva then joined his accomplice in the beating until they killed her. Investigators said that the attackers had plunged the journalist's head into a toilet bowl, hit her on the head several times with brass knuckles, and threw her against a tub, where she cracked her skull. Martínez Pérez unsuccessfully tried to defend herself by grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing one of the attackers in the forearm, but they managed to outweigh her because she only weighed 108lbs (48.9kg). Both men then stole a plasma TV, two cellphones, a laptop computer, a camera and a <b>small</b> <b>box,</b> and the journalist's wristband from her home before leaving the crime scene.|$|E

5|$|The weather {{continued}} to hamper the 9th Division's advance. The 26th Brigade, further inland, remained {{stuck on the}} eastern side of the Busu. On 10 September, the commandos providing flank security managed to get across the Sankwep River, close to its confluence with the Busu, pushing a kunda bridge across. Shortly afterwards, they clashed with a small party of Japanese attempting to advance towards the bridge, and several Japanese were killed. To reinvigorate the 26th, engineer support was brought up. The 2/7th Field Company was pushing a jeep track forward with the help of the 2/48th, and they subsequently arrived with boats, ropes and cables, and several attempts were made to get across, all of which eventually failed as the engineers came under fire from the opposite bank. Heavy clashes later took place as the Australians and Japanese fought desperately in the swamp around the crossing. As it became uncertain whether the 26th would be able to force their way across, a company from the 2/48th was sent south to use the 24th Brigade's crossing and then advance north along the western bank of the Busu to help secure the brigade's beachhead when it finally did get across. on 13 September further engineer stores arrived, including bridging equipment and folding boats, and the following day a <b>Small</b> <b>Box</b> Girder bridge was pushed across despite heavy fire from the opposite bank, allowing the 26th Brigade to get across the Busu on 14 September.|$|E

The SBR was the prized possession of the ordinary infantryman; when the British were forced to retreat during the German Spring Offensive of 1918, it was found that while some troops had discarded their rifles, hardly any had left behind their respirators.|$|E

40|$|Rats with hippocampal {{aspiration}} lesions {{and controls}} were trained on delayed nonmatching to sample with <b>small</b> complex goal <b>boxes,</b> presented trial uniquely. A {{series of experiments}} then used pairs of large or <b>small</b> <b>boxes,</b> presented repeatedly. The lesions impaired choice accuracy when the rats were tested with large empty boxes but not when <b>small</b> <b>boxes</b> containing 3 -dimensional objects were used. There was a comparable impairment when the rats were tested with pairs of large complex boxes, which contained arrays of objects, identical to those used in the <b>smaller</b> <b>boxes</b> but necessarily spaced further apart. Subsequent experiments revealed that the lesion deficit with large boxes was reduced by insertion of a continuous line of distinctive objects and eliminated by trial-unique presentation of large boxes. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} (non) spatial accounts of hippocampal function and the compensatory effects of novel object cues. We conclude that, for hippocampal rats, spatial cues, although useless, can nonetheless be profoundly disruptive...|$|R

It was put out that the gas helmets of the division were of inferior manufacture, to allay doubts as to the effectiveness of the helmet.

The chase was covered live by ABC News anchors Peter Jennings and Barbara Walters on behalf of ABC's five news magazines, which achieved some of their highest-ever ratings that week.
