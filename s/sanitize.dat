5|$|Owing to {{the timing}} of its dissipation, Emily spared {{neighboring}} Haiti from the devastation initially anticipated. At least 235 people in Jacmel and Tabarre, as well as 65 prisoners from Gonaïves and Miragoâne, required evacuation {{at the height of}} the storm. In Artibonite, civil protection teams evacuated roughly 300 residents. Rainfall triggered floods that damaged over 300 homes throughout the country, while several cholera treatment centers were destroyed. At the risk of new outbreaks, special sterilizers were distributed to <b>sanitize</b> possibly contaminated waters. A body was recovered from a ravine near Les Cayes, but the exact cause of death was disputed; another person in the area sustained injuries after being hit by a fallen tree. High winds caused some property damage in Léogâne and Jacmel.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary body {{piercing}} studios generally take numerous precautions {{to protect the}} health of the person being pierced and the piercer. Piercers are expected to <b>sanitize</b> the location to be pierced as well as their hands, even though they will often wear gloves during the procedure (and in some areas must, as it is prescribed by law). Quite frequently, these gloves will be changed multiple times, often one pair for each step of setup to avoid cross contamination. For example, after a piercer wearing gloves has cleaned the area to be pierced on a client, the piercer may change gloves to avoid recontaminating the area. Wearing sterile gloves is required by law for professional piercing procedures in some areas, such as the states of Florida and South Carolina. Tools and jewellery should be sterilized in autoclaves, and non-autoclavable surfaces should be cleaned with disinfectant agents on a regular basis and between clients.|$|E

5|$|G. Homer Durham, {{a member}} of the First Quorum of the Seventy, {{replaced}} Joseph Anderson as director of the Historical Department in 1977 and began restraining the History Division's activity. Durham required that all manuscripts go through him for approval before publication. He attempted to combine the Mormon History Trust Fund with the general department budget, but was prevented by Arrington. Durham also refrained from hiring new staff members to replace staff who had left. The multi-volume church history project was dropped, allowing the outside authors to seek publishers other than Deseret Book who would give them royalties and not be tempted to <b>sanitize</b> church history. Not all twelve authors completed their projects, but many books that started from the History Division project were later published through other publishers.|$|E

40|$|Context: Footwear {{should be}} {{designed}} to avoid trauma and injury to {{the skin of the}} feet that can favor bacterial and fungal infections. Procedures and substances for <b>sanitizing</b> the interior of shoes are uncommon but are important aspects of primary prevention against foot infections and unpleasant odor. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a <b>sanitizing</b> technique for reducing bacterial and fungal contamination of footwear. Design: Crossover study. Setting: Mens Sana basketball team. Patients or Other Participants: Twenty-seven male athletes and 4 coaches (62 shoes). Intervention(s) : The experimental protocol required a first sample (swab), 1 /shoe, at time 0 from inside the shoes of allathletes before the <b>sanitizing</b> technique began and a second sample at time 1, after about 4 weeks, April 2012 to May 2012, of daily use of the <b>sanitizing</b> technique.

25|$|Spinach is {{packaged}} in air, or in nitrogen gas to extend shelf life. Some packaged spinach {{is exposed to}} radiation to kill any harmful bacteria that {{may be on the}} leaves. The Food and Drug Administration approves of irradiation of spinach leaves up to 4.0 kilograys; however, using radiation to <b>sanitize</b> spinach is of concern because it may deplete the leaves of their nutritional value. Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service experimentally tested the concentrations of vitamins C, E, K, B9, and four carotenoids in packaged spinach following irradiation. They found with increasing level of irradiation, four nutrients showed little or no change. Those nutrients include vitamins B9, E, K, and the carotenoid neoxanthin. This study showed the irradiation of packaged spinach to have little or no change to the nutritional value of the crop, and the health benefits of irradiating packed spinach to reduce harmful bacteria seem to outweigh the loss of nutrients.|$|E

25|$|Some non-eusocial insects also <b>sanitize</b> their nests: {{the wood}} {{cockroach}} (Cryptocercus punctulatus) commonly defecates within the nest (this species nests in decaying wood, which often {{has a high}} microbe density), and faeces {{have been found to}} have antifungal activity against M. anisopliae, possibly mediated by microbes. The galleries constructed within spruce trees by spruce beetles (Dendroctonus rufipennis) are under threat from multiple species of fungus which reduce spruce beetle fitness. Upon fungal invasion, adults begin secreting orally and analysis of these secretions has revealed bacteria with antifungal activity; faecal pellets are used to quarantine off fungally-infested sections of the gallery. A waste management strategy exists in some group living and subsocial species, such as the subsocial De Geer's short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus muticus). 5–10 minutes after defecating and returning to her eggs, A. muticus females return to the fecal pellets and removes them out of the chamber — note no other items are removed from the chamber. Upon discovering a carcass, subsocial N. vespilloides parents upregulate the anitmicrobial activity of their anal exudates and smear them over the carcass - thus sanitizing the resource their brood will soon feast on.|$|E

40|$|Small {{and very}} small {{slaughterhouses}} generally spray lactic acid for carcass decontamination utilizing a hand held sprayer. Even though this tool represents {{a very small}} investment, it may present important disadvantages such as uneven delivery of the spray over the carcass surface. If the decontamination treatment is not applied properly, the untreated areas of the carcass will still have high bacterial loads present and could be a source for recontamination of the areas that have been treated. A sanitizer spraying system (<b>sanitizing</b> halo system) was designed and assembled. The <b>sanitizing</b> halo system was tested at the Rosenthal Meat Science and Technology Center, Texas A&M University. Thirteen carcasses were split in halves. Thirteen halves were sampled and used as control after knife trimming and water wash; then they were sprayed with 2 % L-Lactic at 55 ????C with the <b>sanitizing</b> halo system. The other 13 halves were sprayed by the RMSTC employees utilizing a hand held sprayer. Counts of aerobic and mesophilic bacteria obtained from carcasses sprayed with the <b>sanitizing</b> halo system and the hand held sprayer were both {{significantly lower than the}} control counts. In addition, coliforms counts were below the detectable limit for the <b>sanitizing</b> halo system and the hand held sprayer. After testing, the <b>sanitizing</b> halo system was installed at two small commercial slaughter plants processing beef and pork carcasses. At each slaughter plant, 24 carcass halves were treated with 2 % L-Lactic at 55 ????C using the <b>sanitizing</b> halo system, and the other 24 halves were used as control. Mesophilic bacteria populations were reduced in beef and pork carcasses by 2. 9 and 1. 9 log cycles, respectively, after the lactic acid treatment. Also E. coli counts were significantly lower in the three regions sampled after application of the 2 % L-Lactic acid with the <b>sanitizing</b> halo system. From the data collected during this study, we recommend the <b>sanitizing</b> halo system as a tool to reduce the bacterial loads on the surface of beef and pork carcasses. The use of this system should help small and very small slaughterhouses to improve food safety performance while providing cost-efficiency, simplicity, and convenience...|$|R
