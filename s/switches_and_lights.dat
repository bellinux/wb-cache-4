25|$|In the past, grain {{elevators}} sometimes experienced silo explosions. Fine powder {{from the}} millions of grains passing through the facility would accumulate and mix with the oxygen in the air. A spark could spread from one floating particle to the other creating a chain reaction that would destroy the entire structure. (This dispersed-fuel explosion is the mechanism behind fuel-air bombs.) To prevent this, elevators have very rigorous rules against smoking or any other open flame. Many elevators also have various devices installed to maximize ventilation, safeguards against overheating in belt conveyors, legs, bearing, and explosion-proof electrical devices such as electric motors, <b>switches,</b> <b>and</b> <b>lighting.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} computers did {{not support}} interactive input/output devices, often relying on sense <b>switches</b> <b>and</b> <b>lights</b> {{to communicate with the}} computer operator. This was adequate for batch systems that ran one program at a time, often with the programmer acting as operator. This also had the advantage of low overhead, since lights and switches could be tested and set with one machine instruction. Later a single system console was added to allow the operator to communicate with the system.|$|E

The System Building Blocks are packaged into several 19-inch racks. The racks are themselves packaged {{into a single}} large mainframe case, with a hexagonal control panel containing <b>switches</b> <b>and</b> <b>lights</b> mounted to lie at table-top height {{at one end of}} the mainframe.

5000|$|A typical {{hardware}} configuration {{consisted of a}} panel with toggle <b>switches</b> <b>and</b> <b>lights</b> to enter the boot loader, and a Teletype writer to input operating system commands, a punched card reader that gravity feed the cards (they dropped into the read station, and were ejected and turned 180 degrees and then placed in the exit hopper), 2 655 disc drives, and a printer that printed about 600 lines per minutes. The boot loader and peripherals were usually on punched cards, which notified the operating system which devices to use via a PAL (Peripheral Availability List) entry cards. The [...] "go" [...] command to the operating system was infamous: [...] "EE" [...] control-G (bell).|$|E
5000|$|The {{period from}} about 1971 to 1976 is {{sometimes}} called the [...] of microcomputers. Many companies such as DEC, National Semiconductor, Texas Instruments offered their microcomputers for use in terminal control, peripheral device interface control and industrial machine control. There were also machines for engineering development and hobbyist personal use. In 1975, the Processor Technology SOL-20 was designed, which consisted of one board which included all {{the parts of the}} computer system. The SOL-20 had built-in EPROM software which eliminated the need for rows of <b>switches</b> <b>and</b> <b>lights.</b> The MITS Altair just mentioned played an instrumental role in sparking significant hobbyist interest, which itself eventually led to the founding and success of many well-known personal computer hardware and software companies, such as Microsoft and Apple Computer. Although the Altair itself was only a mild commercial success, it helped spark a huge industry.|$|E
50|$|The PDP-1 was {{supplied}} standard with 4096 {{words of}} core memory, 18-bits per word, and ran at a basic speed of 100,000 operations per second. It was constructed using many System Building Blocks that were packaged into several 19-inch racks. The racks were themselves packaged {{into a single}} large mainframe case, with a hexagonal control panel containing <b>switches</b> <b>and</b> <b>lights</b> mounted to lay at table-top height {{at one end of}} the mainframe. Above the control panel was the system's standard input/output solution, a punch tape reader and writer. Most systems were purchased with two peripherals, the Type 30 vector graphics display, and a Soroban Engineering modified IBM Model B Electric typewriter that was used as a printer. The Soroban system was notoriously unreliable, and often replaced with a modified Friden Flexowriter, which also contained its own punch tape system. A variety of more-expensive add-ons followed, including magnetic tape systems, punched card readers and punches, and faster punch tape and printer systems.|$|E
50|$|Lamps are {{available}} that {{conform to the}} physical specifications for H1, {{but not to the}} regulated specifications for power consumption, light output, and/or light colour. These include high-wattage lamps, and those that emit light of a colour outside the white or selective yellow specification ranges. Such lamps are illegal throughout the industrialised world for use in regulated automotive <b>lighting</b> devices, <b>and</b> so vehicle wiring, <b>switches,</b> <b>and</b> <b>lighting</b> components are generally not designed or built to withstand the higher heat and power consumption from off-spec lamps. Lamps with higher-than-specified output can also create unsafe levels of glare. There is considerable variability by jurisdiction in the regulation of off-road applications of lamp types used in on-road vehicles.|$|R

5000|$|Development of the single-chip {{microprocessor}} was {{an enormous}} catalyst to the popularization of cheap, easy to use, and truly personal computers. The Altair 8800, introduced in a Popular Electronics magazine article in the January 1975 issue, at the time set a new low price point for a computer, bringing computer ownership to an admittedly select market in the 1970s. This {{was followed by the}} IMSAI 8080 computer, with similar abilities and limitations. The Altair and IMSAI were essentially scaled-down minicomputers and were incomplete: to connect a keyboard or teleprinter to them required heavy, expensive [...] "peripherals". These machines both featured a front panel with <b>switches</b> <b>and</b> <b>lights,</b> which communicated with the operator in binary. To program the machine after switching it on the bootstrap loader program had to be entered, without error, in binary, then a paper tape containing a BASIC interpreter loaded from a paper-tape reader. Keying the loader required setting a bank of eight switches up or down and pressing the [...] "load" [...] button, once for each byte of the program, which was typically hundreds of bytes long. The computer could run BASIC programs once the interpreter had been loaded.|$|E
5000|$|Heathkit's H8 is an Intel 8080-based {{microcomputer}} sold {{in kit form}} {{starting in}} 1977. The H8 {{was similar to the}} S-100 bus computers of the era, and like those machines was often used with the CP/M operating system on floppy disk. The main difference between the H8 and S-100 machines was the bus; the H8 used a 50-pin bus design that was smaller, more robust and better engineered electrically. The machine also included a bootstrap ROM that made it easier to start up, including code for running basic input/output and allowing input through a front-mounted octal keypad and front panel display instead of the binary <b>switches</b> <b>and</b> <b>lights</b> used on machines like the Altair 8800. The H8 was a successful design but required a separate terminal to be truly useful; Heathkit introduced several terminals as well. A successor model, the [...] "All-in-One" [...] Heathkit H89, combined a Z-80 processor board and a floppy disk drive into the cabinet of an Heathkit H19 terminal. This model also was sold in fully assembled form as the WH89. These were later sold by Zenith Electronics with their name on the front as the Zenith Z-89.|$|E

40|$|An Optical Network-on-Chip(ONoC) {{based on}} silicon {{photonics}} {{is one of}} promising technology for next generation exascale computing architectures.

40|$|In situ {{electron}} spin resonance (ESR) studies have been performed on composite films consisting of a ruthenium tris(bipyridyl) complex and an inherently conducting polymer, poly(2 -methoxyaniline- 5 -sulfonic acid) (PMAS). The composites were investigated under white <b>light</b> irradiation <b>and</b> potential control conditions to probe photoinduced electron transfer between the ruthenium metal center and the conducting polymer. PMAS exhibited a clear ESR signal, characteristic {{of the presence of}} mobile single spin polarons within the polymer structure. Irradiation of the PMAS {{in the presence of the}} ruthenium metal center resulted in the photo-oxidation of the Ru 2 + to the Ru 3 + state, as a result of which the PMAS ESR signal was replaced by a response typical of the Ru 3 + salt. Upon removal of the illumination, reversible photo switching occurred. This reversibility makes these novel composites promising for applications in areas such as chemical sensors, <b>light</b> <b>switching,</b> <b>and</b> <b>light</b> harvesting devices...|$|R
