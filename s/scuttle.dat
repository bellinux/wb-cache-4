5|$|In early August 1914, Cordelia and {{the rest}} of her {{squadron}} were among the ships dispatched to hunt for the German commerce raider , which was trying to return to Germany. Although the squadron did not find her, the German ship was forced to <b>scuttle</b> herself by other British cruisers on 9 August to avoid being captured.|$|E
5|$|Model's true {{opinion on}} the value of the {{offensive}} remains unclear. Manstein took his recommendation at face value, while Guderian said that he was categorically against attacking. It has similarly been suggested that Model, in fact, hoped to <b>scuttle</b> the operation by causing it to be delayed until the Soviet forces launched their own attack.|$|E
5|$|Ariel, a sixteen-year-old mermaid princess, is {{dissatisfied}} with underwater {{life in the}} kingdom of Atlantica, and is curious about the human world. With her best friend Flounder, Ariel collects human artifacts in her grotto, and often goes {{to the surface of the}} ocean to visit <b>Scuttle,</b> a seagull who offers very inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She ignores the warnings of her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, and Sebastian, a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden.|$|E

5|$|In {{front of}} around 60 students, Bayliss stimulated the nerves with {{electricity}} {{for half an}} hour, {{but was unable to}} demonstrate his point. The dog was then handed to a student, Henry Dale, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's pancreas, then killed him with a knife through the heart. This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's laboratory assistant, Charles <b>Scuttle,</b> testified that the dog had been killed with chloroform or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony Dale told the court that he had, in fact, used a knife.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2006, an RAAF F-111 {{was chosen}} to <b>scuttle</b> the North Korean ship Pong Su which had been {{involved}} in one of Australia's largest drug hauls in recorded history. The ship had been sitting in Snails Bay, off Birchgrove, while the government considered its fate, and it was decided in March 2006 it would be scuttled by air attack. The Pong Su was sunk on 23 March 2006 by two GBU-10 Paveway II laser-guided bombs.|$|E
5|$|König was interned, {{along with}} the {{majority}} of the High Seas Fleet, in Scapa Flow in November 1918 following the Armistice. On 21 June 1919, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter gave the order to <b>scuttle</b> the fleet, including König, while the British guard ships were out of the harbor on exercises. Unlike most of the scuttled ships, König was never raised for scrapping; the wreck is still {{on the bottom of the}} bay.|$|E

5|$|Lycoperdon echinatum can {{be found}} either solitary or in small groups. It {{typically}} grows {{on the ground in}} deciduous forests and grassy areas, glades and pastures, on moss, humus, or woody debris. The fungus has been noted to have a preference for beech woods. Fruit bodies may make their appearance anytime from the late spring to autumn. Older specimens {{are more likely to be}} overlooked, as their brown color blends into the surrounding environment of dead leaves and dead wood. The puffball is used by various species of <b>scuttle</b> flies (family Phoridae) as larval food.|$|E
5|$|Other {{defensive}} {{strategies are}} {{the use of}} camouflage, fleeing, and aggression. Some species have adopted colourings, shapes, and patterns that {{make it difficult for}} predators that hunt by sight to detect them. They tend to be dull shades of brown, grey, and green that blend into their background, and desert species tend to be pale. Some species can fly, but the mode of flight tends to be clumsy, so the most usual response to danger is to <b>scuttle</b> away to find a hiding place.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fictional setting called Sequin Land, {{described}} as a magical place, formerly protected by Guardian Genies who won the land years of peace. With time, genies fell in love with humans and had children with them, half-genies with limited magical powers. For obscure reasons, genies ultimately vanished, with their children taking their place as protectors of the land. The main character, Shantae, is one such half-genie, appointed as the Guardian Genie of the small fishing village of <b>Scuttle</b> Town, where she resides in the abandoned lighthouse.|$|E

5|$|The scuttling of the German fleet {{took place}} at the Royal Navy's base at Scapa Flow, in Scotland, after the First World War. The High Seas Fleet was interned there {{under the terms of the}} Armistice whilst {{negotiations}} took place over the fate of the ships. Fearing that all of the ships would be seized and divided amongst the allied powers, the German commander, Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, decided to <b>scuttle</b> the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Ariel first {{appears in}} The Little Mermaid (1989), {{in which she}} is shown as being adventurous and curious about the world of humans, a fascination which angers both her father King Triton and his court {{composer}} Sebastian, as merfolk {{are not allowed to}} make contact with the human world. She and Flounder go in search of human objects, which they take to a seagull named <b>Scuttle</b> for appraisal. Ariel {{falls in love with a}} human prince named Prince Eric after saving him from drowning, and visits the sea witch, Ursula, who agrees to turn her into a human in exchange for her voice. Ariel must make Prince Eric fall in love with her and romantically kiss her within three days, lest she belong to Ursula forever.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Deutschland and Admiral Graf Spee were deployed to the Atlantic {{to put them in}} position to attack Allied merchant traffic once war was declared. Admiral Scheer remained in port for periodic maintenance. Deutschland was not particularly successful on her raiding sortie, during which she sank or captured three ships. She then returned to Germany where she was renamed Lützow. Admiral Graf Spee sank nine vessels in the South Atlantic before she was confronted by three British cruisers at the Battle of the River Plate. Although she damaged the British ships severely, she was herself damaged and her engines were in poor condition. Coupled with false reports of British reinforcements, the state of the ship convinced Hans Langsdorff, her commander, to <b>scuttle</b> the ship outside Montevideo.|$|E
50|$|In December 1991, {{two more}} California sea lion pups were born. Sinka {{gave birth to}} <b>Scuttles,</b> {{followed}} by Keel, born to Kline.

25|$|Several {{entities}} {{have called}} for the ship to be <b>scuttled</b> as a dive wreck. Federal Member of Parliament Keith Pitt has spent several years campaigning for the <b>scuttling</b> of a warship in Hervey Bay as a tourist attraction, with Tobruk his preferred vessel. Another proposal {{has come from the}} community of St Helens, Tasmania, for the ship to be sunk in Skeleton Bay. The Gold Coast has also expressed interest. On 2 December 2016 it was announced that Tobruk will be <b>scuttled</b> off the Fraser Coast, at a location halfway between Hervey Bay and Fraser Island. The <b>scuttling</b> is planned to take place by late 2018.|$|R
5|$|Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906–1921 {{reports that}} the Italian steamer , one of the convoyed ships, rammed and damaged U-16, causing U-16s crew to <b>scuttle</b> their ship due to the {{severity}} of the damage. Uboat.net's U-Boat War in World War I reports that Nembo herself rammed U-16 before going down, while Robert Grant and Gordon Smith give another possible fate for U-16: that Nembos depth charges detonated and sank the submarine while Nembo was sinking. Smith reports that 11 men aboard U-16, including her commanding officer von Zopa, lost their lives in the sinking, and that two survivors were picked up. U-16 was the only boat of her class to be sunk during the war.|$|E
5|$|First Officer Hans Oels {{ordered the}} men below decks to abandon ship; he {{instructed}} {{the engine room}} crews to open the ship's watertight doors and prepare scuttling charges. Gerhard Junack, the chief engineering officer, ordered his men to set the demolition charges with a 9-minute fuse but the intercom system broke down and he sent a messenger to confirm the order to <b>scuttle</b> the ship. The messenger never returned and Junack primed the charges and ordered the crew to abandon the ship. Junack and his comrades heard the demolition charges detonate {{as they made their}} way up through the various levels. Oels rushed throughout the ship, ordering men to abandon their posts. After he reached the deck a huge explosion killed him and about a hundred others.|$|E
5|$|Following the French {{surrender}} on 22 June, the French fleet {{was to be}} disarmed under German and Italian supervision, {{under the}} terms of the Armistice. The British high command, however, was concerned that the French ships would be seized by the Axis powers and placed in service. The Axis navies would then outnumber the British Royal Navy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice Admiral James Somerville, the commander of Force H, to neutralise the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir. He was instructed to order the French vessels to join the British with the Free French, surrender for internment, to <b>scuttle</b> themselves, or be sunk. On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum; the French rejected it, and so the British ships opened fire.|$|E

5000|$|Nineteen days later, on 8 May 1932, {{she reached}} the {{anchorage}} immediately off Semaphore in Adelaide. It was estimated that she was damaged beyond repair, so everything valuable on her was removed and shipped to Mariehamn on Herzogin Cecilie in December 1932. She was sold to the Waratah Gypsum Company for <b>scuttling</b> as a breakwater. [...] In January 1933, Wato towed her to Stenhouse Bay for <b>scuttling.</b> She was <b>scuttled</b> there on 8 January 1933.|$|R
5000|$|The United States {{undertook}} Operation Davy Jones' Locker between June 1946 and August 1948 and {{it involved}} the <b>scuttling</b> of eleven ships containing between 30,000 and 40,000 tons of captured German chemical weapons. [...] Nine {{of the ships}} were <b>scuttled</b> in Skagerrak Strait in the Baltic Sea while two more were sunk in the North Sea.

5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany in November 1918, the Allies interned {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow. The fleet rendezvoused {{with the}} British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive fleet consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. That morning, the Grand Fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and while they were away Reuter issued the order to <b>scuttle</b> the High Seas Fleet.|$|E
5|$|In August 1942, the Allies {{succeeded in}} {{repelling}} a second attack against El Alamein and, {{at a high}} cost, managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta. A few months later, the Allies commenced an attack of their own in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya. This attack was followed up shortly after by Anglo-American landings in French North Africa, {{which resulted in the}} region joining the Allies. Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by ordering the occupation of Vichy France; although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to <b>scuttle</b> their fleet to prevent its capture by German forces. The now pincered Axis forces in Africa withdrew into Tunisia, which was conquered by the Allies in May 1943.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty. Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to <b>scuttle</b> his ships. British sailors boarded Frankfurt and beached her before she could sink.|$|E
5000|$|Ships are {{increasingly}} being <b>scuttled</b> {{as a method of}} disposal. The economic benefit of <b>scuttling</b> a ship includes removal of ongoing operational expense to keep the vessel seaworthy. Controversy surrounds the practice. Notable actions against the practice include the USS Oriskany, which was <b>scuttled</b> with 700 pounds of PCBs remaining on board as a component in cable insulation, [...] contravening the Stockholm Convention on safe disposal of persistent organic pollutants, which has zero tolerance for PCB dumping in marine environments. The planned <b>scuttling</b> of the Australian frigate [...] at Avoca Beach, New South Wales in March 2010 was placed on hold after resident action groups aired concerns about possible impact on the area's tides and that the removal of dangerous substances from the ship was not thorough enough. Further cleanup work on the hulk was ordered, and despite further attempts to delay, Adelaide was <b>scuttled</b> on 13 April 2011.|$|R
