The {{hearing sensitivity}} of the big brown bat decreases before each sonar pulse is emitted and then recovers in a logarithmic fashion {{to compensate for the}} two-way transmission loss of sonar returns, thereby maintaining a constant echo sensation level over a distance of about 1.5 meters. This is functionally important to the bat, as it stabilizes the bat's estimate of echo arrival time, its cue for target distance.|$|E

40|$|Silent sonars are {{designed}} to reduce the distance over which their sounding pulses can be detected by intercept sonars. In order to meet this objective, we can use periodical sounding signals that have low power, a very long duration and wide spectrum. If used in the silent <b>sonar’s</b> <b>receiver,</b> matched filtration ensures very good detection of motionless or slow moving targets. However, {{it is more difficult}} to detect echo signals of fast moving targets with Doppler effect causing significant error in target distance measurements. In an effort to find signals that can better resist Doppler effect, maximum length sequence was tested for its application in silent sonar. It has an elementary signal which includes linear frequency modulation.

40|$|Beamforming is {{a signal}} {{processing}} technique by which {{an array of}} receivers sensitive to signals from all directions can be processed to form one larger more sensitive receiver that can identify which direction signals originate. Conventional beamforming methods can allow signals from noisy interferers to mask signals of interest if these interferers lie close to those directions to which the beamformer is sensitive. Adaptive beamforming (ABF) attempts to overcome this by minimizing the beamformer’s output subject to certain constraints.

40|$|Echolocating bats emit {{ultrasonic}} vocalizations {{and listen}} to echoes reflected back from objects {{in the path of}} the sound beam to build a spatial representation of their surroundings. Important to understanding the representation of space through echolocation are detailed studies of the cues used for localization, the sonar emission patterns and how this information is assembled. This thesis includes three studies, one on the directional properties of the <b>sonar</b> <b>receiver,</b> one on the directional properties of the sonar transmitter, and a model that demonstrates the role of action in building a representation of auditory space. The general importance of this work to a broader understanding of spatial localization is discussed. Investigations of the directional properties of the <b>sonar</b> <b>receiver</b> reveal that interaural level difference and monaural spectral notch cues are both dependent on sound source azimuth and elevation. This redundancy allows flexibility that an echolocating bat may need when coping with complex computational demands for sound localization. Using a novel method to measure bat sonar emission patterns from freely behaving bats, I show that the sonar beam shape varies between vocalizations. Consequently, the auditory system of a bat may need to adapt its computations to accurately localize objects using changing acoustic inputs. Extra-auditory signals that carry information about pinna position and beam shape are required for auditory localization of sound sources. The auditory system must learn associations between extra-auditory signals and acoustic spatial cues. Furthermore, the auditory system must adapt to changes in acoustic input that occur with changes in pinna position and vocalization parameters. These demands on the nervous system suggest that sound localization is achieved through the interaction of behavioral control and acoustic inputs. A sensorimotor model demonstrates how an organism can learn space through auditory-motor contingencies. The model also reveals how different aspects of sound localization, such as experience-dependent acquisition, adaptation, and extra-auditory influences, can be brought together under a comprehensive framework. This thesis presents a foundation for understanding the representation of auditory space that builds upon acoustic cues, motor control, and learning dynamic associations between action and auditory inputs...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} to rejecting interference between sonar systems is presented in this paper. The approach is based on identifying a transmitter by sending a double pulse with known separation. Using simple delayed pulse subtraction, a <b>sonar</b> <b>receiver</b> can test echo pulses quickly and simply for acceptance. This approach is implemented on a sonar system {{that is capable of}} accurately tracking objects at measurement rates exceeding 10 Hz. Two sonar sensors, each consisting of a transmitter and two receivers, are independently controlled to track objects from bearing and range measurements. Matched filtering is used to optimally estimate echo arrival times from which range and bearing angle are derived. Bearing accuracy is typically better than 0. 1 degrees but degrades if there is air turbulence and temperature gradients. Bearing errors are shown experimentally to have significant autocorrelation at times of the order of seconds. The ability to reliably reject interference is demonstrated expe [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In {{active sonar}} systems, {{detection}} {{is the process}} of deciding if a target echo is present in a return. This is often accomplished by an operator who examines the <b>sonar</b> <b>receiver</b> output and decides if any portion of it is larger than the expected response due to reverberation. Detection may also be ac-complished automatically using a processor that sets a threshold based on a sampling of the receiver output. In this report, a detection processor developed under the task NAV 99 / 027 is presented for use in active sonar systems that process returns incoherently. The statistics of the receiver output of such a system follows the two-parameter gamma probability density function (PDF). Consequently, the detection processor computes the detection threshold as a non-linear function of the ratio of two ranked values of the receiver output. The result is a detection processor that exhibits a false alarm probability that is bounded within ten percent of a design value regardless of the values of the gamma PDF parameters...|$|E

Time of flight of the sonar echoes allows the calculation of {{the distance of the}} target. The orientation can be estimated from knowledge of the beam pattern of the receivers and the ratio, in the frequency domain, between the emitted and the received signals after compensation for distance effects and air absorption. The localization method is described and, as its performance strongly depends on the beam pattern, the search of the most appropriate <b>sonar</b> <b>receiver</b> in order to ensure the highest accuracy of target orientation estimations is developed in this paper. The structure designs considered are inspired by the ear shapes of some bat species.

40|$|Sonobuoy fields, {{consisting}} of many distributed emitter and <b>receiver</b> <b>sonar</b> sensors on buoys, {{are used to}} seek and track underwater targets in a defined search area. A sensor scheduling algorithm is {{required in order to}} optimise tracking performance by selecting which emitter sonobuoy should transmit in each time interval, and which waveform it should use. In this paper we describe a new long term sensor scheduling algorithm for sonobuoy fields, called the continuous probability states algorithm. This algorithm reduces the scheduling search space by keeping track of the probability that a target is undetected, rather than modelling all possible detection outcomes, which reduces the computation complexity of the algorithm. It is shown that this approach results in high quality tracking for multiple targets in a simulated sonobuoy field...|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustic}} modelling in TNO’s ALMOST (=Acoustic Loss Model for Operational Studies and Tasks) uses {{a bubble}} migration model as realistic input for wake modelling. The modelled bubble cloud represents the actual ship wake. Ship hull, propeller and bow wave {{are the main}} generators of bubbles in the wake. The bubble volume originates from the wake velocity field, combined with properties and physical processes of air bubbles in water. The bubble volume {{is assumed to be}} insonified by a generic active forward looking sonar. The resulting back-scattered sound is modelled with the recently developed ALMOST-REATES module (=Range Estimator for Active sonar and Target Echo Strength). It takes into account bubble scattering spectra and positions, and other important factors for the echo signal, like propagation loss from sonar transmitter and back to <b>sonar</b> <b>receiver,</b> beam forming, and signal processing. The new method is a further development of the ALMOST-REACT module (=Range Estimator for ACTive sonar) : The active sonar equation is programmed here based on echo arrival times, computing sonar performance for point targets. The new method uses specified bubble positions, provided by the ship wake bubble migration model, to compute first the Impulse Response function. With the given spectrum of the active sonar pulse, the echo time series is modelled by simulating active sonar processing. Detection performance and an effective Target Strength for the scenario are deduced from this echo time series. The actual sonar processor is simulated, usually equipped with matched filter or straightforward energy detector. To run the model on a standard PC, the number of bubble positions is limited, while also the run time must be acceptable. The consequences of this limitation are reduced by applying some statistics in the modelling. Some results of echo structures and sonar performance are shown in a realistic active sonar scenario...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Interferometric sonars with {{multiple}} horizontal rows of elements {{have been used}} routinely to produce swath bathymetry. However, interferometric sonars are larger more complex, and consume more power than arrays with a single row of elements. Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) systems often {{require the use of}} redundant phase centers (RPC), where the aft sonar element positions overlap in space with the forward element positions of the previous ping. Considering that a vehicle carrying a SAS array would likely have non-zero pitch, the use of RPC provides <b>sonar</b> data from <b>receivers</b> at the same along-track position with some vertical displacement. This data {{is similar to that of}} interferometric systems with the exception that the distance between receiver pairs can vary with vehicle motion and the received signals are not collected concurrently. This paper evaluates the possibility that an interferometric capability could be achieved using RPC data collected from a SAS system consisting of a single horizontal row of elements. An error analysis was conducted to determine the effect of errors in relative receiver position on swath bathymetry. Results show that errors in receiver vertical displacement result in similar percent errors in elevation. Therefore, errors in swath bathymetry can be reduced by designing the array to increase vertical displacement between RPC pairs. Results also show that increasing vertical displacement between RPC pairs can also reduce the impact of data phase measurement errors on swath bathymetry. Swath bathymetry measurements are very sensitive to errors in across-track displacements, but the predictable nature and scale of the error may indicate that accurate across-track displacements could be calculated from phase measurements. Swath bathymetry images produced from data acquired by an existing SAS consisting of a single horizontal row of elements are shown and illustrate viability of the technique depending on the required resolution of the system.
