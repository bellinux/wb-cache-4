40|$|The use of maleic {{anhydride}} (MAH) modified and unmodified natural and synthetic trans- 1. 4 -isoprene rubber (TIR Gutta Percha and TIR <b>Synthetic)</b> as hot-melt <b>adhesives</b> for plywood manufacturing under various glue spread levels was investigated and their gluability and durability {{in accordance to}} SNI 01 - 5008. 2 - 99 standard were evaluated. TIR modified with MAH (MTIR) either natural (MTIR Gutta Percha) or <b>synthetic</b> (MTIR <b>Synthetic)</b> <b>adhesives</b> could reveal a satisfactory waterproof gluability. This {{is considered to be}} due to an enhanced adhesion caused by an occurrence of esterification between the hydroxyl groups of wood and the acid anhydride groups of MTIR during hot pressing. Infra red spectroscopic analysis showed both TIR Gutta Percha and TIR Synthetic have almost similar spectra. In the spectra of MTIR`s after purification, the peak at 1724 and at 1716 cm - 1, respectively for MTIR Synthetic and MTIR Gutta Percha existed, indicated the characteristic for C=O of MAH. Differential thermal analysis showed that before and after modified with MAH, the melting and decomposition temperatures of MTIR Gutta Percha and MTIR <b>Synthetic</b> <b>adhesives</b> were quite different from TIR Gutta Percha and TIR <b>Synthetic</b> <b>adhesives</b> indicated that chemical modification of TIR`s with MAH were occurred.

50|$|Gaffer tape is {{manufactured}} in many colors, including fluorescent and custom colors, {{but perhaps the}} most common variety is matte black. A matte finish keeps the tape from reflecting light so it blends in with a typical stage floor. It is sold in a variety of widths from 1/4 in to 4 in, with 1 in and 2 in being the most common. Gaffer tape is strong yet can be torn by hand, so no cutting tools are necessary, and it can easily be ripped into narrower strips when desired. The <b>synthetic</b> <b>adhesive</b> typically leaves little or no residue and will generally not damage most surfaces when it is removed. This is, however, more likely in warm conditions, so care must be used in considering whether a different type of tape would be more appropriate in a given application.
