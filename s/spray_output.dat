40|$|It is {{important}} in residual spraying programmes for malaria eradication that a uniform deposit of insecticide should {{be applied to the}} walls of dwellings. The uniformity of application with hand compression sprayers is greatly enhanced if a disk flow regulator is used, but this device has not been popular for field use as its properties alter after a few days' use. This study explains the mode of action of the device and discloses that swelling of the disk caused by the DDT formulation is the primary cause of the gradual reduction of output. The need for proper mating of the disk with the nozzle tip is explained, and the 9504 E-type tip is described as best suited for the desired <b>spray</b> <b>output.</b> Use of the disk flow regulator is recommended because it permits uniform spray application and reduces nozzle-tip erosion...|$|E
40|$|The {{fungicides}} {{application in}} Douro Region vineyards is on {{of the most}} expensive operation and one of lower efficiency. The use of conventional sprayers, having always the same <b>spray</b> <b>output,</b> makes that when the tractor- sprayer speed changes, some vine parts are overdosed and other underdosed. The use of DPA systems (debit proportional to the variable speed) correct this variation increasing or decreasing the sprayer pressure, keeping the output constant independently the speed variation. Using different situations (slopes, ploughed and non ploughed soil, nozzles sizes and spray pressure) trials were done to compare output variation with and without DPA system. For a output of 500 L/ha, different soil conditions, slopes varying from- 18 to 18 %, nozzles of 1. 0 and 1. 2 mm and spray pressure of 3 and 5 bars, the range variation with DPA were 494. 7 to 510. 7 L/ha and without from 405. 3 t...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{current state}} {{development}} and process evolution ofthermal spray technology during last century ( 1910 ― 2010 ) were reviewed. An "three―step evolution trend" (heat energy dominance, kineticenergy dominance, innovative idea and composite performance dominance) wasadvanced {{in order to}} get comprehensive understanding on this technology and dobetter in promoting its future development. Low pressure plasma spraying―thinfilm (LPPS―TF), cold spray (CS) and suspension orsolution srecursor plasma spray (SPS/SPPS) were selected among emerging novelspray processes to be briefly introduced from two aspects (process characteristics and potential applications). Comparison of <b>spray</b> <b>output</b> valueand detail contribution ratio distribution of various industry or process through world and Asia spray industry market were made to probe into what canbe improved as for China thermal spray industry in future.

50|$|Shotcrete {{machines}} are available which control the complete process {{and make it}} very fast and easy. Manual and mechanical methods are used for the wet spraying process but wet sprayed concrete is traditionally applied by machine. The high <b>spray</b> <b>outputs</b> and large cross-sections require the work to be mechanised. Concrete spraying systems with duplex pumps are mainly used for working with wet mixes. Unlike conventional concrete pumps, these systems have to meet the additional requirement of delivering a concrete flow that is as constant as possible, and therefore continuous, to guarantee homogeneous spray application'.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{dedicated}} to the effect of surface modification on lid warming of busbar trunking system BD 2 which is manufactured by Siemens company in Mohelnice town (CZ). By using experimental methods, it investigates heat transfer by radiation and natural convection. It evaluates which type of surface modification is more effective by transfer heat. This study uses a method of emisivity comparison and a procedure given in standards for heat up test afterwards. It led to recognition, that various colour shades used on busbar system have similar high emissivity. Smooth colour spraying transfers heat a bit more effectively than rough colour <b>spraying.</b> <b>Outputs</b> of supplementary measurements give basis for numerical simulations in SolidWorks software. Numerical analysis assists to interpret results, for example by sensitivity study of heat transfer depending on emissivity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The main aim of {{this paper}} is to image {{denoising}} by several algorithms published as of date and each approach has its assumptions, advantages, and limitations. Based nature of <b>sprays,</b> <b>output</b> images of spray-based methods shows noise with unknown statistical distribution. The noise reduction method is based on the assumption that the non-enhanced image is either free of noise or affected by non-perceivable levels of noise. This paper focuses on noise removal methodologies in images with an insight in the area of denoising. The denoising performance of the wavelet based shrinkage methods are compared in terms of structural similarity index, peak signal to noise ratio, image enhancement factor and the most recent measure namely multiscale structural similarity index. This is an initiative to study and analyze different variants of denoising techniques to improve their performance. In this paper a detailed survey has been carried out on various image denoising approaches and their performances on natural images were analyzed.

40|$|A {{commercial}} air-assisted sprayer {{was tested}} in asparagus crop using a water-soluble food dye as a tracer. The machine had been modified {{by lowering the}} nozzles and the air outlets by 20 cm, in order to match more close by the geometry of the asparagus crop canopies and to improve deposition {{at the base of}} the stems. Several tests were performed to investigate how deposition was affected by various treatments, including: the number, position and size of the nozzles; the spray volume rate; the presence or absence of air assistance; the <b>spray</b> <b>output</b> angle, relative to the travel direction; and the forward speed. The most uniform deposition was obtained with: four nozzles per side (the lowest at a height of 46 cm from the ground), directed horizontally; an air flow rate of 6. 1 m(3) /s; and a forward speed of 1. 69 m/s. This adjustment was eventually compared with the standard sprayer setting, showing that total deposition on the canopy could be increased from 48. 4 to 65. 6 % of the dose applied, without substantially increasing spray losses to the ground.

40|$|By definition, {{spray drift}} is {{composed}} of applied pesticide that has failed to reach the intended target. Most sprayers treat an entire area with little consideration for or ability to adapt to target or environmental conditions. Sensing and control systems for agricultural sprayers can reduce spray drift by adjusting the <b>spray</b> <b>output</b> to focus deposition exclusively on targets, compensate for variable environmental conditions or alter the application rate in accordance with a priori knowledge of the crop or other target. Technology and techniques for such applications is generally referred to as “precision agriculture”. In this paper, the term “precision application ” refers to technologies and strategies where broadcast application of agrochemicals is replaced by targeted application and / or control of the application based on sensing of environmental conditions. Specific examples include target detection systems for field and orchard crops, droplet size and rate control systems and selective application systems that allow reduction or elimination of chemicals with potential drift concerns. Sensing and control systems can significantly reduce the applied rate of pesticide while maintaining target deposition levels necessary for efficacious pest control. Order-of- magnitude reductions can be achieved under some conditions while 25 – 50 % reductions in are present {{at the time of}} treatment. Examples include selective control of emerged weeds and foliar applications of insecticides and fungicides when crop plants are sparse or exhibit spatial non-uniformity. The systems require sensors, algorithms and spray system actuators with fast response times and high spatial resolution. “Spot spray ” systems are examples of the sense-and-treat approach. Map-based control is often used for application of pre-emergent herbicides and crop nutrients on spatial scales limited by GPS accuracy or width of individually-controllable spray boom sections. In these systems, sensing and treatment chemical rate can be routinely achieved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The 35 t/h boiler {{used in the}} Thermal Power Plant of Tangshan Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. is a chain furnace. Its {{control system}} of the conmbustion process is a 2 input- 2 output system whose inputs are the {{quantity}} of the fuel and desuperheater <b>spray,</b> <b>outputs</b> are the steam pressure and the steam temperature. Due to the nonlinearity, large lag, and coupling impact between the input and output parameters, fuzzy control was introduced. The fuzzy control rule has the adjustable factors and is described by the analytic relationships. The steam pressure is a 2 -level control, including the original and final control. In the final control, {{the effect of the}} fuel quantity change on the steam temperature is taken into consideration. Thus the correction of the steam temperature for the fuel quantity is introduced. The control rule can be adjusted on-line owing to the regulable factors. For the reason, the control is closer to the actual production, which makes the production more smooth and reliable. Lastly, the modular structural design by means of PLC makes the realization of the fuzzy control algorithm more convenient...|$|R
40|$|Removal of Noise in {{the image}} is {{challenging}} task in Image processing. Now-a-days {{there are so many}} methods that are available to remove noise from digital images. This introduced noise by image enhancement methods, in particular algorithms based on the random spray sampling technique, but not only. According to the nature of <b>sprays,</b> <b>output</b> images of spray-based methods tend to exhibit noise with unknown statistical distribution. Most of the novel method comprises two stages: the first stage is to detect the noise {{in the image}}. At this stage, based on the intensity values, the pixels are roughly divided into “noise-free pixel ” and “noisy pixel”. Then, the second stage is to eliminate the noise from the image. At this stage, only the “noise-pixels ” are processed. Some methods proposed to remove noise in the Image based on Contourlet-Domain HMT Models Using Cycle Spinning, Spatio-Temporal Retinex inspired Envelope with Stochastic Sampling (STRESS) used in gray scale images, steerable pyramid domain based on a local Laplace prior, Dual-tree Complex Wavelet Transform based denoising for Random Spray image enhancement methods, Adaptive Shrinkage for Image Denoising Based on Contourlet Transform. But these are some disadvantages in them. KEYWORDS...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods for}} the {{collection}} of capillary electrophoresis fractions for analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization have been investigated; the first using a novel ion-porous Joint design for dropwise fraction collection and the second, a process of electrospray deposition, Sensitivity shot-to-shot reproducibility, effect of matrix preparation and influence of buffer additives encountered in micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECC) have been examined using a standard peptide, methionine enkephalin. The direct collection of droplets from the capillary outlet was found to give a superior signal intensity, whereas the electrospray method, in its first stage of development, suffered through dilution effects and excessively wide sample distribution. The target compound was successfully collected by electrospray deposition and results indicated that signal intensity and sample homogeneity would be enhanced if the <b>sprayed</b> <b>output</b> could be collected into the sample wells in its entirety, The advantage of using electrospray deposition for the preparation of matrix layers followed by direct droplet collection onto the electrosprayed matrix was clearly demonstrated by improvements in both sensitivity and shot-to-shot variance In signal intensity across the sample well compared with collection onto spotted matrix, In addition, compatibility of the droplet collection method with MECC was illustrated by {{the recovery of the}} compound of interest from a buffer containing 30 mM sodium dodecyl sulphate.

40|$|The spray {{characteristics}} of pneumatic atomizers are examined using hot film anemometry. Measurements of drop size distribution, concentration profile and drop frequency {{are carried out}} over wide ranges of relative position between air peripheral jet exit and the concentric water nozzle exit. The objective is to clarify the role of turbulence in producing {{a wide spectrum of}} particle sizes and numbers in the <b>spray.</b> The <b>output</b> signal from hot film contained multispikes with different amplitudes and thickness which has been correlated to the drop number density and the droplet size through the use of probability density function. Generally it is found that an increase of the guide relative position enhances the mixing process and produces finer spray. This is attributed to the utilization of high wave number eddies in shortening the liquid jet break up length. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|An electronic, resistance-based {{sensor array}} and data {{acquisition}} system was developed to measure spray deposition from hydraulic nozzles. The sensor surface consisted of several parallel tin plated copper traces of varying widths with varying gap widths. The system contained an embedded microprocessor to monitor output voltage corresponding to spray deposition every second. In addition, a wireless module was used to transmit the voltage values to a remote laptop. Tests were conducted in two stages to evaluate {{the performance of the}} sensor array in an attempt to quantify the spray deposition. Initial tests utilized manual droplet placement on the sensor surface {{to determine the effects of}} temperature and droplet size on voltage output. Secondary testing utilized a spray chamber to pass nozzles at different speeds above the sensor surface to determine if output varied based on different application rates or spray droplet classification. Results from this preliminary analysis indicated that manual droplets of 5 and 10 μL resulted in significantly different values from the sensors while temperature did not consistently affect <b>output.</b> <b>Spray</b> chamber test results indicated that different application rates and droplet sizes could be determined using the sensor array...|$|R
