5|$|Cadmium electroplating, {{consuming}} 6% of {{the global}} production, {{is used in the}} aircraft industry to reduce corrosion of steel components. This coating is passivated by chromate salts. A limitation of cadmium plating is hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steels from the electroplating process. Therefore, <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> heat-treated to tensile strength above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement cadmium electroplating processes or physical vapor deposition).|$|E
50|$|Aluminium alloys {{typically}} have an elastic modulus of about 70 GPa, {{which is about}} one-third of the elastic modulus of most kinds of steel and steel alloys. Therefore, for a given load, a component or unit made of an aluminium alloy will experience a greater deformation in the elastic regime than a <b>steel</b> <b>part</b> of identical size and shape. Though there are aluminium alloys with somewhat-higher tensile strengths than the commonly used kinds of steel, simply replacing a <b>steel</b> <b>part</b> with an aluminium alloy might lead to problems.|$|R

5|$|The {{construction}} of the Stord Bridge was undertaken {{as part of the}} same contract as the Bømla Bridge, which was awarded in December 1998 to Triangle Contractors, a joint venture between NCC and HBG Steel Structures. Most of the work was carried out by NCC with HBG having responsibility for the <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> of the deck and the cables. HBG had previously built the steel for the Osterøy Bridge, which opened in 1997. The responsibility for the cables was given to Brown Beach Associates and Hordaland Mekaniske Verksted. Construction started on 20 February 1999. After the pylons were completed on 25 September 1999, two catwalks were erected between them, with the constructors choosing two continuous catwalks instead of three separate pairs. Extra stability to the catwalks was achieved by building connections between the two.|$|E
5|$|Armour {{has been}} {{employed}} in battles in Japan since the Yayoi period. Some {{of the oldest}} extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from kofun and have been designated as archaeological National Treasures. These ancient armours were of two types: a tight fitting solid plate cuirass (tankō) and a skirted lamellar type (keikō), both believed {{to be based on}} Chinese or Korean prototypes. This list includes more recent pieces of armour, developed as result of a trend toward (lamellar) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period (9th to 10th centuries). Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or <b>steel</b> <b>parts,</b> these armours had the advantage of being light, flexible, foldable and shock absorbent. They were generally lacquered to protect them from the humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century. A complete set consisted of a helmet, mask, neck guard, throat protector, breastplate with shoulder guards, sleeve armour, skirt, greaves, shoes and a pennant attached to the back.|$|E
25|$|The carbon {{can come}} from a solid, liquid or gaseous source; if {{it comes from a}} solid source the process is called pack carburizing. Packing low carbon <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> with a {{carbonaceous}} material and heating for some time diffuses carbon into the outer layers.

50|$|At {{temperatures}} below 1200 °C, {{a vacuum}} furnace {{is commonly used}} for the heat treatment of steel alloys. Many general heat treating applications involve the hardening and tempering of a <b>steel</b> <b>part</b> to make it strong and tough through service. Hardening involves heating the steel to a predetermined temperature, then cooling it rapidly.|$|R

25|$|Once {{the railway}} bridge was completed, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration {{took over the}} former bridge and rebuilt it wider and stronger. The entire {{superstructure}} and <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> of the pillars were demolished. The brick gates were widened. The auxiliary road past Tarris was placed on a viaduct leading to the bridge. To avoid hindering traffic on the river, construction was prolonged. A temporary wooden bridge was erected in 1936 and remained for two years, until the new road bridge opened in 1938.|$|E

25|$|The Tenifer process {{produces}} a matte gray-colored, nonglare {{surface with a}} 64 Rockwell C hardness rating and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications), making the Glock particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol concealed as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration. Glock <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> using the Tenifer treatment are more corrosion resistant than analogous gun parts having other finishes or treatments, including Teflon, bluing, hard chrome plating, or phosphates. During 2010 Glock switched from the salt bath nitriding Tenifer process to a not exactly disclosed gas nitriding process. After applying the nitriding process, a black Parkerized decorative surface finish is applied. The underlying nitriding treatment will remain, protecting these parts even if the decorative surface finish were to wear off.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of Gabilondo Ruby {{production}} {{are between}} 250,000 and 300,000 pistols in total. While most Gabilondo produced pistols were of good quality, others were less well made. French officials quickly {{became aware that}} few of the Spanish Ruby-types had interchangeable magazines, and insisted the manufacturers mark the base of all magazines. This was to prevent the possibly fatal consequence at {{the front line of}} either not being able to insert a new magazine, or having a loaded magazine detach from the gun in action. Many Ruby-types were plagued by poor finish and incorrectly hardened <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> which after a short period of use wore so badly that pistols fired on full-auto. On other pistols, the safety mechanism wore out. The good quality Rubies were reliable and accurate, although some users were disconcerted by the lack of a visible hammer. About 710,000 Ruby types were accepted by the French from all sources and by 1920, about 580,000 were still serviceable and in French army stores. Many other allied nations, and some of the new nations created after the War such as Finland and Yugoslavia also used Ruby-type pistols. Gabilondo ceased production in 1919 and switched to more advanced models, but other firms continued to produce the Ruby-type until the Great Depression wiped out many arms producers.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, NSB {{announced}} {{that they would be}} rebranding their services, and that commuter trains would be branded at NSB Puls. They would lose their traditional red color and instead be colored green and silver, with the Class 72 being the first trains to receive the new design. In February 2001, the first train arrived to Norway for testing. The delay was caused by errors in the drawings and the bankruptcy of a supplier. In April it was {{announced that}} the trains were too heavy to allow standing passengers, since the trains could then exceed the permitted axle weight. To reduce the weight, the trains needed to have some <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> replaced with aluminium. NSB stated that the situation was problematic both because they had calculated the need for standing places to handle rush-hour traffic, and because it was impossible for them to control if more people than there were seats for would board a train. NSB stated that part of the problem was that they could not order shelf ware, in part because the Norwegian loading gauge is wider than in Continental Europe. By September, a solution had been found whereby the weight had been reduced sufficiently that 350 standing passengers could be taken on each train. The trains were delivered with the train radio system Scanet, but the technology was so out of date that there was only a five-year warranty. At the time, it was uncertain when Global System for Mobile Communications – Railway (GSM-R) would be built for the Norwegian rail network, and NSB feared there could arise {{a situation in which the}} trains could not be used, if the construction were not accelerated.|$|E
