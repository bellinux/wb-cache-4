2500|$|Tay was sailing from Havana to Campeche, Mexico, when at 1 a.m. 11 November lookouts spotted {{breakers}} ahead, {{even though}} a sounding a few minutes earlier had found no ground at 20 fathoms. Although the helmsman was able to turn her, Tay slammed broadside into a coral reef; <b>she</b> <b>slammed</b> twice more before heeling over and filling with water. The crew fired distress guns, cut away her masts, launched boats, and manned the pumps. Daylight showed a rocky reef nearby. However, in trying [...] to reach it the boats swamped, causing one passenger, a Spaniard, to drown. Eventually the crew {{were able to use}} a raft to reach the rocks while hauling a hawser {{that the rest of the}} crew then used to escape the wreck. The next day the crew used the boats to salvage provisions and stores from the wreck and establish a camp on a nearby island. Lieutenant Henry Smithwick then sailed Tays yawl to the mainland in search of help.|$|E

2500|$|The {{wreck of}} Lusitania lies on her {{starboard}} side at an approximately 30-degree angle in [...] of sea water. She is severely collapsed onto her starboard side {{as a result}} of the force with which <b>she</b> <b>slammed</b> into the sea floor, and over decades, Lusitania has deteriorated significantly faster than Titanic because of the corrosion in the winter tides. The keel has an [...] "unusual curvature", in a boomerang shape, which may be related to a lack of strength from the loss of her superstructure. The beam is reduced with the funnels missing presumably to deterioration. The bow is the most prominent portion of the wreck with the stern damaged from depth charging in the Second World War as well as the removal of three of the four propellers by Oceaneering International in 1982. Some of the prominent features on Lusitania include her still-legible name, some bollards with the ropes still intact, pieces of the ruined promenade deck, some portholes, the prow and the remaining propeller. Recent expeditions to the wreck have revealed that Lusitania is in surprisingly poor condition compared to Titanic, as her hull has already started to collapse.|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Gaskell {{repeated}} Charlotte's {{words about}} Anne in The Life of Charlotte Brontë, {{claiming that the}} subject of The Tenant [...] "was painfully discordant to one who would fain have sheltered herself from all but peaceful and religious ideas". In his essay on Emily Brontë, Algernon Charles Swinburne briefly mentioned The Tenant {{in the context of}} Branwell's decline as a novel [...] "which deserves perhaps a little more notice and recognition than it has ever received" [...] and added that [...] "as a study of utterly flaccid and invertebrate immorality it bears signs of more faithful transcription from life than anything in Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights". [...] Margaret Oliphant believed that Anne [...] "would have no right to be considered at all as a writer but for her association with [...] imperative spirits". Mary Ward, a novelist, who was widely known for her anti-feminist views, in her introduction to 1900 edition of The Tenant, accused Anne of [...] "the narrowness of view" [...] and absence of [...] "some subtle, innate correspondence between eye and brain, between brain and hand, [...] was present in Emily and Charlotte". She concluded that [...] "it is not as the writer of 'Wildfell Hall', but as the sister of Charlotte and Emily Brontë, that Anne Brontë escapes oblivion". May Sinclair, while famously saying that [...] "when [...] slammed the door of Mrs. Huntingdon's bedroom <b>she</b> <b>slammed</b> it in the face of society and all existing moralities and conventions", considered that she [...] "had no genius". Sinclair wrote about The Tenant: [...] "There are scenes, there are situations, in Anne's amazing novel, which for sheer audacity stand alone in mid-Victorian literature, and which would hold their own in the literature of revolt that followed... Her diagnosis of certain states, her realization of certain motives, suggests Balzac rather than any of the Brontës". In her introduction to the 1914 edition of the novel Sinclair was also ambivalent about Anne and her novel — while acclaiming it as [...] "the first presentment of that Feminist novel", she stated that [...] "it bores to tears". Her opinion of Helen was also mixed: [...] "If Agnes Grey is a little prig, Helen Huntingdon is a prig enormous... She is Anne Bronte's idea of noble womanhood, the first of the modern, large-souled, intellectual heroines".|$|E

Overwhelmed by anger, {{she opens the door}} to the wardrobe.
