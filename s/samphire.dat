5|$|The suburb was {{originally}} three low lying islands that {{were covered in}} shell grit and saltbush and surrounded by mangrove and <b>samphire</b> swamps. Fishermen had established huts on the islands by 1865 and by 1873 there were 13 huts and a boathouse recorded when the area was surveyed by Thomas Evans. By the 1890s people were visiting the islands attracted to the supposed curative properties of the mangrove mud, using the beach for bathing and fishing for crabs.|$|E
5|$|Each year in {{late summer}} {{thousands}} of black swans and ducks descend on the area as the inland waterways they inhabit dry up. Waterbirds such as pelicans, cormorants, oyster catchers and terns are common often year round. Egrets, ibis, herons and spoonbills feed on the seagrass and fairy wrens, chats, fantails and thornbills feed on insects and plants amongst the <b>samphire.</b> Each September stints and sandpipers arrive from the Northern Hemisphere in a spectacular display. With the abundance of birdlife the area attracts birds of prey with swamp harriers, collared sparrowhawks, black-shouldered kites, kestrels and little falcons are all seen in the skies over St Kilda.|$|E
5|$|St Kilda is {{adjacent}} to the mangrove forest bordering Barker Inlet, part of the largest tidal estuary of Gulf St Vincent.

5|$|The menu at Pétrus {{is split}} into several fixed price menus, {{containing}} modern French cuisine. It {{has been described}} by Zoe Williams as being distinctly Gordon Ramsay in composition, despite the influences of head chef Sean Burbidge. The meals come with an amuse-bouche, a pre-starter course, and after dinner chocolates in addition to the items listed on the menus themselves. A number of pan fried fish dishes have been on the menu, including mackerel with tomato chutney and a niçoise salad, and a sea bream course served with brown shrimp, <b>samphire</b> and an oyster velouté sauce. Further seafood related dishes include a langoustine and watercress soup entrée which was praised by food critic Jay Rayner. Sauces are generally delivered to the table in small jugs and are poured tableside.|$|E
5|$|The white-winged fairywren is {{primarily}} insectivorous; its diet includes small beetles, bugs, moths, praying mantises, caterpillars, and smaller insects, including spiders. The larger insects are typically fed to nestlings by the breeding female and her helpers, including the breeding male. Adults and juveniles forage by hopping along the shrubland floor, and may supplement their diets with seeds and fruits of saltbush (Rhagodia), goosefoot (Chenopodium) and new shoots of <b>samphire.</b> During spring and summer, birds {{are active in}} bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during {{the heat of the}} day. Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the wild}} stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food {{products}} were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species {{of plants and animals}} were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh <b>samphire,</b> which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|E
40|$|This site {{comprised}} {{a mixture}} of supra tidal flats, which by definition {{are considered to be}} terrestrial habitat, and intertidal flats. The supra tidal flats were typically a series of narrow peninsulas and small islands at an elevation of between 20 to 50 cm above the intertidal flats (Plate 3 - 11 a-b), which themselves support scattered <b>samphires</b> (salt marsh BPPH) mostly of the species Tecticornia halocnemoides and Muellerolimon salicorniaceum. Cyanobacterial mats appeared to be present between the <b>samphires</b> on {{at least some of the}} intertidal flats. No mangroves occurred within this area as the shore height is too great to be wetted by most high tides. As a result, soil salinities are too high and soil moisture content too low to support mangroves (SKM 2007). a. Intertidal flats in foreground and supratidal area in the background. b.

40|$|Gold {{and nickel}} mining {{are a common}} land use in the {{semiarid}} Eastern Goldfields region of Western Australia,, A frequent outcome of mining activity is highly saline landforms that result from {{the widespread use of}} hypersaline (> 50 g L(subscript) - 1 NaCl) groundwater for mineral processing and hydraulic tailings reclamation, and from saline horizons in soils, subsoils and mullock. Under State government legislation, all mined land must be rehabilitated to a stable and sustainable landform at the completion of mining activities. There was little land rehabilitation carried out in the mining industry until the mid 1980 s. At that time, legislation was introduced and, in due course, guidelines were issued on recommended approaches to rehabilitation. Today, rehabilitation of disturbed areas is usually integrated into the mining program and has become the rule rather than the exception. There has, however, been limited innovation in recent years and the established methods are not suitable for every land rehabilitation scenario, especially those where very high salinity is an important factor. The aims of this thesis were to make a contribution towards {{a better understanding of the}} ecology of halophytes suitable for use in revegetation and the likely physical requirements for their sustainable establishment on post-mining landforms. In terms of germination, many of the halophytes currently used for rehabilitation of saline substrates are well suited in that they are able to germinate in solutions of up to 20 g L(subscript) - 1 NaCl. Furthermore, when higher salinities are encountered, seed dormancy is induced until salinity is reduced to a level at which germination can occur. There were differences observed between germination of annual and perennial chenopods that reflected their successional roles where annual chenopods tend to have a higher salt tolerance and germinate more ++rapidly. I developed a tolerance index to enable different germination responses to be readily compared. Values for the tolerance index ranged from 5. 7 to 25. 3 for the halophytic species compared with a value of 0. 2 for the glycophytic Secale cereale. Values for saltbushes (Atriplex) and bluebushes (Maireana) ranged from 6. 5 to 9. 8 while values for <b>samphires</b> (Halosarcia) were higher (10. 7 - 17. 4). Germination and early growth of taxa in the succulent genus, Halosarcia, were also studied. Though a member of the Chenopodiaceae, with a number of species occurring commonly throughout the region, Halosarcia spp. are not widely used in rehabilitation. This is in part attributable to the poor level of knowledge of germination and growth characteristics compared with saltbushes and bluebushes, many of which are widely used. Two species studied, H. halocnemoides subsp. halocnemoides and H. pruinosa, are more salt-tolerant for germination than some other chenopods more widely used. Furthermore, in terms of their early growth, each taxon continued to grow in salinities up to 40 g L(subscript) - 1 NaCl, although root. Production and mass were reduced at that concentration. Another taxon, H. pergranulata subsp. pergranulata, was found to have a partial physical dormancy attributable to the testa, a phenomenon rare among halophytes. Dormancy was alleviated by scarification but was most effective where this occurred near the micropyle. Field trials were conducted to assess methods of rehabilitating severely salt-affected surfaces (EC(subscript) e > 50 dS m(subscript) - 1). In the initial trial, a number of surface treatments, including ripping, rock mulching and mounding, were shown to reduce soil EC, in loam soils over a long period of time (seven years) compared with the control. In a subsequent trial, the use of good quality waste water, in conjunction with ponding banks, strongly ++promoted the establishment of vegetation by supplementing soil moisture and enhancing soil P although a reduction in soil EC(subscript) e was not observed. The depth and duration of ponding influenced the species that established and the cover achieved. Methods by which a soil cover could be established over hypersaline tailings surfaces were also investigated. The absence of a capillary break layer resulted in severe salinisation (EC(subscript) e > 100 dS m(subscript) - 1) of a non-saline clay loam soil cover and likely severe difficulties in establishing and maintaining vegetation on the cover. Two types of capillary break layer, a synthetic membrane and a layer of coarse iron fayalite granules (nickel slag), were both effective at preventing the capillary rise of salts into the soil cover. The physical and biological characteristics of the shores of Lake Lefroy, a large salt lake in the Eastern Goldfields region, were analysed using multivariate techniques. Physical characteristics were strongly influenced by the orientation of the shore relation to the predominant winds, and by depth to the saline groundwater table. Plant species were distributed in zones across the lake shores with small changes in elevation resulting in substantial changes in species distributions. Those plant species occurring at the lowest elevations (Zone I), including Halosarcia spp., exhibited a very high tolerance of saline soil and groundwater through an ability to accumulate Na+ and Cl- and make the necessary osmotic adjustments, and a capacity to tolerance high groundwater levels. Under certain conditions, the lake shore environment could be a useful model for a rehabilitated landform...|$|R
