5|$|Executive {{producer}} R. W. Goodwin recalls {{being on}} {{location for the}} episode's opening scene, in which Detective Barbala is thrown from a window. The room used for the scene had two windows side-by-side, and one had been replaced with sugar glass for the stunt. When the false window was blown out to simulate someone being thrown through it, the crew found that the glass window beside the false one had also accidentally been blown out. The episode's key grip, Al Campbell, suggested that the next shot show Barbala's dog lying beside his body to explain the <b>second</b> <b>window</b> breaking.|$|E
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a <b>second</b> <b>window</b> (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E

25|$|Median power {{frequency}} {{is often used}} {{as a way to}} track fatigue using EMG. Using the median {{power frequency}}, raw EMG data is filtered to reduce noise and then relevant time windows are Fourier Transformed. In the case of fatigue in a 30-second isometric contraction, the first window may be the first second, the <b>second</b> <b>window</b> might be at second 15, and the third window could be the last second of contraction (at second 30). Each window of data is analyzed and the median power frequency is found. Generally, the median power frequency decreases over time, demonstrating fatigue. Some reasons why fatigue is found are due to action potentials of motor units having a similar pattern of repolarization, fast motor units activating and then quickly deactivating while slower motor units remain, and conduction velocities of the nervous system decreasing over time.|$|E

The menu can be resized, and expanded into a full-screen display, which is the default option in Tablet mode. A new virtual desktop system was added. A feature known as Task View displays all open windows and allows users to switch between them, or switch between multiple workspaces. Windows Store apps, which previously could be used only in full screen mode, can now be used in self-contained windows similarly to other programs. Program windows can now be snapped to quadrants of the screen by dragging them to the corner.

500|$|The {{window on}} the north wall of the nave is {{to the east of}} the door, and was added in the 19th century. It has two rounded lights (sections of window {{separated}} by mullions), in similar style to the two-light 17th-century window in the north wall of the north transept. [...] The <b>second</b> <b>window</b> in the transept, in the east wall, is from the 19th century. The two windows in the south transept, in the south and east walls, are both from the 17th century, and are square-headed with two lights. The window in the east wall of the chancel is from the 19th-century and has three lights topped with stonework trefoils. It has an external hoodmould (a decorative stone border) around the top. The glass of all the windows is patterned, and some is coloured; the coloured glass is used {{in the same way as}} in other Anglesey churches whose 19th-century restorations were aided by Henry Stanley, 3rd Baron Stanley of Alderley, an Anglesey nobleman who converted to Islam.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of Law & Order: Criminal Intent premiered during the 2001–2002 {{television}} {{season on the}} American terrestrial television network NBC. The pilot episode, titled [...] "", aired on Sunday September 30, 2001 at 9:00p.m. EST. Episodes aired weekly until December, when the show took a brief hiatus until January, and took another hiatus during February. The final episode of the season aired at 9:00p.m. on Friday May 10, 2002. Under a $100,000-per-episode shared or <b>second</b> <b>window</b> syndication agreement that cable channel USA Network made with NBC, USA Network was allowed to broadcast episodes out of primetime a week after their premiere on NBC. The season is also under a regular off-network syndication deal at USA Networks and Bravo. The two channels teamed up late 2004 to pay $2 million per episode for the syndication rights to the series, allowing USA Network to air episodes during the week, and Bravo to air episodes at the weekend. In 2007, Fox Television Stations, a group of Fox Broadcasting Company owned-and-operated stations, entered a syndication deal to broadcast episodes {{as part of its}} daytime schedule. From late 2009, MyNetworkTV will broadcast Law & Order: Criminal Intent, including episodes from season one, having changed their business model from a network broadcaster to a syndication programming service. The series has also been distributed to international broadcasters. It aired in Canada on CTV, in France on TF1, in the United Kingdom on Hallmark Channel and Five, in Australia on Network Ten, and in New Zealand on TV3.|$|E

[...] Its style suggests it {{is the work of}} Clayton and Bell. [...] The three-light south transept window (St Oswald, St George and St Edmund) is by Kempe and Co, 1916. [...] The south aisle's first window by Charles Eamer Kempe, 1898, shows the Annunciation. [...] The <b>second</b> <b>window,</b> designed by Mary Lowndes and produced by James Powell and Sons in 1891, is on the theme [...] "Suffer the little children to come unto me" [...] (Mark 10:14).

[...] Another Jones & Willis window, dating from 1895 and depicting Faith, is in the crossing, and they also designed a <b>second</b> <b>window</b> in the north wall of the chancel in about 1908. [...] The west window of the nave has Kempe glass from 1905 depicting the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, and his firm Kempe & Co. installed stained glass in the north aisle in 1910 and 1925 and in the nave in 1919 and 1926.

[...] The north transept's north window was made in 1928 by Kempe and Co after Kempe's death; its east window (Madonna and Child, and St Nicholas with children) by Frederick Charles Eden, a Brighton man, in 1935. [...] In the Parham chapel, the north window is full of local interest, its five lights depicting Lancelot Andrewes, St Richard of Chichester, St Peter (the dedicatee of the church), St Wilfrid (whom Gibbon called the Apostle of Sussex), and St Augustine of Canterbury. [...] It was produced by Kempe and Co in 1920. [...] The chapel's east window, in four lights, is a 1921 work by Geoffrey Fuller Webb. [...] It shows the Captain of the Host of the Lord appearing to Joshua before Jericho (Joshua 5:13–15), and St John the Divine writing about the Holy City.|$|E
2500|$|The home's conveniences {{were rare}} {{at the time}} of its construction. These {{included}} steam and forced-air heating, modern indoor toilets and plumbing, push-button gas lights, and Mrs. Winchester's personal (and only) hot shower from indoor plumbing. There are also three elevators, including an Otis electric and one of which was powered by a rare horizontal hydraulic elevator piston. (Most elevator pistons are vertical to save space, but Winchester preferred the improved functionality of the horizontal configuration.) Mrs. Winchester never skimped on the many adornments that she believed contributed to its architectural beauty. Many of the stained glass windows were created by the Tiffany Company. Some were designed specifically for her, and others by her, including a [...] "spider web" [...] window that featured her favorite web design and the repetition of the number thirteen, another of her preoccupations. This window was never installed, but exists in the so-called [...] "$25,000 storage room" [...] - so named because its contents were originally appraised at a value of $25,000.
