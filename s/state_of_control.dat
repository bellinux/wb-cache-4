3000|$|An {{extreme case}} <b>of</b> {{intermittent}} <b>control</b> is impulsive control {{which has been}} gained increasing interest and intensively researched [33, 34]. The prominent characteristic <b>of</b> impulsive <b>control</b> is that the <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> system will [...] "jump" [...] at certain discrete time moments, namely, the control is with zero duration of time. Because the <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> systems are changed directly, impulsive control is an effective approach when the states are observable, {{but it seems to}} be invalid when the <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> systems are unobservable.|$|R

50|$|Thus {{the process}} is {{continually}} evolving and correcting for anomalies {{that occur in the}} process. Eventually the process can evolve into periodic monitoring once sufficient data demonstrates that {{the process is}} in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Any anomaly that occurs once a process is in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> may result in the process being invalidated and not in control and could potentially result in product withdraw from the market to ensure patient safety. A formal product withdraw is only done when the quality, safety or efficacy of a product is questionable. A single anomaly would not necessarily require a product withdraw if there is sufficient stability data that demonstrates that excursions will not affect product quality.|$|E

5000|$|In 1989, as a {{follow-up}} to their Enigma debut, they released <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control,</b> and Hotter than Hell Live!, a full production live album on Medusa Records, was released the following year (1990). A few months later, Rock for the King was reissued and has since become a collector's item. Subsequent to lead singer Michael Lee (now known as Michael Drive) pursuing another project (becoming writer and lead vocalist for the band Bare Bones), vocalist Vincent Van Voltenburg, aka, Vin Van Volt, of the Christian Metal quartet, Full Armor, was introduced as the new lead singer and took the reins for all live performances during the 1990 [...] "State of Control World Tour" [...] which included sold out shows in Ireland, Germany, Austria and the U.S. Soon after the 1990 World Tour ended, the new lineup with Ray Parris on (Guitar), Jim LaVerde (Bass), Vin Van Volt (vocals) and David LaVai (drums), was to begin writing for the next record which might have included a Vin Van Volt song called [...] "Pain Reliever". The song, a new sound for Barren Cross, was well received by audiences on the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> tour. The record with this new lineup would never materialize, and Barren Cross went on hiatus until their last full-length release (to date), the stylistically evolved Rattle Your Cage, released on Rugged Records in 1994. [...] "Rattle Your Cage" [...] featured all of the original members of Barren Cross.|$|E
50|$|Continued process {{verification}} (CPV) is {{the collection}} and analysis of end-to-end production components and processes data to ensure product outputs are within predetermined quality limits. In 2011 the Food and Drug Administration published a report outlining best practices regarding business process validation in the pharmaceutical industry. Continued process verification is outlined in this report as the third stage in process validation. Its central purpose {{is to ensure that}} processes are in a constant <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> thus ensuring final product quality. Central to effective CPV is a method with which to identify unwanted process inconsistencies in order to execute corrective or preventative measures. Once quality standards are set in place they must be monitored with regular frequency to confirm those parameters are being met. Continued process verification not only helps protect consumers from production faults, but business also see benefits in implementing a CPV program. Should product outputs not match target standards it can be very costly to investigate the problem source without existing CPV data.|$|E
50|$|Critical process {{parameters}} (CPP) in {{pharmaceutical manufacturing}} are key variables affecting the production process. CPPs are attributes that are monitored to detect deviations in standardized production operations and product output quality or changes in Critical Quality Attributes. Those attributes {{with a higher}} impact on CQAs should be prioritized and held in a stricter <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> The manufacturer should conduct test to set acceptable range limits of the determined CPPs and define acceptable process variable variability. Operational conditions within this range are considered acceptable operational standards. Any deviation from the acceptable range will be indicative of issues within {{the process and the}} subsequent production of substandard products. Data relating to CPP should be recorded, stored, and analyzed by the manufacturer. CPP variables and ranges should be reevaluated after careful analysis of historical CPP data. Identifying CPPs is done in stage one of Process Validation: Process design and ???are an essential part of a manufacturing control strategy.|$|E

5000|$|Britain: It {{was thought}} that the lynx had died out in Britain either about 10,000 years ago, after the ice had retreated, or about 4,000 years ago, during a cooler and wetter climate change. However, carbon dating of lynx bones from caves in Sutherland in the Scottish Highlands and in Craven in North Yorkshire show they still lived in Britain between 80 and 425 AD, with {{cultural}} sources suggesting a survival until the medieval period. Old names for the species in the languages of Britain include Lugh (Gaelic), Llew (Welsh) and Lox (Old English). There is interest in reintroducing the lynx to Britain in order to return some natural <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> to deer populations, which have no natural predators left in Britain. A study of the biological feasibility of reintroducing Eurasian lynx to Scotland indicates there is sufficiently abundant prey and well-connected habitat to support a viable population of over 400 animals. Interest in reintroducing the species was further bolstered in 2016 {{in relation to a}} successful breeding programme for the Iberian lynx in Spain. Plans have also been submitted by the Lynx UK Trust to Natural England to introduce the lynx to Kielder Forest.|$|E
5000|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} to Kingsley that the council could not {{make a decision on}} the rights of free blacks and mixed-race people, he resigned his position. Through the 1820s the council began to enact strict laws separating the races, and Kingsley became worried about his future and the rights of his family. To address these issues, in 1828 he wrote a pamphlet titled A Treatise on the Patriarchal or Co-operative System of Society as it Exists in Some Governments, and Colonies in America, and the United States Under the Name of Slavery With its Necessary Advantages crediting himself as [...] "An Inhabitant of Florida", defending the system to which he had become accustomed. In it, he wrote, [...] "Slavery is a necessary <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> from which no condition of society can be perfectly free. The term is applicable to and fits all grades and conditions in almost every point of view, whether moral, physical, or political."Kingsley asserted that when slavery is associated with cruelty it is an abomination; when it is joined with benevolence and justice, it [...] "easily amalgamates with the ordinary conditions of life".|$|E
50|$|Georgia is the {{regional}} center for biological-and virological research and also hosts {{a number of}} soviet military- and research facilities as well as storage areas that contain radioactive and chemical substances. Those facilities are subjected to a permanent <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and monitoring by the SSSG. However, on the occupied territories international security measures have not been implemented thus maintaining transit routes and much greater vulnerability to smuggling of CBRN material through the country than already present. Such weaknesses have been exploited on multiple occasions throughout the years. Many {{attempts were made to}} smuggle depleted and enriched uranium in or out of the country, however most of those have been prevented by investigative and operative events. In the more recent period alone over 19 individuals have been detained on charges of illicit trafficking of nuclear material in four incidents. Georgia works closely with the US, UN, partner nations and the CBRN CoE and was the first nation to elaborate and adopt the Strategy and Action Plan of the EU thus becoming one of the primary members of the 28 nations initiative. One of the SSSGs prioirities is to also become member of the G7 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction.|$|E
