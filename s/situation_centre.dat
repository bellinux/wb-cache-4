The 2012 Elections <b>Situation</b> <b>Centre</b> was run on private donations and was situated at Kutafin Moscow State Law University (MSAL). Young lawyers from all 83 regions performed the functions of election observers at 86, 000 polling stations. More than 500 young lawyers worked at the <b>Situation</b> <b>Centre,</b> where they processed the incoming information and operated the hot line 24/7. Both Russian and international observers appraised the organizational management and pointed out the high-scale engagement of the youth in the nation's activity. Two months prior to, and on the very day of the elections 4 500 inquiries were received at the centre, and the observers conducted immediate meticulous examination of each of them.

40|$|In Germany, an {{extensive}} siren system {{was used in}} the past to warn the population against disasters: in case of natural hazards, industrial accidents or other disaster scenarios, <b>situation</b> <b>centres</b> could trigger the loud siren alarm. Detailed information about the danger situation was provided by radio and television. However, {{after the end of the}} Cold War, most sirens were dismantled in the mid-nineties. Today there exists a satellite-based warning system SatWaS, which distributes warning messages via radio and television. But if TV and radio are off, the warning goes unheard. A reinstallation of the former siren system would cost several hundred million Euros plus additional millions per year for maintenance. This is why German federal and state governments since years are searching for alternative solutions. Cell-broadcast systems can send mass SMS messages to mobile phones. Smoke detectors, radio-controlled clocks and weather stations with radio receiver can also trigger alarm. Despite the high distribution rate of some of these devices, it cannot be ensured that a warning reaches the entire population. Only individual persons or households can be warned, and only if the devices are on standby 24 / 7 / 365. The Fraunhofer INT develops a new warning system based on the use of car horns. In case of disaster the <b>situation</b> <b>centres</b> can define a region inside which every parked car will start to honk its horn corresponding to a predefined warning signal. To activate the cars they have to be equipped with a radio receiver, based on e. g. RDS, eWarn, GSM or different technology. The system will exploit the data of a GPS receiver coming with the introduction of the Telematics platform eCall. Besides sirens this system is the only one based on broadcast signals. It is independent from power lines and allows the free definition of alarm zones...|$|R

40|$|Newborn {{screening}} (NBS) for {{cystic fibrosis}} (CF) {{has been carried}} out in Victoria, Australia since 1989. The primary screen is immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) followed by DeltaF 508 mutation analysis. As part of this process, carrier babies are detected and their parents are routinely offered carrier testing as part of their follow up. The DeltaF 508 parent is identified and the other parent has an extended mutation analysis performed in case they are also a carrier. One of the mutations in the extended analysis is R 117 H which is associated with a broad phenotypic range, from CF with suppurative lung disease, to no clinical disease. We present four healthy DeltaF 508 carrier babies identified by our NBS service with both parents identified as carriers, one DeltaF 508 and the other R 117 H. Owing to the variable phenotype associated with R 117 H we have developed an approach to this difficult genetic counselling <b>situation.</b> <b>Centres</b> offering or considering NBS for CF will need an approach to this problem...|$|R
