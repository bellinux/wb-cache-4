40|$|International audienceThe {{evolution}} of a buoyant vortex (thermal) in stationary and irrotational plane stagnation flows (with vertical velocity opposing thermal's upward movement) is studied using both direct numerical simulation (DNS) and theoretical tools. The influence of external flow on the spatio-temporal development of the buoyant fluid is explored through the ratio τ between the two relevant time scales associated with the ambient flow and buoyancy (viscous and diffusive effects, although included, are taken to be relatively small). The {{evolution of}} the flows considered is governed by τ and initial height of the thermal. Once released from rest, thermal's evolution is composed of two stages: an initial phase in which circulation is being generated, followed by a phase where the circulation is approximately constant, and both separated by a transitional regime which {{is related to the}} formation of a 'hole' in the buoyant structure. Time evolution of vorticity and density fields, center of mass of the thermal and its circulation are tracked using DNS for different regimes. Application of Kelvin-Bjerknes' theorem shows that during the initial <b>stage,</b> <b>circulation</b> grows linearly with time before reaching a constant value. When τ is increased, the ambient fluid penetrates earlier into the buoyant mass, causing quicker formation of the buoyant vortex ring, reducing the attainable maximum circulation. To predict the integral quantities of the thermal, a simple inviscid Lagrangian model is proposed in which the initial disturbance is composed of a stack of thin vortex elements. The model predicts well the circulation and kinematic characteristics of the thermal during the less studied initial stage of the thermal's evolution. The evolution of the thermal is found to be governed by a feedback mechanism. Accordingly, it is shown that the generation of circulation is proportional to the temporal height of the disturbance which depends on the induced velocity (and the imposed base-flow velocity); this in-turn depends on the circulation and the shape of the disturbance. Finally, theoretical analysis (in agreement with DNS) shows that the fluid impulse of the thermal grows linearly in a stationary fluid, and is found to grow/decay exponentially in plane stagnation flow, the temporal evolution of which is only a function of the ratio τ (and its initial value) ...|$|E

At the blood <b>circulation</b> <b>stage,</b> the number and the volume of HGCs increased significantly, and HGCs spread more widely {{with the development of}} the embryo; When the embryo reached the eye pigmentation stage，zymogen granules at different stages were detected,and every one of the zymogen granule was wrapped by membrane, so that the limit between others can be distinguished significantly; When the embryo reached the pre-hatching stage, the hatching enzyme granules were secreted into the perivitelline space from the top of HGCs. The secreted granules were spherical and 0. 25 – 1. 00 μm in diameter. Some of the secreted granules were monomer and the others got together. The hatching enzyme was dissolved in the perivitelline fluid,where it gained access to the egg envelope and digested the inner layer of egg envelope；At the larval fish just after hatching stage, the secretion of HGCs have finished and HGCs gradually disappeared from epidermis.

Six hours later it weakened to a tropical storm, and 12 h {{after the hurricane}} <b>stage</b> a <b>circulation</b> center {{could not be found}} at 850 hPa by aircraft reconnaissance. At hurricane strength the vortex contained classic structure seen in intensifying hurricanes, with the exception of 7 - 12 C dewpoint depressions in the lower troposphere upshear of the center. These extended from the 100 -km radius to immediately adjacent to the eyewall, where equivalent potential temperature gradients reached 6 K/km. The dry air was not present prior to intensification, suggesting that it was associated with vertical shear-induced subsidence upshear of the developing storm. It is argued that weakening of the vortex was driven by cooling associated with the mixing of dry air into the core, and subsequent evaporation and cold downdrafts. Evidence suggests that this mixing might have been enhanced by eyewall instabilities after the period of rapid deepening. The existence of a fragile, small, but genuinely hurricane-strength vortex at the surface for 6 h presents difficult problems for forecasters.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{design of}} the steady-state and dynamic performance of a process {{has the ability to}} satisfy much more demanding dynamic performance criteria than the design of dynamics only by the connection of a control system. A method for designing process dynamics based on the use of a linearised systems 2 ̆ 7 eigenvalues has been developed. The eigenvalues are associated with system states using the unit perturbation spectral resolution (UPSR), characterising the dynamics of each state. The design method uses a homotopy approach to determine a final design which satisfies both steady-state and dynamic performance criteria. A highly interacting single <b>stage</b> forced <b>circulation</b> evaporator system, including control loops, was designed by this method with the goal of reducing the time taken for the liquid composition to reach steady-state. Initially the system was successfully redesigned to speed up the eigenvalue associated with the liquid composition state, but this did not result in an improved startup performance. Further analysis showed that the integral action of the composition controller was the source of the limiting eigenvalue. Design changes made to speed up this eigenvalue did result in an improved startup performance. The proposed approach provides a structured way to address the design-control interface, giving significant insight into the dynamic behaviour of the system such that a systematic design or redesign of an existing system can be undertaken with confidence...|$|R

Phyllosilicates are found in a network of veins cross-cutting the carbonate and calc-silicate matrix, indicating their formation during a process of hydrothermal alteration superimposed on the contact aureole.
