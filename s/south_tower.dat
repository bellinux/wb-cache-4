5|$|Three {{months after}} San Francisco {{approved}} the project, construction {{began on the}} <b>South</b> <b>Tower</b> with a groundbreaking ceremony on November 10, 2005. The <b>South</b> <b>Tower</b> was the second-tallest tower under construction in San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the north}} tower and the <b>south</b> <b>tower</b> of the Rincon Hill complex bear a {{resemblance}} to The Heritage at Millennium Park in Chicago, a building of a similar height to the <b>south</b> <b>tower</b> also designed by Solomon, Cordwell, Buenz and Associates. The architectural style for both buildings of the Rincon Hill complex is late-modernist. The three sides of the <b>South</b> <b>Tower</b> facing southeast, northeast, and northwest have a linear glass curtainwall. The North Tower has a similar design, except it is shorter and the curved aluminum and glass side faces northeast. Both skyscrapers of the Rincon Hill project contain an oval-shaped crown housing mechanical equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} site, located {{right next}} to the western approach of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, formerly contained a clock tower. The clock tower was demolished shortly after the city approved the One Rincon Hill project. Construction of the townhomes and the <b>South</b> <b>Tower</b> lasted from 2005 to 2008, but was stopped for brief periods of time due to seismic concerns and a construction accident. As the <b>South</b> <b>Tower</b> neared completion, it generated controversy concerning view encroachment, high pricing, and architectural style.|$|E

5|$|The <b>South</b> <b>Tower</b> has one freight {{and three}} {{passenger}} elevators. The elevators are the second fastest {{in the city}} of San Francisco, second only to those in 555 California Street and tied with those in 555 Mission Street. The elevators of the <b>South</b> <b>Tower</b> can travel from the ground floor to the 61st floor (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow. This means the elevators can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in a minute. The elevators have artificial intelligence control systems that figure out passenger traffic patterns and dispatch the three elevators to handle passenger needs accordingly. The bottom of each elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside.|$|E

5|$|At 8:46a.m. (EDT) on September 11, 2001, five hijackers {{affiliated}} with al-Qaeda crashed American Airlines Flight 11 into the northern {{facade of the}} North Tower. Seventeen minutes later, at 9:03a.m. (EDT), a second group of terrorists crashed the hijacked United Airlines Flight 175 into the southern facade of the <b>South</b> <b>Tower,</b> striking between the 77th and 85th floors.|$|E
5|$|The {{roof of the}} <b>south</b> <b>tower</b> {{provides}} {{views of}} the surrounding landscape; in the 13th-century protective wooden mantlets would have been fitted into the gaps of the merlons along the battlements, and during the English Civil War it was equipped with additional wooden defences to protect the garrison.|$|E
5|$|United Airlines Flight 175: a Boeing 767 aircraft, {{departed}} Logan Airport at 8:14a.m. {{en route}} to Los Angeles with a crew of nine and 51 passengers, not including five hijackers. The hijackers flew the plane into the southern facade of the <b>South</b> <b>Tower</b> of the World Trade Center in New York City at 9:03a.m.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} 110-floor Twin Towers, {{numerous}} other buildings at the World Trade Center site were destroyed or badly damaged, including WTC buildings 3 through 7 and St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church. The North Tower, <b>South</b> <b>Tower,</b> the Marriott Hotel (3WTC), and 7WTC were completely destroyed. The U.S. Customs House (6 World Trade Center), 4 World Trade Center, 5 World Trade Center, and both pedestrian bridges connecting buildings were severely damaged. The Deutsche Bank Building on 130 Liberty Street was partially damaged and demolished some years later, starting in 2007. The two {{buildings of the}} World Financial Center also suffered damage.|$|E
5|$|Later, in an on-air {{phone call}} from {{his office at the}} CNN New York bureau, CNN {{vice-president}} of finance Sean Murtagh reported that a large passenger commercial jet had hit the World Trade Center. Eventually, other television networks interrupted regular broadcasting with news of the crash. President George W. Bush was arriving at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida. Initial news reports speculated that the crash had been an accident until United Airlines Flight 175 was flown into the <b>South</b> <b>Tower</b> 17 minutes after Flight 11 made impact.|$|E
5|$|The <b>South</b> <b>Tower</b> was {{completed}} in September 2008, with all residential floors ready for residents. As of, April 2009, 70% of the South Tower's 376 luxury units and 14 townhouses had been sold. Because of the occupancy rate and low profits so far, the developers had initially refused to pay $5.4 million in development fees that would be spent on rent subsidies, job training programs and community development in the South of Market area. However, the developers finally agreed to pay the city.|$|E
50|$|Dinner {{theater and}} knights' tournaments (with medieval games) are regular {{features}} at the castle. Since spring 2007 {{the north and}} <b>south</b> <b>towers</b> are accessible to the public after extensive restoration.|$|R
50|$|The Towers Complex {{is made up}} {{into four}} {{residence}} halls: North & <b>South</b> <b>Towers,</b> and Singular and Trusler Towers. Trusler went under renovation in the fall 2013, with Singular going under renovation in the spring 2014.|$|R
5000|$|The Bocom Financial Towers (...) are two {{conjoined}} skyscrapers which reach 265 metres (869 feet) in height. They {{are located}} in the Pudong District of Shanghai, China and are split into the North and <b>South</b> <b>Towers.</b> Both towers were designed by ABB Architekten. The North tower is the 64th tallest existing building in the world when measured up to the highest architectural point.|$|R
5|$|The castle {{remained}} in military ownership, {{but it became}} more of a museum from the 1920s onwards. During the Second World War, the castle was still in service {{as part of the}} Magazine Establishment and was damaged by two enemy bombs which fell in 1941. The bombing dislodged pieces of plaster in the castle's <b>south</b> <b>tower</b> and gatehouse, under which were discovered old graffiti, including a drawing of a ship dated to around 1700.|$|E
5|$|Three {{buildings}} in the World Trade Center collapsed due to fire-induced structural failure. The <b>South</b> <b>Tower</b> collapsed at 9:59a.m. after burning for 56minutes in a fire caused by the impact of United Airlines Flight 175 and the explosion of its fuel. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28a.m. after burning for 102minutes. When the North Tower collapsed, debris fell on the nearby 7 World Trade Center building (7WTC), damaging it and starting fires. These fires burned for hours, compromising the building's structural integrity, and 7WTC collapsed at 5:21p.m. The {{west side of the}} Pentagon sustained significant damage.|$|E
5|$|A pair of towers {{stand on}} the river's edge a short {{distance}} on either side from the main building. They were originally two-storyed open-backed structures with gun platforms situated on their first floors, providing flanking fire down {{the line of the}} ditch around the castle's perimeter. They were later adapted for use as accommodation, with their backs closed with bricks and the towers increased in height to provide a third storey. Traces of the gun embrasures can still be seen {{at the point where the}} original roofline was. The <b>South</b> <b>Tower</b> was said to have been for the use of the castle's governor, though their lack of comfort meant that successive governors declined to live there. The two towers are linked to the main building by a crenallated curtain wall where additional cannon were emplaced in two embrasures on the north parapet and one on the south.|$|E
50|$|At ESU, all {{incoming}} freshmen {{students must}} {{live in the}} Towers Complex (North & <b>South</b> <b>Towers,</b> Singular & Trusler), unless they live within a 30 mi radius of the campus. Upperclassmen have the choice to live in Morse Hall Complex.|$|R
50|$|The first {{tower blocks}} to be {{constructed}} by Birmingham City Council were the four collectively {{known as the}} Duddeston Four, the 12-storey High, Queens, Home and <b>South</b> <b>Towers,</b> completed between 1954 and 1955 to a design by S. N. Cooke and Partners.|$|R
50|$|<b>South</b> Bay <b>Tower,</b> {{also known}} as the Gateway Center, is a {{proposed}} skyscraper planned for Boston, Massachusetts. If completed, <b>South</b> Bay <b>Tower</b> would stand as the tallest building in Boston, Massachusetts, and New England, surpassing the 60-story John Hancock Tower by 7 stories and at least 10 ft. The <b>South</b> Bay <b>tower</b> would be built on 10 acre of land off Hudson Street just south of Downtown Boston, in an area of Chinatown reclaimed following the conclusion of the Big Dig.|$|R
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the restoration work, the structural and architectural engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates completed {{an evaluation of the}} building's eastern and southern facades, focusing on its terra cotta portions. By using ultrasonic testing, engineers were able to evaluate the state of the terra cotta without further damaging the pieces. Severely cracked or damaged pieces were partially removed and a report was written from these findings. This report provided recommendations for the masonry facade and terra cotta repair work. Restoration work began in spring 2009 and is scheduled for completion in early 2010. All of the damaged terra cotta elements have been replaced on the <b>south</b> <b>tower</b> and parapet, and scaffolding has been erected on building's eastern facade in {{preparation for}} further restoration work. Fully restoring the building's exterior terra cotta pieces and clay roof tiles {{is the first step in}} a long-range $2million repair plan.|$|E
5|$|Suqami's {{passport}} {{survived the}} crash {{and landed in}} the street below. Soaked in jet fuel, it {{was picked up by}} a passerby who gave it to a New York City Police Department (NYPD) detective shortly before the <b>South</b> <b>Tower</b> collapsed. Investigators retrieved Mohamed Atta's luggage, which had not been loaded onto the flight. In it they found Omari's passport and driver's license, a videocassette for a Boeing757 flight simulator, a folding knife, and pepper spray. In a recording, a few months later in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, took responsibility for the attack. The attack on the World Trade Center exceeded even bin Laden's expectations: he had expected only the floors above the plane strikes to collapse. The flight recorders for Flight11 and Flight175 were never found.|$|E
5|$|The FAA {{was aware}} {{at this point}} that there was an {{emergency}} on board the airplane. By this time, Flight 11 had already crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center and Flight 175 was known to have been hijacked and was within minutes of striking the <b>South</b> <b>Tower.</b> After learning of this second hijacking involving an American Airlines aircraft and the hijacking involving United Airlines, American Airlines' executive vice president Gerard Arpey ordered a nationwide ground stop for the airline. The Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center, as well as American Airlines dispatchers, made several failed attempts to contact the aircraft. At the time the airplane was hijacked, it was flying over an area of limited radar coverage. With air controllers unable to contact the flight by radio, an Indianapolis official declared that the Boeing 757 had possibly crashed at 09:09.|$|E
50|$|The school forms {{a square}} with a {{courtyard}} in the middle. The {{sides of the}} school are 3 stories high. Between {{the west and the}} north towers there are the classrooms. Between the north and east towers is the San and the headmistresses rooms. Between the east and <b>south</b> <b>towers</b> are the entrance, gym, assembly hall, labs and art room. Between the <b>south</b> and west <b>tower</b> are the mistresses rooms.|$|R
50|$|While many of Dickinson's works still stand, an {{increasing}} number have been lost. Most recently, the Regent Park <b>South</b> <b>Towers</b> and the Jesuit Seminary have been demolished. Out of the five houses that Dickinson designed, only one - the Isadore Sharp Residence - remains.|$|R
2500|$|Because of its site, jutting {{into the}} Forth, and its long, narrow shape, the castle has been characterised as [...] "the ship that never sailed".
