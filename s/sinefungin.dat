50|$|<b>Sinefungin</b> {{is another}} SAM-competitive {{inhibitor}} similar to DZNep, however, like DZNep, {{it is not}} specific to EZH2. It works by binding in the cofactor binding pocket of DNA methyltransferases to block methyl transfer. EI1 is another inhibitor, developed by Novartis, that showed EZH2 inhibitory activity in lymphoma tumor cells, including cells with the Y641 mutation. The mechanism of this inhibitor also involves competing with the SAM cofactor for binding to EZH2. GSK126 is a potent, SAM-competitive EZH2 inhibitor developed by GlaxoSmithKline, that has 150-fold selectivity over EZH1 and a Ki of 0.5-3 nM. UNC1999 was developed as an analogue of GSK126, {{and was the first}} orally bioavailable EZH2 inhibitor to show activity. However, it is less selective than its counterpart GSK126, and it binds to EZH1 as well, increasing the potential for off-target effects.|$|E

This compound has been reported to display antiparasitic activity against malarial, trypanosomal, and leishmanial species. Very {{little is known about the}} antiparasitic mode of action of <b>sinefungin.</b> We found that S-adenosylmethionine was capable of reversing the inhibitory growth effects of <b>sinefungin</b> in Leishmania mexicana and that dATP was capable of reversing inhibitory effects of the drug on DNA polymerase activity when pyrophosphate release was measured. However, when incorporation of [3 H]dTTP was used to measure DNA polymerase activity, no inhibition could be observed. Inhibition of DNA polymerase activity by <b>sinefungin</b> occurred only during the initial stages of purification of this enzyme, and inhibition by aphidicolin, a known DNA polymerase inhibitor, paralleled the inhibition by <b>sinefungin.</b> Neither <b>sinefungin</b> nor aphidicolin inhibited partially purified DNA polymerase. S-Adenosylmethionine synthetase was partially purified, and <b>sinefungin,</b> at levels active in vitro, had no significant effect. <b>Sinefungin</b> was significantly suppressive against both L. donovani and L. braziliensis panamensis infections in hamsters when compared with meglumine antimonate (Glucantime) ...|$|E
40|$|The S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) analog <b>sinefungin</b> is {{a natural}} product {{antibiotic}} that inhibits nucleic acid methyltransferases and arrests the growth of unicellular eukarya and eukaryal viruses. The basis for the particular sensitivity of fungi and protozoa to <b>sinefungin</b> is not known. Here we report the isolation and characterization of spontaneous sinefungin-resistant mutants of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In all cases, <b>sinefungin</b> resistance was attributable to a loss-of-function mutation in Sam 3, the yeast high-affinity AdoMet transporter. Overexpression of wild-type Sam 3 increased the sensitivity of yeast to growth inhibition by <b>sinefungin.</b> Thus, Sam 3 is a tunable determinant of <b>sinefungin</b> potency. The shared ability of protozoan parasites to import AdoMet might determine sinefungin's anti-infective spectrum. Insights to the intracellular action of <b>sinefungin</b> stem from the finding that increased gene dosage of yeast AdoMet synthase plus cap guanine-N 7 methyltransferase afforded greater resistance to <b>sinefungin</b> than either enzyme alone.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of [35 S]methionine in cultured bloodstream {{forms of}} African trypanosomes was followed using flow-through radiodetection linked to liquid chromatography separation. The {{effects of a}} transmethylase inhibitor, <b>sinefungin,</b> and of the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine (Ornidyl; DFMO), on methionine metabolism were also observed. Trypanosomes rapidly incorporated [35 S]methionine into S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and the metabolites methylthioadenosine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, homocysteine, cystathionine cysteine and glutathione. Untreated trypanosomes excreted large quantities of cystathionine and cysteine into the growth medium. DFMO-treated cells formed larger quantities of AdoMet more rapidly than did control cells, as was evident from initial time points (30 min and 1 h). Decarboxylated AdoMet, present in trace quantities in control cells, accumulated in DFMO-treated cells. <b>Sinefungin</b> increased the AdoMet concentrations approximately 20 -fold over that of controls after a 6 h incubation with [35 S]methionine, while cystathionine and cysteine levels decreased.

40|$|Thiazolylpeptide GE 2270 is {{a potent}} {{antibiotic}} inhibiting protein synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. It is produced as a complex of 10 related metabolites, differing mainly {{in the degree of}} methylation, by fermentation of the rare actinomycete Planobispora rosea ATCC 53773. Addition of vitamin B 12 to the fermentation medium doubled total complex production and markedly changed the relative production of the various GE 2270 metabolites, enhancing the biosynthesis of the more methylated component A. Among methylation inhibitors, the addition of <b>sinefungin</b> increased the amount of factor D 2, which differs from component A in the lack of a methyl group. Since <b>sinefungin</b> is an S-adenosyl-L-methionine methyltransferase-specific inhibitor, these results indicate that the methylation step converting D 2 into A involves an S-adenosyl-L-methionine methyltransferase. Simultaneous supplementation of vitamin B 12 and <b>sinefungin</b> led to a twofold increase in D 2 concentration, showing that vitamin B 12, in addition to having an effect on the late methylation step, exerts a stimulating action on antibiotic backbone synthesis. This is possibly due to its role in an unusual pathway of serine synthesis peculiar to P. rosea metabolism.

Electrophoretic gel retardation assays with purified M·RsrI were performed on unmethylated, hemimethylated, dimethylated or non-specific target DNA duplexes (25 bp) in the presence of <b>sinefungin,</b> a potent inhibitory analog of AdoMet. M·RsrI binding was affected by the methylation status of the DNA substrate and was enhanced by the presence of the cofactor analog. M·RsrI bound DNA substrates in the presence of <b>sinefungin</b> with decreasing affinities: hemimethylated > unmethylated > dimethylated >> non-specific DNA. Gel retardation studies with DNA substrates containing an abasic site substituted for the target adenine DNA provided evidence consistent with M·RsrI extruding the target base from the duplex. Consistent with such base flipping, an ∼ 1. 7 -fold fluorescence intensity increase was observed upon stoichiometric addition of M·RsrI to hemimethylated DNA containing the fluorescent analog 2 -aminopurine in place of the target adenine. Pre-steady-state kinetic and isotope- partitioning experiments revealed that the enzyme displays burst kinetics, confirmed the catalytic competence of the M·RsrI–AdoMet complex and eliminated the possibility of an ordered mechanism where DNA is required to bind first.

40|$|Protein {{arginine}} methyltransferases (PRMTs) are a {{group of}} eukaryotic enzymes that catalyze the methylation of Arg residues {{in a variety of}} proteins (e. g., histones H 3 and H 4), and their activities influence a wide range of cellular processes, including cell growth, RNA splicing, differentiation, and transcriptional regulation. Dysregulation of these enzymes has been linked to heart disease and cancer, suggesting this enzyme family as a novel therapeutic target. To aid the development of PRMT inhibitors, we characterized the substrate specificity of both the rat and human PRMT 1 orthologues using histone based peptide substrates. N- and C-terminal truncations to identify a minimal peptide substrate indicate that long-range interactions between enzyme and substrate are important for high rates of substrate capture.

Protein methylase I 1 transferred methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (S-AdoMet) to the carboxyl residues of several protein substrates, exhibiting highest activity with histone VIII-S (arginine-rich subgroup f 3). The crude enzyme had an apparent K,,, for histone VIII-S of 28 mg ml-l (11. 4 mM-aspartyl and 18. 4 mM-glutamyl residues methylated), and an apparent Km for S-AdoMet of 8. 4 PM.

Dioctylamine was the most potent inhibitor with a competitive inhibition constant of 130 nM with respect to the phospholipids. Compound 2 bound to the two substrate-binding sites of the enzyme suggesting that it acted as a bisubstrate analog (apparent inhibition constant, K(I) = 6 microM). Compound 2 was also found to completely inhibit cyclopropanation of the phospholipids in growing E. coli cells, at 150 microM.

The highly conserved eukaryotic nucleolar protein Nep 1 has an essential but unknown function in 18 S rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the malfunction of a temperature-sensitive Nep 1 protein (nep 1 - 1 ts) was suppressed by the addition of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). This suggests the participation of Nep 1 in a methyltransferase reaction during ribosome biogenesis. In addition, yeast Nep 1 binds to a 6 -nt RNA-binding motif also found in 18 S rRNA and facilitates the incorporation of ribosomal protein Rps 19 during the formation of pre-ribosomes.

The TehB-SAM crystals belonged to space group C 2, with unit-cell parameters a = 60. 0, b = 56. 1, c = 130. 6 Å, β = 97. 9 °. The TehB-sinefungin crystals belonged to space group P 21, with unit-cell parameters a = 59. 1, b = 55. 5, c = 129. 7 Å, β = 95. 9 °...|$|E
40|$|The {{involvement}} of a carrier for <b>sinefungin</b> (SF) uptake in Leishmania donovani promastigotes {{is indicated by}} saturation kinetics, competition studies and SF accumulation against a 270 -fold concentration gradient across the cell membrane. Whether SF uptake occurs via nucleoside- or AdoMet-carrier systems was investigated by competition experiments and comparison of the uptake of various molecules in wild-type and SF-resistant cells. Results show that SF did not inhibit purine or pyrimidine uptake whereas it competitively inhibited AdoMet uptake. Furthermore, the uptake of nucleosides in SF-resistant cells {{is similar to that}} in wild-type cells, whereas uptake of SF and AdoMet is lower...|$|E
40|$|The crystal {{structures}} of the DNA-N 6 -adenine-methyltransferase M·TaqI, in complexes with the cofactor S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) and the competitive inhibitor <b>sinefungin</b> (Sf) show identical folding of the polypeptide chains into two domains. The N-terminal domain carries the cofactor-binding site, the C-terminal domain {{is thought to be}} implicated in sequence-specific DNA binding. Model building of the M·TaqI-DNA complex suggests that the adenine to be methylated swings out of the double helix as found previously in the cytosine-C 5 -MTase HhaI DNA co-crystal structure. A torsion of the methionine moiety of the cofactor is required to bring the methyl group within reach of the swung-out base and allow methyl group transfer...|$|E
40|$|Eubacterial ribosomal large-subunit methyltransferase H (RlmH) methylates 23 S ribosomal RNA pseudouridine 1915 (Psi 1915), {{which lies}} near the ribosomal {{decoding}} center. The smallest {{member of the}} SPOUT superfamily of methyltransferases, RlmH lacks the RNA recognition domain found in larger methyltransferases. The catalytic mechanism of RlmH enzyme is unknown. Here, we describe the structures of RlmH bound to S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) and the methyltransferase inhibitor <b>sinefungin.</b> Our structural and biochemical studies reveal catalytically essential residues in the dimer-mediated asymmetrical active site. One monomer provides the SAM-binding site, whereas the conserved C-terminal tail of the second monomer provides residues essential for catalysis. Our findings elucidate the mechanism by which a small protein dimer assembles a functionally asymmetric architecture...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sinefungin</b> (SFG) is ail {{antifungal}} and antiparasitic nucleoside antibiotic {{composed by}} ornithine and adenosine moieties both having {{the potential to}} bind copper(II). NMR studies performed at physiological pH {{have shown that the}} a-amino and the carboxylate groups in the ornithine unit are the preferred donor sites for Cu(II) binding. On the contrary, at acidic pH, Cu(II) complexation starts from adenosine nitrogen being the a-amino group still protonated and not available for metal binding. The proton paramagnetic relaxation enhancements measured at neutral pH allowed to obtain the 3 D structure of the 1 : 2 Cu(II) -SFG complex. Molecular dynamics calculations were revealing for the existence of secondary Cu(II) interaction with the purine nitrogens of the adenosine moiety...|$|E
