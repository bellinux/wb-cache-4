5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a <b>social</b> <b>construct.</b>|$|E

25|$|Sexual {{objectification}} {{occurs when}} a person is identified by their sexual body parts or sexual function. In essence, an individual loses their identity, and is recognized solely by the physical characteristics of their body.

Sexual objectification can occur as a <b>social</b> <b>construct</b> among individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} tradition, in early sociological {{research}} (around {{the turn of}} the 19th and 20th century), referred to that of the traditional society, as contrasted by the more modern industrial society. This approach was most notably portrayed in Max Weber's concepts of traditional authority and modern rational-legal authority. In more modern works, One hundred years later, sociology sees tradition as a <b>social</b> <b>construct</b> used to contrast past with the present and as a form of rationality used to justify certain course of action.|$|E
40|$|A factor {{analytic}} model is {{proposed for the}} impact of spatially defined latent <b>social</b> <b>constructs</b> on area health outcomes (e. g. mortality or hospitalisation counts). The model has two components or sub-models. The first component is a social indicator measurement model using socioeconomic variables (e. g. from population censuses) as indicators of latent <b>social</b> <b>constructs.</b> The other sub-model considers variations in spatial health outcomes in terms both of the latent <b>social</b> <b>constructs</b> and of residual common factors [...] the latter have only the health variation component as their measurement model. The two sets of latent variables can be mutually correlated and latent scores can be correlated over areas, though the extent of the spatial dependence in the scores on any particular latent variable is determined by the data. A case study application considers the impact of two latent <b>social</b> <b>constructs</b> (denoted as <b>social</b> deprivation and social fragmentation) on four types of psychiatric hospitalisation in 33 local authorities in London, England. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{sexuality}} and gender historian Nancy Cott distinguishes between modern feminism and its antecedents, particularly {{the struggle for}} suffrage. She argues that in the two decades surrounding the Nineteenth Amendment's 1920 passage, the prior woman movement primarily concerned women as universal entities, whereas over this 20-year period, the movement prioritized social differentiation, attention to individuality, and diversity. New issues dealt more with gender as a <b>social</b> <b>construct,</b> gender identity, and relationships within and between genders. Politically, this represented a shift from an ideological alignment comfortable with the right, to one more radically associated with the left.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{given the}} {{component}} of anger as a <b>social</b> <b>construct,</b> difficulty with communication between cultures {{can serve as}} another impediment. What is deemed an appropriate expression of anger is culturally dependent. Therefore, a mismatch between client and therapist {{could result in a}} misunderstanding as to the end goal of the program. For example, a client could only wish to decrease physical violence, while the therapist aims to decrease both verbal and physical outbursts. Gender dependent expectations of anger expression can contribute as well to societal standards. The same violent outburst for a man and woman is subject to different interpretations due to anger being seen as more permissible in males.|$|E

In amicus briefs in important cases, in lobbying before Congress, and in its statements to the public, the MPAA has advocated strong protection of intellectual-property rights. In framing its presentations, the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor. Additionally Congress's awareness {{of the position of}} the United States as the world's largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property. These doctrinal reforms have further strengthened the industry, lending the MPAA even more power and authority.|$|E

25|$|Some {{supporters}} of PMS as a <b>social</b> <b>construct</b> believe PMDD and PMS to be unrelated issues: according to them, PMDD {{is a product}} of brain chemistry, and PMS {{is a product of}} a hypochondriatic culture. Most studies on PMS and PMDD rely solely on self-reporting. According to sociologist Carol Tavris, Western women are socially conditioned to expect PMS or to at least know of its existence, and they therefore report their symptoms accordingly. The anthropologist Emily Martin argues that PMS is a cultural phenomenon that continues to grow in a positive feedback loop, and thus is a social construction that contributes to learned helplessness or convenient excuse. Tavris says that PMS is blamed as an explanation for rage or sadness. The decision to call PMDD an illness has been criticized as inappropriate medicalization. In both cases, they are referring to the emotional aspects, not the normal physical symptoms that are subjectively present.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{religion}} is a <b>social</b> <b>construct,</b> since in other eras, religion, culture, and even national identity were often inseparable. And as for spirituality, {{this is an old}} concept with a new usage. Previous to today’s era, what people today call spirituality was often called piety. Professor of Theology, Linda Mercadante sees religion as a complex adaptive network of myths, symbols, rituals and concepts that simultaneously figure patterns of feeling, thinking, and acting and disrupt stable structures of meaning and purpose. When understood in that way, religion not only involves ideas and practices that are manifestly religious but also includes a broad range of cultural phenomena not ordinarily associated with religion. Many people use spirituality to refer to their interior life of faith and religion to mean the necessary communal and/or organizational part. Mercadante sees both spirituality and religion as consisting of four basic components: beliefs, desire, rituals, and behavioural expectations, but across the field of Religious Studies the definitions vary. When Mercadante has spoken with SBNRs, they take a decidedly anti-dogmatic stance against religious belief in general. They claim not only that belief is non-essential, but that it is potentially harmful or at least a hindrance to spirituality.|$|E

500|$|The {{question}} of race represents {{a major source}} of division among Heathens, particularly in the United States. Within the Heathen community, one viewpoint holds that race is entirely a matter of biological heredity, while the opposing position is that race is a <b>social</b> <b>construct</b> rooted in cultural heritage. In U.S. Heathen discourse, these viewpoints are described as the folkish and the universalist positions, respectively. These two factions—which Kaplan termed the [...] "racialist" [...] and [...] "nonracialist" [...] camps—often clash, with Kaplan claiming that a [...] "virtual civil war" [...] existed between them within the American Heathen community. The universalist and folkish division has also spread to other countries; in contrast to North America and much of Northern Europe, discussions of race rarely arise among the Icelandic Heathen community {{as a result of the}} nation-state's predominantly ethnically homogeneous composition.|$|E

This is a study about gender {{and identity}} {{and the ways in}} which they manifest through the narratives of five transgender individuals, who all transitioned after the age of 45, who now live as women.

The idea that <b>social</b> <b>constructs</b> are intensely powerful is of no great surprise to those reading this paper. However, the way in which this power manifests communicatively in narrative demonstrates a unique influence, one in which there is a full circle result.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Taking advantage of Internet technology, an online community of practice, NETwork, was established to support a group of elementary science pre-service and in-service teachers' learning how to teach. To better understand how teachers can be supported and sustained while participating in an online community of practice, this study investigated the nature of members' participation, members' perceptions of <b>social</b> <b>constructs</b> of online learning experience, and members' learning in a community of practice. Three primary research questions were asked: 1) How do members participate in the primary learning activities through Chat Room discussion, Discussion Board discussion, and information sharing in Resources?; 2) How well does the proposed path model explain the relationships among the <b>social</b> <b>constructs</b> of online learning (i. e. sense of community, social ability, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness) and how well do those <b>social</b> <b>constructs</b> explain community outcomes/effects (satisfaction with NETwork experience and effectiveness of NETwork for Teaching) ?; and 3) How do members' perceptions (sense of community, social ability, ease of use, usefulness, satisfaction with their NETwork experience, and of the effectiveness of NETwork for supporting teaching) change through participating in the community? For research question one, members' log files (Context-aware Activity Notification System data - CANS) were analyzed by social network analysis and visualization techniques to show members' levels and patterns of participation, and qualitative data collected via serial and semester-end interviews and discussion content in the discussion board and chat room were analyzed to triangulate what had been found via CANS data. The results of the analyses show that: 1) Members' levels and patterns of participation varied across time, member types, and tools; 2) Members' identity and levels of participation were reciprocally associated; 3) There were similarities and differences in members' usage of computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools, and members showed growth of their knowledge and skills for teaching via mutual engagement, creating joint enterprise, and establishing shared repertoire supported by CMC tools; and 4) Lack of time influences members' levels of participation. For the second research question, quantitative data collected in the final survey were analyzed via path analysis to examine the relationships among the <b>social</b> <b>constructs.</b> The final model of primary <b>social</b> <b>constructs</b> was found to explain how members' perceptions of sense of community (SOC), social ability (SA), and perceived ease of use (PEU) and usefulness (PU) of Sakai tools account for 74 % and 80 % of variance respectively for members' satisfaction with NETwork experience and effectiveness of NETwork for Teaching. Also, the relationships among sub-constructs of SA and other <b>social</b> <b>constructs</b> provided further understanding of how social navigation, social presence with peers, and social presence with instructors related to members' perceptions of PEU and PU, SOC, and S. For research question three, data collected in both the first and final surveys were analyzed via dependent-sample t test and qualitative data collected in both the serial and semester-end interviews were analyzed to examine changes in members' perceptions of <b>social</b> <b>constructs.</b> The results show that members' perceptions of <b>social</b> <b>constructs</b> significantly changed after participating in NETwork activities although some <b>social</b> <b>constructs</b> might need more time for changes to be significant. Also, members believe that participating in NETwork is helpful for their current and future teaching...|$|R
