50|$|The cotton bollworm, {{corn earworm}} or Old World (African) bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, (also {{known as the}} <b>scarce</b> <b>bordered</b> <b>straw</b> in the UK, where it is a migrant) is a moth, the larvae of which feed {{on a wide range}} of plants, {{including}} many important cultivated crops. It is a major pest in cotton and one of the most polyphagous and cosmopolitan pest species. It should not be confused with the similarly named, related species Helicoverpa zea.|$|E

It is found in Southern Europe and the Near East, but can be found further north too, {{because it is a}} migratory species. It is also present in most of Africa and in Asia, ranging to China and Laos.|$|R

Once, indeed, he said something of it, and I put it off with a kind of a jest. [...] "Alas!" [...] says I, [...] "those things are out of the question now; 'tis almost two ages since those things were talked between us," [...] says I. [...] "You see I am grown an old woman since that." [...] Another time he gave a little push at it again, and I laughed again. [...] "Why, what dost thou talk of?" [...] said I in a formal way. [...] "Dost thou not see I am turned Quaker? I cannot speak of those things now." [...] "Why," [...] says he, [...] "the Quakers marry as well as other people, and love one another as well. Besides," [...] says he, [...] "the Quakers' dress does not ill become you," [...] and so jested with me again, and so it went off for a third time. However, I began to be kind to him in process of time, as they call it, and we grew very intimate; and if the following accident had not unluckily intervened, I had certainly married him, or consented to marry him, the very next time he had asked me.|$|R
40|$|Although the {{majority}} of illegalised migrants in the European Union are so-called ‘visa overstayers’ who enter with a Schengen visa only to become ‘illegal’ once it has expired, this mode of illegalised migration has only received <b>scarce</b> attention in <b>border</b> and migration studies so far. This article takes the introduction of biometric technologies in the Schengen visa regime {{as an opportunity to}} compensate for this neglect by asking: How do migrants appropriate Schengen visa in the context of biometric border controls? Drawing on the autonomy of migration approach (AoM), it investigates the visa regime from the perspective of mobility in order to elaborate on one set of practices of appropriation that involves the provision of falsified or manipulated supporting documents upon which the decision to issue a biometric visa is based. The article draws on this example to develop a conception of the notion of appropriation that addresses the two central criticisms that have been raised against the AoM. Besides contributing {{to the development of the}} AoM, the article thus introduces a concept in debates on migrant agency that highlights, better than existing concepts, the intricate intertwinement of migrants’ practices with the actors, means and methods of mobility control...|$|R
50|$|At {{the city}} limits, the seven dwarves, led by Grumpy/Leroy (Lee Arenberg), congregate {{at the line}} of the town's <b>border.</b> They pick <b>straws</b> to see who will be the one to cross it and Sneezy is the unfortunate winner. As the first victim of what happens when {{residents}} leave Storybrooke, he loses the memories of his fairytale life and completely becomes his Storybrooke persona, Tom Clark. Meanwhile, as the residents are trying to clean up after the wraith's attack, Geppetto/Marco (Tony Amendola) is putting missing person signs up, hoping to find Pinocchio. Prince Charming/David (Josh Dallas) goes to Regina's house to demand answers about the Mad Hatter/Jefferson's (Sebastian Stan) hat and how to get Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) and Snow White/Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) back, but Regina pretends she doesn't know how and says she is more concerned about Henry (Jared S. Gilmore). When Charming asks the Blue Fairy/Mother Superior (Keegan Connor Tracy) if there is any way that can send them back, she tells him that there is no fairy dust to make it work. At that moment, the dwarves return and explain what happened to Sneezy after he crossed the city limits, causing the displaced characters to panic. Charming tells the citizens to meet back in two hours and he will tell them his plan.|$|R
6000|$|WOULD {{you that}} Delville I describe? Believe me, Sir, I will not gibe: For {{who would be}} satirical Upon a thing so very small? [...] You <b>scarce</b> upon the <b>borders</b> enter, Before you're at the very centre. A single crow can make it night, When o'er your farm she takes her flight: Yet, in this narrow compass, we Observe a vast variety; Both walks, walls, meadows, and parterres, Windows and doors, and rooms and stairs, And hills and dales, and woods and fields, And hay, and grass, and corn, it yields: All to your haggard brought so cheap in, Without the mowing or the reaping: A razor, though to say't I'm loth, Would shave you and your meadows both. [...] Though small's the farm, yet here's a house Full large to {{entertain}} a mouse; But where a rat is dreaded more Than savage Caledonian boar; For, if it's enter'd by a rat, There is no room to bring a cat. [...] A little rivulet seems to steal Down through a thing you call a vale, Like tears adown a wrinkled cheek, Like rain along a blade of leek: And this you call your sweet meander, Which might be suck'd up by a gander, Could he but force his nether bill To scoop the channel of the rill. For sure you'd make a mighty clutter, Were it as big as city gutter. Next come I to your kitchen garden, Where one poor mouse would fare but hard in; And round this garden is a walk No longer than a tailor's chalk; Thus I compare what space is in it, A snail creeps round it in a minute. One lettuce makes a shift to squeeze Up through a tuft you call your trees: And, once a year, a single rose Peeps from the bud, but never blows; In vain then you expect its bloom! It cannot blow for want of room. [...] In short, in all your boasted seat, There's nothing but yourself that's GREAT.|$|R
