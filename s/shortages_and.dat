5|$|After {{nationalisation}} after World War II the National Coal Board spent £500,000 on modernising the mine's {{infrastructure to}} give it the capability for annual production of 315,000tons, however manpower <b>shortages</b> <b>and</b> geological problems caused the pit to close in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Because Israel's {{victory was}} {{largely due to}} U.S. support, the Arab OPEC nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude oil to the U.S., {{resulting}} in the 1973 oil crisis. The embargo caused gasoline <b>shortages</b> <b>and</b> rationing in the United States in late 1973, and was eventually ended by the oil-producing nations as peace in the Middle East took hold.|$|E
5|$|Fighter pilots {{received}} no instrument training until very {{late in the}} war, after the training course had already been curtailed because of fuel <b>shortages</b> <b>and</b> the need to produce pilots more quickly to replace losses. Galland also did not make sure all-weather flying was incorporated into pilot training, which was of decisive importance in an effective air defence force.|$|E

5|$|The camp dietitian, {{with the}} help of men {{assigned}} as cooks, prepared all of the meals. Camps with large gardens provided their own fresh vegetables.

5|$|The {{civilian}} {{death rate}} exceeded the prewar level by 292,000, which included 109,000 deaths due to food <b>shortages</b> <b>and</b> 183,577 from Spanish Flu. The 1922 War Office report detailed {{the deaths of}} 1,260 civilians and 310 military personnel due to air and sea bombardment the home islands.

5|$|The common {{soldiers}} fought bravely at first, {{but they}} were saddled with low pay (with which they had to purchase their own food and medical care), ammunition <b>shortages,</b> <b>and</b> mixed equipment. Due to the pay system, there were no allotments for their families, who were, therefore, forced to follow their husbands/sons into the battle zones. These problems (exacerbated by continuously declining morale) only increased over time.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for the two ships was awarded to Tomlinson and Hartupee Co. on 16 May 1862. Construction was at their yard in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Progress was slow, delayed by labor <b>shortages</b> <b>and</b> changes by the navy. The US government allocated $188,000 each {{for the construction of}} Marietta and Sandusky, but the final cost rose to $235,039 after charges for extra work.|$|E
5|$|This {{engagement}} was {{the turning}} point of the Prussians' campaign. Beset with food <b>shortages</b> <b>and</b> dysentery, their retreat continued well past the Rhine River. French troops soon struck forward into Germany, taking Mainz in October. Dumouriez once again moved against the Austrian Netherlands and Kellermann ably secured the front at Metz.|$|E

To meet the <b>shortage</b> <b>and</b> bring the cost of housing down, a new form of construction was pioneered, commonly called ‘PRC’ (Pre-cast Reinforced Concrete).|$|R
5|$|Chesapeake was a 38-gun wooden-hulled, three-masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy. She {{was one of}} the {{original}} six frigates whose construction was authorized by the Naval Act of 1794. Joshua Humphreys designed these frigates to be the young navy's capital ships. Chesapeake was originally designed as a 44-gun frigate but construction delays, material <b>shortages,</b> <b>and</b> budget problems caused builder Josiah Fox to alter her design to 38guns. Launched at the Gosport Navy Yard on 2December 1799, Chesapeake began her career during the Quasi-War with France and saw service in the First Barbary War.|$|E
5|$|Massive {{numbers of}} workers were needed, the Vichy regime imposed a {{compulsory}} labour system, drafting some 600,000 French workers to construct these permanent fortifications along the Dutch, Belgian, and French coasts facing the English Channel. Efficiency of the OT decreased in late 1943 and 1944 {{as a result}} of manpower pressures, fuel <b>shortages</b> <b>and</b> the bombing of worksites, such as V-weapons sites, where some volunteer workers refused to work in such dangerous areas.|$|E
5|$|North Korean troops, {{hampered}} by supply <b>shortages</b> <b>and</b> massive losses, continually staged attacks on UN forces {{in an attempt}} to penetrate the perimeter and collapse the line. However, the UN used the port to amass an overwhelming advantage in troops, equipment, and logistics, and its navy and air forces remained unchallenged by the North Koreans during the fight. After six weeks, the North Korean force collapsed and retreated in defeat after the UN force launched a counterattack at Inchon on September 15. The battle would be the furthest the North Korean troops would advance in the war, as subsequent fighting ground the war into a stalemate.|$|E

5|$|On October 29 and 30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused {{extensive}} {{destruction in}} the borough, ravaging portions of Lower Manhattan with record-high storm surge from New York Harbor, severe flooding, and high winds, causing power outages {{for hundreds of}} thousands of city residents and leading to gasoline <b>shortages</b> <b>and</b> disruption of mass transit systems. The storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the borough and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future. Around 15 percent of the borough is considered to be in flood-risk zones.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Brigade, {{less the}} 36th Battalion, was {{gradually}} {{brought into the}} Jacquinot Bay area, with its final elements arriving on 16 December. Due to shipping <b>shortages</b> <b>and</b> the low priority given to building up forces on New Britain, {{it was not until}} April 1945 that all elements of the 5th Division had been brought forward to Jacquinot Bay. The company from the 594th Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment remained at Jacquinot Bay until it was replaced by the 41st Australian Landing Craft Company on 15 February 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Dardanelles Commission, {{including}} Fisher, interviewed {{witnesses in}} 1916 and 1917 and issued its final report in 1919. It {{concluded that the}} expedition was poorly planned and executed and that difficulties had been underestimated, problems which were exacerbated by supply <b>shortages</b> <b>and</b> by personality clashes and procrastination at high levels. Some 480,000 Allied troops had been dedicated to the failed campaign, with around half in casualties. The report's conclusions were regarded as insipid with no figures (political or military) heavily censured. The report of the Commission and information gathered by the inquiry remain a key source of documents on the campaign.|$|E

5|$|The {{return of}} Australian {{personnel}} from the SWPA was delayed by shipping <b>shortages</b> <b>and</b> {{the need to}} maintain a force in the area for garrison duties. The military provided these personnel with training courses to prepare them for civilian life. Refresher courses in basic subjects such as maths and English were run first before vocational training began. The teachers and instructors for these courses were service personnel {{selected on the basis of}} their civilian occupations. In addition, sport competitions were conducted to keep the men busy.|$|E
5|$|After Egypt's central {{government}} collapsed {{at the end}} of the Old Kingdom, the administration could no longer support or stabilize the country's economy. Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and the ensuing food <b>shortages</b> <b>and</b> political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the pharaoh, used their new-found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources, the provinces became economically richer—which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes. In bursts of creativity, provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the optimism and originality of the period.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of World War I in August 1914, Wittelsbach was brought back to active duty in the IV Battle Squadron. The ship saw limited duty in the Baltic Sea, {{including}} during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, but she saw no combat with Russian forces. By late 1915, crew <b>shortages</b> <b>and</b> the threat from British submarines forced the Kaiserliche Marine to withdraw older battleships like Wittelsbach. The ship then saw service in auxiliary roles, first as a training ship {{and then as a}} ship's tender. After the war, she was converted into a tender for minesweepers in 1919. In July 1921, the ship was sold and broken up for scrap metal.|$|E
