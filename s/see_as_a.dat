5|$|The Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has {{proposed}} that this pyramid was initially intended for queen Meresankh IV, whom he and Verner <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> wife of Djedkare. Seipel contends that Meresankh was finally {{buried in a}} smaller mastaba in Saqqara North after she fell into disgrace. Alternatively, Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton have proposed {{that she was a}} wife of the preceding king, Menkauhor Kaiu.|$|E
5|$|Johann Lamont {{was born}} in the Anderston {{district}} of Glasgow on 11 July 1957. Her parents, Archie and Effie, were both Gaelic speakers from crofting families on the Inner Hebridean island of Tiree, who met after both had moved to Glasgow. Archie was a carpenter employed by the Scottish ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne, working on the Mallaig to Skye route. He took part in the Seamen's Strike of 1966. The family were Presbyterians, and Lamont's mother was influenced in her faith by the American evangelist Billy Graham. Her first experiences of public speakers was listening to the preachers her mother took her to <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> girl.|$|E

5|$|The monks of Winchester {{had already}} elected {{one of their}} own number, but this was over-ruled, and Edington was consecrated in 1346. As a bishop he was {{necessarily}} much absent, even with the relatively short distance between Westminster and Winchester. He was not entirely detached from his episcopal duties, however: he used the <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> source for extensive nepotism, yet he also initiated wide-ranging building works on the nave of the cathedral. Meanwhile, in 1351, he founded an Augustinian priory at his birthplace of Edington, to have prayers said for himself, his parents and his brother. Although most of the priory has been demolished, the church still stands, as {{a good example of the}} transition between the decorated and perpendicular style of church-building.|$|E
5|$|In 1613, {{his sister}} Elizabeth married Frederick V, Elector Palatine, {{and moved to}} Heidelberg. In 1617, the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, a Catholic, was elected king of Bohemia. The {{following}} year, the Bohemians rebelled, defenestrating the Catholic governors. In August 1619, the Bohemian diet chose as their monarch FrederickV, who was leader of the Protestant Union, while Ferdinand was elected Holy Roman Emperor in the imperial election. Frederick's acceptance of the Bohemian crown {{in defiance of the}} emperor {{marked the beginning of the}} turmoil that would develop into the Thirty Years' War. The conflict, originally confined to Bohemia, spiralled into a wider European war, which the English Parliament and public quickly grew to <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> polarised continental struggle between Catholics and Protestants. In 1620, Charles's brother-in-law, Frederick V, was defeated at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague and his hereditary lands in the Electoral Palatinate were invaded by a Habsburg force from the Spanish Netherlands. James, however, had been seeking marriage between the new Prince of Wales and Ferdinand's niece, Habsburg princess Maria Anna of Spain, and began to see the Spanish match as a possible diplomatic means of achieving peace in Europe.|$|E

40|$|When {{modelling}} a domain, it {{is often}} the case that certain individuals are represented as belonging to multiple categories, generating therefore "tangled" hierarchies: 1. A physical object can be <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> amount of matter 2. A hole can be <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> region of space 3. A building can be <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> place 4.

A physical object can be <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> temporal process This phenomenon is quite common: the examples above have been taken from existing toplevel ontologies used in practice, and they are responsible, in our opinion, of many situations of tangleness, confusion, and lack of semantic rigour. We advocate in the present paper a design principle aimed to clarify such situations and produce more reusable and well-founded ontologies.

25|$|Computer {{vision is}} {{the science and}} {{technology}} of machines that <b>see.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> scientific discipline, computer vision {{is concerned with the}} theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images.

25|$|The great trouvère Chrétien de Troyes {{claims to}} have written a Tristan story, though {{no part of it}} has ever been found.

Some scholars speculate his Tristan was ill-received, prompting Chretien to write Cligès - a story with no Celtic antecedent - to make amends.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} who call the USDA 'the last plantation.' An 'old line' department, USDA {{was one of the}} last federal {{agencies}} to integrate and perhaps the last to include women and minorities in leadership positions.

25|$|Allred {{used the}} Pauling method to {{calculate}} separate electronegativities for different oxidation {{states of the}} handful of elements (including tin and lead) for which sufficient data was available. However, for most elements, {{there are not enough}} different covalent compounds for which bond dissociation energies are known to make this approach feasible. This is particularly true of the transition elements, where quoted electronegativity values are usually, of necessity, averages over several different oxidation states and where trends in electronegativity are harder to <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result.|$|E
25|$|At {{the peak}} of his {{creative}} powers, Kelly made what in retrospect some <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mistake. In December 1951, he signed a contract with MGM that sent him to Europe for nineteen months to use MGM funds frozen in Europe to make three pictures while personally benefiting from tax exemptions. Only one of these pictures was a musical, Invitation to the Dance, a pet project of Kelly's to bring modern ballet to mainstream film audiences. It was beset with delays and technical problems, and flopped when finally released in 1956.|$|E
25|$|The Sneinton Dragon {{is a large}} {{sculpture}} {{that stands}} at the junction of Colwick Loop Road and Sneinton Hermitage. Made from stainless steel, it was created by local craftsman Robert Stubley after residents of Sneinton were asked by the Renewal Trust what {{they would like to}} <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> piece of public art to represent their area. It was commissioned by Nottingham City Council and was unveiled on 21 November 2006. The dragon stands 7 feet tall, has a wingspan of 15 feet and took 3 months to finish. During the Christmas period the dragon receives a Santa hat, which often disappears within days. There also are three other sculptures in Sneinton.|$|E

25|$|During {{the visit}} of Queen Elizabeth II to Alberta and Saskatchewan in 2005, First Nations stated that they felt relegated to a merely {{ceremonial}} role, having been denied by federal and provincial ministers any access to the Queen in private audience. First Nations leaders have also raised concerns about what they <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> crumbling relationship between their people and the Crown, fueled {{by the failure of}} the federal and provincial cabinets to resolve land claim disputes, as well as a perceived intervention of the Crown into aboriginal affairs. Formal relations have also not yet been founded between the monarchy and a number of First Nations around Canada; such as those in British Columbia who are still engaged in the process of treaty making.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, just as some {{scholars}} praise what they <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{confirmation of the}} compatibility of Islam and gender equality, others point out that by requiring the framing of gender equality within an Islamic framework, {{the means by which}} Muslim women can advocate for equality is inherently limited. This process also arguably reduces Islamic women to a single, universal category that does not recognize their individual choices. Critics consequently point out that the Mudawana represents an improvement in women's status but still falls short of establishing their full equal standing with men in either the family or the social sphere. For example, the law still recognizes the father as head of the family and designates him the default legal tutor to his children.|$|E
25|$|In 1852, he {{ultimately}} resigned as commissioner, expressing his protest toward {{the treatment of}} Romanians by the Austrian government. However, {{he was asked to}} reconsider by the authorities, who feared that they were becoming unpopular with the majority population. Although he did not resume his earlier posting, he went on to serve as president of the Central Commission in Temeschwar (Timișoara); he was also a counsel for the Austrian Court of Cassation. He resigned all positions in the state apparatus in 1856, and withdrew to Foeni. This decision was cemented in 1858 by the death of brother Petru, killed by his own landlord or doorman in Pest. The killing, which some authors <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> political assassination, ended with a celebrity trial in which Emanoil Gojdu represented the Mocionis as plaintiffs.|$|E
