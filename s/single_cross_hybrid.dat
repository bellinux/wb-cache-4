40|$|ABSTRACT Changes in {{quantity}} and quality of corn crop stover can have a large impact on soil conservation and soil carbon (C) sequestration over large areas. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate changes in production, concentration and amount of C and nitrogen (N) in corn stover fractions due to cultivar development. Two field experiments were conducted in the city of Rolândia (Paraná State, Brazil) using ten cultivars representing five technological levels: <b>single</b> <b>cross</b> <b>hybrids,</b> double or triple hybrids, commercial varieties, and creole cultivars. Plant heights and stalk, leaf, cob, husk and tassel weights were determined at final harvest. Elemental C and N analyses were performed in triplicate for each stover fraction. In general, the creole cultivars had greater height, more dry matter (kg ha- 1) and C content (kg ha- 1) in husks, leaves, tassels and stalks, particularly when compared to <b>single</b> <b>cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> or others hybrids. There was a direct relationship between C/N ratio and corn selection for husks in both years and for the others fractions in one study year. This was due to the combined effects of increasing C and decreasing N due to crop selection. Large differences were observed within the same technological levels for the evaluated properties, suggesting a wide variation in genetic background.

These studies were conducted to investigate the effects of defoliation and reduction in plant density on the growth and yield of corn. Both the defoliation and stand reduction experiments were layed out in randomized complete-block design, with seven replications for each study. ^ Normal leaf type NC + 85 hybrid corn was planted {{at the rate of}} 69, 160 kernels/ha. on May 11, 1979, and May 7, 1980 for the defoliation study. Upright leaf type, <b>single</b> <b>cross</b> <b>hybrid</b> corn, NC + 59 was planted on May 11 and May 8 in 1979 and 1980, respectively, at the rate of 74, 100 kernels/ha. for the stand reduction study. The stand reduction experiment was later thinned to 69, 160, 59, 280, 49, 400, 39, 520, and 29, 640 plants/ha. The 69, 160 plants/ha. was used as the control. Both hybrids used in the experiments are full-season hybrids with a 120 -day maturity rating. Reduction in plant density was at the 6, 9, 12, and 15 leaf stages. The defoliation study consisted of cutting off the corn plants at 2. 5 cm. above the growing point at the 4 through the 9 leaf stages, while reduction in plant density involved completely removing randomly selected corn plants until desired population density was attained. ^ The characters studied included plant height, leaf area and leaf area index, ear height, stem diameter, dry matter, shelling percentage and grain yield. ^ Defoliation treatments resulted in a linear decrease in plant height and ear height. Leaf area and leaf area index were significantly reduced by defoliation. Stem diameter linearly declined with defoliation at successive leaf stages. All defoliation treatments reduced dry matter from that of the control. Grain yields were increased by defoliation at the 5 leaf stage. Even though there was an increase in grain yield by defoliating corn plants at the 5 leaf stage, this increase over the control was only 1 %. Apart from this increase, all other defoliation treatments significantly reduced yields. ^ Reducing corn plant density from 59, 280 plants/ha. to 29, 640 plants/ha. reduced grain yield. For the <b>single</b> <b>cross</b> <b>hybrid,</b> NC + 59 used in the experiment, data obtained suggest that a population density of 49, 400 plants/ha. to 59, 280 plants/ha. is the most stable for grain production. ...|$|E

Historic heritability scenarios of five traits and other genetic architecture settings were used to compare models, evaluating the predictive ability and estimation of variance components. Marginal differences were detected between the multivariate and univariate models. The main explanation for the small discrepancy between models is the low- to moderate-magnitude correlations between the traits studied and moderate heritabilities.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to evaluate single cross hybrids of maize (Zea mays L.) obtained from partial diallel crosses among contrasting inbred lines, to estimate the combining ability of the lines and to verify whether the genetic diversity among those lines assessed by moleculars markers is correlated with <b>single</b> <b>cross</b> <b>hybrid</b> heterosis Thirty-six single-crosses resulting from partial diallel and the 12 parental lines were evaluated in Campinas, State of São Paulo, in randomized block design, with tree replicates and two commercial checks. The following traits were evaluated: plant and ear height, ear weight and grain weight. Individual variance analysis of hybrids were performed, and the averages were compared by Tukey test (P< 0. 05). General combining ability of the lines was obtained according to Geraldi e Miranda Filho. Correlations among matrices were estimated through Mantel statistics, considering heterosis, yield and specific combining ability with genetic divergence assessed by AFLP and SSR. The hybrid PM 624 × P 398 exhibited outstanding yield capacity and the lines VER 266 and L 105 showed positive GCA for grain yield. Estimate heterosis ranged from - 559 to 6. 320 kg ha- 1. No significant correlation was observed between heterosis, specific combination ability or grain yield with genetic distance assessed by AFLP and SSR. Therefore, no prediction of hybrids performance could {{be made on the}} basis of the genetic divergence of the parent lines...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of two sunflower genotypes (Morden and MSFH- 8) {{with and without}} VA-mycorrhizal fungi at three P levels (38, 56 and 75 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1) in vertisol of Dharwad was studied {{to determine the effect}} of mycorrhizal inoculation on plant growth, yield and P uptake. The results showed that the VAM inoculation increased sunflower yield (14 %), total biomass (16 %), oil content (3. 1 %) and P uptake (30. 5 %) over uninoculated control. The percent root colonization and chlamydo-spore count decreased with increasing P levels. The total biomass production, seed yield and P uptake of mycorrhizal plants at 38 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1 more than the non-mycorrhizal plants at 75 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1. The biomass and seed yield of mycorrhizal plants at same P level were more than the non-mycorrhizal plants. Mycorrhizal plants of Morden at 38 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1 and MSFH- 8 at 56 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1 produced higher seed yield, oil content and total biomass than non-mycorrhizal plants supplied with 75 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1. The results indicated that, VA-mycorrhizal inoculation helps in saving 25 and 50 percent of recommended dose of phosphatic fertilizer (75 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1) in MSFH- 8 (<b>single</b> <b>cross</b> <b>hybrid)</b> and Morden (open pollinated variety), respectively...|$|E

Twelve commercial <b>single</b> <b>cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> were evaluated in a randomizedblock design with three replications. Five evaluations of disease severity were performed using a visual symptomsscale, ranging from 1 (highly resistant) to 9 (highly susceptible). Fungicide application was effective in the control ofmaize leaf diseases, and the reduced incidence of kernel rot provided on average 12 % increased grain yield comparedto the control treatment.

40|$|Drought {{and heat}} stress are major abiotic {{stresses}} limiting maize production in Zimbabwe and Africa at large. It {{is of great}} importance to evaluate the breeding value of combined drought and heat stress donor parents for development of new and locally adapted maize hybrids. A North Carolina Design II (NCDII) mating scheme was used for crossing 10 combined drought and heat stress tolerant donor lines and six adapted CIMMYT Zimbabwe lines. The cross combinations that were successfully pollinated resulted {{in a total of}} 30 <b>single</b> <b>cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> and five stress tolerant donor parents were dropped from the evaluations as they did not have all cross combinations with the testers. These <b>single</b> <b>cross</b> <b>hybrids</b> were evaluated under optimum, sandy and managed drought conditions using a 0. 1 alpha lattice design with two replications in the 2013 - 14 summer and winter season. The objectives of this study were (i) to estimate combining ability effects among the drought and heat stress tolerant donors and CIMMYT Zimbabwe adapted maize inbred lines, (ii) to classify the stress tolerant donor lines into heterotic group A and B using CML 312 and CML 444 as testers and (iii) to evaluate GXE interaction of the <b>single</b> <b>crosses</b> developed. For grain yield and other secondary traits evaluated across environments, significant GCA and SCA effects indicated the importance of both additive and non-additive gene effects in the expression of these traits. Additive gene action contributed more to genotypic variation amongst testcrosses for the traits measured as evidenced by the higher mean squares for lines and testers than their interaction. For grain yield, additive gene action due to females had much contribution to the genotypic variation therefore highlighting the importance of maternal effects in the expression of this trait. The basis used for tester identification was good GCA effects for grain yield. Lines CL 1215159, CL 133480, CML 395 and CML 444 showed good GCA. For heterotic grouping using CML 312 and CML 444 as testers, lines CL 1215159, VL 062656 and CL 1215158 were classified in heterotic group A and CL 1215157 and CL 133480 were classified in group B. In heterotic group A, the <b>single</b> <b>cross</b> CL 1215159 x CML 312 was identified and in heterotic group B, CL 133480 x CML 444 was identified as potential <b>single</b> <b>cross</b> testers.

40|$|Choice of an {{appropriate}} donor of alleles {{for use in}} reselection programs of existing inbred lines of maize (Zea mays L.) {{is crucial to the}} success of such programs. Well-adapted local inbred lines might be used as donors to improve a target genotype. The objectives of this study were to: (i) evaluate Serbian maize inbred lines as donors of favorable alleles for improvement of a <b>single</b> <b>cross</b> <b>hybrid</b> and (ii) estimate Dudley’s relationship values to determine which inbred parent should be improved. Evaluation of four donor lines as sources of new favorable alleles for the yield of grain yield not present in the elite hybrid parent line was conducted, (Dudley, 1987 a; 1987 b). Each of the potential donors had significant values of the parameter μG, so they can be used as the sources of new alleles in the improvement of elite hybrid A 654 × Fu 4 yield. The greatest number of favorable new alleles for the improvement of grain yield of hybrid A 654 × Fu 4 was recorded in inbred line ZPLB 368. The improvement of yield in hybrid A 654 × Fu 4 would be conducted by improving inbred parent Fu 4, since all donor lines showed higher genetic parentage with this parent than with A 654. The best way for developing initial population is self-fertilization of F 1 generation (P w × Fu 4), which would allow greatest probability for obtaining new lines (improved Fu 4) ...|$|E
40|$|Five inbreds (UDL 1, UDL 4, UDL 5, UDL 6, 126) {{from our}} {{preliminary}} maize improvement program for increased starch content {{and some of}} their hybrids were grown in 2008 at the field of Horticultural Institute, Debrecen University. Three chemical parameters (starch-, protein-, oil content) and the weighing of one physical trait (thousand-kernel weight) were analyzed. The starch content varied from 64. 29 – 70. 80 % in lines and from 70. 84 – 72. 29 % in case of hybrids. Protein content in the dry material was between 9. 04 – 12. 62 % in case of the parent lines and it was 7. 61 – 9. 56 % in the single cross hybrids. Strong negative correlation (r = − 0. 834 **) was found between starch and protein content of the examined hybrids. The oil content varied from 2. 70 – 3. 64 % and 2. 87 – 3. 39 % in lines and hybrids, respectively. The thousand-kernel weight (TKW) varied between 213. 6 – 341. 3 g in case of the lines and it was 314. 3 - 426. 3 g in hybrids. Significant differences were found among hybrids in TKW (SD 5 % = 34. 66 %). Heterosis was experienced in the starch content of UDH 6 hybrid.

40|$|Fusarium stalk rot (FSR) and {{anthracnose}} stalk rot (ASR), {{caused by}} Fusarium spp. and Colletotrichum graminicola (Ces.) G. W. Wils. respectively, {{are the two}} most important stalk diseases in maize which increase the incidence of stalk lodging and reduce grain yield. The aim {{of the present study was}} to (1) evaluate the effect of four cycles of recurrent selection in the Maksimir 3 Synthetic (M 3 S) maize population on ASR and FSR resistance and (2) to investigate the correlation among the different disease rating methods. The experiment included six M 3 S cycle populations per se and their test-crosses with a <b>single</b> <b>cross</b> <b>hybrid.</b> ASR resistance was estimated on artificially inoculated plant rows using three ratings (the number of infected internodes, the number of internodes rotten more than 75 % and evaluation of outer stalk discoloration) whereas FSR resistance was estimated in artificially inoculated rows as well as in naturally inoculated rows by rating severity of disease symptoms on longitudinally cut stalks using the standard resistance scale. The results of the present study showed that four cycles of selection in the M 3 S maize population, conducted primarily for grain yield improvement, did not significantly affect its resistance to both ASR and FSR. Among the disease ratings a moderate positive correlation was found only between two ASR resistance ratings (the number of infected internodes and the number of internodes rotted more than 75 %) in both population per se (r= 0. 49 **) and population test-crosses (r= 0. 56 **) ...|$|E
