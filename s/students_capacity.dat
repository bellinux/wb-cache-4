40|$|Dengue {{has been}} a {{critical}} problem for an Islamic School, Nakhon Si Thammarat province, Southern Thailand. Objectives: 1) to build student capacity; and 2) to evaluate the results of <b>student</b> <b>capacity</b> building. Method: Participatory Action Research: PAR was applied in three phases: 1) the school-based preparation phase; 2) {{the process of building}} <b>student</b> <b>capacity</b> phase, and 3) evaluation {{of the results of the}} <b>student</b> <b>capacity</b> building. Independent T-Test statistical method was used to analyze <b>student</b> <b>capacity</b> both before and after the intervention. Larval Indices were determined through ratio analysis. Results: Prior to the intervention, there was no clear strategy for combating dengue. In this study, three groups were formed to build student capacity: a leader group, a non-leader group, and a support group. The leader group (48 student leaders), critical to the study, was set as a dengue club named “Eliminate Ades Aegypti, the culprit of dengue” which focused on eight sets of activities: “Dengue or Death”, “Seniors educating juniors”, “Reward for good answers”, “Dengue monitoring team”, “Youth to expel mosquetoes”, “Mosquito or busy”, “Garbage elimination of Pondok”, and “Essential doctors”. The level of <b>student</b> <b>capacity</b> for the prevention and control of dengue of a sampling of 308 student representatives of the Pondok (Islamic school) showed an increase after intervention ((SD); 56. 78 (17. 06); 65. 33 (15. 36) and different statistic significant (P < 0. 001). The Larval indices ratio levels had decreased from the original levels (BI = 244, HI = 45, and CI = 26) after intervention (BI = 137, HI = 39, and CI = 19). Dengue morbidity and mortality rates were not found during the study. Discussion: Although there had been an increase in <b>student</b> <b>capacity,</b> a decrease in the larval indices ratio, and the absence of a dengue epidemiology index, the high risk of a dengue epidemic might still be found in the school because the ratio of larval indices were higher than the standard index. Then, the committed participation of students, school, and communities around the school vicinity is needed in building <b>student</b> <b>capacity</b> of dengue prevention and control...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{portfolio}} {{model was}} developed which {{can serve as}} an alternative to the literature study with practical processing, the predominant dissertation model used in teacher education courses in Flanders. Using a pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design with 174 teacher students and 44 supervisors, we examined whether the use of portfolio as a dissertation model has a greater effect on the <b>students</b> <b>capacity</b> for independent learning than the literature study with practical processing, using three questionnaires. The research shows that portfolio results in students acquiring greater metacognitive knowledge. It also appears that students only get the chance to use their metacognitive skills when supervisors give them sufficient autonomy. However, supervisors experience loss of control and therefore tend to restrict students autonomy. This leads us to the paradox of independent learning: students will only learn independently when they are given the opportunity to learn independently. Supervisors need to transfer learner control...|$|E
40|$|Case-based {{teaching}} (CBT) tutorials {{were introduced}} by the Physiology Department at Adelaide University {{to bridge the gap}} between theory and practice in the early years of undergraduate medical education. With the use of a clinical case-based environment, CBT aimed to achieve integration of structure-function relationships and an increase in <b>students</b> <b>capacity</b> to apply a physiological understanding to clinical observations/symptoms and data. With peer-peer interactions in small groups, students could trial history taking and examination skills, interpret common investigations, and relate their findings to an understanding of structure and function. Here, the cardiovascular tutorials highlight the centrality of an understanding of structure and function in the evaluation of a case of syncope. An independent evaluation of the students learning experience demonstrated that CBT tutorials were successful in their aims. The 2 ̆ 2 hands-on 2 ̆ 2 experience was highly rated, with students reporting that the CBT approach gave relevance to structure and function. Whatever the curriculum learning style, underpinning practice with an understanding of theory remains a desirable feature of medical education.

40|$|Capacity {{building}} {{both for}} students and for community partners is an explicit goal for one particular teaching and learning innovation in Irish higher education. In addition to offering the opportunity to apply discipline-specific knowledge and skills, community-engaged learning (or service learning) aims to develop <b>students</b> <b>capacity</b> for autonomy, insight and active citizenship while meeting community needs and building community capacity. A central role of the academic is to plan a curriculum for civic engagement a process which includes attending to values, outcomes, pedagogy, assessment and evaluation which captures the diverse goals of the pedagogy, while meeting the requirements of a credit-based framework and related quality assurance systems. Academics have demonstrated considerable ingenuity {{in their ability to}} do this, often with the aid of educational developers who have supported these developments. Â  The chapter focuses on the process by which academics design/redesign curricula to embed a civic dimension with the potential for capacity building for all partners in the process and the inherent tensions in that endeavour. A range of strategies which have been deployed in practice will be outlined as will a typology of approaches to curriculum design for the pedagogy. The implications of different curriculum design for the sustainability of the pedagogy are also examined, especially within the challenging and demanding milieu of contemporary higher education.
