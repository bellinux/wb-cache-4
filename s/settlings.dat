Goodin. While Goodin argues that 'settling' {{should be considered}} a 'normatively defensible practice', my critique focuses on his assumed link between 'settling' in general and settler colonialism in particular. The first section of this article follows the narrative of settlement that underpins Goodin's book. The second section discusses this narrative's inherently exclusionary character, a characteristic that undermines claims to universal normative validity; while the third section appraises the language that supports it. In the fourth, conclusive, section On <b>Settling's</b> apology of settler colonialism is used {{as a starting point for}} an analysis of the settler colonial present in an 'age of unsettlement'...|$|R

But to tell the truth, I never was a very forward old fellow, nor what my farming neighbors call a forehanded one. Indeed, those rumors about my behindhandedness are so far correct, that I have an odd sauntering way with me sometimes of going about with my hands behind my back. As for my belonging to the rear-guard in general, certain it is, I bring up the rear of my chimney--which, by the way, is this moment before me--and that, too, both in fancy and fact.

60|$|But however we divide poetry, {{the office}} of {{imagination}} is to disengage what is essential from the crowd of accessories which is apt to confuse the vision of ordinary minds. For our perceptions of things are gregarious, and are wont to huddle together and jostle one another. It is only {{those who have been}} long trained to shepherd their thoughts that can at once single out each member of the flock by something peculiar to itself. That the power of abstraction {{has something to do with}} the imagination is clear, I think, from the fact that everybody is a dramatic poet (so far as the conception of character goes) in his sleep. His acquaintances walk and talk before him on the stage of dream precisely as in life. When he wakes, his genius has flown away with his sleep. It was indeed nothing more than that his mind was not distracted by the multiplicity of details which the senses force upon it by day. He thinks of Smith, and it is no longer a mere name on a doorplate or in a directory; but Smith himself is there, with those marvellous commonplaces of his which, could you only hit them off when you were awake, you would have created Justice Shallow. Nay, is not there, too, that offensively supercilious creak of the boots with which he enforced his remarks on the war in Europe, when he last caught you at the corner of the street and decanted into your ears the stale <b>settlings</b> of a week of newspapers? Now, did not Shakespeare tell us that the imagination bodies forth? It is indeed the verbum caro factum--the word made flesh and blood.|$|E

6000|$|Then {{there is}} Carlyle. Carlyle professed to think ill {{enough of the}} eighteenth century--poor {{bankrupt}} century, and so forth,--but so little did he find it common, flat, or uninteresting, that he could never tear himself away from it. Can it be pretended that he, too, 'missed the true point of view'? Every reader of the History of Frederick remembers the Jenkins's-Ear-Question, and how 'half the World lay hidden in embryo under it. Colonial-Empire, whose is it to be? Shall half the world be England's, for industrial purposes; which is innocent, laudable, conformable to the Multiplication Table, at least, and other plain laws? Shall there be a Yankee Nation, shall there not be; shall the New World be of Spanish type, shall it be of English? Issues which we may call immense.' This, the possession of the new world, was 'England's one Cause of War during the century we are now upon (Bk. xii. ch. xii.) It is 'the soul of all these Controversies and the one meaning they have' (xvi. xiv.) When the war was over, and the peace made at Hubertsburgh, Carlyle apprehended as clearly as words can express, what the issue of it was for England and the English race. England, he says, is to have America and the dominion of the seas,--considerable facts both,--'and {{in the rear of}} these, the new Country is to get into such merchandisings, colonisings, foreign <b>settlings,</b> gold nuggetings, as lay beyond the drunkenest dreams of Jenkins (supposing Jenkins addicted to liquor)--and in fact to enter on a universal uproar of Machineries, Eldorados, [...] "Unexampled Prosperities," [...] which make a great noise for themselves in the days now come,' with much more to the same effect (xx. xiii.) Allowance made for the dialect, we do not see how the pith and root of the matter, the connection between the transactions of the eighteenth century and the industrial and colonial expansion that followed them, could be more firmly or more accurately seized.|$|E

PARTICLES WERE COLLECTED AT SEVERAL SITES OVER 24 -HOUR PERIODS USING 0. 03 m 2 (COLLECTING SURFACE) AND 0. 5 m 2 FREE-DRIFTING SEDIMENT TRAPS AT 50 AND 150 m. TOTAL MASS FLUX VARIED WIDLEY (80 - 1500 mg/m 2 /d), AS DID CARBON FLUX (16 - 300 mgC/m 2 /d). SMALL CYLINDERS CONSISTENTLY OVER SAMPLED WITH RESPECT TO BIG CYLINDERS, REGARDLEES OF DEPTH OF DRIFTER DESIGN. ALSO, 6 -MONTH TIME-SERIES WERE OBTAINED WITH A MOORED, 0. 125 m 2 TRAP AT TWO SITES. IN THE ANTICOSTI GYRE, TIME-SERIES FLUXES WERE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OBTAINED FROM THE LARGE DRIFTING TRAP (MEANS: 480 mg DRY wt/m 2 /d; 39 mgC/m 2 /d), AND WITH INDEPENDENTLY MEASURED SEDIMENT ACCUMULATION RATES. NUMERIC FLUXES OF PHYTOPLANKTON CELLS WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND IN MODERATELY PRODUCTIVE OCEAN MARGINS DURING THE APRIL 1994 BLOOM, BUT OTHERWISE RESEMBLED THOSE FROM OLIGOTROPHIC REGIMES. FECAL PELLET NUMERIC FLUXES, IN CONTRAST, WERE ALWAYS HIGH, SIMILAR TO OTHER CONTINENTAL MARGINS. THE COMPOSITION OF THE MATERIAL COLLECTED BY THE SMALL AND LARGE TRAPS IS A GOOD INDICATOR OF THE CHANGING TROPHIC REGIME IN THE WATER COLUMN. RELATIVE NUMERIC ABUNDANCES SUGGEST THREE DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT PERIODS. A "BLOOM" PERIOD (REPRESENTED BY APRIL 1994, BUT INCLUDING A WEAKER LATE-FALL BLOOM OVER A SHELF VALLEY), WHEN A VARIETY OF CENTRIC AND PENNATE DIATOM CELLS MADE UP 70 - 95 % OF THE PARTICLE NUMBERS; A TRANSITIONAL OR "POST-BLOOM" PERIOD (JUNE 1994), WHEN PHYTOPLANKTON WERE LESS ABUNDANT, PENNATE FORMS WERE SCARCE AND A SINGLE SPECIES DOMINATED THE CENTRIC DIATOMS; AN A "NON-BLOOM" PERIOD (MAY TO DEC., 1993) WHEN FECAL PELLETS AND MICROZOOPLANKTON ACCOUNTED FOR GREATER NUMBERS THAN THE PHYTOPLANKTON CELLS, INCLUIDING ABUNDANT DINOFLAGELLATES. THE TIME-SERIES ANTICOSTI GYRE TRAP SHOWED CONTINUED LARGE-PARTICLE <b>SETTLING</b> THROUGHOUT THE WINTER WITH TOTAL MASS AND CARBON FLUXES SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND IN THE ICE-FREE SEASON. THE MOST FREQUENT FECAL PELLETS WERE 50 - 109 um DIAMETER COMPACT AND LOOSE RODS, PRODUCED BY THE DOMINANT CALANOID COPEPODS. LARGE MACROZOOPLANKTON FECAL PELLETS OCURRED ONLY SPORADICALLY. MANY PELLETS < 49 um WERE COLLECTED IN DECEMBER 1993, PROBABLY PRODUCED BY Microcalanus, WICH WAS UNUSUALLY MULTIPLE ORIGINS. THE PARTICULARE ORGANIC CARBON (POC) AND THE C CONTRIBUTION OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PARTICLES HAVE BEEN ANALYZED FOR FREE. DRIFTING SEDIMENT TRAPS. TWO TRAP MODELS ONLY WERE USED IN 1993 - 1994 : SMALL TRAPS AT 50 m AN AND LARGER TRAPS AT 50 AND 150 m. ABSOLUTE MEAN FLUXES OF POC (42 - 149 mg C m- 2 d- 1 ON LARGE AND SMALL TRAPS RESPECTIVELY), OF C ATTRIBUTED TO FECAL PELLETS (6 - 60 mg C m 2 d- 1) AND OF C ATTRIBUTED TO PHYTOPLANKTON (3. 2 - 42. 9 MG C m- 2 d- 1) WERE ALL IN THE SAME RANGE AS THOSE ENCOUNTERED IN REGIONS OF MODERATE PRODUCTIVITY. FECAL PELLETS WERE THE MAJOR COMPONENT OF T HIS FLUX WITH AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION OF MICROZOOPLANKTON, PARTICULARLY DURING THE SUMMER OF 1994, THE PHYTOPLANKTON CONTRIBUTION TO POC FLUX WAS LIGHTLY SMALLER THAN THE FECAL PELLETS CONTRIBUTION. THE IDENTIFICATION OF ALGAL GROUPS THAT ARE PART OF THIS FLUX LED TO RECOGNITION OF THE THREE TROPHIC REGIMES ALREADY IDENTIFIED FROM WATER COLUMN STUDIES AND FROM THE NUMERIC FLUXES IN THIS STUDY: (1) A "BLOMM" PERIOD, WHEN THE DIATOMS WERE DOMINANT DURING SPRING, (2) "NON-BLOMM" PERIOD, A LONGER INTERVAL, WICH WAS DOMINATED BY DINOFLAGELLATES AND (3) A TRANSITION "POST-BLOOM" PERIOD DURING THE SUMMER.
