However, {{he wrote that}} despite the story being [...] "a good one", he is [...] "a little tired of discovering Harry {{at home with his}} horrible aunt and uncle", the formulaic beginning of all seven books. King has also joked that [...] "Rowling's never met an adverb she did not like!" [...] He does however predict that Harry Potter [...] "will indeed stand time's test and wind up on a shelf where only the best are kept; I think Harry will take his place with Alice, Huck, Frodo, and Dorothy and this is one series not just for the decade, but for the ages". Sameer Rahim of The Daily Telegraph disagreed, saying [...] "It depresses me to see 16 and 17 year-olds reading the series when they could be reading the great novels of childhood such as Oliver Twist or A House for Mr Biswas. What that <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> adults who are fanatical fans I’m not sure – but I suspect in years to come people will make a link between our plump, comfortable, infantilising society and the popularity of Potter." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{screenplay}} by Paul Verhoeven and Gerard Soeteman {{was turned into}} a thriller novel by Dutch writer Laurens Abbink Spaink. The book was published in September 2006 by Uitgeverij Podium and contains photos and an afterword by Verhoeven and Soeteman. Spaink <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> book: [...] "'Black Book' is a literary thriller. Its form is in between the typical American novelization, only describing what the camera sees, and a literary novel. The novelization adds something to the film. It gave Rachel Stein a past, memories and a house. In the film she did not have a personal space." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another viewer offered, [...] “I {{always thought}} {{painting}} {{was supposed to}} be about hopes, dreams, the imagination. [...] Instead, you seem to say it’s political statement at every brushstroke. [...] Your tendentious opinions betray a lack of understanding of the artist and a blindness to the paintings themselves. [...] Every painting is, according to you, an evil, cunning, greedy “Anglo-American.” Shame on you for choosing to make a statement (a very limited statement) about your “political correctness” instead of really looking at the art for what it <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> appeal of the West to our collective imagination. [...] Art is bigger than everyday logic.” (Signed VC, Alexandria, VA) ...|$|E

Jeremy Ben-Ami, President of the liberal lobby group J Street, said: [...] "The notion that Chuck Hagel is anti-Israel is ludicrous. The notion that he is anti-Semitic is slanderous." [...] Harvard University Professor Stephen Walt, co-author of a 2007 book critical of the Israeli lobby wrote in Foreign Policy that [...] "The real meaning of the Hagel affair is what it <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> climate inside Washington.

2500|$|This {{coincided with}} a [...] {{determined}} effort by the British Raj to discredit the movement {{with the assistance of}} mullahs and ulema allied with the British. The British Governor, Cunningham, instructed the big khans to meet each mullah on individual basis and tell him to serve the 'cause of Islam' for which he would be duly paid. The Mullahs were told that in case of good progress they would also be considered for government pension. A Cunningham policy note of 23 September 1942 reads: 'Continuously preach the danger to Muslims of connivance with the revolutionary Hindu body. Most tribesmen seem to respond to this', while in another paper he <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> period 1939–43: 'Our propaganda {{since the beginning of the}} war had been most successful.

2500|$|Certain critics, such as Jussi Lahtonen of the Finnish indie rock {{magazine}} Sue, {{have argued}} that separating Christian from non-Christian black metal artists [...] "feels rather pointless". However, early groups such as Horde and Antestor refused to call their music [...] "black metal" [...] because they felt that the style was strongly associated with Satanism. Horde called its music [...] "holy unblack metal", and Antestor preferred to call their music [...] "sorrow metal" [...] instead. Stefan Rydehed, director of the metal documentary Light in Darkness – Nemesis Divina <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> unblack metal musicians based on his interviews: [...] "The Christian black metal musicians see themselves {{as a part of}} the black metal community but they have a hard time to be accepted.

2500|$|Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan {{commented on}} the {{violence}} depicted in the film: [...] "The Coen brothers dropped the mask.

[...] However, Turan explained that [...] "no one should see No Country for Old Men underestimating the intensity of its violence. But it's also clear that the Coen brothers and McCarthy {{are not interested in}} violence for its own sake, but for what it <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world we live in ... As the film begins, a confident deputy says I got it under control, and in moments he is dead. He didn't have anywhere near the mastery he imagined.

2500|$|The {{allied forces}} had {{at first glance}} some {{advantages}} over the Chilean forces. Their population and armies doubled the Chileans in numbers and the Peruvian port of Callao, with its powerful artillery, was both impregnable for the Chilean navy {{as well as a}} secure haven for the Peruvian navy. In Callao, an English company offered the service of a floating dock for ships up to 3000 t, and the Peruvian government used it to repair their ships {{at the outset of the}} war. These were probably the reasons why the international press announced the secure defeat of Chile at the beginning of the war. Moreover, the ambivalent Argentine position and the never ending Mapuche conflict overshadowed the Chilean perspective. J. Basadre <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> public opinion in Peru and Bolivia: [...] "They ignored the real power of Chile and the horrors of war, and simple minded people believed that the allied would win the war because they together were bigger than Chile".|$|E
2500|$|The {{visual effects}} and {{backgrounds}} {{for the film}} were created digitally using Cintiq tablet displays. Marlon West, one of Disney's veteran animation visual effects supervisors, <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> production; [...] "Those guys had this bright idea to bring back hand-drawn animation, but everything had to be started again from the ground up. One {{of the first things}} we did was focus on producing shorts, to help us re-introduce the 2D pipeline. I worked as vfx supervisor on the Goofy short, How to Hook Up Your Home Theater. It was a real plus for the effects department, so we went paperless for The Princess and the Frog." [...] The backgrounds were painted digitally using Adobe Photoshop, and many of the architectural elements were based upon 3D models built in Autodesk Maya. Much of the clean-up animation, digital ink-and-paint, and compositing were outsourced to third-party companies in Orlando, Florida (Premise Entertainment), Toronto, Ontario, Canada (Yowza Digital Animation), and Brooklin, São Paulo, Brazil (HGN Produções) ...|$|E
2500|$|The oldest {{evidence}} {{of breast cancer}} was discovered in Egypt in 2015 and {{dates back to the}} Sixth Dynasty. The study of a woman's remains from the necropolis of Qubbet el-Hawa showed the typical destructive damage due to metastatic spread. The Edwin Smith Papyrus describes 8 cases of tumors or ulcers of the breast that were treated by cauterization. The writing <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> disease, [...] "There is no treatment." [...] For centuries, physicians described similar cases in their practices, with the same conclusion. [...] Ancient medicine, {{from the time of the}} Greeks through the 17th century, was based on humoralism, and thus believed that breast cancer was generally caused by imbalances in the fundamental fluids that controlled the body, especially an excess of black bile. [...] Alternatively, patients often saw it as divine punishment. [...] In the 18th century, a wide variety of medical explanations were proposed, including a lack of sexual activity, too much sexual activity, physical injuries to the breast, curdled breast milk, and various forms of lymphatic blockages, either internal or due to restrictive clothing. [...] In the 19th century, the Scottish surgeon John Rodman said that fear of cancer caused cancer, and that this anxiety, learned by example from the mother, accounted for breast cancer's tendency to run in families.|$|E

2500|$|The painterly {{legacy of}} 20th-century {{painting}} {{is a long}} and intertwined mainstream of influences and complex interrelationships. The use of large opened fields of expressive color applied in generous painterly portions, accompanied by loose drawing (vague linear spots and/or figurative outline) can first {{be seen in the}} early 20th-century works of both Henri Matisse and Joan Miró. Matisse and Miró as well as Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky and Piet Mondrian directly influenced the Abstract Expressionists, the Color Field painters of Post-Painterly Abstraction and the Lyrical Abstractionists. Late 19th-century Americans like Augustus Vincent Tack and Albert Pinkham Ryder along with early American Modernists like Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley Stuart Davis, Arthur Dove and Milton Avery's landscapes also provided important precedents and were influences on the Abstract Expressionists, the Color Field painters and the Lyrical Abstractionists. Henri Matisse paintings French Window at Collioure, and View of Notre Dame both from 1914 exerted tremendous influence on American Color Field painters in general (including Robert Motherwell's Open Series) and on Richard Diebenkorn's Ocean Park paintings specifically. According to art historian Jane Livingston, Diebenkorn saw both Matisse paintings in an exhibition in Los Angeles in 1966 and they had an enormous impact on him and his work.

2500|$|In September 2011, Ahern said he {{believed}} {{that he would have}} [...] "done all right" [...] in the presidential election but for the decline in the popularity of Fianna Fáil. Ahern confirmed he considered running in the election. [...] "I still would have done all right. I mean they have done some figures and I would probably sit in around 30 per cent, which you haven’t a hope with as the party is on 20 per cent." [...] He added that [...] "the party popularity is the thing that snookers it, because if your party isn’t winnable..." [...] Mr Ahern said: [...] "If there was no downturn and if it wasn’t all the hassle of the tribunals and everything else, then you could have had a good run at it." [...] He predicted that [...] "nobody is going to win it outright – like Mary McAleese had it won on the first count". Asked about a possible future candidacy in the following presidential election, he said: [...] "Normally what happens in this country, if a president does a good job they stay on, so that’s 14 years, so that ends any chance that I’ll have." [...] He also rejected suggestions that the Mahon tribunal would reject the evidence he gave on his personal finances. [...] "The only thing that is important to me is the central allegations. And what the tribunal <b>says</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> other trash is irrelevant." [...] Michael Martin said the former taoiseach was [...] "out of touch with reality" [...] if {{he believed}} he could have won the presidency for Fianna Fáil. Martin also said expenses paid to Mr Ahern in his capacity as a former taoiseach were too high and should be reduced. He was commenting on reports that Mr Ahern had claimed €265,000 for [...] "secretarial services" [...] and €7,500 on mobile phone bills since he stepped down in May 2008. Under the current expenses regime, a former taoiseach may employ two secretarial assistants for up to five years after leaving office and one indefinitely after that.|$|E
