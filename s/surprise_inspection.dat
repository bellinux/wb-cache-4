The NRC officials tell Mr. Burns that Homer's job requires college training in nuclear physics, and that he must go back to college to keep his job.

The city of New York may institute a similar policy; however, inspections would be difficult in New York City because the buses do not all leave the city from the same location.|$|R

2500|$|According to the U.S. Consumers Union, Earth Island and U.S. dolphin safe labels {{provide no}} {{guarantee}} that dolphins are not harmed during the fishing process because verification is neither universal nor independent. Still, tuna fishing boats and canneries operating under any of the various U.S. labeling standards are subject to <b>surprise</b> <b>inspection</b> and observation. [...] For US import, companies face strict charges of fraud for any violation of the label standards, while Earth Island Institute (EII), an independent environmental organization, verifies the standards are met by more than 700 tuna companies outside the U.S through inspections of canneries, storage units, and audits of fishing logs. [...] It {{should be noted that}} Earth Island Institute receives donations from the companies it verifies; and EII has never had an external scientific audit of its labeling program, a best practice for eco-labels.

2500|$|The final holdout was Captain Jürgen Wattenberg, who was {{captured}} {{over a month}} after the escape. Instead of heading south, Wattenberg and two of his subordinates, Walter Kozur and Johann Kremer, made shelter out of a cave in the mountains north of Phoenix. From there they explored the area and even dared to venture into the city. According to author Ronald H. Bailey, Kremler [...] "pulled off the most bizarre caper of the entire escape." [...] Every few days he would make contact with one of the German workers sent outside of the camp's perimeter and exchange places with him. The exchanged prisoner would spend the night in the cave with Captain Wattenberg while Kremer slipped back into camp. Inside, Kremer would gather food and information. To deliver the food he would either join a work detail and escape again or send it out with another worker. This continued for some time until January 22, when a <b>surprise</b> <b>inspection</b> revealed Kremer's presence in camp. Kremer must have given his captors information because on the following night Kozur {{was captured}} by three soldiers at the abandoned car used to hide the provisions. Four days later, on January 27, 1945, Wattenberg walked to Phoenix and was arrested by the police.|$|E

50|$|A <b>surprise</b> <b>inspection</b> {{tends to}} have {{different}} results than an announced inspection. Leaders wanting to know how others in their organization perform can drop in without warning, to see directly what happens. If an inspection is made known in advance, it can give {{people a chance to}} cover up or to fix mistakes. This could lead to distorted and inaccurate findings. A <b>surprise</b> <b>inspection,</b> therefore, gives inspectors a better picture of the typical state of the inspected object or process than an announced inspection. It also enhances external confidence in the inspection process. See section 4.12 of the Crear report.|$|E
