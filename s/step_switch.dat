50|$|In 1961 the {{locomotive}} was fitted with new cogwheels in the Tschanz drives. But onOctober 7th 1964 a driver reported a flashover at the <b>step</b> <b>switch,</b> {{and as a}} result of this {{the locomotive}} was towed to the Zürich repair workshop. Unfortunately the workshop was busy because of the additional services it had to provide for the 1964 Swiss National Exhibition (Expo 64), and the locomotive was stored for the time being. The SBB general management had decided to withdraw all of the veteran locomotives after Expo 64, so the Ae 4/8 was promptly scrapped.|$|E

50|$|The 18-step {{flat track}} BBC <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> was {{mounted on the}} transformer. It was driven by a battery {{supplied}} direct-current motor. Initially the <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> was controlled by a crank handle, later by a control wheel. It was possible to operate the <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> by hand, but only by someone actually at the switch inside the centre locomotive body.|$|R

50|$|The <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> {{transmitted}} the {{traction current}} to the motors which were connected in series circuit. The flat track <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> was mounted to the transformer. It consisted of 18 steps with voltages between 230 V and 1300 V. For both motor groups a reverse switch was mounted.|$|R
50|$|The two {{transformers}} were - unusual at the SBB - air ventilated. The {{design was}} the same as the Be 5/7 of the BLS. The switches were fixed to the transformers. The connection to the respective voltage steps was executed with contact camshafts. The switching process was started with special sparkle extinguishing camshafts. The <b>step</b> <b>switch</b> used compressed air and had 12 steps. Since the two switches were operated alternatively, this meant that 23 steps were required which meant that the switching time was very slow. To operate the step switches, the locomotive driver had to turn a vertical crank handle once for each step. It was possible to shut off power by running down both step switches with a special handle.|$|E
5000|$|Operational {{problems}} nevertheless {{arose from}} lack of infrastructure investment which meant that {{right up to the}} end most of the Klagenfurt tram system operated on a single track network. In 1944 irreparable bomb damage at the Kreuzbergl caused the a section of tramline to be replaced with a trolleybus service. From 1948 the tram routes were also being operated by diesel buses, and on 6 May 1954 the city council passed a resolution to abandon the tram system. The line to the lakeshore was closed the same year. There followed a further period of uncertainty before the stretch to Annabichl was also closed, in 1961. The step by <b>step</b> <b>switch</b> to buses was completed on 16 April 1963 when the one and a half kilometer long tram service connecting the station to [...] "Holy Ghost Square" [...] (Heiligengeist Platz) was withdrawn. 16 April 1963 also marked the ending of trolleybus services in the city.|$|E
50|$|Two {{diamond-shaped}} pantographs - controllable with a valve in each cab - {{lead the}} current from the catenary {{to the two}} electrical cutting knives {{on the roof of}} the locomotive body. These cutting knives could be controlled manually from the engine room. From these cutting knives, the current was transferred to the oil-cooled transformer over a lightning protection inductor and the oil-propelled main switch. The transformer was located in the center of the locomotive body. On the high voltage side, the transformer was switchable for either 15,000 V or 7500 V. This arrangement was necessary since the SBB decided to supply the Gotthard railway line at start only with 7500 V because the main operation was still steam. The SBB was considering that the carbon black on the insulators of the catenary could lead to shortcuts when very high voltage was used. The low-voltage side of the transformer was bifid and equipped with 11 taps. The two camshaft switches were mounted in longitudinal direction on both sides of the transformer. It was possible - as at the Be 3/5 12201 - to select 23 steps. For handling the step switches, the locomotive driver had to turn a vertical crank handle once for each step. It was possible to shut off power by running down both step switches with a special handle. If one <b>step</b> <b>switch</b> failed it could be separated. With the remaining one it was possible to continue the trip with the 12 steps of the other one. The four pneumatic controlled reverse switches were placed on the motors. They were connected in parallel.|$|E
50|$|The <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> {{transmitted}} the {{traction current}} to the motors, which were connected in series circuit. The flat track <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> was {{mounted on the}} transformer and consisted of 18 steps providing voltages between 237V and 1350V. To suppress sparks during switching, spark switches were used. The switch was operated by a 36V motor powered by a battery. To operate the <b>step</b> <b>switches</b> the locomotive driver had to turn a vertical crank handle, later changed to a horizontal controller. These controllers drove two polarized relays, which switched up until the requested step was reached.|$|R

40|$|Introduction This {{contribution}} is {{for students of}} the complex and the simple, specially for those at the convergence of the two. We attempt here to isolate the simple common thread running through a complex landscape. The lansdcape emcompasses the processes for which brains are wonderfully and mysteriously unique, and the thread is {{the conviction that the}} functional building blocks must be fully local nonlinear operations. Intuition to isolate the simple arise from common sense dictating that brains do not exist as a blueprint in the genetic code, but that they have to self-organize. Familiarity with nonlinearities taught us that self-organization of a complex, smart, "whole" may arise from simple, stupid, local but nonlinear rules. Without calling for complicated examples, just think of sorting numbered pieces using local rules. A rule which tells pieces"in the next time <b>step,</b> <b>switch</b> positions with your left neighbor if its number is smaller than yours, otherwise stay put" wi...|$|E
40|$|Reactive power {{compensation}} devices are widely used: thyristor-control reactors (TCR) and thyristor-switched capacitors (TSC). The TCR disadvantages are discussed. The TSC disadvantages are: influence of higher harmonics on nonsinusoidal voltage power system, {{the inability to}} ensure the smooth regulation. The proposed reactive power compensator consists of series with active filter and capacitors with <b>step</b> <b>switch.</b> Reactive power compensator’s control system is proposed. Hysteretic control of the inverter with current feedback is applied. DC-voltage regulator provides balance of active power. The control system allows overcompensation or undercompensation of reactive power modes. Reactive power distribution regulator performs the redistribution of power between switching capacitors and active filter. Minimization condition of this regulator is active filter’s power. Adjustment properties of reactive power compensator are analyzed. The choice of relations between the capacitors TSC steps to minimize the installed capacity of the active filter {{and the number of}} stages in TSC is considered. The approach that makes possible to «isolate» capacitors from harmonic currents and provide smooth control of reactive power is propose...|$|E

50|$|In a uniselector, the <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> <b>steps</b> only on one axis, {{although}} there are often several sets of contacts in parallel. In other types, such as the Strowger switch, mechanical switching occurs on two directions, across a grid of contacts. The Strowger switch was invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1888.|$|R

Before Nixie tubes became prominent, most numeric displays were electromechanical, using stepping mechanisms to display digits either directly {{by use of}} cylinders bearing printed numerals attached to their rotors, or indirectly by wiring the outputs of <b>stepping</b> <b>switches</b> to indicator bulbs. Later, a few vintage clocks even used a form of <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> to drive Nixie tubes.|$|R

50|$|In {{electrical}} controls, a <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> or <b>stepping</b> relay, {{also known}} as a uniselector, is an electromechanical device that switches an input signal path to one of several possible output paths, directed by a train of electrical pulses.|$|R
25|$|In {{electrical}} controls, a <b>stepping</b> <b>switch,</b> {{also known}} as a stepping relay, is an electromechanical device which allows an input connection to be connected to {{one of a number of}} possible output connections, under the control of a series of electrical pulses. The major use for these devices was in early automatic telephone exchanges to route telephone calls. It can step on one axis (called a uniselector), or on two axes (a Strowger switch). As the first automated telephone switch using electromagnets and hat pins, <b>stepping</b> <b>switches</b> were invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1888. Strowger filed his patent application on March 12, 1889, and it was issued on March 10, 1891.|$|R
2500|$|On March 10, 1891, Almon Brown Strowger, an {{undertaker}} in Kansas City, Missouri, patented the <b>stepping</b> <b>switch,</b> {{a device}} {{which led to}} the automation of telephone circuit switching. While there were many extensions and adaptations of this initial patent, the one best known consists of 10 levels or banks, each having 10 contacts arranged in a semicircle. When used with a rotary telephone dial, each pair of digits caused the shaft of the central contact [...] "hand" [...] of the <b>stepping</b> <b>switch</b> to first <b>step</b> (ratchet) up one level for each pulse in the first digit and then to swing horizontally in a contact row with one small rotation for each pulse in the next digit.|$|R

50|$|<b>Stepping</b> <b>switches</b> {{were quite}} noisy in {{operation}} (especially when self-stepping), because their mechanisms accelerated and stopped quickly to minimize operating time. One could compare their sound {{to that of}} some snap-action mechanisms. Nevertheless, they were engineered for long life, given periodic maintenance; they were quite reliable.|$|R
50|$|Typical <b>stepping</b> <b>switches</b> have {{contacts}} {{directly operated}} by the stepping magnet's armature; these contacts can serve to make the magnet cycle ("self-step") and advance the wipers as long as power is applied. The external control circuits remove power when the wipers reach the desired position; {{that could be the}} home position.|$|R
