The fact that the hidden periodicities, referred to as Higher Order Cyclostationary Statistics (HOCS), are compressible in the Fourier domain motivates the use of compressive sensing (CS) as an efficient acquisition protocol for capturing such signals. In this work, we consider the task of performing AMR when CS is used to acquire the communication signal. We develop a theoretical framework for estimating HOCS using the low-rate nonuniform sampling protocol from CS and validate our theory using simulated data.

40|$|A new spectroscopic {{parameter}} {{is used in}} {{this paper}} for on-line arc-welding quality monitoring. Plasma spectroscopy applied to welding diagnostics has typically relied on the estimation of the plasma electronic temperature, {{as there is a}} known correlation between this parameter {{and the quality of the}} seams.

For an efficient on-line welding monitoring system, it is essential to prevent the appearance of false alarms, as well as to detect all the possible defects. In this regard, we propose the use of the root mean <b>square</b> <b>signal</b> of the welding plasma spectra, as this parameter will be proven to exhibit a good correlation with the quality of the resulting seams.

30|$|To provide {{quantitative}} {{filter performance}} results, {{the following section}} presents a brief case study that examines {{the influence of the}} Hampel filter tuning parameter t on the performance of both the standard Hampel filter and the recursive Hampel filter. Since the primary question of interest is the influence of the tuning parameter t, this example considers a fixed window half-width parameter (specifically, K= 5, yielding an 11 -point moving window filter) and examines filter performance over a range of t values. The basis for these performance comparisons is a simulated data example described in Section 5.1 : the advantage of considering a simulation-based example is that we can be explicit about the signal components we wish to recover and can therefore quantify signal recovery performance. More specifically, this example considers two possible signal recovery problems described in detail in Section 5.1 and characterizes performance in terms of two metrics: the root mean <b>square</b> <b>signal</b> recovery error (RMSE) and the mean absolute signal recovery error (MAE).|$|E
