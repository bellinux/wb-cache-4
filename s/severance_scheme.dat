The {{history of the}} battle between Anwar Khan and his brother Hussain Khan (Bara Bhuiyans of Baniachang) with the Mughal army {{in the first decade}} of the seventeenth century is found in the Baharistan-i-Gayebi. Zamindars of Banyachung was renowned for their generosity, but the last zamindar was more than generous; he was well known for his gullibility and his aged but adept and calculating servants such as dewans and chaudharies swindled him left, right and centre. By the time of the retirement, dewans and chauddharies working for Banyachung zamindar ended up holding more lands than the zamindar himself. This was achieved through a <b>severance</b> <b>scheme</b> conjured up by a shrewd dewan; this scheme made the zamindar honour-bound to grant land (taluque) to his servants on retirement and there were two categories of taluque: (i) Khalisa and (ii) Mujrahi, aka Mujrai. The first category of taluque, i.e. Khalisa, was reserved for the male servants and the second category of taluque, i.e. Mujrai, was reserved for zamindar’s courtesans. This scheme ruined the zamindary of Baniyachung within a very short span of time and created numerous Khalisadar and Mujraidar in the region, who nowadays style themselves as chowdhury in Sylhet region.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overview of severance pay regulation in the South-Eastern Europe (SEE) countries, thereby complementing empirical analysis of severance pay programs with findings on the SEE countries. We found that in general <b>severance</b> pay <b>schemes</b> are very similar among the SEE countries, but vary significantly in their modalities. The results of the empirical analysis show that generous severance pay is negatively associated with GDP per capita, labor productivity and employment. These results reinforce previous findings on this topic and lead to the conclusion that traditional <b>severance</b> pay <b>schemes</b> need to be reformed.

We found that in general <b>severance</b> pay <b>schemes</b> are very similar among the SEE countries, but vary significantly in their modalities. Severance pay programmes are rather generous, especially when compared to more developed OECD and EU- 15 countries. Moreover, several countries in the region complement already generous severance pay with mild legislation on minimum tenure required to be eligible for benefit and rather long notice periods before dismissal.

In Egypt, only voluntary programs are feasible because legal limitations preclude layoffs and strong organized labor groups oppose any weakening of job security protections. A common problem with voluntary severance programs, however, is {{that they tend to}} overpay workers relative to the welfare losses they expe-rience from displacement. This article estimates the losses that public sector workers would incur if they were displaced from their jobs and simulates several voluntary <b>severance</b> <b>schemes</b> to deter-mine how well the schemes match compensation payments to these estimated losses. It provides a fairly strong argument for looking at the structure of opportunity costs and wage profiles when designing severance programs. It shows that significant overpay-ment can be avoided by matching compensation payments to the expected losses of workers. It also provides a method for estimating these losses from standard labor force surveys that are available in most countries.

40|$|The paper aims {{to analyze}} the {{determinants}} of the individual choice of con- tributing to pension funds, particularly by focusing on individual preferences towards the annuitization of the accumulated pension capital. The analysis is performed {{in the light of}} the latest reform of social security in Italy, convert- ing the <b>severance</b> pay <b>scheme</b> (the so-called TFR) into a fully funded scheme of pension funds. The model describes the behavior of a representative agent belonging to a representative generation in steady state, in a partial equilibrium setting with mortality risk as well as uncertainty on wages and financial market returns. Investing in riskier but potentially more rewarding pension funds, paying out annuities from retirement onwards, turns out to be slightly welfare improving with respect to contributing to a <b>severance</b> pay <b>scheme</b> eventually paying out a lump-sum amount. Nonetheless, the welfare-based value of insurance provided by private annuities from pension funds is relatively low, mainly due to a) the pre-existence of (sizeable) public annuities, and b) constraints imposed by annuitization on both saving and consumption behavior after retirement. These findings provide further insights into the Òannuity puzzleÓ issue. Social Security Reforms; Uncertainty; Fully Funded Pension Schemes. ...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{looks at}} whether {{the gap between}} the amount of on-the-job {{training}} (OJT hereafter) employers provide to permanent workers (those holding an open-ended/indefinite contract) and temporary workers (those holding a fixed-term contract) is larger in labor markets with highly discontinuous <b>severance</b> pay <b>schemes</b> than in less segmented ones. One plausible mechanism leading to this differential in training relies on the larger turnover rate experienced by temporary workers because of the much less stringent employment protection legislation (EPL henceforth; in particular mandated severance pay) they enjoy relative to permanent workers. Whenever wage rigidity prevents firms neutralizing severance payments (i.e., a transfer from employers to workers), this gap in EPL rules makes firms more prone to use temporary contracts in sequence and less so to convert these contracts into permanent contracts. As a result of the greater job churn of temporary workers, employers do not find it profitable to invest in their OJT. Conversely, the higher job stability implied by the much higher EPL enjoyed by permanent workers makes firms more eager to invest in their training.|$|R

40|$|This report {{examines}} unemployment protection {{with emphasis}} on three groups of countries: 1) OECD, 2) Central-East Europe and the Former Soviet Union; and 3) East and South Asia. Section 1 notes the presence of various public social protection programs including pensions, work injury insurance, health insurance, and unemployment benefits. Section 2 describes the measurement of unemployment in these countries and provides details of their unemployment protection programs including unemployment insurance, unemployment assistance, and <b>severance</b> pay <b>schemes.</b> Section 3 explores the costs of providing unemployment protection. It decomposes the cost of unemployment protection into three components: 1) the unemployment rate; 2) the share of weeks of unemployment that are compensated; and 3) the replacement rate (average benefits {{as a proportion of}} average wages). Cross country evidence regarding these components of costs is briefly reviewed. Comments on the potential costs of unemployment insurance for Asian economies are offered. Section 4 examines alternatives to unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance for addressing the loss of earnings and increase in poverty associated with unemployment. The four alternatives are severance pay, temporary public employment, social investment funds, and community loan funds. Some observations are made on the comparative strengths and weaknesses of these alternatives.

40|$|This paper {{sheds light}} on the current state and the likely future {{development}} of Korea’s evolving pension system by analyzing it from a comparative perspective. It shows that, because of its many institutional layers, the Korean pension system could evolve into one of several different types of pension regimes: if the National Pension Scheme (NPS) were {{to continue to be}} dominant and occupational pensions continued to be marginal, a classic Bismarckian system would emerge; if the NPS were to be significantly reduced and occupational pensions were to be significantly expanded, a Bismarckian-light system would be the outcome; if other changes were to occur—such as the conversion of the basic pension into a universal, poverty-preventing pension and the partial replacement of the NPS by a mandatory personal or occupational-pension scheme—a mixed regime would emerge. The paper argues that the emergence and consolidation of a Bismarckian-style, single-pillar system is more likely than the shift to one of the variants of the multi-pillar system, such as the Bismarckian-light and the mixed regime type. Since there are many sources of path dependence that reinforce the Bismarckian path of development, a shift to a different pension regime is very difficult. For example, large accumulated entitlements and the strong redistributive role of the NPS make it difficult to reduce the public, earnings-related pension program, and significant accumulated entitlements and the important role of the <b>severance</b> pay <b>scheme</b> in company financing also make it difficult to expand occupational pensions. welfare state, pension systems, path dependence, institutional change, Korea...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades Italy {{implemented}} a number of reforms of the public pay-as-you-go (PAYG) scheme that curtailed future pensions. Governments therefore felt the need {{to increase the number of}} workers contributing to fully funded (FF) schemes to offset the expected fall in public pensions. In the private sector an existing saving fund, the <b>severance</b> pay <b>scheme</b> (Trattamento di fine rapporto or TFR) was used to expand the anaemic existing FF pillar. The macroeconomic content of the reform seems fragile since the economy’s amount of precautionary saving has not changed. The question is why a bolder reform aiming at creating an additional new old-age saving scheme has not been attempted by the Italian Government. The answer presumably has to do with troubles surrounding the macroeconomics of pension reforms, in particular the difficulties of setting up a FF scheme from scratch or by diverting resources from an existing PAYG program. Not surprisingly, no reform was attempted in the public sector where the TFR works on a PAYG basis. An ancillary argument to defend the reform relies on presumed higher returns from private pension funds (PFs) compared to the old TFR. In this light, the paper examines the non-exiting financial performance of the PFs. The instability of financial markets, even before the current crises, and the fondness of workers for the old TFR are finally used to explain the low popularity of the reform. All in all, the reform seems to be more in the nature of political window-dressing, consisting in a change in management of an existing saving fund, in order to show that something has been done to preserve the future standard of living of retirees. pension reforms, Sraffian theory, Italy...|$|R
