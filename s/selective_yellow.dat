40|$|Epidemic dropsy is a {{clinical}} state resulting from use of edible oils adulterated with Argemone mexicana oil. Sanguinarine and dehydrosanguinarine {{are two major}} toxic alkaloids of Argemone oil, which cause widespread capillary dilatation, proliferation and increased capillary permeability. Leakage of the protein-rich plasma component into the extracellular compartment leads {{to the formation of}} oedema. The haemodynamic consequences of this vascular dilatation and permeability lead to a state of relative hypovolemia with a constant stimulus for fluid and salt conservation by the kidneys. Illness begins with gastroenteric symptoms followed by cutaneous erythema and pigmentation. Respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath and orthopnoea progressing to frank right-sided congestive cardiac failure are seen. Mild to moderate anaemia, hypoproteinaemia, mild to moderate renal azotemia, retinal haemorrhages, and glaucoma are common manifestations. There is no specific therapy. Removal of the adulterated oil and symptomatic treatment of congestive cardiac failure and respiratory symptoms, along with administration of antioxidants and multivitamins, remain the mainstay of treatment. <b>Selective</b> cultivation of <b>yellow</b> mustard, strict enforcement of the Indian Food Adulteration Act, and exemplary punishment to unscrupulous traders are the main preventive measures.    Keywords: epidemic dropsy; Argemone mexicana; sanguinarine; Indi...|$|R

50|$|The {{intent of}} <b>selective</b> <b>yellow</b> {{is to improve}} vision by {{removing}} short, blue to violet wavelengths from the projected light. These wavelengths are difficult for the human visual system to process properly, and they cause perceived dazzle and glare effects in rain, fog and snow. Removing the blue-violet portion of a lamp's output to obtain <b>selective</b> <b>yellow</b> light can entail filter losses of around 15%, though {{the effect of this}} reduction is mitigated or countervailed by the increased visual acuity available with yellow rather than white light in bad weather.|$|E

50|$|Lamps are {{available}} that {{conform to the}} physical specifications for H1, {{but not to the}} regulated specifications for power consumption, light output, and/or light colour. These include high-wattage lamps, and those that emit light of a colour outside the white or <b>selective</b> <b>yellow</b> specification ranges. Such lamps are illegal throughout the industrialised world for use in regulated automotive lighting devices, and so vehicle wiring, switches, and lighting components are generally not designed or built to withstand the higher heat and power consumption from off-spec lamps. Lamps with higher-than-specified output can also create unsafe levels of glare. There is considerable variability by jurisdiction in the regulation of off-road applications of lamp types used in on-road vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108 {{requires}} DRLs on all {{new vehicles}} made or imported after January 1, 1990. Canada's proposed DRL regulation was essentially similar to regulations {{in place in}} Scandinavia, with an axial luminous intensity limit of 1,500 cd, but automakers claimed it was too expensive to add a new front lighting device, and would increase warranty costs (by dint of increased bulb replacements) to run the low beams. After a pitched regulatory battle, the standard was rewritten to {{permit the use of}} reduced-voltage high beam headlamps producing up to 7,000 axial candela, as well as permitting any light color from white to amber or <b>selective</b> <b>yellow.</b> These changes to the regulation permitted automakers to implement a less costly DRL, such as by connecting the high beam filaments in series to supply each filament with half its rated voltage, or by burning the front turn signals full-time except when they are actually flashing as turn indicators.|$|E
50|$|Vehicles {{typically}} include headlamps {{and tail}} lights. Headlamps are white or <b>selective</b> <b>yellow</b> lights {{placed in the}} front of the vehicle, designed to illuminate the upcoming road and to make the vehicle more visible. Many manufactures are turning to LED headlights as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional headlamps. Tail and brake lights are red and emit light to the rear so as to reveal the vehicle's direction of travel to following drivers. White rear-facing reversing lamps indicate that the vehicle's transmission has been placed in the reverse gear, warning anyone behind the vehicle that it is moving backwards, or about to do so. Flashing turn signals on the front, side, and rear of the vehicle indicate an intended change of position or direction. In the late 1950s, some automakers began to use electroluminescent technology to backlight their cars' speedometers and other gauges or to draw attention to logos or other decorative elements.|$|E
