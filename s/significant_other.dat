40|$|The dynamic {{relationship}} {{which is}} widely recognised to exist between a person’s pain and their social environment provides a strong {{argument for the}} inclusion of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> e. g. friends and family, in chronic pain management programmes. To date research concerning the involvement of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in chronic pain management programmes has been dominated by a quantitative approach, with a focus on comparing the effectiveness of programmes with and without the involvement of <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> What is missing from the literature is research illuminating the perspectives of those with pain and <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> about the involvement of friends and family in pain management programmes. This study utilised a qualitative descriptive methodology to investigate the question: “What are the views of individuals who have participated in a Family Day, delivered as part of the 3 week multidisciplinary chronic pain management programme at The Auckland Regional Pain Service (TARPS), on the involvement of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> within the programme?” The purpose of this research was firstly to investigate whether the theoretical rationale for involving <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> within a programme is supported in the views shared by those with pain and <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> Secondly, to provide TARPS with feedback on their service and this may in turn identify opportunities to enhance programme delivery. Thirdly, the findings will contribute to the body of knowledge that informs the delivery of pain management services in general. Semi-structured phone interviews were held with eight people who volunteered to participate in this study after attending a Family Day at TARPS. Conventional content analysis of the interview data resulted in the emergence of two themes: Firstly, the involvement of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in the programme is important so that everyone is on the same page about pain and its management and secondly, the involvement of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in the programme is important so that <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> have the opportunity to access information and support. These views reinforce what is already known about the psychosocial dimension of pain and lend support for the theoretical rationale which is commonly used to justify the involvement of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in a pain management programme. The findings also extend existing knowledge about the involvement of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in a pain management programme in three ways. Firstly, they highlight a wish for <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> to be directly involved in the programme, rather than via media such as the internet. Secondly, the findings point to the importance of involvement finding a balance between what is feasible for <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> and beneficial for all, and thirdly the need for the involvement of children in the programme to be carefully considered. To my knowledge this is the first study that has sought to ascertain views on the involvement of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in a chronic pain management programme, from the perspective of those with pain and <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> For those involved in the delivery of pain management services, the findings from this research highlight the urgent need for research into when and how <b>significant</b> <b>others,</b> including children, are involved within programme...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that the <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> of individuals with persistent back pain may have important influences on work participation outcomes. The aim {{of this study was to}} extend previous research by including individuals who have remained in work despite persistent back pain in addition to those who had become incapacitated for work, along with their <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> The purpose of this research was to explore whether the illness beliefs of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> differed depending on their relative’s working status, and to make some preliminary identification of how <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> may facilitate or hinder work participation for those with persistent back pain. Methods Interviews structured around the Illness Perception Questionnaire (chronic pain version) were conducted with back pain patients recruited from a hospital pain management clinic along with their <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> Some patients had remained in work despite their back pain; others had ceased employment. Data were analysed using template analysis. Results There were clear differences between beliefs about, and reported responses to, back pain symptoms amongst the <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> of individuals who had remained in employment compared with the <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> of those who had ceased work. Three overarching themes emerged: perceived consequences of back pain, specific nature of employment and the impact of back pain on patient identity. Conclusions <b>Significant</b> <b>others</b> of employed individuals with back pain focused on the extent to which activity could still be undertaken despite back pain symptoms. Individuals out of work due to persistent back pain apparently self-limited their activity and were supported in their beliefs and behaviours by their <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> To justify incapacity due to back pain, this group had seemingly become entrenched in a position whereby it was crucial that the individual with back pain was perceived as completely disabled. We suggest that <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> are clearly important, and potentially detrimental, sources of support to individuals with back pain. The inclusion of <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in vocational rehabilitation programmes could potentially be a valuable way of mobilising readily accessible resources in a way that supports optimal functioning. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES. We {{explored}} the clinical application of goal-directed therapy in community-based rehabilitation {{from the perspective}} of clients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), their <b>significant</b> <b>others,</b> and their treating occupational therapists. METHOD. Twelve people with TBI and their <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> completed an outpatient, goal-directed, 12 week occupational therapy program. Semistructured interviews with 12 participants, 10 <b>significant</b> <b>others,</b> and 3 occupational therapists involved in delivering the therapy programs {{explored the}}ir experiences of goal-directed therapy. RESULTS. Participants, their <b>significant</b> <b>others,</b> and therapists described goal-directed therapy positively, expressing satisfaction with progress made. CONCLUSION. Goals provide structure, which facilitates participation in rehabilitation despite the presence of barriers, including reduced motivation and impaired self-awareness. A therapist-facilitated, structured, goal-setting process in which the client, therapist, and <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> work in partnership can enhance the process of goal setting and goal-directed rehabilitation in a community rehabilitation context.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} main lines 4.Bf4, 4.Nf3 and 4.e4, the only <b>significant</b> <b>other</b> fourth move is 4.e3 to {{continue}} by 4...Nxe5 5.Nh3 (or the other move-order 4.Nh3 and 5.e3) so that the white knight starts the journey Ng1–h3–f4–d5 reach its ideal d5-square. The idea with 4.e3 and 5.Nh3 was favorite of a leading Soviet coach and writer Mikhail Shereshevsky, who wrote in his 1994 book The Soviet Chess Conveyor that the line was first shown to him by a strong correspondence player Donatas Lapienis. Black has tried to prevent White's idea by the suitably strange-looking move 5...Ng6, taking the f4-square from the Nh3. Then White can develop along various setups, the most active being 6.Qh5 with the possibility Nh3–g5 in store to recycle the knight towards a more central position. Black can also ignore White's intentions and concentrate on his own play by placing the Nb8 on c5, {{in order to put}} pressure on the d3-square. After 5...g6 6.Nf4Bg7 7.Be2 0-0 8.0-0 d6 9.Nc3 Nbd7 10.Qd2 a5 11.b3 Nc5 the position of Black's knights is secured and Black's position is similar to the Leningrad variation of the Dutch Defence (once he has played f7–f5). White has no reason, however, to abandon the a1–h8 diagonal to Black, and he can try 5...g6 6.Bd2 d6 7.Nf4 Bg7 8.Bc3 0-0 9.Be2 Nbd7 10.Nd2 b6 and in one game White gained a minimal edge.|$|E

The findings indicate that physiological stress reactivity predicts poor psychosocial functioning in survivors of TBI and their <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> Chronic stress (reflected in high baseline values) and stress reactivity were generally adversely associated with psychological distress and life satisfaction. Among <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> of TBI survivors, this pattern was also observed for sense of caregiving mastery and burden.

The construct of survivor awareness of deficits helped to elucidate this intriguing pattern of results.

30|$|Interestingly, {{this study}} found an {{emerging}} theme regarding family experiences of participants. Family experiences discussed earlier pointed out how family members or <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> of the gambler {{are affected by the}} gambling experience. The gamblers’ self-perception has clearly been defined by their gambling habit in relation to how they were treating their family members or <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> Thus, as mentioned in past research (Dickson-Swift et al., 2005; Corney and Davis, 2010; Valentine and Hughes, 2010), the family or <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> of the gambler do not only suffer from financial strains but may also be affected emotionally and psychologically. This is due to the inconsistency of the gamblers’ behaviours and actions toward their family members and <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> For example, when the gambler is perceived to be emulating his “good self,” he will spend more time and money on his family. However, when he is perceived to be emulating his “bad self,” he will cause turmoil and distress to his family members or <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> by neglecting them and increasing familial debt. Therefore, such inconsistencies in the gamblers’ behaviours may add to the stress and cognitive dissonance that the family or <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> experience.|$|R

Method Semi-structured interviews based on the Illness Perceptions Questionnaire were conducted with a purposive sample of UK disability benefit claimants, along with their <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> (n= 5 dyads). Data were analysed using template analysis. Results <b>Significant</b> <b>others</b> further reinforced and validated claimants' negative beliefs/illness perceptions, including fear of pain/re-injury associated with certain types of work, perceived job inflexibility and/or lack of support from employers. Keen in their desire to be viewed as a ‘good’ spouse/partner/close family member, <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> acted as a ‘witness to pain’, supporting claimants' self-limiting behaviour and statements of incapacity, often responding with assistance and empathy.

Aineistot kerättiin potilailta ja heidän läheisiltään kolmessa vaiheessa: yksi, kuusi ja 12 kuukautta potilaan ohitusleikkauksen jälkeen. Potilaiden terveyteen liittyvä elämänlaatu oli heikompaa kuin keskimäärin samanikäisellä väestöllä kun ohitusleikkauksesta oli kulunut yksi kuukausi. Sen sijaan läheisten kohdalla vastaavaa eroa ei ollut, vaan läheisten elämänlaatu oli samansuuntainen kuin samanikäisen väestön elämänlaatu. Seuranta-aikana sekä potilaiden että läheisten terveyteen liittyvä elämänlaatu parani. Potilaiden elämänlaatu oli kuitenkin läheisten elämänlaatua heikompi kaikilla mittauskerroilla. Sosiaalista tukea potilaat saivat läheisiä enemmän sekä tukiverkoston jäseniltä että hoitajilta. Potilailla keskeisiä elämänlaatua selittäviä tekijöitä olivat fyysisen rasituksen aiheuttamat sydänoireet ja lisäsairaudet. Mitä vähemmän fyysinen rasitus aiheutti potilaille sydänoireita, sitä paremmaksi he kokivat elämänlaatunsa. Potilaat, joilla ei ollut lisäsairauksia, arvioivat elämänlaatunsa muita paremmaksi. Läheisillä keskeinen elämänlaatua selittävä tekijä oli pitkäaikaissairaudet. Ne läheiset, joilla ei ollut pitkäaikaissairauksia, kokivat elämänlaatunsa muita paremmaksi. Lisäksi potilaiden ja läheisten elämänlaatua selitti alkutilanteen elämänlaatu. Ensimmäisessä vaiheessa kyselylomake lähetettiin 367 potilaalle ja läheiselle.

The {{purpose of}} this {{longitudinal}} study was to describe and compare the health related quality of life (HRQoL) of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients and <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> one, six and twelve months after surgery. A further concern was to describe patients and <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> access to social support and factors associated with HRQoL during the follow-up. The data were collected in three stages using questionnaires. In the first stage, i. e. one month after surgery, questionnaires were sent out to 367 patients and their <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> (N = 367). In the second stage, {{six months after the}} bypass operation, questionnaires were mailed to 271 patients and <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> Finally, in the third stage, 12 months after the operation, questionnaire were mailed to 266 patients and <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> HRQoL was measured by the generic 15 D instrument. Indicators for the measurement of social support received from preoperative group counselling, members of the support network and from nurses on the ward were specially developed for this research. Data analysis was based on statistical methods. The results showed that one month after the bypass operation, patients HRQoL was lower than in the age and gender standardised normal population. Among <b>significant</b> <b>others,</b> no difference was seen in comparison with the normal population. Comparison of patients and <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> HRQoL indicated higher scores for <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> throughout the follow-up. Differences between dimensions were decreased, however. During the follow-up the HRQoL of both patients and <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> improved. Shortness of breath and sleeping difficulties decreased {{during the course of the}} follow-up in patients and <b>significant</b> <b>others,</b> and they had less difficulty coping with everyday activities. Symptoms of anxiety and depression also decreased, and both groups showed increased energy levels and had an improved sex life. Patients received more social support than <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> from members of the support network, preoperative group counselling and from nurses while on the ward. The support network was primarily a source of emotional support for both patients and <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> Support for decision-making was received primarily through preoperative group counselling. During their time on the ward, patients and <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> were kept reasonably well or very well informed by nurses about the illness and various questions related to the illness. Among patients, key factors explaining HRQoL during the follow-up were cardiac symptoms caused by physical exertion, complicating illnesses and baseline HRQoL. Among <b>significant</b> <b>others,</b> the corresponding explanatory factors included chronic diseases and baseline HRQoL. This research produced new results and confirmed existing knowledge.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to build {{knowledge}} of a new client-centred {{activities of daily living}} (ADL) intervention (CADL), which takes the unique experiences of persons with stroke as the point of departure, and aims to enable agency in daily activities and participation in everyday life among persons with stroke. The focus of this thesis is an evaluation of CADL after stroke, from the perspectives of occupational therapists (OT), clients with stroke and their <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> Methods: Study I uses quantitative content analysis to explore how client-centredness is documented in 280 medical records by OTs who received training intended to enhance client-centredness, compared with OTs who had not received such training. Studies II and III are based on a multicentre randomized controlled trial (RCT) : Study II studies the effects of CADL compared with usual ADL (UADL), 3 months after the start of interventions on 280 people with stroke regards: independence in ADL, perceived participation, life satisfaction, use of home help service and satisfaction with training; and on the <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> of persons with stroke receiving CADL or UADL as regards caregiver burden, life satisfaction and provision of informal care. Study III compares the effects of CADL and UADL on the caregiver burden, provision of informal care, participation in everyday occupations and life satisfaction of 183 <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> up to one year after the persons with stroke were included in the study. Study IV has a grounded theory approach exploring and describing whether and if so, how CADL was integrated into everyday lives of the <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> of people with stroke who received CADL during the first year after the intervention. The findings in Study I show that OTs with client-centredness training recorded significantly more client participation in goal-setting than therapists without training. In Study II, 3 months after inclusion, there were no differences between the CADL group and UADL group in the outcomes of people with stroke or their <b>significant</b> <b>others,</b> except in the Stroke Impact Scale “Emotion” domain, which favours CADL intervention. Nor were there any differences in outcomes at 12 months between <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in the two groups, or in changes between 3 and 12 months in Study III. For <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in the CADL group, however, the odds were significantly lower regarding the “General strain” factor in Caregiver burden at 12 months compared to 3 months. The findings in Study IV indicate that CADL has been integrated into the everyday lives of the <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> An overall core category “Taking responsibility and achieving balance with respect to self-esteem to get on with everyday life”, and four interrelated subcategories represent a temporal process of interactions between <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> and persons with stroke in their daily activities in which <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> adapted themselves to achieve balance in everyday life. One further key aspect is that as persons with stroke acted upon their own activity goals, their <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> were encouraged to act on their own needs. Conclusion: It is possible to increase client-centredness through training. CADL has beneficial effects on the perceived impact of stroke on emotions at 3 months after stroke, there were no other differences in effects between CADL and UADL for people with stroke or their <b>significant</b> <b>others.</b> Among the <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in the CADL group, however, the experiences of burden seemed to decrease over time between 3 and 12 months, despite no change in informal care. Findings indicate that it was a transfer of learning from the person with stroke to the <b>significant</b> <b>others,</b> with a new shared learning. By initiating the CADL soon after the stroke, professionals involved such as OTs can support both the people with stroke and their <b>significant</b> <b>others</b> in adjusting to the new life situation. In order to tailor the interventions to meet the individual needs in everyday life, however, conducting follow-up sessions over a longer time period would be of importance...|$|R
