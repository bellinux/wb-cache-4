40|$|Traditional {{memory devices}} are facing more {{challenges}} due to continuous down-scaling. 6 T-SRAM suffers from variability [1 - 2] and reliability [3 - 4] issues, which introduce cell stability problems. DRAM cells with one transistor, one capacitor (1 T 1 C) struggle to maintain refresh time [5 - 6]. Efforts {{have been made}} to find new memory solutions, such as one transistor (1 T) solutions [7 - 9]. Floating body based memory structures are among the potential candidates, but impact ionization or band-to-band tunnelling (B 2 BT) limits their refresh time [10]. A recently proposed zero impact ionization and zero subthreshold <b>swing</b> <b>device</b> named Z 2 FET [9, 11 - 12] has been demonstrated and is a promising candidate for 1 T DRAM memory cell due to technology advantages such as CMOS technology compatibility, novel capacitor-less structure and sharp switching characteristics. In the Z 2 FET memory operation, refresh frequency is determined by data retention time. Previous research [11 - 12] is lacking systematic simulation analysis and understanding on the underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a new simulation methodology to accurately extract retention time in Z 2 FET devices and understand its dependency on applied biases, temperatures and relevant physical mechanisms. Since the stored ‘ 1 ’ state in Z 2 FET is an equilibrium state [9, 11 - 12] and {{there is no need to}} refresh, we will concentrate on state ‘ 0 ’ retention.

This research involves two complementary methods for addressing scaling issues. First is the development of two blind digital calibration techniques. Decision Boundary Gap Estimation (DBGE) removes static non-linearities and Chopper Offset Estimation (COE) nulls offsets in pipelined ADCs. Second is the development of circuits for a new architecture called zero-crossing based circuits (ZCBC) that is more amenable to scaling trends. To demonstrate these circuits and algorithms, two different ADCs were designed: an 8 bit, 200 MS/s in TSMC 180 nm technology, and a 12 bit, 50 MS/s in IBM 90 nm technology.

40|$|Electronic systems {{designed}} for use in deep space and planetary exploration missions are expected to encounter extreme temperatures and wide thermal <b>swings.</b> Silicon-based <b>devices</b> are limited in their wide-temperature capability and usually require extra measures, such as cooling or heating mechanisms, to provide adequate ambient temperature for proper operation. Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) technology, on the other hand, lately has been gaining wide spread use in applications where high temperatures are encountered.

40|$|Moore's law {{has driven}} {{technological}} improvements for decades by halving the areal footprint of the transistor {{every two years}} and increasing the performance of making integrated circuits while reducing their cost. The ability to reduce the footprint of the device was enabled by advances in processing technology, novel materials and device design. As ever-smaller footprints are desired, power density limitations and performance degradation require more innovations on all fronts. Recently introduced improvements to integrated circuits are high-K and metal gate for MOSFETs (45 -nm node onward), the FinFET (22 -nm node onward) and air gaps between copper interconnects (14 -nm node) illustrating that at every new technology node {{there needs to be}} a materials or process-related improvement to reduce power and maintain performance. Other approaches are also being explored or taken to further improve the MOSFET performance in future technology nodes, namely use of channel materials with higher carrier mobility such as SiGe and Ge for p-MOSFETs, III-V compound semiconductors for n-MOSFETs and steep subthreshold <b>swing</b> <b>devices</b> such as tunnel field effect transistors (TFETs). This work evaluates both approaches utilizing germanium (Ge) and strained-Ge as a material to understand the benefits and drawbacks to both approaches. Hypothetically, high carrier mobility and velocity channel materials can lower the overall power consumption because lower power supply voltage is required to obtain the same amount of current. Germanium and strained-Ge are candidates for the channel material of p-MOSFETs. MOSFETs made using Ge and strained-Ge as the channel material are evaluated based upon the ITRS roadmap requirements using experimental results in this work and data from literature. The approach for using TFETs was evaluated in this work also using germanium as a channel material. TFETs can have a steep subthreshold swing (SS), better than the minimum of 60 mV/decade at room temperature for a MOSFET, which also reduces the total power and supply voltage required for operation. The reduced SS is hypothetically achieved through the band-to-band tunneling which allows for the filtering of the Fermi-tail distribution of carriers. Experimentally, TFETs have not generally shown the steeper than Fermi-tail SS promised by the theory and this work uses both results from fabricated strained-Si/strained-Ge TFETs as well as modeling to explain why this has been the case. The challenges for both technologies are outlined in this thesis and suggestions are made on approaches to tackling their respective intrinsic problems from the point of view of Ge-based devices. by Winston Chern.

The switched capacitor multiplier circuit in pipelined ADC is one application which has been hindered by op-amp limitations. Zero Crossing Based (ZCB) switched-capacitor topologies have been proposed as an alternative to op-amp based circuits because ZCB circuits do not suffer from the same CMOS scaling issues. This research applies ZCB techniques to Time Interleaved ADCs (TIADC). Mismatch between the individual ADCs, or channels, that make up the TIADC degrade its accuracy and is a fundamental design challenge. This research addresses the mismatch issue by investigating new circuit techniques to reduce offset error and timing skew. A new method to analyze noise in ZCB topologies is also presented. These methods were used to design a 2 GS/S 8 -bit time-interleaved, pipelined ZCB ADC. Although applied to ZCB ADCs, the timing skew correction topology and noise analysis method are applicable to other ADC topologies. by Albert C. Chow. Thesis (Ph. D.)

30|$|The {{advantage}} of NW as a semiconducting channel in FeFET memory devices is the sensitive changes in conductance and the inherently small scale of each device, {{leading to a}} high memory device density. Single-crystalline nanowires and nanotubes often feature greater mobility and lower <b>swing,</b> allowing FET <b>devices</b> to operate at higher speed and lower power consumption. Because NW FETs function in accumulation and depletion modes, they allow lower operation voltage than thin-film FETs operating in inversion mode. Lower operation voltage in FeFETs can reduce the depolarization field in the ferroelectric layer and the charge trapping induced at the semiconducting/ferroelectric interface, leading to a longer memory state retention time [1, 2]. Furthermore, to form an omega-shaped-gate FeFET structure [20], the Si NW was coated with P(VDF-TrFE). Without a gate dielectric layer, the polarization of the ferroelectric layer will affect directly {{on the surface of}} the NW. This provides a more effective electric field with respect to the NW FET than the omega-shaped-gate and planar-gate FETs.

40|$|Golf {{is one of}} the few {{games that}} can be enjoyed by players of all ages and its {{popularity}} has grown consistently to achieve the largest sports equipment turnover in both the UK and the USA; consequently, more effort has been expended on golf related research than any other sport. Significant increases in golf equipment performance have been achieved within the past few decades; which in turn, have brought about increased demands for high-technology, high-performance golf equipment. Golfers are used extensively by manufacturers during the testing and development of equipment, where player performances, opinions and perceptions are valued sources of information, however, golfers are inconsistent in performance and they tire. One method of overcoming these shortcomings has been the development of golf <b>swing</b> simulation <b>devices</b> or robots which have been used increasingly over the last four decades. These produce consistent repeatable swings and are now intrinsic instruments for the scientific study of golf by manufacturers, governing bodies and academic institutes alike. The capability of artificial devices to perform human dynamic motions is undoubtedly improving; however, comparatively little scientific effort has been invested to ensure that the swing motions provided by these mechanical devices are representative of golfers' swings. A three-dimensional kinematic study of golfers' swings was undertaken to determine joint positions representative of a double pendulum simplification of the swing and shaft deflection and ball launch data were recorded to permit comparison. A technique for generating golf robot swing commands from the kinematic swing data was developed using interpolation algorithms that ensured the desired number of command joint positions and increased the continuity of the command position derivatives. The swing motions of six golfers with distinctive swing performance characteristics were replicated using a commercially available golf robot with independent axes control and a bespoke modified motion control system. The research has shown that the new robot control system in conjunction with 3 D kinematic swing data enables individual golfers' swings to be replicated with both high levels of accuracy and repeatability.

In this study, we demonstrate a simple and reliable oxygen plasma treatment, which mitigates the effects of unintentional doping created by surface defect cites, such as S vacancies, and surface contamination.

The Centre potential model was further applied to estimate the sub threshold drain current and the sub threshold <b>swing</b> of the <b>device.</b> An extensive analysis of the device parameters like the channel thickness, channel width, oxide thickness, channel length etc. on the sub threshold electrical parameters is demonstrated. This gives a highly accurate model which closely matches with the simulations. The models are verified by the simulations obtained from 3 -D numerical device simulator Sentaurus from Synopsys...|$|R
40|$|Stroke affects 700, 000 Americans {{per year}} {{resulting}} in the largest cause of long-term disability in the United States. Drop-foot is a common condition associated with residual disabilities of stokes and is characterized as a paralysis or weakness of the dorsiflexor muscles of the foot and ankle. The result is an abnormal gait cycle caused by the dragging of the foot and toes during the <b>swing</b> phase. This <b>device</b> attempts to incorporate key principles from Electromyography (EMG) biofeedback rehabilitation and active Ankle-Foot Orthosis (AFO) design into a single rehabilitation device. The goal is to achieve an improvement in gait symmetry between the affected and unaffected legs of stoke patients exhibiting drop-foot by providing an assisted dorsiflexion response triggered by the users own EMG signal during the swing phase. The design incorporates a modified walking brace utilizing a custom built ball-screw actuator driven by a DC motor. Surface electrodes placed over the tibialis anterior muscle of the user will record and analyze the EMG data in real-time. An EMG triggering threshold will be calibrated to each user’s ability {{to serve as a}} closed-loop control pathway for initiating the dorsiflexion response. Automatic motion capture gait analysis can be used to record markers placed on the participants lower limbs. A comparative review of the kinematics of both legs will be analyzed for symmetry during the patient’s normal gait cycle and the assisted gait cycle using the biofeedback AFO...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Golfers are used extensively for equipment testing and development, however, they are inconsistent in performance and they tire. Golf <b>swing</b> simulation <b>devices</b> overcome these shortcomings producing consistent repeatable swings and are now intrinsic instruments for golf research conducted by manufacturers governing bodies and academic institutes. The capability of artificial devices to perform human dynamic motions is undoubtedly improving; however, comparatively little scientific effort has been invested {{to ensure that the}} swing motions provided by these mechanical devices are representative of golfers' swings. An extensive 3 D kinematic study of golfers' swings was undertaken to determine joint positions representative of a double pendulum model of the swing along with ball launch and shaft deflection data. A technique for generating golf robot motion commands from the kinematic swing data was then developed using interpolation algorithms to increase the continuity of command derivatives. Six golfers' swings with distinctive swing performance characteristics were replicated using a commercially availablem odem golf robot and a bespokem otion control system. Quantitative data captured from 20 golfers were compared using gender and skill classifications. All golfers were found to perform consistent swing motions and the kinematic sequencing of joint segments supported the summation of speed principle. Higher skill rated golfers were found to perform swings with greater consistency, faster clubhead speeds at impact, faster down swings and greater delayed wrist releases. The research has shown that the new robot control system in conjunction with 3 D kinematic swing data and a feed-forward control enables in dividual golfer's swings to be replicated with both high levels of accuracy and repeatability. The capability for golfers' swings to be replicated accurately using a mechanical device provides new impetus for both clubfitting methodologies and optimisation of swing technique. However, the boundary constraint of the club at the robot's gripping mechanism was found to provide poor representation of golfers' grip, and consequently, the first bending mode of the club was excited during simulations and resultant shaft deflection and ball launch data correlated less well with the golfers' data. Development of the club gripping mechanism has been identified as an area for future research as the benefits of the new robot control system will only be fully realised if this interface is improved...|$|R
