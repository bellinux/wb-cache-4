50|$|In January 2004, Stewart {{teamed with}} Andy Wallace and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. in a Boss Motorsports Chevrolet to take {{fourth in the}} 24 Hours of Daytona sports car {{endurance}} race. The result does not show the trio's performance, however. They had dominated the race until the last two hours, when the <b>suspension</b> <b>cracked.</b> With 15 {{minutes left in the}} race and Stewart driving, one of the rear wheels came off, finally ending their run. In addition to placing fourth overall, the trio placed third in the Daytona Prototype class.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a number of}} recently installed Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems: a) on a 2 km double suspension bridge; b) on a long railway viaduct that has experienced cracking; and c) on a steel arch bridge in a seismically active area. Damage detection techniques have been applied based on high-frequency measurements of vibrations, pressure and strain, enabling a proper understanding of the structures’ behaviour to be gained. The diverse range of applications presented, designed in collaboration with structure owners and design engineers, includes damage detection on expansion joints of <b>suspension</b> bridges, <b>crack</b> analysis and correlation with accelerations of high-speed trains, and high-frequency performance monitoring of seismic devices. These case studies, based on both static and dynamic approaches, demonstrate the usefulness {{and ease of use}} of such systems, and the enormous gains in efficiency they offer...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} microscopic, in situ visualizations {{of spontaneous}} cracking in drying silica-poly(vinyl alcohol) aqueous <b>suspension</b> coatings. The <b>cracking</b> event was quantified by measuring numbers of nucleation points {{per unit area}} from acquired time-lapse video images. Direct imaging revealed that the primary nucleation rate decreases obeying a power-law, whereas the secondary nucleation rate first increases and then decreases with increase in the particle-to-polymer weight ratio. The resultant cross-over between two nucleation rates leads to a drastic morphology transition from isolated star-like cracks to interconnected ladder-like cracks. The maximum crack surface density was obtained at a critical cross-over particle loading...|$|R
50|$|Prevention {{could be}} helped by {{professional}} sports such as the National Hockey League pushing towards making hockey safer. Concussions have become a more common injury in hockey today and are being critiqued under a microscope for both their immediate and long-lasting effects. Concussion symptoms can last for an undetermined amount of time depending on the player and {{the severity of the}} concussion. There is also the potential of post-concussion syndrome, which can last for months after the concussion. Concussions damage the brain of a person and the brain controls everything in the body so to limit this severe injury to the highest percentage possible would be in everybody’s best interest. National Hockey League Commissioners have been pushing towards stricter rules and longer <b>suspensions</b> to <b>crack</b> down on concussions. There have been great strides taken in changing the rules to help concussion prevention but officials still have to continue to look into this considering the game is evolving at an extremely fast pace. Players also need to make it a responsibility within themselves to protect each other and not take runs at each other with a player with their head down. Taking all these things into consideration, this could help the prevention of concussions in the National Hockey League considerably.|$|R
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{study the}} impact response of concentrated suspensions of cornstarch and water. We hypothesize that the dynamically jammed region that propagates {{ahead of the}} impactor {{is responsible for the}} strong stress response to impact when it spans between solid boundaries. Using surface imaging and particle tracking at the boundary opposite the impactor, we observed that a visible structure and particle flow at the boundary occur with a delay after impact. We show the delay time is {{about the same time as}} the the strong stress response, confirming that the strong stress response is a consequence of this dynamically jammed structure spanning between the impactor and a solid boundary. We also elaborate on the structure of the dynamically jammed region once it spans from the impactor to a solid boundary. We observed particle flow in the outer part of the dynamically jammed region at the bottom boundary, with a net transverse displacement of up to about 5 % of the impactor displacement, which indicates shear. Direct imaging to the surface of the outer part of the dynamically jammed region reveals a change in surface structure that appears the same as the result of dilation in other cornstarch <b>suspensions,</b> and <b>cracks</b> like a solid. This shear and dilation are in contrast to the dynamically jammed region as it propagates through the bulk, where it is argued to exhibit no shear or decrease in packing fraction. These observations suggest the dynamically jammed structure can temporarily support stress like a soil or dense granular material along a network of frictional contacts between the impactor and solid boundary.

50|$|The LC88's {{strength}} was demonstrated {{at the next}} race in Mexico, when Alliot had a massive accident in practice. He was exiting the 240 km/h (149 mph) Peraltada Curve leading to the main straight when he drifted onto the outside kerb. This pitched the car directly across the track and into the pit wall, before it somersaulted back across the track and finally landed upside down on the grass opposite the pits. Alliot qualified 13th and was cleared to race the next day, and the car was rebuilt as the team had no spare car after the Monaco accident. Dalmas qualified 22nd. On race day, Alliot stalled on the grid and started from the back, and retired on lap 1 with a <b>cracked</b> <b>suspension</b> upright. Dalmas climbed to ninth by the finish, three laps down. The team's problems with damaged cars continued in Canada, where Dalmas crashed heavily in practice {{and was unable to}} qualify for the race in the fully repaired spare car that Alliot had used in Mexico. Alliot qualified 17th and climbed to seventh before running out of fuel on lap 67. He was classified tenth.|$|R
40|$|Gravity settling, {{rheology}} and particle-packing {{structure of}} aqueous alumina suspensions {{have been investigated}} using sub-micrometer alpha-Al 2 O 3 powders with an average particle size similar to 0. 2 mum dispersed in pure water. The suspension pH varied from 2 to 11. The interface that separated the supernatant from the sediment appeared to settle linearly with time during the sedimentation experiment, followed then by a gradual reach toward a minimal sediment height; to which, the height was pH and solids loading dependent. The suspensions tended to form a continuous particulate network that defined the gravity settling as phigreater {{than or equal to}} 0. 1 at pH 11. This resulted in a flocculated suspension structure which barely settled even after 24 h without disturbance. The flocculated suspensions exhibited correspondingly a shear-thinning flow character over given shear-rate range (gamma = 1 - 1000 s(- 1)) examined, in contrast to an apparent transition of flow toward shear thickening from the shear thinning for the better-dispersed suspensions (pH = 2) at relatively high shear rates (gamma {{greater than or equal to}} 100 s(- 1)). This finding suggested a breakdown of the particulate network into smaller flow units for the flocculated suspensions as shear rate was increased. Films made from the flocculated <b>suspensions</b> showed apparent <b>cracking</b> after drying. Microstructural examinations revealed that a pronounced grain growth occurred in the films made from the pH 2 suspensions after isothermal sintering. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd and Techna S. r. l.

40|$|There are {{increasing}} interests to alternate the microstructure {{and hence the}} properties of steels that are applied in various environment conditions using a work-efficient and energy-saving manner. The desirable microstructure evolution is often not achievable by means of conventional thermo-mechanical processing and solid-state phase transition. This thesis has considered four fundamental engineering problems, namely (i) the possibility of anti-aging processing for the aged steels in service at high temperature, (ii) {{the recovery of the}} lost strength for the steels at high temperature, (iii) the <b>suspension</b> of <b>crack</b> initiation and propagation during cold-working of steels with eutectoid microstructures and (iv) the regaining of strength during tempering of a steel containing martensite. Phase stability in the processing environment is the primary concern in each of the list problems because it presents, in thermodynamically, the possibility to achieve the goals using the designed processing. Electropulsing processing has been considered and integrated with the conventional thermomechanical processing in the development of this PhD thesis. The so-called electropulsing treatment utilises electric current pulses with high peak current density and short pulse duration. Due {{to the nature of the}} short duration pulse, the energy consumption is very low. The high current density enables a very strong impact of electropulsing on the microstructure evolution and hence is work efficient. Following results have been obtained through the study??? ???	Using the appropriate electropulsing parameters, the formed secondary phase (e. g. ??-phase) by precipitation in 316 L stainless steels at elevated temperature can be dissolved. Electropulsing processing can supress the precipitation and homogenize the alloying elements in the stainless steel. The stability of the secondary phases in the stainless steel has been changed by the imposed electropulse. ???	Electropulsing treatment is able to alternate the delta-ferrite phase transition. This has been proved in the treatment of 2205 duplex stainless steel. The new format of phase transition causes strengthening of the steel at high temperature. The stability of phases in the steel has been affected by the applied electropulsing treatment. ???	For the light steels containing high aluminium composition, electropulsing is able to affect the thermodynamic stability and grain morphology of ??-carbide. This leads to significant improvement of steel formability. ???	Application of electropulsing processing to dual-phase automotive steel changes the stability of martensite phase. The processing improve the mechanical properties and refined the microstructure of this steel. The fundamental understanding of the experimental observations has been developed based on the thermodynamic and kinetic analysis. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Crack repair {{is crucial}} since cracks {{are the main}} cause for the {{decreased}} service life of concrete structures. An original and promising way to repair cracks is to pre-incorporate healing agents inside the concrete matrix to heal cracks the moment they appear. Thus, the concrete obtains self-healing properties. The goal of our research is to apply bacterially precipitated CaCO 3 to heal cracks in concrete since the microbial calcium carbonate is more compatible with the concrete matrix and more environmentally friendly relative to the normally used polymeric materials. Diatomaceous earth (DE) {{was used in this}} study to protect bacteria from the high-pH environment of concrete. The experimental results showed that DE had a very good protective effect for bacteria. DE immobilized bacteria had much higher ureolytic activity (12 - 17 g/l urea was decomposed within 3 days) than that of un-immobilized bacteria (less than 1 g/l urea was decomposed within the same time span) in cement slurry. The optimal concentration of DE for immobilization was 60 % (w/v, weight of DE/volume of bacterial <b>suspension).</b> Self-healing in <b>cracked</b> specimens was visualized under light microscopy. The images showed that cracks with a width ranging from 0. 15 to 0. 17 mm in the specimens containing DE immobilized bacteria were completely filled by the precipitation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) were used to characterize the precipitation around the crack wall, which was confirmed to be calcium carbonate. The result from a capillary water absorption test showed that the specimens with DE immobilized bacteria had the lowest water absorption (30 % of the reference ones), which indicated that the precipitation inside the cracks increased the water penetration resistance of the cracked specimens...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} {{the discovery of a}} new method of patterning bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1) on a surface using a drying sessile drop. This work identifies bacterial suspension age and the length of time mica is exposed to the laboratory atmosphere as the key parameters which impact the behavior of the sessile drop and the resulting residue. Possible origins of mica aging and bacterial suspension aging are discussed in light of the literature and the experimental conditions. The residue area and the fraction of the residue area on which substantial bacteria and salt deposits remained after the drying of the drop (fill-in fraction) were measured via analysis of optical micrographs. In general, smaller residues are more filled in. For fresh bacterial suspensions, and short mica exposure times, the residue covers the largest area and is characterized by rings formed during discrete depinning events as the solvent evaporates. As the exposure time increases and the mica surface slowly picks up contaminants from the atmosphere, the drop residue shrinks in size and bacteria are deposited in a regular cellular film in the interior of the drop residue. The fraction of the interior area covered by the cellular film is well correlated with the mica exposure time. For sufficiently aged bacterial suspensions, residues are small and more filled-in than residues formed from fresh suspensions on similarly aged mica. In addition, the interior deposition pattern transitions from a cellular film characteristic of fresh <b>suspensions</b> to a <b>cracked</b> carpet pattern for aged suspensions. Suspension aging related changes in the residues are attributed to accumulation of organic materials such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and other bacterial components in the suspension. The suspension aging process is also observed to be at least partially dependent on ventilation of the suspension during aging...|$|R
