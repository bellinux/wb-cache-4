30|$|No {{measurements}} of air content were done, neither were any tests on slump or flow {{performed at the}} delivery-site. <b>Slump-test</b> results from the batch-plant {{are listed in the}} “Appendix”. Even if the rinsing of fibers prior to weighing was done as thoroughly as reasonably possible, slight residues, barely visible, may have affected the results, i.e. the recorded weight of synthetic fibers. The duration of mixing at the batch-plant has neither been specified nor recorded. The distance between batch-plant and delivery-site was 25  km (batches destined for steel fiber addition at delivery site) and 6.5  km (batches destined for synthetic macro fiber addition at the delivery site). However, the hauling-time was not recorded, and could vary due to e.g. traffic jams. This could affect the consistency of the concrete at the job-site. Considerable variations were noticed in the revolving speed of drums during transport, and also while mixing after the addition of fibers at the delivery site. These factors may have had an effect on the distribution of fibers in the concrete mass.|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} The segregation is {{a separation}} between components of concrete or fresh mortar, {{which can be}} caused by an insufficient malaxation or an excessive vibration or a more fluidity. Literature reports many tests to characterize concrete's maniability, <b>slump-test,</b> maniabilimeter LCPC, cylinder's tests, column's tests, ball's tests, pallet's tests, are some examples. It also exists some tests of hardened concrete or at beginning of hardening. These are generally based on the percentage of the coarse aggregates between the top and the bottom of the samples. This work objective is to study the mechanisms of concrete's segregation, to analyze the correlations between the various indices of segregation and theirs correlations with ultrasonic pulse velocities. The segregation characteri- zation of fresh concrete was carried out by the sieve test and that of the hardened concrete by a counting tech- nique of coarse aggregates on prismatic samples 10 x 10 x 50 cm 3. Ultrasonic velocities were carried out on the same samples for seventeen concretes compositions to determine an ultrasonic velocity ratio through the sample's top part on that of the bottom part. The six concretes that do not present segregation (sieve stability lower than 15 % and segregation resistance by counting higher than 95 %) have an ultrasonic segregation factor approaching 100 %. Thus, this ultrasonic method can be a fast alternative to characterize fresh concrete segregation. </div...|$|E
