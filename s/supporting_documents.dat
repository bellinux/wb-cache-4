5|$|Based on {{an anecdote}} about the Second World War by the Romani {{historian}} Jacques Sigot, {{the film was}} inspired by a Romani who escaped the Nazis with help from French villagers. It depicts the rarely documented subject of Porajmos (the Romani Holocaust). Other than a band of Romani people, the film has a character based on Yvette Lundy, a French teacher who was active in the French resistance and deported to a concentration camp for forging passports for Romani. Gatlif had intended to make a documentary but the lack of <b>supporting</b> <b>documents</b> led him to present it as a drama.|$|E
5|$|On April 22, 1844, Secretary Calhoun {{signed the}} treaty of {{annexation}} and ten days later delivered it to the Senate for consideration in secret session. The details of the treaty negotiations and <b>supporting</b> <b>documents</b> were leaked by Senator Benjamin Tappan of Ohio to the press. Tappan, a Democrat, was an opponent of annexation and of slavery. The terms of the Tyler-Texas treaty {{and the release of}} Calhoun's letter to British ambassador Richard Pakenham exposed the annexation campaign as a program to expand and preserve slavery. In the Pakenham letter, Calhoun alleged that the institution of slavery contributed to the physical and mental well-being of Southern slaves. The U.S. Senate was compelled to open its debates on ratification to public scrutiny, and hopes for its passage by the two-thirds majority required by the Constitution were abandoned by administration supporters. In linking Texas annexation to the expansion of slavery, Calhoun had alienated many who might previously have supported the treaty.|$|E

To retrieve such entity, people usually first locate a small set of <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> which contain answer entities, and then further detect the answer entities in this set. In the literature, people view the <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> as relevant documents, and their findings as a conventional document retrieval problem. In this paper, we will state that finding <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> {{and that of}} relevant documents, although sounds similar, have important differences. Further, we propose a logistic regression approach to find <b>support</b> <b>documents.</b> Our experiment {{results show that the}} logistic regression method performs significantly better than a baseline system that treat the <b>support</b> <b>document</b> finding as a conventional document retrieval problem...|$|R

5|$|Sotomayor's {{circuit court}} rulings {{led to her}} being {{considered}} a political centrist by the ABA Journal and other sources and organizations. Several lawyers, legal experts, and news organizations identified her as someone with liberal inclinations. In any case, the Second Circuit's caseload typically skewed more toward business and securities law rather than hot-button social or constitutional issues. Sotomayor tended to write narrow, practiced rulings that relied on close application of the law to the facts of a case rather than import general philosophical viewpoints. A Congressional Research Service analysis found that Sotomayor's rulings defied easy ideological categorization, but did show an adherence to precedent and an avoidance of overstepping the circuit court's judicial role. Unusually, Sotomayor read through all the <b>supporting</b> <b>documents</b> of cases under review; her lengthy rulings explored every aspect of a case and tended to feature leaden, ungainly prose. Some legal experts have said that Sotomayor's attention to detail and re-examination of the facts of a case came close to overstepping the traditional role of appellate judges.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} identifying persons with expertise knowledge on a given topic. Traditional methods usually estimate the relevance between the query and the <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> of candidate experts using, for example, a language model. However, the language model lacks the ability of identifying semantic knowledge, thus results in some right experts cannot be found due to not occurrence of the query terms in the <b>support</b> <b>documents.</b> In this paper, we propose a mixture model based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) to estimate a hidden semantic theme layer between the terms and the <b>support</b> <b>documents.</b> The hidden themes are used to capture the semantic relevance between the query and the experts. We evaluate our mixture model in a real-world system, ArnetMiner 1. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} proposed model outperforms the language models. ...|$|R

The two IV infusions were administered at his home, amounted to 16% of the total average male blood quantity, and contained saline, multivitamins and vitamin C. The World Anti-Doping Agency forbids such {{a large amount of}} fluids entering the body before competition as a preventive step against the possible masking of performance-enhancing drug use.
