This thesis provides a MATLAB (copyright) code and {{graphical user interface}} (GUI) which rapidly estimates the bending frequencies of rotating beams from the knowledge of bending frequencies of nonrotating beams. The approach {{is based on the}} Rayleigh energy method developed by Yntema. The beams may be rotating or nonrotating, cantilever or hinged, uniform or with linear mass and <b>stiffness</b> <b>distributions,</b> with or without root offsets from the axis of rotation; or uniform with or without tip mass. Especially, the frequencies of both nonrotating and rotating cases can be estimated for (a) beams with and without offset which have mass and <b>stiffness</b> <b>distributions</b> which can be approximated by linear relations and (b) beams with uniform mass and <b>stiffness</b> <b>distributions</b> plus a concentrated mass at the tip. Also, {{as a part of the}} MATLABÊ¼ code, the bending frequencies of rotating beams with arbitrary <b>stiffness</b> and mass <b>distributions</b> can be estimated given that the <b>stiffness</b> and mass <b>distributions</b> as well as mode shapes of the rotating beam are provided. In latter case, the mode shapes of nonrotating beams may be used to get rough estimations. The code also presents the nonrotating bending-mode shapes in conjunction with the bending frequencies. The code and GUI are intended for use as a subprogram of JANRAD computer program developed at the Naval Postgraduate School, but can also be used as a stand-alone MATLABÊ¼ program.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{applications}} where volume {{needs to be}} pressurised within a geometrical space for which conventional pressure vessels do not provide suitable solutions. Applications are for example found in pressure cabins for Blended Wing Body Aircraft and conformable pressure vessels for an incompressible medium {{that has to be}} stored in a pressurised environment, specifically liquid gasses (e. g. propane) or cryogenic applications. These applications demand conformable pressurised structures but up until now, there are no conformable pressurised structures with full spatial freedom, made from high specific strength materials and optimal structural efficiency realised yet. The aim of this thesis is to provide understanding in the analysis and structural design of conformable pressurized structures. This thesis will enable the development of conformable pressure cabins and pressure vessels. From a structural topology point of view, efficient structures are in-plane, rather than out-of-plane, loaded structures. In this thesis, it is shown by means of linear membrane analysis that any arbitrary combination of intersecting axi-symmetrical membrane structures will always carry the pressurization loads via in-plane stresses provided that there is a proper in-plane loaded reinforcement at the surface of intersection. The most well-known example of a structure like this is a cluster of soap bubbles. In this example, the axi-symmetrical membrane structure is a sphere and the intersecting walls are the in-plane loaded reinforcements. This type of conformable pressure vessel is therefore called the multi-bubble. Simple shapes like intersecting spheres, intersecting cylinders or intersecting toroids are easy to analyse but the analysis becomes complex when different types of axi-symmetric elements are intersecting each other. This problem has been tackled by the visual interpretation of the linear membrane theory. To solve for loads and forces in the multi-bubble, it is shown that the solution simply depends on pressure and geometric variables. The solution is only valid however when the shell has the optimal <b>stiffness</b> <b>distribution.</b> The optimal <b>stiffness</b> <b>distribution</b> causes the inflated shape to be identical to the original shape, only the size is different. The optimal <b>stiffness</b> <b>distribution</b> is derived in this thesis. Manufacturing restrictions and cost limitations might cause the optimal <b>stiffness</b> <b>distribution</b> not to be economically feasible. A non-optimal <b>stiffness</b> <b>distribution</b> causes a nonlinear membrane response. A modified linear membrane solution for orthotropic membranes is derived in this thesis to solve for forces and deformations in non-optimal membranes. Furthermore, the understanding of the membrane response of pressurised structures also enables the formulation of a tailored <b>stiffness</b> <b>distribution</b> in order to control/eliminate deformations in particular directions. This can ease the integration of the pressurized structure in the surrounding structure. The achievements of this research can be summarized into:.

40|$|The {{predictions}} of regressive lag-mode damping levels are {{correlated with the}} database of an isolated, soft-inplane, three-blade rotor operated untrimmed. The database was generated at the Army Aeroflightdynamics Directorate at Ames. The correlation covers {{a broad range of}} data, from near-zero thrust conditions in hover to high-thrust and highly stalled conditions in forward flight with advance ratio as high as 0. 55 and shaft angle as high as 20 degrees. In the experimental rotor, the airfoil or blade portion has essentially uniform mass and <b>stiffness</b> <b>distributions,</b> but the root flexure has highly nonuniform mass and <b>stiffness</b> <b>distributions.</b> Accordingly, the structural approximations refer to four models of root-flexure-blade assembly. They range from a rigid flap-lag model to three elastic flap-lag-torsion models, which differ in modeling the root flexure. The three models of root-flexure are: three root springs in which the bending-torsion couplings are fully accounted for; a finite-length beam element with some average mass and <b>stiffness</b> <b>distributions</b> such that the fundamental frequencies match those of the experimental model; and accurate modal representation in which the actual mass and <b>stiffness</b> <b>distributions</b> of the experimental root-flexure-blade assembly are used in calculating the nonrotating mode shapes. The four models of root-flexure-blade assembly are referred to as the rigid flap-lag model, spring model, modified model and modal model. For each of these four models of the root-flexure-blade assembly, the predictions are based on the following five aerodynamic theories: ear theory, which accounts for large angle-of-attack and reverse-flow effects on lift, and has constant drag and pitching moment; quasisteady stall theory, which includes quasisteady stall lift, drag and pitching moment characteristics of the airfoil section, dynamics stall theory, which uses the ONERA dynamic stall models of lift, drag and pitching moment; dynamic wake theory, which is based on a finite-state three-dimensional wake model and includes all wake effects including both shed and trailing vorticity; and dynamics and wake theory, which combines both dynamic stall theory and dynamic wake theory and is a relatively complete aerodynamic representation...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look for}} {{nonuniform}} rotating beams that are isospectral to a given uniform nonrotating beam. A rotating nonuniform beam is isospectral to the given uniform nonrotating beam if both the beams have the same spectral properties, i. e., both the beams have {{the same set of}} natural frequencies under a given boundary condition. The Barcilon-Gottlieb type transformation is proposed that converts the governing equation of a rotating beam to that of a uniform nonrotating beam. We show that there exist rotating beams isospectral to a given uniform nonrotating beam under some special conditions. The boundary conditions we consider are clamped-free and hinged-free with an elastic hinge spring. An upper bound on the rotation speed for which isospectral beams exist is proposed. The mass and <b>stiffness</b> <b>distributions</b> for these nonuniform rotating beams which are isospectral to the given uniform nonrotating beam are obtained.
