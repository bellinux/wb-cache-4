5|$|The longer 7.5cm {{guns were}} a mixed blessing. In {{spite of the}} designers' efforts to {{conserve}} weight, the new weapon made the vehicle nose-heavy to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> the forward suspension springs were under constant compression. This resulted in the tank tending to sway even when no steering was being applied, an effect compounded {{by the introduction of}} the Ausführung H in March 1943.|$|E
5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E

It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher.

5|$|In 2007, the Court {{upheld a}} federal statute banning partial-birth {{abortion}} in Gonzales v. Carhart. University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey R. Stone, a former colleague of Scalia's, criticized Gonzales, stating that religion had influenced the outcome because all five justices {{in the majority}} were Catholic, whereas the dissenters were Protestant or Jewish. This angered Scalia to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> he stated he would not speak at the University of Chicago as long as Stone was there.|$|E

5|$|In January 2006, Flying Scotsman duly {{entered the}} National Railway Museum's {{workshops}} {{for a major}} overhaul to return it to Gresley's original specification and to renew its boiler certificate.

5|$|In addition, a {{programme}} of modernising {{many of the}} Underground's busiest central London stations was started; {{providing them}} with escalators to replace lifts.

5|$|In his memoirs, Władysław Szpilman also {{compared}} {{himself to}} Crusoe and, like Fogelman, emphasized the isolation and hopelessness which characterized the Warsaw Crusoes. Szpilman's memoir {{served as a}} basis for a screenplay, written as early as 1945 by the Polish writers Jerzy Andrzejewski and Czesław Miłosz, entitled Robinson of Warsaw. The movie that was eventually filmed, Miasto Nieujarzmione ("Unyoked city"), was heavily censored by the communist authorities, and its original theme changed to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> Miłosz requested his name be removed from the film's credits.

5|$|Initially, Littell {{thought that}} his book would sell around {{three to five}} {{thousand}} copies.

The wooden platform at Hellingly station was drastically shortened in 1922. Because service levels depended on patient numbers and the hospital's coal and food requirements, the line never operated to a timetable. By 1931, passenger numbers had fallen to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> the hospital authorities no longer considered passenger usage of the line to be economical, and the passenger service was withdrawn. The passenger car was moved to the hospital grounds, fitted with an awning, and became the hospital's sports pavilion. surviving into the mid-1990s before being destroyed in a fire started by vandals. The wooden platform at Hellingly station was removed in 1932, and the platform at the hospital was converted into a coal bay.|$|E
