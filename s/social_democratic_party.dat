5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2006 Swedish general election, Reinfeldt was {{subjected}} to a smear campaign. Mats Lindström, a staff member in the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> headquarters, admitted to sending e-mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud, false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father's influence. The IP address used in the e-mails was traced to the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> headquarters. <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable. A short time after the e-mail campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> and subsequently leaked to the media. <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the Social Democratic Youth League, but denied the existence of an official smear campaign and stated that the material was not meant to be released or spread to a wider audience.|$|E

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> are {{increasingly}} supportive of European integration. Existing explanations {{view this as}} either a reassertion of social democracy at the supranational level, an adaptation to contemporary political institutions, or {{part of a general}} ideological moderation. This article argues that support for the EU enables <b>social</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> to proclaim the possibility of social democracy at the supranational level, despite the absence of a substantive <b>social</b> <b>democratic</b> agenda. Thus, European integration enables <b>social</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> to achieve legitimation by obfuscation through integration.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> {{have changed}} their electoral appeals {{substantially}} to cater to new voter segments. This article examines social democracy’s fortunes in attracting new voters among the salaried middle class across different electoral systems. Previous research ignored the importance of electoral systems and was inconclusive as to whether <b>social</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> succeeded in mobilizing new constituencies. I argue that electoral systems {{play a crucial role}} since proportional systems enhance the electoral competiveness of left-libertarian parties, social democracy’s most serious challengers among the salaried middle class. In contrast, majoritarian systems allow <b>social</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> to gain a foothold among these voters as left-libertarians remain marginalized. Using ISSP data for 11 Western democ-racies, the findings demonstrate that <b>social</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> were outperformed by their left-libertarian challengers among the salaried middle class under highly proportional systems, but not under majoritarian systems...|$|R

50|$|Critiques to Przeworski’s {{account of}} the {{dilemmas}} of <b>social</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> {{have been at least}} twofold. First, {{it has been shown that}} numerical majority is not necessary for <b>social</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> to control governments, which implies that <b>social</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> do not necessarily need to sacrifice workers’ votes to win elections. Second, Gøsta Esping-Andersen has argued that Przeworski is mistaken in attempting to differentiate reformist and revolutionary policies, since “we have no accepted criteria for deciding which actions will merely reflect the status quo and which will accelerate historical transformation”. Esping-Andersen suggests that policies that leftist parties adopt should be compared based on how they aid the process of class unity.|$|R

This research on Saskatchewan and Quebec <b>social</b> <b>democratic</b> governments is important to students of public sector innovation because these provinces have often been the most innovative in Canada (see also, for example, Glor, 1997, 2002 in which I identify 159 innovations of the Saskatchewan government of 1971 - 82).

40|$|A {{plurality}} of {{interpretations of the}} reasons behind the evolution ofthe <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>parties</b> exists. Underestimated though in this literature is {{the exploration of the}} influence that the close involvement of the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>parties</b> with the European Integration process and the emerging European Polity i. e. the European Union has had in the ideological evolution of the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>parties.</b> My thesis constitutes a mix research design were the combination of quantitative research (Party Manifesto Data) is combined with Qualitative Research (Case Studies). The analysis and quantitative evaluation of the manifestos that the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>parties</b> have presented to the electorate, allows me to detect the evolution of the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> parties' ideology objectively and thus establish the ideological trends that exist across country and time, without facing any methodological differences due to data unavailability or data incompatibility. Variables which constitute core elements of Social Democracy party ideology are thus selected and the findings of our research graphically presented. The evolvement of the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>parties</b> to the most pro European Union party family is established. The findings of the Party Manifesto data is then cross examined with the data provided by the Euro barometer surveys. Two case studies are under taken in order to establish that the results of our quantitative research are valid. The French PS and Greek PASOK are selected in order to represent the European Union's core and periphery as well as different economic development s~atus. As the European Integration has been embedded with neoliberal policies, the long march of the <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>parties</b> from the implementation of one state Keynesian economic policy to the search for a <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> European polity has ended with the incorporation of the neoliberal paradigm within the Social Democracy ideology.

40|$|Despite the {{pervasive}} myth {{that the major}} political parties in Western Europe are forming powerful and stable party cartels and are closing the electoral market, the opposite seems to be occurring.
