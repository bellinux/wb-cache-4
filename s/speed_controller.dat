2500|$|The U.S. Big Three {{automakers}} {{had their}} own electric car programs during the late-1960s. In 1967, much smaller AMC partnered with Gulton Industries {{to develop a new}} battery based on lithium and a <b>speed</b> <b>controller</b> designed by Victor Wouk. A nickel-cadmium battery supplied power to an all-electric 1969 Rambler American station wagon. Other [...] "plug-in" [...] experimental AMC vehicles developed with Gulton included the Amitron (1967) and the similar Electron (1977). More battery-electric concept cars appeared over the years, such as the Scottish Aviation Scamp (1965), the Enfield 8000 (1966) and two electric versions of General Motors gasoline cars, the Electrovair (1966) and Electrovette (1976). None of them entered production.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, AMC and Sonotone Corporation {{announced}} {{work on a}} car to be {{powered by}} a [...] "self-charging" [...] battery. It was to have sintered plate nickel-cadmium batteries. During the 1960s, AMC partnered with Gulton Industries {{to develop a new}} battery based on lithium and to use an advanced <b>speed</b> <b>controller</b> designed by Victor Wouk. However, the actual running prototype was a 1969 Rambler American station wagon converted from [...] V8 to an all car electric using nickel–cadmium batteries. Power consisted of 160 cells, each rated at 75 ampere-hours (Gulton KO-75), arranged in two banks of 80 cells each, and connected in parallel. The equipment Wouk designed [...] "gave it good acceleration, but there was still a problem with the car's range." [...] Later, AMC and Gulton developed the Amitron and the similar Electron city cars.|$|E

50|$|Fuel {{is pumped}} from an inline {{injection}} pump to the injection nozzles. The injection pump is a pump with a rotational <b>speed</b> <b>controller,</b> fuel filter and a pump clutch. Some engines have an injection timing device {{instead of the}} pump clutch. The rotational <b>speed</b> <b>controller</b> is either an all-speed controller or an idle <b>speed</b> <b>controller.</b> The speed controllers are driven by the camshaft of the injection pump. The idle <b>speed</b> <b>controller</b> does affect the idle and redline speed only, while the all-speed controller affects every rotation speed. For fuel filtering a paper filter is used.|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} paralleling {{characteristics of}} two 1200 -Hz Brayton-cycle alternators are presented. Since the Brayton power conversion system uses electric <b>speed</b> <b>controllers,</b> the paralleling requirements are somewhat {{different from those}} for conventional ground-based power systems. Results include the transient effects of synchronizing the two alternators with various phase-angle, voltage, and frequency differences. Based on these results, the effects of synchronizing differences can be defined, and adjustment requirements of the parasitic <b>speed</b> <b>controllers</b> during synchronizing can be established. Data indicate that parasitically loaded alternators are able to parallel {{over a wide range}} of synchronizing differences...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Persistent robot {{tasks such}} as {{monitoring}} and cleaning are concerned with controlling mobile robots {{to act in a}} changing environment in a way that guarantees that the uncertainty in the system (due to change and to the actions of the robot) remains bounded for all time. Prior work in persistent robot tasks considered only robot systems with collision-free paths that move following <b>speed</b> <b>controllers.</b> In this paper we describe a solution to multi-robot persistent monitoring, where robots have intersecting trajectories. We develop collision and deadlock avoidance algorithms that are based on stopping policies, and quantify the impact of the stopping times on the overall stability of the <b>speed</b> <b>controllers.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of an {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV), one crucial problem is the flight autonomy of the overall system. The powertrain of electric UAVs, namely: battery, electronic <b>speed</b> <b>controllers,</b> motors and propellers has been analysed to evaluate their effect on {{the efficiency of the}} system, and thus the autonomy. Current literature and datasheets on UAV performances, especially on electric motor and propeller, are usually scattered and poor. Two different test benches have been developed to characterize <b>speed</b> <b>controllers,</b> motors and propellers; experimental results have been used to tune motor-propeller numerical models. The proposed work allowed to shade some doubts about the reliability of the available data and validate a model-based design methodology...|$|R
50|$|The main {{difference}} between a permanent magnet synchronous motor and an asynchronous motor is the rotor.

50|$|Since {{the output}} {{pressure}} of a centrifugal pump {{varies with the}} square of the speed, pressure can be controlled accurately by controlling the speed of the pump. For example: a pump runs at 1785 RPM during shutoff with an output pressure of 204 PSI and a suction pressure of 0 PSI. If the speed of the motor is reduced by 10% to 1607 RPM, the new output pressure becomes 165 PSI. This in turn enables the Variable <b>Speed</b> <b>Controller</b> to maintain a perfectly flat pump discharge curve until the full rating of the pump is reached. Further, the variable <b>speed</b> <b>controller</b> adjusts for varying suction pressure - as in the following example: a city water supply of 65 PSI drops to 26 PSI while flowing. The variable speed drive will speed up to adjust for the sudden drop in pressure and slow down again when it is not needed - all the while maintaining a constant total discharge pressure.|$|E
