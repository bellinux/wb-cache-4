5|$|In {{line with}} the hadith's {{prohibition}} against creating images of sentient living beings, which is particularly strictly observed with respect to God and Muhammad, Islamic religious art {{is focused on the}} word. Muslims generally avoid depictions of Muhammad, and mosques are decorated with calligraphy and Quranic inscriptions or geometrical designs, not images or sculptures. Today, the interdiction against images of Muhammad– designed to prevent worship of Muhammad, rather than God– is much more strictly observed in Sunni Islam (85%–90% of Muslims) and Ahmadiyya Islam (1%) than among Shias (10%–15%). While both <b>Sunnis</b> <b>and</b> Shias have created images of Muhammad in the past, Islamic depictions of Muhammad are rare. They have, until recently, mostly been limited to the private and elite medium of the miniature, and since about 1500 most depictions show Muhammad with his face veiled, or symbolically represent him as a flame.|$|E

25|$|The first {{centuries of}} Islam {{gave rise to}} three major sects: <b>Sunnis,</b> Shi'as <b>and</b> Kharijites. Each sect {{developed}} distinct jurisprudence schools (madhhab) reflecting different methodologies of jurisprudence (fiqh).|$|R

25|$|The {{fertility}} rate fell from 5.00 in 1971 to 1.75 in 2004. Fertility rates vary considerably {{among the different}} religious groups: in 2004 it was 2.10 for Shiites, 1.76 <b>Sunnis</b> <b>and</b> 1.61 for Maronites.|$|E
25|$|Some tension {{developed}} between <b>Sunnis</b> <b>and</b> Shia {{as a result}} of clashes over Iranian pilgrims and Saudi police at the hajj. Millions of Saudi adhere to the school of Salafism which is a branch of Sunni Islam.|$|E
50|$|The team, {{a mixture}} of <b>Sunnis,</b> Shias <b>and</b> Kurds, {{received}} worldwide acclaim for becoming continental champions from a background of bloodshed and violence and helping to temporarily unite a fractured nation.|$|R

25|$|According to Alertnet, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, {{speaking}} from the Lebanese capital, Beirut, echoed {{the opinions of}} Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and accused the United States of attacking the shrine to cause tension between the <b>Sunnis</b> <b>and</b> Shi'ites in the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|The Safavid {{experience}} largely {{created the}} clear line of political demarcation and hostility between Twelver Shiism and Sunnism, even though doctrinal differences {{had long been}} recognized. Before the Safavids the Twelvers for many centuries had mostly accommodated themselves politically to the <b>Sunnis,</b> <b>and</b> numerous religious movements combined Twelver and Sunni ideas.|$|E
25|$|Sources {{estimate}} the Christian population at 80–90%, with Roman Catholics representing {{the largest group}} at 60–65%. Protestant and Anglican practitioners constitute the remaining 15–25%. An estimated 5% of the population adheres to traditional indigenous religious beliefs. Muslims constitute 2–5%, the majority of whom are <b>Sunnis</b> <b>and</b> live in urban areas.|$|E

50|$|This book clarifies the Shi'ite logic. The Sunnis can {{correctly}} {{learn about}} the Shi'i through this book. Correct recognition of the Shi'ahs brings {{the views of the}} Shi'ahs <b>and</b> the <b>Sunnis</b> closer, <b>and</b> they can make a unified rank.|$|R
5000|$|Shiites {{are banned}} from {{building}} mosques {{and other religious}} centers, and are forced to perform Friday prayers in homes (Al-Hassan). In the Eastern city of Al-Khobar, whose population is predominately Shia, there are no Shia mosques. [...] Saudi Arabia's religious police mandate prayers and all those in public buildings during prayer time are required to stop {{what they are doing}} to pray. Because there are minor differences between the way that Shiites <b>and</b> <b>Sunnis</b> pray <b>and</b> between prayer times, Shiites are forced to either pray the Sunni way or take a break from work.|$|R
25|$|How {{much success}} Zia had using state-sponsored Islamisation to {{strengthen}} national cohesion is also disputed. Religious riots {{broke out in}} 1983 and 1984. Sectarian divisions between <b>Sunnis</b> <b>and</b> Shia worsened {{over the issue of}} the 1979 Zakat ordinance, but differences in fiqh jurisprudence also arose in marriage and divorce, inheritance and wills and imposition of hadd punishments.|$|E
25|$|Arab states {{especially}} Saudi Arabia and GCC {{states have}} been funding extremist Deobandi <b>Sunnis</b> <b>and</b> Wahhabis in Pakistan, since the Afghan Jihad. Whereas Iran has been funding Shia militant groups such as Sipah-e-Muhammad Pakistan, resulting in tit-for-tat attacks on each other. Pakistan has become a battleground between Saudi Arabia-funded Deobandi Sunni and Wahhabis and Iran-funded Shia resulting {{in the deaths of}} thousands of innocent Muslims.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} 1979 revolution, Sunni leaders from Kurdistan, Balouchistan, and Khorassan, {{set up a}} new party known as Shams, which is short for Shora-ye Markaz-e al Sunaat, to unite <b>Sunnis</b> <b>and</b> lobby for their rights. But six months after that they were closed down, bank {{accounts}} suspended and had their leaders arrested by the government on charges that they were backed by Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|Many <b>Sunnis,</b> Ismaili <b>and</b> Zaidiyyah {{argue that}} the 11th Imam, of the Twelver Shia, Hassan al-Askari, {{did not have a}} son. Twelver Shias say his birth was concealed. Others argue that even if he had a son, Muhammad ibn al-Hassan could not live for over a {{thousand}} years.|$|R
25|$|Support for the Abbasid Revolution {{came from}} people of diverse backgrounds, with almost {{all levels of}} society {{supporting}} armed opposition to Umayyad rule. This was especially pronounced among Muslims of non-Arab descent, though even Arab Muslims resented Umayyad rule and centralized authority over their nomadic lifestyles. Both <b>Sunnis</b> <b>and</b> Shias supported efforts to overthrow the Umayyads, as did non-Muslim subjects of the empire who resented religious discrimination.|$|E
25|$|Mohammad Abduh {{made great}} efforts to preach harmony between <b>Sunnis</b> <b>and</b> Shias. Broadly speaking, he preached brotherhood between all {{schools of thought}} in Islam. Abduh {{regularly}} called for better friendship between religious communities. As Christianity was the second biggest religion in Egypt, he devoted special efforts towards friendship between Muslims and Christians. He had many Christian friends and many a time he stood up to defend Copts.|$|E
25|$|With the {{eruption}} of the Syrian Civil War, tensions increased between the Shia-affiliated Alawites and Sunnis of Tripoli, erupting twice into deadly violence - in June 2011, and {{the second time in}} February 2012. The Syrian war has affected Hezbollah, which was once lauded by both <b>Sunnis</b> <b>and</b> Shi'ites for its battles against Israel, but now has lost support from many Sunnis for its military assistance to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.|$|E
50|$|You {{can also}} see a brotherlyhood between Shias <b>and</b> <b>Sunnis</b> as they are equal in {{population}} and a good understanding between them.|$|R
5000|$|Maliki's critics {{assert that}} he did his utmost to limit the power of both Kurds <b>and</b> <b>Sunnis</b> between 2006 <b>and</b> 2014. Their view is that Maliki worked to further {{centralise}} governance and amass greater controls and power—from militarily to legislative—for his party. Instead of strengthening and securing Iraq, Maliki's actions {{have led to a}} rise in both Kurdish nationalism and Sunni insurgency, which has resulted in civil war and the effective failure of the Iraqi state.|$|R
50|$|Lebanon {{demographics}} {{is roughly}} split amongst <b>Sunnis,</b> Shias <b>and</b> Christians (most {{of whom are}} Maronite). Due to the demographic concerns, amid fears the country could be a powder keg, a census has not been carried out since 1932. Since then the government has only published rough estimates of the population.|$|R
25|$|In 2012, the Syrian {{civil war}} {{threatened}} {{to spill over}} in Lebanon, causing more incidents of sectarian violence and armed clashes between <b>Sunnis</b> <b>and</b> Alawites in Tripoli. As of 6 August 2013, more than 677,702 Syrian refugees are in Lebanon. As the number of Syrian refugees increases, the Lebanese Forces Party, the Kataeb Party, and the Free Patriotic Movement fear the country’s sectarian based political system is being undermined.|$|E
25|$|Shiism did {{not become}} fully {{established}} until the reign of Abbas I of Persia (1587–1629). Abbas hated the <b>Sunnis,</b> <b>and</b> forced the population to accept Twelver Shiism. Thus by 1602 most of the formerly Sunnis of Iran had accepted Shiism. A significant number, however, did not accept Safavid rule, prompting Abbas to institute a number of administrative changes {{in order to further}} transform Iran into a Twelver Shia state.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} an early Shia–Sunni fitna shootout {{occurred}} in Kurram, one of the tribal agencies of the Northwest Pakistan, where the Pushtun population was split between <b>Sunnis</b> <b>and</b> Shia. In September 1996 more than 200 people were killed when a gun battle between teenage Shia and Sunni escalated into a communal war that lasted five days. Women and children were kidnapped and gunmen even executed out-of-towners who were staying at a local hotel.|$|E
50|$|By September, sectarian clashes and bloodshed in Homs between Alawites <b>and</b> <b>Sunnis</b> {{played a}} larger role in Homs than in the rest of Syria.|$|R
50|$|Since Shias <b>and</b> <b>Sunnis</b> have {{different}} sources of hadith, {{they tend to}} come to different conclusions regarding whom the enemies of Ahl al-Bayt are.|$|R
25|$|Shiite Safavid dynasty {{destroyed}} {{what was}} once a vibrant community of Zoroastrians, adherents of the pre-Islam religion of Iran. As per the official policy, Safavids wanted everyone to convert to the Shia sect of Islam and killed hundreds of thousands of <b>Sunnis,</b> Zoroastrians <b>and</b> other minorities when they refused to follow these orders.|$|R
