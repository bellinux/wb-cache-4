500|$|Jonathan Lethem {{wrote of}} the {{influence}} The End of the Road had on his novel As <b>She</b> <b>Climbed</b> Across the Table (1997), which also involves a love triangle in an academic setting. [...] In Lethem's novel, the narrator, in a position similar to Joe Morgan's, experiences the dilemma of [...] "losing a woman to a rival who", like Jake Horner, [...] "refuses to provide any fixed identity to hate, compete with, or understand".|$|E
500|$|His {{next book}} was Amnesia Moon (1995). [...] Partially {{inspired}} by Lethem's experiences hitchhiking cross-country, this second novel uses a road narrative {{to explore a}} multi-post-apocalyptic future landscape rife with perception tricks. [...] After publishing many of his early stories in a 1996 collection, The Wall of the Sky, the Wall of the Eye, Lethem published his third novel, As <b>She</b> <b>Climbed</b> Across the Table (1997). It starts with a physics researcher {{who falls in love}} with an artificially generated spatial anomaly called [...] "Lack", for whom she spurns her previous partner. [...] Her ex-partner's comic struggle with this rejection, and with the anomaly, constitute the majority of the narrative.|$|E
