For this {{it is important that the}} parameters of this model are accurately known. In this paper we contribute a method to estimate the base parameters of the full 3 D CoM model of humanoid robots. This method only uses measurements of the joint angles and <b>static</b> <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> for a number of postures. We also contribute a method to determine optimal stable measurement postures. The estimation method is verified in experiments on humanoid robot TUlip and a statistical analysis is performed to check the reliability of the estimated base parameters. I...|$|E
40|$|We present {{experimental}} {{measurements of}} penetration depths for {{the impact of}} spheres into wetted granular media. We observe that the penetration depth in the liquid saturated case scales with projectile density, size, and drop height in a fashion consistent with the scaling observed in the dry case, but that penetration depths into saturated packings tend to be smaller. This result suggests that, for the range of impact energies observed, the stopping force is set by <b>static</b> <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> between grains within the bed, and that the presence of liquid serves, primarily, to enhance these contact forces. The enhancement to the stopping force has a complicated dependence on liquid fraction, accompanied by a change in the drop-height dependence, that must be the consequence of accompanying changes in the conformation of the liquid phase in the interstices.

40|$|A new hybrid {{diverter}} {{design for}} an On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC) is presented and experimentally validated. The design differs from existing semiconductor-assisted OLTC systems {{in that the}} part of the system containing semiconductor devices is connected in a purely shunt con guration to the main current path, resulting in a system that is electrically robust and very low loss. The new design provides zero-current, zero-voltage operation of both diverter switches at all times, eff ectively eliminating arc-induced contact wear. Contact lifetime of over twenty-five million operations is demonstrated. Contact wear rates under the new design are compared experimentally with those under alternative contact protection schemes and are shown to be dramatically reduced. A fast electromechanical switch intended for use under the new hybrid diverter is presented. The low-wear conditions created by the new diverter allows a dramatic reduction in the switch moving mass when compared to that of the standard OLTC, allowing sub-half-cycle actuation times to be achieved. A study of switch topology is made in order to guide the design process. An analysis of a magnetic actuator providing both high actuation and <b>static</b> <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> is also presented. In a second strand of this thesis, a general method of formulating optimal modulation problems for thin power electronic systems incorporating a buck converter is presented. The method is employs a frequency domain representation of the buck converter where the describing equations are formed into a square matrix relating a set of input harmonics to sets of output harmonics. This allows the interaction between the buck converter and a set of linear filters to be modelled in a systematic way. Two example circuits, the Inverter-Less Active Filter and the Controllable Network Transformer, are used as example problems. The use of general-purpose optimisation software for finding optimal modulation waveforms for these circuits is demonstrated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|To {{manipulate}} an object, we must simultaneously {{control the}} <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> exerted on {{the object and}} the movements of our hand. Two alternative views for manipulation have been proposed: one in which motions and <b>contact</b> <b>forces</b> are represented and controlled by separate neural processes, and one in which motions and forces are controlled jointly, by a single process. To evaluate these alternatives, we designed three tasks in which subjects maintained a specified <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> while their hand was moved by a robotic manipulandum. The prescribed <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> and hand motions were selected in each task to induce the subject to attain one of three goals: (1) exerting a regulated <b>contact</b> <b>force,</b> (2) tracking {{the motion of the}} manipulandum, and (3) attaining both force and motion goals concurrently. By comparing subjects' performances in these three tasks, we found that behavior was captured by the summed actions of two independent control systems: one applying the desired force, and the other guiding the hand along the predicted path of the manipulandum. Furthermore, the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation impulses to the posterior parietal cortex selectively disrupted the control of motion but did not affect the regulation of <b>static</b> <b>contact</b> <b>force.</b> Together, {{these findings are consistent with}} the view that manipulation of objects is performed by independent brain control of hand motions and interaction forces...|$|R

These switching contacts are tested under conditions typical of MEMS relay applications; 4 V, with a <b>static</b> <b>contact</b> <b>force</b> of 1 mN, at a low current between 20 – 50 mA. The failure of the switch is identified by the evolution of contact resistance which is monitored throughout the switching cycles. The results show that the contact resistance can be stable for up to 120 million switching cycles, which are 10 (6) orders of higher than state-of-the-art pure gold contact. Bouncing behavior was also observed in each switching cycle. The failing mechanism was also studied in relation to the contact surface changes.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to present a {{three-dimensional}} mechanical model for the numerical simulation of the deep-drawing process. The model {{takes into account the}} large elastoplastic strains and rotations that occur in the deep-drawing process. Hill's orthotropic yield criteria with isotropic and kinematics hardening describes the anisotropic plastic properties of the sheet. Coulomb's classical law models the frictional contact problem treated with an augmented Lagrangian approach. This method yields a mixed system where the final unknowns of the problem are <b>static</b> (frictional <b>contact</b> <b>forces)</b> and kinematic (displacements) variables.

40|$|Much of the {{research}} on postural development has focused on changes in trunk and lower limb control. However, the hands may also play an integral role as young infants learn to stand and walk. In this study, we examine the hypothesis that with increasing walking experience infants improve their ability to use the hand adaptively for postural control. Six infants were studied longitudinally from 1 -month pre-walking to 9 -months post-walking while they stood touching a <b>static</b> <b>contact</b> surface. Touch <b>forces</b> (TF) were examined across 10 confidence ellipses each containing 10 % of the infants' postural sway. The results indicated that as infants gained walking experience they applied more TF the farther they were away from their postural center. With development, infants gain an understanding of their body position and use touch differently depending on their current position relative to their "functional boundaries. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we solve the static-equilibrium {{constrained}} inverse kinematics {{problem for a}} system made of multiple humanoid robots and manipulated objects given a set of contacts between any surfaces of the robots, any surfaces of the manipulated objects, and any surfaces of the environment. In particular, inter-robots contacts are possible. The contacts considered here are neither necessarily coplanar, nor necessarily horizontal, frictional, might be unilateral (support) or bilateral (grasp). We solve both the geometric variables (configurations) and the <b>statics</b> variables (<b>contact</b> <b>forces)</b> simultaneously within one optimization query. In the resulting configurations all the robots and the manipulated objects are in static equilibrium under the action of gravity and actuator torques that are constrained to stay within their bounds. The main focus of the paper is on the formulation of the problem rather than the optimization algorithm, as we consider the latter as a black box that only requires a mathematical model providing algorithms to compute {{the values of the}} objective function, the constraints functions, and their derivatives. We apply this work to quasistatic multi-contact legged locomotion planning on irregular terrain, multi-fingered dexterous manipulation planning, and collaborative manipulation planning. I...|$|R

Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick {{that there is no}} need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires.

Two formulations are proposed for multibody models, where computational efficiency must be kept high in order to perform speed-sweep dynamic simulations at a global system level. One formulation is based on <b>static</b> <b>contact</b> calculations, the other is simplified and only accounts for angular misalignment in the plane of action. The effects of shuttling become more important when supporting bearings {{are very close to}} each other and under the gear bodies, since the load acting on each bearing becomes more sensitive to contact load distribution on the gear teeth and to gear-tilting modes.
