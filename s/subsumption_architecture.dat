25|$|Agent {{architectures}} {{and cognitive}} architectures: Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents in a multi-agent system. A system with both symbolic and sub-symbolic components is a hybrid intelligent system, {{and the study}} of such systems is artificial intelligence systems integration. A hierarchical control system provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling. Rodney Brooks' <b>subsumption</b> <b>architecture</b> was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system.|$|E

[...] Higher levels of the RMA however, may have sophisticated mathematical world models and behavior implemented by automated planning and scheduling.

40|$|Abstract — Reactive {{agents are}} an {{important}} part of video games and numerous tools have emerged to facilitate the rapid construction of such agents. While the ability of the commonly used reactive techniques to express agent specifications is roughly equivalent, the authorial burden of constructing these specifications varies. In practice, this means that identical agent behavior may be more difficult to create in some architectures than others. In this paper we introduce the notion of representational complexity that relates to the authorial burden of constructing such agents and theoretically compare the representational complexity of finite state machines, behavior trees, and <b>subsumption</b> <b>architectures.</b> Our key finding is that hierarchical <b>subsumption</b> <b>architectures</b> have significantly lower representational complexity as compared to hierarchical finite state machines and behavior trees, which makes subsumption the best choice when developing authoring tools for non-expert users.

2500|$|<b>Subsumption</b> <b>architecture</b> is a {{methodology}} for developing artificial intelligence that is heavily associated with behavior based robotics. [...] This architecture {{is a way}} of decomposing complicated intelligent behavior into many [...] "simple" [...] behavior modules, which are in turn organized into layers. Each layer implements a particular goal of the software agent (i.e. system as a whole), and higher layers are increasingly more abstract. Each layer's goal subsumes that of the underlying layers, e.g. the decision to move forward by the eat-food layer takes into account the decision of the lowest obstacle-avoidance layer. Behavior need not be planned by a superior layer, rather behaviors may be triggered by sensory inputs and so are only active under circumstances where they might be appropriate.|$|E

50|$|The {{situated}} AI {{community has}} presented several solutions to modeling decision-making processes, {{also known as}} action selection mechanisms. The first attempt {{to solve this problem}} goes back to <b>subsumption</b> <b>architectures,</b> which were in fact more an implementation technique than an algorithm. However, this attempt paved the way to several others, in particular the free-flow hierarchies and activation networks. A comparison of the structure and performances of these two mechanisms demonstrated the advantage of using free-flow hierarchies in solving the action selection problem. However, motor schemas and process description languages are two other approaches that have been used with success for autonomous robots.|$|R
40|$|Action {{selection}} is typically a "built-in" feature of agent architectures and hence {{not subject to}} change in instantiated architectures. While often (especially in simple agents) this lack of flexibility does not matter, there are circumstances where dynamic adjustments of an action selection strategy are desirable. In this paper, we present an architecture framework, called APOC, that provides architectural mechanisms for dynamic adjustments of action selection schemes. We show how common action selection schemes (such as "winner-takes-it-all" or hierarchical schemes as used in <b>subsumption</b> <b>architectures)</b> can be implemented in APOC and, furthermore, {{how they can be}} modified dynamically. Finally, preliminary results from multi-agent simulation studies of such architectures are presented to demonstrate the utility of dynamically modifiable action selection schemes...|$|R

40|$|Introduction We are {{interested}} in the development of hybrid autonomous agents through the integration of behaviour-based <b>subsumption</b> <b>architectures</b> with the symbolic planning and reasoning capabilities of classical AI. The subsumption approach appears to offer a promising solution to the problems of interfacing high level planning algorithms with real world environments. We agree with the behaviour-based school that many low level behaviours which deal robustly with uncertainty and change can be implemented without symbolic representation, and propose to adopt a bottom up design method. However, we believe there are problems with the use of hardwired behaviours and wish to investigate neuronal group selection models as the sensorimotor basis for adaptive agent architectures. At the same time, we view the symbolic level as a powerful and necessary extension for agents intended to move beyond microdomains into complex planning and problem solving. Symbolic representation allows...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} is to perform effective single plan execution within multiple scenarios, using a modern team based first person shooter video game as the domain and visualiser. The main focus is showing that through basic machine learning mechanisms, applied in a multi-agent setting on sparse data, plans can be executed on game levels of varying size and shape without sacrificing team goals. It is also shown how different team members can perform locally sub-optimal operations which contribute to a globally better strategy by adding exploration data to the machine learning mechanisms. This contributes to the reinforcement learning problem of exploration versus exploitation, from a multi-agent perspective...|$|R

Each of these processes is designed to provide the robot with a simple competence, for example, the ability to move away from an obstacle, to move around an area in a random fashion, or to explore the robot's environment. The processes compete for control of the robot at any given time, according to a varying priority scheme which is mediated, inter alia, by external sensor input. The subsumption approach to robot control represents an interesting alternative to classical artificial intelligence techniques, but remains unproven at this time. We propose to investigate the feasibility of subsumption control for robots...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this abstract, we combine {{work from}} [Lagarde et al., 2010] and [Calinon et al., 2009] for {{learning}} and reproduction of, respectively, navigation tasks on a mobile robot and gestures with a robot arm. Both approaches build a sensory motor map under human guidance to learn the desired behavior. With several actions possible at the same time, the selection of action becomes a real issue. Several solutions exist to this problem : hierarchical architecture, parallel modules including <b>subsumption</b> <b>architectures</b> or even a mix of both [Bryson, 2000]. In navigation, a temporal sequence learner or a state-action association learner [Lagarde et al., 2010] enables to learn a sequence of directions in order to follow a trajectory.

40|$|Animals and robots perceiving {{and acting}} in a world require an {{ontology}} that accommodates entities, processes, states of a#airs, etc., in their environment. If the perceived environment includes information-processing systems, the ontology should reflect that. Scientists studying such systems need an ontology that includes the first-order ontology characterising physical phenomena, the second-order ontology characterising perceivers of physical phenomena, and a (recursive) third order ontology characterising perceivers of perceivers, including introspectors. We argue that second- and third-order ontologies refer to contents of virtual machines and examine requirements for scientific investigation of combined virtual and physical machines, such as animals and robots. We show how the CogA# architecture schema, combining reactive, deliberative, and meta-management categories, provides a first draft schematic third-order ontology for describing {{a wide range of}} natural and artificial agents.
