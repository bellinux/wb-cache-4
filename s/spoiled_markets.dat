40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{behavior}} of Dutch tropical timber investment funds in relation to financial regulation. These funds are a niche market within the market for socially responsible investments. During the past few years, several Dutch timber funds went bankrupt, whereas others were surrounded by scandals. Partly {{as a reaction to}} this, tighter regulation was developed and implemented. In response to the regulatory changes timber funds adjusted their operations and business strategy. The lack of supervision of timber funds, the subsequent tightening of the regulation and the strategic responses of the timber funds fits into the regulatory dialectic as described by Edward Kane. Moreover, we can use Akerlofs concept of informational asymmetries to explain the underlying cause of the regulatory dialectic. The key problem with the Dutch timber funds {{is that there is no}} financial supervision with respect to the liquidity and the solvency of the timber funds. Consequently, investors are unable to verify the claims made by the timber funds, which causes major information asymmetries between the two parties. Our case study demonstrates how a lack of regulation can <b>spoil</b> a <b>market</b> that in itself has the potential to offer something useful to society...|$|R

50|$|Houbraken {{claimed he}} made his {{acquaintance}} in 1674. This is somewhat hard to believe, since Diepraam died four years before that, but may explain why Houbraken had such a low opinion of him. Diepraam became a popular painter of small genre works, and sold many of these himself informally in taverns, where Houbaken clearly felt he also spent all of the proceeds on brandywine. Houbraken reports {{that by the end}} of his life he had gone out of fashion and tried selling his services as a painter with his painting box door to door, with little success. Houbraken's biggest criticism of Diepraam was not so much his lifestyle, but from what he claimed was poor brushwork. In a rare comparison to the work of Frans Hals, Houbraken claimed that Diepraam's style later in life reflected his lifestyle, and his brush strokes did not even melt together, but were loose lines without connection. Though Hals changed his style with disconnected brush strokes during his later years (this is what impressionist painters such as Vincent van Gogh admired the most about him), Houbraken claims he did this as a great master of the art, while Diepraam was just drunk. Perhaps Houbraken met some drunk claiming to be Diepraam himself, and who tried to sell Diepraam paintings after his death in 1674. This would explain why Houbraken formed his bad opinion, since like many of his contemporaries, Diepraam fell on hard times when the economic downturn <b>spoiled</b> the <b>market.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first {{reference}} to the term [...] "rough" [...] as applied to fish is in the historical work [...] "A History of Fish and Fishing on the Upper Mississippi River" [...] by Carlander. To summarize: In the mid-to-late 19th century, commercial fishermen in the Central United States often netted and processed large quantities of river fish in their boats for sale, particularly in the Mississippi River. They would then travel many miles up or down river to deliver these fish to market. In hot summer weather, the slow, heavily loaded boats often had to be lightened quickly {{to ensure that the}} entire catch did not become <b>spoiled</b> before reaching <b>market.</b> The common practice of the time was to save the fully processed fish, since these commanded a higher price at market. Rough-dressed fish (or fish sold [...] "in the rough" [...] - which means they had the internal organs removed but were not filleted) were discarded to lighten the boat, by dumping the carcasses into the river. Thus, originally a [...] "rough fish" [...] was a fish of any species that had been only partly processed and which could not be sold for full price. The term subsequently evolved into a derogatory term for any fish that was undesirable or unpopular.|$|R
40|$|Selling to the {{processing}} industry Cue: High value spice crops like vanilla and cardamom {{can be a}} tempting option for farmers wanting to earn more money. But growing these crops needs specialist knowledge and attention to detail, and farmers {{must be ready to}} invest in order to get their production started. One way {{to reduce the risk of}} failure is to have a contract with a buyer, such as a spice company, who can support in the production of the crop and be a guaranteed market. Uganda Crop Industry, for example, is a food processing company which contracts farmer groups to grow cardamom, a popular spice in Asian cooking. Ronald Kafeero is the chairman of one of these groups, and he spoke recently to Wambi Michael about how they grow and sell the spice. Before visiting Ronald, however, Wambi first met with Abdul Majidu, an extension worker with {{the processing}} company. He asked Abdul how many farmers supply their cardamom. IN:	?We have around 400 people ? OUT:	? have got that good example. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 08 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ronald Kafeero, who grows cardamom for the Uganda Crop Industry. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Majidu	We have around 400 people. The people were just very much in contact. Michael	They finally sell the product to you? Majidu	Indeed. Michael	Now let?s start our motorcycle, we go and see these guys who grow cardamom. We are now going to see some of the farmers who grow cardamom in part of this area. SFX	Motorcycle engine. Michael	We are now in Lugazi. We are meeting one of the farmers here in Lugazi Good afternoon sir. Kafeero	Good afternoon. Michael	How are you? Kafeero	I?m alright, how are you sir? Michael	Fine, how is here? Kafeero	We are ok here. Michael	Now we are talking about the growing of cardamom and I can see we are standing next to this crop. When did you begin growing cardamom? Kafeero	I began growing cardamom in 2004. We have a group which is called Kyosimbonanya. We were trained to grow cardamom so I became a model farmer here and I?m benefiting from cardamom. Michael	And how many are you in the group? Kafeero	We are 18 members. Michael	Ok, how do you market this cardamom after growing? Kafeero	After growing cardamom, after picking it from the garden, we take it straight to the Uganda Crop Industry and get our money just immediately. Michael	Immediately? Because in the past we used to have scenarios where you would grow coffee then they wait for years to get their money. So with cardamom you grow it immediately and get it? Kafeero	Yeah, and get the money. Michael	Ok. Tell us how you market this product? Kafeero	Ok. Us in our group we just gather our cardamom, all of us here, so that we send it and sell it as a group, in Uganda Crop Industry. Michael	How good is that? Kafeero	That one is better because it takes a short time, takes a little time. One person can go, a person who we trust can go there, and the rest remain working in their farms, so that we don?t waste time. Michael	Now how do you ensure the quality of cardamom that you send to Uganda Crop Industries? Kafeero	That one, we were trained by some of our instructors. The best quality of cardamom we know and we just collect it, when it is about green. Michael	Now let?s talk again about this group marketing element. How are the farmers who are growing cardamom benefiting from selling of cardamom? Kafeero	We were suffering when we were selling it, this coffee, because we were selling just individually. But now as a group, our people have benefited very much because we gather our crop at my home here and we take it there to Uganda Crop Industry. Michael	How do you share out what you have got in terms of sales? Kafeero	I have a weighing scale here. So every person who has brought his cardamom we have to know the exact kilos which we are just taking. So we gather it together, after getting the kilos of every individual, so that we send it there. Michael	And how good is this? Kafeero	That one is very good because it does not waste time and we are working together. So we are benefiting and we are advising the money which we get from there, we advise our farmers, do this one, do that one. Myself, I?m going to Kituza for more knowledge and I?ll be going to the other institute at Kampala there for more training because I have gathered enough money. Even some boda bodas, the boys are busy making money. Michael	You mean you bought motorcycles that you gave out to people? Kafeero	To people. Michael	Are you doing that also as a group, like a grouped people? Kafeero	Yes, we are doing it in Kyosimbonanya Farmers? Group, and already about ten of us we have boda bodas which are busy at the Lugazi town, who work there. Michael	In the past we had some farmers when they had the vanilla boom, people used to bring nails and whatever and they put in vanilla. So you as a group, how do you ensure quality of the cardamom? Kafeero	As we have learnt from our people with vanilla, they were spoiling their crop, whereby even there it had no market. So with us we ensure that we do something which is good so that it does not <b>spoil</b> our <b>market,</b> as it <b>spoiled</b> the <b>market</b> of those people with vanilla. We have got that good example. End of trackThe chairman of a cardamom-growing group explains the advantages of selling to a food processo...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems, Energy, Environment and Society, 2010 For the 1. 6 {{billion people}} in the world who lack access to electricity, the {{flashlight}} serves as a simple but important lighting device. In contrast to traditional incandescent flashlights, incorporating light emitting diode (LED) technology into flashlights presents a potentially less polluting, more efficient and cost-effective alternative lighting source. To avoid <b>market</b> <b>spoiling</b> as LED technology is introduced into off-grid lighting markets it is essential that quality be assured. This study addresses the quality of flashlights available to low-income flashlight users in Kenya. Lab-based performance testing of three commonly used models shows that flashlights perform substantially below rated specifications. Models tested had battery capacities that were 50 % below rated levels and required up to 25 % more time to charge the battery than advertised. Frequent users of flashlights expressed high levels of dissatisfaction with available flashlights; 87 % reported having problems with their flashlight in the last six months. Failed LEDs (23 %), water leakage (21 %), and batteries no longer keeping their charge (16 %) were among the most common problems. The median reported lifespan of a flashlight was two months. Users interviewed indicated that the cost of flashlight ownership absorbed up to 7. 4 % of their annual income. In addition, the potential health and environmental risks associated with flashlight use are substantial. Estimates indicate that more than 700, 000 kg of lead are discarded and over 30, 000 m 3 of waste are produced annually from the use of low quality flashlights in Kenya. Scenarios illustrating the impact of marketing an affordable, improved quality flashlight indicate a potential 80 % reduction of waste and lead disposal and up to a 65 % cost-savings for flashlight users. Results obtained from this study are useful for creating a framework for quality assurance of low-cost flashlights products, helping to reduce the social, economic, health and environmental implications of low-cost flashlights in Kenya and elsewhere around the world...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{emergence}} of markets for high efficiency off-grid lighting technologies holds promise, realizing the potential of this opportunity on a long-term, sustainable basis requires careful attention to issues of product quality, consumer protection, {{and the potential for}} significant 'market spoiling', in anticipation of increases of sales of low cost, low performance off-grid lighting products. The goal of the Lighting Africa quality assurance workshop was to articulate strategies to mitigate the dangers of <b>market</b> <b>spoiling</b> and to explore ways to protect consumers from misleading advertising for sales of inferior, off-grid lighting products in the context of Lighting Africa's overarching objective to support the industry in developing a robust off-grid lighting market in Africa. The workshop resulted in the identification of two strategic approaches for meeting Lighting Africa quality assurance programmatic needs. The first strategy is intended to meet a short-term programmatic need for quality associated with requests for lighting products by bulk procurement agents, such as in a World Bank-financed project. The development of procurement specifications and test procedures {{that could be used in}} a quality/usability screening method in order to provide guidance for forthcoming large volume purchases emerged as the best solution to meet this need. Such approaches are used in World Bank-financed solar home systems (SHSs) projects in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and China, among others. However, unlike the SHSs which have multiple balance-of-system (BOS) components warranting the need for an array of specifications for individual components, stand alone lighting systems require specifications that are amenable to individual light points. To test this approach, Lighting Africa elected to use the technical specifications issued by the Photovoltaic Global Approval Program for solar lanterns that use CFL bulbs (PVRS 11 A) as the basis of qualifying such products. A contract has been competitively awarded to the Global Approval Program for Photovoltaics (PV GAP) under the Lighting Africa Program to select and test ten solar lantern product models. Lantern selection will be determined based on a number of criteria, among them, the ability to provide a daily duty cycle of at least 3 hours of light, the number of days of autonomy of battery, the volume of sales (especially in Africa), and whether or not the manufacturing facility is ISO 9000 certified. Those that are confirmed as meeting the specifications may be eligible to receive a PVGAP quality seal. The work is being carried out in partnership with the Photovoltaic and Wind Quality Test Center in Beijing, China and TUV Rhineland in Koeln, Germany. As off-grid LED-based stand-alone lighting products is in a nascent stage of development compared to CFL-based lanterns, Lighting Africa will support the development of a 'Quality Screening' approach to selecting LED lighting, in order not to delay consumers benefiting from such advances. The screening methodology could be used by procurement agencies to qualify LED lighting products for bulk or programmatic procurements. The main elements of this work comprises of developing a procurement specification and test procedure for undertaking a 'quick' quality/usability screening to be used for procuring LED lights and to test up to 30 LED-based lights to screen products that meet the requirement. The second strategy is intended to meet a longer-term need associated with creating a self-sustaining product quality assurance program that will effectively protect the African consumer, prevent significant <b>market</b> <b>spoiling,</b> adapt with expected technological advancements over the long-term [...] in other words, give consumers the ability to detect quality products and the information needed to find products that meet their specific needs from among the myriad of lighting products that become available commercially. Workshop discussions and the discussions evolving from the workshop led the Lighting Africa team to opt for an approach similar to that of the 'Fair Trade' model, involving the creation of a set of voluntary criteria which companies can elect to subscribe to in order to receive a product evaluation/certification. This solution was proposed as it has the widest capacity to incorporate the largest number of recommendations from the workshop sessions. This code of conduct will be made available for companies to comment on later in 2008. These workshop proceedings provide an overview of workshop discussions and a summary of the key points identified around various workshop topic areas, contributing to the two strategy approach Lighting Africa will take as it moves forward with developing its quality assurance program...|$|R
60|$|And now as {{to gossip}} about this place. The Abyssinians are celebrated by {{travellers}} {{in their country}} as being an intelligent people. Intelligent {{is by no means}} the word, nor is sharp nor cute; they are simply the most extortionate thieves that the sun’s light ever shone on. Formerly the necessaries of life were extraordinarily cheap here. Mercher, the Tigre chief who acts as interpreter, tells me that, as an example, fowls could be purchased at forty for a dollar. I venture to say that, at the present moment, it is the dearest place in the habitable globe. I have seen three eggs offered for a dollar. This was, however, too much to be stood, and at present seven is the tariff; that is, as nearly as possible, eightpence apiece for very little eggs. An ordinary-sized fowl costs a dollar; and with great bargaining two very small and skinny ones can be obtained for that sum. Two pumpkins can be bought for a dollar: for a quart of milk a dollar is demanded, and I have seen it given. The commissariat give a dollar for about seventeen pounds of grain: if we buy it for our horses in the camp—which we are obliged to do, as there are no rations issued for our baggage-animals—we have to give a dollar for about twelve pounds. The price of a good mule before we came here was seven or eight dollars; this had risen to thirty-two or thirty-three, at which the 3d Cavalry bought a considerable number, and to thirty-seven, the average price at which Captain Griffiths, of the Transport Train, purchased a good many. General Merewether, however, by one of those masterly coups for which he is so distinguished, has suddenly raised the market price 25 per cent, by giving fifty dollars each for a lot of forty, among which were some very indifferent animals. After this, of course, fifty will be the current price, until General Merewether makes another purchase for the public service, after which there is no predicting the price at which they will probably arrive. It is all very well to say that they are cheaper here than they are in Egypt; that has, as far as I can see, nothing whatever to do with the question, any more than it would be to say they are cheaper than at the North Pole. The people were willing to sell them at thirty-seven dollars for picked animals; why, then, <b>spoil</b> the <b>market</b> by giving fifty? It is urged that we are in want of mules, and that, by offering even more than they ask, we shall induce them to send in larger quantities; but I cannot agree that it is so. We were before paying 700 per cent more than their ordinary price, and this would be sufficient temptation to owners of any mules within a hundred miles—and good mules are not common—to have brought them in. Every mule fit for the purpose would have come in, and by paying 900 per cent we can obtain no more. One source of irritation has been, I am happy to say, if not put down, at least rebuked. After the parade the other day the Commander-in-chief rode to the church, attended by most of the mounted officers. The usual demand of a dollar a-head was made, which Sir Robert very properly refused to pay, and through the interpreter said a few appropriate words to the priest as to money-changers in the temple. He refused, he said, upon that ground to allow the charge of a dollar a-head to be paid, but promised that upon his return from Magdala he would present an altar-cloth at the church.|$|R
40|$|Worldwide over 1. 3 {{billion people}} live without any access to electricity. In the world’s 50 poorest countries, almost 80 {{percent of the}} people lack access to electricity. They rely on {{firewood}} and kerosene for their energy supply, which adversely affects their environment, health and personal safety as well as hinders their opportunities for economic progress (Legros et al, 2009). The Global BrightLight Foundation was established as a not-­‐for-­‐profit entity to provide globally accessible and affordable energy solutions to improve the education, community environment, economic opportunities, and resulting quality of life of those living at the Base of the Pyramid (BoP) in emerging and third world countries that currently lack access to electricity and power. While in its early stages of operation, BrightLight required an understanding of {{the current state of the}} market, a review of current market actors, an analysis of BrightLight’s current capabilities, and a strategic analysis to position BrightLight to be successful amidst existing and future market dynamics. Research Objective and Methods. The objective of this Masters Opus was to derive a comprehensive understanding of the market for provision of small-­‐scale solar PV solutions to BoP communities, to inform strategic conversations among BrightLight’s leadership with a focus on developing a distinct business model and a detailed business plan for the non-­‐ profit to achieve their mission. A mixed methods approach for research was used to answer research questions, involving literature reviews, pilot report reviews (Rwanda and Argentinian pilot surveys on uptake of solar lanterns), and expert interviews. The project was also divided into three Phases to focus our research and deliverable set: Market Assessment, Alternative Development, and Targeted Business Plan. The Market. Four billion low-­‐income people comprise the BoP. These four billion have incomes less than $ 3, 000 in terms of local purchasing power and live in relative poverty. The BoP is characterized by significant unmet needs, dependence on informal subsistence livelihoods, and a poverty penalty. Total household income is $ 5 trillion a year, which makes the BoP a potentially important global market. The BoP market is underserved and dominated by an informal and relatively inefficient economy. The BoP market can be split into six income segments. The poorest segment earns $ 500 or less annually (less than $ 1. 50 per day). The next poorest earns between $ 500 and $ 1, 000 annually (less than $ 3. 00 per day), and so on, up to the highest segment which earns between $ 2, 500 and $ 3, 000 annually (less than $ 9. 00 per day). Spending patterns in the BoP vary by country; for example Rwanda and Djibouti spend approximately 1. 9 % and 10. 6 %, respectively, of their household income on energy. Spending on energy at the BoP is approximately 40 % urban and 60 % rural, but rural BoP households spend on average 44 % less on energy than do urban BoP households. These income and spending differences show that each region, country, and city is a unique market with different types of customer segments to serve, requiring unique marketing and distribution strategies. As of late 2012, there are approximately 1. 3 billion people without electricity access worldwide. The majority resides in Asia, but by 2030 Africa is expected to pass Asia for the largest un-­‐electrified market. The solar portable light (SPL) market is focused on off-­‐grid and under-­‐electrified markets. The SPL market is targeted predominately at consumers and small business of the BoP. The potential for off-­‐grid lighting is substantial, and market demand is growing rapidly. In addition to global population growth, there five major drivers of demand worldwide: lagging grid growth, price trends, technology and design innovation, kerosene prices, and mobile opportunities. SPLs align well with the energy needs of the BoP as a result of several factors, including rapidly declining manufacturing cost and customer payback period, rising price of kerosene, lantern quality improvements, and consumer-­‐centric design. Best Practices in the BoP. Successful organizations operating at the BoP require a different type of business sense than that of modern economies. The Michigan team conducted a literature review and spoke to current or former practitioners in the field. We learned the following lessons around operating a business or organization that serves BoP customers: • Take the long view – BrightLight must be prepared for the long haul both in terms of developing relationships with local communities and developing a sustainable business model. As our contact at the International Finance Corporation stated, “Success is still early days in terms of profitability. ” • Be prepared for a different landscape – Margins will be low, distribution channels need to be created, and consumers must be segmented across a number of different factors. This work will require partnerships, extensive on-­‐the-­‐ground research, and mutual trust with local communities. • Keep it local – BrightLight must create a local presence to build trust with end-­‐ consumers. These relationships, in turn, will inform product needs, business models, marketing strategies, and partnerships. • Create your market – BrightLight will likely have to create a market for its product. This requires teaching end-­‐users about the advantages of a product they know little to nothing about and for which the economics are different than their current energy purchases. • Embrace cooperation – Regardless of the business model it chooses, BrightLight will have to work with other organizations, including governments, non-­‐profits, and other businesses. Cooperation is a key ingredient to success. • Don’t give the lights away – The overwhelming opinion of the practitioners with whom we spoke was that giving lights away would <b>spoil</b> the <b>market.</b> BrightLight will have to create a business model to ensure that end-­‐users have skin in the game. We found that, in many respects, developing economies require business skills on steroids. Depending on the organizational and business model it chooses, BrightLight will need to do some or all of the following: determine the BoP segment it will serve, identify the right product for its customers, develop social networks based on trust to educate end-­‐users about the need for lights, leverage local connections to develop “human centered” products, maintain positive local relationships to build trust, market the product(s) to end-­‐users using a mix of traditional means (radio advertisements) and non-­‐traditional means (puppet shows, songs, etc.), partner with NGOs to build demand, and have the patience and capital to iteratively improve the model. “Best in class” organizations have built their operating procedures and business models around these principles. While success is never guaranteed, it is imperative that BrightLight follow these best practices as it builds, pilots, refines, and scales its model. Only then will BrightLight have sustainable, lasting impact. The Solar Lantern Value Chain. The solar lantern industry has grown significantly in terms of activity, sophistication, and number of involved organizations since 2006. Donor-­‐ based models comprised the majority of involved organizations in the past, but as the price of photovoltaic cells decreased and distribution channels were forged, the cost of operation dropped and market-­‐based models became increasingly viable and prevalent. In turn, the quality of products has improved, in part due to the rise of BoP-­‐centric lantern design, which the industry now considers critical to earning customer buy-­‐in. Distribution and financing remain major market barriers, and current organizations rely on in-­‐field NGO partners, microfinance banks, cooperatives, and village level entrepreneurs to help overcome them. As these hurdles are minimized in the next five to ten years, more private sector investment will flow into this industry, turning solar powered lanterns into a commodity and helping to de-­‐risk and solidify distribution and financing techniques. No single organization has achieved scale in this field, due to the highly customized nature of serving diverse BoP demographics and geographies. As a result, most successful organizations advocate replicating rather than scaling, which keeps local activities small, flexible, and customizable, but still enables transfer of key principles among satellite business groups. In other words, no single product or business model works for all BoP lantern markets. The solar lantern value chain is comprised of eight segments of activity: minerals, design, assembly, wholesale, retail, training, financing, servicing. In general, private sector companies tend to operate on the upstream end of the value chain (minerals, design, assembly, and wholesale) while both private sector and non-­‐profits tend to operate downstream (wholesale, retail, training, financing, servicing). Social enterprises operate across the entire value chain. After analyzing 47 industry players, we grouped them into 5 broad categories: Gorillas, Upstream, Downstream, Financiers, and Catalysts, described briefly below. We found that many companies were integrated across multiple categories, and many others chose a niche role within a category. • Gorillas are vertically integrated social enterprises that have proprietary operations along the value chain, but often rely on partners for certain activities. By relying less on partners overall however, Gorillas remain more adaptable than other companies to changing BoP market needs, which is a competitive advantage. • Upstream players are typically for-­‐profits or social enterprises that focus on manufacturing, assembly, and design of lanterns, and have little direct engagement in upstream activities. As the price of PV drops and the industry matures, we predict upstream players will be driven to consolidate. • Downstream players we found to be the most diverse, ranging from private-­‐sector companies or social enterprises to non-­‐profit sector NGOs. These organizations engage in varying degrees in lantern distribution, training, servicing, gathering feedback to inform better design, and occasionally financing. To succeed they rely on a dedicated in-­‐field staff and leverage their networks of partners and their knowledge of the BoP to achieve last-­‐mile distribution. • Financiers are microfinance banks, foundations, or other investors that provide working or growth capital to fund the growth of other industry players, or provide microloans for end users to purchase solar lanterns. • Catalysts are NGOs or Foundations who work at the interfaces between value chain segments to mobilize others and enable growth by removing market barriers, matching business to business, and providing supporting services and BoP market intelligence. BrightLight’s Capabilities. For BrightLight to determine its organizational model, it must first evaluate its current capabilities. This will assist the organization in understanding its strengths, assessing where its capabilities lie on the value chain, and evaluating the effort required to achieve its chosen business model. BrightLight’s current capabilities include: • Marketing • Product testing • Fundraising • The ability to convene stakeholders • Access to utility resources – funding, energy expertise, and technical & political landscape • Direct community relationships To better understand where BrightLight’s strengths lie in this sector, we mapped the organization’s current capabilities to the value chain. This analysis suggests that BrightLight’s capabilities are not directly linked to any specific segment of the value chain, such as financing or manufacturing. Rather, BrightLight’s strengths are indirectly related to the value chain, providing unique challenges and possibilities for BrightLight’s future. We also compared how much control BrightLight has over their capabilities, determined by the extent BrightLight relies on partners to execute key work, as well as the competitive advantage those capabilities offer. Though the true competitiveness of a capability will depend on a number of external factors, the competitive analysis suggests that BrightLight’s current capabilities are generally competitive and the organization has control over its most competitive features, which include its fundraising ability and influence. However, the analysis also suggests that BrightLight is dependent on its current partnerships for many of its capabilities. One thing is clear: no matter what type of organization BrightLight hopes to become, it will require additional capabilities to the ones it currently has. We view this less as a challenge and more as an opportunity. Business Model. Capitalizing on BrightLight’s current strengths, we propose a model where GBF will serve as a connector, integrator and catalyst, facilitating delivery of region-­‐ specific, service-­‐effective and cost-­‐efficient means to access solar-­‐powered energy usable on an individual, family and community scale. GBF’s strategy recognizes the systematic nature of new market development and creates a new system of value creation through providing power to the unelectrified of the world. Unlike entities that provide a single offering GBL creates a network of players that have different positions in the value network to avoid competitive conflicts and focus on providing benefits to the communities we serve. By recognizing the potential to create a value network around a new model for electrification for the poor and developing world, GBF will play a key role in fostering not only the electrification but also the economic development of those at the base of the pyramid...|$|R
