Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 micrometers. Water ice seems to be ubiquitous on the surface of Callisto, with a mass fraction of 2550%. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from the ground has revealed various non-ice materials: magnesium- and iron-bearing hydrated silicates, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, on Callisto with the Hubble Space Telescope|year=1996|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXI| url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc97/pdf/1852.PDF|page=1852|format=PDF}} and possibly ammonia and various organic compounds. <b>Spectral</b> <b>data</b> indicate that Callisto's surface is extremely heterogeneous at the small scale.

50|$|Alexis <b>Spectral</b> <b>Data</b> is a {{software}} developed for colour matching processes that calculates from available <b>spectral</b> <b>data</b> the colour numbers used by computers to display colours on screen. It displays the colour for each spectral reflectance curve and records the calculated trichromatic values and colour numbers {{along with the}} spectral curves. This eliminates the need to scan the samples separately with a Truecolour Scanner while creating the database. The <b>spectral</b> <b>data</b> can be introduced manually {{as a series of}} reflectance values at wavelengths measured in different standard illuminants with an arbitrary but fixed increment that must be kept for each spectral curve throughout the creation of the whole database. Therefore, older UV-VIS Spectrophotometers that can’t be interfaced with computers can also be used for creating the database needed for colour matching.
