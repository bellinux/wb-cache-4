25|$|Metal toothed {{watertight}} zippers rely {{on pressure}} {{between the two}} rubberized contact surfaces of the zipper tapes alongside the teeth for sealing. To get this pressure, the slider needs to press the two faces together while closing, and this increases friction between the slider and the teeth, so the zipper requires more force to close than regular zippers. If the two rows of open teeth are lined up and close together {{in front of the}} pull it will prevent misalignment which can permanently damage the <b>sealing</b> <b>edge,</b> and allow the zipper to be closed with less effort. Friction can be reduced by suitable lubrication which is usually done with a waterproof wax or grease which remains on the zipper when wet. There should not be an excessive buildup of lubricant which would stick to particles of grit and cause wear and additional friction. The plastic tooth zippers have less friction than the metal teeth and need less force to close.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{rotary shaft}} seals made of PTFE {{material}} is ever increasing in the sealing of moving machine elements {{as a consequence of}} their high thermal and chemical resistance. Primarily in the sector of pressure-loadable {{rotary shaft seals}}, there is a high development demand. High circumferential velocity and high pressure of the liquid to be sealed make the use of elastomer seals impossible. A promising alternative is presented by PTFE rotary shaft seals. The relieved rotary shaft lip seal represents a special design among PTFE rotary shaft seals. Not relying on thermal resistance of the PTFE material alone, the relieved rotary shaft seal as far as possible reduces the heat generating frictional moment for the permissible pressure range of the liquid to be sealed. Besides a high relative velocity at the <b>sealing</b> <b>edge,</b> thus, at the same time, high pressure of the liquid to be sealed is possible. Within the scope of this report, a contribution was made to the optimization of the relieved rotary shaft seal. Earlier designs of the relieved rotary shaft seal, similar to other commercially available rotary shaft seals, sometimes exhibited temporary surge-like leakages, the cause of which is the thermal expansion of the PTFE material. This was remedied by a functional analysis of the sealing system, experimental investigations, and by the use of FE simulations. In this way, the plastic memory effect, the temperature-dependent re-deformation capability of pre-deformed workpieces, proved to be a helpful measure against thermal expansion. (orig.

40|$|Rod seals {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} components of hydraulic systems. However, the fundamental physics of seal behavior is still poorly understood and the seal designers have virtually no analytical tools with which to predict the behavior of potential seal designs. In pursuit of a comprehensive physics based seal analysis/ design tool, in this work, a multi-scale multi-physics (MSMP) seal model is developed. The model solves the transient problem involving macro-scale viscoelastic deformation mechanics, macro-scale contact, micro-scale two phase fluid mechanics in the sealing zone, micro-scale asperity contact mechanics and micro-scale deformation mechanics of the <b>sealing</b> <b>edge</b> in a strongly coupled manner. The model takes into account surface roughness, mixed lubrication, cavitation and two phase flow, transient squeeze film effects and the dynamic operation as well as the effect of macro/micro/nano scale viscoelasticity. A hybrid finite element-finite volume-statistical computational framework is developed to solve the highly coupled multi-physics interactions of the MSMP model simultaneously. Surface characterization experiments are performed to extract the parameters like RMS roughness, asperity density, autocorrelation length and asperity radius needed by MSMP. To remove the high frequency noise without removing the high frequency real surface features, a wavelet transform based adaptive surface extraction method is implemented. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) is performed to extract the macro-scale viscoelastic parameters of the seal. Through atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments, the local micro/nano scale elastic moduli were found to be varying within two orders of magnitude higher than the bulk of the polymer. Significant differences in local stiffness, adhesion and the relaxation time scales of individual surface asperities were also observed. With the MSMP model, dynamic seal performance was analyzed. The results confirmed the mixed lubrication and the effect of surface roughness. Thicker fluid films during instroke and cavitation during the outstroke were found to be important for non-leakage. Seal behavior was a function of the complex dual dependence on the time varying sealed pressure and hydrodynamic effects. Viscoelasticity is seen to critically affect the leakage and friction characteristics. It produces thicker fluid films and produces a significant increase in Poiseuille component of flow during instroke. Ignoring viscoelasticity leads to under-prediction of the time required to reach the zero leakage state. Several high pressure - high frequency sealing applications were analyzed. In such applications, a new phenomenon of "secondary contact" was observed. Viscoelastic creep was seen to critically affect the contact pressure and hence the friction characteristics. In high frequency applications, viscoelasticity induced significant differences in Poiseuille flow and friction force from cycle to cycle. Cycle frequency was seen to play an important role in governing visco-elastohydrodynamics and the leakage of such seals. The seals need to be designed by considering the relationship between relaxation time scales of the polymer and the cycle frequencies. Study also revealed the presence of characteristics like "critical temperature" and "critical frequency". Using the multi-physics modeling capability of MSMP framework, several novel seal designs using smart materials like piezo-ceramic embedded polymers are proposed and analyzed. The MSMP computational framework developed here has a great potential to be used as a stand-alone seal design and analysis software in academic and industrial research. Ph. D.

The flat sealing element is permanently fixed to the end plate adjacent to a first end face of same facing the fuel cell and extends toward the second end face of the end plate. At an end adjacent to the second end face, the flat sealing element is permanently loaded by a preload force in a direction from the end plate toward the sealing device.

The longitudinal seal of the sealing device projects in the area of overlapping through the flat sealing element. The end plate has a material reduced region adjacent to the flat sealing element, in which the flat sealing element is immersible during pressing against the active sealing surface.

40|$|The {{development}} of vacuum glazing represents a significant advancement {{in the area}} of low heat loss glazing systems with the potential to substantially reduce building heating and cooling loads. Vacuum glazing consists of two or more glass panes hermetically sealed together around the edge with a vacuum gap between the panes. To avoid the glass panes from collapsing and touching each other under the influence of atmospheric pressure an array of support pillars is provided between the glass panes. A high level of thermal insulation is achieved by evacuating the spaces between the glass panes to a very low pressure which greatly reduces conduction and convection within the space; therefore heat transfer through this kind of glazing is significantly lower when compared with conventional insulating glazing. However, vacuum glazing is subject to inherent stresses due to atmospheric pressure and temperature differentials which can lead to fracture of the glass panes and failure of the <b>edge</b> <b>seal.</b> A flexible <b>edge</b> <b>seal</b> has been proposed to minimise the impact of these issues. In this paper, vacuum glazing system with rigid and flexible <b>edge</b> <b>seals</b> is theoretically studied and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Vacuum glazing {{is a form}} of low-conductance {{double glazing}} using in {{internal}} vacuum between the two glass sheets to eliminate heat transport by gas conduction and convection. An array of small support pillars separates the sheets; fused solder glass forms the <b>edge</b> <b>seal.</b> Heat transfer through the glazing occurs by radiation across the vacuum gap, conduction through the support pillars, and conduction through the bonded <b>edge</b> <b>seal.</b> <b>Edge</b> conduction is problematic because it affects stresses in the edge region, leading to possible failure of the glazing; in addition, excessive heat transfer because of thermal bridging in the edge region can lower overall window thermal performance and decrease resistance to condensation.

30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the oil seal between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston rod gap, which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the oil <b>seal</b> <b>edges</b> of the piston rod bearing oil cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and oil <b>edge</b> <b>sealing,</b> the oil chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and oil seal changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|R
