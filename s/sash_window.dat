5|$|The building's western façade has {{a central}} {{entryway}} with double doors, {{topped by a}} six-light transom and flanked by engaged pilasters. Its gable, sheathed in aluminum siding, incorporates a gabled pediment and the building's perimeter {{is surrounded by a}} wide, flat frieze. The building's southern elevation has wooden windows with 12-over-12 double-hung sashes on brick window sills. Its basement level has one entrance, flanked by wooden double-hung sash windows and four casement windows. The northeastern elevation has three stained-glass windows on the main level, with three wooden eight-over-eight double-hung sash windows; a single wooden six-over-six double-hung <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> is in the gable. The building is roofed with asphalt shingles, and a brick chimney is along the slope of the northern elevation's roof line. Its northeastern elevation has five wooden 16-over-16 double-hung sash windows on the main level and four on the lower level, in addition to two wooden four-over-four sash windows.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, 1883, Gaudí {{designed}} the Santísimo Sacramento chapel for the parish church of San Félix de Alella, {{as well as}} some topographical plans for the Can Rosell de la Llena country residence in Gelida. He also received a commission to build a small annex to the Palacio de Sobrellano, for the Baron of Comillas, in the Cantabrian town of the same name. Known as El Capricho, it was commissioned by Máximo Díaz de Quijano and constructed between 1883 and 1885. Cristòfor Cascante i Colom, Gaudí's fellow student, directed the construction. In an oriental style, it has an elongated shape, on three levels and a cylindrical tower {{in the shape of a}} Persian minaret, faced completely in ceramics. The entrance is set behind four columns supporting depressed arches, with capitals decorated with birds and leaves, similar to those that can be seen at the Casa Vicens. Notable are the main lounge, with its large <b>sash</b> <b>window,</b> and the smoking room with a ceiling consisting of a false Arab-style stucco vault.|$|E
25|$|Fenestration on {{the south}} (front) facade {{consists}} of one large one-over-one double-hung <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> in a slightly projecting bay {{with a pair of}} smaller one-over-one windows at the second story. In the gable field is an even smaller attic window, set off by cream courses at the sill and lintel. A smaller one-over-one is above the main entrance. On the west side are a similar treatment as the front {{on the south}}, with a single small window on the ground floor to the north between two smaller non-projecting one-over-ones.|$|E
50|$|The {{first floor}} has paired <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> with {{segmental}} arched fanlights and expressed rendered mouldings to each bay, with the centre bay to East Street having {{two sets of}} paired <b>sash</b> <b>windows.</b> The second floor has shorter paired <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> with arched fanlights to each bay.|$|R

500|$|Built in 1818, the Gurdon Bill Store is a [...] by [...] -story clapboarded store. The {{walls extend}} higher up than the ceiling to an attic for {{additional}} storage space. The wood-shingled gable roof {{also has a}} smaller pent roof on the front facade that projects about [...] beyond the wall, which is unusual in New England architecture. The foundation of the store is built upon fieldstone and has stone blocks above the ground; the store has a full cellar. The main facade has two large twelve-by-twelve light sliding sash windows {{on the left side}} that can be covered with three-part batten shutters. The main door is a Dutch door with a plain frame and to its right is a smaller six-by-six <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> without a batten shutter. The rear facade is plain and devoid of any windows. The north end of has four windows, two for the attic, and the south end has only two windows for the attic, all with six-over-six sash.|$|E
500|$|In March 1809 {{a miracle}} was {{reported}} as occurring at the convent. It is recorded {{that one of}} the nuns, Sister Mary Ann Wood, sustained a deep cut across her arm while opening a <b>sash</b> <b>window.</b> She was attended by a local surgeon, who judged that the muscles, and most of the tendons had been severed. The wound healed over after three weeks, but she continued to suffer sharp pain for four months. During all this time, she was not able to use her hand or arm, and despite attempting a variety of different methods to repair the broken tendons, the doctor eventually declared that she may regain use of her forefinger and thumb, but not the rest of her fingers. By this time, her arm and hand had withered, and Sister Mary Ann decided to make a novena (nine prayers) to Saint Winifred. She began her prayers on 6 August, and placed a piece of moss on her arm; she said that she felt intense pain, and considered removing the moss, but opted not to. The following morning, she awoke, and her hand and arm were returned to full strength. The surgeon who had been tending to her was said to have [...] "at first declared the case a miracle; but human respect prevented him from publicly attesting it." [...] The Right Reverend Peter Collingridge, Vicar Apostolic of the Western District, after consulting a Catholic surgeon in London, declared [...] "that the cure was supernatural and an evident miracle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Behind {{the pillars}} {{is the main}} entrance, framed by pilasters {{supporting}} a full entablature with another stained glass window above. On either side the double doors have a fluted Ionic column {{in front of a}} small window.Paneled corner pilasters support the gabled roof and its cornice, with a full entablature. Both north and south profiles are fenestrated with four [...] stained glass windows, with an additional smaller one on the north. The rear has cornice returns and a single double-hung <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> in the gable. A brick chimney rises from {{the south side of the}} roof.|$|E
50|$|Dutch Colonial Revival {{style of}} the early 1900s is also prominent. The pictured house {{features}} a shingled gambrel roof with 6 by 6 paneled <b>sash</b> <b>windows.</b> On the first floor is a pediment entryway and 8 by 8 paneled <b>sash</b> <b>windows,</b> surrounded with shutters.|$|R
50|$|Response to the {{new school}} was good and in 1903 the {{building}} was extended eastwards to include a reading room and office. The new section incorporated rectilinear <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> instead of the round-headed <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> of the original building and a new hip roof form.|$|R
50|$|Double-hung <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> were {{traditionally}} often {{fitted with}} shutters. <b>Sash</b> <b>windows</b> can be fitted with simplex hinges that let the window be locked into hinges on one side, while the rope {{on the other}} side is detached—so the window can be opened for fire escape or cleaning.|$|R
2500|$|The chapel is Neoclassical {{in style}} and has a {{rendered}} exterior which has now been painted over. [...] The walls underneath are brick. [...] The two-storey building has three bays, each with a <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> (described by Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner as [...] "oddly debased"). [...] A wide string course divides {{the upper and lower}} floors. [...] The entrance porch is flanked by pilasters and has a cornice and parapet with a tympanum. [...] Below the roofline, a set of three sash windows are topped with slightly recessed arches which extend above the level of the cornice; the centre arch is higher. [...] Above these is a pediment with a circular recess surrounded by four keystones. [...] At the rear (facing Tackleway), some of the original red-brick wall remains, although it has been altered. [...] There are some yellow brick dressings, three arched windows and another pediment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} {{is one of}} the oldest surviving houses in Brighton, and has been called [...] "one of [...] most famous surviving early buildings". Its modest appearance and small size prompted architectural historian Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel, a former resident of Brighton, to call it [...] "as charming a relic of ... Brighthelmstone [...] as anyone could wish to see". It is a three-storey building with a modern shopfront on the lowest floor, two storeys in residential use above, and a large hipped roof with dormer windows. The top two floors are laid with black glazed mathematical tiles—often used in the 18th and 19th centuries on buildings in Brighton, and a characteristic feature of the local architecture. The second and third storeys also have canted bay windows; to the sides and rear (facing an ancient alleyway), original sash windows remain. The left dormer window is a casement, while the right has a <b>sash</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The 17 {{houses of}} the west side form a long, {{straight}} terrace of five storeys. [...] Under their stucco façades is brick, rubble and bungaroosh—a composite building material commonly found behind stucco in 18th- and 19th-century buildings in Brighton and Hove. [...] Each house has three windows to each storey (either blocked or containing a <b>sash</b> <b>window,</b> and pilasters and quoins between some of the neighbouring buildings mark the terrace out into a symmetrical five-part composition which {{has been described as}} either 2–4–5–4–2 or 2–5–3–5–2. [...] The top storey {{is in the form of}} an attic, and the treatment of the windows is different: they are on a moulded cornice, and some are arched. [...] On the floor below, the windows are surrounded by Vitruvian scroll patterns, and at the storey below that they are flanked by pilasters which hold up an entablature and small pediment. [...] A cast iron balcony surrounds the first-floor bay windows and is supported by the top of the Doric-columned entrance porch, which has a stuccoed balustrade. [...] According to one writer, [...] "the heavy emphasis of [...] porches give the square an air of respectable solidity"—as do the heavy doors with their recessed panels, moulded ornamentation and decorative fanlights. [...] Original interior fittings include a large [...] "Jacobean-cum-Baroque" [...] chimneypiece in the hall of number 32.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{problems}} with solid wooden <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> include rot, swelling or {{distortion of the}} woodwork or rattling in the wind (due to shrinkage of the wood). These problems can be solved by careful repair {{and the introduction of}} draught stripping. It is also a common problem for inexperienced painters (or experienced painters without any sash-painting experience) to paint the sash stuck. The sliding mechanism makes <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> more vulnerable to these problems than traditional casement <b>windows.</b> <b>Sash</b> <b>windows</b> are relatively high maintenance, but offer advantages in return (style, aesthetics, abides by laws (relating to older houses and buildings), natural resources etc.). However, well-maintained <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> should last generations without needing parts replaced. It is also possible to clean all the glass from within the building by sliding the two panes to different positions.|$|R

2500|$|Another of Pearce's {{earliest}} commissions {{occurred when}} he was commissioned by his uncle-in-law Thomas Coote to build Bellamont House, at Cootehill, County Cavan. This family connection was not unusual. other of Pearce's clients were related to him. Like Castletown, Bellamont claims to be Ireland's first Palladian house. [...] Dates attributed to the design range from 1725–1730, whatever the date (1725 is probable) it is almost certain {{that this was the}} first of Ireland's many palladian houses to be completed. [...] The four bays square modestly sized mansion is clearly inspired by Palladio's Villa Capra. [...] The principal facade has as its ground floor a rusticated semi-basement, above which is the piano nobile at the centre is a four columned portico with a pediment, the portico is flanked by a single high <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> on each side. [...] The main entrance beneath the one story portico is reached by a single flight of broad steps. [...] Above the piano nobile is a secondary floor with windows exactly half the size of those below. [...] The entire facade is just four windows wide. [...] The composition is a hybrid between the grandest of the Veneto's villas and a slightly exalted farmhouse, which ironically was the very intention of Palladio's original designs 200 years previously. [...] While Castletown is a symbol or wealth and power, the far smaller Bellamont is the greater symbol of palladianism and architectural perfection. [...] Also during this period of his work Pearce redesigned the south elevation of Drumcondra House (now All Hallows College, Dublin).|$|E
60|$|Nancy stooped {{below the}} shutters, and Oliver {{heard the sound}} of a bell. They crossed to the {{opposite}} side of the street, and stood for a few moments under a lamp. A noise, as if a <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> were gently raised, was heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened. Mr. Sikes then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony; and all three were quickly inside the house.|$|E

60|$|My memory {{takes me}} {{back across the}} {{interval}} of fifty years to a little ill-lit room with a <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> open to a starry sky, and instantly there returns to me the characteristic smell of that room, the penetrating odor of an ill-trimmed lamp, burning cheap paraffin. Lighting by electricity had then been perfected for fifteen years, but still the larger portion of the world used these lamps. All this first scene will go, in my mind at least, to that olfactory accompaniment. That was the evening smell of the room. By day it had a more subtle aroma, a closeness, a peculiar sort of faint pungency that I associate--I know not why--with dust.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{very small}} grate, made of {{cast-iron}} in one piece and painted buff, and a still smaller misfit of a cast-iron fender that confessed the gray stone of the hearth. No fire was laid, only a few scraps of torn paper and {{the bowl of a}} broken corn-cob pipe were visible behind the bars, and in the corner and rather thrust away was an angular japanned coal-box with a damaged hinge. It was the custom in those days to warm every room separately from a separate fireplace, more prolific of dirt than heat, and the rickety <b>sash</b> <b>window,</b> the small chimney, and the loose-fitting door were expected to organize the ventilation of the room among themselves without any further direction.|$|E
60|$|This {{the young}} fellow was so overjoyed with, {{that he could}} not {{restrain}} himself. It lay all within his reach he said, and he swore violently to me that he would have it, if he broke down the house for it. I dissuaded him a little, but saw there was no remedy; so he ran rashly upon it, slipped out a square of the <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> dexterously enough, and without noise, and got out four pieces of the silks, and came with them towards me, but was immediately pursued with a terrible clutter and noise. We were standing together indeed, but I had not taken any of the goods out of his hand, when I said to him hastily, 'You are undone, fly, for God's sake!' He ran like lightning, and I too, but the pursuit was hotter after him because he had the goods, than after me. He dropped two of the pieces, which stopped them a little, but the crowd increased and pursued us both. They took him soon after with the other two pieces upon him, and then the rest followed me. I ran for it and got into my governess's house whither some quick-eyed people followed me to warmly as to fix me there. They did not immediately knock, at the door, by which I got time to throw off my disguise and dress me in my own clothes; besides, when they came there, my governess, who had her tale ready, kept her door shut, and called out to them and told them there was no man come in there. The people affirmed there did a man come in there, and swore they would break open the door.|$|E
