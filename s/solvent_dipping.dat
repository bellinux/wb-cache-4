40|$|The surface {{chemistry}} of aquatic organisms determines their biotic interactions. Metabolites in the spatially limited {{laminar boundary layer}} mediate processes, such as antifouling, allelopathy and chemical defense against herbivores. However, very few methods are available for the investigation of such surface metabolites. An approach is described in which surfaces are extracted by means of C 18 solid phase material. By powdering wet algal surfaces with this material, organic compounds are adsorbed and can be easily recovered for subsequent liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) investigations. The method is robust, picks up metabolites of a broad polarity range and is easy to handle. It is more universal compared to established <b>solvent</b> <b>dipping</b> protocols {{and it does not}} cause damage to the test organisms. A protocol is introduced for the macroalgae Fucus vesiculosus, Caulerpa taxifolia and Gracilaria vermiculophylla, but it can be easily transferred to other aquatic organisms...|$|E
40|$|Materiais superhidrofóbicos vêm sendo cada vez mais utilizados devido às inúmeras propriedades que acarretam na superfície, como de serem auto-limpantes, anti-corrosivos, anti-aderentes, dentre outras. Muitos pesquisadores vêm tentando modificar as superfícies poliméricas para obter tal estado de molhabilidade devido ao seu grande uso em diversas indústrias. O polipropileno (PP) e o polietileno (PE) são polímeros {{commodities}} com um elevado nível de produção onde muitas aplicações podem ser beneficiadas através do uso de superfícies superhidrofóbicas. Alguns produtos específicos podem se tornar disponíveis comercialmente após modificações superficiais. O objetivo deste trabalho foi modificar a superfície do PP e do PE através da aplicação de um recobrimento com nanopartículas (NPs) de dióxido de titânio (TiO 2) funcionalizadas com compostos de organosilano para a obtenção de polímeros superhidrofóbicos. A metodologia se baseia através do método de imersão em uma única etapa, onde variações nos parâmetros experimentais, como o solvente da suspensão, o tempo de imersão, a concentração de NPs de TiO 2 e a temperatura de imersão, permitiram o controle das propriedades superhidrofóbicas da superfície as quais foram analisadas e caracterizadas através das técnicas de WCA, MEV, FTIR-ATR, XPS, DRX e perfilometria óptica. Após a aplicação do recobrimento, superfícies com WCA≥ 150 º foram facilmente obtidas pela imersão do substrato polimérico por poucos segundos em suspensões aquecidas com xileno. Propriedades superhidrofóbicas estática e dinâmica foram controladas com a dependência da concentração de -OH na superfície, onde concentrações maiores que 25 % levam à superfícies superhidrofóbicas estáticas perdendo suas propriedades de auto-limpeza. Objetivando aumentar a adesão entre o substrato de PP e o recobrimento aplicado, tratamento com radiação ultravioleta (UV) foi utilizado para conferir ligações covalentes entre o nanorecobrimento aplicado e o substrato polimérico que até então eram inexistentes. Foi observado um aumento de mais de 80 % na adesão para a superfície tratada por 1 h com radiação UV quando comparada com a superfície sem tratamento. Entretanto, após o tratamento com UV as superfícies perdiam suas características superhidrofóbicas. Ao se alternar ciclos de irradiação com UV e tratamento térmico, superfícies inteligentes de PP com nanorecobrimento são produzidas e a reversibilidade entre superhidrofilicidade e superhidrofobicidade pode ser facilmente controlada. Após três ciclos de tratamento, as superfícies atingiram os extremos de WCA, variando de 0 º à 155 º com tratamento fotoquímico e térmico, respectivamente. A metodologia desenvolvida para o preparo de superfícies superhidrofóbicas de PP e PE é simples e de baixo custo para expandir o processo. Superhydrophobic {{materials are}} being increasingly used {{due to the}} many properties that cause on the surface, such as to be self-cleaning, anti-corrosive, anti-adherents, among others. Many research groups {{have been trying to}} modify polymer surfaces to obtain such state of wettability due to its potential uses in several industries. Polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) are commodities polymers with a very high production levels where many applications will benefit from non-wetting surfaces. Some specific products may have the potential to become commercially available after such surface modifications. The aim {{of this study was to}} modify the surface of PP and PE by coating with titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanoparticles (NPs) functionalized with organosilanes compounds to obtain superhydrophobic polymers. The methodology is based in one-step dipping method, where the changes in the experimental parameters, such as suspension <b>solvent,</b> <b>dipping</b> time, TiO 2 NPs concentration and dipping temperature allows the control of the superhydrophobic properties. The polymers surfaces were analyzed and characterized by WCA, SEM, FTIR-ATR, XPS, XRD and optical profilometry techniques. After the coatings, surfaces with WCA ≥ 150 º were easily obtained by dipping the substrates for a few seconds in hot xylene suspensions. Static and dynamic superhydrophobic properties were controlled depending on the -OH surface concentration, where concentrations higher that 25 % led to static superhydrophobic surfaces losing the self-cleaning properties. Aiming to increase the adhesion between the PP substrate and the applied coating, ultraviolet (UV) treatment was carried out to induce covalent bonds between the nanocoating and the substrate that were previously inexistent. An increase of more than 80 % in the adhesion of the coating was observed for the PP substrates treated for 1 h with UV radiation when compared with untreated surface. However, after UV treatment, the surfaces lose their superhydrophobic characteristics. By switching between UV light illumination and soft thermal treatment, smart PP nanocomposite surfaces were produced, where the reversibility between superhydrophylicity and superhydrophobicity can be easily controled. After three cycles of photochemical-thermal treatments, surfaces reached the extremes of wettability achieving WCA of 0 º and 155 º by UV and thermal treatments respectively. The methodology used to prepare PP and PE superhydrophobic surfaces is simple and represents a potential low cost method for scale up the process...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{class of}} telechelic α-alkyl ω-trimethoxysilane poly(N-propionylethylene imine) s (TMS-PPEIs) has been {{synthesized}} by living cationic ring-opening polymerization of 2 -oxazolines. A new route for the termination {{reaction of the}} living polyoxazoline is dcscribed. These block copolymers have been tested as coatings for glass fibres. The polymers were applied {{by means of a}} <b>solvent</b> <b>dip</b> test. It is supposed that the affinity of the polyoxazoline block for glass surfaces promotes the reaction of the silane with the silanol groups of the glass substrate. Because of the presence of the apolar α-block, the surface tension of the glass surface will be lowered, as was shown by contact angle measurements. The presence of the polymer on the glass surface was also demonstrated by XPS measurements. The interfacial properties of coated glass plates and polymer matrices were determined by performing lap-shear tests. ...|$|R

We study the dipping duration, one of {{the parameters of the}} dipping deposition related to the characterization of AA-PSP. The dipping duration was varied from 1 to 100, 000 s. The properties characterized are the pressure sensitivity, temperature dependency, and signal level. The maximum pressure sensitivity of 65 % is obtained at the dipping duration of 100 s, the minimum temperature dependency is obtained at the duration of 1 s, and the maximum signal level is obtained at the duration of 1, 000 s, respectively. Among the characteristics, the dipping duration most influences the signal level. The change in the signal level is a factor of 8. 4. By introducing a weight coefficient, an optimum dipping duration can be determined. Among all the dipping parameters, such as the <b>dipping</b> duration, <b>dipping</b> <b>solvent,</b> and luminophore concentration, the pressure sensitivity and signal level are most influenced by the <b>dipping</b> <b>solvent...</b>|$|R
30|$|Two simple methods (<b>solvent</b> {{evaporation}} and <b>dip</b> coating) for immobilizing titania into pumice {{had been}} studied and optimized. Based on sol stability and mechanical strength tests, {{it can be}} concluded that acid condition would be favourable for immobilizing titania unto pumice. In addition, it was found that for certain immobilization method there is a suitable dispersion medium that should be chosen accordingly: ethanol for solvent evaporation method, while aquadest for dip coating method. Both methods successfully produced not only sol with high level of stability, but also mechanically strong immobilized titania on pumice.|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{fabrication}} and characterization of fully organometallic multilayer thin films, composed of poly(ferrocenylsilane) polyanions and polycations. These polyions were deposited electrostatically onto a variety of substrates including quartz, silicon, gold, and hydrophilic/hydrophobically patterned substrates, using layer-by-layer self-assembly. The deposition process was monitored by means of UV/visible absorption spectroscopy, showing a linear increase in absorption {{with the number of}} bilayers. Ellipsometry was used to measure the development of film thickness with the number of bilayers, revealing a linear relationship and a thickness contribution of approximately 0. 4 nm/bilayer. The multilayer films were further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and by cyclic voltammetry. By integration of the voltammetric signals, the surface concentration of the redox-active ferrocene units was obtained {{as a function of the}} number of poly(ferrocenylsilane) bilayers. Selective adsorption of the polyions was achieved onto the hydrophobic stripes of a pattern of CH 3 - and OH-terminated alkanethiol monolayers on gold, forming patterned organometallic multilayer structures. This selective deposition was explained by taking hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions into account. The hydrophobic backbone of the poly(ferrocenylsilane) polyions has favorable hydrophobic interactions with the methyl-terminated areas of the patterned substrate but not with hydroxyl-terminated domains, which are hydrogen-bonded with the <b>solvent.</b> The <b>dipping</b> sequence does not influence the selectivity of the multilayer deposition...|$|R
40|$|The Ion Layer Gas Reaction ILGAR {{technique}} {{has been developed}} for the deposition of chalcogenide thin films. It is a cyclic and sequential, chemical, low cost deposition method. In a first step a solid precursor layer is applied on a substrate by dipping into a solution of a metal salt dissolved in a volatile <b>solvent</b> <b>Dip</b> ILGAR. For the deposition of thicker layers a set up has been developed, where the precursor layer is sprayed onto the substrate Spray ILGAR. By fumigating the solid presursor film with a hydrogen chalcogenide the sample is converted to the corresponding metal chalcogenide. These process steps are repeated until the desired layer thickness is obtained. The ILGAR deposition method is able to prepare homogeneous films on flat substrates {{as well as on}} substrates of any shape and even a deposition inside a hollow body is possible. The reaction at the solid gas interface allows a homogeneous deposition also on rough and porous substrates even along the inner surface. The low temperature process of the ILGAR deposition makes it also suitable for the preparation of thin layers on plastic substrates or foils. In principal all metal chalcogenides can be prepared by using the respective metal salt and hydrogen chalcogenide, respectively. Until now, a lot of experience was acquired in depositing sulfidic and oxidic layers using hydrogen sulfide and a gaseous mixture of hydrogen oxide water and ammonia, respectively. From transparent conductive oxides ITO, FTO, semiconductors In 2 S 3, CdS, ZnS, ZnO, as well as insulating ceramics Al 2 O 3 up to multinary compounds CuInS 2 a series of materials have been already prepared. The ILGAR layers are already applied as protective layers against corrosion, charging or scratching. Moreover, the conventional used CdS buffer usually deposited in a chemical bath in chalcopyrite based thin film solar cells is replaced by ILGAR layers. Resulting devices yield comparable or even superior power conversion efficiencies than the standard CdS buffered solar cells. In addition, ILGAR layers can be used for the fixation of colloids, which extends the functionality of the films even more. One example is e. g., an ILGAR film with embedded fluorescing colloids, which is applied on photovoltaic devices in order to increase the quantum efficiency of solar cells in the blue wavelength region. In this article we will focus on the mechanism of the Dip and Spray ILGAR including some thermodynamic considerations. It will be demonstrated that the properties of the prepared layers can be directly tuned by the process parameters and we will shed light on the ILGAR growth mechanism. Finally, the properties of the films prepared by ILGAR will be correlated with their suitability for certain applications...|$|R
30|$|On the contrary, Fig.  6 e, f {{describes}} how the TiNT catalyst has covered all the outer surface of pumice {{as the product of}} dip coating method. It has been reported that dip coating method can produce a thin and controllable layer on the support [36]. Unlike <b>solvent</b> evaporation method, <b>dip</b> coating method was conducted on relatively low temperature. In this condition, the molecules of aquadest would just slightly move in the system, making the interaction between TiNT and pumice occurred mostly on the outer surface of pumice. Therefore, most titania particles were immobilized on the external part of pumice. One benefit to be noticed is dip coating method could produce very homogen layer of catalyst on the surface of support, which would favor the mechanical strength of immobilized titania.|$|R
30|$|Simple {{methods for}} immobilizing titania into pumice were applied, where the {{products}} {{had been used}} {{for the application of}} photodegrading phenol waste. There were two simple methods, which were used separately: <b>solvent</b> evaporation and <b>dip</b> coating. Based on titania sol stability test, it was observed that acid condition would be favourable for immobilizing titania unto pumice, and preferable dispersion medium for solvent evaporation method was ethanol, while dip coating method was better to use aquadest (water). Prepared samples were characterized by FE-SEM, EDX, XRD, and BET analysis. Mechanical strength and photodegradation tests were conducted to observe the quality and ability of immobilized photocatalyst. Experimental results show that both methods had produced mechanically strong immobilized titania, where dip coating method tended to produce homogen solid film of titania on the outer surface of pumice, while solvent evaporation method could deliver titania deeper unto the inner part of the pumice. Catalyst detachment level of immobilized titania nanotube by dip coating method was 4.6 %, while the one of the products of solvent evaporation method was 5.0 %. Furthermore, in terms of photocatalytic activity, product of dip coating method gave slightly better performance (with 28 % of phenol elimination after 240  min) than the product of solvent evaporation method (24 %), due to shading effect, mostly occurring to immobilized catalyst in the inner part of the pumice.|$|R
40|$|Here we report, a novel two-step dipping {{technique}} via post-immersion {{polar solvent}} engineering for controlled secondary grain growth (Ostwald Ripening) to fabricate efficient mixed organic cation based MA 0. 6 FA 0. 4 PbI 3 perovskite solar cell (PSC) {{in conjunction with}} low temperature (140 °C) processed sol-gel ZnO ETL for full process compatibility with flexible substrates. The reported MTD-SE method (stands for Modified Two Step <b>Dipping</b> - <b>Solvent</b> Engineering) limits the grain coarsening effect during post-immersion stage of two-step dipping method and provides substantially smooth perovskite surface morphology for enhanced charge transport properties compared to conventional two-step techniques by means of controlled Ostwald Ripening process. The grain coarsening process and concomitant irregular grain size distribution are judiciously controlled by increasing the chemical potential or free energy change (ΔG) of the system at the post-immersion. The photovoltaic performance and photo-current hysteresis phenomena of the reported MTD-SE PSC have been compared with PSCs fabricated with conventional two-step techniques, incorporating 2 -Propanol or ethyl alcohol as <b>dipping</b> <b>solvents.</b> The enhanced device performance of MTD-SE PSCs is correlated with the conducive role of the evenly distributed grain boundaries in them, which act as carrier dissociation interfaces and carrier transport pathways to charge selective contacts for superior charge separation and extraction properties.
