These virulent <b>strains</b> typically cause a bout of diarrhea that is often self-limiting in healthy adults but is frequently lethal to children in the developing world.

40|$|International audienceThe jerky flow of Al-Mg alloys is {{investigated}} during tensile {{tests at}} imposed <b>strain</b> rate and room temperature. The <b>strain</b> and <b>strain</b> rate dependences {{of the magnitude}} of the stress drops, the range of plastic instability and the critical <b>strain</b> for the onset of serrations are studied in connection with the Mg content. In the low <b>strain</b> rate part of the <b>strain</b> rate range of instability, the critical <b>strain</b> decreases with the Mg content. The critical <b>strain</b> rate corresponding to the minimum of the critical <b>strain</b> vs. applied <b>strain</b> rate curve shifts to larger values when the Mg content increases. This behavior leads to an enlargement of the <b>strain</b> rate domain of inverse behavior of the critical <b>strain,</b> {{at the expense of the}} domain of normal behavior. In the high <b>strain</b> rate part of the range of instability, the critical <b>strain</b> does not depend on the Mg content.

40|$|Indentation {{is widely}} used to {{investigate}} the elastic and plastic properties of mechanical materials, which includes the <b>strain</b> rate sensitivity. The indentation exhibits an inhomogeneous <b>strain</b> distribution in contrast to compression and tensile tests with homogeneous deformation. Thus, the <b>strain</b> rate of the indentation may form the inhomogeneous distribution. Therefore, the effect of <b>strain</b> rate distribution of the indentation on pure aluminum {{with respect to the}} <b>strain</b> rate dependence of strength in order to clarify the effect of the <b>strain</b> rate on the indentation technique. First, the numerical simulation was established using the Cowper-Symonds equation as the dynamic constitutive equation. Secondary, the <b>strain</b> rate distribution was calculated from the equivalent plastic <b>strain</b> distribution. The <b>strain</b> rate distribution was quite different from the <b>strain</b> distribution, which showed that the <b>strain</b> rate at the crater rim was higher than that beneath the indenter. Finally, we try to perform the averaging of <b>strain</b> rate distribution in order to make an index of <b>strain</b> rate in the indentation. The average of <b>strain</b> rate distribution was calculated using the equivalent plastic <b>strain</b> above a boundary value that is the critical <b>strain</b> and the representative <b>strain.</b> There is correlation between the average <b>strain</b> rate and the loading curvature, which shows that the average <b>strain</b> rate can express as the representative of <b>strain</b> rate for the indentation technique...|$|R

40|$|Myocardial <b>strain</b> is {{a measure}} of tissue {{deformation}} and <b>strain</b> rate is the rate at which deformation occurs. When applied to the heart, <b>strain</b> and <b>strain</b> rate give fundamental information on myocardial properties and mechanics that would otherwise be unavailable. Site specificity and angle independency are two unique characteristics of <b>strain</b> and <b>strain</b> rate data. <b>Strain</b> and <b>strain</b> rate can be obtained with tissue Doppler imaging or with 2 D speck tracking. These two techniques derive information on <b>strain</b> and <b>strain</b> rate in two fundamentally different ways and each has its own advantages and limitations. Tissue Doppler imaging yields velocity information from which <b>strain</b> and <b>strain</b> rate are mathematically derived whereas 2 D speckle tracking yields <b>strain</b> information from which <b>strain</b> rate and velocity data are derived. Data obtained from these two different techniques may not be equivalent due to limitations inherent with each technique. <b>Strain</b> and <b>strain</b> rate imaging have been used to assess myocardial function {{in a wide range of}} cardiac conditions. They are useful in detecting early left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in the setting of systemic diseases with cardiac involvement, in differentiating transmural from non-transmural infarction, and in identifying LV contractile reserve in regurgitant valve lesions. When used with dobutamine echocardiography, <b>strain</b> and <b>strain</b> rate imaging can identify viable myocardium and aid the detection of myocardial ischaemia. <b>Strain</b> and <b>strain</b> rate imaging can also be used to assess right ventricular and left atrial function. Despite significant promises, <b>strain</b> and <b>strain</b> rate imaging is technically challenging and signal to noise ratio may be potentially affected by a wide range of factors. As a result, <b>strain</b> and <b>strain</b> rate imaging have been slow to get incorporated into everyday clinical practice. Ongoing research and further technical development are likely to improve the quality of the data and the more general acceptance of these new modalities of imaging in echocardiography...|$|R
