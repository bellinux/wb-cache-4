Lamiaceae The frequencies of females, hermaphrodites and partially male-sterile (PMS) genets of Glechoma hederacea were estimated in natural populations in <b>S</b> <b>Sweden.</b> The frequency of females and PMS genets in natural populations varied from 0 to 100 %. The {{temporal and spatial}} variation in stamen fertility in PMS genets was studied {{in the field and}} in cultivation. Hermaphrodite flowers were self-compatible, seed production was found to be pollen limited and the clonal structure of the species usually caused a reduction in seed set in females. Hermaphrodite and PMS clones were usually larger than female clones and more heterozygous. Disomic inheritance of duplicated loci was found in this tetraploid species, and segregation ratios for allozymes conformed to Mendelian expectation. Allozymes were used to establish multilocus genotypes in seven populations in <b>S</b> <b>Sweden</b> and three populations in the S Czech Republic. Clonal diversity in an area of c. 100 m 2 was greatest in an ephemeral population (PD i. e. proportion of distinguished genets = 0. 98) and lowest in more stable habitats (PD = 0. 01).

40|$|While the U. <b>S.</b> and <b>Sweden</b> both {{lost more}} than 20 per cent of their shares of world and {{developed}} countries' exports of manufactures over the 15 years or so after the mid- 1960 's, the export shares of their multinational firms stayed fairly stable or even increased. The multinationals, while first increasing and then holding fairly constant their shares of exports by their home countries, raised the proportion of their worldwide exports that they supplied from their overseas affiliates. These developments suggest that the declining trade shares of the U. <b>S.</b> and <b>Sweden</b> were not due mainly to deterioration in the innovativeness or inventiveness of American and Swedish firms or declines in their management ability or in their technological capabilities, but rather to economic developments in the firms' home countries. The finding that firms have done better as exporters than their home countries 4 s strengthened {{when we look at}} different industry groups. In both the U. <b>S.</b> and <b>Sweden,</b> and in all industry groups, with one exception, the multinationals' export shares increased relative to those of their home countries. The margins were often wide, and were mostly larger for Swedish firms than for U. S. firms. In general, though the basic story was quite similar for the U. <b>S.</b> and <b>Sweden,</b> there were some notable differences. One was that the share of exports originating in affiliates was lower for Sweden than for the U. S. To a large extent, this difference in the siting of export production reflected the much greater export orientation of Swedish parents relative to U. S. parents, presumably a consequence of the relatively small size of the Swedish domestic market. Another difference between U. S. and Swedish multinationals was that while the U. S. firms' share in world manufacturing exports remained stable over the studied period, the Swedish firms' share rose by 14 per cent. We are so far {{not in a position to}} say whether this was because Swedish firms increased their competitiveness more than U. S. firms or because there was a higher conversion of Swedish firms into multinational status. ...|$|R

During the 1950 <b>s,</b> <b>Swedens</b> musical avantgarde {{was mainly}} lead by the concert {{organisation}} Fylkingen. Some {{of the leading}} members used {{to belong to the}} Mondaygroup in the 1940 s and brought a will to update and modernise Swedish music with them into Fylkingen. This resulted in a radical change in the concert programs of Fylkingen and a development that lead to the introduction of the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen in Sweden. The summercourses in Darmstadt became very important to Fylkingen, especially through Bengt Hambraeus' close relationship with the European avantgarde. The aim of this essay is to discuss what kind of influence, if any, Karlheinz Stockhausen had on the Swedish music.   If Stockhausen influenced the musical development in Darmstadt during the 1950 s and Fylkingen was influenced by Darmstadt, one must ask: How did Stockhausen influence Swedish music? My conclusion is that Fylkingen used Stockhausen as a symbol and an argument for the European avant-garde music in their goal to convince their critics that the new music was of great importance for Sweden's future {{as a part of the}} international musical scene. ...|$|R
30|$|Coordination {{based on}} trendsetting is {{of a more}} recent vintage in Scandinavia.

During the following years he wrote extensively on the issue of economic planning.

His focus gradually shifted from central planning during the war, toward framework planning and indicative planning after the war, when he designed the first Swedish long-term survey...|$|E
40|$|Some {{phytoplankton}} {{have the}} ability to combine phototrophy and heterotrophy within the same individual, which is called mixotrophy. In this thesis, I adress mixotrophy and competitive interactions of mixotrophs and obligate auto- or heterotrophs in relation to the availability of nutrients, light and prey. In addition, I examine the biomass of mixotrophic phytoplankton and their grazing impact on bacteria in oligotrophic clear-water lakes. In nutrient enrichment experiments, mixotrophic phytoplankton were favored over their obligate autotrophic competitors at low availability of nutrients or light. Thus, the ingestion of prey may have provided the mixotrophs with the currently limiting nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus, or both) as well as with carbon/energy when photosynthetic carbon acquisition was insufficient. In laboratory experiments with the mixotroph Poterioochromonas malhamensis, phototrophic growth supplemented heterotrophic growth when bacterial densities were similar to those found in oligo- to mesotrophic lakes. As a result, the mixotroph was able to dominate in terms of biomass over an obligate heterotroph (Spumella elongata) when light was available. Thus, depending on the prevailing environmental conditions, mixotrophy may be advantageous compared to obligate auto- or heterotrophy. In the examined oligotrophic clear-water lakes on the Faroe Island and in <b>S.</b> <b>Sweden,</b> mixotrophic phytoplankton composed a high proportion of the total algal biomass. Considering the high light availability in the epilimnia of the sampled lakes and the documented high photosynthetic capacities of the mixotrophic species present, bacterial ingestion was most likely a means to obtain limiting nutrients or growth factors. Although the grazing pressure exerted on bacteria by mixotrophs was low year round in Lake Skärlen (<b>S.</b> <b>Sweden),</b> the mixotrophs exerted a considerably higher grazing pressure on bacteria in the Faroese lakes. The observed differences may be a result of a higher nutrient competition in the Faroese lakes due to a higher importance of allochthonous carbon in these lakes...|$|E
