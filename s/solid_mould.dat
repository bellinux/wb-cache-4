Especially in many fields {{they can be a}} powerful low cost alternative to metalceramic composites. The most commonly encountered type of these composites is steel reinforced aluminium matrix composites which stand out with high wear and abrasion resistance. Significant fabrication processes of metal/metal composites are based on liquid metal techniques. In this study, Al/steel composite specimens were produced by using vacuum assisted <b>solid</b> <b>mould</b> investment casting technique. A 7075 wrought aluminium alloy were infiltrated into steel preforms, which were produced with 304 stainless steel and H 13 hot-work tool steel turnings, in the plaster based solid investment casting moulds.

40|$|Physical {{properties}} of both steels and mould slags are needed as input {{data for the}} mathematical modelling of the continuous casting process. Routines for calculating the {{properties of}} mould slags and for estimating steel properties have been developed and are described in Parts 1 and 2, respectively. Many mould powders, with differing compositions, are used in casting practice and their properties vary significantly. Reliable models {{have been developed to}} calculate these property values as a function of temperature from their chemical composition since this is available on a routine basis. Models have been developed to calculate the following properties: heat capacities, enthalpies, thermal expansion coefficient, density, viscosity, thermal conductivity and surface tension. <b>Solid</b> <b>mould</b> slags can exist as glassy or crystalline phases or as mixtures of the two (i. e. slag films) and the properties for the various phases can vary considerably; methods have been developed to calculate property values for these various states.

40|$|Crystallization {{of cocoa}} butter {{in the correct}} {{polymorphic}} form (Form V) leads to a volumetric contraction of tempered chocolate during solidification and aids in the ease of the demoulding process. Specific steps during chocolate bar manufacturing may result in an increased adhesion between chocolate and mould surface causing intermittent problems in demoulding. Adhesion is an important physical phenomenon commonly observed in many food-related situations. With respect to chocolate adhesion {{it is expected that}} the balance of the adhesion force between the chocolate and the mould and the cohesion force within the chocolate itself determines the stickiness at the chocolate-mould interface during demoulding. The research presented investigated the effect of surface thermodynamics and processing conditions on the observed extent of adhesion of (aerated) chocolate to four different mould materials (quartz glass, stainless steel, polycarbonate, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)). Surface energy of <b>solid</b> <b>mould</b> materials was calculated from experimental surface tension and contact angle data. An experimental set-up build around a Texture Analyser was developed for the experimental surface adhesion force determination, using a simple separation test between the solidified chocolate and a mould probe. Process conditions specific to the moulding and demoulding phases of the commercial chocolate manufacturing process have been investigated using this set-up. Surface energy (thermodynamics) {{has been shown to be}} the major factor controlling the adhesion between chocolate and a mould material. Chocolate-mould adhesion can be minimized if the total surface energy of the mould material is < 30 mN m-l,and the electron donor component 15 mN m- l. High surface energy materials are assumed to produce more compact crystal networks with a resulting increase in crystal-crystal interactions being responsible for difficulties demoulding. Processing parameters had a significant impact on the crystallization and solidification processes, and are therefore regarded as the key determining factors of chocolate-mould interactions. Demoulding can be optimised by pre-heating the mould under controlled environmental conditions (...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{is based on}} resezirch topic on synthetic bone constructive design. The research started from the need for bone reconstruction for fractured or damage bone. Studies on alternatives of synthetic bone {{have led to the}} development of bioceramic material because the material has biocompability with natural bone. The discovery of hydroxyapatite added the advantages of bioceramic as the material was found to have similar properties with natural bone. Other than that, it has the ability not only as bone graft material but also to facilitate bone growth. The appHcation of hydroxyapatite (HA) bone graft application has some limitation as the material is brittle. Thus, it can be categorised into the load bearing and non-load bearing application. The research focussed on non-load bearing application, particularly for skull damage cases. In cranioplasty surgeries, damaged skull bone need to be repaired. There are many material proposed such as titanium mesh, burr bole button and calcium phosphate cement. However, these materials have some limitation on the aspect of cost, material handling and radius curve and the bone growth facilitation. In this research slip casting technique was proposed to address the gap as it could be manufactured with cost effective and the ability to cast intricate shape and form. The HA was successfiilly synthesized with 1 lOOW microwave heat treatment and then freeze dried to obtain the powder form. The HA powder was then successfiilly converted into suspensions with sodium hexametaphosphate as dispersion agent. Prior to that, the HA was confirmed through x-ray diffraction (XRD) test. Thermal behaviour upon heating was investigated with thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC) and it was determined that 1100 °C is the sintered temperature. The slip casting produced non-uniform casting form. The slip casting produced a non-uniform casting thickness for hollow casting. However, the outcome is more promising when casted in <b>solid</b> <b>mould.</b> Due to the fast drying ability, the slip is more appropriate for solid casting as it could be produced within short duration. Low shrinkage is also another advantage, as the slip could be promising for the free hassle mass production and customized design. This basic casting ability is very promising to be introduced in the cranioplasty surgery in the fiitur...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of reliable numerical models {{is vital to}} improve the quality of continuously cast products and to increase the productivity of the casting machine. In order to provide accurate predictions, these models must include detailed descriptions of the physical phenomena occurring inside the mould, such as metal flow, heat transfer and solidification. However, these topics are often treated separately during modelling due to their complexity. This has a negative impact on the accuracy of the predictions. To address this issue, a numerical model capable of coupling the flow dynamics with both the heat transfer to the mould walls and solidification has been developed. The 2 ‐dimenional model is based on a commercial CFD code that solves the Navier‐Stokes Equations coupled with a Volume of Fluid interface tracking technique for the multiphase system slag‐steel‐air under transient conditions within a conventional slab mould. The use of an extremely fine mesh in the meniscus region (~ 50 μm) allows, for the first time, the explicit calculation of liquid slag infiltration into the shell‐mould gap. Heat transfer through the <b>solid</b> <b>mould</b> faces and mould oscillation were also included in the model to provide a more realistic representation of the process. The model developed was tested in two case studies. In the first case, the predicted values were compared to prior numerical models and laboratory experiments directed to casting of conventional slabs. Excellent agreement was found for characteristics such as slag film development and heat flux variations during mould oscillation. Furthermore, predicted values for shell thickness, consumption and heat flux were also found to be in good agreement with plant measurements. The findings of this case study provided improved, fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in slag infiltration and solidification inside the mould and how these affect key process parameters, such as powder consumption and shell growth. The second case study consisted of a sensitivity study, where casting conditions (e. g. casting speed, mould cooling, steel/slag properties and oscillation settings) were varied in the simulations to determine their effect on both powder consumption and the formation of defects. The simulations predicted the initial formation of typical casting defects known as oscillation marks, without the aid of any external data fitting. The key result drawn from the sensitivity study was the determination of simple rules for the calculation of consumption, heat flux and defect formation as a function of the casting conditions. This opens the possibility of using the model as a diagnostic tool and for process optimisation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceCONACYTSEPFIDERHCORUSEPSRCGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Screw compressor rotors are available in various profiles out of which “N” profile with 3 / 5 configurations is taken for the modeling and fabrication purpose.

The upscaled model is first characterized by the local thermal equilibrium assumption (LTE) between the liquid and the solid metallic phases leading to one energy conservation equation for the equivalent metallic phase. On the other hand, local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) between the equivalent continuous metallic phase and the mould is considered, giving rise to two coupled energy conservation equations.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{injection}} mould inserts obtained by stereolithography (SL) has various recommendations {{that are based}} on experimental work done by researchers over the last decade. There are no final conclusions about the best cooling technique for SL inserts. Moreover, no criteria are presented concerning structural and thermal designs based on stress-strain analysis, although a number of researchers consider ejection forces as the main failure effect of the SL tool. This work presents an alternative technique to cool down SL inserts, based on heat flux canals that are strategically positioned on hot areas along the cavity walls. Using this approach it is possible to keep direct contact between the back metal filling of the stereolithography insert and the injected thermoplastic material.

The staves are then inserted into the groove cut into the base. An odd number of staves must always be used in order to allow the weaver to continue running down the basket, if an even number of staves were used the weaver would end up having to skip a stave. Generally baskets contain between 31 and 51 staves (although many baskets contain more, or fewer) with the stave width being relative to the size of the basket. The staves are kept tight onto the mould with a thick rubber band. A long thin piece of rattan is used as the weaver.|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} aims {{to develop a}} novel technique for creation of composite riot helmet shells with reinforcing fibre continuity for better protection against low velocity impacts. In this research an innovative, simple and effective method of making a single-piece continuously textile reinforced helmet shell by vacuum bagging has been established and discussed. This technique also includes the development of <b>solid</b> collapsible <b>moulding</b> apparatus from non-woven fibres. Angle-interlock fabric due to its good mouldability, low shear rigidity and ease of production is used in this research. Several wrinkle-free single- piece composite helmet shells have been manufactured. Low-velocity impact test on the continuously reinforced helmet shells has been carried out. For this purpose an in-house helmet shell testing facility has been developed. Test rig has been designed {{in such a way}} that the impact test can be carried out at different locations at the riot helmet shell. Low-velocity impact test has been successfully conducted on the developed test rig. The practical experimentation and analysis revealed that the helmet shell performance against impact is dependent on the impact location. The helmet shell top surface has better impact protection as compared to helmet shell side and back location. Moreover, the helmet shell side is the most at risk location for the wearer. Finite Element models were created and simulated in Abaqus software to investigate the impact performance of single-piece helmet shells at different impact locations. Models parts have been designed in Rhinoceros software. Simulated results are validated by the experimental result which shows that the helmet top position is the safest position against an impact when it is compared to helmet back and helmet side positions.
