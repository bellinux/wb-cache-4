50|$|A mobile social {{address book}} is a phonebook on a mobile device that enables {{subscribers}} to build and grow their social networks. The mobile social address book transforms the phone book on any standard mobile phone into a social networking platform {{that makes it easier}} for <b>subscribers</b> to <b>exchange</b> contact information. The mobile social address book is the convergence of personal information management (PIM) and social networking on a mobile device. While standard mobile phonebooks force users to manually enter contacts, mobile social address books automate this process by enabling <b>subscribers</b> to <b>exchange</b> contact information following a call or SMS. The contact information exchange occurs instantaneously and the user’s phonebook updates automatically. Mobile social address books also provide dynamic updates of contacts if their numbers change over time.|$|R

5000|$|Originally, {{telephone}} exchanges consisted of manual boards operated by switchboard operators.

As {{the number of}} <b>subscribers</b> grew, multiple <b>exchanges</b> served individual neighborhoods of large cities. A city telephone number consisted of an exchange name and four digits, such as [...] "Pennsylvania 5000". A rural telephone number, often party line, was often up to four digits plus a letter or letter and digits to indicate which of the multiple parties on the line was desired.|$|R

In the proposed kiosk model, plain old telephones are connected to a WiMAX sub-scriber station using Foreign <b>Exchange</b> <b>Subscriber</b> and aMe-dia Gateway. The novelty of the kiosk based infrastructure models is that it has low deployment cost from a service provider perspective, and almost negligible equipment cost for the end user. In order to make the kiosk based model economically sus-tainable, the number of simultaneous voice calls that can be supported over the WiMAX subscriber stations needs to be maximized. To this end, the paper proposes a Dynamic Frame Profile algorithm to maximize the number of VoIP calls supported over a single subscriber station.

50|$|In the London {{telephone}} area, {{calls to}} subscribers {{who were not}} serviced by Director telephone systems within local call-charging range of the London Director exchange area were carried by tandem exchange Toll A: a subscriber would dial a prefix code, usually three letters, followed {{by the number of}} the other subscriber on the fringe non-director exchange. Calls from fringe non-director exchanges to numbers within the director area were passed in two ways. For those to director exchanges near the area boundary adjacent to the non-director <b>exchange,</b> <b>subscribers</b> were given codes to dial, and told to follow the code with the numerical portion of the other subscriber's number. For director exchanges remote from the area boundary, the subscriber was told to dial 7, to wait for a second dialling tone, and to follow this with the whole of the other number. These calls were handled by tandem exchange Toll B, from which the second dialling tone originated. To have a second dialling tone in this way was very unusual on the PSTN in the UK, although the French and Belgian PTTs had a similar instruction for when their customers made international calls.|$|R
40|$|Mobile phones {{have formed}} a social network within the phone {{subscriber}} population by allowing the phone <b>subscribers</b> to <b>exchange</b> information. Nowadays, smartphones have been improved {{with a variety of}} functionalities, such as a built-in cameras, motion sensors, and Wi-Fi wireless connectivity to enable the phone subscriber to take photographs of a desired object for distribution to other users through SMS or email. These functionalities make the mobile phones the perfect tool in terms of viral marketing within cellular phone subscribers. This thesis proposes a novel methodology that allows the phone subscriber to perform gestures for image acquisition from public signage displays. The public display is signage which displays a list of images in chronological order. The signage distributes the image list to nearby phones in the form of datagrams by means of multi-casts. Additionally, Wi-Fi connection between the phone and the signage must be established to enable multi-cast. When the phone has the completed image list downloaded, the phone subscriber can point the phone at the signage and perform a dragging gesture once he sees the desired image displayed by the signage. The current state of the project has concluded the development of the application to achieve the aforementioned task. However, the development of data transmission from one phone to another is still ongoing. Further development in the future would enable another gesture for data distribution to other phones in the vicinity. Web-based administration applications have also been developed to manage the image list in the signage. Through this web-based application, the administrator can generate new image list and then upload it to a FTP server. When the updated image list is stored in a remote FTP server, the signage periodically retrieves the image list from the FTP server. After the signage has received the updated image list, it then distributes the image list in the form of datagrams by means of multicasts. In summary, this thesis documents the impact of such technology in viral marketing research. 1 yea...|$|R

Thus spoken, for example, as [...] "nine, three; ring two, two" [...] to mean subscriber No. 93 with ringing code 2 long and 2 short, and written as [...] "93R22", (and if outside the given exchange, then the exchange would be asked for by name before the requested number and ringing code, e.g. [...] "Rockridge nine, three; ring one, two" [...] i.e. [...] "(On the) Rockridge (<b>exchange),</b> (<b>subscriber</b> No.) nine, three; ring one long, and two short," [...] and written as “Rockridge 93R12”.

[...] Again, however, it should be noted, whilst this practice was common, it was not ubiquitous, since despite giving a standard configuration for terse, easily interpreted numbers with their respective ring codes, its chief functional drawback was with the first ring always being long and the second always being short, this limited the number of brief and thus practical ringing combinations {{that could be used}} on single multiparty subscriber numbers.|$|R
40|$|Telephone {{service in}} Argentina has since its {{beginning}} been characterized {{as one of}} the most developed in South America. Regarding its development, two distinct periods can be identified. An initial period of private ownership extended from 1878 to 1946. In 1946, when the largest telephone company was bought by the state, a period of predominant state-ownership began that lasted until 1990 when the state-owned company was privatized. During this period, telephone service remained operated by private companies in several provinces. The aim of the study is to analyze the diffusion of telephone service in Argentina at the national and provincial levels focusing on the role of supply, demand, ownership and state regulation. Questions are raised on how these factors have influenced the development of telephone service in terms of number of <b>subscriber</b> lines and <b>exchanges.</b> Questions regarding the relationship between telecommunications and development are also addressed. An overview of the international expansion of the telephone from the early days beginning in the 1880 s through to the 1980 s is presented, particularly in the Americas and Europe, aiming to provide a picture of the international environment in which the events of the Argentine telecommunications development took place. Here, issues concerning ownership, regulation and spatial expansion of the telephone are highlighted in order to relate the empirical content to the analytical aim of the study. At the national level, the analysis focuses on the origins and expansion of telephone service in Argentina from 1878 to 1990. The evolution of supply and demand of telephones as well as the importance of changes in ownership and regulation during different periods is analyzed in an effort to highlight their relevance for the expansion of telephone service in Argentina. At the provincial level, the diffusion of telephone exchanges in the urban systems of a number of Argentine provinces is analyzed during a period of more than five decades. From the comparative analysis between the provinces, three stages in the process of diffusion are identified and the significance of owner¬ship, competition and regulation for the diffusion of the telephone in the provinces in question during different periods is discussed. Conclusions are also drawn regarding the contribution of telecommunications in the reduction of disparities among regions. The empirical evidence does not suggest that telecommunications contributed to more even development...|$|R
