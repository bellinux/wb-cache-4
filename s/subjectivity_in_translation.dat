30|$|Translation quality {{assessment}} (TQA) suffers from subjectivity in both neighboring disciplines: “TEFL” and “translation studies.” Al-qinai (2000) states {{that over the}} last two decade, studies (House 1977; Wilss 1982; Hatim & Mason 1990, Baker 1992; Horton 1998) have ventured to introduce objectivity instead of subjective impressionism in judging translation quality. Although different methods have been proposed to decrease the <b>subjectivity</b> <b>in</b> <b>translation</b> evaluation and to get closer to objectivity and reliability, their findings have not satisfied the experts of the field, and this domain calls for further studies.|$|E
40|$|Much {{criticism}} {{regarding the}} theory of hermeneutics in translation focuses on the acceptance of <b>subjectivity</b> <b>in</b> <b>translation.</b> One of the objections brought into discussion is the difficulty of hermeneutics in objectifying and formalizing the translator’s subjectivity, which in turn leads to the more radical question of the scientific status of hermeneutics itself. Surprisingly enough, critics often forget that a central aspect of the hermeneutical theory of translation,both {{in the past and}} at present, is the endeavour to find an acceptable scientific and intersubjective ground for interpretation. The aim {{of this article is to}} show how the hermeneutical theory of translation illustrates the play between subjective and intersubjective, subjective and objective dimensions. The contributions of F. Schleiermacher, R. Stolze and B. Stefanink to this topic will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Lin Shu {{translated}} {{many foreign}} works for Chinese readers, {{but he had}} to cooperate with his oral interpreters <b>in</b> his <b>translation</b> process because he knew nothing about foreign languages. Translators and reviewers often criticized that what Lin Shu did was to utter his own voice and that he was not a translator but a second-hand story teller. A review of existing studies on Lin Shu’s translation shows that they are mostly value judgments of correctness or adequacy of the translations using traditional perspective linguistic approach, which emphasizes the ‘faithfulness to the original’ principle. In the static text-centered studies, translator’s subjectivity has been almost completely neglected. This paper tries to analyze translator’s <b>subjectivity</b> <b>in</b> Lin’s <b>translation</b> from four aspects: selection of the original, translation purpose, and textual form and translation strategies. It comes to the conclusion that it is due to Lin’s subjectivity that his translations possessed a wide readership and became a great success <b>in</b> the literary <b>translation</b> history of China...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} two translations of O Alienista (by Machado de Assis) into French, {{both made}} by the same translator, Maryvonne Lapouge-Pettorelli, one published in a bilingual edition (Portuguese/French) {{and the other in}} a monolingual edition (French). The aim is to investigate, through the terms of Lawrence Venuti, if one of them would be more foreignizing ordomesticating than the other, especially from the conjecture that a bilingual edition presents strategies that usually lean to foreignization, as its consumer tends to have a greater interest in the foreign language and culture than the consumer of a monolingual edition. For this study, a brief examination of the paratextual elements of the editions is made and, based on Bernard Pottier's semantic theory about modalization, the linguistic modalities (which are, according to Maria Helena de Araújo Carreira, the material marks of the enunciator’s <b>subjectivity)</b> presented <b>in</b> the original text and compared with those contained <b>in</b> the two <b>translations</b> are analyzed, <b>in</b> the attempt to infer from it the degree of subjectivity of the translator itself in each edition. What justifies the use of this theory is the fact that, unlike the foreignizing translators, thedomesticating ones take greater freedom to adapt the original text to their own language and culture, to distance themselves from the author's subjectivity and therefore leave the marks of their own <b>subjectivity</b> <b>in</b> the <b>translation.</b> [URL] artigo analisa duas traduções d'O Alienista, de Machado de Assis, para a língua francesa, ambas feitas pela mesma tradutora, Maryvonne Lapouge-Pettorelli, uma delas publicada em uma edição bilíngue (português/francês) e a outra em uma edição unilíngue (francês). O objetivo é investigar, a partir dos termos de Lawrence Venuti, se uma delas seria mais estrangeirizadora ou domesticadora que a outra, sobretudo por se conjeturar que uma edição bilíngue geralmente apresente estratégias que pendem para a estrangeirização, já que o seu consumidor tende a ter um maior interesse pela língua e pela cultura estrangeira que o consumidor de uma edição unilíngue. Para tal estudo, faz-se um breve exame dos elementos paratextuais das edições em questão e, lançando-se mão da teoria semântica de Bernard Pottier sobre a modalização, analisam-se as modalidades linguísticas (que são, segundo Maria Helena de Araújo Carreira, as marcas materiais da subjetividade do enunciador) apresentadas no texto original em comparação com aquelas que figuram nas duas traduções, buscando-se dali depreender o grau de subjetividade da própria tradutora em cada uma das edições. Recorre-se a tal teoria pelo fato de que, ao contrário do tradutor estrangeirizador, o domesticador toma uma maior liberdade para adaptar o original à sua própria língua e cultura, para se distanciar da subjetividade do autor e, por conseguinte, deixar marcas de sua própria subjetividade na tradução.

Winibert Segers & Hendrik J Kockaert, KU Leuven Camiel Paulusstraat 8, 2630 Aartselaar, België Winibert. Segers@kuleuven. be Is translation evaluation a subjective, personal matter? Is evaluating translations {{the same as}} beer tasting or listening {{to a piece of}} music? Is the judgment determined by personal taste? We will try to answer those questions and to show how the subjectivity of the evaluation can be curtailed. The evaluation method that we use is the PIE method (Preselected Items Evaluation). PIE has five stages: • Preselection of items in the source text (before the test taking) • Determination of correct and incorrect solutions of the preselected items • Calculation of the scores of the candidates • Calculation of the difficulty degree (p-value) and the discriminatory power (d-index) of the preselected items • Calculation of the final scores of the candidates (This calculation is based on the preselected items with a good p-value and a good d-index.) status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{and tests}} a framework examining {{the relationship between}} <b>subjectivity</b> <b>in</b> performance evaluation and managerial performance. The framework predicts that <b>subjectivity</b> <b>in</b> performance evaluation is positively associated with psychological empowerment and supervisor-subordinate conflict. As previous studies established a positive association between empowerment and performance, and a negative association between conflict and performance, it is suggested in this thesis that <b>subjectivity</b> <b>in</b> performance evaluation has {{both positive and negative}} indirect associations with managerial performance. The investigation was undertaken using a sample of 102 anonymous managers who completed a mail survey. The data analysis was done using Partial Least Squares. This study finds that <b>subjectivity</b> <b>in</b> performance evaluation is a multidimensional construct. Subjectivity was split into two variables: process-based subjectivity and supervisor-based subjectivity. Both variables were related to managerial performance through positive and negative indirect associations. Process-based subjectivity is similar to supervisor-based subjectivity regarding its effect on supervisor-subordinate conflict, but it differs concerning its effect on access to information. This study is important as it investigates the competing effects of <b>subjectivity</b> <b>in</b> performance evaluation upon managerial performance. Further, the findings suggest that supervisor-subordinate conflict and access to information fully mediate the association between subjectivity and psychological empowerment. The contribution of this study to the literature lies in developing a new scale to measure <b>subjectivity</b> <b>in</b> performance evaluation and in providing additional empirical evidence regarding the effects of <b>subjectivity</b> <b>in</b> performance evaluation on managerial performance...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} how different mealtime situations help shape teenager and staff <b>subjectivities</b> <b>in</b> two Swedish residential care homes {{and a special}} school for girls and boys, 12 – 15 years old, with social, emotional, and behavioural difficulties. Three mealtime networks are analysed using concepts from actor–network theory, treating architectural space and artefacts, as well as teenagers and staff, as actors. The architectural spaces {{in the kitchen and}} dining room were first created for other purposes than residential care for troubled youth (i. e. a former farm, hospital, and preschool) and have been adapted to be more homelike while coping with housing and feeding 20 or more people. The original architectural spaces as well as activities before mealtimes were powerful actors in the mealtime network, causing different <b>subjectivities</b> to emerge <b>in</b> the <b>translations.</b> The <b>subjectivities</b> emerge <b>in</b> the first network as offenders/guards, in the second network as small children/nannies, and in the third network as guests/service staff.
