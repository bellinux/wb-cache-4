50|$|Many {{different}} tunings are used. Some <b>square</b> <b>neck</b> tunings are {{not recommended}} for round neck resonator guitars, owing to the high string tension required, which in turn requires the stronger <b>square</b> <b>neck.</b> Slack-key guitar tunings are most suitable for bottleneck playing, and conventional E-A-D-G-B-E guitar tuning is also popular.|$|E

50|$|Instruments {{designed}} exclusively as lap steel guitars {{typically have}} modified necks that make fretted playing impossible. The hollow neck acoustic lap steel, developed by Chris Knutsen and popularized by Weissenborn, extends the body cavity behind the neck {{all the way}} to the head. The square-necked resonator guitar has a strengthened <b>square</b> profile <b>neck,</b> allowing heavier string gauges and/or higher tunings that would normally be considered impossible (or certainly ill-advised) on a conventional guitar.

The fighting had been hand-to-hand combat and no quarter was given to the British regulars. The Zulus had been commanded to ignore the civilians in black coats and this meant that some officers, whose patrol dress was dark blue and black at the time, were spared and escaped.|$|R

40|$|In {{frameworks}} of the scaling {{theory of}} phase transitions and critical phenomena the quantitative dependence of macroscopic properties on nanostructural parameters in a polymeric material is revealed. The draw ratios at neck and at break {{are referred to}} the macroscopic properties. The structure is characterized by an average thickness of amorphous layers in isotropic melt-crystallized linear high density polyethylene which is chosen as an example. The <b>square</b> of the <b>neck</b> draw ratio {{is equal to the}} product of the square of the draw ratio at break and the chain ends collision probability. This probability in its turn is proportional to the average thickness of amorphous layers in the isotropic material. The neck draw ratio is a parameter of order. Polymers with flexible chains are solutions in solid state as well as in melt, the interacting ends of a marked chain serving as a solvent. At critical polymerization degree all the phases are identical. This research is an important contribution to the molecular theory of polymer liquids. It has been found that the melt viscosity vs the molecular weight of linear flexible-chain polymer follows the power law with the 3. 4 -exponent within the reptation model near the critical point. This is different from the value 3 expected for the melt of ring macromolecules. The rotation vibration precession motion of chain ends about the polymer melt flow direction were taken into account to find better agreement with the experiment.

A Zulu account relates the single-handed fight by the guard of Chelmsford's tent, a big Irishman of the 24th who kept the Zulus back with his bayonet until he was speared and the general's Union flag captured. Both the colours of the 2/24th were lost, while the Queen's colour of the 1/24th was carried off the field by Lieutenant Melvill on horseback but lost when he crossed the river, despite Lieutenant Coghill coming to his aid. Both Melvill and Coghill were killed after crossing the river, and would receive posthumous Victoria Crosses in 1907 as the legend of their gallantry grew, and, after twenty-seven years of steady campaigning by the late Mrs. Melvill (who had died in 1906), on the strength of Queen Victoria being quoted as saying that 'if they had survived they would have been awarded the Victoria Cross'.

The basic principle of the proposal {{is to create a}} bright urbanized area with a clearly organized traffic and movement of pedestrians. Square must in future comply with all requirements for functionality the central city area. Must fulfill both functions of assembly as well as commercial and cultural. Being an active center of the city, which will provide its residents an attractive environment for their identification with the place their home. The proposal's emphasis on compact solutions based on the classic city-forming compositions and standards.

Over time, the square was filled with a variety of often inconsistent or improper furniture, greenery and other solitaires, which, in combination with parking {{across the surface of the}} <b>square</b> and double <b>necks</b> impairment of the main urban area. The main aim of the project I had solve the traffic situation, cleansing and unification of Square and finally to incorporate revive nearby parish church. The proposal defines the space Palacky Square following the original historical rectangle plan approaching and divides it into three parts: The first part is a central rectangular area, which blended currently fragmented space. This empty space showcases a Baroque plague column and the fountain with the statue of St. Florian. As a counterweight to the plague column and the fountain is in the opposite half of the rectangle designed water feature in the form of three water jets, which creates a water column of a time his height. Water features does not make the water and in the case of holding larger events it is possible to turn off the water element and thereby clear the entire area of central rectangle. Water feature highlights the main entrance to the church. The central rectangular space will be used as the venue for cultural, sporting and market activities. The second part is operating within the traffic lane pedestrian zones defined lighting and street furniture around the perimeter of serving in a restricted mode for supply. The third part of the irregular portion adjacent to the home life partners defined various commercial activities. Within Comenius Square was left a greater number of parking spaces, but that was přeřešeno such a way as to create wider sidewalks along the larger home and a new expansion bays for seating and meeting and commercial purposes neighboring establishments catering zařízení. 4 Almost all surfaces are vertically aligned and newly paved granite chipped tiles (using the existing historic paving).
