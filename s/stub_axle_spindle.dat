50|$|In 1909 H.F.S. Morgan {{introduced}} a fundamentally similar system using a sliding <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> {{on a fixed}} pillar, used first on Morgan Motor Company cyclecars, then on their cars up to the current time. The Morgan design is an inverted sliding pillar, as are most of the later designs; the pillar {{is attached to the}} chassis and the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> is carried by the sliding sleeve over this.|$|R
50|$|Some {{trailers}} {{support a}} normal axle on two sides, others mount the wheel off one {{side with a}} <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> (a one sided axle).|$|R
50|$|Recumbent tadpole {{or reverse}} trike is a {{recumbent}} design with two steered wheels {{at the front}} and one driven wheel at the back, though one model has the front wheels driven while the rear wheel steers. Steering is either through a single handlebar linked with tie rods to the front wheels' <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> assemblies (indirect) or with two handlebars (rather, two half-handlebars) each bolted to a steerer tube, usually through a bicycle-type headset and connected to a <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> assembly (direct). A single tie rod connects {{the left and right}} axle assemblies.|$|R
50|$|Common {{applications}} of the process are for piston rods of shock absorbers, cylinders and rods for hydraulic systems, pumps, <b>axles,</b> <b>spindles</b> and valves.|$|R
50|$|The Week-End had conventional, fixed {{landing gear}} with each mainwheel {{mounted on a}} <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> {{provided}} with a torsional shock absorber. Each axle was at the convergence of three struts from the lower fuselage. There was a small tailskid.|$|R
50|$|Hamster {{wheels are}} {{exercise}} devices. Most {{of these devices}} consist of a runged or ridged wheel held on a stand by a single or pair of <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> Hamster wheels allow rodents to run even when their space is confined.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> {{is named}} so because it resembles {{the shape of}} a stub, like a {{truncated}} end of an axle, short in shape and blunt.There are four following method those are1. Elliot strub axle2. Reversed elliot3. Lemoine4. Lemoine inverted ...|$|R
5000|$|Wheel {{moves forward}} as it rises, {{can also be}} poor for impact {{harshness}} (this can be negated by designing the beam with the mounts higher than the <b>stub</b> <b>axles,</b> which impacts on the floorpan height, and causes more roll oversteer) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{top link}} is a fixed-length {{half-shaft}} universally jointed at each end. The universal joints act as {{inner and outer}} pivots for the top link, which rotates to transmit drive from its inner pivot at {{the output of the}} differential/brake unit to its outer pivot at the wheel carrier. The wheel carrier {{takes the form of a}} splined <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> (for knock-off wheels) or a <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> and hub plate (for 5-lug wheels). In later XJS models with outboard rear brakes, the wheel carrier, brake discs and parking brake drum were a single cast steel unit. In all cases the wheel carrier runs in bearings mounted in a large cast aluminium hub carrier.|$|R
5000|$|In 1947 Earle MacPherson {{patented}} the MacPherson strut {{for use on}} the Chevrolet Cadet. [...] This was {{the first}} true strut suspension for cars: the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> was rigidly fixed to the strut, thus always keeping the same angle with it, rather than being attached through a swivelling joint as for Stout's Scarab.|$|R

50|$|The D.480 had a fixed, {{conventional}} undercarriage with a {{track of}} 2.80 m. Each mainwheel was {{mounted on a}} <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> at the vertex of a V-strut hinged on the lower fuselage longeron, with a near-vertical sprung leg, with an oleo strut shock absorber, to the wing spar. The tailwheel was on a long, hinged leg close to the rear fuselage with a short, vertical shock absorber.|$|R
50|$|The Peitz had a {{tail skid}} {{undercarriage}} with each wheel on a steel <b>stub</b> <b>axle,</b> hinged on a V-strut {{from the lower}} fuselage and with a short vertical elastic shock absorber leg to the forward wing strut This junction was strengthened by extra struts to the forward fuselage and {{to the top of}} the forward, vertical cabane strut and by another long strut outwards {{to the top of the}} rear wing spar.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} used {{very tall}} uprights with the wheel spindles {{on one side}} and a short <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> extending inwards on the other. Springing was by vertically mounted coil-over-damper units mounted inboard and operated through rocker-style upper arms. The lower arms were conventional wide-based wishbones made of a one-piece wishbone and long radius arm running back towards the bulkhead. Steering was rack-and-pinion mounted high, at the same level as the upper wishbone.|$|R
25|$|The main {{undercarriage}} was a robust split-axle construction with the legs joining the wings {{at the bottom}} of the X-form centre-section struts. Braced <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> carried the arrester claws required by the longitudinal arrester wires of Royal Navy aircraft carriers up to 1926. The undercarriage assembly was designed so that it could be easily removed with the aircraft on trestles, and replaced with a pair of aluminium single-step, V-bottomed round-topped floats. These carried water rudders for manoeuvring afloat.|$|R
50|$|A sliding pillar {{suspension}} {{is a form}} {{of independent}} front suspension for light cars. The <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> and wheel assembly are attached to a vertical pillar or kingpin which slides up and down through a bush or bushes which are attached to the vehicle chassis, usually as part of transverse outrigger assemblies, sometimes resembling a traditional beam axle, although fixed rigidly to the chassis. Steering movement is provided by allowing this same sliding pillar to also rotate.|$|R
50|$|The Ca.61a had a conventional, fixed {{undercarriage}} with double-tyred mainwheels {{under the}} outer engines. Each wheel was hinged on a V-strut from the fuselage {{side and a}} narrow V drag strut from the aft spar to the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> ends. A vertical, shock absorbing strut joined the axle to the forward spar. There were tailskids {{at the ends of}} the booms and a large nosewheel, half buried in the fuselage below the gunner, in case of nose-overs.|$|R

5000|$|The pole {{speed that}} was {{accomplished}} by Dink Widenhouse was [...] while the average speed was [...] Other notable drivers who participated included Lee Petty, Herb Thomas, Dink Widenhouse, Fonty Flock, and Junior Johnson. All twenty-two drivers who qualified were American-born. Twelve drivers failed to finish the race due to <b>axle,</b> <b>spindle,</b> coil, wheel, frame, vapor lock, tire, gasket, and bearing problems.|$|R
5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame was made from 40mm steel tubing, as were the steering head, the single-sided front fork, and the single-sided swingarm. The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the left on <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> attached to the suspension on the right.|$|R
5000|$|Hamster wheels or [...] {{running wheel}} are {{exercise}} devices used primarily by hamsters and other rodents, {{but also by}} other cursorial animals when given the opportunity. Most of these devices consist of a runged or ridged wheel held on a stand by a single or pair of <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> Hamster wheels allow rodents to run even when their space is confined. The earliest dated {{use of the term}} [...] "hamster wheel", located by the Oxford English Dictionary, is in a 1949 newspaper advertisement.|$|R
5000|$|Murray and {{his brother}} Ray Murray were put out of {{contention}} {{when one of the}} [...] "Grey Ghost"'s <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> and its king pin broke, but he was able {{to get back on the}} road with a loss of only 70 points thanks to fellow-competitor Robert Whan, who allowed Murray to cannibalize his own car, which had crashed into a tree.He lost 69 further points when he took a wrong turn after Mt Isa, and ended up at the Mary Kathleen uranium fields.|$|R
50|$|Many modern cars use {{rack and}} pinion {{steering}} mechanisms, where the steering wheel turns the pinion gear; the pinion moves the rack, which is a linear gear that meshes with the pinion, converting circular motion into linear motion along the transverse axis of the car (side to side motion). This motion applies steering torque to the swivel pin ball joints that replaced previously used kingpins of the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> of the steered wheels via tie rods and a short lever arm called the steering arm.|$|R
50|$|Sliding pillar {{independent}} suspension {{was first used}} by Decauville in 1898, the first recorded instance of independent front suspension on a motor vehicle. In this system, the <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> carrying the wheel was fixed {{to the bottom of}} a pillar which slid up and down through a bush in a transverse axle fixed {{to the front of the}} chassis. The top of the pillar was fixed and pivoted on a transverse semi-elliptic leaf spring. This system was copied by Sizaire-Naudin a few years later.|$|R
5000|$|Sunday {{produced}} threatening skies, but no rain. On {{the last}} lap {{of the morning}} warm-up, the rear <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> on Andretti's Lotus broke in the left-hander entering The Anvil (nicknamed [...] "Ickx's Corner" [...] after a crash the Belgian had there in 1976). The car spun several times and then hit the barrier, knocking off a rear wheel. Faulty material in the part was blamed, and, with no time to test the spare car, Andretti used his teammate Jean-Pierre Jarier's car for the race.|$|R
2500|$|In 1883 Starbucks {{supplied}} {{a further}} two single deck cars, {{similar to the}} original batch, followed in 1884 by two more. These were known as summer cars, they were painted all over green, and were of the [...] "toast-rack" [...] design, being extremely low, with the foot-boards only just off the ground. The seats were built immediately above the wheels, which were mounted or <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> Two further standard single deck cars were bought from Starbucks in 1885 {{and in the same}} year Car No.19 (being a Starbuck of 1881) was converted into a double decker.|$|R
2500|$|The Harrow {{had to have}} a clear space {{below the}} {{fuselage}} to allow torpedo dropping. The main legs were attached to the front spar at the ends of the centre section, and pairs of bracing struts ran from the <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> to the lower fuselage longerons. [...] Snap link hooks were fitted to the inner ends of the axles to engage with the longitudinal arrester wires of the time. The specification required that the land undercarriage could be replaced rapidly with floats. [...] These were long, single stepped and fitted with water rudders, built by Short Brothers.|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} new components, design engineers nowadays have {{at their disposal}} {{a large body of}} fatigue data obtained from notched and unnotched specimens. These data are transferable to fatigue-critical areas for both constant and variable amplitude loading when state of material, strength, geometry, surface, and surface layer as well as the loading mode are taken into account. The procedure of transforming these data is discussed using the example of a random loaded truck <b>stub</b> <b>axle,</b> using as failure criteria the first technically detectable crack, local equivalent stress/strain and maximum stressed/strained material volume. In addition, the problem of fatigue life assessment is addressed...|$|R
50|$|The axle passes {{beneath the}} loadbed {{of the cart}} but was cranked upwards at each side. This allows the load to be carried low, for {{stability}} and ease of loading with heavy objects such as churns or barrels. The high position of the <b>stub</b> <b>axles</b> allow large wheels, giving a smooth ride. The box body is open at the rear, {{with no more than}} a chain across for safety. Rather than a driving seat or box, they are driven from a standing position, alongside the load. Floats were drawn by a single horse or, especially in Ireland, a donkey.|$|R

50|$|H.F.S. Morgan's 1909 Runabout used sliding pillar suspension, an {{independent}} front suspension system with each front wheel mounted on a <b>stub</b> <b>axle</b> able to slide {{up and down a}} fixed pillar that also acts as the kingpin and supported by a spring and external shock absorber (damper). One advantage is reduced unsprung weight, theoretically allowing the tire and wheel to better respond to road surface irregularities. The Morgan system is described as an 'inverted' sliding pillar, as the pillar is fixed and the hub carrier slides over it. Earlier systems had the wheel carried on the pillar, sliding through a bush on the axle.|$|R
50|$|The smooth, oval section {{fuselage}} was ply {{and fabric}} covered, tapering towards the tail. The pilot sat low {{down in a}} small open cockpit with narrow streamlined dorsal fairings in front and behind. His view forward was severely restricted by the central inline bank of four cylinders of the W-12 Lorraine-Dietrich 12E water-cooled piston engine. The engine was cooled by radiators in the wings, assisted for the first flight by a bank of radiators mounted between the undercarriage legs. These backward leaning legs were wide chord, faired cantilevers with large, unfaired wheels mounted on individual <b>stub</b> <b>axles.</b> The V.1's conventional undercarriage was completed by a small tailskid.|$|R
