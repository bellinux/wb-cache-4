5|$|At a {{party in}} the Great Northern to welcome the new investors, Benjamin and Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) {{secretly}} discuss their plan to burn the town's sawmill and buy the land cheaply. Leland begins sobbing hysterically when {{a piece of music}} begins, and Martell escorts him away. Meanwhile, Shelly waits at home with her gun, as Johnson arrives back. Hank attacks him beside his truck, threatening him; Johnson returns home and lashes out at Shelly, and <b>she</b> <b>draws</b> the gun and shoots him.|$|E
5|$|Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was {{intended}} by Etty {{to illustrate the}} virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart {{as he prepares to}} kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and her clothes fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as <b>she</b> <b>draws</b> her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by Henry Fuseli, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} Hatoful Boyfriend {{begin in the}} year 2188, when the protagonist, a teenage human girl invited to attend the prestigious bird-only St. PigeoNation's Institute, starts her second year of high school. After a hectic and surreal {{freshman}} year of attendance at St. PigeoNation's, the protagonist has grown accustomed to the confusion of being the only human in a school full of birds, and {{is looking forward to}} her sophomore year. The story of the dating simulation portion of the game follows the protagonist, and the inter-species love and hijinks—of both the mundane high school and quasi-anthropomorphic bird-specific varieties—that ensue as <b>she</b> <b>draws</b> the attention of and attempts to romance {{one of a number of}} eligible birds she comes in contact with over the course of the year.|$|E
5000|$|<b>She</b> <b>drew</b> for [...] {{and their}} comics Mis Cuentos, Alicia, Cuentos de la Abuelita, and [...] For Editorial Bruguera <b>she</b> <b>drew</b> Sissi and Cuentos Rositas in their women's publications, and Cuentos for girls.|$|R
5000|$|She {{has also}} done art for comics publishers. In 2008, <b>she</b> <b>drew</b> the story [...] "The Hollows" [...] {{for the first}} issue of the DC/Vertigo comic House of Mystery written by Bill Willingham. Beginning in 2012 <b>she</b> <b>drew</b> a run of Image Comics' Glory series written by Joe Keatinge. <b>She</b> <b>drew</b> issues of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for IDW, and in March 2015 she became the artist for their new Jem and the Holograms series written by Kelly Thompson.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in the 1970s, {{she focused}} on illustration. <b>She</b> <b>drew</b> for the [...] strips Claro de Luna and Romántica i Marilin. It was also for this {{publisher}} that <b>she</b> <b>drew,</b> with scripts by Roy Mark (the pseudonym of [...] ), the series Mary Noticias.|$|R
5|$|Barn owls are cavity nesters. They choose {{holes in}} trees, {{fissures}} in cliff faces, the large nests of other birds {{such as the}} hamerkop (Scopus umbretta) and, particularly in Europe and North America, old buildings such as farm sheds and church towers. Buildings are preferred to trees in wetter climates in the British Isles and provide better protection for fledglings from inclement weather. Trees tend to be in open habitats {{rather than in the}} middle of woodland and nest holes tend to be higher in North America than in Europe because of possible predation by raccoons (Procyon lotor). No nesting material is used as such but, as the female sits incubating the eggs, <b>she</b> <b>draws</b> in the dry furry material of which her regurgitated pellets are composed, so that by the time the chicks are hatched, they are surrounded by a carpet of shredded pellets. Oftentimes other birds such as jackdaws (Corvus monedula) nest in the same hollow tree or building and seem to live harmoniously with the owls.|$|E
5|$|Guerrero {{was raised}} in the Jamaica Plain and Roxbury neighborhoods of Boston after being taken in by other Colombian families. She has had an {{interest}} in acting since a young age and took advantage of free opportunities in the neighborhood or at school. Then she attended Boston Arts Academy, a performing arts high school, where she was in the music department. Among her high school activities was singing with a jazz group, but she anticipated pursuing political science and communications in college. In 2010, she appeared in the Faces music video that was shot in Norwood, Massachusetts for Louie Bello. Her first job after college was in a law office. At age 24, she decided to pursue a career in acting. In 2011, she moved to New York City and studied acting at the Susan Batson Studios where she met her manager Josh Taylor. Guerrero's life experience compels her to advocate for immigration reform and is an influence that <b>she</b> <b>draws</b> upon in her acting.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When <b>she</b> <b>draws</b> the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>drew</b> {{him back}} into the churchyard again. Along the wall there was an avenue of limes--a cool and {{pleasant}} walk wherein idlers lounged on Sundays in summer after service. Thither <b>she</b> <b>drew</b> him. He went almost mechanically. Her sympathy stirred his sorrow again, as sympathy so often does.|$|R
60|$|She sighed, {{and seemed}} to wake up, then she kissed him again. Then she {{loosened}} herself {{away from him and}} took his hand. It hurt him when <b>she</b> <b>drew</b> away from his breast. It hurt him with a chagrin. Why did <b>she</b> <b>draw</b> away from him? But she held his hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>drew</b> {{her fingers}} {{slowly through the}} water without speaking.|$|R
25|$|<b>She</b> <b>draws</b> acting {{influences}} from Lucille Ball, Ann-Margret, and Nancy Sinatra, {{whom she}} admires for their audacity, femininity, and beauty. She also prefers surrealist cinema and admires {{films such as}} Big Fish, Pleasantville, and American Beauty.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian artist, Sarah Maloney, {{has created}} a series of sculptures of Magnolia flowers in bronze and steel, {{entitled}} First Flowers, in which <b>she</b> <b>draws</b> {{our attention to the}} dual symbols of beginnings in the flower, as both an evolutionary archetype and also one of the first trees to flower in spring (see illustration).|$|E
25|$|A {{woman whose}} life is split between her lover (a loss adjuster) and husband {{worries about the}} {{whereabouts}} of her teenage son and wonders about the rules of cricket. Her husband draws elaborate diagrams of fielding positions, in contrast her lover prefers mystery. As the woman becomes more intrigued by the game <b>she</b> <b>draws</b> parallels between the characters in her life and the strategies of the game...|$|E
50|$|In 2002, <b>she</b> <b>drew</b> the Manifesto for UNESCO Italian National Commission.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>drew</b> {{away from}} him, gently, {{and turned toward}} the window.|$|R
60|$|She hesitated. Her {{cheeks were}} flushed. <b>She</b> <b>drew</b> herself up proudly.|$|R
25|$|Martine Cotten: this Breton {{artist has}} lived in les Saintes {{for more than twenty}} years. With soft pastels <b>she</b> <b>draws</b> on vellum paper scenes and panoramas of les Saintes and Brittany (Pont-Aven) which she sells and {{exhibits}} in her shop in the small port of Terre-de-Haut. Her art is appreciated by collectors and business managers. A lot of exhibitions are dedicated to her in France and abroad.|$|E
25|$|The miniseries {{opens with}} a prologue set in 1991. Young Annie Wheaton (played as a child by Kristen Fischer, and later as a {{teenager}} by Kimberly J. Brown) is drawing {{a picture of a}} house as her parents and older sister, Rachel (Melanie Lynskey), argue outside her room. As <b>she</b> <b>draws</b> lines down over the house in her picture, rocks fall through the roof of an identical house belonging to an elderly couple down the street whose dog had bitten Annie, severely damaging the building.|$|E
25|$|Hahn {{encourages}} {{the viewer to}} think deeper, not only {{through the use of}} different physical processes in her artwork, but also through the multiplicity of meanings in her photographs. In most of her work, Hahn integrates humor and irony as she explores the meanings generated by formal combinations. Some of her prints include the sprocket holes of the 35mm negative, which allude to its 35mm film origins: but by hand coloring with bright paints, <b>she</b> <b>draws</b> attention to the mixture of craft with industrial mediums.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>drew</b> a quick little {{breath and}} looked nervously over her shoulders.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>drew</b> her cloak {{around her}} and flitted away into the darkness.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>drew</b> {{her lips}} up till her teeth {{gleamed in the}} moonlight.|$|R
25|$|While Joe remains {{hidden in}} a shabby rented room, Carmen {{secretly}} visits Husky's gym to ask Frankie for a loan, but she insists she has no money of her own. Carmen returns to the boarding house {{with a bag of}} groceries, and Joe questions how she paid for them. The two argue, and she goes to Husky's hotel suite to play cards with her friends. When <b>she</b> <b>draws</b> the nine of spades, she interprets it as a premonition of impending doom and descends into a quagmire of drink and debauchery.|$|E
25|$|Le Guin {{exploits}} {{the creative}} {{flexibility of the}} science fiction and fantasy genres to undertake thorough explorations of dimensions of both social and psychological identity and of broader cultural and social structures. In doing so, <b>she</b> <b>draws</b> on sociology, anthropology, and psychology, leading some critics to categorize her work as soft science fiction. She has objected to this classification of her writing, arguing the term is divisive and implies a narrow view of what constitutes valid science fiction. There are also the underlying ideas of anarchism and environmentalism that make repeated appearances throughout Le Guin's work.|$|E
25|$|Battle Magnus {{make up the}} characters' decks. Outside of battle, {{the player}} assembles a deck of Magnus for each party member, from which he or <b>she</b> <b>draws</b> random hands during {{subsequent}} combats. Hand size, deck size and maximum combo size increase as the player upgrades the party members' class by finding character-specific Magnus and having them applied at the church. Weapon cards are used to fight with, Armor cards to block with, and Effect cards cause different effects, such as healing. Each Magnus has a Spirit Number in the corner ranging from 1-9. The Spirit Numbers are utilized during battle {{in order to create}} straights and same-number groupings (pairs, three-of-a-kinds, etc.), resulting in an increased damage effect. On cards with multiple spirit numbers, the player can select which number they want to use by rolling the C-stick.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>drew</b> herself up, and sat looking {{straight}} before her, far away.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>drew</b> him {{a little}} closer to her. Her eyes {{questioned}} him.|$|R
60|$|Her hands {{dropped on}} to the coverlet, and he grasped them in his own. How oft had <b>she</b> <b>drawn</b> away at his touch. Now <b>she</b> yielded, <b>drawing</b> nearer to him, still on her knees.|$|R
500|$|<b>She</b> <b>draws</b> {{inspiration}} from classic films as well. Her stage makeup {{is characterized by}} dramatic glitter makeup at her right eye, inspired by A Clockwork Orange. The video for [...] "Your Love Is My Drug" [...] features animated sequences inspired by The Beatles' film, Yellow Submarine, while the Get Sleazy tour was described as having a [...] "post-apocalyptic Mad Max vibe." ...|$|E
500|$|Classification, school? Barbara Howard's work defies {{specific}} slotting, {{although we}} sense her {{recognition of the}} heritage left by great masters, Turner being the most obvious. But <b>she</b> <b>draws</b> and paints in direct response to her own muse and as such cannot be aligned to any particular art movement ..... for [...] in common with other maverick artists throughout art history, her work, although bound to no age, is relevant to all.|$|E
500|$|Gertie the Dinosaur is the {{earliest}} animated film to feature a dinosaur. [...] Its star Gertie does tricks {{much like a}} trained elephant. [...] She is animated in a naturalistic style unprecedented for the time; she breathes rhythmically, she shifts her weight as she moves, and her abdominal muscles undulate as <b>she</b> <b>draws</b> water. [...] McCay imbued her with a personality—while friendly, she could be capricious, ignoring or rebelling against her master's commands.|$|E
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>drew</b> {{attention}} after {{performing in}} a music video Sunset Point by Gulzar.|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>drew</b> {{support from}} the Oregon Right to Life PAC and the NRA.|$|R
