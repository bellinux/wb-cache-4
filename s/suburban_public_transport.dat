The weak links in the overall Intermodal passenger transport chain are considered to be the Intermodal Terminals, as often inadequate planning leads to the reduction of the level of service of the means using the station, thus resulting in partial or total disdain for its users and the shift of the latter to other transport modes, mostly to private vehicles. Instead, an integrated design with emphasis on Intermodal Terminals which acts as the interface between the different modes not only increases the proportion of commuters who use urban <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> but also consolidates the overall <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> system of an urban area. Thus the main objective of this paper is to investigate how the provided level of service of passenger Intermodal facilities affects the commuters’ behavior regarding the modal choice. Towards this objective a categorization of the various terminals is attempted, considering their specific characteristics in terms of the means that they serve as well as the commuters that use them, in order to establish general design rules for each category. In this categorization all urban and <b>suburban</b> Intermodal <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> Terminals as well as Intermodal Terminals between means of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> and private cars (Park and Ride facilities) were considered. Finally, a case study was executed based on a kind of a Revealed Preference Survey for the Intermodal Terminals of the city of Athens, in order to examine the impact of their operation on the number of interchanges between the various transport modes. The results of this study provide some useful points how a better organization of passenger Intermodal facilities affects the commuters’ behavior...|$|R

40|$|SCATTER tackles {{the issue}} of urban sprawl, in {{particular}} {{in the context of}} cities implementing new <b>suburban</b> <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> services. Urban sprawl is widespread in Europe: in a growing number of cities, population and employment in central areas is declining while increasing rapidly in suburban and peripheral areas and this induces a high level of car use and, usually, congestion on roads with access to city centres. To limit the damage caused by urban sprawl in terms of congestion, air pollution and energy consumption, many European cities are implementing (or planning to implement) <b>suburban</b> <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> services, such as heavy or light rail. But by improving accessibility, they create an incentive for a new wave of urban sprawl. Therefore, in parallel with these new public transport services, accompanying measures have to be elaborated and implemented, in order to prevent and mitigate the sprawl phenomenon. SCATTER is a project under the European Commission DG Research, "Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development Programme" and is part of the LUTR projects cluster. The project comprises six case cities: Brussels, Stuttgart, Bristol, Helsinki, Rennes and Milan and has the final objective to provide recommendations and guidelines to European cities and design an "urban sprawl monitoring tool"...|$|E

This should also considerably enhance Belgrade tourist offer. Basic goals for introducing ropeway systems in Belgrade are: connecting most attractive parts of the city, introducing traffic system complementary to existing public transport systems, developing sustainable means of transport and reducing the urgency to expanding capacities of existing public transport systems, developing entertaining and attractive alternative transport, creating possibilities for new investments in the zone of future station locations, redesigning the image of the Belgrade as a city with a recognizable motif...|$|E

40|$|Previous studies [1] have {{analysed}} {{the walking}} catchment area for light rail and metropolitan rail stops in suburban parts of Dublin city’s south-side. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to establish the catchment zone of stops on a bus corridor, also within the same sector of Dublin city. The 2012 study looked at stops in four bands across the urban area, including: Urban, Outer Urban, Inner Suburban and Outer <b>Suburban.</b> <b>Public</b> <b>transport</b> users were surveyed at each stop and their street of trip origin identified. This information was then used to identify and approximate the catchment area for public transport at that stop. This study focuses on the Stillorgan Quality Bus Corridor (QBC) from Cabinteely to Leeson Street. Bus stops in each of the respective urban bands were identified and user surveys carried out at each. Across the 4 survey locations over 50 % of trip-origins are more than 500 m (as the crow flies) from the bus stop. An 85 th percentile analysis suggests natural catchment limits of 950 m – 1, 100 m. This equates to a catchment area traditionally associated in the literature with quality rail services. Catchment areas for quality bus corridor appear comparable and often greater than those for LRT or metro rail. Approximately 1 in 7 (14 %) of all passengers surveyed transferred either from or to another public transport service as part of their journey. This appears very significant in an urban transport market traditionally associated with low or negligible levels of transferability, especially as it is corroborated by studies in other parts of the city showing even higher levels of transfer [5]. Overall, public transport users seem very satisfied with the Quality of Service provided. The study indicates that bus corridors with sufficiently high levels of service can have comparable or even greater walking catchment areas than light and metropolitan rail corridors. Public transport users, based on surveys of three adjacent modal corridors in the Greater Dublin Area, appear to be more influenced by Level of Service than by modal type...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{for urban}} planners the key strategies and tactics {{that can be}} deployed to improve <b>suburban</b> <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> networks. Introduction The governance and management of public transport systems is {{an essential component of}} metropolitan planning and urban management. Most metropolitan strategies in Australia and in other jurisdictions presuppose the provision of public transport. Yet there is often a disconnection between transport plans and land-use schemes. Similarly, metropolitan land-use plans that do integrate with transport plans tend to focus on infrastructure rather than service quality and connectivity. A failure to adequately consider the quality of public transport networks in land-use planning analysis has the potential to produce poor planning outcomes in two key ways. First new land-uses may be inadequately served with public transport services, leading to dependence on alternative travel modes, such as cars. Second, the failure to recognise the significance of well-planned local public transport networks may result in the preclusion of some land-use options. This preclusion may relate to the location of land-uses or their design, such as over-provision of carparking. The continuing debate over whether to address suburban cardependence via land-use change or via transport planning is a case in point. And while the arguments in favour of and against land-use change as a means to overcome car dependence are well known in the planning literature. There is a growing if not yet widely appreciated literature that advocates improvements to public transport network planning and coordination as a means of reducing car dependence. The recognition of improved public transport network planning as a means of reducing car dependence is immensely significant because it offers planners an additional or alternative tool for managing urban transport patterns beyond land-use variation or investment in heavy infrastructure. Urban planning practitioners are not yet well served and informed by the broader public transport planning literature on the advantages of public transport network planning. While there is an extensive literature focusing on the economics and engineering of urban public transport systems the planning literature on the practices that contribute to success in public transport network design and operations is relatively poorly documented. There is also very little literature dedicated to public transport network design within Australian cities which are distinguished by highly centralised radial heavy rail networks with bus or tram networks that are well developed in inner urban zones but less so in the outer suburbs. The remainder of this paper has four objectives for transport planning theory and practice. First the paper reviews the literature on public transport network planning principles; next the paper attempts to formulate these principles in practical terms such that they can be applied to line and network design; third the paper considers further dimensions of network planning, including institutional arrangements and transition points in network design. The paper is intended for three audiences. The first is planning scholars who are involved in debates about public transport. The second is strategic policy officials in planning agencies who are involved in the planning and design of public transport networks. The third audience comprises those involved in development processes and who seek insights into the technical components of public transport network planning. Some caveats are appropriate however. The paper is not seeking to justify public transport network planning. The authors consider that the case for dedicated planning is implicit in the assumption that cities should provide good quality public transport to their residents. The wider case in favour of network planning has been successfully advanced elsewhere. Conversely, the paper is not intended as a directly applicable manual of detailed transport planning practice. While it does offer some insights into the practical public transport network planning task such guidance is better provided by Nielsen et al and Vuchic. Instead the paper highlights for urban planners the key strategies and tactics for that can be deployed to improve <b>suburban</b> <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> networks. Understanding these principles should thus assist urban planners – and urban scholars – to better shape and evaluate urban development processes and patterns...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{problems}} of ensuring balanced and sustainable development of a very specific and important metropolitan region of the Russian Federation ? the region of St Petersburg and surrounding it Leningrad Oblast. St. Petersburg (City) and Leningrad Oblast (Region) are both constituent entities of the Russian Federation and part of North-West Federal District. The City and the Region are connected with each other by thousands of various relationships: historical, cultural, socio-demographic, economic, labor, transport and administrative. For {{a long period of}} time, the City and the Region were part of a single administrative-territorial entity and had common governance bodies that applied a common approach to their development. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in late 1991 the system that ensured consistent management of the development of the City and Region was destroyed. However, no system was created {{that could be used to}} coordinate the development of the City and the Region. In the last two decades, problems between the City and the Region arise increasingly often, many of which cannot be solved on the basis of agreed positions of both parties. In 2012 - 2013 both Leningrad Region and St Petersburg developed their long-term vision documents: Leningrad Region ? a Concept of Social and Economic Development till 2025 and St Petersburg ? a Strategy- 2030. The paper is considering main provisions of these documents and key problems which needs a coordinated approach: 1) relocation of industrial enterprises from the city centre to the region 2) relocation of the part of logistical and transportation operations from St Petersburg to Leningrad Region 3) development of Greater St Petersburg See Port facilities 4) coordinated development of recreational zones 5) transformation of gardening cooperatives ("sadovodstva") into regular settlements (municipalities) with all necessary infrustructure 6) development and financing a system of <b>suburban</b> <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> 7) environmental issues, including solid waste treatment 8) mass housing construction in the region at the border of St Petersburg etc. On the basis of the analysis of statistics and international best practices recommendations are formulated to improve the efficiency of the governance of the region, paying special attention to St Petersburg Metropolitan Area, which includes a number of municipalities, located in Leningrad Oblast...|$|E

Generally, the comfort and quality of the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> fleet is poor, and many of the vehicles are dilapidated and dirty. Whereas those who can least afford to travel may be prepared to suffer such indignities, people who can pay to travel by their own vehicles, or by taxi, would seldom find any temptation to use public. Increasingly, patronage will be confined to the poorest members of society, thereby further eroding service levels and comfort.
