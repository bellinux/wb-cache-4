5|$|The Caltech–MIT rivalry is {{a college}} rivalry between California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), {{stemming}} from the colleges' reputations as the top science and engineering schools in the United States.

5|$|Today {{close to}} 150 pre-university {{educational}} institutions operate in Cluj-Napoca, including 62 kindergartens, 30 primary schools and 45 high <b>schools.</b> <b>Their</b> activity is supervised by the County Board for Education.

George Coșbuc and Onisifor Ghibu high schools with Romanian/German classes and Romanian/Hungarian classes, respectively. Statistics show that 18,208 students {{were enrolled in the}} city's secondary school system during the 1993–94 school year, while a further 7,660 attended one of the 18 professional schools. In the same year, another 37,111 pupils and 9,711 children were registered for primary and pre-school, respectively.|$|E

25|$|The Hamilton Board of Education resumed its ambitious {{building}} {{program for}} <b>schools.</b> <b>Their</b> names often honoured {{the memory of}} war veterans: Memorial School, Allenby School and Earl Kitchener School.

25|$|The Byberry Friends Meeting, a Quaker meeting house, {{was located}} {{across the street}} from the Purvis house. The Purvis {{children}} attended the Byberry Friend School. Also nearby was the Friends' Library Company and Philosophical Society and Purvis Hall, which was built by Robert Purvis in 1846 and was a meeting location for anti-slavery meetings and other community activities. Robert Purvis refused to pay the local school tax in 1853, since his children would not be afforded an education in the <b>schools.</b> <b>Their</b> children were educated by private tutors and at Quaker schools. Harriet and her husband founded the Gilbert Lyceum.|$|E

25|$|Language (and {{especially}} spoken language) is {{not necessarily}} linked with national identification. Family ties and informal local contact across the border used to be very common, with South Jutlandic being the first language of both Danish minded and German minded people. Sometimes the purest South Jutlandic may be found among older people who identify as German. Since they have not attended Danish <b>schools,</b> <b>their</b> speech is not influenced by Standard Danish. With urbanisation in the recent decades this crisscross of dialects and national sentiment has faded, High German becoming the first choice everywhere, but often some South Jutlandic words are retained in the vocabulary.|$|E
25|$|However, on 29 April 2004 the Ministry of Education {{permitted}} {{three new}} international schools {{to be set}} up without permission being needed to admit Singapore students. These schools must follow the compulsory policies set by the Ministry such as playing the national anthem and taking the pledge every morning, as well as following the nation's policies on bilingualism. These schools – Anglo-Chinese School (International), Hwa Chong International School and SJI International School – are private schools run by the boards of other locally renowned institutions. The school fees are 15 to 20 percent lower than those of foreign international <b>schools.</b> <b>Their</b> intake includes students from countries such as Malaysia, India, Indonesia, People's Republic of China, Taiwan, South Korea, Philippines, Vietnam, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|In March 1888, after {{prolonged}} political infighting, Carol I {{turned his}} back on both the Conservatives and the National Liberals. The Junimists experienced a moment of triumph, with Theodor Rosetti as Premier and Maiorescu as Education Minister. For a while, Melik himself was Secretary General of the Education Ministry, his position at University filled in by I. D. Rallet. The Junimist loyalist was assigned by Maiorescu to inspect the Moldavian <b>schools.</b> <b>Their</b> common goal was to purge from the schooling system a new political threat: socialist activists. Melik was ordered to work only with the known anti-socialists, and to sack all those suspected of having affiliated with the socialist clubs. In one such letter, the Minister instructs his subordinate to inquire about whether the known Marxist Ioan Nădejde still had relatives working on a state salary.|$|E

25|$|American {{public school}} systems, {{especially}} in large metropolitan areas, {{to a large}} extent are still de facto segregated. Whether due to Brown, or due to Congressional action, or due to societal change, the percentage of black students attending majority-black school districts decreased somewhat until the early 1980s, at which point that percentage began to increase. By the late 1990s, the percentage of black students in mostly minority school districts had returned to about what it was in the late 1960s. In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 (2007), the Court held that, if a school system became racially imbalanced due to social factors other than governmental racism, then the state is not as free to integrate schools as if the state had been at fault for the racial imbalance. This is especially evident in the charter school system where parents of students can pick which <b>schools</b> <b>their</b> children attend based on the amenities provided by that school and the needs of the child. It seems that race is a factor in the choice of charter school.|$|E
25|$|That year, Harvard {{sent its}} varsity team to Poughkeepsie to race Cornell, Pennsylvania, and Columbia {{in the annual}} Intercollegiate Rowing Association Regatta. Courtney’s team beat all three schools {{with a time of}} 19 minutes and 22.9 seconds for the four mile (6km) course. The next year, Harvard and Yale ended their dispute when Walter Camp {{representing}} Yale agreed to Harvard's demands for the next five years. One of Harvard’s demands was that they meet in all athletics that each school sponsored. Yale had wanted to be selective on which teams played each other. As part of an agreement between the two <b>schools,</b> <b>their</b> rowing teams were to meet in Poughkeepsie, New York during the 1897 season. Since Harvard had already agreed to meet Cornell they were also included. Even given their past success, Courtney and his crew were given little chance to win a race against Harvard and Yale. The coaches of both of his opponents were on record that they both would beat Cornell. Gamblers and bookmakers made Cornell a heavy underdog. Newspaper writers before the meet said that Cornell was not in the same class as Harvard and Yale. They also criticized Cornell’s stroke as weak and in bad form. Even with the odds stacked against Cornell, Courtney believed his team could win, especially after seeing his competition row in practice. Courtney believed that losing would mean the end of Cornell's fight for recognition.|$|E

2500|$|According to Moss, {{socioeconomic}} {{factors that}} affect impoverished populations such as education, income inequality, and occupation, represent the strongest and most consistent predictors of health and mortality. [...] The inequalities in the apparent circumstances of individual's lives, like individuals' access to health care, <b>schools,</b> <b>their</b> conditions of work and leisure, households, communities, towns, or cities, affect people's ability to lead a flourishing life and maintain health, according to the WHO. The inequitable distribution of health-harmful living conditions, experiences, and structures, is {{not by any means}} natural, [...] "but {{is the result of a}} toxic combination of poor social policies and programmes, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics". Therefore, the conditions of individual's daily life are responsible for the social determinants of health and a major part of health inequities between and within countries. Along with these social conditions, [...] "Gender, education, occupation, income, ethnicity, and place of residence are all closely linked to people's access to, experiences of, and benefits from health care." [...] Social determinants of disease can be attributed to broad social forces such as racism, gender inequality, poverty, violence, and war. This is important because health quality, health distribution, and social protection of health in a population affect the development status of a nation. Since health has been considered a fundamental human right, one author suggests the social determinants of health determine the distribution of human dignity.|$|E
