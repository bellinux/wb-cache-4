50|$|The Astral {{propagation}} model is an underwater sound propagation loss model. It {{began as a}} model for predicting range-smoothed (over 30-40 nm) propagation loss (PL) in a range dependent environment in the late 1970s and was developed by C. W. Spoffard. A convergence zone and <b>surface</b> <b>duct</b> capability was added in the mid-1980s, after which it underwent testing by the US Navy along with range dependent Raymode and the Parabolic Equation (PE) model. As a result of these tests, ASTRAL became one of the official US Navy's range dependent PL models along with PE.|$|E
50|$|At equator and {{temperate}} latitudes in the ocean, {{the surface}} temperature is {{high enough to}} reverse the pressure effect, such that a sound speed minimum occurs at depth {{of a few hundred}} metres. The presence of this minimum creates a special channel known as Deep Sound Channel, previously known as the SOFAR (sound fixing and ranging) channel, permitting guided propagation of underwater sound for thousands of kilometres without interaction with the sea surface or the seabed. Another phenomenon in the deep sea is the formation of sound focusing areas, known as Convergence Zones. In this case sound is refracted downward from a near-surface source and then back up again. The horizontal distance from the source at which this occurs depends on the positive and negative sound speed gradients. A <b>surface</b> <b>duct</b> can also occur in both deep and moderately shallow water when there is upward refraction, for example due to cold surface temperatures. Propagation is by repeated sound bounces off the surface.|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{conditions}} that affect atmospheric electromagnetic <b>surface</b> <b>ducts</b> in the Aegean Sea region and how those conditions are related to regional and global scale climate variations. As a primary source for our calculations, we used radiosonde soundings from three different stations situated around the Aegean Sea, analyzing a 20 -year period, from 1991 to 2010. We derived statistics on ducting parameters and correlated them with the seasonal means of selected climate system variables. We focused on seasonal and interannual variations in <b>surface</b> <b>ducting</b> frequency, height, and strength gradient. We found that variations in low level atmospheric moisture were a dominant factor governing variations in <b>surface</b> <b>ducting</b> conditions. The moisture variations were mainly associated with fluctuations in (1) moisture advection associated with mid-latitude cyclones in winter; and (2) local and regional evaporation in summer. The frequency of <b>surface</b> <b>ducts</b> in the summer was twice that for the winter due to larger amounts of atmospheric moisture in the summer. Variations in large-scale subsidence {{did not seem to}} significantly affect <b>surface</b> <b>ducting</b> variations. From an interannual perspective, the years that were characterized by increased moisture amounts also tended to exhibit stronger and more frequent ducting conditions for both winter and summer. We found significant correlations between Aegean <b>surface</b> <b>ducting</b> conditions and (1) local and regional moisture(r = 0. 85 with significance level p = 99 %); and,(2) climate variations that affect local and regional moisture, such as those associated with the Arctic Oscillation (AO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and south Asian monsoon conditions (r 0. 60 with p 95 %). As a by-product, we also discovered significant correlations (ranging from r = 0. 67 to r = 0. 96 with p 95 %) between ducting parameters and the vertical resolution of the radiosonde data, indicating that differences in data collection procedures need to be accounted for when conducting ducting analyses based on radiosonde data.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{environmental}} impact on radio wave propagation of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and coastal radar systems in the operational area of the Netherlands Coastguard, i. e., the exclusive economical zone (EEZ) of the Netherlands. In {{this part of the}} North Sea, the coastguard monitors marine traffic to maintain a safe and secure environment. For their situation awareness, they are depending on (Class A) AIS and (X-band) radar. However, the operators of these sensor systems often experience abnormal effects such as coverage gaps and different detection ranges for AIS and radar. An important and strongly fluctuating cause of these effects is {{the environmental impact}} on radio wave propagation. Therefore, the weather conditions on the North Sea and the impact of these different conditions are analysed and modelled. In general, five common propagation conditions are known: standard atmosphere, evaporation <b>ducts,</b> standard <b>surface</b> <b>ducts,</b> surface-based ducts, and elevated ducts. The effects of these conditions and their occurrences on the North Sea were studied for AIS and radar. It was found that elevated and <b>surface</b> <b>ducts</b> - most prominent during spring and summer - extend both AIS and radar detection ranges, whereas evaporation ducts - strongest at the end of summer - were found to only extend radar detection ranges. Standard atmospheric conditions lead, for both systems, to minimum detection ranges. The modelling in this thesis is a proof of concept for the coastguard to make a forecast of the coverage of their systems on a daily basis, by using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) data. Such a daily forecast will support the coastguard in the deployment of mobile detection units, such as ships and aircraft. The modelling also enables operators to understand why targets appear either on AIS or radar, thus preventing that signals are wrongly considered false or suspicious...|$|R

40|$|This work {{takes an}} in depth look at {{acoustic}} propagation through double duct sound speed profiles in the Arctic. While the traditional Arctic sound speed profile {{has a single}} <b>surface</b> <b>duct,</b> some portions of the Arctic have a sound speed profile which includes a second, lower duct. These double duct systems are seen through out the Beaufort Sea, dating back to 2004, in data made available by the Ice-Tethered Profiler program at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institutes. The acoustic propagation through the double duct system is analyzed using normal mode analysis, through the Kraken normal mode code. A simulated lower duct is introduced in order to isolate only those modes which travel within the lower duct. Propagation through the lower duct is compared to propagation in traditional Arctic sound speed profiles, and for certain ducts distinct increases in propagation strength are shown. by Thomas Howe.

40|$|In {{this study}} a model {{predicting}} {{the electromagnetic wave propagation}} has been developed. The model is initialized with a known refractivity profile and an initial transmitted field. The troposphere {{is assumed to}} be inhomogeneous in height and range. The vertical refractivity profile is computed from the meteorological upper air data.

A storm can drive up the ambient noise levels, eliminate a thermocline by wind mixing, and whip up violent waves and thereby break up the acoustic mirror formed by theocean surface.

There is dramatic variation in performance (measured by bit error rates) between receivers in the <b>surface</b> <b>duct</b> and receivers in the thermocline. To interpret the performance variations in a quantitative way, a precise metric is introduced based on a signal-to-interference-noise ratio that encompasses both the ambient noise and intersymbol interference.

The SMG-WOD for the region of interest in this study has 0. 25 °× 0. 25 ° horizontal resolutions, 28 vertical levels from the surface to 3000 -meter depth, one-month temporal increment from January 1960 to December 2014. It provides the long-term spatial and temporal variability of the (T, S) and sound speed profile data. However, the GDEM offers climatological monthly mean (T, S) data with 0. 25 horizontal resolution and 78 vertical depths from the surface to 6600 meters. Five distinct points were chosen in order to model acoustic propagation to account for significant differences in mean salinity, temperature vertical profiles and bottom sediments between sub-basins.

In this thesis, more than 13000 vertical profiles from GPS-enabled dropsondes, recorded from 1996 through 2010, were analyzed {{to determine the}} characteristics of electromagnetic and electro-optical ducting in the boundary layer, an environmental condition that significantly affects the propagation of radio waves. A radio wave propagation duct is formed when there are significant gradients in the humidity and temperature profiles of the atmosphere. In this study, the frequency of occurrence and the characteristics (height, depth, and strength) of a duct are identified using the temperature and humidity profiles measured by dropsondes. The identified ducts are separated based on duct types occurring in the lower troposphere: <b>surface</b> <b>ducts,</b> surface-based ducts, and elevated ducts.

This model is no longer supported by SPAWARS or any other group and has been replaced; it is obsolete. This model is able to represent some realistic features including: (1) decrease in signal strength (increase in propagation loss) with range, (2) more interference lobes for higher elevation and higher frequency transmitters, and (3) increased surface ranges for evaporation and <b>surface</b> <b>ducts,</b> and also with greater K-Factors. However the following deficiencies were noted: 1. Duct Strength (M value change) had no effect on the JSAF predictions. 2. The JSAF interference lobes caused by interaction between direct and surface-reflected radiation did not have the correct spacing [...] 3. The effects of <b>surface</b> <b>ducts</b> were not realistically modeled. In reality, ducts create complex signal strength patterns and at the surface typically show “skip and hop” bands of increased and decreased signal strength. The JSAF predictions were unrealistically smooth and showed no skip patterns. 4. The far range (> 30 km) JSAF predictions appeared to have too strong signals and very simplified “flat” patterns. It appears that the JSAF EM model was not designed for these regions. 5. The standalone version used in this had no consideration for geographic location for predicting duct effects. Other versions do allow duct features to vary strongly over the Earth’s surface. 6. The varying “leakage’ of radiation above ducts was not captured by the JSAF predictions. 7.

40|$|In shallow water, {{reverberation}} {{data can}} often be used to extract information about bottom properties. A forward model is needed to compute replica traces for given bottom properties, and an inversion algorithm is needed to match measured and modelled data. Emphasis is here given to cases with bottom depths around 250 m and sonar frequencies around 1500 Hz. The forward model needs to be accurate and fast enough. A ray model is chosen, that accommodates back-scattering kernels of empirical Lambert {{as well as physical}} SPM (small perturbation theory) types. The accuracy is evaluated by comparisons to a normal-mode reverberation model. Satisfactory agreement is typically obtained, although mismatch for soft bottom cases with energy carried by an isolated <b>surface</b> <b>duct</b> mode is also noted. Lambert’s law is separable as concerns incidence and scattering angle factors, which is important for computational efficiency in connection with inversion. The SPM kernel is not separable, however, but separable approximations are developed. They are accurate at small to moderate grazing angles and enhance computational speed significantly. Scatter plots, showing for each parameter misfit for all forward model runs, are presented for differential evolution inversion examples. As is also apparent from an inspection of the kernel, the SPM parameters for roughness height and correlation length are difficult to determine independently. Rather than exhibiting a wide spread of possible values, however, the scatter plots may get side tracked to erroneous solutions.

40|$|PURPOSE: This work {{presents}} an improved algorithm for {{the generation of}} 3 D breast software phantoms and its evaluation for mammography. METHODS: The improved methodology has evolved from a previously presented 3 D noncompressed breast modeling method used {{for the creation of}} breast models of different size, shape, and composition. The breast phantom is composed of breast <b>surface,</b> <b>duct</b> system and terminal ductal lobular units, Cooper 2 ̆ 7 s ligaments, lymphatic and blood vessel systems, pectoral muscle, skin, 3 D mammographic background texture, and breast abnormalities. The key improvement is {{the development of a new}} algorithm for 3 D mammographic texture generation. Simulated images of the enhanced 3 D breast model without lesions were produced by simulating mammographic image acquisition and were evaluated subjectively and quantitatively. For evaluation purposes, a database with regions of interest taken from simulated and real mammograms was created. Four experienced radiologists participated in a visual subjective evaluation trial, as they judged the quality of the simulated mammograms, using the new algorithm compared to mammograms, obtained with the old modeling approach. In addition, extensive quantitative evaluation included power spectral analysis and calculation of fractal dimension, skewness, and kurtosis of simulated and real mammograms from the database. RESULTS: The results from the subjective evaluation strongly suggest that the new methodology for mammographic breast texture creates improved breast models compared to the old approach. Calculated parameters on simulated images such as beta exponent deducted from the power law spectral analysis and fractal dimension are similar to those calculated on real mammograms. The results for the kurtosis and skewness are also in good coincidence with those calculated from clinical images. Comparison with similar calculations published in the literature showed good agreement in the majority of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The improved methodology generated breast models with increased realism compared to the older model as shown in evaluations of simulated images by experienced radiologists. It is anticipated that the realism will be further improved using an advanced image simulator so that simulated images may be used in feasibility studies in mammography...|$|E

Radar ranges beyond the horizon were observed very frequently {{during the summer months}} - on more than half the observations. On the other hand, no evidence of extended range performance was observed during the winter. Most of the occasions when abnormal ranges occurred were the result of trapping of the electomagnetic wave in an atmosphere duct close to the lake surface. On these occasions the greatest range was obtained with the radar less than 100 feet above the lake surface. There was a marked maximum in the occurance of these <b>surface</b> <b>ducts</b> in the afternoon, and it generally was observed that they occur when the air temperature exceeds the water temperature. The presence of rain on the propagation path reduced the frequency of occurrence of extended ranges by, at least, a factor of three. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Rounded {{shoulder}} on bushing ensures repeatable stop position. Improved {{stop mechanism}} allows airflow slot on circulation-control airfoil {{to be limited}} to precise width. Shoulder bushing installed in duct so shoulder rests on inside <b>surface</b> of <b>duct.</b> Bolt slides in bushing in duct wall between more open and less open positions. No relative motion or wear between bolt and slot panel. Prevents bushing from being dislodged by stop forces and provides stiffer stopping surface than sleeve bushing bonded in duct wall...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} type {{consists}} of a single 7 to 8 ft post driven into the ground, {{so that it is}} approximately shoulder height. The post is tapered from the bottom to a thickness of 1 cm at the top. Traditionally, a pad of rice straw (巻 maki [...] "roll" [...] + 藁 wara [...] "straw") was bound to the top with rope to form a striking <b>surface.</b> However, <b>duct</b> tape and foam rubber padding will work just fine, and last longer outdoors.|$|R
