5|$|Some USB devices {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by the specifications for a <b>single</b> <b>port.</b> This is common for external hard and optical disc drives, and generally for devices with motors or lamps. Such devices can use an external power supply, which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.|$|E
25|$|The {{specification}} {{recommends that}} RTP port numbers are {{chosen to be}} even and that each associated RTCP port be the next higher odd number. However, a <b>single</b> <b>port</b> is chosen for RTP and RTCP in applications that multiplex the protocols. RTP and RTCP typically use unprivileged UDP ports (1024 to 65535), but may also use other transport protocols, most notably, SCTP and DCCP, as the protocol design is transport independent.|$|E
25|$|Some {{personalized}} tourniquet systems use {{a sophisticated}} “dual-port” system {{which gives the}} most accurate control of cuff pressure and the fastest response to pressure changes. In a dual-port system, each cuff bladder has two ports and {{is connected to the}} personalized instrument using two hoses. One port is for monitoring the pressure (“sensing port”); the other port is for inflating and deflating the cuff and for automatically supplying and releasing small amounts of gas during use to control cuff pressure (“supply port”). In some more basic systems, a <b>single</b> <b>port</b> performs both functions for each cuff bladder. Single-port tourniquet systems are less accurate than dual-port tourniquet systems.|$|E

25|$|The Virginia Port Authority had {{its roots}} in the Virginia State Ports Authority, an agency of the Commonwealth created in 1952 that was {{responsible}} for operating the port terminals in the Hampton Roads harbor. Studies commissioned by the Virginia General Assembly during the 1970s and the early 1980s suggested that the port terminals should be consolidated under a <b>single</b> <b>port</b> authority that would manage the activities of the terminals while remaining under the authority of the General Assembly. Legislation changed the name of the Virginia State Ports Authority to the Virginia Port Authority to reflect the goal of integrating the ports. Virginia Senate Bill 548 mandated that the Virginia Port Authority complete the unification as swiftly as possible. In addition, the General Assembly revised the VPA’s enabling legislation to allow the agency to subordinate local port cities, towns, and other entities; to acquire federal, state, and local property; and to provide for a tariff.|$|E
500|$|Where devices (for example, {{high-speed}} disk drives) {{require more}} power than a high-power device can draw, they function erratically, if at all, from bus power of a <b>single</b> <b>port.</b> USB provides for these devices as being self-powered. However, such devices may come with a Y-shaped cable that has two USB plugs (one for power and data, the other for only power), so as to draw power as two devices. Such a cable is non-standard, with the USB compliance specification stating that [...] "use of a 'Y' cable (a cable with two A-plugs) is prohibited on any USB peripheral", meaning that [...] "if a USB peripheral requires {{more power than}} allowed by the USB specification {{to which it is}} designed, then it must be self-powered." ...|$|E
500|$|In general, USB cables {{have only}} plugs on their ends, while hosts and devices have only receptacles. Hosts almost universally have Type-A receptacles, while devices {{have one or}} another Type-B variety. Type-A plugs mate only with Type-A receptacles, and {{the same applies to}} their Type-B counterparts; they are {{deliberately}} physically incompatible. However, an extension to the USB standard specification called USB On-The-Go (OTG) allows a <b>single</b> <b>port</b> to act as either a host or a device, which is selectable {{by the end of the}} cable that plugs into the receptacle on the OTG-enabled unit. Even after the cable is hooked up and the units are communicating, the two units may [...] "swap" [...] ends under program control. This capability is meant for units such as PDAs in which the USB link might connect to a PC's host port as a device in one instance, yet connect as a host itself to a keyboard and mouse device in another instance.|$|E

60|$|I {{introduced}} this digression with an apology, yet have extended {{it so much}} further than I had designed, that I must once more request my reader to excuse me. It {{was to be expected}} (I have said) that Lord Nelson would appreciate the isle of Malta from its relations to the British fleet on the Mediterranean station. It was the fashion of the day to style Egypt the key of India, and Malta the key of Egypt. Nelson saw the hollowness of this metaphor; or if he only doubted its applicability in the former instance, he was sure that it was false in the latter. Egypt might or might not be the key of India, but Malta was certainly not the key of Egypt. It was not intended to keep constantly two distinct fleets in that sea; and the largest naval force at Malta would not supersede the necessity of a squadron off Toulon. Malta does not lie in the direct course from Toulon to Alexandria; and from the nature of the winds (taking one time with another) the comparative length of the voyage to the latter port will be found far less than a view of the map would suggest, and in truth of little practical importance. If it were the object of the French fleet to avoid Malta in its passage to Egypt, the port-admiral at Valetta would in all probability receive his first intelligence of its course from Minorca or the squadron off Toulon, instead of communicating it. In what regards the refitting and provisioning of the fleet, either on ordinary or extraordinary occasions, Malta was as inconvenient as Minorca was advantageous, not only from its distance (which yet was sufficient to render it almost useless in cases of the most pressing necessity, as after a severe action or injuries of tempest), but likewise from the extreme difficulty, if not impracticability of leaving the harbour of Valetta with a NW. wind, which often lasts for weeks together. In all these points his lordship's observations were perfectly just; and it must be conceded by all persons acquainted with the situation and circumstances of Malta, that its importance, as a British possession, if not exaggerated on the whole, was unduly magnified in several important particulars. Thus Lord Minto, in a speech delivered at a county meeting, and afterwards published, affirms, that supposing (what no one could consider as unlikely to take place) that the court of Naples should be compelled to act under the influence of France, and that the Barbary powers were unfriendly to us, either in consequence of French intrigues or from their own caprice and insolence, there would not be a <b>single</b> <b>port,</b> harbour, bay, creek, or roadstead in the whole Mediterranean, from which our men-of-war could obtain a single ox or a hogshead of fresh water, unless Great Britain retained possession of Malta. The noble speaker seems not to have been aware, that under the circumstances supposed by him, Odessa too being closed against us by a Russian war, the island of Malta itself would be no better than a vast almshouse of 75,000 persons, exclusive of the British soldiery, all of whom must be regularly supplied with corn and salt meat from Great Britain or Ireland. The population of Malta and Gozo exceeds 100,000, while the food of all kinds produced on the two islands would barely suffice for one-fourth of that number. The deficit is procured by the growth and spinning of cotton, for which corn could not be substituted from the nature of the soil, or, were it attempted, would produce but a small proportion of the quantity which the cotton raised on the same fields and spun into thread, enables the Maltese to purchase, not to mention that the substitution of grain for cotton would leave half of the inhabitants without employment. As to live stock, it is quite out of the question, if we except the pigs and goats, which perform the office of scavengers in the streets of Valetta and the towns {{on the other side of}} the Porto Grande.|$|E
