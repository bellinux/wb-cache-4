30|$|The {{method of}} {{separated}} gas and power system <b>expansion</b> <b>planning</b> (EP) is briefly clarified here for better understanding. As {{we can see}} from Fig.  1, there are three parts in total: the upper part denotes gas transmission <b>expansion</b> <b>planning</b> elements in future time; the middle part denotes coupled elements in the ECP framework and the market interaction; the lower part denotes power transmission <b>expansion</b> <b>planning</b> elements in future time. In the situation of EP framework, the middle part is eliminated, and only {{the upper and lower}} parts are kept. The gas transmission <b>expansion</b> <b>planning</b> aims to determine the size and location of pipelines, compressor stations, and storage facilities, while the power <b>expansion</b> <b>planning</b> tries to find the idea size and location of transmission lines, transformers, etc. These processes are conducted separately without considering coupled load centers and coupled generation centers. For detailed EP method, please refer to the upper/lower part in Fig.  1.|$|R

40|$|Before the {{deregulation}} of the electric industry, a vertically integrated utility made planning decisions for both the generation system and the transmission system according to reliability criteria. The {{deregulation of the}} electric industry has resulted in an unbundling of the long-term planning function for generation and transmission systems. In the deregulated world, transmission planning {{is different from that}} in the regulated environment. In this study, we present a market-based transmission <b>expansion</b> <b>planning</b> model and compare it with a traditional reliability-based transmission planning model. Reliability-based transmission planning tries to install new lines at minimal cost while fulfilling system reliability criteria. Market-based transmission planning, on the other hand, seeks investment opportunities so that network expansions can generate more economic benefits than the costs. Benders decomposition technique is employed in both methods, and their master problems and slave problems are compared, respectively. The scalability of the market-based transmission planning algorithm is also discussed. Various uncertainties occur in the planning process. Uncertainties appearing in the planning process are analyzed systematically and classified into random and non-random uncertainties. Monte Carlo simulation method is applied to simulate random uncertainties, while robustness testing method is employed to incorporate non-random uncertainties. Most planning optimization tools optimize generation <b>expansion</b> <b>plans</b> under an assumed transmission <b>expansion</b> <b>plan,</b> or they optimize transmission <b>expansion</b> <b>plans</b> under an assumed generation <b>expansion</b> <b>plan.</b> In practice, engineers typically find optimal transmission <b>expansion</b> <b>plans</b> for various generation expansion futures, often iterating between generation planning and transmission planning results, settling on those transmission <b>expansion</b> <b>plans</b> which are needed under most or all of the generation expansion futures. Inadequately accounting for the interdependency between the two planning processes may result in suboptimal investment decisions and lost economic benefits. In this article, the interactions between large-scale wind integration and transmission system planning are analyzed, and a new computational procedure of system <b>expansion</b> <b>planning</b> that coordinates generation and transmission investment is proposed...|$|R
