25|$|While in {{principle}} the acceptable level of statistical significance {{may be subject}} to debate, the p-value is the smallest <b>significance</b> <b>level</b> that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis. This is logically equivalent to saying that the p-value is the probability, assuming the null hypothesis is true, of observing a result at least as extreme as the test statistic. Therefore, the smaller the p-value, the lower the probability of committing type I error.|$|E
25|$|Hypothesis testing {{provides}} a means of finding test statistics used in significance testing. The concept of power is useful in explaining the consequences of adjusting the <b>significance</b> <b>level</b> and is heavily used in sample size determination. The two methods remain philosophically distinct. They usually (but not always) produce the same mathematical answer. The preferred answer is context dependent. While the existing merger of Fisher and Neyman–Pearson theories has been heavily criticized, modifying the merger to achieve Bayesian goals has been considered.|$|E
25|$|A {{difference}} {{that is highly}} statistically significant can still be of no practical significance, {{but it is possible}} to properly formulate tests to account for this. One response involves going beyond reporting only the <b>significance</b> <b>level</b> to include the p-value when reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected or accepted. The p-value, however, does not indicate the size or importance of the observed effect and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies. A better and increasingly common approach is to report confidence intervals. Although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or p-values, they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it.|$|E

40|$|In {{randomized}} experiments, it {{is sometimes}} important to demonstrate that two treatments do not differ greatly in their effects, or {{to demonstrate that the}} treatments have very different effects on one outcome but similar effects on another outcome. These ‘‘demonstrations’’ may take the form of rejecting a null hypothesis of inequivalence in an equivalence test, or rejecting a null hypothesis of equal and inequivalent effects on two outcomes. The procedures often express a complex hypothesis in terms of component hypotheses, and combine the component <b>significance</b> <b>levels</b> to test the complex hypothesis. If used in a randomized trial, randomization provides valid <b>significance</b> <b>levels</b> for each component test, and hence also for the combined procedure. In an observational study—that is, in a study of treatments that were not randomly assigned—there is typically concern that <b>significance</b> <b>levels</b> for testing hypotheses about treatment effects may be distorted by failure to control for some unobserved pretreatment covariate. This concern is raised in the evaluation of virtually all obser-vational studies. The possible impact of such an unobserved covariate is clarified and displayed by a sensitivity analysis that, for various possible magnitudes of potential bias, yields a corresponding interval of possible <b>significance</b> <b>levels.</b> Some observational studies are sensitive to very small unobserved biases, whereas others are insensitive to large biases. Here, existing sensitivity analyses for component hypotheses are used to generate sensitivity analyses for complex hypotheses tested by combining component <b>significance</b> <b>levels.</b> We apply the procedure to our study of the timing of discharges of premature babies from neonatal intensive care units, focusing on the possible impact of delayed discharge on use of unplanned medical care after discharge.

40|$|This paper re-evaluates key past {{results of}} unit root tests, {{emphasizing}} {{that the use}} of a conventional <b>level</b> of <b>significance</b> is not in general optimal due to the test having low power. The decision-based <b>significance</b> <b>levels</b> for popular unit root tests, chosen using the line of enlightened judgement under a symmetric loss function, are found to be much higher than conventional ones. We also propose simple calibration rules for the decision-based <b>significance</b> <b>levels</b> for a range of unit root tests. At the decision-based <b>significance</b> <b>levels,</b> many time series in Nelson and Plosser’s (1982) (extended) data set are judged to be trend-stationary, including real income variables, employment variables and money stock. We also find that nearly all real exchange rates covered in Elliott and Pesavento’s (2006) study are stationary; and that most of the real interest rates covered in Rapach and Weber’s (2004) study are stationary. In addition, using a specific loss function, the U.

2500|$|The p-value {{is widely}} used in {{statistical}} hypothesis testing, specifically in null hypothesis significance testing. In this method, as part of experimental design, before performing the experiment, one first chooses a model (the null hypothesis) and a threshold value for p, called the <b>significance</b> <b>level</b> of the test, traditionally 5% or 1% [...] and denoted as α. If the p-value {{is less than the}} chosen <b>significance</b> <b>level</b> (α), that suggests that the observed data is sufficiently inconsistent with the null hypothesis that the null hypothesis may be rejected. However, that does not prove that the tested hypothesis is true. When the p-value is calculated correctly, this test guarantees that the Type I error rate is at most α. For typical analysis, using the standard α=0.05 cutoff, the null hypothesis is rejected when p < [...]05 and not rejected when p > [...]05. The p-value does not, in itself, support reasoning about the probabilities of hypotheses but is only a tool for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis.|$|E
