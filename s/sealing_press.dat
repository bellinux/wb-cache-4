30|$|The {{denaturation}} temperature (Td) is {{a measure}} of the physiochemical change of the collagen structure within the leather causing disruption of the structure (e.g. by heat or radiation or solvents used for cleaning). Analysis of the denaturation temperature provides information with regards to the temperature at which the collagen triple helix in the leather collapses and is transformed into a random coil. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was applied as a thermoanalytical technique to investigate the hydrothermal stability of the leather and measure the denaturation temperature of the model leather samples (fresh/aged/laser irradiated) [29, 30] as a function of the various conditions to evaluate laser cleaning. This will help assessment of the laser cleaning of the model leather samples because any damage or breakdown of the collagen network should decrease the denaturation temperature [31]. A reduction in the denaturation temperatures is an indicator of the degradation of the triple helix of the collagen molecule. However, various factors such as the type and age of animal skin, tanning material and water content can affect the leather Td [31, 32]. Td measurements were carried out using a Mettler Toledo DSC 822 e calorimeter. The model leather samples (~ 10  mg) were placed in a conditioning room at 20  °C and 60  % relative humidity for a minimum 48  h before measuring Td. The leather samples were hermetically sealed in aluminum pans (40  µl Al pans withstand pressure of up to 0.2  MPa and temperature of up to 640  °C. The crucibles were sealed with a <b>sealing</b> <b>press</b> with a sealer plate and plunger set for standared crucibles. The selected temperature range was 0 – 140  °C and the heating rate was 5  °C min− 1. During heating the fibers will start to shrink at a certain temperature, depend on the stability of the collagen. The DSC was previously calibrated using “Check ʌexo In or ʌexo Zinc” method with Indium/Zinc calibration pans.|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{different}} {{properties of}} experimental particleboard produced using a <b>sealed</b> <b>press</b> were determined and {{were compared with}} those for particleboard produced using a conventional press. Three types of binder, namely urea formaldehyde (UF), melamine formaldehyde (MUF), and polymethylene diphenyl diisocyanate (PMDI), were used for board production. For the UF-bonded boards produced using the <b>sealed</b> <b>press,</b> the modulus of rupture and the internal bond strength (IB) decreased due to the high temperature and steam pressure used {{in comparison to the}} conditions in a conventional press. However, MUF- and PMDI-bonded boards had improved IB and thickness swelling (TS). For the PMDI-bonded boards, especially, the TS was further improved and IB was increased by using a <b>sealed</b> <b>press.</b> PMDI is known to possess superior properties and was confirmed to achieve good properties when used as a binder for particleboards produced using a <b>sealed</b> <b>press.</b>|$|R

30|$|To {{improve the}} {{properties}} of particleboard, boards were produced using a <b>sealed</b> <b>press.</b> With the <b>sealed</b> <b>press,</b> boards were processed under high-temperature and high-pressure steam. This increased the saturation temperature, causing a dramatic rise in temperature inside the board, faster curing of the binder, and a shorter pressing time. The boards were bonded with urea formaldehyde resin, melamine urea formaldehyde resin, or poly(methylene diphenyl diisocyanate) (PMDI). The <b>sealed</b> <b>press</b> improved the internal bond strength and thickness swelling of boards regardless of the binder used during the reduced pressing time. The increased bonding strength improved the board properties, allowing PMDI with a lower resin content {{to be used for}} bonding the boards.|$|R
