50|$|Niuafoou {{was put on}} the European maps by Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire {{during their}} famous circumnavigation of the globe in 1616. After their not so {{successful}} encounter with the islanders of Niuatoputapu, they approached this island with <b>some</b> <b>more</b> <b>hope</b> to find refreshments, so it was called Goede Hoop island. They found black cliffs, green on top, plenty of coconut trees, some houses along the seaside and a whole village near a landing place. But the ship the Eendracht (Unity) could not anchor and they had to limit themselves with some trade with the Indians who came along in their swift canoes. That went on fine for a short while. But when the islanders tried to get away with the small sounding boat, the Dutch had to use fire force again. After this they proceeded with their trip to the west, but veering towards the north and so happened to reach Futuna and Alofi.|$|E

40|$|Hope has {{a special}} {{importance}} for persons with disabilities, who are often overwhelmed with negative emotions of sadness, anxiety and fear of the future. The concept of hope can be determined as inner strength which helps in overcoming the effects of negative life circumstances. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the overall level of hope in three groups of persons with disability, and to establish its relationship with sociodemographic variables. The sample (N= 929) consisted of persons with physical disabilities (N= 351), hearing impairments (N= 337) and visual impairments (N= 241). The following scales were applied: Herth Hope Index (HHI) and Sociodemographic questionnaire. The results indicate that younger participants expressed higher level of hope compared to older participants, women compared to the men, more educated participants had <b>more</b> <b>hope</b> than participants with lower educational level, employed participants and students had <b>more</b> <b>hope</b> than unemployed and retired participants, married and unmarried participants had <b>more</b> <b>hope</b> than divorced and widowed participants, participants who live with a partner, with a partner and children or with parents had <b>more</b> <b>hope</b> than participants who live only with children, and participants with higher income had <b>more</b> <b>hope</b> than participants with lower income. Persons with sensory impairments expressed higher optimism regarding future goals, higher optimism for overcoming problems, and higher optimism for receiving outside support compared to persons with physical disabilities...|$|R
