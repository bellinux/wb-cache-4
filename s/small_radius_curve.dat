40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} {{stability}} problem of {{continuous welded rail}} (short for CWR) on bridge in the <b>small</b> <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> section, a sleeper connector structure was proposed, {{which is used to}} connect sleepers together and strengthen the stability of CWR. A FEM model was established to study the effect of the CWR stability strengthening scheme. This study result shows that the integrity of the track structure and the stability of CWR in the <b>small</b> <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> section of which the radius is from 250 m to 600 m will be both improved by the strengthening scheme, and the larger the curve radius is, the better the CWR stability improvement will be. In order to guarantee the strength of sleeper connector and connecting bolt, it is suggested that the sleeper connectors at beam gaps should not be connected, and small resistance fasteners should be used in strengthening area...|$|E
40|$|This study studied {{an effect}} of a new guard rail on the {{stability}} of curve tracks with CWR and revealed a mechanism of the new guard rail for improving the stability of <b>small</b> <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> tracks with CWR and also analyze the degree of the new guard rail for enlarging the pave range of <b>small</b> <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> tracks with CWR. In order to achieve these, an improved load-deformation method for calculating the stability of tracks with Continuous Welded Rails (CWR) is suggested and verified. The {{results indicate that the}} improved load-deformation method not only has the same accuracy as the improved unified formula in specification, but also has the same clear and simple characteristics as the original load-deformation method. The mechanism of the new guard rail for improving the stability of <b>small</b> <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> tracks with CWR is that the CWR stability can be greatly improved by increasing the stiffness of the track framework under conditions of maintaining the same cross-sectional area of the rails. The CWR with the new guard rail can allow the minimum laying radius from 300 m down to 230 m, i. e., the current specification limit can be relaxed 23. 3 %. If combined with the roadbed strengthening measures, the new guard rail can allow the minimum laying radius from 300 m down to 140 m, i. e., the current specification limit can be further relaxed 53. 3 %...|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} for wheel–rail {{multi-point}} contact {{is presented in}} this paper. In this method, the first- and the second-order derivatives of the wheel–rail interpolation distance function and the elastic wheel–rail virtual penetration are used to determine multiple contact points. The method takes account of the yaw angle of the wheelset and allows the identification of all possible points of contact between wheel and rail surfaces with an arbitrary geometry. Static contact geometry calculations are first carried out using the developed method for both new and worn wheel profiles and with a new rail profile. The validity of the method is then verified by simulations of a coupled vehicle and track system dynamics over a <b>small</b> <b>radius</b> <b>curve.</b> The simulation {{results show that the}} developed method for multi-point contact is efficient and reliable enough to be implemented online for simulations of vehicle–track system dynamics...|$|E
40|$|A time-domain {{model for}} the {{prediction}} of long-term growth of rail roughness (corrugation) on small radius curves is presented. Both low-frequency vehicle dynamics due to curving and high-frequency vehicle–track dynamics excited by short-wavelength rail irregularities are accounted for. The influence of non-Hertzian and non-steady effects in the wheel–rail contact model on rail wear is studied. The model features a contact detection method that accounts for wheelset yaw angle as well as surface irregularities and structural flexibilities of wheelset and rail. The development of corrugation on a <b>small</b> <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> {{is found to be}} highly influenced by the wheel–rail friction coefficient. For vehicle speed 25 km/h and friction coefficient 0. 3, predictions of long-term roughness growth on the low rail show decreasing magnitudes in the entire studied wavelength interval. For friction coefficient 0. 6, roughness growth is found at several wavelengths. The corresponding calculation for the high rail contact of the trailing wheelset indicates no roughness growth independent of friction coefficient.

30|$|Most of {{the above}} studies {{regarded}} wheel as a rigid body when carrying out the wheel wear prediction. However, when the vehicle passed through a <b>small</b> <b>radius</b> <b>curve,</b> the influence of wheel profiles on the wheel–rail normal force, the contact patch size, position of the contact point, adhesion area, {{and the distribution of}} the slide area were different for a flexible wheelset and a rigid wheelset. Chang et al. [17] studied the wheel–rail wear by establishing a three-dimensional dynamic finite element model. Baeza et al. [18] built a model that coupled rotating flexible wheelset and a flexible track model for simulating vehicle–track interaction at high frequencies when investigating growth in rail roughness. Due to the increase of the vehicle speed and the presence of roughness, contact geometry perturbations induce a variation of forces in the vertical and tangential direction, and the torsional vibration of the wheelset axle may, therefore, be excited at high frequency. These vibrations directly affect the contact dynamic action of wheel/rail, and then influence on the wheel profile wear. Therefore, in the prediction of wheel profile wear, wheelset should be considered as flexible body.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of periodic irregularities with distinct wavelengths (corrugation) {{on the low}} rail of small radius curves is studied through mathematical modelling, numerical simulations, field measurements and laboratory investigations. One year of monitoring of roughness on the low rail of a 120  m radius curve on the metro of Stockholm Public Transport (SL) showed severe growth of rail corrugation with wavelengths of about 5  cm and 8  cm. About 300 days after rail grinding, the corrugation was observed to reach a constant amplitude. Based on a section removed from the corrugated rail, a laboratory investigation showed plastic deformation in the lateral direction towards the field side. No significant difference in microstructure was found when corrugation troughs and peaks were compared. A time-domain model for the prediction of long-term roughness growth on curves has been developed and validated versus field measurements. The simulation model is able to simultaneously capture the low-frequency vehicle dynamics due to curving and the high-frequency dynamics due to excitation by for example short-pitch corrugation. Non-Hertzian and non-steady effects in the wheel‒rail contact are considered. Simulations show that the short-pitch corrugation on the <b>small</b> <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> at SL is generated by wear induced by the leading wheelset of passing bogies. The corrugation wavelengths 5  cm and 8  cm {{are determined by the}} excitation of the first antisymmetric and first symmetric bending eigenmodes of the wheelset, respectively. The importance of accounting for the phase difference between the calculated wear and the present rail irregularity in predictions of corrugation growth is demonstrated. Due to a phase difference approaching a low constant value, the growth of corrugation is predicted to eventually develop into a stationary state where it is translated along the rail with a constant amplitude. For track geometry and traffic conditions corresponding to the selected curve at SL, simulations indicate the wheel–rail friction coefficient to have a significant influence on corrugation growth. For friction coefficient 0. 6 (measured at dry contact conditions), corrugation growth is predicted at several wavelengths whereas for friction coefficient 0. 3 (due to application of a friction modifier) it is shown that an initial rail irregularity is gradually worn off by passing traffic. Based on a new set of field measurements in the same curve (another year of monitoring), it was shown that the application of a friction modifier directly after grinding is an effective mitigation measure to prevent the {{development of}} rail corrugation...|$|E

This thesis presents the first stages {{in the development of a}} simulation model for the prediction of rail corrugation growth on <b>small</b> <b>radius</b> <b>curves.</b> By gaining a deeper understanding of the complex dynamic wheel–rail interaction phenomena that lead to corrugation growth, preventive actions may be assessed and implemented. In two separate studies, wear modelling and simulation of dynamic vehicle–track interaction have been considered. A method for the calibration of a wear model using measurement data from a wheel–rail test rig is demonstrated. In terms of worn-off area and profile shape, good quantitative agreement between measured and predicted rail profiles is shown. A time-domain model for the simulation of dynamic interaction between a vehicle and a curved railway track is presented. The simulation model is able to simultaneously capture the low-frequency vehicle dynamics due to curving and the high-frequency track dynamics due to excitation by for example short-pitch corrugation on the low rail. The functionality of the model is demonstrated in several numerical examples. A significant influence of the track and wheelset structural flexibilities on the normal and tangential wheel–rail contact forces is concluded. For a track taken as rigid, the proposed model is validated versus a commercial software.

40|$|M. Ing. Sound {{pressure}} levels exceeding {{acceptable limits}} are being generated by trains travelling on the 1000 m <b>radius</b> <b>curved</b> railway line past {{the town of}} Elands Bay. Unacceptable sound levels are attributed mainly to top of rail wheel squeal. Top of rail wheel squeal belongs {{to the family of}} selfinduced vibrations and originates from frictional instability in curves between the wheel and the rail under predominantly saturated lateral creep conditions. In <b>small</b> <b>radius</b> <b>curves,</b> saturated lateral creep conditions occur due to the steering of railway wheelsets with large angles of attack. Given the large <b>curve</b> <b>radius</b> and the utilisation of self-steering bogies on the Sishen-Saldanha Iron Ore railway line, curve squeal is a highly unexpected result for the 1000 m <b>radius</b> <b>curved</b> railway line. This is because curving of bogies in large <b>radius</b> <b>curves</b> are achieved without high wheelset angles of attack leading to saturated creep conditions. An experimental and analytical investigation was carried out to identify the mechanisms influencing the generation of wheel squeal in large <b>radius</b> <b>curves.</b> Simultaneous measurement of sound pressure and lateral wheel-rail forces were made during regular train service in one of the two 1000 m <b>radius</b> <b>curves</b> at Elands Bay to characterise the bogie curving behaviour for tonal noise due to wheel squeal occurring in the large <b>radius</b> <b>curve.</b> The lateral force curving signature not only reveals the levels of lateral wheel-rail forces required for bogie curving, but also whether the bogie is curving by means of the creep forces generated at the wheel-rail interface only or if contact is necessitated between the wheel flange and rail gauge corner to help steer the bogie around the curve. The test set-up consisted of two free field microphones radially aligned at equivalent distances towards the in – and outside of the curve in line with a set a strain gauge bridges configured and calibrated to measure the lateral and vertical forces on the inner and outer rail of the curve. This test set-up allowed the squealing wheel to be identified from the magnitude difference of the sound pressures recorded by the inner and outer microphones in combination with comparing the point of frequency shift of the squeal event due to the Doppler Effect with the force signals of the radially aligned strain gauge bridges. From the experimental phase of the investigation, it was found that wheel squeal occurring in the 1000 m <b>radius</b> <b>curve</b> at Elands Bay is characteristic of empty wagons and is strongly related to the squealing wheel’s flange/flange throat being in contact with the gauge corner of the rail. Here high levels of spin creepage associated with high contact angles in the gauge corner lead to high levels of associated lateral creepage necessary for squeal generation. This is in contrast to lateral creepage due to high wheelset angles of attack being the key kinematic parameter influencing squeal generation in <b>small</b> <b>radius</b> <b>curves.</b> Furthermore, the amplitude of wheel squeal originating from the passing of empty wagons was found to be inversely proportional to the level of flange rubbing on the squealing wheel i. e. increased flange contact on the squealing wheel brings about a positive effect on squeal control. Contrary to the empty wagons which are characterised by tonal curve squeal, loaded 4 wagons requiring contact between the wheel flange and rail gauge corner in the 1000 m curve was characterised by broadband flanging noise. It was concluded from measurements that flange contact occurring under high lateral forces for steady state curving of loaded wagons provides the complete damping necessary for squeal control. The curve squeal noise that originated from the passing of empty wagons in the Elands Bay curve could further be classified according to the frequency at which the squeal event manifested itself in the curve, i. e. low frequency audible (0 – 10 kHz), high frequency audible (10 – 20 kHz) and ultrasonic squeal (> 20 kHz). The vast majority of low frequency audible squeal events recorded in the 1000 m Elands Bay curve occurred at approximately 4 kHz and originated from the low rail/trailing inner wheel interface, whilst the vast majority of high frequency audible squeal events occurred in the frequency range between 15 and 20 kHz and originated from both the high rail/leading outer wheel and low rail/trailing inner wheel interfaces...|$|R

Within a grinding interval of 1 year, severe short-pitch corrugation was build up with maximum peak-to-peak magnitudes of about 0. 15 mm. Spectral analysis of measurement data shows large roughness magnitudes in the wavelength interval 4 - 14 cm, with peaks at approximately 5 cm and 8 cm. The corrugation pattern has a pure longitudinal direction (with corrugation ridges transverse to the track direction) and an irregularly varying magnitude along the 100 m long measured track section. The roughness growth rate increased with time until 300 days after rail grinding, thereafter only moderate additional roughness growth was observed. Because of moderate train speeds of about 30 km/h, the rolling noise caused by the corrugation has a low-frequency content (< 200 Hz). A 10. 1 dB unit increase (139 - 300 days after grinding) in roughness level in the wavelength interval 4 - 14 cm was found to correspond to an increase in rolling noise level in the frequency interval 60 - 200 Hz of 4. 9 dB.
