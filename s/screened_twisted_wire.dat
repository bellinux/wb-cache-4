40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{analysis}} of drawing square and square <b>twisted</b> <b>wires</b> is presented. The thermomechanical simulation {{of the drawing}} process of square wire was carried out using the viscoplastic body model for a three-dimensional strain state {{with the use of}} Forge 2007 software, while the properties of the material being deformed were described with the Norton-Hoff law. In this paper the distribution of effective strains and longitudinal stresses during changes of the crosssection and <b>twisting</b> of the <b>wires</b> has been demonstrated. It was determined that square <b>twisted</b> <b>wires</b> are characterized by significant inhomogeneity of strain. For verification of obtained numerical results experimental investigation was performed for square and square <b>twisted</b> <b>wire</b> drawing in laboratory conditions. The {{analysis of}} drawing stresses in square <b>twisted</b> <b>wires</b> used for modeling and experimental investigation indicated high material effort, which was much higher than in the case of drawing of square and round wires...|$|R

50|$|<b>Twisted</b> pair <b>wiring</b> - <b>Twisting</b> <b>wires</b> very tightly {{together}} in a circuit will dramatically reduce electromagnetic noise. <b>Twisting</b> the <b>wires</b> decreases the loop size in which a magnetic field can run through to produce a current between the wires. Even if the <b>wires</b> are <b>twisted</b> very tightly, there may still be small loops somewhere between them, {{but because they are}} twisted the magnetic field going through the smaller loops induces a current flowing in opposite ways in each wire and thus cancelling them out.|$|R

40|$|Fertility and {{abundance}} are important themes of ancient Mesopotamian texts and images. The goddess Inanna and her consort Dumuzi personify these ideas in {{texts of the}} second millennium B. C. E. Excavated by Leonard Woolley in the 1920 s, the Royal Cemetery at Ur dates to the mid third millennium B. C. E. Among the tombs, that of Queen Puabi yielded many ornaments of gold, carnelian, and lapis. Some of the pendants realistically depict identifiable animals. Others are more stylized depictions of clusters of apples, dates, and date inflorescences. Apples and dates are both associated with the goddess Inanna, who is associated with love and fertility. <b>Twisted</b> <b>wire</b> pendants in {{the same group of}} objects are not so readily identified. I propose here that the <b>twisted</b> <b>wire</b> pendants in the Puabi assemblage may literally represent rope, symbolically reference sheep, and narratively evoke the flocks of the shepherd Dumuzi.

40|$|Abstract — To achieve small {{delay and}} low {{crosstalk}} for multiple signal nets with capacitive and inductive coupling, we propose {{in this paper}} a novel interconnect structure, staggered twisted-bundle wires where groups of <b>twisted</b> <b>wires</b> are staggered. This new structure {{is different from the}} previously proposed <b>twisted</b> bundle <b>wires</b> with one group of <b>twisted</b> <b>wires</b> and another group of normal wires. Using accurate circuit models and efficient algorithms to find the worst case noise and delay for comprehensive combinations of signal patterns and a range of arrival times, we assume signal and shielding ratio over 1 : 1 for area reduction and compare the aforementioned two structures to coplanar shielding for signal nets. The staggered twisted-bundle has the smallest worst case delay, up to 20 % and 5 % smaller than the coplanar shielding and twisted bundle, respectively. The staggered twisted bundle also has the smallest worst case noise, up to 6 % and 12 % less than coplanar shielding and twisted bundle. Furthermore, the staggered twisted bundle has the smallest delay/noise variation between signal nets. We conclude that without increasing routing area, the staggered twisted bundle is better than the twisted bundle and coplanar shielding in terms of performance and noise. I...|$|R
