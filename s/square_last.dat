40|$|With the UK {{government}} {{poised to}} trigger Article 50 at any moment, {{the people of}} Northamptonshire are invited to a special event which {{will focus on the}} future of jobs and the economy of the county after the UK leaves the EU. Open to all, the event, entitled ‘Brexit: Jobs and Prosperity – The Voice of Northants’, will see a panel of experts and the audience share their issues, concerns, hopes and ideas surrounding Britain’s exit from the European Union. Organised by the University of Northampton and hosted by the Northamptonshire County Council, this important event will allow people to put aside their political differences and explore ways in which we can drive jobs and economic growth in the county post-Brexit. The evening will include a Question Time-style session, with the audience interacting with the panel, which will include SEMLEP’s Chief Executive Stephen Catchpole, Policy Executive at Northamptonshire Chamber of Commerce, Simon Dishman, the European & International Officer of the Community-TU trade union Rob Sneddon as well as the University of Northampton’s Professor Janet Wilson and Leader of the Northamptonshire County Council Cllr Heather Smith. The Question Master is BBC Radio Northampton presenter, John Griff. The evening will be introduced by the Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire David Laing. There will be time for informal networking with refreshments from 5. 30 pm, with a chance to submit questions for the panel prior to the event. It promises to be a lively as well as highly topical debate, part of a major 'listening and learning' research project being undertaken in the county by the University of Northampton following the Brexit vote last June. It is the first of three planned Question Time-style events, with two more to follow later in the year on a) the social and welfare issues of Brexit and b) democracy and constitutional principles arising from Brexit. Next Tuesday there will be the opportunity to learn about earlier research undertaken by the University in Northampton’s Market <b>Square</b> <b>last</b> Autumn, with a public showing of Northampton’s Why? Map. The Why? Map captures Northampton people’s reasons for being for or against Brexit and is intended to help us all to understand the key issues behind the vote as a whole as we address, in an open, non-partisan way, the consequences and implications of Brexit...|$|E
