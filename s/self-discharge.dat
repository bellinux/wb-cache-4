25|$|Old {{rechargeable}} batteries <b>self-discharge</b> {{more rapidly than}} disposable alkaline batteries, especially nickel-based batteries; a freshly charged nickel cadmium (NiCd) battery loses 10% of its charge in the first 24 hours, and thereafter discharges {{at a rate of}} about 10% a month. However, newer low <b>self-discharge</b> nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries and modern lithium designs display a lower <b>self-discharge</b> rate (but still higher than for primary batteries).|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the Low <b>self-discharge</b> NiMH battery (LSD-NiMH) in 2005 made rechargeable AA and AAA sized batteries more viable for powering LED bicycle lights. Previously, the <b>self-discharge</b> effect of NiCAD and NiMH batteries caused the battery to run down {{over a period of}} weeks or a few months, even when not in use. This was particularly a problem for low powered LED lights, and for users who only used their bicycle lights occasionally. The LSD-NiMH battery greatly reduced the <b>self-discharge</b> effect, allowing the battery to keep its charge for a year or more.|$|E
25|$|Classnbsp&1 ceramic {{capacitors}} have an {{insulation resistance}} {{of at least}} 10nbsp&GΩ, while classnbsp&2 capacitors have at least 4nbsp&GΩ or a <b>self-discharge</b> constant of at least 100nbsp&s. Plastic film capacitors typically have an insulation resistance of 6 to 12nbsp&GΩ. This corresponds to capacitors in the uF range of a <b>self-discharge</b> constant of about 2000–4000nbsp&s.|$|E

25|$|Insulation {{resistance}} {{and thus the}} <b>self-discharge</b> time rate are temperature dependent and decrease with increasing temperature at about 1MΩ per 60°C.|$|E
25|$|Insulation {{resistance}} {{respectively the}} <b>self-discharge</b> constant {{can be reduced}} if humidity penetrates into the winding. It is partially strongly temperature dependent and decreases with increasing temperature. Both decrease with increasing temperature.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{leakage current}} of non-solid e-caps {{is higher than}} current flow over {{insulation}} resistance in ceramic or film capacitors, the <b>self-discharge</b> of modern non-solid electrolytic capacitors with organic electrolytes takes several weeks.|$|E

50|$|The Trillium-class {{freighter}} is {{a series}} of freighters owned by Canada Steamship Lines (CSL). The class is divided into three subclasses; the <b>self-discharging</b> lake freighters, the lake bulk carriers and the Panamax <b>self-discharging</b> bulk carriers. Initially a nine-ship building program, six are operated by Canada Steamship Lines for use on the Great Lakes while a three are operated by CSL Americas for international trade. Two more ships were acquired later for use by CSL Americas.|$|R

25|$|All {{batteries}} gradually <b>self-discharge</b> (whether {{installed in}} a device or not) and dead batteries will eventually leak. Extremely high temperatures can also cause batteries to rupture and leak (such as in a car during summer) as well as decrease the shelf life of the battery.|$|E
25|$|The <b>self-discharge</b> {{constant}} is {{an important}} parameter for the insulation of the dielectric between the electrodes of ceramic and film capacitors. For example, a capacitor {{can be used as}} the time-determining component for time relays or for storing a voltage value as in a sample and hold circuits or operational amplifiers.|$|E
25|$|The {{leakage current}} in non-solid {{electrolytic}} capacitors {{as well as}} in manganese oxide solid tantalum capacitors decreases with voltage-connected time due to self-healing effects. Although electrolytics leakage current is higher than current flow over insulation resistance in ceramic or film capacitors, the <b>self-discharge</b> of modern non solid electrolytic capacitors takes several weeks.|$|E

50|$|ABG Shipyard {{builds a}} range of {{commercial}} vessels. These include self-loading and <b>self-discharging</b> bulk carriers, container ships, floating cranes, split barges, anchor handling tugs, dynamic positioning ships, offshore supply vessels and diving support vessels.|$|R
50|$|Four Trillium-class <b>self-discharging</b> lake freighters and two bulk {{carriers}} were ordered in 2010 {{as part of}} a nine-ship program. The lake freighters were constructed by Chengxi shipyard in Jiangyin, China. They were designed for environmental and operational efficiency.|$|R
25|$|The {{insulation}} resistance {{given in the}} unit MΩ (106 Ohm) {{as well as the}} <b>self-discharge</b> constant in seconds is an important parameter for the quality of the dielectric insulation. These time values are important, for example, when a capacitor is used as timing component for relays or for storing a voltage value as in a sample and hold circuits or operational amplifiers.|$|E
25|$|Batteries {{that are}} stored {{for a long}} period or that are {{discharged}} at {{a small fraction of the}} capacity lose capacity due to the presence of generally irreversible side reactions that consume charge carriers without producing current. This phenomenon is known as internal <b>self-discharge.</b> Further, when batteries are recharged, additional side reactions can occur, reducing capacity for subsequent discharges. After enough recharges, in essence all capacity is lost and the battery stops producing power.|$|E
25|$|The {{leakage current}} drops {{in the first}} minutes after {{applying}} DC voltage. In this time the dielectric oxide layer can repair all weaknesses by building up new layers in a self-healing process. The time it takes leakage current to drop generally depends {{on the kind of}} electrolyte. Solid electrolytes' leakage current drops much faster than in the case of non-solid types, but it remain at a somewhat higher level. Wet electrolytic capacitors with high water contend electrolytes in the first minutes generally have higher leakage current than those with organic electrolyte, but after several minutes they reach the same level. Although the leakage current of electrolytic capacitors is higher compared with the current flow over the insulation resistance at ceramic or film capacitors, the <b>self-discharge</b> of modern non-solid electrolytic capacitors can take several weeks.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{rationalize}} the {{loading and unloading}} of bulk goods, the Deutsche Reichsbahn, before the Second World War, had <b>Self-discharging</b> wagons with lids (Selbstentladewagen mit Klappdeckeln) built. They were designed as saddle wagons which enabled rapid gravity discharge.|$|R
50|$|A {{range of}} funnel-shaped <b>self-discharging</b> wagons is also classed as special wagons. Their {{external}} shape resembles the open hoppers, {{but they have}} an enclosed roof with loading hatches or {{in some other way}} do not fulfil the criteria for a wagon with opening roof.|$|R
50|$|Since 1958, the <b>Self-discharging</b> wagon with swing-roof {{has been}} {{employed}} {{in large numbers}} in Europe. In the transport of hygroscopic bulk commodities, they have fully replaced both the {{wagon with opening roof}} and level floor (see above) as well as the standard covered wagon.|$|R

2500|$|Storing {{electrical}} {{energy in the}} double-layer separates the charge carriers by distance within the pores by distances {{in the range of}} molecules. Over this short distance irregularities can occur, leading to a small exchange of charge carriers and gradual discharge. This <b>self-discharge</b> is called leakage current. Leakage depends on capacitance, voltage, temperature and the chemical stability of the electrode/electrolyte combination. At room temperature leakage is so low that it is specified as time to <b>self-discharge.</b> Supercapacitor <b>self-discharge</b> time is specified in hours, days or weeks. As an example, a 5.5V/F Panasonic [...] "Goldcapacitor" [...] specifies a voltage drop at 20°C from 5.5V to 3V in 600 hours (25 days or 3.6 weeks) for a double cell capacitor.|$|E
30|$|A 22 -year-old {{young man}} {{presented}} with left upper quadrant and chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and intermittent obstipation {{with a background}} of previous lower chest wall stabbings. Computed tomography demonstrated a diaphragmatic hernia containing the splenic flexure of the colon, but he declined treatment and <b>self-discharged.</b> He presented three more times with similar symptoms and <b>self-discharged</b> within a 2 -week period and finally presented dyspnoeic and septic. Computed tomography demonstrated tension faecopneumothorax from the perforated colon. He was taken to theatres and {{found to have a}} 3 -mm perforation at his splenic flexure and underwent a segmental resection of the affected colon, intrathoracic washout, and biological mesh repair of his diaphragmatic hernia. He remained alive and postoperative recovery was uneventful.|$|R
50|$|Three Panamax <b>self-discharging</b> bulk {{carriers}} were ordered {{as part of}} the 2010 nine-ship building program by Canada Steamship Lines. The three vessels were constructed at Chengxi Shipyard in Jiangyin, China along with two others of the same design constructed for Torvald Klaveness of Norway under CSL supervision.|$|R
50|$|G wagons {{were also}} {{frequently}} filled with bulk materials that were {{vulnerable to the}} weather. Special wall attachments were developed, especially for the transportation of grain, with which the side doors could be closed. Today there are <b>self-discharging</b> wagons with opening roofs available {{for this type of}} freight that are quicker to load and unload.|$|R
2500|$|The {{resistance}} of the dielectric is never infinite, leading to some level of DC [...] "leakage current", which contributes to <b>self-discharge.</b> For ceramic capacitors this resistance, placed in parallel with the capacitor in the series-equivalent circuit of capacitors, is called [...] "insulation resistance Rins". The insulation resistance must {{not be confused with}} the outer isolation with respect to the environment.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s, {{developments}} include batteries with embedded electronics such as USBCELL, {{which allows}} charging an AA battery through a USB connector, nanoball batteries {{that allow for}} a discharge rate about 100x greater than current batteries, [...] and smart battery packs with state-of-charge monitors and battery protection circuits that prevent damage on over-discharge. Low <b>self-discharge</b> (LSD) allows secondary cells to be charged prior to shipping.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reason for}} leaks {{is that as}} {{batteries}} discharge — either through usage or gradual <b>self-discharge</b> — the chemistry of the cells changes and some hydrogen gas is generated. [...] This out-gassing increases pressure in the battery. [...] Eventually, the excess pressure either ruptures the insulating seals {{at the end of}} the battery, or the outer metal canister, or both. In addition, as the battery ages, its steel outer canister may gradually corrode or rust, which can further contribute to containment failure.|$|E
5000|$|The vessels have a GT of 43,691 {{tons and}} a DWT of 71,319 tons. The ships are 228.6 m long overall with {{a beam of}} 32.26 m. They have a maximum draught of 13.517 m and a depth of 20.16 m. The bulk {{carriers}} have a hold capacity of [...] and an 80 m boom for <b>self-discharging.</b>|$|R
5|$|Conveyor belts offer a very {{efficient}} method of loading, with standard loading rates varying between 100 and 700tons per hour, although {{the most advanced}} ports can offer rates of 16,000tons per hour. Start-up and shutdown procedures with conveyor belts, though, are complicated and require time to carry out. <b>Self-discharging</b> ships use conveyor belts with load rates of around 1,000tons per hour.|$|R
50|$|The Trillium <b>self-discharging</b> lakers have a {{gross tonnage}} (GT) of 24,430 tons. According to the Miramar Ship Index the vessels have a {{deadweight}} tonnage (DWT) of 37,690 tons. However, on the CSL website, the vessels are stated {{as having a}} GT of 24,430 and DWT of 34,500 tons. According to the Miramar Ship Index Baie Comeau has a gross tonnage (GT) of 32,000 tons.|$|R
