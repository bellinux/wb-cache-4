The second originates above another hamlet in Clent called Walton Pool and flows down to Holy Cross and then on to Broom where it is known as Gallows Brook. The third, and the shortest rises in Yieldingtree, but it supplies several old mill ponds before converging with the main stream just south of Blakedown.|$|R

5000|$|The Third Circuit {{considered}} {{the evidence of}} how Hartford's patent attorneys wrote the article for Clarke, had it published, and then presented it to the Patent Office. It concluded, however, that [...] "sordid as is the story concerning {{the genesis of the}} Clarke article and the deceptive design and use of its spurious authorship, still it does not qualify as after-discovered evidence" [...] in Hartford's infringement suit against Hazel. The court pointed to Hazel's knowledge of the hearsay during the trial in 1929. [...] "Although then so informed, counsel for Hazel-Atlas deliberately chose not to go into the matter of the article's real authorship, fearing that if they should refer to the article (which was not in evidence), they might thereby call attention to the statements therein contained as to the increased production from gob feeders as compared with <b>stream</b> <b>feeders,</b> which could not be successfully refuted." ...|$|R
