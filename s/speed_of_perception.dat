The experiments involved two perception-based matching tasks and two retrieval-based matching tasks. A signal-to-respond methodology was used in all tasks. A stochastic feature-sampling model was applied to the results from individual participants to estimate the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> feature <b>perception</b> and the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> feature information retrieval. Generally, the speed at which dimensions were retrieved was linearly related to the speed at which they were perceived. Features that were quickly perceived were also quickly retrieved.

This finding suggests that the effect of chewing gum is domain specific. The cognitive improvements after a period of chewing gum have been demonstrated to last for 15-20 minutes and decline afterwards.|$|E

To identify the brain mechanisms associated with this effect, we analysed brain oscillations. The mood-induced differences in perception performance were associated with differences in ongoing alpha power (around 10 [*]Hz) before stimulus presentation. Additionally, after stimulus presentation, the better performance during negative mood was associated with enhanced global coordination of neuronal activity of theta oscillations (around 5 [*]Hz). Thus, the effect of mood on the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> conscious <b>perception</b> seems to depend on changes in oscillatory brain activity, rendering the cognitive system more or less sensitive to incoming stimuli...|$|R

DESIGN: Prospective survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 90 medical personnel at a tertiary care hospital in Newcastle, NSW. INTERVENTION: Healthcare professionals were shown two pictures that could be interpreted as depicting either a young or an old person, and a word that could be seen as geometric shapes.

40|$|AbstractErrors in the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> moving visual stimuli {{can occur}} when {{presented}} stimuli are of unequal contrast {{and when they}} appear alongside additional modifier stimuli that move at different speeds. We have examined these misperceptions for chromatic and luminance grating stimuli {{in order to assess}} to what extent these different kinds of motion cue might be utilised in the analysis <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> moving objects. We show that the dependence on contrast <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> matching for luminance and chromatic stimuli is similar over a range <b>of</b> stimulus <b>speeds</b> greater than 4 deg/s. Differences between the contrast dependencies <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> <b>perception</b> for chromatic and luminance stimuli are only evident at slow speeds (< 4 deg/s) and low contrasts. The presence of modifier stimuli can directly influence the perceived speed at both high and low velocities and contrasts. This influence was found to be independent of the modifiers’ chromaticity and was greatest when the modifiers were adjacent to and presented simultaneously with the test and reference stimuli. However, the modifiers were still able to induce measurable changes in perceived speed for increased separations over space and time. Taken together these results indicate that whilst differences do exist in the contrast dependencies <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> <b>perception</b> for chromatic and luminance stimuli, they are evident only for a narrow range of stimulus parameters (i. e. low speed and low contrast). There appears to be ample scope for interactions between chromatic and luminance contrast in speed perception where there is the capacity to pool this information over a relatively broad spatio-temporal extent...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine reliabilities of tests of rigidity and to increase these. Toward this end two preliminary studies were conducted. A number of tests were scored for creative effort by the ratio X/Y where X is the score for a familiar task and Y is the score for a similar but unfamiliar task. By using the inverse of this ratio, Y/X, the reliability of several of the tests was increased. A ratio of the time required to write a word first forward, then backward, was more reliable than a ratio of the number of words written first forward for a given period of time, then backward for the same time. A battery of tests was given to 89 high school senior boys and girls. Tests which had a reliability of. 45 or above were included in a factor analysis study. Three factors were computed by the centroid method. After rotation, Factor A seemed to represent an ability to shift from one response to another or to change from one “set” to another. Factor B represented a speed of reaction, more specifically, a speed of performing an unfamiliar task. Eventually this factor may subdivide into a <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> and speed of motor performance. Factor C was specific to Writing Words tests. It may represent the ability to reverse a normal motor response. Two aspects of rigidity as determined by this study are the speed of reaction of the individual and the ability to change from one set to another. A factor representing an ability to change set found in tests based on the creative effort principle adds to the feasibility of employing mental act phenomena for the study of rigidity.

METHOD: We exposed 76 people to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mph (4. 5, 8. 9, 13. 4, 17. 9, 22. 3, and 26. 8 m/s) winds in randomized orders {{and asked them to}} estimate wind speed and the corresponding risk they felt.

Wind speed perceptions mediated the direct relationship between actual wind <b>speeds</b> and <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> risk (i. e., the greater the perceived wind speed, the greater the perceived risk). The number of tropical cyclones people had experienced moderated the strength of the actual-perceived wind speed relationship; consequently, mediation was stronger for people who had experienced fewer storms.

We measured the effect of contrast on flicker perception and found that contrast manipulations produce opposite effects on perceived drift rate and perceived flicker rate, i. e., reducing contrast increases the apparent temporal frequency of counterphase modulated gratings. This finding argues that, if a temporal frequency-based algorithm underlies speed perception, either flicker and speed perception must not be based on the output of the same mechanism or contrast effects on perceived spatial frequency reconcile the disparate effects observed for perceived temporal frequency and speed...|$|R

Although {{listeners}} may sometimes use changes in distance to estimate speed, there is also good evidence for the direct detection <b>of</b> auditory <b>speed</b> (Carlile & Best, 2002; Freeman et al., 2014; Locke, Leung, & Carlile, 2016; Warren, Zielinski, Green, Rauschecker, & Griffiths, 2002). It is notable that speed estimates in all but the slowest stimulus condition were generally less than the actual <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the stimuli. Recent psychophysical work has also shown an underestimation <b>of</b> auditory <b>speed</b> in a circular pattern around the head (Senna, Parise, & Ernst, 2015). However, the current finding is likely the result of a well-documented difficulty in applying metric labels accurately to speed stimuli rather than a true perceptual underestimation <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> approach (Recarte et al., 2000; Recarte & Nunes, 1996; Triggs & Berenyi, 1982). For example, previous research using the same stimuli required participants to execute a button push when a looming sound source arrived and participants significantly underestimated arrival time indicating a perceived speed that was faster than actual (Neuhoff et al., 2014, 2012; Riskind et al., 2014). Because “labeling” the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> looming sounds is typically not a priority in a natural environment, the primary concern here was to examine relative differences between conditions rather than absolute estimates <b>of</b> <b>speed.</b> Moreover, participants show better accuracy with a motor response than a verbal response in judging looming stimuli (Neuhoff, 2001).|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} computing power, it {{is possible}} to process more complex fluid simulations. However, a gap between increasing data size and our ability to visualize them still remains. Despite the great amount of progress that has been made in the field of flow visualization over the last two decades, a number of challenges remain. Whilst the visualization of 2 D flow has many good solutions, the visualization of 3 D flow still poses many problems. Challenges such as domain coverage, <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> computation, and <b>perception</b> remain key directions for further research. Flow visualization with a focus on surface-based techniques forms the basis of this literature survey, including surface construction techniques and visualization methods applied to surfaces. We detail our investigation into these algorithms with discussions of their applicability and their relative strengths and drawbacks. We review the most important challenges when considering such visualizations. The result is an up-to-date overview of the current state-of-the-art that highlights both solved and unsolved problems in this rapidly evolving branch of research...|$|R
