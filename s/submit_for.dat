5|$|In 1925, Born and Heisenberg {{formulated}} {{the matrix}} mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. On 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born a paper entitled Über quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen ("Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Kinematic and Mechanical Relations") to review, and <b>submit</b> <b>for</b> publication. In the paper, Heisenberg formulated quantum theory, avoiding the concrete, but unobservable, representations of electron orbits by using parameters such as transition probabilities for quantum jumps, which necessitated using two indexes {{corresponding to the}} initial and final states. When Born read the paper, he recognized the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices, which he had learned from his study under Jakob Rosanes at Breslau University.|$|E

25|$|The Railway Labor Executives' Association (RLEA) {{was formed}} August 16–18, 1926, in Washington, D.C. The {{membership}} of the association was the president (or his or her representative) of each member union, and each union received a single vote in the organization's decision-making processes regardless of its size. The president of the Railway Employes' Department, {{a division of the}} American Federation of Labor (AFL; and later the AFL-CIO) was also a member and had a vote. The organization was voluntary, which meant that no member was bound by its decisions. However, members were required to <b>submit</b> (<b>for</b> informational purposes only) any federal legislative proposal which might significantly impact the other RLEA member unions. The organization's first chairman (also sometimes called its president) was David B. Robertson of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen & Enginemen. Robertson stepped down to devote more time to his union, and Alexander F. Whitney, President of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, was elected his successor.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a method of performing surveillance for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is to screen specimens <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> Clostridium difficile testing. We compared this approach to our focused surveillance program of high-risk units during October 1997 to compare the yield of VRE and multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MDRE) with both methods. Of the stools <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> C. difficile testing, 14 % were positive for VRE or MDRE, whereas rectal swabs from routine surveillance yielded 11 % VRE- or MDRE-positive results. Although stools <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> C. difficile testing resulted in a higher percentage of positive cultures, 14 VRE- and 2 MDRE-positive patients from our high-risk population were missed because many patients had no stool <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> C. difficile testing. Therefore, while screening stools <b>submitted</b> <b>for</b> C. difficile testing cannot replace our focused surveillance program, it appears advantageous to assess these stools at various intervals to detect new patient reservoirs of drug-resistant organisms that may benefit from routine surveillance cultures...|$|R

Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly concurred that Chenoweth's performance was Emmy-worthy, though felt {{she may have}} been slightly overused in the episode. Stack noted that he did not love [...] "Home" [...] upon his first viewing, but praised it for adding depth to the characters and tackling body image and sexuality issues. Rick Bentley of McClatchy Newspapers called the episode [...] "as perfect as television can get", praising Colfer's performance and also deeming him deserving of an Emmy nomination. Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald similarly assessed that [...] "Home" [...] is: [...] "the strongest episode of the season to date, the one Fox should <b>submit</b> <b>for</b> Emmy consideration."

Over the years, he had written several scripts but had never submitted them to The X-Files writing staff.

Guttridge showed Hawryliw a script he had been writing that he wanted to <b>submit</b> <b>for</b> The X-Files. Although the story was not written like an X-Files script, Hawryliw enjoyed the premise. The two decided to form a partnership: Guttridge would craft the basic story and script and Hawryliw would help to craft it into an X-Files script. Hawryliw later explained that the idea to make Pinker search out his son: [...] "There's this unique man who can walk through walls. Now, who would this ability best apply to? Well, a convict obviously—a guy in prison. But then we had to give him an even stronger, more compelling reason to want his freedom, and that was where his son came from".|$|E

2500|$|The fifth {{match of}} the night had Titán defend his Mexican National Welterweight Championship against {{challenger}} Averno following several weeks of Averno humiliating the champion during Best {{two out of three}} falls Six-man tag team matches. Averno had Mephisto in his corner for this important match while Titán had Super Halcón, Jr. as his corner man for the match. The experienced Averno dominated most of the first fall, winning it after using his Devil's Wings (Spinning lifting sitout double underhook facebuster), finishing move to put the champion at a disadvantage. The second fall saw Titán skills to defeat Averno, pushing the match to a third and deciding fall. The third fall saw both wrestlers fight outside the ring, including Titán throwing Averno off the ramp to the floor and moments later Averno throw Titán into the steel barricade surrounding the ring. The impact against the steel was so severe that doctors came to ringside to examine Titán's shoulder. Moments later he was allowed to continue to wrestle, but did not use the arm much {{during the rest of the}} match. In the end Titán was able to overcome a Devil's Wings off the top rope, and then managed to apply the Tirabuzon (Spanish for [...] "Corkscrew", an Abdominal stretch) that forced Averno to <b>submit</b> <b>for</b> the third and final fall. The fans showed their appreciation for the action packed entertaining match by throwing money into the ring, a tradition in Lucha Libre after a great match.|$|E
2500|$|The fourth match saw {{the debut}} of Dragon Lee as the new Místico, taking over the mask and name of CMLL's most {{successful}} wrestler ever, the original Místico (Now known as Sin Cara). While CMLL had tried to copy Místico's image and persona since the original left CMLL to join World Wrestling Entertainment, primarily {{by the introduction of}} Magnus, CMLL had not given anyone the specific name and mask of the original until this point. Místico was accompanied by Fray Tormenta, the [...] "Wrestling Priest", who had also acted as the Padrino (Literally Godfather") of the original Místico, giving his official blessing to the new Místico before the match even begun. The new Místico teamed up with Valiente and Ángel de Oro, who had originally been offered the role of the new Místico but declined. The team would face Los Hijos del Averno ("The Sons of Hell"; Ephesto and Mephisto) and Euforia. Los Hijos del Averno had been constant rivals with the original Místico and had worked together in a series of very well received and profitable matches. La Nuevo Era Místico did not have an easy debut as the Rudo trio ganged up on him and actually attacked him so brutally that the team was disqualified to lose the first fall. In the second fall Los Hijos pinned both Valiente and Ángel de Oro, but not Místico as the team took the second fall. The final fall did not involve Místico at all as Ángel de Oro forced Mephisto to <b>submit</b> <b>for</b> the victory. Following the match Los Hijos attacked Místico again, tearing his mask open. Following the match Místico rated his own effort as a [...] "7 out of 10" [...] and noted that while it was not a perfect debut he still considered it successful.
