2500|$|In December 1997, {{acting on}} the desire to [...] "offer much more timely information," [...] Winer {{designed}} and implemented an XML <b>syndication</b> <b>format</b> for use on his Scripting News weblog, thus making an early contribution {{to the history of}} web syndication technology. By December 2000, competing dialects of RSS included several varieties of Netscape's RSS, Winer's RSS 0.92, and an RDF-based RSS 1.0. Winer continued to develop the branch of the RSS fork originating from RSS 0.92, releasing in 2002 a version called RSS 2.0. Winer's advocacy of web syndication in general and RSS 2.0 in particular convinced many news organizations to syndicate their news content in that format. For example, in early 2002 the New York Times entered an agreement with UserLand to syndicate many of their articles in RSS 2.0 format. Winer resisted calls by technologists to have the shortcomings of RSS 2.0 improved. Instead, he froze the format and turned its ownership over to Harvard University.|$|E

50|$|One {{product of}} that {{contentious}} debate {{was the creation}} of an alternative <b>syndication</b> <b>format,</b> Atom, that began in June 2003. The Atom <b>syndication</b> <b>format,</b> whose creation was in part motivated by a desire to get a clean start free of the issues surrounding RSS, has been adopted as IETF Proposed Standard RFC 4287.|$|E
50|$|Video logs (vlogs) {{also often}} take {{advantage}} of web syndication {{to allow for the}} distribution of video over the Internet using either the RSS or Atom <b>syndication</b> <b>formats,</b> for automatic aggregation and playback on mobile devices and personal computers (See video podcast).|$|R
50|$|GData (Google Data Protocol) {{provides}} a simple protocol for {{reading and writing}} data on the Internet, designed by Google. GData combines common XML-based <b>syndication</b> <b>formats</b> (Atom and RSS) with a feed-publishing system based on the Atom Publishing Protocol, plus some extensions for handling queries. It relies on XML or JSON as a data format.|$|R
50|$|The {{prevalence}} of web syndication is also of note to online marketers, since web surfers {{are becoming increasingly}} wary of providing personal information for marketing materials (such as signing up for a newsletter) and expect the ability to subscribe to a feed instead. Although the format could be anything transported over HTTP, such as HTML or JavaScript, it is more commonly XML. Web <b>syndication</b> <b>formats</b> include RSS and Atom.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the XML based RSS <b>syndication</b> <b>formats</b> used in weblogs can be utilized as the distribution medium for geo-spatial hypermedia, and how this approach {{can be used to}} create a highly distributed multi-user annotation system for geo-spatial hypermedia. It is demonstrated, how the HyCon annotation model [2] can be formulated as a RSS 2. 0 feed and how such feeds allow annotation threads to be distributed across multiple weblogs and servers...|$|R

50|$|Video Power is an American {{television}} series that aired {{in two different}} formats from 1990 - 1992 in <b>syndication.</b> Both <b>formats</b> revolved around video games, and actor Stivi Paskoski presided over both series playing video game master Johnny Arcade.|$|R
5000|$|RDF Site Summary, {{the first}} web <b>syndication</b> <b>format</b> {{to be called}} [...] "RSS", was offered by Netscape in March 1999 for use on the My Netscape portal. This version became known as RSS 0.9.|$|E
50|$|Until October 2007, Bray was co-chairing, with Paul Hoffman, the Atom-focused Atompub Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force. Atom is a web <b>syndication</b> <b>format</b> {{developed}} to address perceived deficiencies with the RSS 2.0 format.|$|E
50|$|The choice by the XCRI {{developers}} to {{be inspired by}} RDF design principles but not to use an RDF binding approach has also been slightly controversial; this approach was also taken by the developers of the Atom <b>Syndication</b> <b>Format.</b>|$|E
50|$|The MyNetworkTV telenovelas were Fox Television's {{attempt to}} create a {{successful}} low-cost programming franchise by adapting Spanish-language telenovelas for U.S. viewers. While originally planned for <b>syndication,</b> the <b>format</b> became the original lineup of MyNetworkTV in 2006. Six limited-run serials were produced, each running about 65 episodes, and at least three others were halted in development.|$|R
50|$|Semillitas {{launched}} its news feed Notipeques that collects and distributes news gathered from international wires with relevant content related to education, health, nutrition and children, {{as well as}} general topics. The news can be accessed through the channel's official website (www.semillitas.tv), the feed is also available as RSS (Really Simple <b>Syndication),</b> a <b>format</b> to distribute frequently updated content and make it easily accessible to blogs and other news services. Notipeques can also be accessed through Semillitasâ€™s Facebook and Twitter pages.|$|R
50|$|Effective December 31, 2007, radio <b>format</b> <b>syndication</b> firm Dial Global offers KPIG's {{programming}} to other stations across the United States via satellite distribution. KPIG's programming is offered to stations {{as either a}} primary format, or via a station's HD Radio subchannel. The format makes KPIG {{one of only three}} terrestrial based radio superstations in the United States (WBBR, a business-talk radio network and 660, The Fan, a Sports station, both in New York City, being the others).|$|R
50|$|Proponents {{of the new}} format {{formed the}} IETF Atom Publishing Format and Protocol Workgroup. The Atom <b>syndication</b> <b>format</b> was {{published}} as an IETF proposed standard in RFC 4287 (December 2005), and the Atom Publishing Protocol was published as RFC 5023 (October 2007).|$|E
50|$|The name Atom {{applies to}} a pair of related Web standards. The Atom <b>Syndication</b> <b>Format</b> is an XML {{language}} used for web feeds, while the Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub or APP) is a simple HTTP-based protocol for creating and updating web resources.|$|E
5000|$|Apache Abdera is an {{implementation}} of the Atom <b>Syndication</b> <b>Format</b> and Atom Publishing Protocol, which are standards for creating, editing, and publishing web feeds and other web resources. The current focus is on a Java implementation, although C/C++ and [...]NET implementations are being considered.|$|E
40|$|The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) {{began as}} an {{alternative}} to distributed searching of scholarly eprint repositories. The model embraced by the OAI-PMH is that of metadata harvesting, where value-added services (by a "service provider") are constructed on cached copies of the metadata extracted from the repositories of the harvester's choosing. While this model dispenses with the well known problems of distributed searching, it introduces the problem of synchronization. Stated simply, this problem arises when the service provider's copy of the metadata does not match the metadata currently at the constituent repositories. We define some metrics for describing the synchronization problem in the OAI-PMH. Based on these metrics, we study the synchronization problem of the OAI-PMH framework and propose several approaches for harvesters to implement better synchronization. In particular, if a repository knows its update frequency, it can publish it in an OAI-PMH Identify response using an optional About container that borrows from RDF Site <b>Syndication</b> (RSS) <b>Format...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Version 4 {{released}} in September 1997, was shipped with Windows 95 OSR (OEM Service Release) 2.5, {{and the latest}} beta version of Windows 98 and was modified to integrate more closely with Microsoft Windows. It included an option to enable [...] "Active Desktop" [...] which displayed World Wide Web content on the desktop itself and was updated automatically as the content changed. The user could select other pages for use as Active Desktops as well. [...] "Active Channel" [...] technology was also introduced to automatically obtain information updates from websites. The technology {{was based on an}} XML standard known as Channel Definition Format (CDF), which predated the currently used web <b>syndication</b> <b>formats</b> like RSS. This version was designed to work on Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT, and could be downloaded from the Internet, free of charge. It supported Dynamic HTML (DHTML). Outlook Express 4.0 also came integrated into the browser and replaced the aging Microsoft Internet Mail & News product that was released with previous versions. Version 5 came out in March 1999, following Microsoft's release of Internet Explorer 5.0 Beta versions in late 1998 [...] Bi-directional text, ruby text and direct XML/XSLT support were included in this release, along with enhanced support for CSS Level 1 and 2. The actual release of Internet Explorer 5 happened in three stages. Firstly, a Developer Preview was {{released in}} June 1998 (5.0B1), and then a Public Preview was released in November 1998 (5.0B2). Then in March 1999 the final release was released (5.0). In September it was released with Windows 98. Version 5.0 was the last one to be released for Windows 3.1x or Windows NT 3.x. Internet Explorer 5.5 was later released for Windows Me in July 2000, and included many bug fixes and security patches. Version 5.5 was the last to have Compatibility Mode, which allowed Internet Explorer 4 to be run {{side by side with the}} 5.x. With IE6, there was a quirks mode that could be triggered to make it behave like IE5.5 Version 6 was released with Windows XP on August 27, 2001. It mainly focused on privacy and security features, as they had become customer priorities. Microsoft implemented tools that support P3P, a technology under development by the W3C.|$|R
5000|$|Syndication {{remains a}} method of choice for distributing children's programming, {{although}} this has gradually shifted to only produce programs to satisfy the federally mandated [...] "educational-informational" [...] (E/I) rule imposed in the late 1990s {{as part of an}} amendment to the Children's Television Act of 1990 that requires stations to air three hours of educational children's programs every week, regardless of the station's <b>format.</b> <b>Syndication</b> is generally a less expensive option for a local station than to attempt to produce its own locally originated E/I programming; not all networks provide their own E/I programs, so stations that are affiliated with networks that do not carry children's program blocks acquire E/I programs off the syndication market to fulfill the requirements.|$|R
5000|$|The {{final draft}} of Atom 1.0 was {{published}} in July 2005 and was accepted by the IETF as a [...] "proposed standard" [...] in August 2005. Work then continued on the further development of the publishing protocol and various extensions to the <b>syndication</b> <b>format.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS) Catalog {{format is}} a <b>syndication</b> <b>format</b> for {{electronic}} publications based on Atom and HTTP. OPDS Catalogs enable the aggregation, distribution, discovery, and acquisition of electronic publications. OPDS Catalogs use existing or emergent open standards and conventions, with a priority on simplicity.|$|E
50|$|The Atom <b>Syndication</b> <b>Format</b> {{was issued}} as a Proposed Standard in IETF RFC 4287 in December 2005. The co-editors were Mark Nottingham and Robert Sayre. This {{document}} {{is known as}} atompub-format in IETF's terminology. The Atom Publishing Protocol was issued as a Proposed Standard in IETF RFC 5023 in October 2007. Two other drafts have not been standardized.|$|E
5000|$|GeoRSS is a {{specification}} for encoding location {{as part of}} a Web feed. (Web feeds {{are used}} to describe feeds ("channels") of content, such as news articles, Audio blogs, video blogs and text blog entries. These web feeds are rendered by programs such as aggregators and web browsers.) The name [...] "GeoRSS" [...] is derived from RSS, the most known Web feed and <b>syndication</b> <b>format.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The feed URI {{scheme was}} a {{suggested}} {{uniform resource identifier}} (URI) scheme designed to facilitate subscription to web feeds; specifically, it was intended that a news aggregator be launched whenever a hyperlink to a [...] URI was clicked in a web browser.The scheme was intended to flag a document in a <b>syndication</b> <b>format</b> such as Atom or RSS. The document would be typically served over HTTP.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, discussions began {{about moving}} the Atom project to a {{standards}} body {{such as the}} W3C or the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The group eventually chose the IETF and the Atompub working group was formally set up in June 2004, finally giving the project a charter and process. The Atompub working group is co-chaired by Tim Bray (the co-editor of the XML specification) and Paul Hoffman. Initial development {{was focused on the}} <b>syndication</b> <b>format.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In June 2003, Sam Ruby {{set up a}} wiki {{to discuss}} what makes [...] "a well-formed log entry". [...] This initial posting acted as a {{rallying}} point. People quickly started using the wiki to discuss a new <b>syndication</b> <b>format</b> to address the shortcomings of RSS. It also {{became clear that the}} new format could form the basis of a more robust replacement for blog editing protocols such as the Blogger API and LiveJournal XML-RPC Client/Server Protocol as well.|$|E
50|$|The early <b>syndication</b> <b>format</b> {{suppliers}} included Bonneville, Schulke, Triangle, IGM, TM, Drake-Chenault and others. Drake-Chenault (D-C) {{entered the}} business only to record music on tape for the RKO FM stations. D-C was {{a consultant for}} the RKO chain on the AM side and the aforementioned FCC rule was impacting the RKO FM stations. Music tapes were recorded at Gene Chenault's KYNO in Fresno, located on Barton Avenue. Under the name of Barton Industries in the late 60's, format syndication was born. The first format was Hitparade which aired on KHJ-FM in Los Angeles.|$|E
5000|$|The {{syndicated}} version {{became an}} anthology series, entitled The Groovie Goolies and Friends, featuring over 104 half-hour episodes. The Groovie Goolies were packaged {{with several other}} Filmation series in shared rotation. The <b>syndication</b> <b>format</b> featured new opening credits and [...] "bumpers", with the original end credits for each series retained. The series included The New Adventures of Waldo Kitty (minus the live-action sequences) (13 Shows), Lassie's Rescue Rangers (17 Shows), The New Adventures of Gilligan (24 Shows), My Favorite Martians (16 Shows), and former Uncle Croc's Block segments M.U.S.H. ("Mangy Unwanted Shabby Heroes"), Fraidy Cat, and Wacky and Packy (Combined into 18 Shows).|$|E
50|$|Both WOTV and WZZM {{have had}} a unique history of having one ABC {{affiliate}} pre-empt network programming during Labor Day weekend for the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon while another aired the pre-empted ABC programming. In recent years, WOTV has aired the MDA Telethon while WZZM has aired ABC programming preempted by the telethon. It was {{the other way around}} in previous years however. Bill Steffen was also the only current news personality to appear on the telethon on both stations having been employed by WZZM and WOOD-TV. Starting in 2013, however, both WZZM and WOTV aired the MDA Show of Strength {{at the same time as}} the program switched from a <b>syndication</b> <b>format</b> to a network telecast on ABC. On May 18, 2007, LIN TV announced that it was exploring strategic alternatives that could have resulted in the sale of the company.|$|E
5000|$|In December 1997, {{acting on}} the desire to [...] "offer much more timely information," [...] Winer {{designed}} and implemented an XML <b>syndication</b> <b>format</b> for use on his Scripting News weblog, thus making an early contribution {{to the history of}} web syndication technology.

5000|$|It {{should be}} noted that album {{publication}} of [...] "Fort Navajo", due the fact that Charlier had chosen to disseminate the title outside the French, Spanish and Portuguese language areas in magazine syndication, has posed problems for publishers in other language countries, especially in Germany and north-west Europe, when Blueberry broke out in popularity in the late 1960s - early 1970s, well before the syndication term was to expire in 1974. It is not known why Charlier had chosen this format for [...] "Fort Navajo", as the US derived <b>syndication</b> <b>format</b> was by that time already well on its way out for European comics, after the relative immediate post-war paper shortage was no longer an issue. Since [...] "Fort Navajo" [...] was the first part of a five book story arc, this caused continuity, or rather chronology problems as publishers were not yet able to publish the book in their countries. The respective publishers all went about the conundrum in their own way; in Germany the book was first re-serialized as a magazine publication, before continuing with the book releases of the subsequent titles; in the Netherlands and Flanders it was decided to push ahead with book publication regardless of [...] "Fort Navajo", and in the Scandinavian countries it was decided to forego on the publication of the first five titles altogether, instead opting to start book publication with book six, [...] "L'homme Ã  l'Ã©toile d'argent", leaving publication of the first five titles for a future point in time. No matter what solution was chosen, it became {{one of the reasons for}} the messed up book release chronologies for those countries (only aggravated by both the later addition of Young, and Marshal Blueberry book titles as well as the aforementioned publishing wanderings), confusing readership, especially in Germany. It was Finnish publisher Sanoma that became the first publisher able to release the first other language book edition of the title in 1974, directly after the syndication term had expired, as [...] "Navaho: VÃ¤ijytys Punaisessa laaksossa" [...] ( [...] , notice the Finnish adherence to the originally intended series name, by now dropped by the parent publisher), that country's very first Blueberry book publication, thereby avoiding the conundrum. Nor had the conundrum been an issue for the UK, as book publication only started in 1977.|$|E
