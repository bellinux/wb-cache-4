The Flavour Industry has provided genotoxicity studies for the representative substance 2, 6 -dimethyl- 2, 5, 7 -octatriene- 1 -ol acetate [FL-no: 09. 931] and these data are considered by EFSA to be representative for the four substances [FL-no: 02. 216, 02. 217, 09. 034 and 09. 712]. Based on the new data, the Panel concluded that 2, 6 -dimethyl- 2, 5, 7 -octatriene- 1 -ol acetate [FL-no: 09. 931] from FGE. 19 subgroup 1. 1. 2 does not give rise to concern with respect to genotoxicity and can accordingly be evaluated using the Procedure. This conclusion can also be applied to the four substances 12 -beta-santalen- 14 -ol [FL-no: 02. 216], 12 -alpha-santalen- 14 -ol [FL-no: 02. 217], <b>santalyl</b> <b>acetate</b> [FL-no: 09. 034] and santalyl phenylacetate [FL-no: 09. 712] from FGE. 19 subgroup 2. 1 for which 2, 6 -dimethyl- 2, 5, 7 -octatriene- 1 -ol acetate [FL-no: 09. 931] is representative...|$|E
