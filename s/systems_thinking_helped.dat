The paper suggests that this is odd, given the attention (both theoretical and practical) commanded by the subject over the past 30 years. Drawing on the author???s experience in executive search and analysing critically the lessons proposed by the UK???s inquiry into bank governance, this paper argues that common ways of leading and of thinking about leadership, in conjunction with <b>systems</b> <b>thinking,</b> <b>helped</b> cause this crisis and are already contributing to the next.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to answer the research question whether distributed leadership {{is located at the}} intersection of formal and informal leadership at the Zen Law School (ZLS). ZLS is a post graduate vocational law school located in the higher education sector (HE). The staff membership comprise multiple professionals, including the academic staff who are members of the legal profession. A single case study method is employed to analyse the activities of a homogenous staff group at ZLS engaged in a strategic planning process by looking at the interactions of both formal and informal leaders. The results indicate that distributed leadership can be said to be located at the intersection of formal and informal leadership. It was considered to represent leadership as a complex concept. Understanding its complexity and linking it to <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>helped</b> to identify nuances. It is perhaps best described as ‘hybrid’ leadership, as ‘distributed’ does not adequately articulate the fluidity of the leadership forms. It is recommended that policy makers and particularly in the HE sector create opportunities to engage broad based leadership. Activities focused around whole organization improvements such as strategic planning provide a basis for many persons to contribute to leadership...|$|E

40|$|Design {{ingenuity}} and sustainability can, and should, work together. Designers have an ethical responsibility to provide ideas that do no harm, and better yet, create positive solutions that nourish the environment, {{social and cultural}} structures, and the economy. This approach, referred to as sustainable <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> [...] in contrast to more common design approaches [...] looks at a problem as an integrated component of an entire network. Sustainable <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>helps</b> designers, clients, and consumers to consider who or what {{is connected to the}} design outcome, where the project will have positive and negative ecological, financial, cultural or social impacts, and make the entire supply chain visible. This process requires a more holistic and deeply collaborative method that still emphasizes creativity and innovation like traditional design processes. This also calls for a redefined craft that explores new materials and processes to confront issues of sustainability and to better understand the interconnectedness of all parts of a system. ^ While some individual designers are taking the lead, unfortunately, sustainable <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> is rarely taught in communication design education. To become a guiding principle rather than an exception, the process of <b>thinking</b> in sustainable <b>systems</b> must be integrated into the fundamental curriculum in communication design education. This argument is the basis of my research agenda. The results of a survey I conducted indicate that sustainable <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> education is rarely taught in undergraduate design courses. This survey also shows the desire from students to learn about this topic in communication design programs. Through personal interviews, design educators shared their perspective on integrating sustainable <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> in curricula. Incorporating <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> into the core undergraduate education will allow students to begin thinking, at a visceral level, about problems as components of larger systems and connected concerns. As a result, it is my goal that the designers of tomorrow will have the power and knowledge to design responsibly for more social equality, cultural preservation, environmental viability and economic stability. ...|$|R

To establish whether improved <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> may be a result of participating in business simulation programs, participants needed to be separated from their day-to-day reality and confronted with managing their organisations in a virtual world. The virtual world in which participants needed to immerse themselves was a customised business simulation designed to capture some of the critical elements of their organisation in a simplified virtual micro-world. This new world allowed participants to engage with and experiment with their organisations in a risk free environment and from a holistic systems perspective. Experimental research was conducted to determine whether it may be possible that individuals participating in these business simulation programs experience a shift in mental models towards <b>systems</b> <b>thinking.</b> The feedback received from participants showed high levels of agreement with respect to the fact that the simulation tools allowed them to engage with the virtual model from a systems perspective. Approximately a third of all participants reported that their most significant insight during the simulation program was in some way related to their new way of seeing and understanding the system of which they are part. The study concludes with the notion that organisations should further encourage <b>systems</b> <b>thinking,</b> which will <b>help</b> them deal with the complexity of the environment in which we operate on a day-to-day basis.

40|$|Land {{managers}} are regularly {{faced with the}} prospect of having to anticipate the consequences of their actions, and avoid unintended consequences, without comprehensive information about the system surrounding their management activities, for a number of reasons. First, natural systems are complex and while information may be available to assist managers in decision-making, it is often uncertain. Second, relevant information is often fragmented and scattered throughout scientific publications, reports, databases and in the heads of experienced people, making it difficult for managers to utilise. Third, people can have divergent views about management because pieces of information often relate to different management objectives (e. g. conservation vs. production) and different people hold different opinions about how management systems operate. This uncertain, fragmented and conflicting picture of natural resource management can result in managers continually dealing with symptoms rather than the underlying causes of management problems. Thus, there is a need to integrate information surrounding land management issues in a systematic way. This paper provides an insight into how <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> can be used as a mechanism for developing an understanding of the issues under consideration.

However, the high failure rate of many ICT for development (ICT 4 D) interventions and their limited focus on wellbeing impact has drawn attention to the needs for designing better evaluation frameworks to help make sense of the complex realities in which ICT interventions take place, and for interrogating the usefulness of mainstream approaches on the impact of ICT 4 D interventions on wellbeing. Efforts to operationalise the capability approach, and to apply it to the field of ICT 4 D constitute an increasingly popular alternative in this regard. The alternative shifts the focus of ICT 4 D evaluation away from an exclusive focus on technology access and use, towards understanding their multidimensional development outcomes, including their impact on wellbeing. One avenue, which has largely been underexplored, is the potential contribution of <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> approaches for further strengthening the focus on multidimensional development outcomes while improving the practical applicability of ICT 4 D evaluations. This doctoral research sets out to explore how <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> concepts and techniques can be used to complement existing approaches so as to increase the success rate of ICT 4 D interventions, as measured by their effect on the wellbeing of intended beneficiaries. Drawing on multiple theoretical influences, including the capability approach, systemic inquiry, critical theory and pragmatism, this thesis evaluates four ICT 4 D interventions, including a researcher-led ICT 4 D intervention, which have all taken place in Indigenous communities of the North Rupununi, Guyana, between 2005 and 2015. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the wellbeing impact of ICT 4 D interventions is primarily determined by whether they are introduced to address locally-defined needs and the extent to which beneficiary communities are involved in their design, implementation and evaluation. It argues that applying concepts and techniques from <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> can <b>help</b> address some of the criticism and shortcomings of established and emerging approaches for evaluating ICT 4 D interventions, by looking beyond efficiency and optimisation towards questions of participation, power, purpose and values. The research then outlines the contours of a Systemic Implementation and Evaluation (SIE) framework, as a way to draw attention to the inevitable clashes of worldviews that characterise interventions involving multiple stakeholders, and to allow a critical reflection on the nature of these interventions and the changes brought about. It concludes by producing a series of policy recommendations associated with enhancing the impact of ICT 4 D interventions on Indigenous wellbeing...|$|R
40|$|AbstractToday's work {{environment}} presents engineers with complex challenges that demand holistic approaches. <b>Systems</b> <b>thinking</b> provides ways {{to think about}} a problem and its solutions using “whole system” perspectives. There have been multiple studies that identify the key elements that comprise <b>systems</b> <b>thinking.</b> These studies have resulted in the identification of sets of individual <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> traits, elements, and characteristics. In this paper, the authors further explore and analyze individual <b>systems</b> <b>thinking</b> elements as well as the relationships between the various elements.
