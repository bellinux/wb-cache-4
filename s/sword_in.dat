5|$|Other portraits {{include one}} by William Nicholson dating from 1814 in which Bewick sits {{with a pencil}} {{in his hand and}} a dog beside his chair; the one at his birthplace; and the {{full-length}} seated portrait of 1827 by Thomas Sword Good (see above). Another painting by <b>Sword</b> <b>in</b> the National Portrait Gallery is now no longer thought to be of Bewick. An unsigned painting supposedly of him in the Yale Center for British Art is equally dubious.|$|E

Before {{crossing}} the river Lajta (now Leitha in Austria), which marked the western border of Hungary, the sixteen-year-old Géza was girded with a <b>sword</b> <b>in</b> token of his coming of age.

5|$|The {{symbolic}} use of Szczerbiec {{became a}} bone of contention again in 2009. After {{a monument to}} the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (Ukrayins'ka Povstans'ka Armiya) on the Chryszczata Mountain in southeastern Poland was vandalized, authorities of the Ukrainian city of Lviv demanded the removal of an image of Szczerbiec from the local Polish military cemetery. The Ukrainians, recalling the legendary use of the original <b>sword</b> <b>in</b> a Polish invasion of Kiev, argued it was a Polish nationalist, militaristic and anti-Ukrainian symbol.|$|E
5|$|According to Najmabadi, {{occasionally}} we {{come across}} the lion and sun with a <b>sword</b> <b>in</b> the lion's paw and with a crown during this period. The Mohammad Shah's decree in 1836 states that the lion must erectly stand, bear a saber ("to make it explicitly stands for the military prowess of the state"). The crown was also added {{as a symbol of}} royalty rather than for any particular Qajar monarch. The decree states that the emblem is at once the national, royal, and the state emblem of Iran. In this period the lion was depicted as more masculine and the sun was female. Before this time the sun could be male or female and the lion was represented as a swordless, friendly and subdued seated animal.|$|E

5|$|In 1831, Rundell and Bridge {{sold the}} diamond to the Emanuel Brothers for about 7,200 pounds (today about £). Six {{years later in}} 1837, the Emanuel Brothers sold the Nassak Diamond at a public sale to Robert Grosvenor, the 1st Marquess of Westminster. At one point, the Marquess mounted the diamond in the handle of his dress <b>sword.</b> <b>In</b> 1886, the diamond was valued at between 30,000 and 40,000 pounds (today between £ and £), {{due in part to}} its vast gain in brilliancy from the re-cut by Rundell and Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Many of Parsons' {{writings}} were posthumously {{published as}} Freedom is a Two-Edged <b>Sword</b> <b>in</b> 1989, a compilation co-edited by Cameron and O.T.O. leader Hymenaeus Beta (ceremonial name of musician William Breeze), which incited {{a resurgence of}} interest in Parsons within occult and countercultural circles. For example, comic book artist and occultist Alan Moore noted Parsons as a creative influence in a 1998 interview with Clifford Meth. The Cameron-Parsons Foundation was founded as an incorporated company in 2006, {{with the intention of}} conserving and promoting Parsons' writings and Cameron's artwork, and in 2014 Fulger Esoterica published Songs for the Witch Woman—a limited edition book of poems by Parsons with illustrations by Cameron, released to coincide with his centenary.

5|$|Ragnall's {{grant to}} the priory of Paisley is {{preserved}} in two documents: one {{dates to the}} late twelfth- or early thirteenth century, and a later copy is contained in an instrument which dates to 1426.

5|$|The {{pavilion}} {{is built}} on a cruciform layout with {{the northern and southern}} ends being longer. The roof is topped with a spire of five-tiers, making it a prasat rather than a 'maha prasat' (which has seven). The spire is supported by swans as opposed to the traditional garudas. The eastern pediment depicts the Hindu god Shiva standing on a plinth with one foot raised, holding a <b>sword</b> <b>in</b> his left hand and right hand raised to a blessing.

Joan is also seen finding her <b>sword</b> <b>in</b> a field as a child, whereas historically it was uncovered many years later on her journey to Chinon.|$|E

5|$|Alliance {{with his}} father-in-law, Władysław I the Elbow-high, King of Poland, became a {{permanent}} element of Charles's {{foreign policy in}} the 1320s. After being defeated by the united forces of the Teutonic Knights and John of Bohemia, WładysławI sent his son and heir, Casimir, to Visegrád in late 1329 to seek assistance from Charles. During his stay in Charles's court, the nineteen-year-old Casimir seduced Claire Záh, who was a lady-in-waiting of Charles's wife, Elisabeth of Poland, according to an Italian writer. On 17April 1330, the young lady's father, Felician Záh, stormed into the dining room of the royal palace at Visegrád with a <b>sword</b> <b>in</b> his hand and attacked the royal family. Záh wounded both Charles and the queen on their right hand and attempted to kill their two sons, Louis and Andrew, before the royal guards killed him. Charles's revenge was brutal: with the exception of Claire, Felician Záh's children were tortured to death; Claire's lips and all eight fingers were cut before she was dragged by a horse through the streets of many towns; all of Felician's other relatives within the third degree of kinship (including his sons-in-law and sisters) were executed, and those within the seventh degree were condemned to perpetual serfdom.|$|E
5|$|As {{introduced}} in Soulcalibur, Ivy {{was raised by}} the Valentines, a noble family in London, England. Ivy's father became obsessed with the cursed sword Soul Edge, and worked himself to death. Her mother died shortly afterward, and revealed to Ivy {{that she was not}} their biological daughter. Becoming an alchemist, Ivy learned of her father's obsession and decided to destroy Soul Edge. She created an animated, segmented sword, bringing it to life by unknowingly summoning Soul Edge's current host, Nightmare, and was convinced to become one of his servants without realizing he wielded the blade she sought. After learning the truth, and that her real father was the sword's previous host Cervantes and her to be its next, she departed. Continuing her quest to destroy the <b>sword</b> <b>in</b> later games, Ivy was attacked by Cervantes and her soul consumed in Soulcalibur IV.
