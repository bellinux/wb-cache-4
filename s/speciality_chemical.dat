50|$|The {{emergence}} of India as a manufacturer and supplier of speciality chemicals {{has had a}} major impact on the Global <b>speciality</b> <b>chemical</b> industry. In India the many <b>speciality</b> <b>chemical</b> companies are members of national organisations such as the Indian Chemical Council (ICC) and the Indian <b>speciality</b> <b>chemical</b> manufacturers association (ISMCA). The wide capability of these companies extends into all sectors and sub-sectors of the <b>speciality</b> <b>chemical</b> market.|$|E
50|$|The <b>speciality</b> <b>chemical</b> {{market is}} complex and each {{specialty}} chemicals business segment comprises many sub-segments, each with individualized product, market and competitive profiles.

Many of these companies are SME's with their own niche products and sometimes technology focus. The common stock of over 400 <b>speciality</b> <b>chemical</b> companies from around the world are identified by Bloomberg the providers of global business and financial information.

5000|$|Speciality {{chemicals}} are materials {{used on the}} basis of their performance or function. Consequently, in addition to [...] "effect" [...] chemicals they are sometimes referred to as [...] "performance" [...] chemicals or [...] "formulation" [...] chemicals. They can be unique molecules or mixtures of molecules known as formulations. The physical and chemical characteristics of the single molecules or the formulated mixtures of molecules and the composition of the mixtures influences the performance end product. In commercial applications the companies providing these products more often than not provide targeted customer service to innovative individual technical solutions for their customers. This is a differentiating component of the service provided by <b>speciality</b> <b>chemical</b> producers when they are compared to the other sub-sectors of the chemical industry such as fine chemicals, commodity chemicals, petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} {{companies in the}} membership of NEPIC can be categorised into three groups: petrochemical, commodity chemical, fine and <b>speciality</b> <b>chemical</b> companies. The petrochemical and commodity {{chemical companies}} are those most likely to utilise large infrastructure such as pipelines, storage facilities, utilities, power stations, port facilities and railways. These companies in this Cluster are almost exclusively based on Teesside, mostly on three chemical industrial parks at Wilton, Billingham and Seal Sands. Examples of large scale commodity manufacturers in the NEPIC Cluster are Sabic making ethylene, low-density polyethylene and aromatics, Ineos acrylonitrile, GrowHow ammonia and ammonia based fertilzers, Ensus bioethanol and animal feed, Conoco Phillips oil refining, Omya Calcium Carbonate, Huntsman polyurathane intermediates and titanium dioxide, Harvest Energy biodiesel and Greenergy fuel blending. These commodity chemical companies used to share logistical, utility and other infrastructure with Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI) who made steel in Redcar until final closure in October 2015. This was Europe's second largest operational blast furnace. TATA Steel still operate steel milling and rolling units on Teesside.|$|E
