She said: [...] "The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie, Flora Plum. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to say, in a nice dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot... Clarice meant so much to Jonathan and I, she really did, and I know it sounds kind of strange to say {{but there was no way}} that either of us could really trample on her." ...|$|E

In 1967 alone, the year I {{supposedly}} made that comment, we recorded Wild Honey, an R album that was entirely different from anything we'd ever done, and I cowrote ten songs and sang three leads." [...] In 1975, he voiced appreciation of the musical form and content of [...] "Surf's Up" [...] from Smile, which he believed went beyond what is normally expected of commercial pop music, {{and in the same}} 1992 article where he refers to some of the Pet Sounds lyrics as [...] "nauseating", he calls Parks a [...] "very gifted musician", saying: [...] "He's great. He's one of the nicest persons in the world. And I tell him, 'Hey, I thought your lyrics, Van Dyke, were brilliant, except who the fuck knows what you're talking about!' That's exactly how I talk to him (laughs). And he and I joke about it." [...] He considers that [...] "a lot of people don't understand I {{have a sense of humor}} that's kind of wack, or different, or sometimes bratty, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> labeled with that and there goes my image, right down the toilet." ...|$|E

[...] Norris, who has played several cops before in film and television, stated: Having played so many cops, I've talked with a lot of technical advisers, so I've been able to pick up a lot. Coincidentally, {{one of my best friends}} growing up is a cop in Chicago, and one of my other best friends out in LA is a sheriff. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to see all the components of that culture.|$|E

I played with Benny Goodman for two years, and I've been {{composing}} for 40. At the time, swing music, big-band music and Benny Goodman in particular were so boundlessly popular that people who made room for it in their lives have never forgotten it. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> calls from people who are in a kind of time warp, who ask me about this period of my life as though it were the present.

However, when he {{returned}} to his corner, he started complaining that there was something burning in his eyes and he could not see. [...] "I didn't know what the heck was going on", Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer, recalled on an NBC special 25 years later. [...] "He said, 'cut the gloves off. I want to prove to the world there's dirty work afoot.' And I said, 'whoa, whoa, back up baby. C'mon now, this is for the title, this is the big apple. What are you doing? Sit down!' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> him down, I get the sponge and I pour the water into his eyes trying to cleanse whatever's there, but before I did that I put my pinkie in his eye and I put it into my eye. It burned like hell. There was something caustic in both eyes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the album}} {{listening}} party, Spin described the album as having no ballads except [...] "Body Party" [...] whilst John Kennedy, writing for Vibe, described the album as [...] "feel-good midtempo" [...] songs akin to Ciara's Goodies era (circa 2004). In {{an interview with}} MTV News Ciara said that creating her fifth album was the most personal experience of her career thus far. She elaborated that she had asked close friend and collaborator Missy Elliott to review her early progress on Ciara, [...] "I always share my projects with her early. I'll go to her house and play her the records really early in the process, and it's always so cool, but I just have to pinch myself in moments when I see her a lot. I'll be like, 'OK, this is really my friend,' but it's dope because I really respect her. She's done something in music {{that no one has}} done {{and when you look at}} her old references and just her references period, you wonder what the mind of that person is, and she's my friend, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to get a little bit more out of that mind, and it's really cool." ...|$|E
