40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a comparison of relative {{advantages and disadvantages of}} three alternative topologies for the general class of electric motors in which stator windings excite an air gap magnetic field of one pole-number, which is then modulated by a toothed steel structure so as to enable interaction with a heteropolar field of different pole-number produced by an arrangement of rotor permanent magnets. Such machines are variously described as variable-reluctance permanent-magnet (VRPM) or transverse-flux. The tree alternative topologies considered are: single-sided surface-magnet, single-sided surface magnet with <b>stator</b> <b>bridges,</b> and double-sided flux-concentrated...|$|R
40|$|Flux-switching {{permanent}} magnet (FSPM) machine is {{consist of a}} salient rotor and a salient stator with windings and magnets. Adding <b>stator</b> lamination <b>bridge</b> in segmented <b>stator</b> can simplify stator assembly significantly, which will be beneficial to manufacture and popularize the FSPM machine. Due to the doubly salient structure, the cogging torque in FSPM is larger than other traditional PM motors. In this paper, cogging torque of FSPM with <b>stator</b> lamination <b>bridge</b> is analyzed, and a novel short magnet (SM) structure is proposed to reduce the cogging torque by shortening the magnets. The simulation results indicate that shortening magnets reasonably can reduce the cogging torque {{at the cost of}} little output torque loss...|$|R
40|$|Three new motor {{models of}} Single Phase Shade Pole Motor were {{developed}} {{using the method}} of genetic agoithms for optimisation purposes of motor design. In each of newly developed motor models number of varied parameters was gradually increased which results in gradual increase of electroamgnetic torque as target function for optimisation. Increase of electromagnetic torque {{was followed by the}} increase of efficiency factor. Finite Element Method Analysis was performed in order to be obtained magnetic flux distribution in motor cross section. Since newly developed motor moders were experiencing high values of magnetic induction in <b>stator</b> <b>bridge</b> soft magnetic materials were used in that region which finally resulted with lower values of magnetic induction compared to the basic motor model...|$|R
50|$|Marsyas {{consists}} of three steel rings joined together by a single span of specially-designed red PVC membrane. The two rings are positioned vertically, {{at each end of}} the space, while a third is suspended parallel with the <b>bridge.</b> <b>Wedged</b> into place, the geometry generated by these three rigid steel structures determines the sculpture’s overall form, a shiftform vertical to horizontal and back to vertical again. Using digital form-finding techniques that simulate the forces found in biological forms - i.e. surface tension, uniform and hydrostatic pressure, the design was inspired by multiple parallel and diverging concepts and processes.|$|R
50|$|Downstream {{continues}} as a canyon passage which steadily enlarges, passing an inlet passage {{on the left}} where the main water enters which can be followed up to where it becomes choked with boulders underneath the stream sink. The main passage continues for about 300 m up to 15 m high and 5 m wide, under a boulder <b>bridge</b> <b>wedged</b> across the passage, to finish in a choke in a roof chamber. The water then follows a narrow meandering canyon to the first waterfall pitch of 5 m, and continues to a second pitch of 8 m {{at the base of}} which the water disappears into a choked sump pool. A traverse can be followed {{over the top of the}} pitch round to where a pitch enters from the Gavel Pot doline.|$|R

40|$|Flux-switching {{permanent}} magnet (FSPM) machines are gaining in popularity {{due to their}} robustness, wide speed range, high torque, and high power density. However, their strong cogging torque can lead to vibration and noise due to the double-saliency structure. This paper investigates {{the effects of the}} short {{permanent magnet}} (PM) and <b>stator</b> flux <b>bridge</b> (FB) on the cogging torque reduction of three-phase 12 / 10 -pole FSPM machines. Four different FSPM machines, including an inner-inner topology, an inner-outer topology, an outer-inner topology, and an outer-outer topology, are developed and analyzed with both short PM and stator FB. The configurations are obtained by placing the FB at inner/outer stator lamination and reducing the PM towards inner/outer directions. The cogging torque, average output torque, and PM utilization ratio of different topologies are extensively studied and compared by the finite element method (FEM). Finally, prototype machines are manufactured and tested. The experimental results have validated the numerical models and the effectiveness of the developed machine in reducing the cogging torque. The results also suggest that the outer-inner topology is more effective to reduce the cogging torque, which not only reduces the utilization of the PM materials, but also mitigates the cogging torque at only slight cost of torque performance...|$|R
50|$|Small wind turbines, {{particularly}} self-build designs, {{are widely}} adopting magneto alternators for their generators. These use rotating neodymium rare-earth magnets with a three-phase <b>stator,</b> then a <b>bridge</b> rectifier to produce DC. This is then used either directly for water-pumping, stored in batteries, or {{used to drive}} a mains inverter which can supply the grid system for profit. These designs have been encouraged {{by one of the}} most popular self-build designs, described in Hugh Piggott's series of books and courses. A typical design here is an axial-flux generator recycled from a car brake disk and hub bearing. A MacPherson strut provides the azimuth bearing to bring the turbine into the wind. The brake disk, and its attached rare-earth magnets, rotates to form the armature. A plywood disk carrying multiple axial coils is placed alongside this, with a further iron armature ring behind it.|$|R
40|$|A {{class of}} {{bistable}} "stator-rotor" molecules is proposed, where a stationary <b>bridge</b> (<b>stator)</b> connects the two electrodes and facilitates electron transport between them. The rotor part, {{which has a}} large dipole moment, is attached to an atom of the stator via a single sigma bond. Hydrogen bonds formed between the rotor and stator make the symmetric orientation of the dipole unstable. The rotor has two potential minima with equal energy for rotation about the sigma bond. The dipole orientation, which determines the conduction state of the molecule, can be switched by an external electric field that changes the relative energy of the two potential minima. Both orientation of the rotor correspond to asymmetric current-voltage characteristics that are the reverse of each other, so they are distinguishable electrically. Such bistable stator-rotor molecules could potentially be used as parts of molecular electronic devices. Comment: 8 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|The cotton {{economy of}} Burkina Faso has been {{characterized}} by a changing rural environment for farmers since late nineties, which has come with the cotton reform and the resulting cotton boost. There have been slight improvements in living standards and rural households’ income while the subjective feeling of wealth has significantly increased. In this paper, I explore the channels through which {{the elements of the}} changing rural environment can <b>bridge</b> the <b>wedge</b> between subjective and objective measures of wealth. In addition to the basic determinants of subjective welfare that {{can be found in the}} happiness economics literature, namely absolute and relative income measures, health and social status (and expectations of future incomes), I investigate the empirical validity of institutional and technological change as well as the perceptions about the reform. I propose a bivariate ordered Probit model to deal with endogenous covariant perceptions in the assessment of subjective wealth. I find that the significantly positive evolution of subjective wealth has been driven by the relative measure of income, the feeling of progress through institutional and technological improvements and by enthusiastic perceptions about the reform’s effects on poverty alleviation and welfare. This evolution has been altered by the beliefs about a larger input access and better agricultural abilities resulting from the reform (comparison effect). subjective wealth, Burkina Faso's cotton, rural development, agricultural policy, perceptions, Community/Rural/Urban Development, Crop Production/Industries, I 32, O 13, Q 16, Q 18,...|$|R
