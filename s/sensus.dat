5|$|The Catholic Church at {{the time}} faced {{difficulty}} retaining converts. Some Javanese, who had converted as students, returned to Islam after reentering society and facing social ostracism. In a 1935 meeting with other Jesuits, Soegijapranata blamed the problem {{on the lack of}} a united Catholic identity, or <b>sensus</b> Catholicus, as well as few intermarriages between native Catholics. Soegijapranata opposed marriage between Catholics and non-Catholics. He counselled young Catholic couples before marriage, believing that these unions helped unite the Catholic families in the city, and continued to write for Swaratama, again serving as its editor in chief. In 1938, he was chosen to advise the Society of Jesus, coordinating Jesuit work in the Indies.|$|E
5|$|As {{they travel}} across the war-torn land, they are confronted by avatars {{in the service}} of {{multiple}} nations, and Arca - a cult made up of avatars led by a woman known as Mathias. Chitose joins Arca to further their cause of a utopia for avatars, and tries to persuade Luca to join, causing a rift between them. The conflicts between the groups is further inflamed as more people regain their memories as warriors of <b>Sensus</b> or Ratio, sparking old conflicts. In their adventures, the group works to end the fighting and learn about their past lives. When the full truth is revealed, they decide to fulfill Asura's wishes and unite the two worlds. This brings them into conflict with Mathias, who is revealed to be the incarnation of Asura's wrath at being betrayed, and now wishes to destroy both Devaloka and Naraka. Chitose, consumed by Sakuya's love for Asura, helps Mathias in her task. The party confront Mathias and Chitose in Devaloka's ruined capital, where the Manifest is hidden. They defeat Mathias, and Chitose kills herself in a fit of despair. Luca then proceeds to use the Manifest to merge Devaloka and Naraka, nullifying the avatars' powers and lessening the chance of future conflicts. The group then returns to their normal lives.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Sensus</b> Plenior of Sacred Scripture, Baltimore: St. Mary's University, 1955. This was his {{dissertation}} in partial fulfillment of his doctorate in Sacred Theology.

25|$|The {{spread of}} Marian devotions, {{such as the}} Rosary via lay organizations, has also {{influenced}} popular interest in Mariology, the growth of Marian devotions building <b>sensus</b> fidelium, which influences the public interest in specific aspects of Mariology. Marian devotions generally begin {{at the level of}} popular piety, often in connection with the religious experiences and visions of simple and modest individuals (in some cases children), and the recounting of their experiences in time creates strong emotions among numerous Roman Catholics to build <b>sensus</b> fidelium.|$|E
25|$|Despite the criticism, the {{influence}} of the Scottish school was notable for example upon American pragmatism, and modern Thomism. The influence has been particularly important concerning the epistemological importance of a <b>sensus</b> communis for any possibility of rational discussion between people.|$|E
25|$|Kant used {{different}} {{words to}} refer to his aesthetic <b>sensus</b> communis, for which he used Latin or else German Gemeinsinn, and the more general English meaning which he associated with Reid and his followers, for which he used various terms such as gemeinen Menscheverstand, gesunden Verstand, or gemeinen Verstand.|$|E
25|$|Another {{link between}} Latin communis <b>sensus</b> and Aristotle's Greek was in rhetoric, {{a subject that}} Aristotle {{was the first to}} systematize. In rhetoric, a prudent speaker must take account of {{opinions}} (Greek doxai) that are widely held. Aristotle referred to such commonly held beliefs not as koinai doxai, which is a term he used for self-evident logical axioms, but with other terms such as endoxa.|$|E
25|$|Leonardo was a {{physiologist}} {{as well as}} an anatomist, {{studying the}} function of the human body as well as examining and recording its structure. He dissected and drew the human skull and cross-sections of the brain, transversal, sagittal, and frontal. These drawings may be linked to a search for the <b>sensus</b> communis, the locus of the human senses, which, by Medieval tradition, was located at the exact physical center of the skull.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, two {{separate}} factors had combined forces to support the approval of a dogma for Immaculate Conception. On one hand, the theological arguments had been further refined and gained popularity so that for about a century before its dogmatic definition, almost the entire Church believed the Immaculate Conception. And it was largely in recognition of the existing <b>sensus</b> fidei in its regard, witnessed to by the majority of Roman Catholic bishops, that Pope Pius IX declared it a dogma in Ineffabilis Deus. This greatly helped the spread of devotions and consecrations to the Immaculata.|$|E
25|$|The {{discussion}} was apparently intended to improve upon {{the account of}} Aristotle's friend and teacher Plato in his Socratic dialogue, the Theaetetus. But Plato's dialogue presented an argument that recognizing koina is an active thinking process in the rational {{part of the human}} soul, making the senses instruments of the thinking part of man. Plato's Socrates says this kind of thinking is not a kind of sense at all. Aristotle, trying to give a more general account of the souls of all animals, not just humans, moved the act of perception out of the rational thinking soul into this <b>sensus</b> communis, which is something like a sense, and something like thinking, but not rational.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{himself did}} not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give {{knowledge}} a more solid basis, but as Richard J. Bernstein remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:Once we begin to question {{whether there is a}} common faculty of taste (a <b>sensus</b> communis), we are easily led down the path to relativism. And this is what did happen after Kant - so much so that today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.|$|E
25|$|In its mature version, Vico's {{conception}} of <b>sensus</b> communis {{is defined by}} him as “judgment without reflection, shared by an entire class, an entire people, and entire nation, or the entire human race”. Vico proposed his own anti-Cartesian methodology for a new Baconian science, inspired, he said, by Plato, Tacitus, Francis Bacon and Grotius. In this he went further than his predecessors concerning the ancient certainties available within vulgar common sense. What is required, according to his new science, {{is to find the}} common sense shared by different people and nations. He made this a basis for a new and better-founded approach to discuss Natural Law, improving upon Grotius, John Selden, and Pufendorf who he felt had failed to convince, because they could claim no authority from nature. Unlike Grotius, Vico went beyond looking for one single set of similarities amongst nations but also established rules about how natural law properly changes as peoples change, and has to be judged relative to this state of development. He thus developed a detailed view of an evolving wisdom of peoples. Ancient forgotten wisdoms, he claimed, could be re-discovered by analysis of languages and myths formed under the influence of them. This is comparable to both Montesquieu's Spirit of the Laws, as well as much later Hegelian historicism, both of which apparently developed without any awareness of Vico's work.|$|E
500|$|The {{world of}} Innocence is {{divided between the}} [...] "divine" [...] world of Devaloka (divided between the regions of <b>Sensus</b> and Ratio) and the lower human world of Naraka. As Devaloka needed human souls to survive, the <b>Sensus</b> general Asura {{decided to use the}} Manifest, an {{artifact}} created by the ancient Primordial Giant, to merge Devaloka and Naraka. This plan was opposed by many, leading to war between <b>Sensus</b> and Ratio. Asura was aided by the Devalokans Inanna, Orifiel and Sakuya; his sentient sword Durandal; and his dragon companion Vrtra. Asura eventually won, defeating the Ratio general Hypnos in battle. Before he could use the Manifest, Inanna betrayed and stabbed him with Durandal. He kills her before he dies, leaving the unification of Devaloka and Naraka unfinished. Most of Devaloka's population is killed in the process, with the others eventually dying years later. In the present, Naraka is governed by the imperial capital of Regnum and the western country of Garam, who {{are in a state of}} war. Added to this is the emergence of [...] "avatars", Devalokans reincarnated in human form who hold supernatural powers. They are hunted and inducted into Regnum's military and used for experimentation or as front line troops in the war.|$|E

2500|$|Hannah Arendt adapted Kant's {{concept of}} <b>sensus</b> communis as a faculty of {{aesthetic}} judgement that imagines the judgements of others, into something relevant for political judgement. Thus she created a [...] "Kantian" [...] political philosophy, which, {{as she said}} herself, Kant did not write. She argued that there was often a banality to evil in the real world, for example {{in the case of}} someone like Adolf Eichmann, which consisted in a lack of <b>sensus</b> communis and thoughtfulness generally. Arendt and also Jürgen Habermas, who took a similar position concerning Kant's <b>sensus</b> communis, were criticised by Lyotard for their use of Kant's <b>sensus</b> communis as a standard for real political judgement. Lyotard also saw Kant's <b>sensus</b> communis as an important concept for understanding political judgement, not aiming at any consensus, but rather at a possibility of a [...] "euphony" [...] in [...] "dis-sensus". Lyotard claimed that any attempt to impose any <b>sensus</b> communis in real politics would mean imposture by an empowered faction upon others.|$|E
2500|$|Sentinus or Sentia gives sentience or {{the powers}} of sense {{perception}} (<b>sensus).</b> Augustine calls him the sensificator, [...] "creator of sentience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theologians have {{at times}} cited {{in support of}} their Mariology this {{constant}} <b>sensus</b> fidelium, e.g. Saint Alphonsus Liguori valued texts and traditions of the Church Fathers as expressions of the <b>sensus</b> fidelium {{of the past and}} attributed great weight to the argument that [...] "the greater part of the faithful have always had recourse to the intercession of the divine mother for all the graces which they desire". Speaking of the witness of the Church Fathers in attributing certain titles to Mary, in Fulgens corona Pope Pius XII wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|Pope Pius IX {{defined the}} dogma of the Immaculate Conception [...] "not {{so much because}} of proofs in Scripture or ancient tradition, but due to a {{profound}} <b>sensus</b> fidelium and the Magisterium".|$|E
2500|$|Historically, preterists and [...] non-preterists have {{generally}} agreed that the Jesuit Luis de Alcasar [...] (1554–1613) wrote the first systematic preterist exposition of prophecy - Vestigatio arcani <b>sensus</b> in Apocalypsi (published in 1614) - during the Counter-Reformation.|$|E
2500|$|According to Gadamer, {{at least}} in French and British {{philosophy}} a moral element in appeals to common sense (or bon sens), such as found in Reid, remains normal to this day. But according to Gadamer, the civic quality implied in discussion of <b>sensus</b> communis in other European countries did not take root in the German philosophy of the 18th and 19th centuries, despite the fact it consciously imitated much in English and French philosophy. [...] "Sensus communis was understood as a purely theoretical judgment, parallel to moral consciousness (conscience) and taste." [...] The concept of <b>sensus</b> communis [...] "was emptied and intellectualized by the German enlightenment". But German philosophy was becoming internationally important at this same time.|$|E
2500|$|Hutcheson {{described}} it as, [...] "a Publick Sense, viz. “our Determination to {{be pleased with}} the Happiness of others, and to be uneasy at their Misery.”" [...] which, he explains, [...] "was sometimes called κοινονοημοσύνη or <b>Sensus</b> Communis {{by some of the}} Antients".|$|E
2500|$|Vatican II also {{emphasized}} the <b>sensus</b> fidelium {{as the vehicle}} for the living tradition, with the promise to Peter assuring that the gates of Hades will not prevail against [...] "it", the Church, which is {{the people who are}} the living tradition. Therefore infallibility is [...] "a doctrine and order rooted in and reflecting the <b>sensus</b> fidelium." [...] Rahner insists that a Pope's statements depend essentially on his knowledge of what the living tradition maintains. There is no question of revelation but of preservation from error in the exercise of this oversight. This living tradition was gathered from communication with all the Bishops in the two instances where the Pope defined dogmas apart from a Council, the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption.|$|E
2500|$|Immanuel Kant {{developed}} a new variant {{of the idea of}} <b>sensus</b> communis, noting how having a sensitivity for what opinions are widely shared and comprehensible gives a sort of standard for judgment, and objective discussion, at least in the field of aesthetics and taste:The common Understanding of men , which, as the mere sound (not yet cultivated) Understanding, we regard as the least to be expected from any one claiming the name of man, has therefore the doubtful honour of being given the name of common sense [...] (<b>sensus</b> communis); and {{in such a way that}} by the name common (not merely in our language, where the word actually has a double signification, but in many others) we understand vulgar, that which is everywhere met with, the possession of which indicates absolutely no merit or superiority.|$|E
2500|$|Koinos nous {{is a term}} {{found in}} Epictetus (III.vi.8), a Stoic philosopher. C.S. [...] {{believed}} this {{to be close to}} a modern English meaning of [...] "common sense", [...] "the elementary mental outfit of the normal man", something like intelligence. He noted that <b>sensus</b> could be a translation of nous, (for example in the Vulgate Bible), but he only found one clear case of a Latin text showing this apparent meaning, a text by Phaedrus the fable writer.|$|E
2500|$|The Marian dogmas of the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption of Mary {{were defined}} {{in part on}} the basis of the <b>sensus</b> fidei, [...] "the supernatural {{appreciation}} of faith on the part of the whole people, when, from the bishops to the last of the faithful, they manifest a universal consent in matters of faith and morals". In the case of the dogmas of Immaculate Conception and Assumption, the two popes concerned consulted the Catholic bishops worldwide about the faith of the community before proceeding to define the dogma.|$|E
2500|$|Francis {{decried the}} {{imbalance}} {{that can occur}} “when we speak more about law than about grace, more about the Church than about Christ, more about the Pope than about God’s word” (EG 38). Also, he understands {{the search for truth}} as a dialogical process, mentioning dialogue 60 times in Evangelii Gaudium. He speaks of consensus building (EG 240) and calls for attention to the <b>sensus</b> fidei or [...] "instinct of faith" [...] especially of the poor (EG 198), whereby the faithful discern what is of God through a connaturality or intuitive wisdom (EG 119).|$|E
2500|$|A recent {{commentator}} on Vico, John D. Schaeffer {{has argued}} that Gadamer's approach to <b>sensus</b> communis exposed itself to the criticism of Habermas because it [...] "privatized" [...] it, removing it from a changing and oral community, following the Greek philosophers in rejecting true communal rhetoric, in favour of forcing the concept within a Socratic dialectic aimed at truth. Schaeffer claims that Vico's concept provides a third option to those of Habermas and Gadamer and he compares it to the recent philosophers Richard J. Bernstein, Bernard Williams, Richard Rorty, and Alasdair MacIntyre, and the recent theorist of rhetoric, Richard Lanham.|$|E
2500|$|... "Faith {{both in the}} Immaculate Conception and in {{the bodily}} Assumption of the Virgin was already present in the People of God, while {{theology}} had not yet found the key to interpreting it in {{the totality of the}} doctrine of the faith. The People of God therefore precede theologians and this is all thanks to that supernatural <b>sensus</b> fidei, namely, that capacity infused by the Holy Spirit that qualifies us to embrace the reality of the faith with humility of heart and mind. In this sense, the People of God is the 'teacher that goes first' and must then be more deeply examined and intellectually accepted by theology." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{parallel}} development, Antonio Gramsci, Benedetto Croce, and later Hans-Georg Gadamer took inspiration from Vico's understanding {{of common sense}} {{as a kind of}} wisdom of nations, going beyond Cartesian method. It has been suggested that Gadamer's most well-known work Truth and Method, can be read as an [...] "extended meditation on the implications of Vico's defense of the rhetorical tradition in response to the nascent methodologism that ultimately dominated academic enquiry". In the case of Gadamer, this was in specific contrast to the <b>sensus</b> communis concept in Kant, which he felt (in agreement with Lyotard) could not be relevant to politics if used in its original sense.|$|E
2500|$|Pope John Paul II stated that: [...] "devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus {{and to the}} Immaculate Heart of Mary {{has been}} an {{important}} part of the <b>sensus</b> fidei of the People of God". In his Angelus address on September 15, 1985, Pope John Paul II coined the term The Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, and in 1986 addressed the international conference on that topic held at Fátima, Portugal. He often invoked the Sacred and Immaculate Hearts together and at the beginning of the 21st century encouraged all nations to [...] "consecrate themselves to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary".|$|E
2500|$|In {{twentieth century}} {{philosophy}} {{the concept of}} the <b>sensus</b> communis as discussed by Vico and especially Kant became a major topic of philosophical discussion. The theme of this discussion questions how far the understanding of eloquent rhetorical discussion (in the case of Vico), or communally sensitive aesthetic tastes (in the case of Kant) can give a standard or model for political, ethical and legal discussion in a world where forms of relativism are commonly accepted, and serious dialogue between very different nations is essential. Some philosophers such as Jacques Rancière indeed take the lead from Jean-François Lyotard and refer to the [...] "postmodern" [...] condition as one where there is [...] "dissensus communis".|$|E
2500|$|Koinonoēmosunē {{is found}} only {{in the work of}} the emperor Marcus Aurelius (Meditations I.16), also known as a Stoic. (He uses the word on its own in a list of things he learned from his adopted father.) Shaftesbury and others felt it {{represented}} the Stoic Greek original, which gave the special Roman meaning of <b>sensus</b> communis, especially when used to refer to someone's public spirit. Shaftesbury explained the change of meaning as being due to the specific way that Stoics understood perception and intellect, saying that one should [...] "consider withal how small the distinction was in that Philosophy, between the [...] , and the vulgar [...] how generally Passion was by those Philosophers brought under the Head of Opinion".|$|E
2500|$|As {{with other}} {{meanings}} of common sense, for the Romans {{of the classical}} era [...] "it designates a sensibility shared by all, from which one may deduce a number of fundamental judgments, that need not, or cannot, be questioned by rational reflection". But even though Cicero did at least once use the term in a manuscript on Plato's Timaeus (concerning a primordial [...] "sense, one and common for all [...] connected with nature"), he and other Roman authors did not normally {{use it as a}} technical term limited to discussion about sense perception, as Aristotle apparently had in De Anima, and as the Scholastics later would in the Middle Ages. Instead of referring to all animal judgment, it was used to describe pre-rational, widely shared human beliefs, and therefore it was a near equivalent to the concept of humanitas. This was a term that could be used by Romans to imply not only human nature, but also humane conduct, good breeding, refined manners, and so on. Apart from Cicero, Quintilian, Lucretius, Seneca, Horace and some of the most influential Roman authors influenced by Aristotle's rhetoric and philosophy used the Latin term [...] "sensus communis" [...] in a range of such ways. As C. S. Lewis wrote: Quintilian says it is better to send a boy to school than to have a private tutor for him at home; for if he is kept away from the herd (congressus) how will he ever learn that <b>sensus</b> which we call communis? (I, ii, 20). On the lowest level it means tact. In Horace the man who talks to you when you obviously don't want to talk lacks communis <b>sensus.</b>|$|E
