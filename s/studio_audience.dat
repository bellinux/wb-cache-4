5|$|The {{production}} of the show was in a conventional sitcom format, with episodes taped live {{in front of a}} <b>studio</b> <b>audience,</b> interposed with pre-filmed location material.|$|E
5|$|As with Joking Apart, Ptaszynski {{produced}} Chalk {{for independent}} production company Pola Jones. The positive {{reaction of the}} <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> during recording of the first series in 1996 propelled executives to commission {{a second set of}} six episodes before the first batch had aired.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{exterior}} shots were always filmed {{on location in}} Holmfirth and the surrounding countryside, the interior shots were, until the early 1990s, filmed {{in front of a}} live <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> at BBC Television Centre in London. The amount of location work increased, however, as studio work became a drain on time and money. Under Alan J. W. Bell, Last of the Summer Wine became the first comedy series {{to do away with the}} live <b>studio</b> <b>audience,</b> moving all of the filming to Holmfirth. The episodes were filmed and then shown to preview audiences, whose laughter was recorded and then mixed into each episode's soundtrack to provide a laugh track and avoid the use of canned laughter.|$|E

50|$|The judges {{scores were}} added to the <b>studio</b> <b>audiences</b> votes to decide the winner. No public vote took place, as the {{programme}} was recorded earlier in the year.|$|R
5|$|Although it {{was planned}} that some key {{scenes of the}} episode would be filmed without an {{audience}} {{in order to avoid}} leaks of plot spoilers, the producers decided not to worry about the issue and filmed it all in front of the live <b>studio</b> <b>audience.</b> The producers also instigated the rumor that multiple endings would be filmed; in fact, only one was planned and shot.|$|E
5|$|A pilot {{episode was}} {{commissioned}} on 1 March 1977 and the recording was completed on 28 June 1977. Brett and Adams recounted {{different parts of}} the pilot episode's genesis, including convincing the BBC that such a programme could not be recorded with a <b>studio</b> <b>audience,</b> and insisting that the programme be recorded in stereo sound. To win the latter argument, Hitchhiker's was briefly classified internally as a drama instead of a comedy, as in 1977 BBC Radio Drama programmes were allowed to be recorded in stereo, and BBC Radio Comedy programmes were not.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} good {{reaction}} of the <b>studio</b> <b>audience,</b> a second series was commissioned before the first had been broadcast. However, journalists were critical of the show, highlighting stylistic similarities to Fawlty Towers. Some members of the teaching profession and its unions objected to the negative representation of teachers and the comprehensive system. The second series did not receive a stable broadcast slot, with many episodes aired after 10pm. The first series was released on DVD in December 2008.|$|E

5|$|Television variety {{shows are}} the widest venue for popular music. They change often, but Buona Domenica, Domenica In, and I raccomandati are popular. The longest running musical {{broadcast}} in Italy is La Corrida, a three-hour weekly program of amateurs and would-be musicians. It {{started on the}} radio in 1968 and moved to TV in 1988. The <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> bring cow-bells and sirens and are encouraged to show good-natured disapproval. The city with {{the highest number of}} rock concerts (of national and international artists) is Milan, with a number close to the other European music capitals, as Paris, London and Berlin.|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. To simulate the look of an actual documentary, it is filmed in a single-camera setup, without a <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> or a laugh track. The show debuted on NBC as a mid-season replacement and ran for nine seasons and 201 episodes. The Office initially featured Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer and B. J. Novak as the main cast; the show experienced numerous changes to its ensemble cast during its run.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{location}} shots were filmed {{at the beginning of}} the production block. Recording for the first series of six episodes began on location in the first half of April 1992 and were mainly filmed in Chelsea within a short distance from the director's home. The stand-up sequences were filmed in the Café Des Artistes on London's Fulham Road, now known as the Valmont Club, and were shot for the benefit of the <b>studio</b> <b>audience,</b> with the intention of reshooting them later for the broadcast version. Robert Bathurst has complained that, in order to save £5,000, this promised reshoot never materialised. The close ups of Bathurst were filmed in the studio for the second series, with stock footage of the club's audience reused.|$|E

50|$|Most {{scenes are}} filmed {{in front of}} live <b>studio</b> <b>audiences.</b> Season 1 was filmed in the former St. Francis of Assisi Catholic School {{building}} in Toronto. Later seasons were filmed in Halifax, Nova Scotia in Studio 1 at CBC Halifax.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2014, Aliona Vilani won the Christmas Special partnering Louis Smith. They {{earned a}} perfect score of 40 from the judges for their quickstep to [...] "Jingle Bells" [...] and won after the judges and <b>studio</b> <b>audiences</b> scores were combined.|$|R
5|$|Before Moffat left Pola Jones for Hartswood, Ptaszynski {{produced}} Chalk, {{the series}} {{that the writer}} had pitched {{to him at the}} beginning of the decade. Set in a comprehensive school and starring David Bamber as manic deputy head Eric Slatt and Nicola Walker as Suzy Travis, the show was based on Moffat's three years as an English teacher. The <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> responded so positively to the first series when it was taped that the BBC commissioned a second series before the first had aired. However, it was met less enthusiastically by critics upon transmission in February 1997, who had taken exception to the BBC's publicity department comparing the show to the highly respected Fawlty Towers. In an interview in the early 2000s, Moffat refuses to even name the series, joking that he might get attacked in the street.|$|E
5|$|Gillard met Opposition leader Tony Abbott for one {{official}} debate during the campaign. <b>Studio</b> <b>audience</b> surveys by Channel Nine and the Seven Network suggested a win to Gillard. Unable {{to agree on}} further debates, the leaders went on to appear separately on stage for questioning at community forums in Sydney, New South Wales and Brisbane, Queensland. An audience exit poll of the Rooty Hill RSL audience indicated an Abbott victory. Gillard won the audience poll at the Broncos Leagues Club meeting in Brisbane on 18 August. Gillard also appeared on the ABC's Q program on 9 August. On 7 August, Gillard was questioned by former Labor leader turned Channel Nine reporter Mark Latham.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{the minimum}} age for contestants to {{audition}} {{was changed to}} 14 years old, having previously been 16 years old. Auditions {{in front of the}} show's producers began in March 2011 in five cities: Perth (Parmelia Hilton, 27 March), Adelaide (AAMI Stadium, 29 March), Brisbane (Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre, 2–3 April), Sydney (Australian Technology Park, 8–10 April) and Melbourne (Moonee Valley Racecourse, 15–17 April). The successful auditionees chosen by the producers were then invited back to the last set of auditions that took place in front of the judges and a live <b>studio</b> <b>audience.</b> These auditions were held in three cities: Brisbane (Brisbane Entertainment Centre, 21–22 May), Melbourne (Hisense Arena, 27–29 May), and Sydney (Sydney Entertainment Centre, 2–3 June).|$|E
5000|$|Jude {{appeared}} {{often as}} a guest on The Jenny Jones Show, where he first received the nickname [...] "Rude Jude" [...] as he insulted other particiants in the show. [...] Jones describes Jude as [...] "the <b>studio</b> <b>audience’s</b> favorite guest." ...|$|R
2500|$|In March 2002, Lewinsky, {{no longer}} {{bound by the}} terms of her {{immunity}} agreement, appeared in the HBO special, [...] "Monica in Black and White", part of the America Undercover series. In it she answered a <b>studio</b> <b>audience's</b> questions about her life and the Clinton affair.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1960s, {{nearly every}} U.S. sitcom was shot single-camera and was {{fitted with a}} {{laughter}} track. Only a handful of programs, such as The Joey Bishop Show, The Dick Van Dyke Show and The Lucy Show used <b>studio</b> <b>audiences</b> and turned to Douglass to edit or augment the real laughter via sweetening.|$|R
5|$|The show's writers begin {{each day}} with a morning meeting where they review {{material}} that researchers have gathered from major newspapers, the Associated Press, cable news television channels and websites, and discuss headline material for the lead news segment. Throughout the morning they work on writing deadline pieces inspired by recent news, as well as longer-term projects. By lunchtime, Noah — who describes his role {{as that of the}} captain of a team — has begun to review headline jokes. The script is submitted by 3 pm, and at 4:15 there is a rehearsal. An hour is left for rewrites before a 6 pm taping in front of a live <b>studio</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 22 October 2009, Griffin {{took part}} in the BBC's topical debate programme, Question Time, as a {{representative}} of the BNP. He appeared alongside Bonnie Greer, Jack Straw, Baroness Warsi and Chris Huhne. He was challenged by members of the <b>studio</b> <b>audience,</b> and questioned by host David Dimbleby on comments he had previously made on the Holocaust. He was also critical of Islam. His invitation followed the election of two BNP MEPs to the European Parliament, and led to significant debate over the merits of the BBC's decision. The appearance sparked a protest outside the BBC Television Centre prior to the recording of the programme, in which an estimated 500 people picketed the front entrance of the complex, many chanting anti-Nazi slogans and others trying to break into the building to stop the programme being filmed. Some got past the police and security, but were expelled. Six protesters were arrested, and three police officers were injured, one needing hospital treatment.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} was split into several stages: auditions, bootcamp, home visits and live shows. Auditions {{in front of}} the show's producers took place throughout March and April 2011. The successful auditionees chosen by the producers were then invited back to the last set of auditions that took place {{in front of the}} judges and a live <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> during May and June. After the auditions was bootcamp, where successful acts were split into four categories: Under 25 Boys (male soloists aged 14 to 24), Under 25 Girls (female soloists aged 14 to 24), Over 25s (soloists aged 25 and over) and Groups. Each judge was given a category to mentor and had to decide on their twelve acts after day two, and their six acts after day three. Special guest judges, including Wynter Gordon, Stephen Belafonte, Darren Hayes and The Veronicas, were brought in to help the judges decide their acts. Following bootcamp was the home visits stage, where each of the judges reduced their six acts to three, with help from more guest judges including Beyoncé, Melanie C, Jason Derulo, Good Charlotte and Leona Lewis. The live shows began on 19 September 2011.|$|E
50|$|Europe '72 (Live), {{released}} in 1997, is a compilation album of live performances by British jazz-rock group If. It features material {{from their first}} four LPs that was recorded live on tour and before <b>studio</b> <b>audiences.</b> The extensive liner notes, giving an exhaustive background on the band, were written by UK music critic Chris Welch.|$|R
50|$|Hole in the Wall began {{recording}} {{episodes in}} mid-May 2008, after being delayed from late April 2008 at Melbourne Central City Studios at the Docklands. The pre-show buzz was highlighted when bigger <b>studio</b> <b>audiences</b> than anticipated {{turned up at}} the first shoots and some had to be turned away. The later episodes' audience numbers were adjusted to cater for the overwhelming demand.|$|R
50|$|Ask the Doctor was {{a program}} where medical {{professionals}} took viewer calls in two-hour time blocks. At launch, AHN had hired 16 doctors, {{seven of them}} from the Orlando area. Shows filmed during Universal Studios theme park hours had <b>studio</b> <b>audiences.</b> By the time AHN ceased producing live series in 1997, it had filmed approximately 7,000 hours of studio shows.|$|R
5|$|The {{episode was}} filmed over three {{days at the}} end of October and {{beginning}} of November 2002. It was supposed to take only two days, but the filming of the wedding scenes was postponed after Messing got sick on the first day. On November 3, 2002, the rooftop terrace scene was filmed at the New York Palace Hotel. In November 2002, the scene in Central Park was shot in New York. The wedding ceremony was filmed, in part, at Temple Israel of Hollywood. As the actors performed their lines in front of a <b>studio</b> <b>audience,</b> the writing staff stood behind the cameras taking notes in the script and watching the audience's reaction to jokes. The writers often stopped the cameras and added new inflections to the dialog. According to the Knoxville News Sentinels Terry Morrow, the cast handled the changes quickly, and scenes were routinely redone up to three times even if the actors executed their lines properly.|$|E
5|$|The episode's teleplay {{was written}} by Shana Goldberg-Meehan & Scott Silveri from a story by Michael Borkow (part one) and Jill Condon & Amy Toomin (part two). The episode's genesis came during the break between seasons three and four, when Channel 4, the British first-run {{broadcaster}} of Friends proposed an episode set in the United Kingdom to the series producers. The proposal fitted neatly with a storyline already being planned, whereby the character of Ross would be married {{at the end of}} the fourth season. The episode was filmed in March 1998 under the direction of executive producer Kevin S. Bright on locations in London, and in front of a live <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> at The Fountain Studios. Scenes featuring Lisa Kudrow's character Phoebe Buffay were filmed on the show's sets in Burbank, California, as Kudrow was too pregnant to fly to London with the rest of the cast. Kudrow gave birth to her son on the day of the episode's original airing.|$|E
5|$|Stewie rams a toy {{spaceship}} into Peter's ear, annoying him, so Peter throws Rupert {{into the}} basement. Stewie follows the bear, discovering an old television script that Brian wrote entitled What I Learned on Jefferson Street. Stewie tosses the script onto the kitchen table, prompting Lois to question {{what it is}} about. Brian suggests she read it and tell him what she thinks. Lois {{falls in love with}} it, and suggests he meet with network executives about producing the show. When Brian pitches it to CBS, the executives respond positively. While the initial casting session goes well, with Elijah Wood auditioning for the lead, the producers assigned by the executives also bring in James Woods, who performs the role in a more comedic fashion, winning over the executives. Brian's serious drama is turned into a sitcom, bringing in a live <b>studio</b> <b>audience</b> as well as a chimpanzee, and renaming it Class Holes. When Brian objects to the changes, the producers remind him of what he had tried to achieve for many years—his own television show—and threaten him with unemployment if he objects to those changes. Disappointed that Brian allowed the executives to change his show so dramatically, Lois demands that he stand up for himself and object to everything James Woods changed about the show. The producers, however, do not take kindly to Brian's desire to start over, so Brian quits in frustration. Brian reveals his disappointment that he no longer has his own television show, but Lois convinces him that it is his integrity that matters. Peter interrupts, with his own show appearing on the screen, entitled Bigger Jaws.|$|E
5000|$|The set-top box, {{then known}} as TV+, was previewed on ABS-CBN's morning show Umagang Kay Ganda on March 22, 2012 where they offered free samples to their <b>studio</b> <b>audiences.</b> Since then, until its {{official}} launch, TV+ was distributed as a prize for the quiz segment of DZMM's [...] "Failon Ngayon sa DZMM" [...] and the [...] "Ang Mahiwagang Blackbox" [...] (The Magical Blackbox).|$|R
50|$|Allen {{became an}} {{announcer}} for KFAC in Los Angeles, {{then moved to}} the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1946, talking the station into airing his five-nights-a-week comedy show Smile Time, co-starring Wendell Noble. After Allen moved to CBS Radio's KNX in Los Angeles, his music-and-talk half-hour format gradually changed to include more talk in an hourlong late-night format, boosting his popularity and creating standing-room-only <b>studio</b> <b>audiences.</b>|$|R
50|$|One notable {{feature of}} the series was a {{considerable}} amount of ad-libbing and breaking up, and—unusually for a filmed sitcom—much of it was left in. (In “Jillson and the Cinnamon Buns,” Besser actually apologizes to Bishop for making him laugh with an off-the-cuff joke.) Because of this, the show's <b>studio</b> <b>audiences</b> were audibly more responsive than those of other multi-camera comedies of the era.|$|R
