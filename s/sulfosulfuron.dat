40|$|Wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{troublesome}} weed species in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) in Iran. Two bioassay experiments were conducted in order to study the response of wild barley and wheat to different herbicides and to study the efficacy of pre-emergence (PRE), postemergence (POST), and PRE followed by POST applications of <b>sulfosulfuron</b> on wild barely. Moreover, the degradation of <b>sulfosulfuron</b> was studied by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The results showed that wild barley was highly tolerant to clodinafop-propargyl and its dry weight was reduced by only 15 %, compared to the control, at the recommended dose (64 g ai ha- 1). <b>Sulfosulfuron</b> reduced the wild barley biomass by 50 % at the highest dose (90 g ai ha- 1) in the first bioassay but by not more than 20 % and 12 % at the recommended dose (22 g ai ha- 1) in the first and second bioassay, respectively. Significant differences were found among the application methods of sulfosulfuron,with the POST application being the least effective method. In contrast to the POST application, wild barley was severely injured by the PRE application of <b>sulfosulfuron,</b> with an ED 50 dose of 7. 3 g ai ha- 1. The degradation study showed that wild barley can metabolize <b>sulfosulfuron</b> that is applied POST, but at a lower rate than wheat. By 4 h after application,wild barley had metabolized 26 % of the <b>sulfosulfuron,</b> compared to 46 % by wheat. In conclusion, wild barley can metabolize the recommended dose of <b>sulfosulfuron</b> that is applied POST; thus, the PRE application of <b>sulfosulfuron</b> or other integrated methods should be considered for the effective control of wild barley in wheat...|$|E

Clodinafop 60  g ha or <b>sulfosulfuron</b> 25  g ha at 35 days after sowing (DAS) and pendimethalin 1000  g ha as pre-emergence did not provide consistently effective control of P. minor in wheat. An increase in the dose of clodinafop from 60 to 75  g ha and of <b>sulfosulfuron</b> from 25 to 30  g ha also did not improve their efficacy to a satisfactory level. However, pinoxaden 50  g ha provided effective control (97 – 100 %) of P. minor but not of broadleaf weeds. The tank-mix application of metribuzin with clodinafop 60  g ha or <b>sulfosulfuron</b> 25  g ha at 35 DAS and the sequential application of pendimethalin 1000  g ha or trifluralin 1000  g ha just after sowing followed by clodinafop 60  g ha or <b>sulfosulfuron</b> 25  g ha at 35 DAS provided 90 – 100 % control of P. minor along with broadleaf weeds in wheat, thus resulting in improved grain yields (4. 72 – 5. 75  t ha) when compared to clodinafop 60  g ha (3. 85 – 5. 60  t ha) or <b>sulfosulfuron</b> 25  g ha alone (3. 95 – 5. 10  t ha).

Effect of twelve selected treatments of four herbicides (clodinafop-propargil, metribuzin, pinoxaden and <b>sulfosulfuron)</b> two-way mixtures at different doses was investigated against fenoxaprop-p-ethyl resistant and susceptible populations of P. minor grown along the wheat plants. In repeated experiment, herbicides mixtures were applied at 3 to 4 leaf stage of P. minor under greenhouse conditions. All the herbicide mixtures were effective to control resistant as well as susceptible P. minor. Mixtures having 75 % lethal dose of each mixture component provided best control against P. minor. Mixtures with 50 % lethal dose of each herbicide also provided more than 80 % control of P. minor. Surviving P. minor plants after exposure to herbicide mixtures showed reduced growth and seed production potential. No mixture combination produced phytotoxic effects on wheat plant up to 75 % of lethal dose of each mixture component. Mixtures including clodinafop-propargil + metribuzin, pinoxaden + <b>sulfosulfuron</b> and pinoxaden + metribuzin at 100 % dose of each mixture component produced minor phytotoxic effects on wheat plants and caused no reduction in terms of ultimate growth and grain yield.

A field experiment was conducted in 2010 and repeated in 2011 in Greece to study the efficacy of herbicides flumioxazin and <b>sulfosulfuron,</b> applied pre- or post-emergence, on field bindweed and redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), as well as their phytotoxicity on potato. Gas chromatography-mass spectrography (GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses were conducted for possible herbicide residues in potato tubers. Also, the efficacy of these herbicides on field bindweed generated from root fragments was investigated in greenhouse pot experiments. In pots, both herbicides provided 78 % to 100 % control of field bindweed generated from root fragments. In field, both herbicides when applied pre-emergence at 72 to 144 g ai ha- 1 provided 65 % to 100 % field bindweed control. However, the corresponding post-emergence applications did not provide satisfactory weed control. All treatments provided excellent control of redroot pigweed. Potato growth was not significantly affected by herbicide application in 2010. However, in 2011, post-emergence applications of flumioxazin caused significant crop injury and yield reduction. The results of this study indicate that satisfactory control of field bindweed and redroot pigweed, as well as high potato yield can be obtained by the pre-emergence application of flumioxazin or <b>sulfosulfuron</b> at 72 to 144 g ai ha- 1, without herbicide residues on potato tubers...|$|E
40|$|Sequential {{applications}} {{of all of}} the ALS-inhibiting herbicides offered acceptable to excellent levels of nutsedge control in turf. Single applications generally provided nutsedge control for 2 to 6 weeks. Single {{applications of}} halosulfuron and flazasulfuron offered effective control for 2 weeks and less than 4 weeks. Effective nutsedge control by trifloxysulfuron and <b>sulfosulfuron</b> was observed at 31 days after treatment (DAT) and began to decline at 42 DAT. <b>Sulfosulfuron</b> at 0. 094 lb a. i. /A applied sequentially at either 4 or 6 weeks gave near complete nutsedge control {{at the end of the}} season at the end of September. A second application of trifloxysulfuron at 0. 026 lb a. i. /A at 4 or 6 weeks after a first application in mid-July resulted in controlling nutsedge better than 85 % at the end of September. Flazasulfuron at 0. 047 lb a. i. /A applied sequentially at 6 weeks provided improving nutsedge control through the summer and resulted in near complete control at 95 % at the end of September.

40|$|A new {{approach}} {{was developed for}} reducing leaching of herbicides and contamination of groundwater. Liposome-clay formulations of the anionic herbicides sulfometuron and <b>sulfosulfuron</b> were designed for slow release by incorporating the herbicide in positively charged vesicles of didodecyldimethylammonium (DDAB), which were adsorbed on the negatively charged clay, montmorillonite. Freeze fracture electron microscopy demonstrated the existence of DDAB vesicles and aggregated structures on external clay surfaces. X-ray diffraction results for DDAB with montmorillonite imply the existence of DDAB bilayers with an oblique orientation to the basal plane within the clay interlayer space at adsorbed amounts beyond the cation exchange capacity of the clay. Adding DDAB with sulfometuron or <b>sulfosulfuron</b> to montmorillonite yielded 95 % or 83 % adsorption of the herbicide at optimal ratios. Liposome-clay formulations exhibited slow release of the herbicides in water. Analytical measurements in soil columns demonstrated 2 - 10 -fold reduction in leaching of the herbicides from liposome-clay formulations in comparison with commercial formulations. Percents of root growth inhibition of a test plant in the upper soil depths were severalfold higher for the liposome-clay formulations than for the commercial ones. Consequently, liposome-clay formulations of anionic herbicides can solve environmental and economical problems by reducing their leaching.

An {{understanding of the}} effect of growth stage on herbicide tolerance of wheat and control of P. minor will help in selecting the most appropriate herbicide for different situations. The weed control and crop safety of four commonly used wheat herbicides (<b>sulfosulfuron,</b> pinoxaden, fenoxaprop plus metribuzin and mesosulfuron plus iodosulfuron), each applied at four different wheat growth stages was investigated in field studies for two years. P. minor plants were at 1, 2 - 3, 3 - 4 and 7 - 8 leaf stages when the herbicides were applied at Zadok 12 -Z 12, Z 13, Z 21 and Z 23 stages of wheat, respectively. <b>Sulfosulfuron</b> application at Z 12 and Z 13 wheat stages (before first irrigation), provided > 80 % control of P. minor and produced wheat grain yield (4. 5 - 4. 7 t/ha) similar to the weed-free check (4. 9 t/ha) in both years. Pinoxaden, fenoxaprop plus metribuzin and mesosulfuron plus iodosulfuron application at Z 12 and Z 13 wheat stages recorded significantly lower wheat grain yield (3. 62 - 3. 95 t/ha) due to poor weed control, crop toxicity or both. All the four herbicides were equally effective on P. minor when applied at Z 21 wheat stage. At Z 23 wheat stage, pinoxaden gave > 90 % control of P. minor and the highest wheat grain yield (4. 82 t/ha).

40|$|Research trials {{performed}} in the greenhouse compared the tolerance and response of Hordeum jubatum and desirable pasture grass species to herbicides, salinity, and flooding. Desirable grass species {{used in this study}} included: `Fawn 2 ̆ 7 tall fescue (Festuca arundinaceae), `Garrison 2 ̆ 7 creeping foxtail (Alopecurus arundinaceus), `Palaton 2 ̆ 7 reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea), `Climax 2 ̆ 7 timothy (Phleum pratense), `Alkar 2 ̆ 7 tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum), `Potomac 2 ̆ 7 orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata), and `Mustang 2 ̆ 7 altai wildrye (Leymus angustus). Tolerance to herbicides, salinity, and flooding varied significantly among grass species. Herbicide tolerance was tested using four herbicides at five rates each. The herbicides used were imazapic (Plateau), propoxycarbazone (Olympus), <b>sulfosulfuron</b> (Outrider), and flucarbazone (Everest) at rates of 0, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 g ha- 1. Foxtail barley was least tolerant of <b>sulfosulfuron</b> and propoxycarbazone. Tall fescue, creeping foxtail, and reed canarygrass were susceptible to all the herbicides tested. Timothy and foxtail barley were moderately tolerant while tall wheatgrass exhibited the greatest tolerance to flucarbazone. Orchardgrass was most tolerant to propoxycarbazone. Salinity tolerance was determined by exposing grasses to increasing electrical conductivity (EC) over time. Reed canarygrass and timothy were most susceptible to salinity. Orchardgrass, creeping foxtail, and tall fescue were moderately tolerant of salinity. Foxtail barley, altai wildrye, and tall wheatgrass exhibited the highest tolerances to salinity, and continued to persist at the highest EC levels tested. Flooding tolerance was determined by flooding grasses in 18 cm of water for 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks.

40|$|Slow release {{formulations}} of the anionic herbicide <b>sulfosulfuron</b> (SFS) were prepared by incorporating it in micelles of an organic cation octadecyltrimethylammonium, which adsorb on the clay-mineral montmorillonite. The fraction of SFS adsorbed on the micelle-clay complex reached 98 %, whereas for monomer-clay complexes, its adsorption was insignificant. Fluorescence studies showed surface {{contact between the}} micelles and the clay surface. The rate of SFS release from the micelle-clay formulations in aqueous suspensions was slow (< 1 %, 72 h). Spraying SFS formulations on a thin soil layer in a funnel, followed by irrigations (50 mm), resulted in complete elution of SFS from the commercial formulation (dispersible granular) versus 4 % from the micelle-clay formulation. A plant bioassay in Rehovot soil showed that these respective formulations yielded 23 and 65 % of shoot growth inhibition of foxtail.

40|$|MON 37532 (<b>sulfosulfuron)</b> {{is a new}} {{herbicide}} for {{the selective}} control of grasses and annual broadleaf weeds in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In this glasshouse study done in 2 -litre pots filled with coarse sand, the product was evaluated for the selective control of Bromus diandrus Roth. in spring wheat. Dosage rates of MON 37532 varying between 0 and 45 g a. i ha- 1, plus 0. 25 % of the surfactant, Agral 90, were applied at the 1 -, 2 -, 3 - and 4 -leaf stage of the weed plants. Although efficient control (> 85 %) was only achieved when weeds were sprayed at the 1 -leaf stage, leaf growth of all B. diandrus plants ceased within 5 days after spraying, irrespective of time of spraying. Leaf area and dry mass determinations done at 6 weeks after spraying in this study confirmed that even if sprayed at the 4 -leaf stage, MON 37532 stops B. diandrus from further growth and competition with the wheat plants.

40|$|A {{field survey}} was {{conducted}} for the sampling of Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitor resistance littleseed canarygrass, a major weed of wheat, from Punjab, Pakistan in 2014 for confirmation of resistance. The surveyed regions encompassed four different cropping systems including rice–wheat, maize–wheat, cotton–wheat and mixed cropping. Dose–response assay was conducted for confirmation of resistance. Efficacy of herbicide mixtures including clodinafop–propargyl, metribuzin, pinoxaden and <b>sulfosulfuron</b> at a range of doses was investigated to manage littleseed canarygrass. Results revealed that all populations were resistant to fenoxaprop except PM-BWL- 2. The higher level resistance (6. 5) was found in populations collected from rice–wheat cropping system. The tested herbicide mixtures at 75 % and 100 % of the recommended dose of each mixture component provided the effective control of resistant littleseed canarygrass. Mixtures at 50 % provided more than 80 % control and reduced growth and seed production potential of surviving plants. The confirmation of ACCase inhibitor resistance as the first case of herbicide resistance in Pakistan, leads us to discourage use of ACCase inhibitor herbicides alone. However, herbicide mixtures at 75 % and 100 % of the recommended dose are suggested to manage this weed for sustainable wheat production in the surveyed cropping systems...|$|E
40|$|Bromus diandrus Roth. {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{troublesome}} weeds in spring wheat crops of the western Cape wheat producing area of the Republic of South Africa and Australia. The selective control of this weed in wheat crops may, in future, be possible with MON 37532 (<b>sulfosulfuron)</b> a new herbicide developed by Monsanto SA. The effect of the relative density of B. diandrus in a wheat crop on the efficacy of this herbicide sprayed at either the 2 - or 6 -leaf stage of the weed was studied in a pot experiment in a temperature-controlled glasshouse. A density of 3 plants pot 1 (170 plants m- 2) was used for the wheat crop, while that of B. diandrus varied between O and 10 plants pot 1 (565 plants m- 2). At early applications (2 -leaf stage), efficacy of MON 37532 improved with higher densities of B. diandrus. This was possibly due to stress conditions created by higher weed densities. This tendency was less evident when MON 37532 was applied at the 6 -leaf stage. Reduced susceptibility in the older plants and less efficient wetting of weeds in pots with high weed densities were probably the reason for reduced percentage control when plants were sprayed at this stage.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if the presence of two ALS inhibiting herbicide residues in three Saskatchewan soils would result in an additive, synergistic, or antagonistic interaction. This was determined through field trials where herbicides were applied sequentially over the course of two years and through dose-response modelling. The herbicides examined in these experiments were imazamethabenz, flucarbazone-sodium, <b>sulfosulfuron,</b> and florasulam, each in combination with imazamox/imazethapyr. The phytotoxicity and persistence of the herbicides in soil was assessed using an Oriental mustard root inhibition bioassay. The determination of herbicide interaction was made through the comparison of the experimentally observed values to theoretically expected values derived from a mathematical equation. The dose response curves created by placing incremental concentrations of these herbicides in soil were compared using the I 50 parameter, which is the concentration resulting in a 50 % reduction in root length. It appeared that soil organic matter followed by soil pH had the greatest effect in reducing herbicide residue phytotoxicity in the tested soils. Based on the bioassay analysis of sequentially applied ALS inhibiting herbicides, it is proposed that the phytotoxic effect of herbicide residues in soil result in additive injury effects rather than synergistic or antagonistic interactions...|$|E

This research was to determine growth characteristics, herbicide efficacy, and seed production of teasel. Growth characteristics were evaluated at two locations by measuring plant dry weight and leaf area. Herbicide efficacy experiments were conducted with four modes of action: amino acid biosynthesis inhibitors, growth regulators, acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors, and cell membrane disrupters. Total seedheads, seeds per primary seedhead and plant were estimated under two levels of intraspecific competition. Plant rosettes stored resources in the taproot and produced larger and fewer leaves compared with reproductive stage plants. Most of the herbicides were highly effective for teasel control ([greater than] 90 %), but ALS inhibitors such as <b>sulfosulfuron</b> and sulfometuron-methyl were ineffective (less 80 %). Seed production reached 33, 500 in plants growing alone and was affected by location, year and growth habit. Primary seedheads produced more than 1000 seeds...|$|E
