30|$|In addition, the {{superfamily}} of MATE proteins {{represents one}} of the largest transporter families in plants, with more than 50 MATE genes in the rice genome. MATEs are secondary active transporters; in plants they have many physiological functions, such as the accumulation of <b>secondary</b> metabolites, <b>aluminium</b> detoxification and iron translocation (Takanashi et al. 2014; Jarzyniak and Jasinski 2014). Some MATEs are involved in hormone signalling in Arabidopsis, such as AtEDS 5, which is responsible for intracellular salycilic acid transport, and AtDTX 50, which functions as an ABA efflux transporter and plays a role in ABA-mediated growth inhibition and responses to drought conditions (Takanashi et al. 2014). In our study, among the 50 genes annotated as MATE efflux family proteins or MATE domain containing proteins, 8 DEGs (7 up- and 1 down-regulated) were specific to Eurosis 3  h-treated roots, and 2 DEGs (both down-regulated) were specific to Loto 3  h-treated roots.

40|$|South African {{coal fly ash}} {{represents}} an untapped <b>secondary</b> resource of <b>aluminium.</b> Continuous research is conducted to develop suitable chemical and/or geometallurgical processes for aluminium extraction, preferably accompanied by minimal silicon extraction. The thermochemical treatment of a South African ultrafine coal fly ash was investigated to test the feasibility of recovering aluminium using ammonium sulphate, a widely available, low-cost, recyclable chemical agent. The optimum processing conditions were determined to be a temperature of 500 °C and a fly ash to ammonium sulphate weight ratio of 2 : 6 when a reaction time of 1 h was used. Water leaching of the reaction product obtained under these conditions resulted in the selective recovery of 95. 0 % aluminium from the amorphous phase, with b 0. 6 % Si extracted. Mullite was unlikely to have reacted with the extracting agent. Except for Si, the process was not element-selective, but the extraction of iron could be minimized by increasing the treatment temperature to 600 °C without compromising Al extraction.

40|$|Three {{aluminium}} alloys from the Al-Si-Fe system were selected {{as an object}} of the present study. The chemistry of the investigated materials, with relatively large additions of iron and silicon, was selected to obtain large volume fractions of iron and silicon containing second phases, which are commonly observed in <b>secondary</b> (recycled) <b>aluminium.</b> Thus, three recycled-like alloys with particle content changing in controlled manner were formed. The three recycle-like Al-Si-Fe alloys were successfully deformed at room temperature by Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) to various strain levels. The effect of particles on the microstructures and mechanical properties due to ECAP deformation and subsequent annealing was analyzed. Moreover, changes to the coarse second phase constituents during plastic deformation were inspected. The results of this work have shown that large particles fracture early during the first ECAP pass, whereas smaller particles require larger plastic strains in the material before they fracture. A rapid particle size reduction during the first ECAP pass proceeds at a slower rate in subsequent passes. Elongated iron-containing phases fractured more readily than the more compact silicon phase. The general tendency was to reduce the aspect ratio of particles, which in turn lowered the loads transmitted to particles through particle-matrix interfaces upon deformation. Analyses of particle rotation phenomena during plastic deformation were approached through statistical measurements and direct observations on the surface of split ECAP samples. The experimental results showed that the average rotation angle of all particles increased with increasing strain. Rotation of elongated particles was shown to be well approximated by a purely geometrical treatment and,in case of ECAP, the rotations can be reasonably described by a simple model taking into account the initial orientations of particles with regard to the shear direction. Compact particles rotated in a more random fashion, what was most probably a consequence of short inter-particle distances leading to complex stress fields and slip patterns in the matrix. Particles were observed to accelerate deformation induced microstructure refinement in their immediate surroundings. In consequence the measured grain size was finer in materials containing larger fractions of coarse particles. Lattice rotations close to separated particles were observed to follow a constant pattern and were assumed to be related to stresses arising from strain incompatibilities between stiff particles and the ductile matrix. Lattice rotations in particle clusters were more randomized what was most probably a consequence of overlapping stress fields from different particles constituting the cluster. Deformation by ECAP led to considerable strengthening and the most significant increase occurred during the first ECAP pass. The increase in strength was accompanied by a reduction in ductility. Generally, a higher strength was obtained after deformation of materials containing larger fraction of coarse second phases. Annealing of deformed materials at low temperatures (T< 130 °C) restored ductility to that of the non-ECAPed condition with little reduction in strength. Prolonged ageing did not improve ductility any further but gradual softening could be observed. At intermediate annealing temperatures (200 °C - 250 °C) the softening was more rapid and so was the strength reduction. Ductility was not improved above that of non-deformed materials until recrystallization occurred. Fully recrystallized materials were observed to have considerably improved plastic properties, indicating the beneficial effect of breakup of the cast microstructures. Microstructures of heavily deformed materials were observed to coarsen upon annealing. The coarsening was relatively uniform during annealing in a low temperature regime. It was similar to the process commonly termed as ‘continuous recovery/ recrystallization’. Annealing at temperatures above ~ 250 °C resulted in discontinuous growth of dislocation free grains nucleated predominantly in particle deformation zones (PDZs). The effect of particles on crystallographic grain orientation distributions was analyzed in both deformed and annealed materials. Textures were shown to be weakened by the presence of coarse particles what suggests that there is a considerable spread of orientations in the PDZs. Textures weakened also upon annealing and the process was observed to be faster in alloys containing more second phase constituents. Analysis of the strain distribution in the shear zone of the ECAP process was performed based on grids and based on microstructural features. The grid based strain measurements documented the large-scale strain variations whereas the microstructure based strain measurements allowed for finer scale observations of strain distribution in deformed state.

40|$|Primary {{aluminium}} production is an energy intensive process, and the aluminiumindustry strives {{to lower the}} energy consumption. However, with the current technology a considerable reduction in the energy consumption is difficult to achieve. Implementation of an inert wettable drained cathode may reduce the energyconsumption for the process considerably. TiB 2 is the inert cathode material which has been considered the most promising and has received most attention. Although TiB 2 does not react with aluminium and has a low solubility in aluminium, limited lifetime during operation has been reported. TiB 2 cathodes have therefore not been introducedon an industrial scale. Degradation during operation is caused by penetration of aluminium along the grain boundaries, and {{has been attributed to}} the reaction between impurity phases in the material and aluminium. This work has focused on the effect ofoxide impurity phases on the microstructural evolution during the sintering process andthe effect of these impurities on the chemical and mechanical stability in an electrolysis cell environment. Moreover, the effect of sintering aids in the form of C, and C combined with Cr and B has also been investigated. The samples were hot pressed at temperatures between 1300 and 1900 °C at 50 MPa for 1 hour in Ar atmosphere. It was first shown that preferential orientation of the TiB 2 grains occurred during hot pressing. Densities around 93 % were achieved for TiB 2 without sintering additions at 1800 °C, and a TiO 1 -x C x solid solution was observed atthe grain boundaries. C was added in order to carbothermally reduce the oxideimpurities present in the TiB 2 powder during hot pressing. Reduction of the oxideimpurities by the addition of C resulted in an increase in the density above 97 %, and the amount of the secondary phase TiO 1 -x C x (ss) was considerably reduced. Excess Caddition relative to the amount necessary for carbothermal reduction of the oxideimpurities resulted in residual C and increased porosity in the materials, whereas toolow C addition resulted in residual TiO 1 -x C x (ss). A method to avoid residual C in the materials was developed. TiB 2 materials without oxide impurities or residual C can be achieved by reaction of the excess carbon with Crand B. It was demonstrated that the desired reactions removing residual oxides and excess carbon occurred, resulting in TiB 2 materials containing the secondary phases(Ti,Cr) C(ss), CrB and (Ti,Cr) B 2 (ss). The degradation resistance of the hot pressed TiB 2 and three commercially available materials was investigated by immersion in liquid aluminium and cryolitic melts, and/or by electrolytic deposition of aluminium on the sample surface. The degradation resistance was dependent on the secondary phases present along the grain boundariesand at triple junctions. Reduction of the mechanical strength and change in fracturemode from transgranular to intergranular was observed after immersion in liquid aluminium. Materials containing oxides or metallic phases along the grain boundaries suffered from severe degradation upon exposure towards liquid aluminium. The volume expansion associated with the reaction between the oxide impurities and aluminium resulted in severe cracking of the material. The metallic sintering aids dissolved readily in liquid aluminium resulting in rapid penetration of aluminium along the grain boundaries. Carbothermal reduction of the oxide impurities increased the degradation resistance in liquid aluminium. The degradation resistance for the materials with C, Cr and B additions was also investigated, and the degradation resistance was dependent on the carbide and boride secondary phases in the material. The materials containing (Ti,Cr) C(ss) and CrB suffered from severe cracking after exposure towards aluminium, and it was proposed that this is due to reactions between these <b>secondary</b> phases and <b>aluminium</b> upon formation of Al 4 C 3 and AlB 2. The(Ti,Cr) B 2 (ss) did, however, not react with aluminium, and the material with this phase along the grain boundaries showed an improved degradation resistance. All thematerials immersed in cryolitic melts suffered from penetration of cryolite along thegrain boundaries. No significant differences in degradation resistance were observedfor the materials with a relatively high amount of oxide impurities and the materials which were stable towards liquid aluminium. The mechanism for the unexpected rapid penetration of the fluoride melt in the materials is still to be investigated. After electrolytic deposition of aluminium, penetration of aluminum was observed at the surface of the materials which were shown to be stable in molten aluminium. This was attributed to the effect of the exposure and penetration of cryolitic melt before the deposition of aluminium occurred. PhD i materialteknologiPhD in Materials Technolog...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of an introduction and five self-contained papers all dealing with {{various aspects of the}} economics of aluminium markets and production. Paper I focuses on various efficiency issues within the global primary aluminium industry. Using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and data for the year 2003, we find that in general primary aluminium smelters are efficient given the scale of operation. However, many smelters operate with increasing returns to scale. Thus, many smelters would lower their average costs if the scale of production was increased. Furthermore, there exist substantial allocative inefficiencies in the industry, i. e., smelters are inefficient in changing the factor set up according to market prices. Overall, there are significant variations in the level of efficiency across smelter locations. Finally, we estimate the potential for factor reductions across smelter technologies and locations. Paper II analyzes the development in total factor productivity (TFP) over the period 1993 - 2003 in the global primary aluminium industry using DEA. The Malmquist indices calculated show that with the exception of Western Europe, smelters in high cost regions have experienced rapid TFP-growth, mainly driven by technical progress and not (as a priori assumed) by efficiency improvements. In regions with rapid capacity build-up, TFP-change is found to be weaker but likewise driven mainly by technical change. Finally, we do not find support for the notion that the dispersion of different smelter technologies affects regional smelter performance. Using a Translog variable cost function model, Paper III examines the ex post factor substitution possibilities in the primary aluminium industry in Western Europe and the Africa-Middle East region (AME) for the period 1990 - 2003. The results indicate higher short-run own- and cross-price elasticities at smelters in the AME region than in Western Europe, at least when it comes to labour and electricity demand. The results also suggest that in both regions the demand for electricity has over time become less sensitive to short-run price changes, while the substitution possibilities between labour and material have increased but only in the AME-region. The liberalization of the Western European electricity markets in combination with the rigid labour markets {{in this part of the}} world suggest that the shift in production capacity from the western world to the AME-region as well as China may continue. Paper IV provides an econometric analysis of the determinants of short-run supply and demand in the Western European market for <b>secondary</b> <b>aluminium</b> for the period 1983 - 1997. The empirical results indicate both price inelastic demand and supply. Policies aimed at increasing aluminium recycling by manipulating price will thus be ineffective considering the low own-price elasticity of secondary supply. However, increased demand for better fuel efficiency and safety in cars might increase the demand for materials with a favourable strength to weight ratio, such as aluminium, thus potentially increasing the demand for <b>secondary</b> <b>aluminium.</b> Finally, Paper V extends the analyzes in Paper IV by; (a) explicitly modelling the interdependencies between the primary and the <b>secondary</b> <b>aluminium</b> markets; (b) estimating <b>secondary</b> <b>aluminium</b> supply in a Cobb-Douglas framework; and (c) modelling aluminium scrap generation. The econometric results indicate that the secondary industry acts like a price taker to the primary aluminium industry. Taking account of the dependencies between input and output prices in <b>secondary</b> <b>aluminium</b> production, we find inelastic supply responses, thus confirming the ineffectiveness of price-driven policies aimed at stimulating recycling. We further calculate a continuously growing stock of scrap. Increased availability of aluminium scrap raises the probability of secondary producers to find the wanted quality, thus lowering the cost of recycling. The impact on supply is however found to be small. Given that increased recycling probably must come from the stock, the low responsiveness of supply from increased scrap availability indicates that attempts to stimulate ‘mining' of the scrap stock may be costly.

40|$|A {{solid waste}} {{coming from the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>aluminium</b> {{industry}} was successfully vitrified in the ternary CaO–Al 2 O 3 –SiO 2 system at 1500 ◦C. This waste is a complex material which is considered hazardous because of its behaviour {{in the presence of}} water or moisture. In these conditions, the dust can generate gases such as H 2, NH 3, CH 4, H 2 S, along with heat and potential aluminothermy. Only silica sand and calcium carbonate were added as external raw materials to complete the glasses formula. Different nominal compositions of glasses, with Al 2 O 3 ranging between 20...|$|E
40|$|Today {{there are}} many {{reactors}} used in refining of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>aluminium.</b> Continuous reactor URC- 7000 is one of them. The model of such reactor was built at 1 : 3 scale. The physical modelling research was conducted {{taking into account the}} flow rate of refining gas and its influence of the dispersion level. There are two nozzles introducing a gas. The carried out tests included the different flow rate of a gas through the nozzles (from 5 to 15 dm 3 /min). Additionally, the mixing characteristics were measured and discussed for different flow rate of an inert gas...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLife cycle {{impact of}} European generic primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>aluminium</b> are well defined. However {{specific}} recycling processes {{are not available}} in literature. In this study, the environmental assessment of cable recycling processing is examined. The data come from a recycling plant (MTB Recycling) in France. MTB process relies only on mechanical separation and optical sorting processes on shredder cables. On the one hand, the study demonstrates huge environmental benefits for aluminium recycled in comparison with primary aluminium. On the other hand, the results show the harmful environmental influence of the heat refining by comparison with cold recycling process...|$|E
