40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} {{the problems of}} instable combustion, serious slag, outfire in boilers with horizontal concentrated boiler, taking a 410 t/h boiler as the sample. Through experimental researches on different adjusting characteristics of horizontal <b>concentrated</b> <b>burners,</b> {{it is found that}} the coal air mixture has different characteristics in velocity and concentration when the baffles are respectively left in the centrifugal or centripetal side of the bent pipes, and that the baffles wear pattern also depends on individual installation location. During many cold and hot commissioning tests, the effective height of baffles is regulated and the original refractory belts are replaced to vertical evenly spaced bare-tube wall. After taking the above measures, the significant problems in the boiler are settled and the economics and safety operation performance is improved considerably. Thus the paper can offer certain references for other boilers with horizontal <b>concentrated</b> <b>burners...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{collective}} modes {{due to the}} propagation of two oppositely moving relativistic jets (dijet) in an anisotropic quark-gluon plasma(AQGP) and compare the results with the case of <b>single</b> <b>jet</b> propagation. For the sake of simplicity, assuming a tsunami-like initial jet distribution, we observe that the dispersion relations for both the stable and unstable modes are altered significantly due {{to the passage of}} dijet in comparison with the case of <b>single</b> <b>jet</b> propagation. It has been further demonstrated that the growth rate of instability, due to introduction of dijet in the system, increases compared to the case of <b>single</b> <b>jet</b> case. As in the case of <b>single</b> <b>jet</b> propagation, the instability always grows when the jet velocity is perpendicular to the wave vector. We, thus, argue that the introduction of dijet in the AQGP, in general, leads to faster isotropization than <b>single</b> <b>jet</b> propagation. Comment: 7 pages, 14 figure...|$|R

This behavior is explained by the radially inward velocity component necessary to support irrotational flow through the turn. Comparison between experimental results and model calculations showed poor agreement due to the model's not including the radial velocity component.

40|$|The planar jet {{has been}} {{proposed}} to reduce the flow-induced noise.

Tandem cylinders are considered as the generic bluff body, which represents the source of flow-induced noise.

40|$|We discuss jet {{substructure}} in recombination algorithms for QCD <b>jets</b> and <b>single</b> <b>jets</b> {{from heavy}} particle decays.

By characterizing these systematic effects and the substructure from QCD, splash-in, and heavy particle decays, we identify a technique, pruning, to better identify heavy particle decays into <b>single</b> <b>jets</b> and distinguish them from QCD jets. Pruning removes protojets typical of soft, wide angle radiation, improves the mass resolution of jets reconstructing a heavy particle decay, and decreases the QCD background.

40|$|The {{signature}} {{produced by}} the Standard Model Higgs boson in the Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) mechanism is usually pinpointed by requiring two well separated hadronic jets, one of which (at least) of them tends {{to be in the}} forward direction.

In this paper the feasibility of <b>single</b> <b>jet</b> tagging is explored in a high-luminosity scenario.
