40|$|Pruning is {{a widely}} {{observed}} mechanism for developing nervous systems to refine their circuitry. During metamorphosis, certain Drosophila sensory neurons undergo large-scale dendrite pruning to remove their larval branches before regeneration of their adult dendrites. Dendrite pruning involves dendrite <b>severing,</b> followed with debris removal. Little {{is known about the}} molecular mechanisms underlying dendrite <b>severing.</b> Here, we show that both the Ik 2 kinase and Katanin p 60 -like 1 (Kat- 60 L 1) of the Katanin family of microtubule <b>severing</b> proteins are required for dendrite <b>severing.</b> Mutant neurons with disrupted Ik 2 function have diminished ability in <b>severing</b> their larval dendrites in pupae. Conversely, premature activation of Ik 2 triggers precocious dendrite <b>severing</b> in larvae, revealing a critical role of Ik 2 in initiating dendrite <b>severing.</b> We found a role for Kat- 60 L 1 in facilitating dendrite <b>severing</b> by breaking microtubule in proximal dendrites, where the dendrites subsequently separate from the soma. Our study thus implicates Ik 2 and Kat- 60 L 1 in dendrite <b>severing</b> that involves local microtubule disassembly...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: INF 2 is a formin protein {{with the}} unique ability to {{accelerate}} both actin polymerization and depolymerization, the latter requiring filament <b>severing.</b> Mutations in INF 2 {{lead to the}} kidney disease focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and the neurological disorder Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMTD). RESULTS: Here, we compare the <b>severing</b> mechanism of INF 2 {{with that of the}} well-studied <b>severing</b> protein cofilin. INF 2, like cofilin, binds stoichiometrically to filament sides and <b>severs</b> in a manner that requires phosphate release from the filament. In contrast to cofilin, however, INF 2 binds ADP and ADP-Pi filaments equally well. Furthermore, two-color total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy reveals that a low number of INF 2 molecules, as few as a single INF 2 dimer, are capable of <b>severing,</b> while measurable cofilin-mediated <b>severing</b> requires more extensive binding. Hence, INF 2 is a more potent <b>severing</b> protein than cofilin. While a construct containing the FH 1 and FH 2 domains alone has some <b>severing</b> activity, addition of the C-terminal region increases <b>severing</b> potency by 40 -fold, and we show that the WH 2 -resembling DAD motif is responsible for this increase. Helical 3 D reconstruction from electron micrographs at 20  Å resolution provides a structure of filament-bound INF 2, showing that the FH 2 domain encircles the filament.

40|$|International audienceVillin, an actin-binding protein {{associated}} with the actin bundles that support microvilli, bundles, caps, nucleates and <b>severs</b> actin in a calcium-dependant manner in vitro. We hypothesized that the <b>severing</b> activity of villin is responsible for its reported role in enhancing cell plasticity and motility. To test this hypothesis, we chose a loss of function strategy and introduced mutations in villin based on sequence comparison with CapG. By pyrene-actin assays, we demonstrate that this mutant has a strongly reduced <b>severing</b> activity whereas nucleation and capping remain unaffected. The bundling activity and the morphogenic effects of villin in cells are also preserved in this mutant. We thus succeeded in dissociating the <b>severing</b> from the three other activities of villin. The contribution of villin <b>severing</b> to actin dynamics is analyzed in vivo through the actin-based movement of the intracellular bacteria Shigella flexneri in cells expressing villin and its <b>severing</b> variant. The <b>severing</b> mutations abolish the gain of velocity induced by villin. To further analyze this effect, we reconstituted an in vitro actin-based bead movement in which the usual capping protein is replaced by either the WT or the <b>severing</b> mutant of villin. Confirming the in vivo results, villin <b>severing</b> activity enhances the velocity of beads by more than two folds and reduces the density of actin in the comets. We propose a model in which, by <b>severing</b> actin filaments and capping their barbed-ends, villin increases the concentration of actin monomers available for polymerization, a mechanism that might be paralleled in vivo when an enterocyte undergoes an epithelio-mesenchymal transition...|$|R

40|$|The {{youngest}} {{parts of}} clonal plants benefit from substantial physiological support from older parts, but {{the extent to}} which this physiological dependence persists through time is poorly understood. The development of autonomy among connected subunits was therefore analysed in the clonal species Glechoma hederacea. The stolons of a series of clonal fragments with differing numbers of primary ramets were <b>severed</b> at a fixed point relative to the four oldest primary ramets. The subsequent growth of both parts of the <b>severed</b> fragments was compared with that of a series of intact fragments. The growth of apical stolon portions that included five or more rooted primary ramets at the time of <b>severing</b> was unaffected by <b>severing.</b> Apical portions with three or fewer rooted ramets at the time of <b>severing</b> produced fewer new primary ramets than equivalent parts of intact fragments, while apical portions with four or fewer rooted ramets produced less above-ground mass than equivalent apical portions of intact clonal fragments. Basal portions of clonal fragments <b>severed</b> when there were one or two rooted ramets in the apical portion produced more secondary ramet mass than equivalent parts of intact fragments. The gain in mass of secondary ramets in the basal portions of <b>severed</b> fragments matched the reduction in mass of secondary ramets in the apical portions. However, <b>severing</b> caused an overall loss of mass when apical portions had three or fewer rooted ramets at the time of <b>severing,</b> because the mass of primary ramets in basal portions did not increase following <b>severing.</b> <b>Severing</b> had little impact on the allometry of the apical portions. The relationship between mass in secondary ramets and mass in primary ramets was similar in the apical portions of <b>severed</b> and intact clonal fragments. None of the <b>severing</b> treatments increased the total mass of secondary ramets, suggesting that apical dominance in this species only affects branches very close to the apex. These observations, combined with existing knowledge of vascular architecture in G. hederacea, demonstrate that, whether or not physical connections persist between ramets, growing stolons rapidly develop into physiologically autonomous segments. This may be a characteristic of species that exploit disturbed, spatially heterogeneous habitats through rapid multiplication of ramets connected by long, aerial runners or stolons...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>severing</b> of microtubules by katanin is {{regulated}} by nucleotide exchange factors, which can exchange ADP with ATP, protective microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), and the p80 subunit (p60 <b>severs</b> microtubules {{much better in}} the presence of p80). These mechanisms have different consequences, depending on where in the cell they are activated or disrupted. For example, allowing katanin-mediated <b>severing</b> at the centrosome releases microtubules for free movement. In one experiment, anti-katanin antibodies were injected into a cell, causing a large accumulation of microtubules around the centrosome and inhibition of microtubule outgrowth. [...] Therefore, katanin-mediated <b>severing</b> may serve to maintain organization in the cytoplasm by promoting microtubule disassembly and efficient movement.

5000|$|Villin is {{believed}} to function in the bundling, nucleation, capping and <b>severing</b> of actin filaments. [...] In vertebrates, the villin proteins help to support the microfilaments of the microvilli of the brush border. However, knockout mice appear to show ultra-structurally normal microvilli reminding us that the function of villin is not definitively known; it {{may play a role}} in cell plasticity through F-actin <b>severing.</b> [...] The six-repeat villin core is responsible for Ca2+ actin <b>severing</b> while the headpiece is responsible for actin crosslinking and bundling (Ca independent). Villin is postulated to be the controlling protein for Ca2+ induced actin <b>severing</b> in the brush border. Ca2+ inhibits proteolytic cleavage of the domains of the 6 N-terminal core which inhibits actin <b>severing.</b> [...] In normal mice raising Ca2+ levels induces the <b>severing</b> of actin by villin, whereas in villin knockout mice this activity does not occur in response to heightened Ca2+ levels. [...] In the presence of low concentrations of Ca2+ the villin headpiece functions to bundle actin filaments whereas in the presence of high Ca2+ concentrations the N-terminal caps and <b>severs</b> these filaments. [...] The association of PIP2 with villin inhibits the actin capping and <b>severing</b> action and increases actin binding at the headpiece region, possibly through structural changes in the protein. PIP2 increases actin bundling not only by decreasing the <b>severing</b> action of villin but also through dissociating capping proteins, releasing actin monomers from sequestering proteins and stimulating actin nucleation and cross linking.|$|R
