50|$|CTA's Automated Fare Collection (AFC) {{system was}} {{installed}} in 1997 by Cubic Transportation Systems, Inc., the largest provider of AFC systems in the USA.

A small pilot program (“Chicago Gold”) for reduced-fare disabled riders in 1999 led to a contract with Cubic to install <b>smart</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> universally in 2000. In August 2000, a more extensive “Chicago Card” pilot program distributed stored-value <b>smart</b> <b>cards</b> to volunteer participants. The pilot program was expanded system-wide in November 2002. The Chicago Card Plus debuted in January 2004. “Go Lane” <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> were installed in the buses, starting in 2005, allowing Chicago Card users to bypass the line of passengers using the farebox; however, only one payment could be accepted at a time, eliminating this possible efficiency.
