Other cyclopyrrolone drugs include <b>suriclone.</b> Zopiclone, {{although}} molecularly different from benzodiazepines, shares an almost identical pharmacological profile as benzodiazepines, including anxiolytic properties. Its mechanism of action is by binding to the benzodiazepine site and acting as a full agonist, which in turn positively modulates benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAA receptors and enhances GABA binding at the GABAA receptors to produce zopiclone's pharmacological properties. In addition to zopiclone's benzodiazepine pharmacological properties, it also has some barbiturate-like properties.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of action by which <b>suriclone</b> produces its sedative and anxiolytic effects is by modulating GABAA receptors, although <b>suriclone</b> is more subtype-selective than most benzodiazepines.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Suriclone</b> (Suril) is a {{sedative}} and anxiolytic {{drug in the}} cyclopyrrolone {{family of}} drugs. Other cyclopyrrolone drugs include zopiclone and pagoclone.|$|E
5000|$|Suproclone is a {{sedative}} and anxiolytic {{drug in the}} cyclopyrrolone {{family of}} drugs, developed by the French pharmaceutical company Rhône-Poulenc. Other cyclopyrrolone drugs include zopiclone, pagoclone and <b>suriclone.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Suriclone</b> has a {{very similar}} {{pharmacological}} profile to the benzodiazepine family of drugs including sedative and anxiolytic properties but with less amnestic effects, and its chemical structure {{is quite different from}} that of the benzodiazepine drugs.|$|E
50|$|Suproclone is {{very similar}} in {{structure}} to the related drug <b>suriclone,</b> but little information has been published about it specifically. However it can be expected that the mechanism of action by which suproclone produces its sedative and anxiolytic effects is by modulating benzodiazepine receptors (resulting in an increased response to endogenous GABA), {{in a similar manner}} to other drugs of this class.|$|E
50|$|More recently, a {{range of}} non-sedating {{anxiolytic}} drugs derived from the same structural families as the Z-drugs have been developed, such as alpidem (Ananyxl) and pagoclone, and approved for clinical prescription. Nonbenzodiazepine drugs are much more selective than the older benzodiazepine anxiolytics, producing effective relief of anxiety/panic {{with little or no}} sedation, anterograde amnesia, or anticonvulsant effects, and are thus potentially more precise than older, anti-anxiety drugs. However, anxiolytic nonbenzodiazepines are not widely prescribed and many have collapsed after initial clinical trials and consumption halted many projects, including but not limited to alpidem, indiplon, and <b>suriclone.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{pharmacological properties}} of zopiclone include hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and myorelaxant properties. Zopiclone and benzodiazepines bind {{to the same}} sites on GABAA-containing receptors, causing an enhancement {{of the actions of}} GABA to produce the therapeutic and adverse effects of zopiclone. The metabolite of zopiclone called desmethylzopiclone is also pharmacologically active, although it has predominately anxiolytic properties. One study found some slight selectivity for zopiclone on α1 and α5 subunits, although it is regarded as being unselective in its binding to α1, α2, α3, and α5 GABAA benzodiazepine receptor complexes. Desmethylzopiclone has been found to have partial agonist properties, unlike the parent drug zopiclone, which is a full agonist. The mechanism of action of zopiclone is similar to benzodiazepines, with similar effects on locomotor activity and on dopamine and serotonin turnover.A meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials that compared benzodiazepines to zopiclone or other Z drugs such as zolpidem and zaleplon has found few clear and consistent differences between zopiclone and the benzodiazepines in sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, rebound insomnia, and daytime alertness.Zopiclone is in the cyclopyrrolone family of drugs. Other cyclopyrrolone drugs include <b>suriclone.</b> Zopiclone, although molecularly different from benzodiazepines, shares an almost identical pharmacological profile as benzodiazepines, including anxiolytic properties. Its mechanism of action is by binding to the benzodiazepine site and acting as a full agonist, which in turn positively modulates benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAA receptors and enhances GABA binding at the GABAA receptors to produce zopiclone's pharmacological properties.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the cyclopyrrolones {{zopiclone}} and <b>suriclone</b> on {{the function of the}} central gamma-amino-butyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor complex in mouse brain were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Added in vitro to mouse cerebral cortical membranes, these compounds potently inhibited [3 H]flumazenil binding with IC 50 (50 % inhibitory concentration) values of 35. 8 nM (zopiclone) and 1. 1 nM (<b>suriclone).</b> Similar results were obtained with cerebellar membranes, indicating that these drugs do not discriminate between putative type I and type II benzodiazepine receptors. The interaction of cyclopyrrolones with recognition sites present {{at the level of the}} GABA receptor complex appears to be competitive, because zopiclone decreased the affinity of the receptors for [3 H]flumazenil without affecting the maximal number of binding sites. Moreover, zopiclone and <b>suriclone</b> did not affect the rate of dissociation of [3 H]flumazenil from benzodiazepine receptors. The in vitro efficacy of zopiclone appeared different from that of <b>suriclone</b> and the benzodiazepines diazepam and flunitrazepam. Thus, zopiclone failed to affect muscimol-stimulated 36 Cl- uptake and only slightly inhibited t-[35 S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35 S]TBPS) binding. In contrast, like diazepam and flunitrazepam, <b>suriclone</b> increased muscimol-stimulated 36 Cl- uptake and markedly inhibited [35 S]TBPS binding. In contrast, like diazepam and flunitrazepam, <b>suriclone</b> increased muscimol-stimulated 36 Cl- uptake and markedly inhibited [35 S]TBPS binding. On the other hand, <b>suriclone,</b> like zopiclone, did not modify [3 H]muscimol binding to mouse cerebral cortical membranes. Moreover, zopiclone antagonized the reduction in [35 S]TBPS binding elicited by the benzodiazepine receptor full of agonist diazepam. Consistent with its low efficacy in vitro, oral administration of zopiclone (2. 5 to 100 mg/kg, p. o.) in mice failed to modify [35 S]TBPS binding subsequently measured in cerebral cortical membranes "ex vitro".

40|$|The {{interactions}} of zopiclone and <b>suriclone,</b> representatives of nonbenzodiazepine cyclo-pyrrolone anxiolytics, with central-type benzodiazepine receptors have been characterized in rat and bovine brain. While zopiclone potently (IC 50 nM) inhibits [3 H]Ro- 15 - 1788 binding {{in an apparent}} mass action fashion, <b>suriclone</b> and its metabolite 35, 489 RP are extremely potent (IC. t) 350 pM and 1 nM, respectively) and display Hill coefficients of approximately 2. 0. Like classical benzodiazepines, none of the cyclopyrrolones studied display selectivity for type I or type II benzodiazepine receptors. Using [3 H]suriclone, saturable high affinity sites for cyclopyrrolone anxiolytics were directly labeled in rat and bovine brain. The regional distribution and pharmacologic specificity of [3 H]suriclone and [3 H]Ro- 15 - 1788 binding sites are similar, suggesting that [3 H]suriclone recognition sites reside on the benzodiazepine receptor complex. Unlike classical benzodiazepine agonists, such as diazepam, the binding of [3 Hjsuriclone is not modulated by GABA, Cl, pentobartibal, or tracazolate. Unlike those of [3 H]diazepam, [3 H]suriclone-binding sites are only minimally affected by photoaffinity labeling with flunitrazepam. Whereas the binding affinities of [3 H]Ro- 15 - 1788, [3 H]flunitrazepam, and [3 Hjethyl fl-carboline 3...|$|E
40|$|In a four-week {{double-blind}} randomized trial {{preceded by}} a one-week single-blind placebo treatment, the efficacy and the side-effects of <b>suriclone</b> (1. 50 - 2. 25 mg/d) (n = 24), lorazepam (5. 0 - 7. 5 mg/d) (n = 19) and placebo (n = 21) were compared in 64 outpatients with a DSM-III diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (n = 56) or panic disorder (n = 8). Efficacy was measured weekly {{by means of a}} global clinical impression scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the Zung Anxiety Self-Assessment Scale and a target symptom scale. Side-effects were evaluated weekly by an adverse events scale, which recorded the spontaneous complaints and the complaints elicited by an extensive somatic inventory questionnaire. The three groups showed a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement early on in the treatment: this improvement was maintained during the remaining period. Early on in the treatment there was some indication of a better response, but also of more side-effects, in the <b>suriclone</b> and the lorazepam groups. After four weeks of treatment no difference was found between the three groups either in efficacy or in side-effects.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a variety of minor tranquilizers and of benzodiaze-pine inverse {{agonists}} on the stress-induced increase in frontal cortical dopamine metabolism have been studied in the rat. Electric footshock stress increased 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels in the frontal (but not panetal) cortex and in the nucleus accumbens but not in the striatum or ventral teg-mental area. Similar stress-induced alterations of frontal cortical DOPAC levels were observed after DSP 4 -induced noradrenergic denervation or after adrenalectomy. Other types of stress, e. g. conditioned fear (exposure to an environment paired previously with footshock) or swim stress also provoked an elevation of DOPAC levels in the prefrontal cortex.
