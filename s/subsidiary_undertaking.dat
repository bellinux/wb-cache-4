40|$|We {{investigate}} R&D subsidiary isolation within Multinational Corporations (MNCs) {{competing in}} knowledge-intensive industries. For such MNCs, accessing knowledge and nurturing the innovative potential of R&D subsidiaries {{is vital for}} on-going competitiveness. This, according to conventional thinking, requires integration of the subsidiary within the host country as well as internally within the MNC. Recent studies have shown, however, that overseas subsidiaries can become isolated (i. e., losing requisite integration), even in high-technology sectors. We tackle this issue by focusing on organizational factors at corporate and subsidiary levels that {{have the potential to}} explain subsidiary isolation. We analyze a sample of 45 foreign-owned Austrian <b>subsidiaries</b> <b>undertaking</b> R&D in knowledge-intensive industries using a combination of questionnaire and secondary data. The results suggest that parent and subsidiary experience, the degree of early-stage research conducted by the subsidiary and the use of training and rotation practices by the subsidiary, all act to counter isolation. Interestingly, we find that proximity between parent and R&D subsidiary does not {{play a significant role in}} predicting isolation.

In 1995, R&D expenditures by Canadian affiliates, {{only in the}} United States, represented some US$ 1. 4 billion and employed some 6300 persons. Nearly 60 Canadian-owned and-controlled corporations conduct overseas R&D, mostly in the US, Western Europe, Japan, and Australia. Canadian corporations are performing commercial R&D abroad {{in order to support}} their manufacturing subsidiaries and to come closer to customers and markets. A secondary motivation is to hire skilled personnel, monitor foreign technological development and increase the inflow of new ideas into the corporation. They also chose friendly socio-political environments from a regulatory point of view. Technology transfer and adaptation to local markets is also an important mission of the foreign R&D establishment. Foreign R&D activities of Canadian firms are fairly decentralized and autonomous. Most of the foreign <b>subsidiaries</b> <b>undertook</b> R&D abroad before they were acquired by the Canadian corporation; also the number of Canadian managers was reduced and the R&D projects were usually decided in the affiliate. Three main types of expatriate R&D were found: a majority of the subsidiaries were producing goods in the same or related. industries as in Canada such as machines, transportation equipment or housing equipment. A second group of firms were vertically integrated firms, that conducted process research in Canada and advanced materials and final products research abroad, closer to the markets for this type of goods; they were active in the chemical and metal industries.

Of those, the first two were to be produced for the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War, which Raab supported, while the third probably remained a design. Raab {{had to deal with}} the complications of supplies to Spain in that period (non-intervention treaty); a commercial office of the Greek company was set up in Paris, while a subsidiary was created in Spain. The main and more complex parts and equipment of the aircraft were built in Athens (parts of the construction were undertaken by Pyrkal, while KEA equipment were also used) and shipped to Spain. Residents of Moschato described seeing truckloads of aircraft parts leaving the factory, obviously heading to ships destined for Spain, while others complained for the continuous noise made during testing of aircraft engines in the factory. Once in Spain, the local <b>subsidiary</b> <b>undertook</b> assembly and fitting of certain parts, in a former textile factory in Sabadell under Raab's supervision (according to some reports, a number of planes were shipped from Greece almost completely finished, the only remaining step being fitting of engines and machine guns). According to Raab, a total of 60 (i.e., 30 of each type) aircraft were almost finished, when they were shipped, along with the construction plans, to the USSR. Raab was arrested as a [...] "German spy", but managed to escape and returned to Greece in 1938.|$|R

However, {{it is not yet}} known {{what is the relationship between}} entrepreneurial (or innovative) parent firms and their subsidiaries, and why some subsidiaries are allowed to implement entrepreneurial activities while others are not. The current dissertation tries to find the answer of these questions by interweaving the institutional theory and the entrepreneurial orientation theory. The former is applied in order to explain the influence of the external environment on the subsidiaries’ actions, whereas the latter helps to elucidate the nature of entrepreneurial practices. This dissertation also presents an exploratory research design, and the study consists of five semi-structured interviews with managers from Bulgaria. The findings suggest that there are three main factors that restrict domestic <b>subsidiaries</b> to <b>undertake</b> entrepreneurial activities which are market size, host country’s business environment, and corporate policy. The observations indicate, too, that although corporate policy appears to be the most decisive factor, it can be influenced by the other two.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} under what combinatorial factors of institutions and power relations within the multinational corporation (MNC), localization of human resource management (HRM) practices occurs. I conceptualize localization as modifications of headquarters-transferred practices that foreign <b>subsidiaries</b> <b>undertake</b> to respond to the local environment. By incorporating a power perspective into institutional theory, I aim to advance institutional analysis of practice transfer in a configurational manner. I conducted a multiple case study with thirteen subsidiaries that were operating in China and owned by Finnish MNCs. Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) was applied as a research approach and crisp-set QCA as an analytical tool to the case study. The configurational nature of QCA and its ability to draw causality while keeping some degree of causal complexity are well suited to investigate the research phenomenon. A key contribution of the present study is the very configurational explanation that sheds light on why and how various constellations of institutions and headquarters-subsidiary power relationships lead to localization of HRM practices. The configurational explanation captures the specific context of practice transfer from a developed market economy to a transition economy. Moreover, this study applies QCA at the micro-level analysis which is a novel approach in International Business research. I specified four causal conditions: labour market mobility, location, monitoring by headquarters and strategic role of subsidiary. The localization of compensation as an HRM practice resulted from the combination of these four conditions with pressure from high labour market mobility, unattractive location of the subsidiary, weak monitoring by headquarters and the strategic role of the subsidiary. No single factor alone played a decisive role. Further, four different configurations that led to localization of compensation were identified, highlighting alternative pathways to achieve the same outcome. The study demonstrates that while institutional differences between host and home country induced the need for localization, power relationships between headquarters and subsidiary also played an important role. The combined effect explains why a practice is either localized or standardized. The study shows a high propensity to transfer of compensation and performance management practices from Finland to China among the Finnish MNCs. However, the subsidiaries were generally rather loosely monitored by their headquarters, reflecting the relatively decentralized management style employed. The study also provides up-to-date empirical evidence that high labour mobility in China is a significant driving force for localization. Similarly, an unattractive location increases the need for localizing corporate practices, which demonstrates the importance of sub-national institutions in China. Furthermore, the rapid changes of values and the growing heterogeneity of the Chinese workforce call for localization of HRM practices...|$|R

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{presents}} an ongoing empirical study into strategy {{development at the}} subsidiary management level of the Multinational Enterprise (MNE). The multinational subsidiary is a unique context to study management processes relating to strategy but so far, despite {{the emergence of the}} concept, {{there has not been a}} coherent approach identifiable in the literature. It is recognised that subsidiaries evolve over time and through their own actions and initiatives have the potential to modify the power structures of the Multinational Enterprise (MNE) but little is known about the role of the subsidiary manager in this process. We suggest that the tensions between the headquarters perspective and the subsidiary perspective have resulted in the application of inappropriate frameworks to the study of subsidiary managers. We propose that, the unique position which the subsidiary manager occupies within the overall context of the MNE requires the application of a specific framework which reflects this reality. The subsidiary manager performs the role of a middle manager within the overall MNE structure. To analyse this role we have adapted a framework of middle manager strategy development based on Floyd and Wooldridge’s (1992,, 1997) seminal work in the field of middle manager research. The framework outlined in this study extends Floyd and Wooldridge’s work to include three different types of Middle Manager Strategic activity; Upward, Downward and Horizontal. The items in the survey were developed particularly for the multinational subsidiary context. The model tests subsidiary manager’s engagement in strategy, the antecedents, and the outcomes of that role. A large scale mail survey of the entire population of multinational <b>subsidiary</b> was <b>undertaken</b> to test the model. Data analysis is currently underway. Applying the middle manager perspective to the subsidiary manager opens up the possibility to make important theoretical contributions to a number of research streams. Firstly, from an international business perspective, the middle manager framework could unlock valuable insights into how subsidiary managers engage in strategic activity. Secondly, for the strategy field, there is an opportunity to apply the middle manager framework of strategy development to a specific and underexplored setting. From a practitioner perspective there is potential to identify the distinctive abilities required to be a successful subsidiary manager in today’s global environment. The importance of these managers cannot be overstated. Their relative success in enacting their role can provide benefit to their own subsidiary unit, the global MNE, and the local economy in which they operate. A greater understanding of how they engage in this process may reveal the true value of the Subsidiary General Manager...|$|R
