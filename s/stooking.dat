50|$|In this painting, {{the whole}} {{countryside}} is marked out in blue squares {{that seems like}} a chessboard. All of the activities are picturesquely grouped around a golden blaze such as men doubled over, women hurrying along the narrow paths and people <b>stooking</b> sheaves of corn and loading carts. The artist has not used paint to highlight a furrow everywhere and make them glint in the light.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} a {{compilation}} of short scenes, with titles including [...] "Six Binders at Work in Hundred Acre Wheatfield", [...] "Harvesting Scene, with Trains Passing By", [...] "Pacific and Atlantic Mail Trains" [...] and [...] "Arrival of CPR Express at Winnipeg". Other scenes whose titles are not confirmed reportedly depicted Freer's own home and family, as well as footage of Thomas Greenway, the Premier of Manitoba, <b>stooking</b> grain on his own farm.|$|E
50|$|The Manitoba Historical Society has, however, {{confirmed}} {{that at least}} part of Freer's film appears to have consisted of footage filmed by other people; several months earlier, a Winnipeg bartender named Richard Hardie, an American filmmaker named E. H. Amet and entertainment producer named Cosgrove were known to have been exhibiting kinetographs in various Manitoba communities that included farm harvesting footage, including Greenway <b>stooking</b> grain, although they engaged in a dispute through letters to the Winnipeg Free Press as to who had been the creator of the films. Freer appears to have acquired their films, and included them in Ten Years in Manitoba along with some of his own original footage.|$|E
5000|$|By November 1940, {{after the}} first harvest which the Women's Land Army was largely {{responsible}} for bringing in, Men <b>Stooking</b> and Girls Learning to Stook had appeared, and WVS exploitation of that summer's excellent fruit crop was recognised in A Canning Demonstration (approx. 1'8" [...] x 2': 51 x 61 cm: IWM). Among her November 1940 submissions to the WAAC was A Knitting Party (approx. 1' 6" [...] x 1' 8": 46 x 51 cm: IWM), painted {{in the drawing room}} of the Dunbar house in Rochester and featuring some fifteen women, including Dunbar's mother Florence (the only hatless woman, surreptitiously looking at her watch), knitting blankets or comforters in service colours.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the ridge}} and on {{the margin of the}} parish, the wood was {{conveniently}} placed so that heavy loads of timber were brought down the gentle slope to supply the rest of the parish. Also, it lay beyond the fields where the daily labour of ploughing, weeding and harvest required frequent attendance from the houses of the town. Going for wood was an important job; part of the initial endowment of Bourne Abbey was [...] "two big faggots, such as might be carried on the back, of the larger branches, to be taken every day out of Bourne Wood without interference". Fetching timber was important but done less frequently than sod-breaking, crow scaring, weeding, ploughing, harrowing, sowing, reaping, <b>stooking,</b> straw-carting and pasturing in the stubble of the arable fields.|$|E
5000|$|During the war Dunbar {{continued}} {{painting and}} exhibiting privately. In {{the summer of}} 1942 she exhibited Kentish Landscape and Mrs Dunbar and the Snog at the Suffolk Street Galleries in London. The whereabouts of these paintings is currently unknown. More significantly, in 1943 she exhibited Joseph's Dreams (1' 6" [...] x 2' 6": 46 x 76 cm: Cambridgeshire County Council), a imaginative diptych illustrating the Genesis story of Joseph dreaming that eleven stooks of corn and eleven stars, representing his eleven brothers, paid homage to him. The corn stooks are strongly reminiscent of the stooks in Dunbar's earlier painting, Men <b>Stooking</b> and Girls Learning to Stook. In both scenes Joseph is wearing his coat of many colours, and the dream-background is of fertile fields and well-cared-for plantations: Dunbar's convictions of the synergy between man and Nature are expressed once again.|$|E
5000|$|In North America, a stook {{may also}} {{refer to a}} field stack of six, ten or fifteen small (70 - 90 lb), {{rectangular}} bales of hay or straw. These bales may be stacked and deposited by a [...] "stooking machine" [...] or [...] "stooker" [...] that is dragged, sled-like, behind the baler. The <b>stooking</b> sled has four, five, or six fingers that hold the bales until the stook is complete. When the stook is complete the [...] "stacker" [...] steps on a lever to release the stook. The fingers drop {{to the ground and}} the finished stook slides off the fingers. The sled resets itself and is ready to be filled again. The bales are stacked on the diagonal to shed the rain and to minimise acquiring moisture from the ground before being picked up. An automatic bale stooker was eventually designed to eliminate the need for a person to manually stack and trip the stook-release. The automatic stooker is positioned behind the baler and collects released bales and sends them up an inclined shute. The bale falls through a series of bars into the [...] "3-2-1" [...] configuration. Once all six bales are in position the platform trips, drops the stook in the field, and automatically returns to the loading position. [...] Allied produced a model of stooked in the 1980s that can still be found across the countryside in Canada today.|$|E
