50|$|<b>Satraplatin</b> is a prodrug, {{meaning it}} is metabolized {{in the body}} and {{transformed}} into its working form. The two polar acetate groups on <b>satraplatin</b> increase the drugs bioavailability, which in turn allows for a large fraction of the administered dose to make it into the bloodstream where metabolism begins. Once the molecule makes it to the bloodstream the drug loses its acetate groups. At this point the drug is structurally similar to cisplatin {{with the exception of one}} cyclohexylamine group in place of an amine group. Since the drug is now structurally similar to cisplatin its mechanism of action is also very similar. The chlorine atoms are displaced and the platinum atom in the drug binds to guanine residues in DNA. This unfortunately happens to not only cancer cells but other regular functioning cells as well causing some of the harsh side effects. By binding to guanine residues <b>satraplatin</b> inhibits DNA replication and transcription which leads to subsequent apoptosis. Where <b>satraplatin</b> differs is its cyclohexamine group. In cisplatin the two amine groups are symmetrical while satraplatin's cyclohexamine makes it asymmetrical which contributes to some of the drug's special properties.|$|E

50|$|A large {{problem with}} {{cisplatin}} and other platinum based anti-cancer drugs {{is that the}} body can develop resistance to them.

As men who have progressed after docetaxel and prednisone have an expected median survival of approximately 12 months, there is great opportunity for improved palliation in this disease. <b>Satraplatin</b> may provide a palliative benefit for these men in terms of progression-free survival {{according to the most recent}} analyses of the phase III SPARC trial comparing <b>satraplatin</b> and prednisone to prednisone alone in the second-line setting for HRPC, and is currently under USFDA review for this indication. Whether <b>satraplatin</b> and prednisone offer an advantage over docetaxel retreatment or other cytotoxic agents in this setting is an unanswered question and worthy of study. Investigation of predictors of platinum sensitivity and the use of <b>satraplatin</b> in patients with neuroendocrine subsets of metastatic prostate cancer may be warranted given the advances in biomarker and genomic technology and the known sensitivity of small cell cancers to platinum agents.

40|$|Background The role {{of organic}} anion {{transporting}} polypeptide 5 A 1 (OATP 5 A 1) {{a member of}} a family of drug transporters that mediate cellular uptake of drugs has not been characterized so far. Methods Gene expression levels of OATP 5 A 1 in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines were determined by real-time qPCR and chemosensitivity of HEK- 293 - SLCO 5 A 1 -transfected cells to <b>satraplatin</b> in MTT assays. Results Significant expression of this transporter was found at the mRNA level, primarily in drug-resistant SCLC cells, and SLCO 5 A 1 - transfected HEK- 293 cells showed higher resistance to <b>satraplatin.</b> OATP 5 A 1 is found preferentially in cytoplasmic membranes of tumor cells, including SCLC. Conclusions OATP 5 A 1 seems to effect intracellular transport of drugs and may participate in chemoresistance of SCLC by sequestration, rather than mediating cellular uptake.

40|$|Oxaliplatin, <b>satraplatin,</b> and picoplatin are {{cisplatin}} analogs that {{interact with}} DNA forming intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links (ICLs). Replicative bypass of cisplatin DNA adducts requires the cooperative actions {{of at least}} three translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) polymerases: Pol, REV 1, and Pol. Be-cause oxaliplatin, <b>satraplatin,</b> and picoplatin contain bulkier chemical groups attached to the platinum core compared with cisplatin, we hypothesized that these chemical additions may impede replicative bypass by TLS polymerases and reduce tolerance to platinum-containing adducts. We examined multi-ple responses of cancer cells to oxaliplatin, <b>satraplatin,</b> or pi-coplatin treatment under conditions where expression of a TLS polymerase was limited. Our studies revealed that, although Pol contributes to the tolerance of cisplatin adducts, it plays a lesser role in promoting replication through oxaliplatin, satra-platin, and picoplatin adducts. REV 1 and Pol were necessary for tolerance to all four platinum analogs and prevention of hyperactivation of the DNA damage response after treatment. In addition, REV 1 and Pol were important for the resolution of DNA double-stranded breaks created during replication-asso-ciated repair of platinum-containing ICLs. Consistent with ICLs being the predominant cytotoxic lesion, depletion of REV 1 or Pol rendered two different model cell systems extremely sen-sitive to all four drugs, whereas Pol depletion had little effect. Together, our data suggest that REV 1 and Pol are critical for promoting resistance to all four clinically relevant platinum-based drugs by promoting both translesion DNA synthesis and DNA repair...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Metallopharmaceuticals play an {{important}} role in contemporary society as therapeutic and diagnostic agents. Many metallopharmaceuticals have been developed to treat/cure a variety of cancers. Besides platinum compounds- cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, tetraplatin, <b>satraplatin</b> etc., non-platinum compounds viz. NAMI-A, KP 1019, KP 46, auranofin and As 2 O 3 etc. have shown promising results and many of them are in different phases of clinical trials. Traces of metals are essential for the proper functioning of enzymes in our body and also for the activity of many drugs of organic nature. Chelation in many cases causes drastic change in biological properties of ligands as well as metal moiety. Metal complexes are supposed to exert their effect by intercalation/cleavage of DNA/RNA, arrest of cell cycle and alteration of cell membrane functions. Recently, different strategies to overcome resistance against metal-based anticancer drugs and targeted drug delivery to cancerous cells have been described. These include the encapsulation, conjugation and prodrug formation with different polymer/macromolecules. The review includes the recent developments in anticancer metallopharmaceuticals being developed as therapeutic agents during the recent past...|$|E
40|$|Hypoxia {{in solid}} tumors remains a {{challenge}} for conventional cancer therapeutics. As a source for resistance, metastasis development and drug bioprocessing, it influences treatment results and disease outcome. Bioreductive platinum(IV) prodrugs might be advantageous over conventional metal-based therapeutics, as biotransformation in a reductive milieu, such as under hypoxia, is required for drug activation. This study deals with a two-step screening of experimental platinum(IV) prodrugs with different rates of reduction and lipophilicity {{with the aim of}} identifying the most appropriate compounds for further investigations. In the first step, the cytotoxicity of all compounds was compared in hypoxic multicellular spheroids and monolayer culture using a set of cancer cell lines with different sensitivities to platinum(II) compounds.

40|$|Recurrent {{prostate}} cancer (PCa) remains a major clinical challenge.

40|$|Methods of {{computational}} chemistry {{represent an}} important tool in development of novel materials or drugs. In this thesis, they are used for investigation of Pt anticancer drugs. Interaction of five hydrated Pt(II) complexes with guanine as a small model of DNA is studied at the DFT level. Several Pt(IV) complexes exhibit less side effects and overcome some resistances of cisplatin, nevertheless they must be reduced to their Pt(II) analogues to obtain anticancer activity due to their high kinetic inertness. Therefore, reduction potentials for eleven Pt(IV) complexes are determined using DFT and post-Hartree-Fock methods. The kinetics of reduction play more important role. Thus, we study reaction mechanisms for reduction of tetraplatin by deoxyguanosine monophosphate and <b>satraplatin</b> by ascorbic acid.

40|$|In {{attempts}} {{to develop an}} orally applicable platinum-based drug, platinum(IV) drugs which exhibit higher in vivo stability compared to the platinum(II) drug cisplatin were formulated. The first such chemotherapeutic agent, namely <b>satraplatin,</b> failed to receive approval. In the present work, we checked the initial cellular stress response of the chemosensitive NCI-H 526 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells by determination of the relative phosphorylation of 46 specific phosphorylation sites of 38 selected proteins in a six hours response to cisplatin (platinum(II)) or oxoplatin (platinum(IV)), respectively. Oxoplatin is considered as prodrug of cisplatin, although several findings point to differences in intracellular effects. Cisplatin induced hyperphosphorylation of p 38 α MAPK and AMPKα 1, whereas oxoplatin treatment resulted in increased phosphorylation {{of a large number}} of signaling proteins involved in stress response/drug resistance, including JNK, GSK- 3 α, AMPKα 1, src kinases, STATs, CHK- 2 and especially focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Cisplatin exerts markedly higher cytotoxicity upon four hours short-term exposure in comparison to oxoplatin and, correspondingly, the extended initial stress response to the platinum(IV) drug oxoplatin thus is expected to increase clinical drug resistance. Induction of a substantial stress response to any prodrug of a platinum-based compound may likewise limit the effectivity of its active metabolite(s), such contributing to the failure of selected derivatized platinum complexes...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of cisplatin {{more than two}} decades ago was the most important therapeutic advance in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Today, cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with paclitaxel is the most commonly used first-line treatment for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Although platinum drugs remain a critical component of chemotherapy in this type of cancer, cumulative toxicities can limit their use. These toxicities include nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity and ototoxicity with cisplatin and myelosuppression with carboplatin. Although these adverse events can often be managed, the interventions themselves can complicate and add to the costs of treatment. Importantly, acquired resistance to traditional platinum drugs often develops in patients with ovarian cancer and can limit the usefulness of these drugs. Research into new platinum drugs has focused on identifying compounds with improved tolerability profiles and, importantly, those which can circumvent mechanisms of platinum resistance. New platinum drugs currently under development that are showing promise in ovarian cancer include oxaliplatin, nedaplatin, <b>satraplatin,</b> BBR 3464 and ZD 0473. If the encouraging in vitro activity shown by new compounds, such as ZD 0473 and BBR 3464, translates into efficacy in the clinic, they may offer an extended spectrum of activity which includes patients with ovarian cancer resistant to the classical platinum drugs.

Unfortunately its continued use is greatly limited by severe dose limiting side effects and intrinsic or acquired drug resistance. Over the last 30 years, 23 other platinum-based drugs have entered clinical trials with only two (carboplatin and oxaliplatin) of these gaining international marketing approval, and another three (nedaplatin, lobaplatin and heptaplatin) gaining approval in individual nations.

40|$|Abstract Background. The broad {{spectrum}} of antitumor activity of both the oral platinum analogue <b>satraplatin</b> (S) and capecitabine (C), along with the advantage of their oral administration, prompted a clinical study aimed to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination. Patients and methods. Four dose levels of S (mg/m(2) /day) and C (mg/m(2) /day) were evaluated in adult patients with advanced solid tumors: 60 / 1650, 80 / 1650, 60 / 2000, 70 / 2000; a course consisted of 28 days with sequential administration of S (days 1 - 5) and C (days 8 - 21) followed by one week rest. Results. Thirty-seven patients were treated, 24 in the dose escalation and 13 in the expansion phase; at the MTD, defined at S 70 /C 2000, two patients presented dose limiting toxicities: lack of recovery of neutropenia by day 42 and nausea with dose skip of C. Most frequent toxicities were nausea (57 %), diarrhea (51 %), neutropenia (46 %), anorexia, fatigue, vomiting (38 % each). Two partial responses were observed in platinum sensitive ovarian cancer and one in prostate cancer. Conclusion. At S 70 /C 2000 the combination of sequential S and C is tolerated with manageable toxicities; its evaluation in platinum and fluorouracil sensitive tumor types is worthwhile because of the easier administration and lack of nephro- and neurotoxicity as compared to parent compounds...|$|E

Despite having a {{favorable}} prognosis, the incidence of incurable metastatic disease and mortality in the US is about 28, 000 per year. Although hormone-based androgen deprivation therapies typically result in rapid responses, nearly all patients eventually develop progressive castration-resistant disease state. With readily available prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, most of these patients are asymptomatic and manifest progression simply as a rising PSA. In patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the median survival is about 1 &ndash; 2 years, with improvements in survival seen mostly with docetaxel-based regimens. The purpose of this article is to review the recent developments in the treatment of advanced CRPC. Recent findings: Since the two landmark trials (TAX- 327 and Southwest Oncology Group 99 &ndash; 16) in CRPC, several newer cytotoxic drugs (epothilones, <b>satraplatin),</b> targeted agents (abiraterone, MDV 3100) and vaccines have been tested in phase II and III setting with promising results. Conclusions: The role of newer agents in the treatment of CRPC still needs to be validated by phase III trials, which are currently ongoing. Whilst the novel biomarkers, &lsquo;circulating tumor cells&rsquo;, have been shown to provide important prognostic information and are anticipated to be incorporated in future clinical decision-making, their exact utility and relevance calls for a larger prospective validation.

40|$|Metastatic {{breast cancer}} is an incurable disease, often {{characterized}} by poor response to standard chemotherapy, which is mainly based on anthracyclines and taxanes. Thus, increasing tumor cell sensitivity to these agents is an attractive goal towards improving the clinical management of this disease. The present study investigates the effects of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat 3) inhibition on {{the response of the}} highly metastatic MDA-MB- 231 human breast adenocarcinoma cell line to doxorubicin (DOX). Stat 3 is a transcription factor often constitutively activated in breast tumors and cancer cell lines, and is thought to contribute to malignant transformation and progression by transactivation of a host of target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival, angiogenesis and invasiveness. Our results indicate that (a) untreated MDA-MB- 231 cells express higher baseline levels of (activated) pTyr(705) Stat 3, that are further upregulated following exposure to DOX, than the non-metastatic MCF- 7 cell line; (b) inhibiting the Stat 3 signaling pathway, by exposure to the tyrphostin AG 490 (an inhibitor of the upstream activating Janus kinases), by transfection with a dominant-negative form of Stat 3 or by treatment with <b>satraplatin</b> (a tetravalent platinum derivative that inhibits Stat 3 activation), increases breast cancer cell response to the proapoptotic effect of DOX (to different extents). In addition, the latter two approaches have been shown to interfere with expression of one or more antiapoptotic proteins. Overall, these observations suggest that suppression of Stat 3 signaling may provide a potential therapeutic approach to overcoming DOX resistance in metastatic breast cancer cells...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{discovery}} of its potent antitumoral activity in 1965, the inorganic drug cisplatin {{has become one of}} the most important anticancer agents in clinical use. 1 It exhibits exceptional activity against germ-cell testicular cancer, for which it is the first-line therapeutic option. 2 Its success led to the development of second-generation drugs, namely carboplatin and oxaliplatin, both of which are also based on the cis-diam(m) ineplatinum(II) pharmacophore. Together, these FDA-approved PtII drugs constitute some of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents (Figure  1). 3 Yet, despite their clinical success, the use of PtII drugs is limited by their high toxicity, severe side-effects, and incidences of drug resistance. 4 To address some of these limitations, researchers have developed stable PtIV carboxylate complexes as anticancer prodrugs that can be activated by intracellular reduction to release their latent cytotoxic activity. 5 This versatile strategy has been used to develop PtIV prodrug complexes with highly tuned properties, 6 which are capable of targeting, 7 as well as delivering novel modes of action. 8 The most prominent example is <b>satraplatin,</b> which is currently undergoing Phase III clinical trials against hormone-refractory prostate cancer (Figure  1). 9 Although there is much interest in understanding and exploiting this prodrug strategy as a springboard towards the next generation of Pt drugs, tools capable of directly visualizing the uptake and accumulation of these clinically important compounds are lacking. Herein, we describe a fluorescent probe that was custom-built for the detection of PtII drugs such as cisplatin. Using confocal microscopy, we could determine the localization of the PtIV prodrugs in cancer cells in vitro after cell entry and intracellular reduction...|$|E
