Soil is slowly {{renewable}} resource and once lost, gives {{a field that}} will not be as productive for many years. Over time, even small soil losses accumulate to reduced returns. The results obtained by rain simulation tests show that there are relationships between the solid filler (C) and runoff (Kr) especially when the soil is dry. All the results obtained have shown that the intensity of runoff and erosion is c losely related to the surface states, they even related to land use, slope and rainfall. The interaction of all these parameters is the origin of the genesis of runoff inducing soil loss. In parallel to these factors studied, other factors seem to increase the soil's susceptibility to erosion in the area Zariffet: increasingly extended water deficit, management practices that no longer follow bioclimatic changing environment and especially natural fire frequency. The simulation method, very useful approach, enabled to have significant results on the behavior of the soil and the factors involved on <b>short</b> <b>notic...</b>|$|E
