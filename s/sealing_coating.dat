40|$|Summary. Goal. To {{investigate}} the phase {{composition of the}} obtained sealing coatings based on aluminophosphate compound (APC) {{and the impact of}} temperature rise on it. Methods. Qualitative X-ray phase analysis (XRPA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) are used as the methods of research. Roentgenograms for structural analysis were obtained on a DRON- 4 - 07 using filtered copper radiation in the secondary beam. Registration and initial processing of diffraction patterns was performed using the software package PDOS with the output of the diffraction patterns on the screen. Using the "loupe" option allowed to identify weak interference lines, which increased the accuracy of the method of qualitative XRPA. The thermograms for DTA received on the device type Termoskan- 2. The results. It is revealed that base of coating is X-ray amorphous phase. There are following crystalline phases: Al, AlPO 4, Al (PO 3) 3, BN found in the coating. It is revealed that annealing doesn’t make a significant influence on the phase composition of the crystalline phases and the coating doesn’t lose properties after annealing during repeated thermal stress. Scientific novelty. The phase composition of the proposed sealing coatings based on APC and produced by plasma spraying, and the effect of annealing on the phase composition of the coating are investigated. The reaction of synthesis of primary material forming on the basis of APC for coating is offered. Practical significance. The results can be used in aviation technology in the development of gas turbine engines (GTE) and the design of the compressors. The <b>sealing</b> <b>coating</b> may be used to improve the reliability of the compressor and to increase the efficiency ratio of turbine engine. During the operation the compressor’s blades touch the <b>sealing</b> <b>coating</b> of compressor’s stator and grooves it without causing locking and destruction of the rotor. Therefore, the development of new <b>sealing</b> <b>coating</b> compositions that provide reliable operation of the GTE compressor, and determination of their properties and structure, are very important...|$|E

40|$|The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) spends over $ 250 {{million per}} year to {{maintain}} almost 200, 000 miles of roadway with more than 450 million vehicle miles per day. <b>Seal</b> <b>coats</b> are {{very important for the}} Department’s preventive maintenance program. <b>Seal</b> <b>coats</b> {{are one of the most}} important elements of pavement maintenance because they slow down pavement deterioration. It is less expensive to <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> roads with low traffic volumes every few years than it is to overlay or completely replace the road. <b>Seal</b> <b>coats</b> also beautify and seal the road from water.

40|$|This project {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> materials and design method. The primary objectives of this research are 1) to evaluate <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> performance from various combinations of aggregates and emulsions in terms of aggregate loss; 2) to evaluate how the properties of aggregates and emulsions affect <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> performance; 3) to evaluate current <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> design methods based on INDOT <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> practice; and 4) to develop <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> design software incorporating Indiana practice. To evaluate the effects of aggregate and emulsion types on aggregate loss performance of <b>seal</b> <b>coat,</b> three emulsions and eight aggregates including CRS- 2 P, RS- 2 P, and AE- 90 S for emulsions and Trap Rock, Sandstone, Blast Furnace Slag, Steel Slag, Limestone, Dolomite, Crushed Gravel (one face), and Crushed Gravel (two faces) were tested utilizing the sweep test and Vialit test. In addition, to explore influential factors (i. e., electrical surface charge interaction, water evaporation change in emulsion, water affinity of aggregate, etc.), the Zeta potential, water content, and X-ray deflection (XRD) tests were also conducted. According to the Zeta potential test results, the electrical surface charge of an aggregate in emulsions varies {{with the type of}} emulsion (i. e., with the pH of the emulsifier). From the water content test, among the emulsions, CRS- 2 P was the earliest emulsion to have enough bond strength to retain aggregates in open traffic. In addition, aggregate can retard the water evaporation process of emulsions. Based on the XRD test results, Sandstone and Dolomite have the highest and smallest content of SiO 2, respectively among the eight aggregates. This means that Sandstone and Limestone have the highest and lowest water affinity (hydrophilic and hydrophobic), respectively. In the sweep test with Limestone with various curing time, CRS- 2 P showed superior aggregate loss performance among the emulsions. Comparing the sweep test results to the water contents of emulsions, faster water evaporation presented better aggregate loss performance. This finding indicates that the bond strength of emulsion to retain aggregate can be mainly a function of water evaporation in emulsion. Based on the sweep test at 77 ˚F after 24 hours of curing, CRS- 2 P performed the best regardless of aggregate type. The Vialit test at a temperature range of 35 °F to - 22 F° after 24 hours of curing shows the most aggregate loss at lower testing temperatures. AE- 90 S had the strongest resistance in losing aggregate among the three emulsions at lower temperatures, which is an opposite trend comparing to the sweep test results. Also, Crushed Gravel with two faces outperformed Crushed Gravbel with one face. According to statistical analysis results, it was concluded that AE- 90 S and Crushed Gravel with two faces showed the best performance among the emulsions and aggregates, respectively. In addition the best-performing aggregate-emulsion combinations were AE- 90 S with most of the aggregates, except for Steel Slag. Thus, the aggregate type in terms of mineral/chemical composition is not a major factor affecting the aggregate loss performance. To develop a <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> design, <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> performance was evaluated for various emulsion (EAR) and aggregate application rates (AAR) by using three different evaluation methods: the IRI, friction, and visual inspection. Based on these performance tests, immediate failure occurring locally during construction due to incorrect application rate (e. g., insufficient aggregate rate) can cause total failure of the <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> road resulting from a chain reaction. Employing a factor to compensate for AAR discrepancies between target and actual is critical for <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> survival during construction. This study confirms the irrelevance of <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> application to IRI values due to the thin coat and the limitation of the IRI measurement (e. g., 250 mm moving average). The friction test results show an adequate skid resistance performance on all <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> test sections. In addition, friction improvements due to <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> applications were confirmed within a range of <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> rates applied in this study. Overall, IRI, friction, and visual inspection did not show distinct differences in <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> performance in terms of application rates. A methodology in selecting an equipment factor for correcting any difference between a target rate and a measured rate was developed considering reliability and a designed rate using the McLeod equation. Design software, “INDOT <b>SEAL</b> <b>COAT</b> DESIGN (iSeal) ”, was developed as part of the study to aid the <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> design process and incorporates INDOT <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> practice. The software was largely based on the McLeod design method which includes factors that the INDOT <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> specification lacks. Furthermore, an additional factor, an equipment factor, was implemented into the design process to resolve issues due to discrepancies between designed rate and applied rate...|$|R

Aggregates were chosen from across the State to represent the various types normally encountered and were used with {{two different types of}} binder bitumens. A water spray treatment was also included to simulate the effects of rainfall. The evaluation was based upon aggregate retention.

The results were subjected to engineering judgement in order to verify if the conclusions are justifiable or not. General linear regression models were then used to quantify the impacts. The second issue was evaluated by using a life cycle costing approach. The costs included in the evaluation covered annual routine maintenance costs, <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> costs, and resurfacing costs at the end of lifecycle. The third issue was dealt with utilizing a number of techniques: an expert opinion survey, a comparative evaluation of practices in other jurisdictions, and telephone interviews and focused group discussions. ^ Testing of significance yielded three groups of findings: the first group contained activities that demonstrated a 2 ̆ 2 definitely significant 2 ̆ 2 impact on either roughness measurements, pavement serviceability ratings, or both; the second group, activities that demonstrated a 2 ̆ 2 marginally significant 2 ̆ 2 impact on the condition indicators listed above; and the third, activities that could not be confirmed either way. ^ Life cycle costing illustrated that <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> is more of a stop-gap measure allowing greater flexibility in capital spending than a cost-effective solution to problems. ^ The developed policy guidelines included a general statement on when and where <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> should be applied; a set of principles that defined which types of roads should receive priority; and a decision tree to assist in making decisions on specific projects. ^ The study recommended a three finger strategy for the improved definition of the effectiveness of maintenance activities.
