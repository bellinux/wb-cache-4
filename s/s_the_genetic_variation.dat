Comparative genome sequencing of 3 S. aureus isolates obtained sequentially over 26 months from the airways of a cystic fibrosis patient, revealed variation in phage content, and genetic polymorphisms in genes which influence antibiotic resistance, and global regulation of virulence. The majority of polymorphisms were isolate-specific suggesting {{the existence of an}} heterogeneous infecting population that evolved from a single infecting strain of <b>S.</b> aureus. <b>The</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> identified correlated with differences in growth rate, hemolytic activity, and antibiotic sensitivity, implying a profound effect on <b>the</b> ecology of <b>S.</b> aureus. In particular, a high frequency of mutations in loci associated with the alternate transcription factor SigB, were observed.

We pose that <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> is exogenous; in other words, <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> in a study population is not caused by disease or brain anatomy.

Large-scale imaging initiatives, such as ADNI, offer a possibility to study this shrinkage of brain regions. This can be estimated from MRI data of diseased individuals and controls, and expressed in cortical thickness and subcortical volume measurements.|$|R

We review and compare three whole-genome analysis methods that use mixed linear models (MLMs) to estimate <b>genetic</b> <b>variation.</b> In all methods, <b>genetic</b> <b>variation</b> is estimated from the relationship between close or distant relatives on the basis of pedigree information and/or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
