The second chapter studies the legislative requirements of the reporting of crimes in the Czech Republic, which is mostly regulated in the Criminal Procedure Code.

5000|$|Following the <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> a <b>complaint</b> {{the author}} will be advised {{if it has}} been {{registered}} and the complaint will also {{be sent to the}} State concerned for comment. Article Four of the First Optional Protocol provides that the State will have six months to submit comments on the complaint. Once the Committee has received the comments from the State these comments will be provided to the author who can then issue a response (generally within two months). Following the comments there is generally a two-stage process comprising the [...] "Admissibility" [...] stage and the [...] "Merits" [...] stage, however, due to the immense workload that the United Nations Human Rights Committee has, these two stages are usually undertaken simultaneously. The Committee assesses complaints on a closed basis in accordance with Article Five of the First Optional Protocol and for that reason only the original written complaint, the response from the State and the reply by the author will be considered. The Committee does not take any further action to verify the information that has been provided and the author or representatives of the State cannot take part via phone or video connection. If there is the potential for a substantial harm to occur that is permanent in nature, such as the execution of a death penalty or the deportation of a person who could face torture, then the author <b>of</b> the <b>complaint</b> can request that it be greeted with Urgency. Cases such as these are covered by Rule 86 of the Committee's Rules of Procedure. Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur on New Communications can issue 'interim measures' in order to prevent the harm occurring while the complaint is being considered. The Committee views any failure by the State to adhere by these interim measures a breach of their obligations under the First Optional Protocol.|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the role the African and Inter-American human rights systems in {{protecting}} the rights of detainees through interim measures. The need for regional human rights to complement protection {{at the national level}} is all the more pronounced when it comes to detainees, because they oft en lack democratic leverage at the national level. While complementing the universal system, regional systems have the added benefit of closer connection and binding judgments. Because the situation of detainees often requires urgent intervention, interim measures are required to ensure that detainees do not suffer undue harm. A comparative survey of interim measures in the two regional systems reveals that, while these measures had been issued in both systems, the Inter-American has used them much more frequently. One of the reasons for this difference {{is the fact that the}} Inter-American system does not make the <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> a formal <b>complaint</b> a prerequisite for issuing interim measures. The African Commission should amend its Rules of Procedure to allow for a similar possibility; and it should devote more resources and institutionalize this procedure. Despite the inclusion of collective rights in the African system, the African Commission has infrequently dealt with urgent measures affecting groups of detainees. Both systems suffer from some defects. There is a lack of substantiated reasoning in decisions dealing with interim measures, especially when requests are rejected; information is not made available systematically about the fate of all requests for interim measures; and a lack of compliance besets both systems.

40|$|The United Nations General Assembly in 2006 {{adopted the}} Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), {{sparking}} debate in Africa about the desirability and feasibility of adopting an African pendant to this UN treaty. Two main rationales that support an 'African' treaty {{on the rights}} of persons with disabilities (PWDs) are examined in this article. The first is a process argument that contends that African participation in the elaboration of the CRPD was inadequate. The second, substantive argument suggests that the CRPD, itself, is defective, as it does not adequately address issues pertinent to and reflecting the life world of Africans with disabilities. Concluding that both rationales lack persuasive force, the authors identify two alternative courses of action. First, they argue that the CRPD should be prioritised and used to its fullest extent before attempts are made to elaborate parallel African standards to the CRPD. Among the measures to be prioritised are increased ratification, domestication, presentation of state and alternative civil society reports, and <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>complaints.</b> Second, given that all African Union (AU) member states (except South Sudan) are party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, they contend that the existing mechanisms under the African human rights system should first be fully exploited. Although the African human rights system may not have delivered sufficient results when it comes to PWDs, it has taken some tentative steps and has further unexplored potential. There is both a need and the potential for the regional system to play its part in advancing the rights of PWDs. In particular, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights could draw inspiration from the recent adoption of its first General Comment (on art 14 (1) (d) and (e) of the Women's Protocol) to spell out the implications of the African Charter for PWDs. Formulating a new treaty is a complex and time-consuming exercise that will further delay the effective implementation of states' obligations. However, if the option of an African-specific treaty gains wide support, it should {{take the form of a}} protocol to the African Charter, with the African Commission as monitoring mechanism, and not as a separate treaty with a self-standing treaty monitoring body.

40|$|Kenya’s arid and {{semi-arid}} regions {{have faced}} recurrent drought, famine, and inter-community conflicts. High levels of need {{have led to}} large humanitarian relief programmes involving government and national and international nongovernmental organisations (NGOs). This is {{the context in which}} Transparency International Kenya (TI-Kenya) ’s Uwajibikaji Pamoja (Accountability Together) programme emerged. Uwajibikaji Pamoja is an integrated complaints referral mechanism run by TI-Kenya in partnership with more than 40 service providers, including government and development aid agencies. The system allows citizens to lodge complaints about gaps in access to a range of services provided by the government and humanitarian agencies, through a toll-free SMS line, email and walk-ins, from where the complaint is then referred to the relevant provider. The system then follows up with complainants and provides information on the status of their feedback. It is designed to complement internal feedback mechanisms set up by partners, where these exist, by making <b>submission</b> and receipt <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> easier, less costly and less time-consuming. This paper summarises the process and findings of practitioner research to assess the effectiveness of Uwajibikaji Pamoja and how technology has facilitated the system. These findings indicate that the wide range of government and NGO bodies involved in Uwajibikaji Pamoja have made significant changes to their processes for dealing with and responding to complaints {{as a result of the}} TI-Kenya report’s recommendations. Ensuring responsiveness requires building trust and commitment among beneficiary communities, but it also requires service providers to understand how citizens’ feedback can benefit service delivery and management.
