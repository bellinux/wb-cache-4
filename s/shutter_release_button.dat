2500|$|During 1967 through 1969 KMZ {{built an}} {{automatic}} die-cast moulding line, allowing mass camera production. Camera production {{switched to the}} M42×1 thread (also known as Praktica thread) and an instant-return mirror was also developed. This led {{to one of the}} most famous Zenits — Zenit-E which saw (including its subtypes) over 12 million produced. A heavy and tough camera with a mechanism that was of exceedingly simple design along the lines of [...] "what isn't there, can't go wrong". [...] Automatic diaphragm functionality was not available until the introduction of the Zenit-EM, which used a direct mechanism linking the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button</b> to the aperture mechanism, significantly increasing the effort required to release the shutter. [...] Production included both M39×1 and M42×1 mounts for the Zenit E and Zenit B models. [...] Later models were only produced in the M42×1 with the Pentax K mount available for the latest models.|$|E
5000|$|The {{exposure}} meter's {{mechanical arm}} is retracted by depressing the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button.</b> As a result, the exposure meter will {{not produce a}} usable reading if the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button</b> is under any pressure.|$|E
50|$|AI Servo AF {{was used}} for moving objects. The lens would {{continuously}} refocus on the object in {{the centre of the}} viewfinder whilst the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button</b> was pressed half-way. Once the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button</b> was fully pressed, the exposure was calculated then the shutter released.|$|E
50|$|The only {{accessory}} {{specific to}} the EOS 100 made by Canon was the GR-70 grip extension. However, unlike other grip extensions, this provide neither further power solutions (e.g. via AA batteries), nor extra <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>buttons</b> (e.g. for shooting in vertical, portrait orientation).|$|R
50|$|Every lens {{has its own}} Seikosha (chrome) or Seiko (black) leaf shutter {{system with}} a shutter speed of B, 1' -1/500 sec, X or M flash {{synchronisation}} and bulb mode.The C330 camera has two <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>buttons,</b> an automatic conversion film counter 120/220, {{an indicator of the}} film in use, a removable back cover, a hexagonal distance scale rod for the different lenses, automatic parallax compensation, an automatic exposure factor indicator and interchangeable focusing screens.|$|R
50|$|The MB-D10 is an {{optional}} accessory battery pack {{that provides a}} vertical grip as well as additional <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> and autofocus <b>buttons,</b> command dials and focus point selection control.|$|R
5000|$|Focus lock: Focus {{is locked}} by {{pressing}} AE/AF-L button or lightly pressing <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button</b> in Single Servo AF ...|$|E
5000|$|Shutter release modes (and film advance) are {{controlled}} by a 4-position switch surrounding the top-mounted <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button.</b> Positions are: ...|$|E
50|$|Using the Drive Button, the {{photographer}} could choose whether to allow single or multiple photographs {{to be taken}} as the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button</b> was held.|$|E
5000|$|In photography, the shutter-release <b>button</b> (sometimes just <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> or <b>shutter</b> <b>button)</b> is a {{push-button}} {{found on}} many cameras, {{used to take}} a picture. When pressed, the shutter of the camera is [...] "released", so that it opens to capture a picture, and then closes, allowing an exposure time {{as determined by the}} shutter speed setting (which may be automatic). Some cameras also utilize an electronic shutter, as opposed to a mechanical shutter.|$|R
50|$|The <b>release</b> <b>button</b> {{was placed}} in an {{uncommon}} spot, halfway {{down the front of}} the camera. If the user used the middle finger for the <b>shutter</b> <b>release,</b> it was possible to have an unusually solid grip on the housing.|$|R
5000|$|The camera's {{top plate}} has the {{manually}} set frame counter, the <b>shutter</b> <b>release,</b> the {{film rewind knob}} with film reminder dial, the exposure needle window, meter adjustment knob with EV and ASA/DIN scales, the film (advance) <b>release</b> <b>button,</b> the frame (counter) advance slider, and the accessory shoe. The bottom plate contains the tripod socket, the film advance lever, the back release latch, and the film rewind <b>release</b> <b>button.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Slider {{protecting}} {{camera lens}} removed {{to make room}} for the larger battery; the camera application is now started by holding down the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Shutter {{release is}} {{activated}} by pressing the top-mounted <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button</b> or by a cable release inserted {{in a standard}} socket located {{on the side of}} the camera.|$|E
50|$|The cloth {{focal-plane shutter}} {{provides}} speeds from 1/30 to 1/1000 sec. and B. The <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button</b> is {{situated on the}} right-hand camera front externally threaded for Leica cable release. The shutter control is the small milled knob on the top with numerals from 30 to 1000 and B engraved around it. It serves dual purposes, for winding the shutter in a single anti-clockwise motion until a catch arrests it, and thence as a lift and turn type shutter speed selector. A standard coaxial flash synchronising socket is situated {{at the front of}} the camera, below the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E
50|$|Prominently {{placed at}} the top are the large wind-on and rewind knobs, the {{right-hand}} one is the film advance knob, both to be operated in the clockwise direction. Next to it is a manually reset automatic frame counter dial and the chromed wind-on <b>release</b> <b>button,</b> the latter not to be mistaken for the <b>shutter</b> <b>release.</b> The front element focusing Kodak lens has a rigid lensmount set in a Kodak inter-lens shutter. The shutter is cocked by a gear coupling to the sprocket-wheel drum, which is trailing along with the passing film during the wind-on operation. Hence, there is no shutter cocking without a film in the camera. An automatic mechanism locates the next frame on the film by locking the advance knob. It is released for the next frame by depressing the wind-on <b>release</b> <b>button</b> before turning the wind-on knob. This prevents double exposure, but not blank frames since nothing prevents pressing the button again and advance the film. However, a red indicator is shown to the left in a slot {{on the top of}} the shutter cover that indicates the camera has been wound. The <b>shutter</b> <b>release,</b> in the shape of a rearward-pointing pin attached to the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> lever, is situated at about 10-o'clock at the shutter housing. It is protected from being accidentally triggered by a small cover extending over it.|$|R
50|$|The Topcon RE Super, or Beseler Topcon Super D in USA, was {{launched}} by Tokyo Kogaku KK in 1963 and manufactured until 1971, {{at which point}} it was upgraded to the Super D and again to Super DM the following year. General sale continued for several years. These later models have a <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> lock lever on the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> collar. It is a professional oriented 35mm SLR camera that had a comprehensive range of accessories available. It has a removable pentaprism viewfinder and focusing screen. It features the Exakta bayonet lens mount for interchangeable lenses. A special accessory shoe is situated {{at the base of}} the rewind knob with a standard PC sync. contact next to it. The <b>release</b> <b>button</b> is placed at the right-hand camera front, but it lacks a mirror-up facility. This was included on the upgraded versions. The standard lens is the RE. Auto-Topcor 1:1.4 f=5.8cm or the slightly slower 1:1.8 version. A battery-operated winder to be attached to the camera base was made available.|$|R
50|$|Headphones {{can be used}} as a <b>shutter</b> <b>release.</b> The + (volume up) button acts as a <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> for the camera.|$|R
5000|$|When set to bulb, {{generally}} on the [...] "M" [...] or manual {{setting of}} the camera, the shutter will stay open {{as long as the}} <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button</b> (or shutter release cable or remote) remains depressed.|$|E
5000|$|Lastly, the 9xi {{lacked a}} real {{vertical}} grip, only having a [...] "battery grip" [...] extending the handgrip slightly while adding support for AA batteries. This grip completely lacked controls of any kind, even a <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A battery {{checking}} feature uses a LED {{inside the}} viewfinder; {{if there is}} sufficient power this illuminates whenever the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button</b> is lightly depressed. Another viewfinder LED illuminates whenever the camera's chosen shutter speed is below [...] s.|$|E
50|$|The Canonflex was {{inspired}} to an extent by the company's rangefinder camera models. It has a thumb-operated wind-on lever on the camera's base and a removable meterless finder prism, which slides off after depressing {{a button on the}} left hand camera front. The rewind release is situated at the base. Long time exposure is accomplished by sliding a switch next to the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> to the left, before or while depressing the <b>release</b> <b>button.</b> It must be returned to terminate the exposure. At the right-hand camera front is a wide accessory shoe taking a selenium exposure meter, which couples to the shutter speed dial. The camera stayed in production for one year before it was replaced by the Canonflex R2000, adding the 1/2000 sec. shutter speed.|$|R

5000|$|Connected to {{the release}} socket of the camera body, this one-meter long switch lets you release the shutter without {{touching}} the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button,</b> especially useful in preventing camera shake and vibration during extended-time exposures using its lock mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Note that {{exposure}} control was initiated by lightly pressing the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button</b> — separate from AF initiation. This made {{control of the}} ME F a two-step, two-handed operation. Asahi Optical recommended left hand AF first, then right hand metering.|$|E
5000|$|Attached to the SF1's hotshoe, this adapter {{allows you}} to {{position}} an accessory flash like [...] the AF400FTZ away from the camera via the 5P Sync Cord. It also provides an easier access to [...] the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button</b> when using the AF080C Ring Light Set.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> {{cable or}} self timer {{is almost always}} used to prevent camera shake when the <b>shutter</b> is <b>released.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Drive modes include 10-second self-timer, 2-second delay (in {{the absence}} of remote <b>shutter</b> <b>release),</b> first burst, last burst, 3-shot {{exposure}} bracketing, 5-shot exposure bracketing, time lapse. There is no remote <b>shutter</b> <b>release.</b> Exposure bracketing cannot be used with self-timer modes.|$|R

50|$|The movie mode {{is turned}} on by a switch {{on top of the}} camera next to the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button.</b> Movies are {{recorded}} in AVI format (motion JPEG) with monaural sound. Picture quality is good with Fine resolution set as 640×480 at 30 frame/s. Other resolution setting is 320×240 at 30 frame/s for long movie recording.|$|E
5000|$|... “The ease-of-use, {{advanced}} {{features and}} attractive price make the Pentax K100D digital SLR a perfect choice for users moving {{up from a}} point-and-shoot camera", meaning that the new Pentax DSLRs were easy to use, even for a beginner. The K110D and K100D, unlike the K10D, {{do not have the}} typical aperture adjustment wheel found under the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> <b>button</b> on most DSLRs.|$|E
5000|$|The term bulb is a {{reference}} to old-style pneumatically actuated shutters; squeezing an air bulb would open the <b>shutter,</b> and <b>releasing</b> the bulb would close it. According to the Focal Encyclopedia of Photography: BULB EXPOSURE (B). Another term for a brief exposure—in which the shutter remains open only {{so long as the}} <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> is held down. The word originated with the early pneumatic <b>shutter</b> <b>release.</b>|$|R
