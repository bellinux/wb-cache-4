40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the deployment of <b>self-mentions</b> in 18 history and 18 anthropology published research articles. ‘I’ was used more frequently in the anthropology articles than in history articles, a finding that can be traced to the knowledge-making practices of the disciplines. However, considerable intra-disciplinary variation was also observed, both in terms of frequency of <b>self-mentions</b> per article and the author roles adopted via the use of the first-person subject pronoun. Based on the results, I argue that there is a need to raise students' awareness of intra- as well as interdisciplinary variation in academic discourse, particularly in the humanities...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} research articles (RAs) written in English (Eng) and Bahasa Indonesia (BI) by 6 Indonesian scholar writers, each contributing 5 RAs in Eng and 5 RAs in BI. The rhetorical features of these 60 pre-published RAs which represent 6 different disciplines (Ecology, Cultural Studies, Applied Linguistics, Economics, Medicine, and Literature) were examined to reveal metadiscursive interaction using the interpersonal metadiscourse (IMD) taxonomy of Crismore et al. (1993) and <b>self-mentions</b> adapting Hyland’s (2002 c) and Harwood’s (2005) models to find out: if writers differ in their deployment of interpersonal metadiscourse and <b>self-mentions</b> across BI and Eng; if differences of education, disciplines and publication experiences influence authors’ deployment of these elements {{in the writing of}} RAs in BI and Eng; and if their understanding of discourse community and interaction effect their strategies in the writing of RAs in BI and Eng. Using mixed techniques of quantitative and qualitative analysis, the results show that metadiscursive interaction in Eng RAs is significantly different from that of BI RAs with varying patterns across disciplines under study. As regards <b>self-mentions,</b> despite variations in the patterns and frequency of use, the co-text analyses indicate similar discourse functions in that writers project themselves into their discourse to signal their attempt to engage in the unfolding texts and involve the readers into the propositional content of the texts. The findings indicate high levels of contextualisation in writers’ efforts to interact with readers and these appear to place high regard on the values embedded in disciplinary culture which reaffirm a previous finding by Hyland (2004), typifying the dynamic nature and fluidity of the genre of an RA, besides also showing each individual’s writing style. Combined together, IMD and <b>self-mentions</b> revealed that metadiscursive interaction is a matter of degree of intensity and explicitness, {{as a result of the}} inherent disciplinary culture that has sanctioned each discourse community’s members...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} metadiscourse in the persuasive essays of fourth graders from both {{urban and rural}} communities: 224 students in South Korea and 188 in the US. Each student was asked to write a persuasive essay {{in his or her}} native Korean or English in response to a story not previously read or discussed. Analysis with a taxonomy developed by Hyland (2004) indicated significant differences in the metadiscourse by country. In terms of interactive metadiscourse, South Korean students used more sentence-level transitions than U. S. students, who used more frame markers and endophoric markers. With regard to interactional metadiscourse, U. S. students used more hedges, boosters, engagement markers, and <b>self-mentions</b> in their essays. This study also compared the students′ essays by the type of community in which the writers lived. In the US the essays of students in rural communities contained more hedges, whereas those of students in urban areas included significantly more <b>self-mentions.</b> In South Korea, no significant difference was detected in the metadiscourse of students living in rural and urban areas...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the features of}} stance in tweets downloaded from the English Twitter accounts of Boko Haram and Al Shabaab, referred to as ‘radicalist discourse’. Stance, referred to as ‘positioning’ or point of views of tweeters, is {{defined in terms of}} features such as hedges, boosters, attitude markers, <b>self-mention</b> and threats. These express commitment, attitude and judgement of writers on the issues being discussed. Applying mostly qualitative analysis, the study shows that <b>self-mention</b> and attitude markers are the most prevalent features of stance in radicalist discourse. Thus, stance is used to express triumph, satisfaction, anger and hate by the radical groups under study. The various expressions of attitude and <b>self-mention</b> in the data portray positive construction of in-group and negative evaluation of others (i. e. governments and institutions) referred to as infidels and apostates...|$|R
40|$|Thanks to the {{development}} of the concept of metadiscourse, it is now widely acknowledged that academic/scientific writing is not only concerned with communicating purely propositional meanings: what is communicated through academic/scientific communication is seen to be intertwined with the negotiation of social and interpersonal meanings. While a large number of so called metadiscoursal resources contribute to the simultaneous negotiation of propositional and interpersonal meanings, the present study aimed at investigating the functions <b>self-mention</b> forms can fulfill in academic/scientific communication. Two of Stephen Hawking's scientific books were selected as the corpus of the research, and based on Tang and John's (1999) model, the constructed corpus was analyzed in terms of the functions <b>self-mention</b> forms can fulfill in academic/scientific writing. The findings revealed that from among the different roles identified by Tang and John, the representative role constituted the most frequent <b>self-mention</b> function in the corpus. The remarkably heavy presence of representative role in Hawking's scientific prose was interpreted as a further evidence for the claim that scientists are more likely to persuade readers of their ideas if they frame their messages in ways which appeal to appropriate community-recognized relationships...|$|R

40|$|Building on {{previous}} studies that suggest notable differences between levels {{of writing and}} disciplines, this study investigates stance devices across two parameters: disciplinary differences and academic level of the writer. It investigates disciplinary differences in terms of writer-reader interactions {{in the domain of}} academic writing and how disciplinary communities employ stance markers in research articles. This study also examines what strategies student writers and academics employ in terms of identity within their own writing and how these writers convey their ideas and present themselves. Based on a corpus of 39 academic research articles, this comparative study, following Hyland 2 ̆ 7 s (2005 a) framework, explores whether four categories of stance features (hedges, boosters, attitude markers and <b>self-mentions)</b> show any similarities and differences across the disciplines of Civil Engineering and Applied Linguistics and student and expert writing. The results showed that student writing featured more stance markers than those written by academics, although the differences were small. Moreover, the results revealed cross-disciplinary differences in terms of the frequency of stance markers. The Applied Linguistics research articles contained more stance markers than those in Civil Engineering with a large discrepancy particularly in the use of <b>self-mentions.</b> Findings from this research may help inform student writers and writing instructors about the use of stance markers in academic research articles and help particularly students promote their way of presenting their opinions and themselves in the text...|$|E

Studies on this rhetorical strategy in Arabic academic texts or in those written by Arabic-speaking writers are limited. This study fills this gap by examining 44 paired abstracts (Arabic and English) published in English research articles by Arab scholars. Using Hyland’s (2005) model, the findings indicate the overuse of interactive markers compared to the interactional ones in both sets of abstracts. Within the interactive category, Arabic abstracts relied on transition markers while their English counterparts relied on frame markers and code-glosses. Regarding the interactional category, the English texts employed them more with exception to <b>self-mentions</b> as they were given similar attention in both language groups...|$|E

The study seeks to find patterns governing the use of <b>self-mention</b> devices among native Chinese writers, and to explain such patterns {{in terms of the}} Chinese perception of self. Based on a corpus-based investigation of pronominal and depersonalized forms of <b>self-mention</b> involving 180 research articles, the paper suggests that Chinese authors have a stronger tendency to use depersonalized forms than pronominal forms. It is also found that in using first-person pronouns, Chinese authors in single-authored papers have a salient preference for the plural form, in particular the inclusive plural pronoun. The paper attempts to link the linguistic phenomenon to the concept of the ‘interdependent self’ inherent in Chinese social psychology and proposes possible applications to research in bilingual scholarly writing and academic translation...|$|R

40|$|Author self-citation {{has long}} been of {{interest}} to those working in informetrics for what it reveals about the publishing behavior of individuals and their relationships within academic networks. While this research has produced interesting insights, it typically assumes either that self-citation is a neutral form of reporting not unlike references to others' work or an unsavory kind of academic egotism. By examining self-citation in a wider context of <b>self-mention,</b> however, the phenomenon {{can be seen as}} part of a more comprehensive rhetorical strategy for emphasizing a writer's personal contribution to a piece of research and strengthening his or her knowledge claims, research credibility, and wider standing in the discipline. These meanings are not easily revealed through quantitative bibliometric methods and require careful text analyses and discourse-based interviews with academics. In this paper I explore the use of self-citation and authorial mention in a corpus of 240 research articles and 800 abstracts in eight disciplines. Through an analysis of these texts and interviews with expert informants I show how <b>self-mention</b> is used and the ways these uses reflect both the promotional strategies of individuals and the epistemological practices of their disciplines. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The corpora in the present study comprise a total of 52 thesis abstracts written in English from the department of English Language Teaching, 26 thesis from USA students and 26 from Turkish students. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were employed to analyse the texts in the corpora. The analysis revealed that there were some cultural differences in the amounts and types of metadiscourse. The incidence of evidential, endophorics, code glosses, boosters, attitude markers, <b>self-mentions</b> were fewer in Turkish students’ master thesis abstracts.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{quantitative}} and functional corpus-based study of self-mention in soft science Master theses. One important {{purpose of this study}} was to find out the functions of self-mention in soft science Master theses. For this purpose, 20 soft science Master theses in four disciplines (Applied linguistics, Psychology, Geography, and Political sciences), were randomly selected out of the library of four American universities. Five Master theses were selected in each discipline, in a period of seven years (2007 - 2014). The present study analyzed only  the discussion section of these Master theses. The quantitative analysis of the corpus showed that the frequency of the various forms of self-mention in soft science Master theses is quite different. Among the analyzed resources, “I” with the frequency of 49 was the most frequently used first person pronouns. Based on Tang and John’s (1999) taxonomy of the discourse roles of personal pronouns, self- mentions were functionally analyzed. The findings of the functional dimension of the present study showed that the most frequent discoursal role of <b>self-mentions</b> in the corpus was the recounter of research process, whereas the least frequent role was originator...|$|E
40|$|The {{view that}} {{academic}} writing is purely objective, impersonal and informational, {{which is often}} reflected in English for Academic Purposes materials, has been criticized {{by a number of}} researchers. By now, the view of academic writing as embodying interaction among writers, readers and the academic community as a whole has been established. Following this assumption, the present study focused on how second/foreign language writers enact, construct, and invent themselves through writing. In this study, the theoretical stance on identity is grounded on Ivanič’s (1998) four interrelated aspects of writer identity, namely autobiographical self, discoursal self, authorial self, and possibilities for self-hood in the socio-cultural and institutional contexts. Hyland’s model of metadiscourse (2004 a) was used as the analytical tool for analyzing texts. Based on a corpus of 30 research articles, the overall distribution of evidential markers, hedges, boosters, attitude markers, and <b>self-mentions</b> were calculated across four rhetorical sections (Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Discussion and Conclusion) of the research articles.

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine the}} view that {{research}} writing is a modest, self-effacing task which involves authors eradicating themselves from their texts to gain acceptance for their work. Conflicting advice in textbooks and style guides, and the apparently diverse conventions of different disciplines, mean that {{the extent to which}} writers can explicitly intrude into their discourse is highly problematic for students, teachers, and experienced writers alike. However, the choices which express writer presence are also closely associated with authorial identity and authority and these not only affect the ideational meaning that writers convey, but also influence the impression they make on their readers. <b>Self-mention</b> is therefore a powerful rhetorical strategy for emphasising a writer's contribution. Here I focus on the use of self-citation and exclusive first person pronouns in a corpus of 240 research articles in eight disciplines. Through an analysis of these texts and interviews with expert informants I seek to reveal something of how <b>self-mention</b> is used and perceived as a way of understanding more about writing in the disciplines and about the kinds of options available to students. © 2001 The American University.

40|$|This paper investigates {{patterns}} of rhetorical convergence and divergence in pairs of RA abstracts (English-Spanish and Spanish-English) {{published in the}} journal Ibérica. To that end, a total of 84 pairs of author-translated RA abstracts were analyzed. Based on the results of a pilot study, the following rhetorical patterns were analyzed in the corpus: text-referring expressions, degree of epistemic commitment, amplified attitude, <b>self-mention,</b> and periphrastic (e. g. multi-word) expressions. In addition, selected authorial input was requested to seek further explanations about the variation across these two languages. For text-referring expressions, broad cross-linguistic convergence was found in the expressions used {{and the degree to which}} the text is given agency. By contrast, the abstracts in Spanish were found to include greater degree of epistemic commitment, more amplified expressions of attitude, more <b>self-mention,</b> particularly in the plural first person, and periphrastic equivalents. Authorial input indicated that some of these diverging patterns were due to collocational differences but they were also influenced by beliefs about what is more natural in Spanish. Our results suggest that there may be specific lexical bundles performing intensifying functions in Spanish that deserve further investigation. These findings may have implications for ESP pedagogy and translation studies...|$|R

For this search we gathered twenty academic articles dealing with linguistics, ten per each language. Despite the different language types, Czech and English use similar means to express interpersonal features of metadiscourse.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} a corpus of ninety discussion sections of applied linguistics research articles, {{with the goal}} of analyzing different aspects of academic written discourse. Three types of texts were considered: English texts written by native speakers of English, English texts written by Iranians (as non-natives of English), and Persian texts written by Iranians. In order to understand the cultural differences between Persian and English-speaking researchers, the following metadiscourse sub-types adapted from Hyland's (2004) model were examined: transitions, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials, code glosses, hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers, and <b>self-mentions.</b> The first five comprise interactive metadiscourse, and the rest comprise interactional metadiscourse. After the detailed analysis of the metadiscourse types in question, chi-square tests were carried out to clarify the probable differences. The analysis revealed how academic writings of these groups differed in their rhetorical strategies using metadiscourse type because of their respective mother tongues. However, the different groups were found to use all sub-types of metadiscourse. Yet, some subcategories were used differently by the writers of these two languages. In addition, interactive metadiscoursal factors (those resources which help to guide the reader through the text such as transitions, frame markers, etc.) were used significantly more than interactional metadiscoursal factors (those resources involve the reader in the argument such as hedges, boosters, etc.) by both groups...|$|E
40|$|An {{appropriate}} {{representation of}} self {{is crucial in}} reporting past research, establishing a committed writer stance, and persuading the reader in academic writing. While research has suggested an underuse of authorial reference in student writing at the university level, less attention {{has been devoted to}} students preparing to enter university. In this study, I seek to investigate students’ usage and perceptions of reporting verbs along a continuum of authorial power at a community college in Hong Kong. Based on a revised averral framework by Charles (2006 b) and the reporting verb taxonomy by Hyland (2002 a), an analysis was performed on 614 academic written assignments (compared with proficient writing by native-speaking students in the UK in both frequency and textual examination), 697 questionnaires, and interviews with 13 students and three teachers. Findings reveal that the community college students were impassioned opinion holders characterized by an overuse of first person I in a cognitive, affective, and factive fashion. However, they overlooked the potential of ‘mitigated’ expressions of <b>self-mention</b> (such as it is argued that) and discourse verbs such as argue and suggest to develop an argumentative ethos and dialogic interaction essential in effective reader engagement. A misunderstanding of the purpose of academic writing, an insensitivity to reporting verbs, and a categorical forbiddance of <b>self-mention</b> by teachers appear to be the main reasons for not further developing a writer presence by Hong Kong students. In view of the low language proficiency of the students, conflicting writing guides, and teachers’ nonchalance about providing help, teaching recommendations were offered with the use of learner corpora and non-academic materials. published_or_final_versionApplied English StudiesMasterMaster of Arts in Applied Linguistic...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWriting is like {{a mirror}} that {{reflects}} the social and personal realities. Any culture and society has some specific ways and strategies for text and talk organization and communication, e. g. generic conventions, moves, metadiscourse markers, etc. are some of such strategies for better text organization and communication. Metadiscourse categories are specific rhetorical devices that help the participants to effectively {{communicate with each other}} (Hyland, 2005). Employing these interactional devices is different in various languages and societies, in other words metadiscourse strategies are context dependent. In order to find differences between the use of interactional metadiscourse strategies, in two different societies and contexts, we analyzed and critically interpreted their usage in the discussion sections of 40 research articles written by Iranian and English scholars in English. This critical analysis was based on the socio-cognitive approach of van Dijk. This analysis showed similarities and differences in the rhetorical behaviour of these authors in their use of interactional metadiscoursive strategies. There was a considerable tendency to the use of ‘hedging’ by both groups of writers. The main difference was in the use of <b>self-mentions</b> and engagement markers. The frequency rate of such strategies was very low amongst Iranian writers. The social constructions and cognition of participants may have undeniable effects on the use of interactional strategies. The findings of such studies can have useful implications for ESL, EFL, and ESP courses in general; and for developing academic literacy in particular...|$|E

The data collected using non-participant observation method and note taking techniques were analyzed with the theory of rhetorical moves in abstracts and metadiscourse. The results show that from 42 abstracts, only few abstracts from science belong to informational abstracts. Humanities tends to use three moves with the pattern PMR (Purpose, Method, Results); meanwhile, science andsocial science tend to use four moves with the pattern BPMR (Background, Purpose, Method, Results). On the whole, interactional metadiscourse is infrequently used. In terms of functions of metadiscourse in relation to moves, discourse goal (sub-type of frame markers) characterizes Move 2. Then, the resources of boosters which characterize move 4 are show, found, obtained, embodied, and revealed. Conclude (resources of frame markers sub-type—discourse stage) characterizes move 5. Some metadiscourse types related to the moves applied are evidentials, hedges, boosters, attitude markers and <b>self-mentions.</b> There are also certain resources in certain metadiscourse types which exist in certain move such as the resource of transitions and code glosses. In conclusion, only few abstracts from science support support Day’s (1995) model. In the use of metadiscourse, the use of interactive metadiscourse is dominant.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} multimodal discourse of academic posters from three disciplines, namely, Chemistry, Speech & Hearing Sciences and Linguistics, {{in an attempt}} to unravel how writers from different disciplinary communities build their communicative purposes into the verbal and visual modes in their posters. The analytical framework adopted for this study builds upon the one proposed by D’Angelo(2010), which incorporates Hyland’s metadiscourse model (2005) and Kress and van Leeuwen’s visual grammar paradigm (2006) for the verbal and visual analyses respectively, and supplements it with multimodal content analysis adapted from Jones’s (2007) model. Follow-up interviews with members of the discourse communities were also conducted to enhance the validity of the results. The findings reveal that there exist a wide range of differences in the use of metadiscourse markers (e. g. hedges, boosters, evidentials, code glosses) across the three group texts pertaining to disciplinary influences. There is also evidence that academics in different subjects value some of the same qualities in the texts necessitated either by the peculiar context of poster presentations (e. g. frame markers, engagement markers) or a need to maintain scientific formality (e. g. <b>self-mentions).</b> Visually, the concern for the context and ‘scientificness’ continue to exert great influences, rendering a myriad of visual manifestations (e. g. framing, modality) that are commonly shared across the data, whereas the cross-discipline discrepancy mainly narrows down to the image usage(functions and types). published_or_final_versionApplied English StudiesMasterMaster of Arts in Applied Linguistic...|$|E

40|$|Metadiscourse is an {{appealing}} field of inquiry which {{plays an important}} role in organizing and producing persuasive writing, based on the norms and expectations of people involved. The fuzziness of the term Metadiscourse remains obscure as it is seen in the literature. Having based this work on Ken Hyland’s framework for Metadiscourse, the researchers applied his definition and classification of the term. Hyland describes Metadiscourse as the linguistic resources used to organize a discourse or the writer’s stance towards either its content or the reader. He has divided Metadiscourse into two broad groups: Interactive and Interactional. The former being subcategorized into: Transitions, Frame markers, Endophoric markers, Evidentials, and Code-glosses. And the later being divided into Hedges, Boosters, Attitude markers, Engagement markers, and <b>Self-mentions</b> (Hyland, 2005). Focusing on these categorizations, the researchers would try to shed light on the Metadiscourse features applied in “Alice in Wonderland”, selected from the ‘Complete Illustrated Lewis Carroll’, and see how and to what extent Lewis Carroll has applied these Metadiscourse markers to make his story more impressive and persuasive. Of course, Hedges have not been counted in this novel because of the many works done about this marker earlier. The results of the study showed that the frequencies in Interactive/Interactional Metadiscourse groups have no meaningful differences. However, the frequencies demonstrate that the author has been fully aware of the norms of writing. The results of the study have pedagogical implications for teaching English Literature for literature students and language learners at pre-, upper-, and high-intermediate levels of language learning courses...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the ways English native and Arab EFL student writers in a UK university from two disciplines (i. e. Linguistics and Literature) use language in their master’s dissertations to interact with readers. How they present themselves and convey judgements and opinions, and how they connect with readers and establish rapport were examined by the employment of Hyland’s (2005 b) model of stance and engagement, which encompasses nine categories: hedges, boosters, attitude markers, <b>self-mentions,</b> reader references, directives, asides, questions, and references to shared knowledge. The primary data used consisted of a corpus of 39 master’s dissertations and discourse-based semi-structured interviews with 15 of the writers. While a corpus analysis helped to reveal which features were overused and which ones were underused, interviews were conducted to discover more about {{how and why the}} writer participants used such features in their academic writing. The findings suggest that {{while it is true that}} both disciplinary community and cultural background are very likely to have an impact on the way writers position themselves and their readers, there are other factors related to the students’ conceptions of academic writing in general and their audience in particular which appear to have a more vital role in the writers’ use of stance and engagement markers. These include personality differences, stylistic preferences, previous education, and supervisors’ comments and advice. The thesis closes by exploring the implications of this study for both EAP writing pedagogy and dissertation supervision and proposing some new directions for future research...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{metadiscourse}} in the dissertation abstracts {{written by}} Native Speakers of Turkish (NST), Turkish Speakers of English (TSE) and Native Speakers of English (NSE) in the Social Sciences {{to determine how}} they make use of metadiscourse devices. It attempts to determine whether student writers from a shared cultural background (Turkish) tend to use similar rhetorical features to those of their mother tongue or harmonise themselves with the language (English) {{in which they are}} writing. Metadiscourse as a rhetorical device for the effective use of language facilitates writers in guiding their readers, conveying their ideas, establishing and determining the social distance of the reader-writer relationship, and creating an involved style of writer persona or a more remote stance. In that sense, interactive resources employed by writers help readers to find the information needed and interactional resources convey to readers the personality of the writers and their assertions. In addition, using ‘more personal’ resources is a way of keeping readers more intentionally within the text to interpret what is proposed by the writers personally and to judge them. The overall aim of the study is to compare and contrast 90 abstracts of dissertations produced by native Turkish speakers (30), native English speakers (30) and Turkish speakers of English (30) in the Social Sciences and to consider how writing in English (L 2) deviates from writing in Turkish (L 1) and becomes closer to the target language in terms of the metadiscourse elements, that is, interactive resources (transitions, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials and code glosses) and interactional resources (hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers and <b>self-mentions).</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Academic {{communication}} is now {{widely seen as}} a social activity where writers interact with their audience. Various {{studies have shown that}} authorial presence {{is one of the key}} strategies for achieving this interaction. This corpus-based study examines the degree of authorial presence through the use of first person pronouns (I, we, my, our, me, us) in 150 qualitative and 150 quantitative research articles in Applied Linguistics using the concordance freeware AntcConc. 3. 4. 1 w (Anthony 2014). The analysis shows a greater use of <b>self-mention</b> by qualitative research writers compared with their quantitative counterparts, suggesting that research design determines the degree of personal involvement in academic communication within the same discipline. It also suggests that while quantitative research is considered “objective” in nature, the writers still position themselves in their writing and try to interact with their audience. Qualitative analysis of discourse functions of subject pronouns showed great similarity between the two sub-corpora (qualitative and quantitative), stating results/claims and elaborating arguments as being the most frequent functions...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of personal opinions and assessments is a ubiquitous feature of human interaction and, despite its apparently impersonal facade, also central to academic writing. In scholarly genres argument involves presenting {{a position on}} things that matter to a discipline in ways that disciplinary members {{are likely to find}} familiar and persuasive. Beneath its frozen surface, an academic text is seeking to build an appropriate relationship between the writer and the reader by anticipating the audience’s likely interests, knowledge, reactions and processing needs. We can, then, see academic writing as essentially dialogic as writers seek to engage and persuade their readers. In this introductory chapter I explore some of the ways that this is achieved. Based on an analysis of 240 published research papers I show how features of stance and engagement, such as hedges, <b>self-mention,</b> directives and reader pronouns, are not simply dry textualisations but elements of persuasive craftsmanship which help construct a disciplinary view of the world while simultaneously negotiating a credible persona for writers...|$|R
40|$|Self-mentioning: Authority, authorship or self-promotion in 17 thC prefaces to manuals on {{obstetrics}}? 1 Early Modern English {{texts on}} obstetrics {{have been a}} subject of study {{in the history of}} medicine and a source of a supposed antagonism between women midwives, {{on the one hand and}} surgeons and male midwives, on the other. Nevertheless, it can be questioned if sustaining this type of controversy was the main purpose of these works. This paper presents a discourse and pragmatic analysis of stance attribution in nine prefaces to obstetric books of mainly the 17 th C. By paying attention to <b>self-mentioning,</b> the main objective is to determine if their writers (a) defended the authority of a professional community, (b) emphasized their individual contribution to the obstetrics bibliography, or (c) were basically interested in selling their books. Texts have been accessed in digitalized facsimile form and the pronoun counting has therefore been performed manually. The results obtained, illustrated and completed with examples, show there ha...|$|R
