Such "unnatural " substances may include optical isomers, deoxy— congeners, dimers and metabolites from mammalian and human tissue, related, but not identical, to plant alkaloids. The chemistry and biological behavior of such "unnatural " alkaloids is presented. INTRODUCTION (<b>see</b> <b>Note</b> <b>a)</b> Most alkaloids isolated from plant materials are optically active and rarely encountered as racemates. Alkaloids used in medicine are usually pure enantiomers. It has often been demonstrated that biological activity is manifested by {{only one of the}} two enantiomers, frequently prepared by total synthesis of its racemate followed by optical resolution.

An Utopian report was published some 365 years ago under the title Nova Atlantis about the scientific and engineering state of the future. Describing 'laboratories, the report says: 'We also have glasses and means to see small and minute bodies, perfectly and distinctly; as [...] . the constituents of blood and urine, which are not otherwise visible ' (Note a). The author was Francis Bacon, once Lord Chancellor under James I and the originator of the term 'experimental natural sciences'. It took about 200 years for that vision to start to be turned into reality, when laboratories first emerged where blood and urine were studied systematically, for purposes of medical diagnostics. That period of time {{is characterized by the}} efforts of scientists and engineers to resolv...|$|E
