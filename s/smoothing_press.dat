Kegerreis retains the copyright to her book and has a series of Miss Rat stories that she hopes to publish soon.|$|R
5000|$|Baskerville's {{typeface}} {{was part}} of an ambitious project to create books of the greatest possible quality. Baskerville was a wealthy industrialist, who had started his career as a writing-master (teacher of calligraphy) and carver of gravestones, before making a fortune as a manufacturer of varnished lacquer goods. At a time when books in England were generally printed to a low standard using typefaces of conservative design, Baskerville sought to offer books created to higher-quality methods of printing than any before, using carefully made, level presses, a high quality of ink and very <b>smooth</b> paper <b>pressed</b> after printing to a glazed, gleaming finish.|$|R
2500|$|When {{he wished}} to print, he took an iron frame {{and set it on}} the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [...] was {{slightly}} melted, he took a <b>smooth</b> board and <b>pressed</b> it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone.|$|R
30|$|The {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} using Wig-L-Bug grinder with timer (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA), 50 ml polyethylene Nalgene vials (Nalge Nunc International Corporation, Rochester, NY, USA), glass beads, white cards, bird blade film applicator, 6 mm and 6 in. (15.2 cm) path, vacuum plate, Mylar film, cut from roll of approximately 2 – 3 in. 2 area, metal cylinder, metal plunger, metal base with a <b>smooth</b> top, hydraulic <b>press,</b> HunterLab and BYK colorimeter and laboratory larox (Labox).|$|R
5000|$|The main {{characteristic}} that sets apart three-mold ware from pressed glass {{is that the}} inverse of the pattern of three-mold glass can be felt {{on the inside of}} the object. Pressed glass is patterned only on the exterior and <b>smooth</b> inside. [...] <b>Pressed</b> glass, termed “mold-pressed,” has an interior form independent of the exterior, in contrast to mold-blown glass, whose interior corresponds to the outer form. [...] Plates, lamp bases and door knobs were usually made of pressed glass.|$|R

2500|$|There are {{a set of}} articulations {{that most}} {{instruments}} and voices perform in common. They are—from long to short: legato (<b>smooth,</b> connected); tenuto (<b>pressed</b> or played to full notated duration); marcato (accented and detached); staccato ("separated", [...] "detached"); martelé (heavily accented or [...] "hammered"). Many of these can be combined to create certain [...] "in-between" [...] articulations. For example, portato is the combination of tenuto and staccato. Some instruments have unique methods by which to produce sounds, such as spicatto for bowed strings, where the bow bounces off the string.|$|R
60|$|Anna {{thought nothing}} of the gift on the evening when {{he gave it to}} her. In the morning, however, when the butter was made, she fetched his seal in place of the old wooden stamper of oak-leaves and acorns. She was curiously excited to see how it would turn out. Strange, the uncouth bird moulded there, in the cup-like hollow, with curious, thick waverings running inwards from a <b>smooth</b> rim. She <b>pressed</b> another mould. Strange, to lift the stamp and see that eagle-beaked bird raising its breast to her. She loved {{creating}} it over and over again. And every time she looked, it seemed a new thing come to life. Every piece of butter became this strange, vital emblem.|$|R
40|$|Contact between curved rough bodies is an {{important}} engineering problem. The paper addresses the problem in its simplest form where a <b>smooth</b> rigid cylinder <b>presses</b> down an elastic half space bounded by a plane of uniformly spaced cylindrical asperities. Keeping the separation between the bodies unchanged the problem is inverted and solved using the method of complex variables. As the asperities deform as well as move as rigid bodies, contact lengths and positions develop non-symmetrically {{with respect to the}} initial axes of symmetry of the asperities. The resulting local contact pressures are non-Hertzian and the normal load for a given contact area is greater than that estimated using a priori Hertzian pressure profiles...|$|R
5000|$|Inexperienced homebuilders should {{experiment}} {{with a number}} of practice walls. This will ultimately expedite the building process and provide more satisfying results. When experimenting with M-I-M, (the more common form), two parallel 3 to 4 inch beads of mortar are laid down along the foundation, followed by a middle filling of insulation material. Then logs are laid on top with consistent mortar gaps, protruding no more than 1 inch on the inside and outside of the wall. Actual placement will depend on the size and shapes of the logs. Another layer of mortar is spread, then insulation poured in between, more logs follow and so on. When experimenting with Throughwall, a thin, even layer of insulative mortar is laid along the foundation, then the logs are seated firmly in the mortar bed, in an even fashion, leaving only enough space between them to [...] "point" [...] the mortar. The mortar gaps are filled to make a relatively flat top surface, then another thin layer of mortar is added and the process repeats. The shape and exterior orientation of logs is important only for appearance. Pre-split “firewood style” logs check less when in the wall and are easier to point or <b>smooth</b> and <b>press</b> evenly around than round pieces because the mortar gaps are generally smaller.|$|R
50|$|Sheng took sticky {{clay and}} cut in it {{characters}} as thin as {{the edge of a}} coin. Each character formed, as it were, a single type. He baked them in the fire to make them hard. He had previously prepared an iron plate and he had covered his plate with a mixture of pine resin, wax, and paper ashes. When he wished to print, he took an iron frame {{and set it on the}} iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste the back was slightly melted, he took a <b>smooth</b> board and <b>pressed</b> it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone. If one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.|$|R

60|$|In regard of the potter, popularly {{so called}} (says the plate), you don't {{mean to say}} you have {{forgotten}} that a workman called a Thrower is the man under whose hand this grey dough takes {{the shapes of the}} simpler household vessels as quickly as the eye can follow? You don't mean to say you cannot call him up before you, sitting, with his attendant woman, at his potter's wheel - a disc {{about the size of a}} dinner-plate, revolving on two drums slowly or quickly as he wills - who made you a complete breakfast-set for a bachelor, as a good-humoured little off-hand joke? You remember how he took up as much dough as he wanted, and, throwing it on his wheel, in a moment fashioned it into a teacup - caught up more clay and made a saucer - a larger dab and whirled it into a teapot - winked at a smaller dab and converted it into the lid of the teapot, accurately fitting by the measurement of his eye alone - coaxed a middle-sized dab for two seconds, broke it, turned it over at the rim, and made a milkpot - laughed, and turned out a slop- basin - coughed, and provided for the sugar? Neither, I think, are you oblivious of the newer mode of making various articles, but especially basins, according to which improvement a mould revolves instead of a disc? For you MUST remember (says the plate) how you saw the mould of a little basin spinning round and round, and how the workmen <b>smoothed</b> and <b>pressed</b> a handful of dough upon it, and how with an instrument called a profile (a piece of wood, representing the profile of a basin's foot) he cleverly scraped and carved the ring which makes the base of any such basin, and then took the basin off the lathe like a doughy skull-cap to be dried, and afterwards (in what is called a green state) to be put into a second lathe, there to be finished and burnished with a steel burnisher? And as to moulding in general (says the plate), it can't be necessary for me to remind you that all ornamental articles, and indeed all articles not quite circular, are made in moulds. For you must remember how you saw the vegetable dishes, for example, being made in moulds; and how the handles of teacups, and the spouts of teapots, and the feet of tureens, and so forth, are all made in little separate moulds, and are each stuck on to the body corporate, of which it is destined to form a part, with a stuff called 'slag,' as quickly as you can recollect it. Further, you learnt - you know you did - in the same visit, how the beautiful sculptures in the delicate new material called Parian, are all constructed in moulds; how, into that material, animal bones are ground up, because the phosphate of lime contained in bones makes it translucent; how everything is moulded, before going into the fire, one-fourth larger than it is intended to come out of the fire, because it shrinks in that proportion in the intense heat; how, when a figure shrinks unequally, it is spoiled - emerging from the furnace a misshapen birth; a big head and a little body, or a little head and a big body, or a Quasimodo with long arms and short legs, or a Miss Biffin with neither legs nor arms worth mentioning.|$|R
