40|$|Although the {{ecological}} economics (EE) discourse attempts to influence environmental policy, empirical studies {{have concluded that}} its success in this endeavour has been limited thus far. In the Netherlands, however, two EE-related policy concepts, Environmental <b>Utilisation</b> <b>Space</b> and Ecological Footprint, were strongly present in environmental policy during certain periods in time, but subsequently disappeared from the environmental agenda. The central question {{of this article is}} how these {{ups and downs of the}} EE concepts can be understood: which factors determine their rise on and fall from the policy agenda over time? To answer this question, this article offers a conceptual model informed by the approaches in political science on framing, agenda-setting and knowledge utilisation. We conclude that the interplay of concept-specific characteristics, the formation of coalitions around the concept and contextual variables explain the rise and fall of the aforementioned concepts. A match between the dominant policy frame and the core elements of the concept provides the opportunity for the two concepts to be pushed on the agenda. We observe the alternation of 'constraining' frames, which allows for EE concepts to survive, and 'reconciling' frames, which block agenda entrance for EE concepts. Furthermore, the alternation of these frames seems to correlate with economic and public environmental attention cycles in the Netherlands.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the scheduling of jobs on distributed, heterogeneous High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. Market-based approaches {{are known to}} be efficient for allocating limited resources to those that are most prepared to pay. This context is applicable to an HPC or cloud computing scenario where the platform is overloaded. In this paper, jobs are composed of dependent tasks. Each job has a non-increasing time-value curve associated with it. Jobs are submitted to and scheduled by a market-clearing centralised auctioneer. This paper compares the performance of several policies for generating task bids. The aim investigated here is to maximise the value for the platform provider while minimising the number of jobs that do not complete (or starve). It is found that the Projected Value Remaining bidding policy gives the highest level of value under a typical overload situation, and gives the lowest number of starved tasks across the <b>space</b> of <b>utilisation</b> examined. It does this by attempting to capture the urgency of tasks in the queue. At high levels of overload, some alternative algorithms produce slightly higher value, but at the cost of a hugely higher number of starved workflows.

5000|$|According to Zeithaml et al., layout affects {{how easy}} or {{difficult}} it is to navigate through a system. Two important aspects of layout are functionality and spatial layout. Functionality refers to extent to which the equipment and layout meet the customer's goals while spatial layout refers to how physical elements are arranged, the size of those objects and the spatial arrangements between them. [...] With respect to functionality of layout, designers consider three key issues; circulation - design for traffic-flow and that encourages customers to traverse the entire store; coordination - design that combines goods and spaces in order to suggest customer needs and convenience - design that arranges items to create a degree of comfort and access for both customers and employees. Spatial layout is closely related to <b>space</b> <b>utilisation.</b> Some research suggests that customers associate more spacious surroundings with higher quality services.|$|E
50|$|The 1960s {{also saw}} the swan song of the rear-engined rear-wheel-drive car RR layout. The first models {{designed}} with this layout in Central Europe before the second world war, had better traction than any other two wheel drive car layout. They were very capable in the mountainous country there, that had lots of unsurfaced roads, just how capable was shown by {{the performance of the}} two wheel drive military K√ºbelwagen version of the VW Beetle. This layout also had better interior <b>space</b> <b>utilisation</b> than front engine rear-wheel-drive cars, and a better ride than those with a live rear beam axle. It was an affordable way to produce a car with all round independent suspension, without the need for expensive constant-velocity joints needed by front-wheel-drive cars, or axle arrangements of FR layout cars. They could have road-holding issues due to unfavorable weight distribution and wheel camber changes (rear wheel tuck under), of the lower-cost swing axle rear suspension design. These were highlighted and a little exaggerated by Ralph Nader. These problems were ameliorated on later Beetles and were eliminated on the second-generation Chevrolet Corvair with the switch to a four-link, fully independent rear suspension. The Hillman Imp, NSU Prinz and Soviet Zaporozhets all had styling cues derived from the original Corvair. Connections to the Corvair are mentioned on their respective Wikipages. The only economy cars with this layout launched since the 1960s have been the turn of the millennium ultra compact two seater city car Smart Fortwo and Indian market Tata Nano.|$|E

Additionally it seeks to investigate Den sorte plads‚Äô potential as a solution to the marginalisation of the residents in Mj√∏lnerparken. This paper examines the accomplishments linked with the implementation of Den sorte plads, by collocating the opinion of the municipality with the inhabitant. Through theories regarding urban spaces alongside interviews with representatives from the municipality of Copenhagen, we analyse if Den sorte plads functions as intended. The concepts of affect and assemblage are used together with ethnographic studies, including participant observation, to study, which affects Den sorte plads provides. Furthermore, theories concerning the stranger in the city, as well as spaces and opportunities, are applied, to gain a profound understanding of the photographs from cultural probing and utterances from inhabitants, in order to analyse their view of Den sorte plads. In the end it is explained, that the municipality of Copenhagen and the inhabitants of Mj√∏lnerparken consider the city‚Äôs <b>space</b> and <b>utilisation</b> in correlation with the opportunity to conduct meaningful actions, and that these actions varies significantly.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding the {{internal}} structure of an asteroid {{has important implications}} for interpreting its evolutionary history, for understanding its continuing geological evolution, and also for asteroid deflection and in-situ <b>space</b> resource <b>utilisation.</b> Given the strong evidence that asteroids are seismically active, an in-situ passive seismic experiment could provide information about the asteroid surface and interior properties. Here, we discuss the natural seismic activity that may be present on Didymoon, the secondary component of asteroid (65803) Didymos. Our analysis of the tidal stresses in Didymoon shows that tidal quakes are likely to occur if the secondary has an eccentric orbit. Failure occurs most easily at the asteroid poles and close to the surface for both homogeneous and layered internal structures. Simulations of seismic wave propagation in Didymoon show that the seismic moment of even small meteoroid impacts can generate clearly observable body and surface waves if the asteroid's internal structure is homogeneous. The presence of a regolith layer over a consolidated core can result in the seismic energy becoming trapped in the regolith due to the strong impedance contrast at the regolith-core boundary. The inclusion of macroporosity (voids) further complexifies the wavefield due to increased scattering. The most prominent seismic waves are always found to be those traveling along the surface of the asteroid and those focusing in the antipodal point of the seismic source. We find also that the waveforms and ground acceleration spectra allow discrimination between the different internal structure models. Although the science return of a passive seismic experiment would be enhanced by having multiple seismic stations, one single seismic station can already vastly improve our knowledge about the seismic environment and sub-surface structure of an asteroid. We describe several seismic measurement techniques that could be applied in order to study the asteroid internal structure with one three-component seismic station...|$|R

As a framework, problems of perceptual research is dealt with and the possibilities to making general and valid notions on phenomena that occur from subjective experiences. The first part analyses how motion affects human perception of <b>space,</b> the <b>utilisation</b> of <b>space</b> and its ability to fulfil it's aim. A perceptual analysis of a baroque monastery in Bavaria illuminates how body motion strongly affects the perception of space indicating how different rooms' functions can be enhanced by accentuating wanted motions - and by the suppressing of unwanted ones. A number of experiments are presented where the aim is to investigating how humans move in relation to various objects and how architectural forms can be utilised to govern these motions. The choreo-graphic influence of space is described and an example of how this know-ledge can be utilised is presented. The second part discusses how choreographic influence of space affects a city's social everyday and public life. An analysis of a classisistic ideal city in Poland illuminates the connection between a city's structure, the design of city space and a city's social life. Especially is stressed the need for hierarchies and boundaries that can form a social playground for human actions. From the knowledge of how perception depends on motion and the need for a social playground, a modern suburb in Gothenburg is analysed.
