Result obtained indicates that the corrosion rate of mild steel in hydrogen cyanide {{in the presence of}} <b>sodium</b> benzoate/sodium <b>sulphite</b> inhibitive mixtures range 0. 322 mmpy to 1. 1269 mmpy across the three volumetric ratios considered. The 15 ml 5 ml <b>sodium</b> benzoatesodium <b>sulphite</b> mixture had the best average corrosion rate of 0. 5123 mmpy.

40|$|The {{influence}} of sulphonic and carboxylic acid groups {{in combination with}} the effect of counter ion form, on the swelling capacity of mechanical pulp fibres was studied by means of water retention value (WRV) measured in the temperature range from 25 to 95 oC. Mechanical pulp fibres (TMP) were treated with hydrogen peroxide and/or <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite</b> during conditions resembling those used in chemimechanical and bleaching processes commonly used in the industry. In conventional chemimechanical processes sulphite treatment is used before refining while peroxide treatment can be utilized both before and after refining. In this study we did however also use sulphite after peroxide treatment. When subjecting <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite</b> treated pulps to a subsequent hydrogen peroxide step, all pulps show a decrease in sulphonic acid groups, which could be owed to dissolution of highly charged lignin. Pulps treated with a high hydrogen peroxide charge (4 %), showed a loss in carboxylic acid groups during subsequent treatment with <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite.</b> This loss is probably due to dissolution of highly charged fibre material such as demethylated pectins. Both increased degree of sulphonation and carboxylation of the lignin reduces the softening temperature by means of reducing the degree of cross-linking in the lignin matrix. This softening probably improves the compressibility of the fibre pads in the sample holders of the WRV centrifuge, which would counteract an otherwise expected increasing WRV-value due to increased swelling potential. This makes it difficult to see clear trends in WRV as a function of increase in degree of sulphonation and carboxylation.

40|$|Foi estudado o efeito da homogeneização e da adição de sacarose, sulfito de sódio e lecitina na solubilidade das proteínas do extrato hidrossolúvel de soja em pó (EHSP). O calor aplicado durante o tratamento térmico do extrato hidrossolúvel de soja líquido (EHSL) a 90 ± 2 °C por 15 minutos e a secagem afetaram drasticamente a solubilidade das proteínas, provocando uma diminuição no índice de solubilidade do nitrogênio (ISN), de 90, 57 % no grão de soja descascado para 25, 31 % no EHSP usado como controle. Porém, os valores de ISN para os EHSP que continham sacarose, sulfito de sódio e lecitina, assim como daquele que foi homogeneizado foram significativamente maiores do que o do EHSP (controle) que sofreu apenas tratamento térmico. The {{effect of}} {{homogenization}} and addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite,</b> sucrose and lecithin was studied on the protein solubility of water soluble soybean extracts (WSSE). The heat {{treatment of the}} water soluble soybean liquid extracts at 90 ± 2 °C for 15 minutes and drying had a large effect on the protein solubility, decreasing the nitrogen solubility index (NSI) from 90. 57 % in the dehulled soybean to 25. 31 % in WSSE used as control. However, the NSI values of the WSSE containing sucrose, <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite</b> and lecithin {{as well as that}} one homogenized were significantly higher than the NSI of the WSSE (control) which recieved heat treatment only...|$|R
40|$|Reaction of 6 -quinolinol with {{formaldehyde}} and <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite</b> {{gives the}} bisquinolinol (1 b). Similar reaction of 6 -quinolinol with sodium 2 -hydroxy 1 -naphthylmethanesulphonate gives 1 c. Oxidation of 1 b with K 3 Fe(CN) 6 or KOBr gives the spiroquinolinone 2 b, while oxidation of 1 c with K 3 Fe(CN) 6 {{results in the}} formation of spirodienones 2 c and 2 d, and the dispiroketones 7 b and 7 c. Oxidation of 1 c with DDQ, however, results in only the spirodienones 2 c and 2 d. The spirodienone 2 d and the bromospiroquinolinone 2 e are formed in the reaction of 1 c with KOBr...|$|R
40|$|Renewable and {{biodegradable}} bioplastics can {{be produced}} from biopolymers such as proteins. Animal blood is a by-product from meat processing and is rich in protein. It is dried into low value bloodmeal and is used as animal feed or fertiliser. Previous work has shown that bloodmeal can be converted into a thermoplastic using water, urea, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite</b> and triethylene glycol (TEG). To increase its range of applications and acceptance from consumers, the colour and odour was removed from bloodmeal using peracetic acid (PAA). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the bioplastic processing of 3 - 5 % (w/w) PAA treated bloodmeal. 3 - 5 % PAA treated bloodmeal powder was compression moulded using different combinations of water, TEG, glycerol, SDS, <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphite,</b> urea, borax, salt and sodium silicate at concentrations up to 60 parts per hundred bloodmeal (pphBM). Partially consolidated extrudates and fully consolidated compression moulded sheets were obtained using a combination of water, TEG and SDS. 4 % PAA treated bloodmeal produced the best compression moulded sheets and extrudates and was chosen for investigating the effects of water, TEG and SDS concentration on consolidation, specific mechanical energy input (SME) and product colour during extrusion. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed SDS was the most important factor influencing its ability to be extruded because it detangled protein chains and allowed them to form new stabilising interactions required for consolidation. The best extruded sample, which was 98 % consolidated and 49 % white, contained 40 pphBM water, 10 pphBM TEG and 6 pphBM SDS...|$|R
