40|$|Gold {{nanoparticles}} {{were supported}} on {{two types of}} carbon nanofibres with different degree of graphitisation. The investigation of these materials with an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope showed {{that the degree of}} the <b>surface</b> <b>graphitisation</b> strongly influences the structures of the supported gold particles. The more ordered graphitic layers of the carbon nanofibre surface led to Au particles more preferred to immobilise on their { 1 [*] 1 [*] 1 } plane, exhibiting more facet area. In contrast, disordered carbon nanofibre surfaces led to random orientation of supported particles. The different shape of similarly sized Au nanoparticles allowed determining the effect of support surface structures on the selectivity of the catalyst in the liquid-phase oxidation of glycerol, highlighting the higher C 3 product selectivity on the { 1 [*] 1 [*] 1 } surface. Based on these results, we could also gain new insight in the effect of Au nanoparticle size on the selectivity in the liquid-phase oxidation of glycerol, that is, larger particles were more selective toward C 3 products than the smaller ones...|$|E
40|$|Using {{pulsed laser}} ablation, a novel method has been {{successfully}} developed for the generation of micro-features in diamond thus enabling the production of precision abrasive like micro-cutting elements into solid diamond micro-grinding tools. This paper examines {{the effects of the}} laser ablation on the generation of abrasive micro-features in diamond by using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Site specific specimen preparation by a focus ion beam (FIB) material removal process has been made possible by the application of platinum and tungsten protective layers, providing the necessary specimen surface stability during the ion beam milling and lift-out operations. The prepared thin section orientated orthogonally to the cutting edge of a laser generated abrasive feature, has allowed the identification of the graphite and diamond allotropes across the ablated interface using EELS. A sequence of TEM images has revealed the extent of <b>surface</b> <b>graphitisation</b> and the high integrity of the diamond substructure. TEM examinations at nanometric resolutions have allowed the visualisation of the diamond and graphite allotropes at molecular level while depicting the abrupt graphite to diamond transition resulting in a highly defined boundary, thereby endorsing the capabilities of the laser ablation process to generate cutting edges with minimal structural damage...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{and theory}} are {{employed}} {{to investigate the}} laser ablation of boron doped diamond and tetrahedral amorphous carbon using nanosecond pulses. For a single pulse at low values of fluence, the laser induces a swelling of the <b>surface</b> due to <b>graphitisation,</b> whilst {{a high level of}} fluence leads to recession of the surface due to vaporization. To understand and investigate the underlying phenomena during the diamond-laser interaction, a model has been developed to reliably and quickly predict the behaviour of the surface and the thickness of the heat affected zone. The model is based on conservation of heat and mass during the laser-workpiece interaction. It consists of a one-dimensional system of non-linear equations that models the material heating, evaporation, graphitisation and plasma shielding. There is excellent agreement between numerical and experimental results for the position of the interfaces up to a high laser fluence. This model is the first to investigate the ablation of diamond that is able to capture surface swelling due to the graphitisation of the diamond layer, the graphite thickness and the amount of ablated material within a single framework. Furthermore, the model provides a novel methodology to investigate the thermal stability of diamond-like carbon films. The activation energy for tetrahedral amorphous carbon is obtained using the model with an accuracy of 3. 15 + 1. 0 âˆ’ 0. 22 eV...|$|R
