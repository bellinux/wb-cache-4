Experimental observations for the optical energy gaps for thin films of GdN, DyN, SmN and EuN are made for the first time. Thin films are grown by thermal evaporation in ultra high vacuum environment and are passivated by MgF₂ layers. Initial characterizations indicate the polycrystalline thin films of RENs are strongly textured along [111] direction. Optical characterization techniques, Fourier transform infrared and conventional UV/Vis spectrometers are {{used in conjunction with}} SQUID magnetometer and DC electrical resistivity. Transmission and reflection spectra for rare earth nitride thin films were obtained in the photon energy range 0. 5 – 5. 5 eV in their paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. Paramagnetic GdN has a direct energy gap of 1. 30 ± 0. 05 eV which coincides well with theoretically predicted energy gap. A red-shift in the fundamental absorption edge of ferromagnetic GdN is observed along with onset of absorption at higher energy attributable to the exchange splitting of conduction and valence bands of GdN. The spin <b>split</b> <b>joint</b> density of states is in remarkable agreement with theoretically calculated spin polarized band structure of GdN. Similarly for DyN a consensus is found between theory and experiment on the energy gap of 1. 20 ± 0. 05 eV at room temperature. However, in the case of SmN, an energy gap of 1. 30 ± 0. 1 eV is underestimated by theory to 0. 81 eV. For EuN, the experimentally determined value of energy gap is 0. 97 ± 0. 05 eV. This value is used to tune the band structure calculation by QSGW theory which returns a ferromagnetic semiconducting solution for EuN...|$|E

50|$|The {{success of}} wrestling on {{television}} did however create a better {{opportunity for the}} independent groups. The opposition to Joint came from the Australian-born promoter, Paul Lincoln. Having promoted shows in the 1950s with himself in the main event as masked heel Doctor Death, Lincoln led a consortium of independent promoters under the British Wrestling Federation (BWF) whose name was used for a rival championship, built around Heavyweight champion Bert Assirati who <b>split</b> away from <b>Joint</b> Promotions in 1958 while still champion. Although Joint Promotions considered the title vacant and held a tournament for a new champion (won by Billy Joyce), Assirati continued to claim it within the BWF.|$|R
5000|$|By 2001, the Schusters' {{marriage}} had deteriorated. In February 2002, Larissa filed for divorce, which {{would prove to}} be acrimonious. Larissa and Tim fought over custody of their son Tyler and the <b>splitting</b> of their <b>joint</b> assets. Larissa was eventually awarded primary custody of Tyler and was allowed to stay in the couple's house. Tim moved out into a condominium, but in August 2002, Larissa and her lab assistant James Fagone broke into Tim's home to retrieve some of her belongings. Larissa reportedly stated to her friend, Terri Lopez: [...] "Well, I want husband dead. You don't understand. I could do it and get away with it." ...|$|R
40|$|The sum-capacity of a three user {{interference}} {{wired network}} for time-varying channels is considered. Due to the channel variations, {{it is assumed}} that the transmitters are only able to track the connectivity between the individual nodes, thus only the (alternating) state of the network is known. By considering a special subset of all possible states, we show that state <b>splitting</b> combined with <b>joint</b> encoding over the alternating states is required to achieve the sum-capacity. Regarding upper bounds, we use a genie aided approach to show the optimality of this scheme. This highlights that more involved transmit strategies are required for characterizing the degrees of freedom even if the transmitters have heavily restricted channel state information...|$|R
