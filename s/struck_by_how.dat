5|$|In 1965, Robert McSpadden and Bill Dickinson, both music {{teachers}} in the Cincinnati Public Schools, founded the Cincinnati All-City Boy Choir, where they were <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> the discipline they established for {{the boys in the}} choir carried over into their academic studies. They conceived the idea of a school where basic education was combined with intensive attention to children with artistic talents. With the support of Waldrip and Tom Murray, director for the west-central division of Cincinnati elementary schools, they pushed for $119,000 as part of a tax levy referendum in May 1973; the measure was defeated. The school was approved with a drastically reduced budget of $27,000 plus $9,850 from the Board of Education’s general fund. They turned to private funding and won a $292,000 grant from J. Ralph Corbett, one of the city's foremost philanthropists for the arts, and $24,500 for a piano lab from the Baldwin Piano Company, which had manufactured pianos in Cincinnati since 1891.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Paul Lemoine of Nantes, France {{had already}} {{published}} {{a study in}} a French medical journal in 1968 about children with distinctive features whose mothers were alcoholics, and in the U.S., Christy Ulleland and colleagues at the University of Washington Medical School had conducted an 18-month study in 1968–1969 documenting the risk of maternal alcohol consumption among the offspring of 11 alcoholic mothers. The Washington and Nantes findings were confirmed by a research group in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1979.

When the team determined it would take {{less than a year}} to remaster the entire game, Aonuma approached Miyamoto about developing it. He faced considerable reluctance from management due to players' mixed response in 2003, but by this time Nintendo staff were discussing the [...] "Zelda cycle" [...] and the fact that opinions of the game had warmed over the years, and Miyamoto greenlit development.

40|$|Families {{shape the}} {{individuals}} born into them in {{large and small}} ways, consciously and unconsciously; but the kinship dynamics that structure power in families {{are perhaps the most}} invisible of these forces. I doubt that Jane Austen consciously mapped out the maternal and paternal lineage of her characters or calculated their social power within their families in these terms. But she was a creature of her society and well-attuned to gradations of material advantage and social power; and so the nuances of the families she imagined fully reflected the weighting of power that came from the kinship structures and inheritance practices of the day.

40|$|There is no {{shortage}} of theories of prosocial behavior. Sociology, psychology, and economics are blessed with many such theories. When one looks at all three fields, one is <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> confusion. <b>How</b> do the various theories add up? Do they rival each other? Do they complement each other? Are they simply incompatible? Can one simply ignore some of them? These questions are not easy to answer because variables in these theories are often different, at least in name. For example, the dependent variable is given many names and it is not immediately obvious what the differences, if any, are. The terms prosocial behavior and helping behavior are most often used in psychology. In sociology, the term solidarity or solidary behavior is most often used; and in economics we find the terms cooperation and cooperative behavior. At times, the term altruism is used in all three fields. Do all these terms refer to the same thing? The independent variables are even more diverse and difficult to compare. Thus, there is a discount factor in “super games,...|$|R

Overlaying {{the music is}} a voiceover, courtesy of English actor John Standing, that lists the basic 'elements' {{that make up the}} world: ash, metal, water, wood, fire, and (eventually, later in the song) sky. The second track, [...] "Space Walk", is set to a recording of Ed White's 1965 space walk on the Gemini 4 mission. Franglen and Deakin chose to use the sample after listening to an album called Flight to the Moon (1969); the two were <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> moving and emotive many of the tracks were.

40|$|I]f {{one thinks}} about it, {{there are many}} {{political}} institutions that are interesting precisely because {{if we look at}} them today we are <b>struck,</b> simultaneously, <b>by</b> <b>how</b> little and how much they have changed over time. (Thelen, 2003 : 211) Debate around the regulation of the third or voluntary sector has been a sleeper issue in Canadian public policy and administration. While the third sector has been actively pressuring for changes to public policy – and specifically regulatory reform – for the past decade, there has been little political or public interest in such reform. This is not surprising, one might say, for a small sector that is driven largely by well intentioned people doing good work, often on a volunteer basis, for the benefit of others. This stereotype of the third sector is badly outdated, however, if not plain wrong from the start. While the contributions of the voluntary sector {{as an integral part of}} the welfare state and the broader delivery of public services have come to be quite widely recognized, recent studies are demonstrating its economic significance as well...|$|R

[...] It was built at Cinecittà, where the epic films Ben-Hur (1959) and Cleopatra (1963) had been filmed. Production designer Joseph Bennett built a set that emphasized authenticity and realism rather than grandiosity. He said, People think of Rome as white and cold and beautiful, powerful but distant. But based on the research, I don't think it was like that at all. If you go to Pompeii, you're <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> garish it is, even now.

Following that, lightning phenomena is herein considered as a possible factor that may promote changes in the structure, and eventually, in the strength of soils. The current study aims to analyse the influence of laboratory simulated lightning in the structure of undisturbed granite-gneiss residual soil samples. The main focus is to compare the peak strength of unsaturated samples that were not <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> replicated lightning with the peak strength of soil samples <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> replicated lightning.

As results, it is seem that lightning may cause a hole with irregular geometry inside the soil. Analysing the tests of the samples <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> laboratory simulated lightning, a peak strength reduction with the charge incidence was observed. Comparing the variation of soil matric suction on the peak strength of the soil that was not <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> replicated lightning with that of the soil <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> the higher charge of the replicated lightning, it is observed that the samples <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> high-voltage presents lower values of peak strength...|$|R

500|$|Two {{years of}} {{kindergarten}} were offered, beginning at age four, and students progressed through to first grade {{with other students}} their age. The Cottage School was free to all students, and was supported both by Coonley's own resources and funds raised by the Kindergarten Education Association. The Association, of which Coonley was president, promoted new educational ideas and raised money to help support them. In 1915, John Dewey and his daughter Evelyn featured the Cottage School in their book, The Schools of To-Morrow, which examined how progressive {{schools around the country}} put new educational ideas into action. They were especially <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> prominently nature featured in school life, noting that they have, for example, a rare bird that is as much a personality in school life as any of the children, and the children, having cared for him and watched his growth and habits, have become much more interested in wild birds. In the backyard is a goat, the best liked thing on the place, where the children have raised him from a little kid; and they still do all the work of caring for him. The Deweys held the Cottage School as an example of training in good citizenship, commenting on its mock elections, self-government, and public service: [...] "The school organized by the pupils into a civic league has made itself responsible for the conditions of the streets in certain portions of town, and is not only cleaning up but trying to get the rest of the town interested in the problem." [...] The teaching of English was also noted, as it was not taught as a separate subject but as part of history lessons, journal-keeping, and other exercises.
