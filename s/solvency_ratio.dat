40|$|Investors' {{learning}} {{of the state of}} future real fundamentals from current inflation leads to macroeconomic state dependence of asset valuations and <b>solvency</b> <b>ratios</b> of firms within given rating categories. Since credit spreads are convex functions of <b>solvency</b> <b>ratios,</b> average spreads are higher than spreads at average <b>solvency</b> <b>ratios.</b> Macroeconomic shocks carry risk premiums so that expected default losses are more sensitive to changes in the price of risk than are credit spreads. By incorporating state dependence and increasing the price of risk, the econometrician obtains high credit spreads while maintaining average default losses at historical levels—the credit spreads puzzle.

40|$|We take {{a closer}} look at the links between {{corporate}} capital structure and productivity, profitability and access to finance based on Danish industry-level and firm-level accounting data from the period 2000 - 2011. Our results indicate that the capital structure has no significant impact on the firms' profitability or productivity. However, the capital structure is important in relation to the range of financing options available to the firm and its funding and refinancing risks. Our analysis shows that small and medium-sized enterprises with high <b>solvency</b> <b>ratios</b> tend to have a higher acceptance rate when they apply for bank loans than corresponding firms with low <b>solvency</b> <b>ratios.</b> We also find that firms issuing exchange-traded stocks have higher <b>solvency</b> <b>ratios</b> than unquoted public firms. Finally we compare the corporate capital structure in Denmark with other EU countries based on aggregated financial accounts statistics. The overall funding pattern of Danish firms is quite similar to the one found in the other European countries. However, the Danish firms tend to a somewhat lesser extent to use market based funding such as quoted shares and corporate bonds which might reflect a large and well-functioning Danish market for mortgage bonds and the prevalence of industry foundations in Denmark...|$|R

Within this research field, two major models can be classified [...] - “classical statistical models ” and “stochastic intensity models”. However few of them can obtain probability of insolvency and expected ratio of liquidity gap at the same time. In addition, within the above two frameworks, few studies apply stochastic <b>solvency</b> <b>ratio</b> models to predict corporate liquidity crisis. Basing upon the two significant characteristics of <b>solvency</b> <b>ratio</b> [...] “mean-reversion ” and “non-negative value ” {{and the concept of}} varying coefficient model, the study develops a multi-period corporate {{short-term credit}} risk model by constructing an ”time-dependent stochastic <b>solvency</b> <b>ratio</b> model”. It considers the impacts of industrial economic state changes on the structure of a firm’s <b>solvency</b> <b>ratio</b> process (i. e. the parameters of the <b>solvency</b> <b>ratio</b> model) through incorporating information generated from a stochastic model of industrial economic state.

40|$|The European Project Solvency II {{is devoted}} to the {{appraisal}} of a Solvency Capital Requirement that should capture the overall risk profile of insurance companies. In this framework there is a growing need to develop so-called internal risk models to get accurate estimates of liabilities. In the context of non-life insurance, it is crucial to correctly assess risk from different sources, such as underwriting risk with particular reference to premium, reserving and catastrophe risks. In particular the underwriting cycle is not quantified in standard formula under Quantitative Impact Study 4, but probably it could be included, as it provides additional volatility to liabilities distribution and so it could increase the capital requirement. The aim {{of this paper is to}} correctly model the underwriting cycle for non-life insurance companies, also taking into account its effect on the <b>solvency</b> <b>ratio.</b> Starting from Collective Risk Theory, a dynamic control policy is defined to specify the relationship between <b>solvency</b> <b>ratio</b> and safety loading, to model the underwriting cycle. The corresponding dynamic equation for the <b>solvency</b> <b>ratio,</b> under some assumptions, assumes the form of a one dimensional piecewise linear map. In the first part of the work a deterministic version of this map is analyzed, where aggregate losses are simply regarded as a parameter.
