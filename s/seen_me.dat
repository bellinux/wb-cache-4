5|$|Yesterday, as my orderly {{was holding}} my horse, I asked {{him where he}} was from. He said he was from Hawaii! He {{proved to be a}} full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have <b>seen</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

500|$|The album's artwork {{was taken}} at [...] "the Farm" [...] in Juliette, Georgia. The cover art {{features}} Trucks' son Vaylor, while {{the back cover}} featured Oakley's daughter Brittany. The gatefold spread reveals {{a photo of the}} band and their extended families. [...] "I have an almost dreamlike memory of the way things were—parties, people giving the horses beer, various people in and out," [...] said Brittany Oakley in 1996. She noted that despite the good memories, [...] "it was painful" [...] following her father's death, which is when the photo was taken. Vaylor Trucks later went on to study at Florida State University, where he formed a band. To promote a concert, they printed covers of the Brothers and Sisters album cover with the caption [...] "Have you <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> lately?", which led to a sold-out crowd.|$|E
500|$|A {{week before}} the tour began, Spears said of the show: [...] "I come from Broadway, so I {{want it to be}} very theatrical. The whole process for me is magical. Hopefully it will be {{something}} people have never even imagined or envisioned in their head. I was going through a run-through yesterday and was thinking, 'By the time I'm 30, there's not going to be anything left for me to do'". Initial rehearsals for the band started on September 9, 2001. She joined them later after rehearsing the choreography in Los Angeles. [...] The setlist was composed mostly by songs from Britney. She explained her decision in a press conference, saying, [...] "I just want my fans to see me in a different light than they have ever <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> [...] before. This music I am singing right now is such a reflection of me and who I am. Hopefully [...] will come to the show and be inspired and have a lot of fun." [...] Several songs from her previous albums ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again were remixed by Robson to [...] "take [...] in a new direction– flip [...] up a bit".|$|E
500|$|Before the album's release, in December 2012, Cudi {{dedicated}} Indicud to {{the late}} Ben Breedlove and all his fans who died, continuing: [...] "My journey shall continue in your honor. Never forgotten." [...] The dedication was ultimately included in the album's liner notes. The album is upbeat and optimistic, very much unlike his previous studio album [...] (2010), which was considered darkly erratic. The positive vibe stems from Cudi's desire to always change and reinvent: [...] "I always try to push myself {{to the next level}} with everything I do. Since I've been in the business, critics have known that about me. When I started working on Indicud, I just wanted to bring more energy into my sound. Most of my old music was driven towards relaxed, chilled out smoke music. And that was my goal first coming in. Now it's like, 'What’s a side of me that people haven’t seen?' The only time people have <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> on up-tempos is on remixes or some shit. So I just wanted to take the energy to the next level. That ultimately inspired the subject matter. It was a chain reaction. With the up-tempos came more positive lyrics. It just brightened up the whole shit." ...|$|E

500|$|The Dhoom series {{began with}} the release of Dhoom in 2004. The film became a {{commercial}} box office hit and received generally positive reviews from audiences, but not so much from critics. As a result, producer Yash Chopra announced plans for a sequel, titled Dhoom 2: Back in Action. John Abraham, portrayer of Kabir Sharma, the villain of the predecessor, was eliminated from the sequel because Chopra did not want Dhoom 2 to repeat the stories featured in its predecessor. Instead, Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai were introduced into the franchise as the sequel's main villains. Aishwarya Rai's character was summarised as Catwoman, a female fictional comic book femme fatale or anti-hero [...] Rai stated, [...] "All I can tell you is it would be nothing like anything you've <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> do before." [...] Producer Aditya Chopra told Rai to lose weight after she gained it for her role in 2004's Bride & Prejudice. Yash Chopra stated, [...] "But yes, the role does require Aishwarya to convey oodles of sensuality. She has asked {{for a couple of months}} to get into shape. We (at Yash Raj Films) are very clear about every character in every script and what's required of the actors. Before Dhoom, Esha Deol was specifically briefed about the look and the attitude she needed to cultivate. She readily agreed, and look at what Dhoom did to her career!" [...] Roshan also lost twelve pounds of weight at Aditya Chopra's request. With the exception of Abraham and Esha Deol, all of the other main actors in Dhoom were hired again for Dhoom 2.|$|E

2500|$|Most songs {{have been}} altered {{at some point}} during the band's history; the ones most often {{subjected}} to this treatment include [...] "Round Here," [...] "Goodnight Elisabeth," [...] "Rain King," [...] and [...] "A Murder of One." [...] Examples of this can be heard on the MTV Live at the 10 Spot disc from Across a Wire: Live in New York City (on which [...] "Round Here" [...] contains lyrics from [...] "Have You <b>Seen</b> <b>Me</b> Lately?") and the VH1 Storytellers disc ("Anna Begins" [...] has an extended midsection with new lyrics, and the introduction to [...] "Mr. Jones" [...] includes lyrics from [...] "Miller's Angels" [...] and from The Byrds' [...] "So You Wanna Be A Rock & Roll Star").

2500|$|From {{interviews}} with approximately two hundred families who followed Fard, Beynon concluded:Although the prophet lived in Detroit from July 4, 1930 until June 30, 1934, virtually nothing {{is known about}} him, save that he [...] "came from the East" [...] and that he [...] "called" [...] the Negroes of North America to enter the Nation of Islam. His very name is uncertain. He was known usually as Mr. Wali Farrad or Mr. W. D. Fard, though he used also the following names: Professor Ford, Mr. Farrad Mohammed, Mr. F. Mohammed Ali. One of the few survivors who heard his first addresses states that he himself said: [...] "My name is W.D. Fard and I came from the Holy City of Mecca. More about myself I will not tell you yet, for the time has not yet come. I am your brother. You have not yet <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> in my royal robes." [...] Legends soon sprang up about this mysterious personality ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{band played}} only two gigs in 1995. This allowed Duritz {{to write a}} set of songs that became the band's second album, Recovering the Satellites. [...] Released October 15, 1996, it was heavier than August and Everything After, perhaps due to the {{addition}} of second guitarist Dan Vickrey, who had joined in early 1994. A response to the sudden fame that [...] "Mr. Jones" [...] had brought, it contains lyrics such as [...] "These days I feel like I'm fading away / Like sometimes when I hear myself on the radio" [...] (from [...] "Have You <b>Seen</b> <b>Me</b> Lately?") and [...] "Gonna get back to basics / Guess I'll start it up again" [...] (from [...] "Recovering the Satellites"). Dealing with the theme of Duritz's unease with his newfound fame, the album was described as [...] "a concept album of sorts about {{trying to pick up}} the pieces of a family, a social life and a psyche shattered by fame." [...] This album contained the hit single [...] "A Long December" [...] which received medium to heavy FM airplay.|$|E
2500|$|Baby Emma Henry {{originated}} {{the role}} and played Vicki until 1988, when her parents moved to Scotland. The role was recast to Samantha Leigh Martin, who learned to call Susan Tully [...] "Mummy Shell" [...] and referred to Letitia Dean who played her mum's best friend, [...] "Daddy Sharon". Tully has commented, [...] "What's lovely about working with Samantha is that she's always happy. When it comes to work, she knows it's playing a pretend game, she knows my real name but she knows to call me 'Mummy Shell' when the cameras are running. If she isn't involved {{for a couple of}} weeks, I like to visit her at home, so she's always relaxed with me." [...] Tully worried about this when it came to filming scenes in 1989 where Vicki contracted meningitis and was hospitalised and placed in an incubator with tubes attached to her body. Tully said, [...] " [...] has <b>seen</b> <b>me</b> in all kinds of situations but I didn't know how she'd cope if I cried over her". At Tully's suggestion, the BBC built a hospital room with minimal equipment and a consultant was present to make sure the BBC had the details correct and that neither the viewers or Samantha would be too distressed. Tully insisted that the child was not present when she had to film scenes of Michelle sobbing over the incubator.|$|E
