25|$|Many legends, both {{confirmed}} and unconfirmed, exist {{concerning the}} famous Hickman Tunnels. The most popular legend {{is that there}} is a tunnel from <b>somewhere</b> <b>inside</b> the school traveling to Jefferson Middle School. Many versions say that the tunnel is in a state of complete or partial disrepair, others state that it is still intact. The tunnels are still in tact 2015-2016 school year in Hickman's school news paper, 'The P', had a teacher that allowed them to go down into the tunnels and take pictures and the pictures they took were featured in the school newspaper.|$|E
25|$|The {{border area}} between Afghanistan and Pakistan {{has long been}} one of the most {{dangerous}} places in the world, due largely to very little government control. It is legal and common in the region to carry guns, and assault rifles and explosives are common. Many forms of illegal activities take place, such as smuggling of weapons, narcotics, lumber, copper, gemstones, marble, vehicles, and electronic products, as well as ordinary consumer goods. Kidnappings and murders are frequent. Numerous outsiders with extremist views came from around the Muslim world to settle in the Durand Line region over the past 30 years. While most of the time the Taliban cross the Durand Line from Afghanistan into Pakistan and carry out attacks inside Pakistani cities, sometimes they cross from the Pakistani side of the border and attack Afghan security forces. Recently, 300 Taliban militants from Afghanistan's territory launched attacks on Pakistani border posts in which 34 Pakistani security forces were believed to be killed. It is also believed Swat District Taliban leader Maulana Fazlullah is hiding <b>somewhere</b> <b>inside</b> Afghanistan. In June 2011 more than 500 Taliban militants entered Upper Dir area from Afghanistan and killed more than 30 Pakistani security forces. Police said the attackers targeted a checkpost, destroyed two schools and several houses, while killing a number of civilians.|$|E

500|$|In 1981 Daniel Dennett had {{formulated}} another {{argument against}} the LOT. Dennett suggested that it would seem, {{on the basis of}} the evidence of our behavior toward computers but also with regard to some of our own unconscious behavior, that explicit representation is not necessary for the explanation of propositional attitudes. During a game of chess with a computer program, we often attribute such attitudes to the computer, saying such things as [...] "It thinks that the queen should be moved to the left." [...] We attribute propositional attitudes to the computer and this helps us to explain and predict its behavior in various contexts. Yet no one would suggest that the computer is actually thinking or believing <b>somewhere</b> <b>inside</b> its circuits the equivalent of the propositional attitude [...] "I believe I can kick this guy's butt" [...] in Mentalese. The same is obviously true, suggests Dennett, of many of our everyday automatic behaviors such as [...] "desiring to breathe clear air" [...] in a stuffy environment.|$|E
500|$|The film is Spielberg's {{third on}} the subject of alien visitation, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Producer and {{longtime}} collaborator Kathleen Kennedy notes that with War of the Worlds, Spielberg had the opportunity to explore the antithesis of the characters brought to life in E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. [...] "When we first started developing E.T., it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign. I think that the edgier, darker story has always been <b>somewhere</b> <b>inside</b> him. [...] Now, he's telling that story." [...] Spielberg stated that he just {{thought it would be fun}} to make a [...] "really scary film with really scary aliens", something which he had never done before. Spielberg was intent on telling a contemporary story, with Kennedy stating the story was created as a fantasy, but depicted in a hyper-realistic way.|$|E

Later, some blamed the entire incident on two {{people who had been}} playing cards in the pew during the sermon, thereby incurring God's wrath.|$|E

2500|$|Early on in {{the first}} quarter, Gil Reese fumbled a punt from Georgia's Joe Bennett; and the Bulldogs' own Jim Taylor {{recovered}} it on Vanderbilt's 25-yard line. The Commodores' defense stood tall, and Georgia was unable to score. At {{some point during the}} first quarter, Gil Reese foreshadowed what was to come with a 23-yard run. [...] Later on, the Commodores were to get their first score. With the first quarter just about to end, Bennett dropped back to pass. The ball hit off his receiver's finger tips, into the hands of Alf Sharpe for the interception. Alf Sharpe was tackled on Georgia's 30-yard line; the pass coming from <b>somewhere</b> <b>inside</b> the 25-yard line. On the ensuing Vanderbilt possession, Red Rountree ran up the middle for a 7-yard gain. Thomas Ryan ran through for 4 more yards and the first down. [...] Ryan ran three more times in a row to close out the quarter, netting another first down on the third carry. [...] This carried the Commodores to the 7-yard line before the quarter closed and teams had to switch sides.|$|E

[...] Film critic Patrick Z. McGavin said [...] "the movie requires extraordinary patience, and those inclined to surrender to the film's heavy mood and elusive rhythm are bound to experience a significant revelation." [...] The film's narrative {{has been described as}} [...] "frustrating" [...] and [...] "suffers from structural problems." [...] Sight & Sound said [...] "the film's dramatic narrative twist is clumsily rendered. Intended to disorientate, it comes over as contrived." [...] The Guardians Peter Bradshaw criticized the film's open-ended nature and how it left questions unanswered saying, [...] "there is an outstanding film <b>somewhere</b> <b>inside</b> this sprawling mass of ideas, which might have been shaped more exactingly in the edit." ...|$|E
