40|$|This paper {{describes}} an easy-to-implement, proactive control strategy for wind turbines, incorporating constraints on blade loads. The control strategy is aimed for rejecting wind gusts {{and is based}} on upwind speed measurements and a new statistical wind gust detection mechanism. The control action comprises simultaneous driveline and collective pitch control with constraints on flapwise bending moment. The controller is evaluated by simulation on a transient between two <b>steady-state</b> <b>operational</b> <b>modes</b> of the wind turbine. A new driveline backstepping-based controller with integral action for compensation of steady-state errors is also proposed and verified by simulations...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} and <b>steady-state</b> <b>operational</b> characteristics of a Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC). The mathematical description {{is based on the}} transformation of a three-phase system into an orthogonal synchronously rotating coordinate system, in which, under steady-state conditions, all the system quantities are constant values. Thus, at given parameters, it is generally possible to determine the dimensions of the device. The analysis of the <b>steady-state</b> <b>operational</b> characteristics resulted in key findings enabling derivation of control algorithms and further examination of the device operating under dynamic conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an apparatus for laminating a first {{and a second}} sheet with a plane carrier (10) and a drum shaped carrier (20) for carrying a respective sheet. The apparatus has a first main <b>operational</b> <b>mode</b> wherein the drum shaped carrier (20) is at distance from a first carrier surface (12) of the plane carrier (10) in said third direction (Z), and a second main <b>operational</b> <b>mode</b> wherein the drum shaped carrier (20) is close to first carrier surface to bring {{the first and the}} second sheet (1, 2) in contact with each other. In the first main <b>operational</b> <b>mode</b> the drum shaped carrier (20) is virtually rolled over the first carrier surface (12) and the sheets are mutually aligned. In the second <b>operational</b> <b>mode</b> the sheets are laminated...|$|R

40|$|Runtime {{variability}} {{is becoming}} an attractive technique to support those runtime scenarios for systems that demand some kind of autonomous reconfiguration or adaptive behavior. Nowadays, the challenge of many critical systems that need to handle different <b>operational</b> <b>modes,</b> often in an unattended mode, require specific solutions for which runtime variability mechanisms become relevant. This research describes the challenges of runtime variability to support multiple binding modes for handling the diversity of different <b>operational</b> <b>modes</b> and runtime reconfiguration needs.

40|$|The {{history of}} Dynamic Positioning {{shows that in}} most {{incidents}} the DP operator is involved. Reducing the amount of operator related DP incidents could therefore significantly increase the safety and reliability of DP operations. An operator’s workload during DP operations {{seems to be the}} most important cause of operator errors. By splitting DP operations into three different <b>operational</b> <b>modes</b> this workload problem could be resolved such that the operator’s performance will improve. To allow for this split in <b>operational</b> <b>modes</b> a self-diagnostics system and an operator support function should be added to a DP system. This paper will describe the problem of operator related incidents, the split into three <b>operational</b> <b>modes</b> and the function of a self-diagnostics system and operator support function...|$|R

As with Type 61, Type 65 only entered Chinese service in very limited numbers. It did see action in real battles, but not against foreign enemies: during the fractional fighting among Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution, Guards in Sichuan seized the Type 65 guns from the production factory and used the guns in battles against each other.|$|R
