5|$|Jenner has {{undergone}} cosmetic surgery, and completed sex reassignment surgery in January 2017. She said <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> sexually attracted to men, but has instead always been sexually attracted to women, and that, {{keeping in mind}} the difficulty people have understanding the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity, she will identify as asexual for now.|$|E

25|$|Reinhart {{has been}} {{recently}} lauded for her scatting techniques reminiscent of Fitzgerald, {{as well as}} for her yodeling. Her frequent call and response sessions during her live performances have also received particular praise. Reinhart's early vocal training came from her mother, and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> trained professionally. Growing up, she learned her scatting and call-and-response techniques from her father, who would scat and then make her repeat the sounds back to him.|$|E
25|$|She {{was one of}} {{hundreds}} of people reported to police as missing that day. Like those of other victims, her family posted flyers all over the city in an effort to find her. Her case was the only one not connected to the attacks, and, in order to generate media interest, her brother claimed to the media that he had last heard from her during the attack. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> found or otherwise accounted for.|$|E
25|$|The woman's corpse {{was never}} found, and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> located alive, if the body seen was not hers. At {{the time of}} Delta Dawn's discovery, the river bottom in the {{vicinity}} where it was seen was dragged in hopes of finding the remains, which was unsuccessful. Searches were also conducted with helicopters and boats. On December 9, the skeletal remains of an African-American man, aged eighteen to twenty-two were found, sixty yards away, {{by one of the}} search teams. He also remains unidentified, but is not likely connected to the case.|$|E

25|$|Claire {{lives with}} Agnes and Tobias {{and appears to}} have no means of support except for them. Her main role in life {{seems to be to}} annoy and embarrass her sister. She is {{everything}} that Agnes dislikes. Claire makes the statement, after telling Tobias that he {{would be better off if}} he killed Agnes, Julia, and herself, that she will never know whether she wants to live until Agnes is dead. With this statement, Albee makes it sound as if Claire holds Agnes up as a role model, a model that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> able to reach. And instead of trying to reach it, she has done everything to live her life in a diametrically opposed manner.|$|E
25|$|Mel is {{involved}} in high-profile storylines, such as a wedding to Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) to mark the Millennium Eve celebrations on New Year's Eve 1999, and later a problematic marriage to Steve Owen (Martin Kemp). Mel is heavily featured in a storyline marking the show's increase to four weekly episodes in 2001, when she is kidnapped by her former fling, Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). Outhwaite proved popular in the role and won multiple awards for her portrayal as Mel. Producers have indicated that the door is always open for Outhwaite {{to return to the}} role; however, Outhwaite revealed in 2010 that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> asked back. Outhwaite's return to the serial was announced in October 2017 and Mel will return in 2018.|$|E
25|$|The San Francisco Bay Area Reporter, Inc., a free weekly {{newspaper}} serving the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) {{communities in the}} area, {{were one of the}} first to comment on their discontent with the matter:We have repeatedly voiced our displeasure over the transgender/lesbian storyline between Zarf/Zoe and Bianca. We disagree with the basic premise, Zarf/Zoe as a MTF transgendered lesbian. We want Bianca to be with a woman (and she did have a one-night stand with Leslie on New Year’s Eve, which has to be a first for a daytime soap). We don’t want her already messy love life in which <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> allowed to have a fully realized relationship with another woman (her first lover went crazy and was institutionalized, her next was killed, the next was a corporate thief who then had to return to Poland, the next identical twin of the one who was killed wasn’t sure she was even queer and then left her for another woman). We don’t want her life complicated with the complexities of a transgender relationship.|$|E

25|$|Michelle Ann Fowler (also Holloway) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Susan Tully {{from the first}} episode in 1985 until the character's departure in 1995. In December 2016, it was announced Michelle would be returning to the show after 21 years, with actress Jenna Russell taking over the role making her first appearance on 24 December 2016. In her first stint Michelle made some huge mistakes during her time in Albert Square mainly through having a habit of choosing the wrong men and her stubborn nature meant that she rarely accepted help or listened to good advice. Being determined and outspoken, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> afraid to defend herself or her beliefs. Since the recast to Russell in 2016, Michelle's storylines have revolved around her having had an illegal relationship with her student, Preston Cooper (Martin Anzor) in America, a love triangle involving her niece Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield), crashing her car into the local chip shop and being stalked by Tom Bailey (Daniel Casey).|$|E
25|$|After a {{few months}} of being together, happy and in love, Robin has a {{pregnancy}} scare. Although the test is negative, she realizes she wants different things from life than Patrick. She wants more from him (children), while he is happy just the way they are. They eventually break up. Robin wants to be a mother and decides to be a single mom. She and her friend, Dr. Kelly Lee (Minae Noji), put a list of possible sperm donors together. Robin picks people in Port Charles, because she feels that they have redeeming qualities she will like to pass on to her child, and does not like the idea of her child's father being a stranger. On November 30, 2007, Patrick tells Robin that he still loves and misses her. He just wants them to be together again and asks her to table the discussion of children for a year, and while she has stated that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> happier than when she was with him, she knows nothing would be different in a year - she would still want kids and he would not, to which he sadly replies that she is probably right, {{but it would have been}} a great year.|$|E
500|$|Renée Michel is a 54-year-old widowed concierge. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> {{to college}} because she {{considers}} herself to {{always have been}} poor, discreet, and of no significance. Renée, however is self-taught; she reads works of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant and Russian writer Leo Tolstoy (and even names her cat [...] "Leo"), disdains the philosophy of Edmund Husserl, adores 17th-century Dutch paintings, likes Japanese art-house films by Yasujirō Ozu, and listens {{to the music of}} composers Henry Purcell and Gustav Mahler.|$|E

5000|$|Michaels {{immediately}} {{rejected the}} idea. Pressed by Gallagher, {{he explained that}} Doumanian wasn't a producer, that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> part of the show's [...] "core team", and that nobody who ever had been would work for her. He had also invited her to come work for him if he landed a deal with Paramount Pictures he had been considering.

500|$|Elle's first chronological {{appearance}} is in [...] "Four Months Ago...". During this time, the Company made Peter Petrelli their willing prisoner {{and in those}} months he was held, Elle seems to have developed a cute crush on him. Peter confesses that he likes the little jolts which Elle gives him as a tease and kisses her. She confides in Peter that she {{has lived in the}} Company's holding facility for 16 years. She also admits to being diagnosed as a sociopath; she explains at age six, she accidentally set her grandmother's house on fire and, at age eight, caused a major blackout in Ohio.

She also explains that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> on a date and has never been swimming.

500|$|It was {{not until}} the [...] finale that it is {{revealed}} that Grissom and Sara have worked through whatever issues they had, and are, in fact, a couple, and have been for two years. This revelation caused mixed reviews among critics, some of them see this relationship as CSI [...] "jumping the shark", an attempt to include more drama and romance to the show, so as to be able to compete with the medical drama Grey's Anatomy, which airs at around the same time. By killing off the sexual tension between the two characters and making them an item, the production crew were seen to be adding more personal drama to the show, increasing the appeal to some of Grey's Anatomys younger audience. This has been denied by the writers, Carol Mendelsohn even said that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> able to see Grissom with someone else other than Sara and that this episode was seen by the writers as the right time to reveal the relationship, Jorja Fox and William Petersen have also admitted that the relationship is not new.|$|E

500|$|It was {{not until}} the sixth season finale that it is {{revealed}} that Grissom and Sidle have worked through whatever issues they had and are, in fact, a couple. In season eight it was revealed they have been intimately involved for two years. This revelation caused mixed emotions from fans, some of whom see this relationship as CSI [...] "jumping the shark," [...] an attempt to include more drama and romance to the show to compete with the medical drama Grey's Anatomy, which airs in the U.S. at the same time. By resolving the sexual tension between the two characters, critics posited that the show might appeal to some of Grey's younger audience. This has been denied by the writers. In one interview, producer Carol Mendelsohn said that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> able to see Grissom with any other character other than Sidle and that this episode was seen by the writers as the right time to reveal the relationship. Jorja Fox and William Petersen have also said that the relationship between their characters is not new.|$|E
500|$|When the Carter family {{begin to}} {{struggle}} financially, Babe decides to help by selling alcohol before the allocated hours, despite it breaching The Vic's licensing laws. Badland explained that Babe [...] "deals with {{things in the}} way that she knows how but it doesn't always work out the way that she wants it to". Badland described Babe's actions as [...] "instinctive", which makes her [...] "often [...] on impulse". She questioned whether Babe could be [...] "an optimist and doesn't fully consider the damage she can cause." [...] Kathy Beale (Taylforth) decides to tip the authorities and after a series of undercover investigations, the police arrest Babe, Mick and Shirley. In her interview, Babe blames Mick and tells the police she was [...] "only acting on instructions". Despite this, they all spend the night in police custody. Badland revealed that Babe [...] "was assuming she could {{find a way out of}} it" [...] when blaming Mick because [...] "it's about staying alive in that moment." [...] She explained that Babe's actions stem from a fear of being arrested and said, [...] "For all she has ever been up to, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> in a prison cell so it was about her staying afloat in that precise moment." [...] Badland believed that Babe would be able to [...] "talk her way out of trouble with the Carters" [...] again and explained that [...] "the family have a lot to talk about – and a lot to find out about..." ...|$|E
500|$|Later on, Meg knocks Brian out, {{puts him}} {{in the trunk of}} his car and drives away. Chris tells Lois that he saw this, so Lois, Peter, Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire track them down at the Barrington Hotel. When they arrive, they see Meg has tied Brian up with {{packaging}} tape and is about to rape Brian. Lois tells Meg that she is not thinking right, although Meg insists that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> more sure of anything in her life. Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not know what she needs, and then Quagmire says (in an erotic tone) [...] "I know what she needs... Bring her by my house around 8:30 tonight I'll take care of her." [...] This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire's house, it seems even more likely; he tells her to sit down and says [...] "Soon it'll all become clear", puts on seductive music, dims the lights, strips down to a speedo and sits down beside her; but suddenly, Quagmire (uncharacteristically) begins to have a serious heart-to-heart talk with Meg, telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her and she should not be in such a hurry to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day. To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks into his bedroom, where two of his one-night stands await with an array of sex toys, {{and it turns out that}} all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst. One of the women asks Quagmire if he has the [...] "hwhip" [...] (with emphasis on the [...] "h") and Quagmire responds with disbelief.|$|E
