This further inspired her to launch her own fashion line. The line achieved popularity among celebrities and was worn by stars such as Teri Hatcher, Nicole Kidman, Paris Hilton and Stefani herself. The fashion line made a runway debut in the <b>spring</b> <b>collection</b> of 2004 and achieved mainstream success at New York Fashion Week in 2005.

The line, as well as the shows at which it was displayed, were well received by critics and appreciated the indulgence of a celebrity into the fashion world. An additional fashion line, called Harajuku Lovers, was subsequently launched by Stefani.|$|E

2500|$|Social media {{marketing}} provides {{organizations with}} a way to connect with their customers. [...] However, organizations must protect their information as well as closely watch comments and concerns on the social media they use. A flash poll done on 1225 IT executives from 33 countries revealed that social media mishaps caused organizations a combined $4.3 million in damages in 2010. The top three social media incidents an organization faced during the previous year included employees sharing too much information in public forums, loss or exposure of confidential information, and increased exposure to litigation. Due to the viral nature of the Internet, a mistake by a single employee has in some cases shown to result in devastating consequences for organizations. An example of a social media mishap includes designer Kenneth Cole's Twitter mishap in 2011. When Kenneth Cole tweeted, [...] "Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor has they heard our new <b>spring</b> <b>collection</b> is now available online at [...] ". [...] This reference to the 2011 Egyptian revolution drew an objection from the public; it was widely objected to on the Internet. Kenneth Cole realized his mistake shortly after and responded with a statement apologizing for the tweet.|$|E
