Officials at Widzew Łódź accused the PZPN of bias, saying the association had not supervised the players properly and should shoulder <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame.</b> Directors at Widzew and ŁKS Łódź briefly considered resigning their PZPN memberships and organising their own league championship, but did not. The national team players' council, {{at that time}} comprising Marek Dziuba, Paweł Janas and Wojciech Rudy, wrote an open letter expressing surprise at {{what they saw as}} excessive sanctions against Terlecki, Boniek, Żmuda and Młynarczyk. They admitted the goalkeeper's conduct had been far from exemplary, but contended that the incident was only minor, and had been exacerbated by disproportionately prominent and negative press coverage.|$|E
5|$|Considering its inexperience, Savige's 17thInfantry Brigade {{was given}} a {{complicated}} role in the Battle of Bardia.

The brigade had to move in four directions at once. The plan soon went wrong, as the 2/5th in particular suffered a series of mishaps. By nightfall, Colonel Frank Berryman, the divisional chief of staff, had reached the conclusion that the 17thInfantry Brigade had become too tired and disorganised for further effort. This was only partly due to enemy action; the rest was attributable to Berryman's own plan, which had dispersed the brigade and provided it with inadequate armoured and, in the final stages, artillery support. Savige also bore <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame,</b> for failing to ensure that his subordinates understood and carried out the plan.|$|E

Only two more wickets fell, though, as contributions from Ryan ten Doeschate, Graham Napier and Kaneria propelled Essex to 222 for 9 at the end of their 45 overs. Hampshire and England fast bowler Chris Tremlett got Napier, ten Doeschate and James Middlebrook out to end with three wickets for 48. Despite John Crawley and Nic Pothas recording a first-wicket partnership of 95, Kaneria kept his calm, only allowing 26 runs off his nine overs, and boundaries were rare after Pothas and Crawley were dismissed.

This era, the pamphlet claims, was now past and lost; the constitution of the gentleman has deteriorated.

Back in 1988, Al Holbert realized that the 962 was beginning to feel dated. He proposed a followup open-top Porsche powered racer which would also be sold to customer teams.

500|$|After {{only one}} {{season at the}} Nordiques, Hextall {{was traded to the}} New York Islanders in return for Mark Fitzpatrick during the off-season, a move made because the Nordiques could only protect one goalie for the {{expansion}} draft and instead of losing him chose to trade him to Long Island. The two teams also traded first round draft picks. The move was a surprise for Hextall, who had settled in well in Quebec with his family. Don Maloney, the Islanders' General Manager, described the trade as [...] "too good to pass up".

Hextall had a poor beginning to his career as an Islander, conceding 23goals in 14periods {{at the start of the}} season, resulting in his replacement prior to the third period against the New Jersey Devils in mid-October. During that game, in which the Islanders were playing at home, Hextall was jeered by the crowd, something to which he had become accustomed during his time with Philadelphia. In contrast to the fan's derision, Hextall's teammates backed him, taking <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blame</b> themselves, and expressing their belief in their new colleague. Steve Thomas suggested that Hextall was [...] "one of the best goalies in the league, easily in the top five or10," [...] while coach Al Arbour dismissed dropping Hextall, saying that [...] "We're not playing well in front of the goaltender and he can only be as good as the guys in front of him." [...] Any thoughts that Arbour might have had of replacing Hextall as the team's number-one goaltender were limited by the play of his back-up, Tom Draper, who recorded a GAA of4.23 in the seven NHL games he played that season. This, coupled with the lack of experienced goaltenders at the club's IHL affiliate, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles, resulted in Hextall starting 20games in a row until Jamie McLennan was called up from the Golden Eagles.|$|E
