30|$|Next, we {{construct}} our <b>simulator</b> <b>Ŝ</b> {{based on}} the <b>simulator</b> <b>S</b> in the “The view generated by the simulator” section. We need Ŝ {{to be able to}} emulate the execution for the man-in-the-middle and resetting adversary A in the protocol rNMZKF. For the adversary A, we divide its resetting attack in the left into two cases. The first case is that the new first message m 0 sent by A is different from all the first messages in the previous sessions on the left. Because our protocol rNMZKF uses the truly random function F, in such case, we can see it as a new session, and <b>simulator</b> <b>Ŝ</b> just does the simulation of the left and right interactions {{in the same manner as}} S. Additionally, when executing the part of resettably-roundness ZK protocol, the <b>simulator</b> <b>Ŝ</b> will act as an honest verifier on the left. The second case is that the new first message m 0 sent by A has been sent in a previous session, and then the <b>simulator</b> <b>Ŝ</b> just resends the responses from its history records of the corresponding session. This is because, for a fixed truly random function F, the transcript of the whole session are fixed when the message m 0 is fixed. Otherwise, we can use this experiment to break the binding property of the commitment scheme Com.|$|R

50|$|<b>Terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> (also called <b>terminal</b> boards or strips) {{provide a}} {{convenient}} means of connecting individual electrical wires without a splice or physically joining the ends. They are usually used to connect wiring among various items of equipment within an enclosure {{or to make}} connections among individually enclosed items. Since <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> are readily available {{for a wide range}} of wire sizes and terminal quantity, they are one of the most flexible types of electrical connector available. Some disadvantages are that connecting wires is more difficult than simply plugging in a cable and the terminals are generally not very well protected from contact with persons or foreign conducting materials.|$|R

50|$|Electrical and {{electronic}} components and devices sometimes have {{plug and socket}} connectors or <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks,</b> but individual screw terminals and fast-on or quick-disconnect terminals are more common.

50|$|Twist-on wire {{connectors}} are commonly color-coded {{to indicate the}} connector size and, hence, their capacity.

The TPES and TPEES were synthesized by catalyzed two-step transesterification from dimethyl terephthalate, (DMT), 1, 4 -butanediol, (BD) and a siloxane-prepolymer. Incorporation of dicarboxypropyl- or disilanol-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) s (PDMS) into the polar poly(butylene terephthalate) chains resulted in rather inhomogeneous TPES copolymers, {{which was a}} consequence of a prononuced phase separation of the polar and non-polar reactants during synthesis.

30|$|Recall {{that the}} {{definition}} of CNMZK requires {{the existence of a}} simulator-extractor SE that can simulate the view of a man-in-the-middle adversary A while extracting a witness in every accepted right session. Below, we sketch how to build a simulator-extractor. First, we construct a PPT <b>simulator</b> <b>S</b> that simulates the view of A but does not extract witnesses in the right seasons. Then, we construct a PPT simulator-extractor SE via the intermediate <b>simulator</b> <b>S,</b> which can simulate the view of A and extract the witnesses by the committed value oracle. <b>Simulator</b> <b>S</b> On a high level, S internally invokes A and interacts with A as honest prover and honest verifier in the following way. To simulate the view of each session in the right interactions, S simply follows the honest verifier strategy. To simulate the view of each session in the left interactions, S uses the description of the adversary A as the fake witness and reused the previous generated P-certificates if necessary in a straight-line manner. The formal description of this process will be given below. Finally, S outputs the view of the adversary A. Simulator SE On a high level, SE simulates the view of A by executing S as the first part of its output. For each i∈[m], if the i-th right session is accepted and id_i is different from idj for all j∈[m], SE extracts a witness from the session i by oracle access to the one-session committed-value oracleO_cca of CCACom 1 : 1.|$|R
