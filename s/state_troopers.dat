5|$|In the mid-1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) {{increased}} {{its efforts to}} train storm spotters to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and flash flooding. The program was called Skywarn, and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, <b>state</b> <b>troopers,</b> firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, civil defense (now emergency management) spotters, storm chasers, and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.|$|E

5|$|At 10:30 PM, all {{westbound}} Interstate 78 {{traffic is}} {{stopped at the}} Hamburg exit due to numerous disabled vehicles. At 10:40 PM, Governor Ed Rendell declared a disaster emergency.

5|$|In April 1931, Siamese King Prajadhipok and Queen Rambai Barni {{traveled}} from Bangkok to Ophir Hall (currently Reid Hall of Manhattanville College). The couple had flown from Japan to Vancouver {{and took a}} train to Chicago. From Chicago, they took another train, departing at 10:30a.m. on the 21st and arriving at noon on the 22nd, and the trip took 25 hours; the king had requested the train travel slowly, as he was recovering from bronchitis and malaria. The train arrived at the Scarborough station, where journalists, spectators, and video and still photographers met them, along with one of their hosts; they were later driven across the county to stay at Ophir Hall for about six weeks {{in order for a}} cataract operation could be performed by a New York doctor on the king's left eye. <b>State</b> <b>troopers</b> and a squad of New York Central policemen were stationed at Scarborough to ensure a smooth transfer. At the time, the king was an absolute monarch; he later became the country's first constitutional monarch.|$|E
5|$|One {{accident}} at the Mousetrap, a complex interchange, had national ramifications. On August 1, 1984, a truck carrying six torpedoes for the U.S. Navy overturned. The situation was made worse {{as no one}} answered at the phone number provided with the cargo, and an unknown liquid was leaking {{from one of the}} torpedoes. It took more than three hours before any military personnel arrived on the scene, U.S. Army personnel from a nearby base. The incident left thousands of cars stranded and Denver's transportation network paralyzed for about eight hours. Approximately 50 residents in the area were evacuated. Investigations later revealed that the truck driver did not follow a recommended route provided by <b>state</b> <b>troopers,</b> who specifically warned the driver to avoid the Mousetrap. The Navy promised reforms after being criticized for providing an unstaffed phone number with a hazardous cargo shipment, a violation of federal law, and failing to notify Denver officials about the shipment. The Mousetrap was grandfathered into the Interstate Highway system, with some structures built in 1951. The incident provided momentum to rebuild the interchange with a more modern and safer design. Construction began in several phases in 1987 and the last bridge was dedicated in 2003.|$|E
