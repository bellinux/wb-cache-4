After the streaked plant has stood sufficiently long to permit secondary growth to occur, a systemic diseased expression develops {{in a few}} of the plants. No reference to a similar development on Dature meteloides following inoculation with the tobacco mosaic virus was found in the literature. The tomato mosaic virus is thought to be the same as the Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s tobacco mosaic virus No. 1. The virus obtained from the tissue of Dature meteloides exhibiting the systemic infection produces symptoms which cannot be distinguished from the symptoms of the Utah tomato mosaic or the tobacco mosaic virus No. 1 on the tomato. This same virus can be transferred through several generations of tomato and back to Dature meteloides without loosing its identity. These observations led to the questions: Is the tomato mosaic virus the same as the tobacco mosaic virus? Does the tomato mosaic virus change on dature meteloides to produce the <b>systemic</b> <b>virus</b> or is the <b>systemic</b> <b>virus</b> one of a complex of viruses existing on the tomato in the West?

40|$|Background. Current {{oseltamivir}} prophylactic regimensmay not be {{as effective}} against highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 influenza viruses as they are against less pathogenic strains. An optimal regimen is urgently needed. Methods. Ferrets were given the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir orally for 10 days (5 or 10 mg/kg once daily or 2. 5 or 5 mg/kg twice daily). Prophylaxis was initiated 1 day before infection, and oseltamivir was given 4 h before the ferrets were inoculated with a lethal dose of A/Vietnam/ 1203 / 04 (H 5 N 1) influenza virus. Results. At a dose of 5 mg/kg once daily, oseltamivir prevented death but not clinical signs of infection in ferrets; severe pathology was observed in the lungs, brain, and liver. At 10 mg/kg once daily, oseltamivir reduced clinical symptoms and <b>systemic</b> <b>virus</b> replication, but pathology was observed in the internal organs. The best results were obtained at a dose of 2. 5 or 5 mg/kg given twice daily. Both regimens resulted in 100 % survival {{and the absence of}} clinical symptoms, <b>systemic</b> <b>virus</b> spread, and organ pathology. Serum antibody titers were comparable across regi-mens and were sufficient to protect against rechallenge. Conclusions. An increased dose of oseltamivir or twice-daily administration effectively protects ferrets against morbidity and mortality caused by H 5 N 1 infection and does not interfere with the development of protective anti-bodies against subsequent H 5 N 1 infection.

However, the kinetics and pathways of the dissemination have not been well characterised during the first 24 [*]h after the infusion is started. To this end, we infused adenoviral vectors for luciferase or enhanced green fluorescence protein into three different tumour models in mice. During and/or after the infusion, we determined the amount of adenoviruses in the tumour, blood, and liver, and examined the transgene expression in the liver, lung, blood, and tumour. In addition, we intravenously injected tumour cells expressing luciferase and examined the biodistribution of these cells in the body. We observed transgene expression in the liver and tumour at 24 [*]h after the infusion, but could not detect transgene expression in the blood and lung. The peak concentration of viral vectors in the plasma occurred during the intratumoral infusion. At 10 [*]min after the infusion, few viral vectors remained in the blood and the ratio of copy numbers of adenoviruses between liver and tumour was > 2 in 80 % and ⩾ 10 in 40 % of the mice.

30|$|It is {{suggested}} that lung homeostasis is lost when the innate immune system reached {{a high level of}} activation but was unable to contain the pathogen before viral cytopathicity (Boon et al. 2011; Sanders et al. 2011). The depletion of innate immune cell types lowered inflammatory cytokine levels in mouse lung homogenates but resulted in elevated lung viral titers, <b>systemic</b> <b>virus</b> spread, and reduced survival (Tumpey et al. 2005). Mice with decreased myeloid infiltrates and lack of NLRP 3 inflammasome activation exhibited high susceptibility to influenza infection (Allen et al. 2009; Thomas et al. 2009). Selective neutrophil targeting in infected mice caused enhanced mortality (Tate et al. 2009). Therefore, innate inflammatory cells have host-beneficial functions rather than a primary causal role in pathology (Brincks et al. 2008; Tate et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|Quiescent {{long-term}} hematopoietic {{stem cells}} (LT-HSCs) are efficiently activated by type I interferon (IFN-I). However, this effect remains poorly investigated {{in the context}} of IFN-I-inducing virus infections. Here we report that both vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection induce LT-HSC activation that substantially differs from the effects triggered upon injection of synthetic IFN-I-inducing agents. In both infections, inflammatory responses had to exceed local thresholds within the bone marrow to confer LT-HSC cell cycle entry, and IFN-I receptor triggering was not critical for this activation. After resolution of acute MCMV infection, LT-HSCs returned to phenotypic quiescence. However, non-acute MCMV infection induced a sustained inflammatory milieu within the bone marrow that was associated with long-lasting impairment of LT-HSC function. In conclusion, our results show that <b>systemic</b> <b>virus</b> infections fundamentally affect LT-HSCs and that also non-acute inflammatory stimuli in bone marrow donors can affect the reconstitution potential of bone marrow transplants...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a subunit vaccine for smallpox represents a potential strategy to avoid the safety concerns associated with replication-competent vaccinia virus. Preclinical studies to date with subunit smallpox vaccine candidates, however, have been limited by incomplete information regarding protective antigens and the requirement for multiple boost immunizations to afford protective immunity. Here we explore the protective efficacy of replication-incompetent, recombinant adenovirus serotype 35 (rAd 35) vectors expressing the vaccinia virus intracellular mature virion (IMV) antigens A 27 L and L 1 R and extracellular enveloped virion (EEV) antigens A 33 R and B 5 R in a murine vaccinia virus challenge model. A single immunization with the rAd 35 -L 1 R vector effectively protected mice against a lethal <b>systemic</b> vaccinia <b>virus</b> challenge. The rAd 35 -L 1 R vector also proved more efficacious than the combination of four rAd 35 vectors expressing A 27 L, L 1 R, A 33 R, and B 5 R. Moreover, serum containing L 1 R-specific neutralizing antibodies afforded postexposure prophylaxis after <b>systemic</b> vaccinia <b>virus</b> infection. In contrast, the combination of rAd 35 -L 1 R and rAd 35 -B 5 R vectors was required to protect mice against a lethal intranasal vaccinia virus challenge, suggesting that both IMV- and EEV-specific immune responses are important following intranasal infection. Taken together, these data demonstrate that different protective antigens are required based on the route of vaccinia virus challenge.

40|$|Abstract: Many {{patients}} {{suffering from}} angina pectoris {{are treated with}} percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and quickly develop angiographic renarrowing, or restenosis, {{at the site of}} PCI treatment. Restenosis is thought to arise from the combinatorial activation of thrombotic and inflammatory responses. The inflammatory response responsible for restenosis is also thought to involve the activation of a cascade of serine proteases and its subsequent regulation. Poxviruses are known to possess a variety of immunomodulatory strategies, some of which target serine proteases, cytokines, and chemokines. To this end we evaluated whether <b>systemic</b> species-specific swinepox <b>virus</b> (SPV) infection could induce sufficient host-immune modulation to promote an anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effect, thereby preventing restenosis. Two groups of domestic feeder pigs were used- the first group was experimentally infected with SPV (n = 11) and the second group served as an uninfected control (n = 5). A week after infection, the pigs were anesthetized and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was performed in the left anterior descending coronary artery using X-ray fluoroscopy to visualize the balloon and record angiograms. Three weeks post infection, the pigs were euthanized and balloon angioplasty injured arteries were harvested and examined. We observed a statistically significant reduction of restenosis in SPV-infected pigs (p = 0. 05) compared to control pigs and conclude that <b>systemic</b> swinepox <b>virus</b> infection causes sufficient host immune suppression to significantly reduce restenosis in pigs after balloo...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of viruses and gene therapy vectors {{is difficult to}} assess in a living organism. For instance, trafficking in murine models can usually only be assessed after sacrificing the animal for tissue sectioning or extraction. These assays are laborious requiring whole animal sectioning to ascertain tissue localization. They also obviate the ability to perform longitudinal or kinetic studies in one animal. To track viruses after systemic infection, we have labeled adenoviruses with a near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore and imaged these after intravenous injection in mice.

In this report, individual plants were produced and cloned after a tissue culture period of almost a year. Since Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of engineered nucleases produces NHEJ-based mutagenesis only in transfected cells, isolation of transfected cells and their regeneration is an unavoidable step in the cloning of engineered plants [73]. As another approach, systemic infection with a virus harboring genome editing vectors, which would not require regeneration from mutated cells if genome editing occurred in shoot apical meristems, was proposed by Peer et al.

Wide spectrums of clinical syndromes are associated with cytomegalovirus disease. Unique clinical syndromes may present in neonates, young adults and immunocompromised hosts infected with cytomegalovirus. Cases of fulminant hepatitis have been reported in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts infected with Epstein Barr virus. Occasionally, these patients with acute hepatic failure may need liver transplantation. Herpes simplex viruses may involve the liver in neonatal infections, pregnancy, immunocompromised hosts and occasionally, immunocompetent adults. Varicella-Zoster virus has also been associated with severe acute hepatitis and fulminant hepatitis in adults. The drug of choice for these conditions is intravenous acyclovir. These may also need liver transplantation in the more severe forms of clinical presentation. Typical liver biopsy findings can be useful in determining the diagnosis of these viral infections. Human herpesviruses 6, 7, and 8, human parvovirus B 19, and adenoviruses can also be present with features of acute liver injury and occasionally as fulminant hepatitis.
