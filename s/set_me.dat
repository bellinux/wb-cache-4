500|$|... "À Tout le Monde (<b>Set</b> <b>Me</b> Free)", is {{a remake}} of [...] "A Tout le Monde" [...] which {{originally}} appeared on the 1994 album Youthanasia. The song is a more uptempo version of the original song, and features Lacuna Coil vocalist Cristina Scabbia singing backing vocals. Scabbia stated she was [...] "really surprised about it because 'A Tout le Monde' is a song that I've always loved. It was a big surprise {{for me to get}} this invitation—I was really honored to be part of it." [...] Mustaine chose Scabbia over three other choices because of her [...] "reign in the heavy metal business". Mustaine later stated that he originally intended for the song to be a B-side for Japan, but the president of Roadrunner Records (Megadeth's label for this release) wanted [...] "À Tout le Monde (<b>Set</b> <b>Me</b> Free)" [...] released as the album's first single.|$|E
500|$|Three singles were {{released}} from Youthanasia: [...] "Reckoning Day", [...] "Train of Consequences" [...] and [...] "A Tout le Monde".

500|$|The second segment parodies Moses who, {{according}} to the Book of Exodus, freed the Israelites from the Egyptian Pharaoh. Milhouse has the role of Moses while Skinner has {{the role of the}} Pharaoh. When the Pharaoh asked who vandalized his sarcophagus, the burning bush tells him that Bart did it. When Bart is seized by the Pharaoh's guards, he exclaims [...] "No, the bush <b>set</b> <b>me</b> up!" [...] Bart's line refers to the 1990 arrest of Marion Barry who, while being arrested by the FBI for smoking crack cocaine, exclaimed [...] "No, the bitch <b>set</b> <b>me</b> up!" [...] In a scene in the segment, Milhouse and Lisa can be seen pouring frogs into Skinner's tent. The scene refers to the second of ten Biblical plagues that were imposed on Egypt by Yahweh, in chapters 7-12 of the Book of Exodus. While they are inside the torture chamber, Milhouse and Lisa walk past an orb. The orb is called [...] "Orb of Isis" [...] and played a big part in the season 9 episode [...] "Lost Our Lisa". In another scene, Milhouse parts the Red Sea so that his fellow slaves can escape. The execution of the scene is based on the one seen in the 1956 American epic film The Ten Commandments, in which Moses parts the Red Sea. The shot in which Pharaoh and his guards are drowning is also taken from the movie.|$|E

[...] United Abominations was the band's first album to feature Glen Drover, Shawn Drover, and James Lomenzo. It also has a newer version of [...] "À Tout le Monde" [...] entitled [...] "À Tout le Monde (<b>Set</b> <b>Me</b> Free)".

Newcastle turned full-time the following year, and McBreen played 13 matches and scored three goals with Newcastle improving their league position by ranking second in the 2001–02 National Soccer League table. Despite playing less frequently he enjoyed working under new coach Ian Crook, saying [...] "you can speak to him as a human being and he can man manage. He made training enjoyable".|$|E

The album was expected to be finished by summer of 2012 and released by the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013. While Alice in Chains were writing for the album in 2011, Cantrell required surgery, which delayed recording the new material. In an interview published in May 2012, Cantrell explained, [...] "The thing that <b>set</b> <b>me</b> back is I had some bone spurs [...] cartilage issues in my shoulders. I had the same issue in the other shoulder about six years ago so I've had them both done now. It's a repetitive motion injury from playing." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] is a {{moderate}} R, soul and quiet storm ballad pacing in medium time. It {{was written in}} the key of F major, and moves at {{a moderate}} tempo set at 100 beats per minute. Vocal elements of the song range from E3 to D5. [...] "Dangerously in Love" [...] is backed by piano and thumping drum instrumentation. Many music critics noted it to be musically similar to the original Destiny's child version. Lyrically, the song is about being romantically obsessed, as indicated in the chorus: [...] "I am in love with you / You <b>set</b> <b>me</b> free / I can't do this thing called life without you here with me". According to Lisa Verrico of The Times, [...] "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] bears resemblance to Janet Jacksons work if viewed from a [...] "flirty" [...] perspective.|$|E
