This observation could be {{explained by the fact that}} extended <b>shallow</b> planar <b>soil</b> slides are clearly a much larger phenomenon than the fewer embankment slips defined as embankment <b>shallow</b> planar <b>soil</b> slide or <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> slip and involve greater quantities of soil material. Moreover, 16 cases of significant gully erosion were detected and involved lower quantities of soil material. Nevertheless, regarding the damaged areas, embankment <b>shallow</b> planar <b>soil</b> slide or <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> slip are clearly responsible for most of the road maintenance needed and also represent a large part of agriculture land losses, especially in terraces subject to failure processes but also due to land down-slope buried by deposits.

500|$|Water {{diverted}} at O'Shaughnessy Dam feeds {{into the}} Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct, which provides 85 {{percent of the}} municipal water for 2.4 {{million people in the}} San Francisco Bay Area. The firm water yield is [...] per year, or 237 million gallons (895,000 m3) per day. Because of the unique geology of the Hetch Hetchy watershed, which consists of <b>shallow</b> <b>soils</b> underlain by solid granite bedrock, water that flows into the reservoir is exceptionally clear and of very high quality. This quality is further maintained by stringent protection of the watershed; boating and swimming are prohibited at Hetch Hetchy Reservoir (although fishing is permitted at the reservoir and in the rivers which feed it). As a result, San Francisco tap water is some of the cleanest in the United States, without even the need for filtration, and is said to be of better quality than most bottled water.|$|E

40|$|The niche {{differentiation}} of resources among coexisting plants commonly reflects the fundamental functions of plant coexistence in water-limited ecosystems. However, {{the dynamics of}} water use patterns by coexisting plants that respond to soil moisture pulses are scarcely known in the semiarid alpine ecosystems of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, particularly for deep-rooted grasses such as Achnatherum splendens in the Qinghai Lake watershed. Hence, we used the stable deuterium isotope method to detect the potential water sources for A. splendens during two growing seasons of 2013 and 2014. Our results indicate that SWC and delta D values of <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> layer (0 - 10 cm) showed the highest variations in comparison with those in other soil layers during the growing seasons due to the combined effect of evaporation and precipitation inputs. A. splendens depended largely on <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> water availability at the early growing season. At {{the peak of the}} growing season, this deep-rooted grass A. splendens and shallow-rooted grass Leymus chinensis showed a high degree of response in the water use source to the changes in soil moisture pulses and shifted their water source from <b>shallow</b> to deep <b>soil</b> layer because water in the <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> layer became less available due to a long-time rainless days with strong evaporation effect on the <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> layer. In contrast, <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> water was utilized by all coexisting plants owing to an abrupt increase in shallow SWC with large events or long-lasting small events. At the late growing season, A. splendens used water from the shallow (0 - 10 cm) and middle soil layer (10 - 30 cm), while L. chinensis mainly relied on the <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> layer water. Comparatively, shallow-rooted herbs (Heteropappus altaicus and Allium tanguticum) predominantly used water from the <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> layer (0 - 10 cm) over the entire growing seasons regardless of soil water availability. Overall, the contrasting water use patterns by coexisting plants demonstrate their adaptations to the fluctuations of soil moisture pulses in water-limited ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|A general {{paradigm}} in semi-arid and arid systems is that woody plants with dimorphic root systems will exhibit preferential use of deeper soil water because {{it represents a}} more stable source of water than short duration pulses of <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> moisture derived from summer rainfall. However, whether this holds across all woody species and whether use of deeper soil water interacts with use of <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> water is not determined for many species in different ecosystems. Understanding {{the amount of water}} plants derive from groundwater and <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> water is critically important to accurate calculations of local and regional water balance. The focus of this research was to determine if dominant woody species in semi-arid riparian ecosystems used <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> water and how depth to groundwater and defoliation might affect root proliferation and water uptake. This research found that the functional grouping "phreatophytes" encompasses a variety of responses to environmental variation. Stable isotopic analyses determined that Prosopis velutina Woot. (Velvet mesquite) and Populus fremontii Wats. (Fremont cottonwood) used <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> water derived from summer rainfall, and the proportion of <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> water was higher at sites with greater depth to groundwater. In contrast Salix gooddingii Ball (Goodding willow) did not use <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> water at any location regardless of depth to groundwater. Field experiments using defoliation treatments, to limit carbon assimilation and reduce plant photosynthate pools, confirmed that Prosopis velutina exhibited flexible response in water uptake patterns in response to defoliation. Defoliation, which presumably reduced available photosynthate, increased the reliance of this species on <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> water; contrary to predictions that woody species should maintain extensive deep root systems to buffer themselves from seasonal drought. Greenhouse experiments with Populus fremontii and Prosopis velutina also indicated changes in belowground biomass of fine roots, which were associated with changes in water-source use for Populus fremontii, but not for Prosopis velutina. These results imply that in terms of predicting plant response to changes in future climates, or modeling fluxes of water from the soil to the atmosphere that are largely controlled by plant transpiration, intra- and interspecific variability will need to be considered...|$|R

In San Pedro Town, about 90% of structures were destroyed. Newtown was completely demolished, causing its resident to establish the city of Hopkins further south. At Ambergris Caye, many houses and coconut plantations were damaged or destroyed. This forced many laborers and coconut plantation owners to seek new professions; most of them entered the fishing industry. Nine deaths were reported, though the toll may have been higher, as numerous small fishing boats were beached or swept out to sea. Widespread damage to vegetation and trees occurred. An assessment of damage after the storm indicated that more than 75% of the canopy species had been destroyed. Although the low bush was not badly damaged, about 25% to 50% of the pine trees were toppled. Damage on deep soils was largely from breakage while on <b>shallow</b> <b>soils</b> mostly from wind throw. Tides along the coast split Caye Caulker into three separate islands and swept away [...] "everything in its path". Overall, damage totaled approximately $4million, with $1million to private and public property, including buildings and dwellings.

2500|$|The Umatilla Plateau ecoregion, {{named for}} the Umatilla who {{originally}} inhabited the area, {{is characterized by a}} nearly level to rolling, treeless plateau, underlain by basalt and veneered with loess deposits. Elevation varies from 1,000to3,200feet (300to980m). Glacial features such as patterned ground are common. Areas with thick loess deposits are farmed for dryland winter wheat or irrigated alfalfa and barley. Rangeland dominates more rugged areas where loess deposits are thinner or nonexistent. Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 15inches (230 to 380mm) and increases with elevation.

40|$|Uneven {{soil depth}} and low water {{availability}} {{are the key}} limiting factors to vegetation restoration and reconstruction in limestone soils such as in vulnerable karst regions. Belowground competition will possibly increase under limited soil resources. Here, we investigate whether low resource availability (including <b>shallow</b> <b>soil,</b> low water availability, and <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> and low water availability combined) stimulates the competition between grasses with different root systems in karst soil, by assessing their growth response, biomass allocation, and morphological plasticity. In a full three-way factorial blocked design of soil depth by water availability by neighbor identity, we grew Festuca arundinacea (deep-rooted) and Lolium perenne (shallow-rooted) under normal versus <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> depth, high versus low water availability, and in monoculture (conspecific neighbor) versus mixture (neighbor of the other species). The key results were as follows: (1) total biomass and aboveground biomass in either of the species decreased with reduction of resources but were not affected by planting patterns (monoculture or mixture) even at low resource levels. (2) For F. arundinacea, root biomass, root mass fraction, total root length, and root volume were higher in mixture than in monoculture at high resource level (consistent with resource use complementarity), but lower in mixture than in monoculture at low resource levels (consistent with interspecific competition). In contrast for L. perenne, either at high or low resource level, these root traits had mostly similar values at both planting patterns. These results suggest that deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plant species can coexist in karst regions under current climatic regimes. Declining resources, due to <b>shallow</b> <b>soil,</b> a decrease in precipitation, or combined <b>shallow</b> <b>soil</b> and karst drought, increased the root competition between plants of deep-rooted and shallow-rooted species. The root systems of deep-rooted plants may be too small to get sufficient water and nutrients from dry, <b>shallow</b> <b>soil,</b> while shallow-rooted plants will maintain a dominant position with their already adaptive strategy in respect of root biomass allocation and root growth...|$|R
