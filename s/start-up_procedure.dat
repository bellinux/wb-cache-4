An investigation of the emulsion polymerisation of styrene in an isothermal continuous flow stirred reactor has been carried out. The important phenomena of sustainable oscillations and large conversion overshoot after start-up have been studied. Experimental {{studies have shown that}} conversion, number of polymer particles, molecular weights, and all other related properties often oscillate widely with time, and a steady state was not always achieved. The effect of <b>start-up</b> <b>procedures</b> in continuous emulsion polymerisation reactors have not previously beer. investigated in detail. Different <b>start-up</b> <b>procedures</b> were studied to determine their effect on the behaviour of the reactor. The effects of the initial concentration of soap and initiator, and the initial reaction temperatures have been studied experimentally in relation to the mean residence time of the reactor. Changes in <b>start-up</b> <b>procedures</b> were found to have a significant effect not only on the transients before a steady state, but also on the ultimate state achieved. Evidence was obtained supporting the theory that monomer droplets can be a locus of initiation and propagation in emulsion polymerisation of styrene in a CFSR at high level of conversion. Two possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain the phenomena of the high levels of conversion in the CFSR. Special reactor design was used to minimize aeration and to allow the variation of the average residence time without varying the pump settings...|$|R

5000|$|Nevertheless, the {{start-up}} process commenced with the Night Lead Operator on the March 22 {{with the initial}} filling of the splitter tower. The level transmitter was designed to indicate the raffinate level within a 5 ft span {{from the bottom of}} the splitter tower to a 9 ft level, i.e., 72% level indication would be 7.6 ft from the bottom, but it was common practice to fill up to an indicated level of 99%, even though the procedural requirement was stated as 50%. The Day Supervisor arrived late for work and did not have a hand-over with the night shift. During the morning meeting on March 23, it was discussed that the heavy raffinate storage tanks were nearly full and, therefore, the second Day Supervisor was told that the <b>start-up</b> <b>procedure</b> should not continue, but this information was not passed on. The <b>start-up</b> <b>procedure</b> resumed just before 9:30 a.m. under instructions from the other Day Supervisor. Before recommencing the tower refill and circulation process, heavy raffinate was drained {{from the bottom of the}} tower via the level control valve into the heavy storage tank and was then shut off in [...] "manual" [...] mode and not the required [...] "automatic" [...] mode, with a 50% flow rate. The circulation process was restarted just before 10 a.m. and raffinate was once again fed into the tower, even though the level was already too high. Since the level control valve was shut and, therefore, there was no circulation out of the tower, i.e. no heavy raffinate being transferred to the storage tank, the splitter tower inevitably began to fill up. The defective level transmitter continued to show the level at less than 100%, and since the external sight glass was opaque, a visual check to verify the level in the splitter tower was not possible.|$|E
50|$|Recognising {{that the}} pumping station might quickly deteriorate, {{once it was}} no longer used, the Papplewick Pumping Station Trust was formed in 1974, and {{negotiated}} with Nottingham City Council. They obtained a lease which enabled them to open the site as a static museum. Once volunteers started to maintain the site, the idea of steaming the engines was voiced, and a second organisation, the Papplewick Association, was created, with responsibility for operating the machinery. One boiler was certified to be safe in 1975, and work started on refurbishing it. The cooling pond was dry and had to be cleared of leaves and pine needles before refilling could begin on 12 July. There were problems with draughting, and a fan was fitted into the flue. The boiler was lit on 18 September, and this time there were problems with smoke filling the smithy, which required further minor modifications. Steam was raised on 20 September, and the first attempt to run one engine was made the following day, with John Thorlby, who had been superintendent of the pumping station until his retirement, demonstrating the <b>start-up</b> <b>procedure.</b> The boiler feed-pump glands had to be repacked, and the camshaft had to be stripped down to clear the oil ways, but after attention to these items, the engine ran satisfactorily.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{concentrated}} solar power (CSP) plants, parabolic trough systems with thermal oil as heat transfer fluid represent the technically and economically most mature technology. Due to storage systems these plants produce electricity on demand. However, a considerable portion of the annually collected thermal energy is consumed for the <b>start-up</b> <b>procedure.</b> In fact, after shut-down periods thermal masses must be reheated and additionally further energy losses due to imperfect start-up procedures occur.

40|$|Starting up a fan or modifying its {{setting point}} either by {{rotational}} speed variations or blade angle changes, obviously results in new ventilation {{conditions in the}} network, which is, of course, {{the object of the}} operation. However, since transient phenomena may then occur, particularly in complex networks, there may be a need to simulate these situations prior to any action. This is all the more true, if we are dealing with a multiple interactive fan system. Simulations with a transient model have shown that the flow in certain airways could be temporarily reversed due to the pressure variations that reach both its ends with a different time lag. This phenomenon may cause dangerous situations to occur in cases of fire or outburst of methane. It is also true that the air flow could be reversed in secondary and less powerful fans, while still rotating in the normal direction. The study and the experimental investigation of the extension of the reverse flow characteristic is therefore justified from two points of view: â¢ a numerical simulation model for transient flow conditions must be capable of handling temporary reversed flows, and thus have appropriate fan characteristic curves available over the entire operating domain; â¢ while operating fans, reversed flows should be avoided or at least reduced. Therefore, the design of <b>start-up</b> <b>procedures</b> or real time control algorithms should take these phenomena into account. A particular interesting application is the operating of two fans in parallel. In order to investigate experimentally the characteristic curves of a fan under reversed flow conditions a small scale model was built. This facility was designed in such a manner {{that it was possible to}} carry out experiments concerning flow reversions and to try out sequential <b>start-up</b> <b>procedures</b> for two fans in parallel...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{proposes a}} <b>start-up</b> <b>procedure</b> for a doubly-fed {{induction}} generator (DFIG) {{driven by a}} wind turbine. In the DFIG topology the stator is connected direct to the grid while the rotor is connected to a back-to-back converter. This structure requires some care during grid synchronization to avoid undesired overloads. The main goal of a <b>start-up</b> <b>procedure</b> {{is to reduce the}} stresses on the electrical and mechanical components during synchronization. In this work, it is achieved by equalization among the induced stator voltage, the voltage over the filter capacitor and the grid voltage. A phase-locked-loop (PLL) computes the grid voltage phase displacement required for the system control orientation and synchronization procedures. Previous to the starting-up, the output currents set-points of the grid-side converter and rotor-side converter are computed in order to produce the same grid voltage over the filter capacitors and on the stator terminals. The whole procedure is summarized in seven different steps: turbine acceleration by the pitch control, DC-link pre-charge; initialization of the filter current controllers; filter synchronization; DC-Link voltage adjust; rotor current controllers' initialization and stator synchronization.

40|$|The {{performance}} of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC) depends on many different aspects: Besides the operating parameters, which influences on performance are mainly understood, {{the history of}} the fuel cell operation has an essential impact. This fact is reflected in the strong increase of the investigations of degradation processes. During long-term operation, the {{performance of}} polymer electrolyte fuel cells shows a continuous descent while the operating conditions remain the same. In an analogous manner, the <b>start-up</b> <b>procedure</b> of fuel cells and the conditioning of their components - especially of the membrane electrode assembly during to the <b>start-up</b> <b>procedure</b> - have also a significant influence on the cell performance, but are frequently neglected in these studies. Therefore, investigations of the <b>start-up</b> <b>procedure,</b> which are comparable to the degradation investigations, are necessary. During the corresponding start-up process the membrane is humidified for enabling a sufficient proton conductivity of the polymer electrolyte. Simultaneously, the first electrochemical operation leads to a closer connection of the different components of the MEA. The DLR has investigated the influence of different start-up procedures on the performance of a PEFC. The MEAs used in these experiments consisted of commercial Nafion membranes and electrodes from ETEK which were pressed together during the assembly of the cells. In this contribution the characterisation of different start-up procedures by in-situ methods like polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (at the end of each <b>start-up</b> <b>procedure)</b> will be presented. By means of these investigations two basic results can be proven: In comparison to a constant current at start-up, sequentially alternating operating points with increasing current densities yield higher performance {{at the end of the}} procedure.
