Every one laughed {{when he or she}} spoke, and every one {{standing}} near joined freely in the conversation and laughed too. Frank was delighted with the display of fruit in the market, which is probably unequaled in the world. Great piles there were of delicious big oranges, green but perfectly sweet, and of equally refreshing little green limes; pineapples and bananas, green, yellow, and red, guava, and custard apples, alligator pears, melons, and <b>sour</b> <b>sops,</b> and many other native fruits.|$|R
50|$|Betawi cuisine uses rice as staples, {{numbers of}} its dishes are {{revolved}} around rice, either steamed, cooked in coconut milk as nasi uduk (coconut rice), or compressed as ketupat sayur or lontong sayur rice cakes in vegetables soup. As a Muslim-majority community, Betawi people favour beef, mutton and goat meat, as they adhere to Islamic halal dietary-law which forbid pork consumption. Fishes are consumed too. Interestingly — for a coastal city — there are hardly any seafood dishes in Betawi cuisine. But {{there are plenty}} of freshwater fish dishes, using local varieties of snakehead fish and carp. Popular Betawi dishes include soto betawi (beef offals in milky broth), sayur asem (sweet and <b>sour</b> vegetable soup), <b>sop</b> iga sapi (beef rib soup) and kerak telor (spiced coconut omelette). Most of Betawi dishes are cooked in deep-fried, stir-fried, barbecued or braised methods, and feature a delicate balance of sweet, sour and salty flavours.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of restructuring technology {{is intended to}} add value for local fruits. Fresh and ripe <b>sour</b> <b>sop</b> fruits are frequently of having defective appearance, irregular shape and size, or showing signs of insect infestation which make the whole fruit is less acceptable by consumers. Previous study has indicated that <b>sour</b> <b>sop</b> fruit can be restructured into a fresh fruit product with acceptable sensory characteristics using calcium alginate gel system. This particular study was intended {{to determine the effect}} of alginate powder particles size and its guluronic/mannuronic proportion on the physical and sensorial properties of restructured <b>sour</b> <b>sop.</b> The restructured fruit product was evaluated based on its gel strength, pH colour, and sensory attributes which include taste, aroma, mouth feel, appearance, and hardness. <b>Sour</b> <b>sop</b> restructured by internal setting with coarse alginate powder (36 mesh) tend to have softer gel compared to the use of fine alginate powder (120 mesh). Different proportion of guluronic/mannuronic in the alginate used for the restructurization resulted in the same gel strength when calcium lactate powder was used. However, the use of encapsulated calcium lactate resulted in stronger gel with alginate containing higher proportion of mannuronic acid. The alginate particle size and proportion of guluronic/mannuronic content showed no significant difference in product colour and sensory attributes evaluated...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sour</b> <b>sop</b> (Annona muricata L.) is an underutilized {{fruit crop}} in some {{countries}} like Sri Lanka although in some other countries like Mexico, Venezuela and Peru, it is being cultivated in at commercial levels and is used to develop comminute products. The awareness on this fruit and its functional properties among Sri Lankan consumers is very low, especially in urban areas, but it grows in several areas up to 460 m elevations. Today studies have been initiated on Soursop as it is found to have medicinal and therapeutic values. A study was carried out to develop Soursop based ice cream for commercial applications. Therefore, a Soursop ripple ice cream was developed, using soursop as a new fruit to the food processing industry {{as well as a}} new choice for consumers. The present study involved the selection of good quality fruits, preparing soursop puree and preserving it and preparing a fruit sauce for the ice cream. Moreover the product was subjected to several sensory evaluations, chemical analyses, microbiological assessments and storage. Significant amount of crude fibre 0. 13 (%w/w) is obtained for the ripple ice cream. This ripple ice cream was successful in acceptability and keeping quality. Good melting quality with acceptable definite melting was obtained for the ice cream. The ice cream satisfied the SLS standards Ice cream (SLS 223 : 1989). This study was expected to popularize the <b>sour</b> <b>sop</b> as a potential ingredient for manufacturing value added products. The fruit content is about 20 % in this ice cream product...|$|E

40|$|For it is a {{climacteric}} fruit <b>sour</b> <b>sop</b> has {{relatively short}} shelf life mainly {{due to the}} loss of firmness caused by maturation thus compromising its expansion into distant markets. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effect of different controlled atmosphere conditions in extending the life of the fruit. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 5 x 3 factorial arrangement with five variations of carbon dioxide (CO 2) under controlled atmosphere storage and three times after leaving the chambers, with five replicates and the experimental plot was composed of two fruits. After fifteen days in a controlled atmosphere and eight days, at room temperature were evaluated: color of skin and pulp, ethylene production, respiration rate, firmness, titratable acidity, pH, soluble solids, starch content, incidence of decay and degeneracy pulp. The greatest pressures of CO 2 committed, fruit quality by accelerating ethylene synthesis favoring the loss of firmness, degradation of chlorophyll compounds of the skin and pulp and reduces the quality after four days of storage at ambient conditions. The lower pressure CO 2 were more efficient for storing and extending the life of the fruit...|$|E
40|$|Brazil is a {{very large}} country with a diverse climate. This fact allows a {{diversity}} of plants to grow ranging from tropical rainforest in the Amazon, passing through Atlantic Forest along the coast, the cerrados (Brazilian savannah) in the Central West region, and semi-arid area in the Northeast. Latitude ranges from 5 º N to 33 º S, with most of this territory in the tropical region. There are enough reasons to plant breeders devoting great amount of their effort to improve plants suitable for warm climates, though. Among fruit crops, results of breeder's work have been noticed in several species, especially on peaches, grapes, citrus, apples, persimmons, figs, pears and others not so common, such as acerola, guava, annonas (<b>sour</b> <b>sop,</b> sugar apple, atemoya, cherimoya) and passion fruit. Peach tree introduced at low latitude (22 ± 2 ºS) requires climatic adaptation to subtropical conditions of low chilling. In Brazil, the first peach breeding program aiming adaptation of cultivars to different habitats was developed by Instituto Agronômico de Campinas (IAC) beginning in the end of the 40 's. Apple low chill requirement cultivars obtained in a South state, Paraná, are now been planted at low latitudes. Banana and pineapple breeding programs from Embrapa units along the country are successfully facing new sanitary problems. Petrolina/Juazeiro, in the Northeastern region (9 ºS), is the main grape exporting region with more than 6, 000 ha. Grape growing in the region is based in the so called "tropical" rootstocks released by IAC, namely: IAC 313 'Tropical', IAC 572 'Jales'. Recently, Embrapa Grape and Wine released tropical grape seedless cultivars that are changing table grape scenario in the country...|$|E
