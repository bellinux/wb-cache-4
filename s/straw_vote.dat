25|$|Unlike the Democratic caucus, the Republican Party {{does not}} use voting rounds or have minimum {{requirements}} for a percent of votes. The Republican version is done with a <b>straw</b> <b>vote</b> of those attending the caucus. This vote is sometimes done by {{a show of hands}} or by dividing themselves into groups according to candidate. However, officially it is done with voters receiving a blank piece of paper with no names on it, and the voter writing a name and placing it in a ballot box.|$|E

5000|$|At {{a meeting}} of the District of Columbia Ward 6 Democrats, the group decided to endorse Barry for reelection. In the <b>straw</b> <b>vote,</b> Barry {{received}} 74 percent, candidate Mattie Taylor received 16 percent, and Gurley received 9 percent. Gurley's campaign chairman, Doug McLellan, called the event a [...] "staged event" [...] and accused Barry's campaign of packing the meeting with his supporters. The president of the group said the <b>straw</b> <b>vote</b> was legitimate because it was publicized widely and that Gurley lost the <b>straw</b> <b>vote</b> because his campaign did not have much visibility around the ward. At meeting of the Ward 4 Democrats, the results of the <b>straw</b> <b>vote</b> were 95 percent for Barry, 4 percent for Taylor, and 1 percent for Gurley.|$|E
50|$|In the Politburo, {{decisions}} are reached through consensus, not through votes. In certain cases, <b>straw</b> <b>votes</b> {{are used to}} see how many members support or oppose a certain case (these <b>straw</b> <b>votes</b> do not necessarily affect the ultimate decision). Every member has the right to participate in the collective discussion. The CPC General Secretary convenes the Politburo and sets the agenda for the meeting. Each Politburo member is told of the agenda beforehand and is delivered briefing materials by the General Secretary on the agenda matters. The first person to speak at the meeting is the member who proposed the agenda. After that, those who know about the subject, or whose work is directly related to it, may speak. Then those who doubt or oppose the agenda proposal speak. Lastly, the General Secretary speaks and usually supports the agenda proposal, as he supported tabling it for discussion in the first place. When the General Secretary is finished speaking, he calls for a vote. If the vote is unanimous or nearly so, it may be accepted; if the vote is nearly unanimous, but members who directly work in the area discussed oppose it, the issue will be postponed. When the Politburo enacts a decision without all the members' agreement, the other members usually try to convince their opponents. In many ways, the CPC Politburo's policy decision-making is very {{similar to that of the}} Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union after Nikita Khrushchev's removal.|$|R

50|$|The {{first known}} {{example of an}} opinion poll was a local straw poll {{conducted}} by The Aru Pennsylvanian in 1824, showing Andrew Jackson leading John Quincy Adams by 335 votes to 169 in the contest for the United States Presidency. Since Jackson won the popular vote in that state and the whole country, such <b>straw</b> <b>votes</b> gradually became more popular, but they remained local, usually citywide phenomena. In 1916, The Literary Digest embarked on a national survey (partly as a circulation-raising exercise) and correctly predicted Woodrow Wilson's election as president. Mailing out millions of postcards and simply counting the returns, The Literary Digest correctly predicted the victories of Warren Harding in 1920, Calvin Coolidge in 1924, Herbert Hoover in 1928, and Franklin Roosevelt in 1932.|$|R

5000|$|A {{straw poll}} or <b>straw</b> <b>vote</b> is an ad-hoc or {{unofficial}} vote. It {{is used to}} show the popular opinion on a certain matter, {{and can be used}} to help politicians know the majority opinion and help them decide what to say in order to gain votes.|$|E

5000|$|As veteran antiwar activists, {{including}} Joan Baez and David Harris, became involved, Harris suggested {{organizing a}} citywide referendum {{on whether the}} Constellation should set sail. This Constellation Vote became a major antiwar campaign over several months {{that led to a}} citywide <b>straw</b> <b>vote</b> in late September 1971 with 54,721 votes counted. Over 82% of voters elected to keep the ship home, including 73% of the military personnel who voted. While not a [...] "real" [...] vote, the impact on public opinion was appreciable. Even an unsympathetic observer deemed the overall effort to stop the Constellation [...] "an impressive campaign", and the commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet was quoted as saying [...] "never was there such a concerted effort to entice American servicemen from their posts." ...|$|E
5000|$|The City of Watts was {{approved}} by voters of the district, {{and it became a}} municipality in May 1907, with J.F. Donahue, who was a driver for the Blue Ribbon beer company, as mayor and Frederick J. Rorke as city clerk. There was, however, no money to run the city because it had become incorporated too late to levy and collect any taxes. A proposed business license fee raised so much objection that the Board of Trustees, or the city council, submitted to the people a <b>straw</b> <b>vote</b> (nonbinding) question about allowing liquor to be sold in the city. A majority of the 250 votes did agree that Watts should allow saloons, or bars, and that the municipality should raise money by taxing them. Rorke said: ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} he {{announced}} his candidacy, Mourdock released a list of 12 Republican state central committee members and 67 GOP county chairs who endorsed him; he soon began gathering tea party support as well.

At a 2011 local tea party convention in Greenfield, Indiana, Mourdock received 96 of the 97 <b>straw</b> poll <b>votes</b> cast. In {{the week before the}} primary, political action groups such as FreedomWorks, the NRA, National Right to Life, and 45 local tea party groups held a get-out-the-vote rally for Mourdock that was attended by 500 tea party members along with Reverend C.L. Bryant and FOX News political commentator Michelle Malkin. Mourdock addressed the rally praising the support he had been given by FreedomWorks and similar groups, and adding that the tea party movement was very much alive [...] "showing up to work for campaigns." ...|$|R
5000|$|When the Security Council met {{to conduct}} its first <b>straw</b> poll, it <b>voted</b> in private, {{as it had}} done in all {{selections}} since 1981. The President of the General Assembly was officially informed that a straw poll had been taken, but {{the results of the}} poll were not disclosed. Lykketoft realized that [...] "the outcome of this and future informal straw polls will not be communicated" [...] and complained that it [...] "does not live up to the expectations of the membershipand the new standard of openness and transparency". All further straw polls were also taken in private.|$|R
5000|$|The {{veto power}} {{can also be}} used to block the {{selection}} of a Secretary-General. However, this is not counted as a veto of a Security Council Resolution, because the Security Council is only issuing a [...] "recommendation" [...] to the General Assembly. Since 1981, no Secretary-General has been formally vetoed, because the Security Council does not vote until they have already agreed on a Secretary-General in a series of <b>straw</b> polls. A <b>vote</b> by a permanent member to [...] "discourage" [...] a candidate is considered equivalent to a veto, and the candidate will withdraw from the race without forcing a formal veto. The formal recommendation of a Secretary-General is approved unanimously by acclamation.|$|R

Also of note, from 1996 through 2012, Ohio has been within 1.85% of the national popular vote result. Due to the Electoral College system, a bellwether of sufficient size is often also a focus of national attention and presidential campaigns as a so-called swing state that can decide the election {{one way or the}} other. As of 2016, Ohio and Florida are seen as the most important swing states and no Republican has won the presidency while losing Ohio and the controversial decision in Bush v. Gore ultimately hinged on a recount of Florida, that - had it gone for Gore - would have swung the Electoral College vote.|$|E

5000|$|Hutchinson {{was called}} before the Massachusetts General Court to explain herself. She sparred {{verbally}} with the magistrates successfully {{on a number}} of issues, but was ultimately undone when she said that she had determined that she would be persecuted when she came to New England. When the magistrates asked her how she had determined this, she responded [...] "by an immediate revelation" [...] i.e. God had spoken to her and told her so. The Puritans generally followed the principle of sola scriptura and believed that God communicated with individuals only through the medium of scripture. As such, for the magistrates of the General Court, who were already suspicious of Hutchinson's orthodoxy, the claim that God was speaking directly to her was the final <b>straw.</b> They therefore <b>voted</b> to banish her from the colony. As a result, in 1638, Hutchinson and several of her followers left the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded the town of Pocasset, which today is Portsmouth, Rhode Island.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} aspects of the papal election process is the means by which the results of a ballot are announced to the world. Once the ballots are counted and bound together, they are burned in a special stove erected in the Sistine Chapel, with the smoke escaping through a small chimney visible from Saint Peter's Square. The ballots from an unsuccessful vote are burned along with a chemical compound to create black smoke, or fumata nera. (Traditionally, wet straw was used to produce the black smoke, but this was not completely reliable. The chemical compound is more reliable than the <b>straw.)</b> When a <b>vote</b> is successful, the ballots are burned alone, sending white smoke (fumata bianca) through the chimney and announcing to the world the election of a new pope. Starting with the Papal conclave, 2005, church bells are also rung as a signal that a new pope has been chosen.|$|R
50|$|During {{the past}} year, {{a group of}} members, Presbyterians for Unity, {{desiring}} to remain within the Presbyterian Church (USA), were against the split and attempted dialog with the church leadership to attempt some form of reconciliation. Two polls were initially taken, the first was an official vote under established Presbyterian church law and the second was an unofficial <b>straw</b> <b>vote</b> to determine the wishes of as many church members as possible. Both of these votes {{indicated that there was}} insufficient percentage of members required to allow an amicable separation under established Church law. Church law does not recognize straw polls. A third vote was taken by followers of ECO under State law as an independent corporation of the State of Pennsylvania. Case law in Pennsylvania in the past has not permitted a Church to be divided under corporate law and this is the basis of one lawsuit. Recent similar court rulings nationally have taken similar positions. Since July 2016, both religious groups comply with a court order to hold separate services within the church property.|$|E
50|$|As a {{participant}} in the San Diego group, I don't understand the exclusion of every group throughout the state preferring a single party payee system to any of the choices offered for discussion. Those running the forum said that this choice had already been rejected by the state and we would not even be allowed to discuss or consider this as an option. The forum almost ended at that point as this is what the citizenry wanted. The groups from Oakland and Humboldt counties were prepared to walk out if some version of a single party system wasn't included in the discussion. Our table was politically diverse in its make up, yet upon a <b>straw</b> <b>vote</b> ten of our twelve preferred some form of Medicare coverage for all. Upon threat of there not being any discussion at all, we were allowed to consider how such a program would differ from the choices on the table, but nothing beyond that would be accepted. I was a little stunned to hear groups of polar political differences in other issues be unified in their support of a health care system similar {{to the rest of the}} world's. Without my notes I can't report accurately on the remainder of the meeting, only that the participants had been muzzled and nobody had a chance to even discuss their opinions.|$|E

Boston was incorporated while the area consisting of Brilliant was not.The town of Boston had its origins sometime {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century. Alfred Wates opened the first store and later as the community grew, an early settler named Lee Beauchamp named it Boston for the city of Boston, Massachusetts, and also because the name tied in somewhat with the pioneer Bostick family who settled in the area about the time of the Civil War.Both Boston and Brilliant owe most of their early development and progress to the mines of the Aldredge and Brilliant Coal Companies. Brilliant began with the opening of coal mines around 1897.Mayor Wood said that the increase in population resulting from the extension of the corporate limits would mean more revenue from state sources as well as other advantages." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{troubles}} at the Park Southern Apartments roiled the November 2014 D.C. mayoral election. Scott, {{a long-time}} supporter of D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray, is a notable power-broker in local D.C. Democratic Party politics. According to article in The Washington Post, Scott secretly withdrew her support for Gray in early 2014 {{after the city}} began investigating tenant complaints at Park Southern Apartments, and switched her support to D.C. City Council member Muriel Bowser. Scott then allegedly declined to mobilize residents of the Park Southern Apartments to vote for Gray at a January 17, 2014, Democratic Party [...] "straw vote" [...] held in city Ward 8 (where the apartment complex is located). Gray subsequently lost the <b>straw</b> <b>vote,</b> and Bowser was catapulted to front-runner status in the Democratic mayoral primary. Bowser then won the D.C. mayoral primary. Scott subsequently accused Gray of targeting her and her nonprofit corporation {{in retaliation for the}} political activity. The Washington Post reported on July 13, 2014 that Bowser had attempted to set up a private meeting between D.C. housing officials and PSNC (Gray ordered his officials to decline attendance); twice demanded to know under what legal authority city officials acted against PSNC; and challenged the city's right to seize PSNC's property {{under the terms of the}} loan default. Michael Kelly, director of the District of Columbia Housing Authority, asked Bowser to schedule council hearings on PSNC's administration of the Park Southern Apartments, but Bowser (as of July 15) had declined to do so. Instead, Bowser asked the city's inspector general to open an investigation. D.C. City Council member David Catania, an Independent candidate for mayor, accused Bowser of improperly intervening in the situation and engaging in ethically questionable conduct. Bowser dismissed Catania's criticism, and has alleged that problems at Park Southern Apartments are not as bad as the tenants and D.C. Housing Authority allege.|$|E
