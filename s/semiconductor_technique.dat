In our framework, data alignment, hierarchically data distribution, communication generation, loop tiling, and loop splitting are employed.

40|$|In {{previous}} paper {{an active}} directional coupler using a triode 1, 2 {{and its use}} in a bidirectional broad band amplifier 3 have been described. It is obvious the importance of investigating how such a device can be realized by using <b>semiconductor</b> <b>technique.</b> The use of transistors in directional couplers makes new problems grow up due to the variability of transistor parameters. In this paper we describe a transistorized directional coupler that exhibits high directivity over a broad band and a tight coupling coefficient. The problems of stability and non-linear distorsion are discussed and overcome by using feedback. Noise problems are also treated. The use of such a coupler in bidirectional amplifiers is also proposed, and, in this use, {{the problem of the}} long term stabilization of the directivity of the active coupler has been overcome by means of a control system using a reference signal. Experimental results concerning directivity and bandwidth confirm the possibility of a pratical use of the proposed amplifier in bidirectional broad band communication systems on a single cable and on the same frequency band...|$|E
30|$|Digital systems {{should provide}} {{services}} {{according to the}} specifications reliably. Impairments of dependability {{are associated with a}} large class of faults, errors and failures. These impairments may be caused by design, produce or rarely operational imperfections and improper use. There are lots of possible circuit failures: single stuck at 0 or 1 faults, delay and synchronization faults, bridging and open faults, in Metal Oxide <b>Semiconductor</b> <b>technique</b> (MOS) these faults consist in transistor stuck on or stuck off in a logical gates [1]. Some faults cannot be logically represented. Other class of faults can be connected with operational timing frequency and they are related to change impedance parameters, but in that case the built-in testing {{is one of the most}} resistant technique because of common silicon space. Faults that are stimulated may manifest itself as an error. For do that the fault have to be stimulated and propagated to one of internal (to memory module of sequential circuit) or external (primary) circuit output. The error, that is accessible from circuit output, is an information on detected fault and indicates that functional specification of circuit is violated. There is therefore a need for hardware testing.|$|E
30|$|In recent years, {{photocatalytic}} {{degradation of}} various kinds of organic–inorganic pollutants using semiconductor powder as a photocatalyst has been extensively studied[1, 2]. Among various oxide semiconductor photocatalysts, TiO 2 was intensively investigated because of its biological and chemical inertness, strong oxidizing power, nontoxicity, and long-term stability[3, 4, 5]. However, the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 (the bandgap is 3.2 eV, {{and it can be}} excited by photons with wavelengths below 387 nm) is limited to irradiation wavelengths in the UV region so that the effective utilization of solar energy is limited to about 3 % to 5 % of the total solar spectrum. Furthermore, the fast recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs hinders the commercialization of this technology[6]. The decomposition of adsorbed organic compound is closely correlated with the density of space charge-separated electron–hole pair on TiO 2. Therefore, it is of great interest to separate the electron–hole pairs effectively to increase the photon efficiencies and develop new visible-light photocatalyst to extend the absorption wavelength range into the visible-light region. In this sense, an interesting approach {{to deal with the issue}} is carried out by coupled <b>semiconductor</b> <b>technique.</b> Recently, there are a number of studies related to the photocatalytic activity of coupled semiconductor photocatalyst such as ZnO/SnO 2 [6], SnO 2 -TiO 2 [7], Au/TiO 2 -CeO 2 [8], and TiO 2 -CdS[9]. The results show that nearly all the composite semiconductors have presented higher photocatalytic activity than single ones. Indeed, this effect could be due to the synergistic effect of the coupled semiconductor photocatalyst. It was also reported that the chromium-doped TiO 2 has been found to exhibit superior photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation because chromium atom can effectively narrow the energy bandgap of TiO 2 [10, 11]. Chromium-based catalysts have been widely examined for polymerization, partial oxidation, and aromatization reaction because of the peculiar characteristics of Cr oxide species on the surface of the support, including oxidation state and coordination environment[12]. However, there have been few studies clearly elucidating the roles of the surface chromate species and supporting the oxidation reaction, particularly the decomposition of environmental pollutants.|$|E
