The point where they eventually met was set as the other extreme of the island, and the subsequently created line was chosen as the frontier, dividing Saint-Martin from <b>Sint</b> <b>Maarten.</b> Seemingly, the French walker had walked more than his Dutch counterpart (they earned their respective lands 54km² and 32km²).
