5|$|After Cnut's {{death in}} 1035 the English throne fell to Harold Harefoot, his <b>son</b> <b>by</b> his first wife, while Harthacnut, his <b>son</b> <b>by</b> Emma, became king in Denmark. England {{remained}} unstable. Alfred returned to England in 1036 {{to visit his}} mother and perhaps to challenge Harold as king. One story implicates Earl Godwin of Wessex in Alfred's subsequent death, but others blame Harold. Emma went into exile in Flanders until Harthacnut became king following Harold's death in 1040, and his half-brother Edward followed Harthacnut to England; Edward was proclaimed king after Harthacnut's death in June 1042.|$|E

5|$|After Elverson's {{death in}} 1911, his <b>son</b> <b>by</b> his wife Sallie Duvall, James Elverson Jr. took charge. Under Elverson Jr., the {{newspaper}} continued to grow, eventually needing to move again. Elverson Jr. bought land at Broad and Callowhill Streets {{and built the}} eighteen-story Elverson Building, {{now known as the}} Inquirer Building. The first Inquirer issue printed at the building came out on July 13, 1925. Elverson Jr. died a few years later in 1929 and his sister, Eleanor Elverson, Mrs. Jules Patenôtre, took over.|$|E

5|$|Consumed with remorse, {{the king}} sought {{to rectify the}} {{situation}} by arranging a marriage between his brother's orphaned son and Andriamanelo's own sister (the orphan's aunt), Rafotsindrindramanjaka. He declared that the child from this union would, if female, be wed to his own son Ralambo; if male, he would become Ralambo's successor. A girl was born, and she was promised to Ralambo as his future wife with the stipulation that the child born of their union would rule after Ralambo. In this way Andriamanelo established a tradition of succession that indirectly respected the queens' decree by ensuring that a child of his brother's line (and his own) would rule after him. Because of this decree, Ralambo's first <b>son</b> <b>by</b> his second wife was passed over {{in the line of}} succession in favor of Andrianjaka, Ralambo's <b>son</b> <b>by</b> Rafotsindrindramanjaka. Andriamanelo was also reportedly the first to formally establish the andriana as a caste of Merina nobles, thereby laying the foundation for a stratified and structured society. From this point forward, the term Hova was used to refer only to the non-noble free people of the society which would later be renamed Merina by Andriamanelo's son Ralambo.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{commissioned}} as a {{pilot officer}} midway through his Korean service, Newham's next posting was with No. 78 (Fighter) Wing on Malta, where he flew de Havilland Vampires until 1955. The wing had been on garrison duty in Malta since July 1952, and Newham was one of five Korean War veterans who replaced pilots posted back to Australia. He married Jo Cranston in 1956; the couple had two daughters and a <b>son.</b> <b>By</b> November 1957, Newham had been promoted to flight lieutenant and was undergoing conversion training on the CAC Sabre.

5|$|He was {{survived by}} his wife and two daughters. Susanna had married a physician, John Hall, in 1607, and Judith had married Thomas Quiney, a vintner, two months before Shakespeare's death. Shakespeare signed his last will and {{testament}} on 25 March 1616; the following day, his new son-in-law, Thomas Quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate <b>son</b> <b>by</b> Margaret Wheeler, who had died during childbirth. Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare family.|$|E

He was succeeded by his son Thorfinn Skull-splitter and during this time the deposed Norwegian King Eric Bloodaxe often used Orkney as a raiding base before being killed in 954. Thorfinn's death and presumed burial at the broch of Hoxa, on South Ronaldsay, led to {{a long period of}} dynastic strife.|$|E

This marriage, and Máel Coluim's raids on northern England, prompted interference by the Norman rulers of England in the Scottish kingdom. King William the Conqueror invaded and Máel Coluim submitted to his authority, giving his oldest son Donnchad as a hostage. From 1079 onwards there were various cross border raids by both parties and Máel Coluim himself and Edward, his eldest <b>son</b> <b>by</b> Margaret, died {{in one of them}} in the Battle of Alnwick, in 1093.|$|E

The archbishop had come to Antioch to secure Raymond-Roupen's right to succeed Bohemond. On Conrad's demand, Bohemond summoned the Antiochene noblemen, who swore fealty to his grandson.|$|E
5|$|The {{experimentation}} {{evident on}} Somewhere in Time continued on their next album, entitled Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which {{was released in}} 1988. A concept album, based on the 1987 novel Seventh <b>Son</b> <b>by</b> Orson Scott Card, {{this would be the}} band's first record to include keyboards, performed by Harris and Smith, as opposed to guitar synthesisers on the previous release. After his contributions were not used for Somewhere in Time, Dickinson's enthusiasm was renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album. Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden's second album to hit No.1 in the UK charts, although it only achieved a Gold certification in the US, in contrast to its four predecessors.|$|E
