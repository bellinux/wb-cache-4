5|$|After Cassini {{became the}} first {{director}} of the Paris Observatory in 1671, he tackled {{the problem of the}} physical scale of the Solar System. The relative size of the planetary orbits was known from Kepler's third law, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> needed was the actual size of one of the planet's orbits. For this purpose, the position of Mars was measured against the background stars from different points on the Earth, thereby measuring the diurnal parallax of the planet. During this year, the planet was moving past the point along its orbit where it was nearest to the Sun (a perihelic opposition), which made this a particularly close approach to the Earth. Cassini and Jean Picard determined the position of Mars from Paris, while the French astronomer Jean Richer made measurements from Cayenne, South America. Although these observations were hampered by the quality of the instruments, the parallax computed by Cassini came within 10% of the correct value. The English astronomer John Flamsteed made comparable measurement attempts and had similar results.|$|E

500|$|So Far, So Good... <b>So</b> <b>What!</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in January 1988 and was well received by fans and critics. The album featured a cover {{version of the}} Sex Pistols' [...] "Anarchy in the U.K."; Mustaine changed the song's lyrics, later {{saying that he had}} simply heard them incorrectly. To support the album, Megadeth embarked on a world tour, opening for Dio in Europe and then joining Iron Maiden's Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour in the United States.|$|E
500|$|With a major-label budget, the Paul Lani-produced So Far, So Good... So What! {{took over}} five months to record. The album was plagued with {{problems}} during production, partially due to Mustaine's struggle with drug addiction. Mustaine later said: [...] "The production of So Far, So Good... <b>So</b> <b>What!</b> <b>was</b> horrible, mostly due to substances and the priorities we had or didn't {{have at the}} time." [...] Mustaine clashed with Lani on several occasions, beginning with Lani's insistence that the drums be recorded separately from the cymbals, an unheard-of process for rock drummers. Mustaine and Lani became estranged during the album's mixing, and Lani was replaced by Michael Wagener, who remixed the album.|$|E

500|$|Mega Man 6 was {{developed}} {{at the same time}} as the franchise's first spin-off, Mega Man X for Nintendo's newer console, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Series artist Keiji Inafune, credited as [...] "Inafking", stated that having a video game franchise with six titles is very rare, and one of the advantages to this is that players expect certain aspects of each game to be repeated in the next. After having implemented so many different mechanics to the gameplay of past entries, Inafune thought that Rush adaptor assembly was inevitable. The artist struggled with the adaptor designs and ultimately found them to be unrealistic. According to Inafune, [...] "If you think about it, they shouldn't be able to combine like this. It would be awkward if parts of Rush like his neck were left over after they combined, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> I supposed to do?" ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{songs from}} So Beautiful or So What were made {{available}} {{in various forms}} before their release on the album. [...] "Rewrite" [...] and [...] "Love and Hard Times" [...] appeared in Simon's 2008 book Lyrics; 1964-2008, [...] "Questions for the Angels" [...] was included on the 2009 Starbucks compilation This Better Be Good, and the lead single [...] "Getting Ready for Christmas Day" [...] premiered on National Public Radio on November 16, 2010. On April 5, 2011, So Beautiful or <b>So</b> <b>What</b> <b>was</b> available for streaming on the album's website {{of the same name}} for the week preceding its official release. It was released on formats including digital download, vinyl LP, and a CD deluxe edition with a DVD featuring footage of Simon's live performances at Webster Hall. Rolling Stone held a sweepstakes for fans to win a collector's edition box set, which was released in a limited amount of 1,000 copies and included the CD/DVD deluxe edition, a vinyl copy, and a 12' x 12' lithograph and replica notebook.|$|E
500|$|By the {{standards}} of the Western front, the gains of the first two days were nothing short of spectacular. A great deal of ground was gained for relatively few casualties and a number of strategically significant points were captured, notably Vimy Ridge. Additionally, the offensive succeeded in drawing German troops away from the French offensive in the Aisne sector. In many respects, the battle might be deemed a victory for the British and their allies but these gains were offset by high casualties and the ultimate failure of the French offensive at the Aisne. By the end of the offensive, the British had suffered more than 150,000 casualties and gained little ground since the first day. Despite significant early gains, they were unable to effect a breakthrough and the situation reverted to stalemate. Although historians generally consider the battle a British victory, in the wider context of the front, it had very little impact on the strategic or tactical situation. Ludendorff later commented [...] "no doubt exceedingly important strategic objects lay behind the British attack but I {{have never been able to}} discover what they were". Ludendorff was also [...] "very depressed; had our principles of defensive tactics proved false and if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> to be done?" ...|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{took note}} of the rather overt {{religious}} symbolism in Simon's lyrics; one Irish blogger facetiously called So Beautiful or So What the year's best Christian music album, while American evangelical journalist Cathleen Falsani {{said it was the}} most significant record of spiritually reflective music in recent years. Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau found Simon's usual folk rock [...] "graced with global colors that sound as natural" [...] as his guitar and said his lyrics are imbued with gratitude for his wife's love and God, although he disagreed with Simon's view of God's benevolent nature. Andy Gill from The Independent was more critical and found Simon's ruminations on love, age, and mortality trivial, while Pitchfork Media critic Stephen M. Deusner said the record [...] "can be stodgy in its emotions and a bit too devoted to its motifs". At the end of 2011, So Beautiful or <b>So</b> <b>What</b> <b>was</b> voted the 14th best album of the year in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it 3rd on his year-end list for The Barnes & Noble Review. Rolling Stone also named it the year's 3rd best record, while Mojo ranked it 15th.|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} So Beautiful or <b>So</b> <b>What</b> <b>was</b> {{inspired}} by West African blues, which Simon combined with [...] "Indian drumming, Old Hollywood strings and bluegrass harmony singing." [...] The songs employ {{a wide variety}} of samples, including from older blues and gospel recordings. [...] "Love Is Eternal Sacred Light" [...] contains a harmonica sample from Sonny Terry, and [...] "Love and Blessings" [...] lifts from The Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet. Simon did not want to record an ordinary studio album and instead, according to Ramone, wanted [...] "lots of space with lots of atmosphere and feeling ... Rather than go for hugely orchestrated ideas he was going, for example, for overtones in bells and gongs. Or if a sax or a kora comes in, they're there to do something specific, and not to fill in the space." [...] The album's music is also largely devoid of heavy bass (some tracks actually using a baritone guitar instead), and drums are very quiet and reserved. Smith said percussion instruments, including exotic bells, ancient hand bells, and glockenspiels, were Simon's favorite to record with for the album. In using bells to augment the sound, Simon put them behind certain guitar notes to “highlight” the sound, as he wanted the recordings to be devoid of echo; he found that using bells created only a slight echo, with an odd, atmospheric tone that he preferred. Drummer Jim Oblon placed towels over each drums to emphasize the higher-frequency percussive instruments.|$|E
