5|$|After {{the rebel}} capture of Brussels on 18 December, work soon began {{on a new}} constitution. In January, the rebels re-called the States-General, a {{traditional}} assembly composed of the provincial elites which had not met since the Middle Ages, to discuss the form the new state would take. Its 53 members, representing the states and social classes, met in Brussels in January 1790 to begin negotiations. The constitution eventually devised by the States-General was inspired by both the Dutch Verlatinge of 1581 and American Declaration of Independence of 1776. The liberals were disgusted that members of society from beyond the guilds, clergy and nobility should not be consulted. They also saw the closed <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> the States-General as ridiculing the idea of popular sovereignty. The declaration of the independence was not supported by Britain and the Dutch who believed that the new independent state {{would not be able}} to act as an effective buffer against possible French territorial expansion in the region.|$|E
5|$|At the beginning, {{there were}} no signs of the quarrels that would destroy the {{military}} committee. At the time, the members were bound together by their goal of building a prosperous nation. On 9 March the NCRC released Lu'ay al-Atassi from jail, promoted him to the rank of lieutenant general, appointed him commander-in-chief and NCRC chairman, the de facto head of state. Hariri was appointed chief of staff. While Atassi and Hariri held powerful posts, they did not possess enough personal or political power to threaten the NCRC. The Nasserist officers were also given notable offices with Muhammad al-Sufi becoming Minister of Defence and Rashid al-Qutayni becoming deputy chief of staff. However, the Military Committee, which had expanded its membership with five new members, ensured that the Ba'athists controlled the real levers of powers. The committee decided state policies before the <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> the NCRC, and by doing so became the real seat of power.|$|E
5|$|Augie March {{returned}} to the studio in 2004 to record a follow-up to Strange Bird. The band worked with two producers, Paul McKercher and Eric Drew Feldman, and recorded in Melbourne, San Francisco, and their own studio in Nagambie, Victoria. Donovan said it was more suited to the band's style; as they co-produced on all their albums, they took {{a great deal of}} interest in production. He said it also enabled them to work at their own pace, hence the four-year gap between releases. They released a DVD, Drones & Vapid Ditties, containing live performances and music videos, in mid-2004. The band's upcoming album, according to Triple J, was inspired by the streets of Melbourne. Upon completion of the initial recording <b>sessions</b> <b>of</b> Moo, You Bloody Choir, there was a six-month delay before release, as Augie March meticulously added finishing touches to it. In March 2006, the album was finally released.|$|E
