5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} is generated within regions of the interior where convective circulation occurs. This movement of conductive plasma functions like a dynamo, wherein the movement of electrical charges induce {{magnetic field}}s, as does a mechanical dynamo. Those magnetic fields have a great range that extend throughout and beyond the star. The strength of the magnetic field varies with the mass and composition of the star, {{and the amount of}} magnetic <b>surface</b> <b>activity</b> depends upon the star's rate of rotation. This <b>surface</b> <b>activity</b> produces starspots, which are regions of strong magnetic fields and lower than normal surface temperatures. Coronal loops are arching magnetic field flux lines that rise from a star's surface into the star's outer atmosphere, its corona. The coronal loops can be seen due to the plasma they conduct along their length. Stellar flares are bursts of high-energy particles that are emitted due to the same magnetic activity.|$|E
5|$|If a star {{displays}} magnetic <b>surface</b> <b>activity</b> such as starspots, {{then these}} features can be tracked {{to estimate the}} rotation rate. However, such features can form at locations other than equator and can migrate across latitudes {{over the course of}} their life span, so differential rotation of a star can produce varying measurements. Stellar magnetic activity is often associated with rapid rotation, so this technique can be used for measurement of such stars. Observation of starspots has shown that these features can actually vary the rotation rate of a star, as the magnetic fields modify the flow of gases in the star.|$|E

25|$|Crystal Cubism was a {{distilled}} form of Cubism {{consistent with}} a shift between 1915 and 1916 towards {{a strong emphasis on}} flat <b>surface</b> <b>activity</b> and large overlapping geometric planes, practised by Braque, Picasso, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, Diego Rivera, Henri Laurens, Jacques Lipchitz, Alexander Archipenko, Fernand Léger and several other artists into the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|ESI has a {{more complex}} {{ionisation}} mechanism, relying heavily on droplet charge excess and as such {{there are many more}} factors to consider when exploring the cause of ion suppression. It has been widely observed that for many analytes, at high concentrations, ESI exhibits a loss of detector response linearity, perhaps due to reduced charge excess caused by analyte saturation at the droplet surface, inhibiting subsequent ejection of gas phase ions from further inside the droplet. Thus competition for space and/or charge may be considered as a source of ion suppression in ESI. Both physical and chemical properties of analytes (e.g. basicity and <b>surface</b> <b>activity)</b> determine their inherent ionisation efficiency. Biological sample matrices naturally tend to contain many endogenous species with high basicity and <b>surface</b> <b>activity,</b> hence the total concentration of these species in the sample will quickly reach levels at which ion suppression should be expected.|$|E

40|$|As {{defined by}} the Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS), the lunar {{architecture}} {{is a combination of}} the lunar “mission mode, ” the assignment of functionality to flight elements, and the definition of the activities to be performed on the lunar surface. The trade space for the lunar “mission mode, ” or approach to performing the crewed lunar missions, was limited to the cislunar space and Earth-orbital staging locations, the lunar <b>surface</b> <b>activities</b> duration and location, and the lunar abort/return strategies. The lunar mission mode analysis is detailed in Section 4. 2, Lunar Mission Mode. <b>Surface</b> <b>activities,</b> including those performed on sortie-and outpost-duration missions, are detailed in Section 4. 3, Lunar <b>Surface</b> <b>Activities,</b> along with a discussion of the deployment of the outpost itself. The mission mode analysis was built around a matrix of lunar- and Earth-staging nodes. Lunar-staging locations initially considered included the Earth-Moon L 1 libration point, Low Lunar Orbit (LLO), and the lunar surface. Earth-orbital staging locations considered included due-east Low Earth Orbits (LEOs), higher-inclination International Space Station (ISS) orbits, and raised apogee High Earth Orbits (HEOs).

25|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>activity</b> {{appears to}} be related to the age and {{rotation}} rate of main-sequence stars. Young stars with a rapid rate of rotation exhibit strong activity. By contrast middle-aged, Sun-like stars with a slow rate of rotation show low levels of activity that varies in cycles. Some older stars display almost no activity, which may mean they have entered a lull that is comparable to the Sun's Maunder minimum. Measurements of the time variation in stellar activity can be useful for determining the differential rotation rates of a star.|$|E

It was inaugurated {{in a great}} celebration by the German emperor, Wilhelm II. Although it did not realize all the hopes astronomers had for it, nevertheless two important discoveries should be mentioned: the interstellar calcium lines in the spectrum of the spectroscopic binary Delta Orionis by Johannes Hartmann in 1904 {{and the presence of}} stellar calcium emission lines — a hint of stellar <b>surface</b> <b>activity</b> — by Gustav Eberhard and Hans Ludendorff about 1900.|$|E
25|$|Femme au miroir (en. Woman with a Mirror), Femme à sa toilette or Lady at her Dressing Table, is a {{painting}} by the French artist Jean Metzinger. This distilled synthetic form of Cubism exemplifies Metzinger's continued interest, in 1916, towards less <b>surface</b> <b>activity,</b> with {{a strong emphasis on}} larger, flatter, overlapping abstract planes. The manifest primacy of the underlying geometric configuration, rooted in the abstract, controls nearly every element of the composition. The role of color remains primordial, but is now restrained within sharp delineated boundaries in comparison with several earlier works. The work of Juan Gris from the summer of 1916 to late 1918 bares much in common with that of Metzinger's late 1915, early 1916 paintings.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} {{modification of}} Cubism between 1914 and 1916 was signaled by a shift towards {{a strong emphasis}} on large overlapping geometric planes and flat <b>surface</b> <b>activity.</b> This grouping of styles of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920, was practiced by several artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector Léonce Rosenberg. The tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the critic Maurice Raynal as 'crystal' Cubism. Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of World War I—such as the fourth dimension, dynamism of modern life, the occult, and Henri Bergson's concept of duration—had now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference.|$|E

In this study, {{we examine the}} sonochemical adsorption of PFOX, where X = S for PFOS and A for PFOA, by determining kinetic order and absolute rates over an initial PFOX concentration range of 20 nM to 200 μM. Sonochemical PFOX kinetics transition from pseudo-first-order at low initial concentrations, [PFOX]_i 40 μM, as the bubble interface sites are saturated. At PFOX concentrations below 100 μM, concentration-dependent rates were modeled with Langmuir−Hinshelwood (LH) kinetics. Empirically determined rate maximums, V_(Max) ^(−PFOA) = 2230 ± 560 nM min^− 1 and V_(Max) ^(−PFOS) = 230 ± 60 nM min^− 1, {{were used in the}} LH model, and sonochemical <b>surface</b> <b>activities</b> were estimated to be K_(Sono) ^(PFOS) = 120000 M^− 1 and K_(Sono) ^(PFOA) = 28500 M^− 1, 60 and 80 times greater than equilibrium <b>surface</b> <b>activities,</b> K_(Eq) ^(PFOS) and K_(Eq) ^(PFOA).
