50|$|Conidia {{produced}} {{under the}} favorable conditions are spread from primary source by wind or rain to infect developing young susceptible twigs, fruits, or leaves of peach plant. Fruit infections take place during early development since conidia begin {{to produce and}} peak around calyx split and bloom. Once conidia are successfully landed on susceptible hosts, they form germ tubes which will become spore bearing conidiophores. This step requires three sequential stages: <b>sporophore</b> production, spore production, and spore maturation. Infection is most severe during spring and winter because further spread of fungi is favored by wet and warm environment.

40|$|The {{changes of}} the {{concentration}} of iron in the growth substrates and the sporophores of Agaricus bisporus (Lange) Pilat that occurred during culture under standard commercial conditions, were observed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry and iron- 59 radiotracing techniques. The routes of translocation and sites of iron accumulation within the <b>sporophore</b> were shovn to alter during development and {{by the use of}} novel, pelletised substrates the concentration of iron in the mycelium of the substrates and in developing sporophores was observed during culture. Findings indicated that the compost was the major source of iron and that the concentration of iron in the compost mycelium varied cyclically in relation to the periodic appearance of sporophores. In the casing layer the mycelium is organised into strands which are responsible for the movement of iron from the compost into developing sporophores. A photographic technique for estimating <b>sporophore</b> growth rates showed that the accumulation of iron was not concomitant with <b>sporophore</b> growth and this was attributable to a declining quantity of available iron in the compost mycelium during <b>sporophore</b> growth. Variations in the quantity of iron in sporophores resulted primarily from differences in the quantity of water soluble iron in the compost but, the productivity of the crop, the type of casing layer and differences in watering also influenced <b>sporophore</b> composition. Changes in the concentration of extractable iron in the compost and casing layer throughout culture were related to mycelial activity {{and to a lesser extent}} were influenced by watering and the bacterial populations of the casing layer. Thus, the findings of this study give some indication of the relative importance that different cultural conditions exert over <b>sporophore</b> composition together with demonstrations of the movement of a single material within the sporophores and substrates during the cultivation of Agaricus bisporus...|$|E
40|$|The enzymic {{oxidation}} of the polyunsaturated fatty acid-linoleic acid leads, in fungi, to {{the formation}} of a unique class of nonconjugated hydroperoxides, which are cleaved to form eight-carbon volatiles characteristic of mushroom and fungal flavor. However, the enzymes involved in this biosynthetic pathway, the bioavailability of the fatty acid substrate, and the occurrence of the reaction products (hydroperoxides and eight-carbon volatiles) are not fully understood. This study investigated the lipids, fatty acids, and hydroperoxide levels, as well as eight-carbon volatile variations in the fungal model Agaricus bisporus, according to four parameters: <b>sporophore</b> development, postharvest storage, tissue type, and damage. Eight-carbon volatiles were measured using solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

40|$|The A. bisporus {{fruit body}} can develop from a 0. 5 cm {{primordium}} to a 7 cm fruit body within 6 days {{and it is}} this rapid growth and expansion which was investigated. The mycelium and fruit body extract water and solutes from the compost and casing soil. Water and solute translocation is thought to occur by osmotically derived pressure driven mass flow whereby the accumulation of the polyol mannitol in the fruit body lowers the water potential and allows for an influx of water which increases the turgor pressure and creates a turgor gradient thus driving water and solutes into the mycelium. This work investigated the mechanism of water and sugar translocation through the mycelium and into the developing <b>sporophore</b> and the factors which affect this translocation path. The effect of different water stresses (osmotic and matric) on mycelial growth, osmotic, turgor and water potential and the accumulation of endogenous sugars and polyols when grown on two different media: a defined malt extract and compost derived was investigated. The concentration of various sugars and polyols was measured in the following <b>sporophore</b> tissue: cap, gills, skin and upper and lower stipe. A sugar transporter gene SUT 1 which had previously been identified in A. bisporus was fully characterised. The mycelium was most sensitive to changes in matric than osmotic potential on malt extract agar (MEA) medium and there was no mycelial growth below - 0. 98 MPa on matrically modified medium but the mycelium continued to grow at water stresses of - 1. 48 and - 2. 48 MPa on osmotically modified MEA medium. However on compost derived medium less difference was found between osmotic and matric stresses. The following sugars: glucose and trehalose and the polyols: mannitol, glycerol and erythritol were quantified in the mycelium and mannitol was found to be the dominant polyol which increased with increasing water stress in the mycelium. However in mycelium grown on matrically modified compost media at - 0. 48 and - 0. 98 MPa the mannitol levels didn’t increase with increasing water stress and this was reflected by the mycelium having a lower internal water potential than the external medium indicating that the mycelial tolerance to matric stresses is linked to the components of the compost as no such tolerance was found on MEA medium. Mannitol was the main polyol detected in all the <b>sporophore</b> tissues but {{there were no significant differences}} between the stages of <b>sporophore</b> development indicating that there was no change in the levels of mannitol. Previous reports by Hammond and Nichols (1976) and Wannet et al. (2000) have shown that the level of mannitol increased during <b>sporophore</b> development but the difference could be attributed to the casing soil which is now wetter and therefore the <b>sporophore</b> is not under increasing water stress and can extract water without having to constantly adjust its polyol concentration. The SUT 1 protein had a predicted molecular weight of 61. 2 kDa and according to topology predictions had 12 transmembrane domains and a number of highly conserved regions which place it in the sugar transporter family of the major facilitator superfamily. The level of SUT 1 transcript increased during <b>sporophore</b> development and there were higher but equal levels of SUT 1 transcript in the upper and lower stipe compared to the cap, gills and skin tissue (indicated by Northern analysis). However no SUT 1 transcript could be detected in the mycelium supporting stage 2 and 4 <b>sporophore</b> development indicating that it is possibly involved in translocation in the fruit body but not in the mycelium. The detection of the SUT 1 protein by Westerns was attempted using an antibody raised to the SUT 1 C-terminal region. However the extraction and solubilisation of the membrane bound SUT 1 protein proved very difficult and was not successfully detected by Westerns.
