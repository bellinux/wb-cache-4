Analytical tools used to find out return rate of investment at capital market (Rm), to find out the expected return rate at capital market E(Rm), to find out <b>investment</b> <b>risk</b> at capital market (σ Rm), also to find out return rate of investment at stock exchange (Rv), to find out the expected return rate at stock exchange E(Rv), to find out <b>investment</b> <b>risk</b> at stock exchange (σ Rv), while to determine the difference of return rate and <b>investment</b> <b>risk</b> between capital market and stock exchange, there used variance analysis (ANOVA). The equation of return rate in capital market (Rm) along the study was 54. 356071, expected return rate in capital market E(Rm) along the study was 0. 092285349, and <b>investment</b> <b>risk</b> at capital market (σ Rm) along the study was 0. 923059898.
