50|$|All {{elements}} {{aside from}} argon, neon, and helium form fluorides by direct reaction with fluorine. Chlorine is slightly more selective, but still reacts with most metals and heavier nonmetals. Following the usual trend, bromine is less reactive and iodine least of all. Of the many reactions possible, illustrative is {{the formation of}} gold(III) chloride by the chlorination of gold. The chlorination of metals is usually not very important industrially since the chlorides are more easily made from the oxides and the hydrogen halide.

40|$|Abstract {{approved}} (Major professor) As part of {{a continuing}} study of sulfur containing non-aqueous solvents, the present investigation was undertaken {{in an effort to}} ob-tain {{a better understanding of the}} solvent sulfuryl chloride. The primary object of the investigation involved a study of the rate of radiochlorine exchange between sulfuryl and thionyl chloride in mix-tures of the two, the radioisotopic tracer chlorine- 36 being used. The principal motivation for such experiments rested in the hope of being able to find some evidence relative to the possible significance of an ionic dissociation process for sulfuryl chloride. The system was of particular interest in presenting analogies to at least two related types of systems previously studied, namely the thionyl chloride- thionyl bromide system (where rapid radiosulfur exchange was observed) and the thionyl chloride- <b>sulfur</b> <b>monochloride</b> syste...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The preparation, by a freeze−thaw method, of new graphite/isobutylene-isoprene rubber (IIR) sorbents for oil {{and organic}} liquid is described. Graphite was {{expected}} to improve the adsorption properties. The cryogels were prepared by solution crosslinking IIR rubber {{in the presence of}} graphite in benzene at various temperatures, using <b>sulfur</b> <b>monochloride</b> as the crosslinker, and characterized by SEM and contact angle measurements. The dried cryogels, with interconnected macropores were sponge-like soft materials, with excellent buoyancy and hydrophobicity. They also showed excellent sorption characteristics, with the best sample exhibiting maximum sorption capacities of 17. 8 g g− 1 for crude oil, 21. 6 g g− 1 for diesel oil, and 23. 4 g g− 1 for lubricating oil, respectively. The samples also showed excellent sorption capability for organic liquids, absorbing up to around twenty times their own mass. After rapid and effective desorption, taking just 3 − 5 h, the cryogels were recovered. They could also be reused more than 30 times by simply centrifuging to remove the sorbed liquid. These characteristics mean that the cryogels prepared in this study are promising materials for removal of large-scale oil or toxic organic spills...|$|E
40|$|Nanostructures and {{properties}} of blends of homopolymer and elastomeric block copolymer nanoparticles were studied {{focusing on the}} effect of morphology and the viscoelastic properties on blends. The cylindrical and lamellar morphology of PS-b-PI copolymer was employed to generate the morphology of elastomeric nanoparticles such as nanofiber and nanosheet. The particles were synthesized using cold vulcanization process. The vulcanization process using <b>sulfur</b> <b>monochloride</b> (S 2 Cl 2) was used to preserve the morphologies. The crosslinking density of block copolymer was controlled by exposure time of crosslinking agent in the chamber. The blend samples for DMA and rheometer were prepared using solvent casting process. The diameter and thickness of nanofiber and nanosheet obtained by the process were ~ 40 nm and ~ 70 nm, respectively. The rheological and dynamic mechanical {{properties of}} the blends of polystyrene (PS) and elastomeric nanoparticles were studied in terms of morphology and crosslinking density. The effect of core PI size also investigated and discussed. Based on these viscoelastic results, the theoretical percolation threshold was calculated and compared with experimental results. It is demonstrated that block copolymer is a facile method to generate elastomeric nanoparticles using cold vulcanization and viscoelastic properties can be tuned with addition of nanoparticles. Ph.

40|$|Oxidation of Hg 0 {{with any}} oxidant or {{converting}} it to a particle-bound form can facilitate its removal. Two sulfur-chlorine compounds, sulfur dichloride (SCl 2) and <b>sulfur</b> <b>monochloride</b> (S 2 Cl 2), were investigated as oxidants for Hg 0 by {{gas phase reaction}} and by surface-involved reactions {{in the presence of}} flyash or activated carbon. The gas phase reaction rate constants between Hg 0 and the sulfur/chlorine compounds were determined, and the effects of temperature and the main components in flue gases were studied. The gas phase reaction between Hg 0 and SCl 2 is shown to be more rapid than the gas phase reaction with chlorine, and the second order rate constant was 9. 1 (+- 0. 5) x 10 - 18 mL-molecules- 1 cdots- 1 at 373 oK. Nitric oxide (NO) inhibited the gas phase reaction of Hg 0 with sulfur-chlorine compounds. The presence of flyash or powdered activated carbon in flue gas can substantially accelerate the reaction. The predicted Hg 0 removal is about 90 percent with 5 ppm SCl 2 or S 2 Cl 2 and 40 g/m 3 of flyash in flue gas. The combination of activated carbon and sulfur-chlorine compounds is an effective alternative. We estimate that co-injection of 3 - 5 ppm of SCl 2 (or S 2 Cl 2) with 2 - 3 Lb/MMacf of untreated Darco-KB is comparable in efficiency to the injection of 2 - 3 Lb/MMacf Darco-Hg-LH. Extrapolation of kinetic results also indicates that 90 percent of Hg 0 can be removed if 3 Lb/MMacf of Darco-KB pretreated with 3 percent of SCl 2 or S 2 Cl 2 is used. Unlike gas phase reactions, NO exhibited little effect on Hg 0 reactions with SCl 2 or S 2 Cl 2 on flyash or activated carbon. Mercuric sulfide was identified as one of the principal products of the Hg 0 /SCl 2 or Hg 0 /S 2 Cl 2 reactions. Additionally, about 8 percent of SCl 2 or S 2 Cl 2 in aqueous solutions is converted to sulfide ions, which would precipitate mercuric ion from FGD solution...|$|E
40|$|Calixarenes, a {{name for}} chalice or vase shaped meta-substituted molecules, have become an {{integral}} part of supramolecular chemistry due to their easy availability, efficient binding abilities and tunable cavities. Due to the multifaceted nature of these macrocycles, the demand for their continual modification and functionalization has become a prime necessity. The unique possibility to modify the upper and lower rim of calixarenes has been a subject of uninterrupted exploration since the last three decades. Along with the functionalization and modification on the annulus of calixarene, efforts were made to modify the core structure of the metacyclophane by introducing a hetero atomic bridge as became evident by the discovery of thiacalixarene. In addition to the extensively explored classical carbon-bridged calixarenes, several other subclasses of the calixarenoid family have been developed. These subclasses are classified according to the bridging atoms and the number of bridging atoms. Heteracalixarenes in general contain one heteroatom bridge (X = N, O, S, Se) e. g. azacalixarenes, oxacalixarenes, thiacalixarenes and selenacalixarenes. On the other hand, homoheteracalixarenes contain three atom bridges, which contain heteroatoms sandwiched between two carbons (-CH 2 -X-CH 2). Synthesis and properties of heteracalixarenes (one atom bridge) and homoheteracalixarenes (three atom bridge) are well studied and documented. However, to our surprise there were no reports about a two atom bridged (CH 2 -X) calixarenoid framework. We envisioned that two atom bridged [2 n] calixarenes would have an intermediate cavity compared to hetera- and homoheteracalixarenes thereby giving rise to entirely new structural and conformational properties. Our previous experience with the chalcogen family (O, S, Se) made sulfur as ourobvious and initial choice of heteroatom to construct a novel [2 n]calixarenoid framework. Inspired by our previous background in pyrimidine chemistry (and SNAr reactions on heteroaromatic systems) it was envisaged to prepare functional [24]thiacalix[2]- arene[2]pyrimidines by SNAr reactions on diverse 4, 6 -dihalopyrimidine building blocks. Efficient one-pot procedures toward thiacalix[4]arenes were developed. Differentiation of both nucleophilic and electrophilic building blocks allowed variation of the substitution pattern of the thiacalix[m]arene[m]pyrimidines (m = 2  4). Through cultivation of single crystals, solid-state structures were obtained and a highly symmetrical 1, 3 -alternate conformation was observed for the [24]thiacalix[2]arene-[2]pyrimidine cyclooligomer. In the second half of thesis work, we study the unique class of para- substituted molecules known as pillararenes. Pillar[n]arenes are the methylene bridged paracyclophanes discovered by the Japanese group Ogoshi et al. in 2008. These molecules are highly symmetrical with rigid structure functionality. In the last five years, various efficient methods to synthesize pillar[n]arenes (n = 5, 6) have been reported. This new macrocycle with high potential attracted our attention in our pursuit towards the construction of an analogues [2 n]macrocycle. Understanding the difficulties in the construction of (Ar-S-CH 2) bridge, We contemplated that constructing disulfide bridged pillar[n]arene would be an ideal starting point to explore this new paracyclophane family. An efficient and robust method towards the synthesis of functionalized disulfide (S-S) bridged pillararenes was developed, starting from 1, 4 -dimethoxy benzene and <b>sulfur</b> <b>monochloride.</b> Taking advantage of the dynamic nature of the disulfide bond, the (S-S) bridges were further converted to (S-CH 2) bridges. In the last part of this thesis, we explore the construction of larger pillar[n]arenes in higher yields, and study their structural features. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false"  nrpages: 191 status: publishe...|$|E
