40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} {{the effect of the}} incorporation of mineral admixtures in <b>superplasticized</b> <b>concrete</b> mixes an experimental programme was carried out. Assuming that the characteristics of the fresh paste controls the rheological properties of the fresh concrete, Marsh cone and mini-slump tests were performed in various pastes containing different dosages of fly ash or limestone filler and made with two different types of superplasticizers. The obtained results indicate that: a) the two tests lead to similar overall results; b) the two superplasticizers used showed different effectiveness; c) the behaviour of the different pastes tested was influenced by the presence of the mineral admixture...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to design, fabricate, and test the {{feasibility}} of a composite structural member {{for use in a}} bicycle frame. The composite members consist of a centrifugally cast low-density concrete hollow tube jacketed with carbon fiber-reinforced plastic. The design optimized the concrete mixture proportions, fiber orientation, frame geometry, and other details required to produce a performance grade bicycle frame. Fabrication included individual structural concrete members, carbon fiber wrapping, and construction of the metal joints and frame. Centrifugally casting <b>superplasticized</b> <b>concrete</b> was the chosen method of fabrication for the concrete portion of the composite members. The application of carbon fiber-reinforced jacketing to concrete structural members has proven to be an effective strength enhancing technique. Bending moment testing was done on the individual composite members and compression testing was performed on concrete mixtures achieving failure strengths of 2280 in-lbs and 1378 psi, respectively. The frame connections were based loosely on industry practice of connecting carbon fiber tubes. The result was a frame that weighs about 6. 6 lbs and has structural characteristics that are desired in a race performance bike...|$|E
40|$|Mechanized {{methods of}} {{vibratory}} concrete consolidation were used on {{all or part}} of fourteen bridge decks in Illinois from 1996 to 1998. The method used on twelve decks consisted of vertical insertion of vibrators in a grid pattern. A transverse drag-through process was used on two decks. Cores were analyzed from decks of both types and compared with cores from conventionally poured decks in order to measure differences in entrapped air voids and in-place density. Based on statistical analysis, the grid pattern method was found to be significantly better than both the drag-through and conventional methods for reducing entrapments per square inch and increasing in-place density. The drag-through method was found to be better than the conventional method for reducing entrapments, but no difference was found for density. Segregation was found in the drag-through cores, but not for either the grid pattern or the conventional method. Some problems were noted on construction sites, mainly having to do with increased weight of the finishing machine and the effect of greater vibration intensity on <b>superplasticized</b> <b>concrete.</b> Costs associated with use of the grid pattern method were approximately $ 6. 58 per square meter ($ 5. 50 per square yard) of bridge deck.

40|$|Synopsis: Composite cements {{containing}} {{portland cement}} (50 %), fly ash (25 %) and slag (25 %), all interground at a Blaine fineness of about 400 or 500 m 2 /kg, were produced. <b>Superplasticized</b> <b>concretes</b> with a slump of 200 - 230 mm were manufactured by using sulfonated naphthalene (SN) or acrylic polymer (AP). The dosage of superplasticizers {{was a little}} higher (10 % more) when finer cements were used. The AP superplasticizer was more effective than that based on SN in terms of lower dosage (20 % less) and lower water-cementitious material ratio (10 % less) at equal workability. Consequently, higher compressive strength were obtained for concretes with the AP admixture rather than with the NS superplasticizer. The better performance of the AP superplasticizer {{with respect to the}} SN admixture was independent of the curing temperature (5 ° or 20 °) at early (1 day) and later ages (28 - 90 days). All the concrete mixtures perform very well for the durability behavior in terms of lower CO 2 penetration and chloride diffusion. However, due to the lower water-cementitious material ratio (0. 29 vs. 0. 32) concretes with the acrylic polymer are potentially more durable than those with the naphthalene-based superplasticizer...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} ways to improve {{physical}} and mechanical properties of cement concrete is an introduction of ash obtained due to {{burning of fossil fuels}} into concrete mix. The concrete mixes with ash are characterized by high cohesion, less water gain and disintegration. At the same time the concrete has high strength, density, water resistance, resistance to sulfate corrosion. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the possibility to use peat ash and slag of peat enterprises of the Republic of Belarus in the concrete for improvement of its physical and mechanical properties and characteristics of peat ash, slag, micro-silica, cement, superplasticizing agent. Compositions and technology for preparation of concrete mixes have been developed and concrete samples have been have been fabricated and tested in the paper. It has been shown that the concrete containing ash, slag obtained due to burning of peat in the industrial installations of the Usiazhsky and Lidsky Peat Briquette Plants and also MK- 85 -grade micro-silica NSPKSAUsF- 1 -grade <b>superplasticizing</b> agent have <b>concrete</b> tensile strength within 78 – 134 MPa under axial compression and 53 MPa – for the control composition. This index is 1. 5 – 2. 5 times more than for the sample containing no additives. The usage of peat ash, slag together with MK- 85 -grade micro-silica and NSPKSAUsF- 1 -grade superplasticizing agent for fabrication of concrete and reinforced bridge and tunnel structures will provide the following advantages: reduction of cross-sectional area of structures while maintaining their bearing capacity due to higher value of tensile strength in case of axial compression; higher density, waterand gas tightness due to low water cement ratio; high resistance to aggressive environment due to lower content of capillary pores that ensures bridge structure longevity; achievement of environmental and social impacts. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{development}} is gaining popularity {{around the globe}} nowadays. Governments are under pressure, on many fronts, to embed sustainable development in policies, practice, and operations to secure the planet's future. Adding to this, increased populations, {{and the need for}} more infrastructures, have unfortunately led to the unacceptable depletion of raw materials, increasing amounts of construction and demolition waste (C&DW) and accelerated deterioration of the natural environment in many places worldwide. For the conservation of natural resources, reuse and recycling of C&DW is the most obvious way to achieve sustainability in the construction sector. Currently, recycled aggregate (RA) is produced from C&DW in modern recycling facilities, under good quality control provisions which could lead to improve its performance compared with the earlier days of recycling. In addition to C&DW, large amounts of industrial and mining by-products such as fly ash, slag, limestone powders, aggregate dust, etc. are dumped in landfills. Fly ash has been used successfully in concrete for a long time due to its numerous advantages across a wide range of properties, including aspects of durability. A concrete produced with the combination of PFA and RA i. e. recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) is obviously more sustainable and economical than conventional natural aggregate concrete (NAC). To date, statistics show that a considerable proportion of the world's RA is used for low-utility applications due to perceived risks and uncertainty over their performance formed as a result of previous history of use when RA was produced manually and low strength cement and higher water to cement ratios were used. Despite the advances in recycling, materials and concreting technologies, this impression prevails. However, to increase the use of RA, it is believed that the quality of RAC should be improved by chemical and mineral additives. For cost effectiveness, quality-improving additives should be abundant, safe, and inexpensive; PFA and new generation polymer-based superplasticizer (SP) are deemed to be a good option. The aims of this study are to investigate the possibility of producing good quality RAC that {{could be used as a}} substitute for NAC in normal strength concrete members, and to study its fundamental properties. An attempt has been made to create <b>superplasticized</b> RAC <b>concretes,</b> in which new generation polymer-based SP and PFA produced to the latest European standards were used. PFA was used to partially replace fine aggregate and cement in ordinary and self-compacting concretes. The thesis also includes an investigation into the potential of utilising an aggregate by-product (red granite dust (RGD) in producing environmentally beneficial RAC. The findings show that good performance RAC can be produced with the help of SP and PFA. The study also revealed that it is possible to utilise RGD to substitute up to 30 % of cement without substantially influencing the performance of concrete, while also providing cost savings. Strengths and stifnesses of the ensuing RAC either with SP, PFA, or RGD were comparable, or better than, a wide range of counterpart NACs. The author's produced RAC concretes can replace NAC concrete used unnecessarily for many applications including structural concrete. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis: The {{influence}} of some pozzolanic additions – such as silica fume, fly ash and ultra-fine amorphous colloidal silica (UFACS) – {{on the performance}} of <b>superplasticized</b> <b>concrete</b> was studied. Superplasticized mixtures in form of flowing (slump of 230 mm) or self-compacting concretes (slump flow of 735 mm) were manufactured all with a water-cement ratio as low as 0. 44, in order to produce high-performance concretes (HPC). They were cured at room temperature (20 °C) or steam-cured at 65 °C in order to simulate the manufacturing of pre-cast members. Concretes with ternary combinations of silica fume (15 - 20 kg/m 3), fly ash (30 - 40 kg/m 3) and UFACS (5 - 8 kg/m 3) perform better – in terms of strength and durability – than those with fly ash alone (60 kg/m 3) and approximately as those with silica fume alone (60 kg/m 3). Due to the reduced availability of silica fume on the market, these ternary combinations can reduce by 60 - 70 % the needed amount of silica fume for each pre-cast HPC element at a given performance level. Moreover, at later ages the strength reduction in steam-cured concretes with respect to the corresponding concretes cured at room temperature, is negligible or much lower in mixtures with the ternary combinations of pozzolanic additions...|$|E
