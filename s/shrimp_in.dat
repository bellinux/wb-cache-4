5|$|C. mutica {{are native}} to shallow {{protected}} {{bodies of water}} in the Sea of Japan. In as little as 40 years, they have become an invasive species in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and along the coasts of New Zealand. They are believed to have been accidentally introduced to these areas through the global maritime traffic and aquaculture. Outside of their native range, C.mutica are often exclusively synanthropic, being found in large numbers in and around areas of human activity. Their ecological and economic impact as an invasive species is unknown, but they pose a serious threat to native populations of skeleton <b>shrimp</b> <b>in</b> the affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{responsible}} for the degradation of fish and <b>shrimp</b> <b>in</b> the creek. The sources for chlorine in urban runoff include irrigation and car washing. The only remaining fish species in the creek is carp, which can withstand high amounts of chlorine. Carp up to 18inches (1.5feet / 45cm) long have been found in Aliso Creek near the mouth. Temperatures of the creek near the mouth have been known to exceed , although the temperature at the outflow is often much colder because it has been mixed with seawater.|$|E
5|$|Within the Malacostraca, no fossils {{are known}} for krill, while both Hoplocarida and Phyllopoda contain {{important}} groups that are now extinct as well as extant members (Hoplocarida: mantis shrimp are extant, while Aeschronectida are extinct; Phyllopoda: Canadaspidida are extinct, while Leptostraca are extant). Cumacea and Isopoda are both known from the Carboniferous, as are the first true mantis <b>shrimp.</b> <b>In</b> the Decapoda, prawns and polychelids appear in the Triassic, and shrimp and crabs appear in the Jurassic; however, the great radiation of crustaceans occurred in the Cretaceous, particularly in crabs, {{and may have been}} driven by the adaptive radiation of their main predators, bony fish. The first true lobsters also appear in the Cretaceous.|$|E

25|$|Many {{animals are}} capable of perceiving some of the {{components}} of the polarization of light, e.g., linear horizontally polarized light. This is generally used for navigational purposes, since the linear polarization of sky light is always perpendicular to the direction of the sun. This ability is very common among the insects, including bees, which use this information to orient their communicative dances. Polarization sensitivity has also been observed in species of octopus, squid, cuttlefish, and mantis <b>shrimp.</b> <b>In</b> the latter case, one species measures all six orthogonal components of polarization, and is believed to have optimal polarization vision. The rapidly changing, vividly colored skin patterns of cuttlefish, used for communication, also incorporate polarization patterns, and mantis shrimp are known to have polarization selective reflective tissue. Sky polarization was thought to be perceived by pigeons, which was assumed to be one of their aids in homing, but research indicates this is a popular myth.|$|E

Comparing the Mortal Kombat characters to the seven deadly sins in Dante's Inferno, Chris Holt of GamePro chose Mileena to represent Envy. Aaron Koehn of GamePro placed Mileena and Kitana eleventh on his 2009 list of the best palette-swapped video game characters, but wrote that [...] "if you gauge Mileena's attractiveness simply based on the size of her baby-feeders, be ready for some disappointment when she removes her mask." [...] ScrewAttack ranked her as seventh on their list of the top ten [...] "ugly chicks in games" [...] for her horrific looks when unmasked, but otherwise calling her [...] "the ultimate woman." [...] Virgin Media included her on their list of the ten [...] "game girls you wouldn't dare to date" [...] for being attractive [...] "until she rips off her veil and reveals her monstrous form beneath." [...] Destructoid's Nick Chester commented: [...] "Her story, as far as I'm concerned, is that she needs to see a dentist." [...] On the other hand, EGMs Eric L. Patterson, stating his preference of Mileena over Kitana, wrote that Mileena's face is actually {{one of the reasons why}} he likes her. Reviewing the Vita version of MK2011, GamesRadar's Jack DeVries called it [...] "as pretty as Mileena minus mask, but overall, just as viciously fun."

40|$|Fishery {{is one of}} the {{sub-sectors}} holding role in {{the national}} economy. Fresh and frozen shrimps are the superior fishery export commodities contributing to Indonesia as the shrimp exporting country. Nevertheless, the volume of <b>shrimp</b> exports <b>in</b> Indonesia is still relatively low compared to that of other exporting countries. This is due to low productivity of <b>shrimp</b> farming <b>in</b> Indonesia. This study aimed to analyze the competitiveness of Indonesian fresh and frozen <b>shrimps</b> <b>in</b> the main export destination countries as well as to analyze the factors influencing the competitiveness in those countries. The data used in this study were series of timeline for 120 months, from January 2005 to December 2014. Thus, the analysis of the competitiveness of Indonesian shrimps was conducted by using Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA), while the analysis of the factors influencing competitiveness of Indonesia shrimps was performed by using the Error Correction Model (ECM). The results showed that the competitiveness of fresh <b>shrimps</b> of Indonesia <b>in</b> its export destination countries is still low compared that of frozen shrimps. One of the factors affecting the competitiveness of fresh shrimp exports from Indonesia to Malaysia in the short term is its total production. The competitiveness of Indonesia frozen <b>shrimps</b> <b>in</b> the United States is influenced by the level of competitiveness of the frozen shrimp exports to America on the previous period, export prices of Vietnamese frozen shrimps, and frozen <b>shrimp</b> production <b>in</b> Indonesia.

40|$|Abstract The muscle {{tissues of}} the Litopenaeus vannamei <b>shrimp</b> grown <b>in</b> ponds through organic and {{traditional}} (intensive) management show that δ 13 C values were similar amongst the <b>shrimp.</b> <b>Shrimp</b> grown <b>in</b> the traditional pond were enriched in 13 C by 7 ‰ {{relative to the}} carbon isotope ratios of their feed. The differences in the carbon isotope ratios of <b>shrimp</b> and feed <b>in</b> the traditional pond shows that the feed is not the main carbon source for <b>shrimp</b> grown <b>in</b> the traditional intensive management.
