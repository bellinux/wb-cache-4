40|$|A space-qualified, high reliability, 150 ft-lb {{rated torque}} rotary {{actuator}} is described. This drive is an integrated variable reluctance orbit motor-epicyclic transmission actuator. The performance goals {{were based on}} future control moment gyrotorquer applications and represent an advancement in the torque-to-weight ratio, backlash, inertia and response characteristics of electric rotary drives. The program accomplishments have been in two areas (1) the development of two high ratio (818 : 1) actuator configurations (breadboard and flightweight) and (2) the invention of a reliable proximity switch sensor system for <b>self-commutation</b> without use of optical or electrical brush techniques...|$|E
40|$|Multilevel current {{reinjection}} (MLCR) concept provides <b>self-commutation</b> {{capability to}} thyristors, enabling thyristor based current source converters (CSC) to operate under negative firing angle. It also lowers the input current harmonic distortion. This {{is achieved by}} using an auxiliary reinjection bridge. Extensive experimental results are {{presented in this paper}} to analyse the performance of the 3 -level MLCR CSC for different snubber components across the reinjection bridge. The trade-off in the choice of the snubber circuit is illustrated, with its influence on the AC side line current and DC side output voltage of the 3 -level MLCR CSC...|$|E
40|$|The {{new concept}} of Multi-Level Current Reinjection (MLCR) {{combines}} {{the advantages of}} DC ripple reinjection, multi-level conversion and soft-switching technique. Taking advantage of the soft-switching technique which uses zero current switching for the main bridge switches, thyristor based MLCR current source converter (CSC) is proposed. This concept adds <b>self-commutation</b> capability to thyristors and produces high quality line current waveforms. Various thyristor based MLCR CSC topologies have been simulated extensively using PSCAD/EMTDC in this thesis and their performance characteristics investigated. Questions have been raised about the ability to force the main thyristors off using the reinjection bridge in a real-world implementation, where there are inevitable stray capacitances and inductances which may influence the thyristor turn-off; and simulation switching models may not represent the switching characteristics fully or accurately. For this proof of concept, a small scale prototype has {{been built in the}} laboratory. The 3 -level MLCR CSC, which increases the pulse number from 12 to 24, is chosen to verify the concept. The experimental investigation of the 3 -level MLCR CSC, under steady-state conditions, verified the following: • The reinjection current allows the main bridge thyristors to be switched at negative firing angles. • This current reinjection technique allows <b>self-commutation</b> capability in a practical system despite the finite turn-off times of the thyristor. • This current reinjection technique improves the harmonic characteristics of the thyristor based converter. • It is observed that the deviation of the actual waveforms from the theoretical waveforms is mainly due to the snubber across the reinjection switch, and a trade-off in the choice of snubber components is required...|$|E
