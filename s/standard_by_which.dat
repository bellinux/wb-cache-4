5|$|Along the way, Rolling Thunder also fell prey to {{the same}} {{dysfunctional}} managerial attitude as did {{the rest of the}} American military effort in Southeast Asia. The process of the campaign became an end unto itself, with sortie generation as the <b>standard</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> progress was measured. Sortie rates and the number of bombs dropped, however, equaled efficiency, not effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Kuhn {{denied that}} it is ever {{possible}} to isolate the hypothesis being tested from {{the influence of the}} theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued {{that it is}} not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a <b>standard</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure scientific progress across paradigms.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus is {{the type}} genus of the {{superfamily}} Tyrannosauroidea, the family Tyrannosauridae, and the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae; in other words it is the <b>standard</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> paleontologists decide whether to include other species in the same group. Other members of the tyrannosaurine subfamily include the North American Daspletosaurus and the Asian Tarbosaurus, {{both of which have}} occasionally been synonymized with Tyrannosaurus. Tyrannosaurids were once commonly thought to be descendants of earlier large theropods such as megalosaurs and carnosaurs, although more recently they were reclassified with the generally smaller coelurosaurs.|$|E

25|$|A {{modeling}} {{system based on}} {{a better understanding of}} the termination targeting of lightning, called the Rolling Sphere Method, was developed by Dr Tibor Horváth. It has become the <b>standard</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> traditional Franklin Rod systems are installed. To understand this requires knowledge of how lightning 'moves'. As the step leader of a lightning bolt jumps toward the ground, it steps toward the grounded objects nearest its path. The maximum distance that each step may travel is called the critical distance and is proportional to the electric current. Objects are likely to be struck if they are nearer to the leader than this critical distance. It is standard practice to approximate the sphere's radius as 46m near the ground.|$|E
25|$|While {{the methods}} behind {{collecting}} bite mark {{evidence at the}} scene are leading toward greater standardization, the methodology behind analyzing bite marks is extremely variable because it depends upon the preference of the specific odontologist. As discussed earlier, there are several methods used to compare bite marks ranging from life sized photographs to computer enhanced 3-dimensional imaging. These methods vary in precision and accuracy, {{and there is no}} set <b>standard</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> to compare or analyze them. The lack of analytical standards leads to a wide array of interpretation with any bite mark evidence. Some odontologists even disagree on whether or not a mark on the body {{is the result of a}} bite. Therefore, the interpretation of evidence lies largely on the expertise of the forensic odontologist handling the case.|$|E
25|$|Bites {{can occur}} {{on both the}} victim and the suspect; teeth are used as weapon by the aggressor and in self-defense by the victim. Although they are {{only a small portion}} of most {{forensic}} dentist’s case load, bite marks represent the most challenging aspect of the discipline. In addition to the location of the bite mark the type of severity of the injury may give investigators clues as to the mental state of the offender. Bite marks may be found on the flesh of victims of a violent attack, particularly on the stomach or buttocks. Alternatively they may be found on the suspect, left by the victim during self-defense. Bite marks can be altered through stretching, movement, or change in environment after the bite. There is also no set <b>standard</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> to analyse and compare bite marks.|$|E

25|$|On September 25, 2007, the United States Supreme Court {{agreed to}} hear a lethal-injection {{challenge}} arising from Kentucky, Baze v. Rees.

Although uncertainty over whether executions in the United States would be put on hold during the period in which the United States Supreme Court considers the constitutionality of lethal injection initially arose after the court agreed to hear Baze, no executions took place during the period between when the court agreed to hear the case and when its ruling was announced, {{with the exception of one}} lethal injection in Texas hours after the court made its announcement.|$|E

[...] For many years afterward, the Halifax Explosion was the <b>standard</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> all large blasts were measured.

[...] McNair had advocated this tactic since World War I; he again agreed with the Gunnery Department, and worked to help implement this doctrinal change while also protecting the Gunnery Department from outside interference. [...] Over time, improvements to communications equipment and procedures and changes to doctrine enabled implementation {{of many of these}} changes, and they largely became the <b>standard</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> field artillery units conducted operations in World War II.|$|E
