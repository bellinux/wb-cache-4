Journal pages are narrated by {{the voice of the}} character, and missing pages of the journal appear translucent in menus.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the most}} serious {{deliberate}} damage happened during the night of 12/13 May 2014, when the tallest trunk was sawn off at its base with a chainsaw, by unknown perpetrators. Following the vandalism, the severed trunk was <b>stored,</b> <b>and</b> it was eventually decided to re-attach it with artificial supports, several steel straps connecting the trunk to the base; this work {{was carried out in}} early July 2015 at a cost of €35,000, shared by the Catalan government and the Barcelona provincial administration.|$|E
5|$|Southampton was an {{important}} trading port in the 12th century, with trade routes to Normandy, the Levant and Gascony. The castle played {{an important}} role in this trade, in part forming a warehouse for the king's imports, this process being managed by a Crown Bailiff. Royal purchases of wine were particularly important for the castle, being <b>stored</b> <b>and</b> distributed to royal properties across the south of England. The former castle hall was turned into a subterranean vault in the 13th century, probably for storing wine.|$|E

5|$|The Great New York City Fire of 1845 {{broke out}} on July 19, 1845. The fire started in a whale oil and candle {{manufacturing}} establishment and quickly {{spread to other}} wooden structures in New York City the neighborhood. It reached a warehouse on Broad Street where combustible saltpeter was <b>stored</b> <b>and</b> caused a massive explosion that spread the fire even farther.|$|E
5|$|The depot <b>stored</b> <b>and</b> {{dispatched}} {{every item}} that the RAF used in wartime, from knives and forks to aircraft engines. The site was {{served by a}} large, internal railway system which left the Manchester to Crewe mainline prior to Handforth railway station. The site of the exchange sidings and junction is {{at the rear of}} the Pets At Home offices on Epsom Avenue. The depot had its own shunting locomotives, which were stored in an engine shed that stood at the Wilmslow bound exit slip road for the Handforth Dean shopping centre.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{feature of}} Solar Two was {{its use of}} molten salt to capture and store the sun's heat. The very hot salt was <b>stored</b> <b>and</b> used when needed to produce steam to drive a turbine/generator that {{produces}} electricity. The system operated smoothly through intermittent clouds and continued generating electricity long into the night. Solar Two was decommissioned in 1999, and was converted by the University of California, Davis, into CACTUS, an Air Cherenkov Telescope, in 2001, measuring gamma rays hitting the atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|There {{are ongoing}} {{programs}} {{working on a}} dengue vaccine to cover all four serotypes. Now {{that there is a}} fifth serotype this will need to be factored in. One of the concerns is that a vaccine could increase the risk of severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The ideal vaccine is safe, effective after one or two injections, covers all serotypes, does not contribute to ADE, is easily transported and <b>stored,</b> <b>and</b> is both affordable and cost-effective.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{down the}} line, the train passes the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad mine train roller coaster {{attraction}} and traverses a swing bridge, which crosses a canal {{that connects the}} Rivers of America to a boat servicing area. This bridge was originally located in Wabasso, Florida, and was previously owned by the Florida East Coast Railway. The train then runs through an area where numerous static and Audio-Animatronic displays of Native Americans and wild animals can be seen. After that, the train goes under an overpass, passes the spur line leading to the WDWRR's roundhouse where its trains are <b>stored</b> <b>and</b> maintained, and arrives at its next stop at Fantasyland Station.|$|E
5|$|In 1798 Baker {{received}} a third official appointment, as government storekeeper for the Hawkesbury region {{in addition to}} his equivalent duties in Parramatta. Despite his past experience, Baker was quickly found wanting in the management of the stores, specifically those for farmers near the settlement of Windsor. In 1798 the local grain harvest was too large to be receipted and stored in the Windsor storehouse, so Baker elected to fill that store solely with produce supplied by the region's three largest landholders. In consequence, smaller farmers at Windsor had no means of selling or storing their grain and were brought close to bankruptcy. Baker was deaf to their complaints, and Governor Hunter was forced to intervene in person to keep the peace. In a letter on 19 April, sent via the New South Wales Corps commander in Hawkesbury, Hunter directed Baker to return half of the harvest he had already <b>stored,</b> <b>and</b> instead fill the storehouse with goods from smaller farms.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, a five-gondola {{train set}} with green-and-white-striped awnings and a five-gondola train set with blue-and-white-striped awnings, {{referred}} to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Green and Holiday Blue respectively, {{were added to the}} DRR's rolling stock. Both train sets had side-facing bench seating like the Holiday Red freight train. By the time that the new Holiday Green and Holiday Blue trains sets were introduced in 1966, the DRR's original roundhouse, located {{on the end of a}} spur line connected to the main line near the Rivers of America in the Frontierland section, had been replaced by a larger roundhouse, located on the end of a new spur line connected to the main line in the Tomorrowland section. The new roundhouse, where the DRR's locomotives and train cars are <b>stored</b> <b>and</b> maintained, was also built to house the storage and maintenance facility for the Disneyland Monorail.|$|E
5|$|Several relief {{agencies}} were already positioned {{in the region}} {{in response to a}} magnitude 6.9 earthquake in January of that year that killed over 20,000 people. Additional disaster relief teams were deployed to the region to further prepare residents for the cyclone. Food, water and other necessities were <b>stored</b> <b>and</b> ready to be provided to victims of the storm. Large swells produced by the storm affected {{a large portion of the}} western Indian coastline, especially in the city of Bombay. In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by the storm. Offshore, between 1,500 and 2,000 fishing vessels had lost contact with the mainland. Later reports indicated that between 120 and 900 fishermen had gone missing as a result of the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was {{included on the}} Antiquities List of 1925, as La Castellania.

The court documents, of the Magna Curia Castellania (MCC), are now <b>stored</b> <b>and</b> conserved at the Banca Giuratale in Mdina. The documents form part of the National Archives of Malta and are used by historians as primary sources to research about Malta during the knights of St. John. The archives of the Acta Originalia of the Magna Curia Castellania (AOM) include 1,411 volumes, dating from {{the early years of}} the rule of the knights.|$|E

5|$|The pallium is a {{layer of}} gray matter that lies {{on the surface of}} the {{forebrain}} and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ. In reptiles and mammals, it is called the cerebral cortex. Multiple functions involve the pallium, including smell and spatial memory. In mammals, where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain, it takes over functions from many other brain areas. In many mammals, the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci. The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be <b>stored</b> <b>and</b> processed.|$|E
5|$|The {{responsibility}} for supplying the army rested with the praefectus praetorio of the operational sector. He in turn controlled {{a hierarchy of}} civilian authorities (diocesan vicarii and provincial governors), whose agents collected, <b>stored</b> <b>and</b> delivered supplies to the troops directly or to predetermined fortified points. The quantities involved were enormous and would require lengthy and elaborate planning for major campaigns. A late legion of 1,000 men would require a minimum of 2.3 tonnes of grain-equivalent every day. An imperial escort army of 25,000 men would thus require around 5,000 tonnes of grain-equivalent for three months' campaigning (plus fodder for the horses and pack animals).|$|E
5|$|A later, ground-attack variant, this is {{displayed}} at the Royal Air Force Museum in London; it was captured by British forces at Eggebek, Schleswig-Holstein in May 1945. It {{is thought to have}} been built in 1943–1944 as a D-5 before being rebuilt as a G-2 variant, possibly by fitting G-2 outer wings to a D-5 airframe. The wings have the hard-points for Bordkanone BK 3,7 gun-pods, but these are not fitted. It was one of 12 captured German aircraft selected by the British for museum preservation and assigned to the Air Historical Branch. The aircraft was <b>stored</b> <b>and</b> displayed at various RAF sites until 1978, when it was moved to the RAF Museum. In 1967, permission was given to use the aircraft in the film Battle of Britain and it was repainted and modified to resemble a 1940 variant of the Ju 87. The engine was found to be in excellent condition and there was little difficulty in starting it, but returning the aircraft to airworthiness was considered too costly for the filmmakers, and ultimately, models were used in the film to represent Stukas. In 1998, the film modifications were removed, and the aircraft returned to the original G-2 configuration.|$|E
