Thus, the flexibility of the programmed task increases and also moving surfaces can be finished. This paper aims to focus on this control concept. Design/methodology/approach - The developed concept relies both on the use of a new <b>slip</b> <b>sensor</b> which is able to measure relative motion between the robot end-effector and the machined object surface as well as on a continuous slip and force control algorithm. First experimental results were used to validate the concept. Findings - The presented results were promising enough to encourage the application of the proposed concept scheme in connection with the <b>slip</b> <b>sensor</b> in industrial finishing applications. Research limitations/implications - The first investigations provide a basis for the development of more accurate software solutions in order to optimise the performances of the <b>slip</b> <b>sensor.</b> Practical implications - The developed <b>slip</b> <b>sensor</b> provides a cheap and flexible solution for measuring relative motion between tool and surface. Combined {{with the use of a}} force sensor, the proposed scheme can be introduce more autonomy in industrial application like polishing or deburring. Originality/value - The paper introduces a novel slip and force control concept for coping with the industry requirement of introducing more automation in the finishing of surfaces. Such a control concept allows on one hand the finishing of moving parts and at the same time increases the flexibility of the programming and reduces the user effort...|$|E

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of a <b>slip</b> <b>sensor</b> in a prosthetic hand {{is thought to be}} advantageous in controlling both hands with multiple movements and conventional hands with a single movement. A <b>slip</b> <b>sensor</b> would be used as part of a control system to automatically adjust the force applied to an object if it begins to slip from the hand. This would remove the need for the user to visually assess the object they are grasping, as well as reduce the need to apply large forces to the object. Piezoelectric sensors produce a charge when mechanically deformed, through the action of an applied force. This charge decays with time dependant upon the connected electronics. Piezoelectric sensors are therefore considered an ideal candidate for detecting the vibrations (change in surface forces) associated with object slip from a prosthetic hand...|$|E

40|$|Future {{advanced}} artificial hands {{will require}} the automatic holding of objects using feedback control. To achieve this aim will require sensors of various types, one of which should be capable of detecting the relative movement between {{the surface of a}} grasped object and the hand (slip). A low-cost sensor, using thick-film technology, has been developed which detects slip using the piezoelectric effect. Experimental evaluation of the sensor has been carried out using a test apparatus whereby a block of aluminium representing an object slides past the sensor. Attached to the object surface is a Perspex sheet with repeating groves cut into the surface. Two different separations of the groves have been tested. The results show that the <b>slip</b> <b>sensor</b> detects the relative velocity between a moving object and the sensor surface. The sensor has a frequency response into the kilohertz which makes it an excellent candidate for a <b>slip</b> <b>sensor.</b> The sensor is able to detect slip with and without a cosmetic material covering the sensor.

40|$|The {{ability to}} mimic the tactile {{feedback}} exhibited by the human hand in an artificial limb is considered advantageous in the automatic control of new multifunctional prosthetic hands. The role of a <b>slip</b> <b>sensor</b> in this tactile feedback is to detect object slip and thus provide information to a controller, which automatically adjusts the grip force applied to a held object {{to prevent it from}} falling. This system reduces the cognitive load experienced by the user by not having to visually assess the stability of an object, as well as giving them the confidence not to apply unnecessarily excessive grip forces. A candidate for such a sensor is a thick-film piezoelectric sensor. The method of fabricating a thick-film piezoelectric <b>slip</b> <b>sensor</b> on a prototype fingertip is described. The construction of experimental apparatus to mimic slip has been designed and analysed to allow the coefficient of friction between the fingertip and the material in contact with the fingertip to be calculated. Finally, results show that for a coefficient of friction between the fingertip and grade P 100 sandpaper of approximately 0. 3, an object velocity of 0. 025 ± 0. 008 ms- 1 was reached before a slip signal from the piezoelectric sensor was able to be used to detect slip. It is anticipated that this limiting velocity will be lowered (improved) in the intended application where the sensor electronics will be powered from a battery, connections will be appropriately screened and if necessary a filter employed. This will remove mains interference and reduce other extraneous noise sources with the consequence of an improved signal to noise ratio, allowing lower threshold values {{to be used in the}} detection software...|$|E

30|$|There {{are mainly}} two trends for {{developing}} DRHs, one is anthropomorphism-oriented {{and the other}} is task-oriented. For the first one, the robot hands are devised with much more human-like properties, as in its kinematics (hand structure, DOFs, grasping functionality, etc.), dynamics (stiffness, damping, friction, etc.), and perception capabilities (position sensors, force/torque <b>sensors,</b> tactile grid, <b>slipping</b> <b>sensors,</b> etc.). While for the task-oriented trend, the DRHs are designed according to some specialized tasks or environments, such as the Robonaut 2 hand and Dexhand, both for extravehicular activities on the ISS. Generally speaking, the word “anthropomorphism” is a very complicated concept including numerous influential factors that lacking anyone of them may lead to an underperformance design. Under current conditions, how to make a compromise between the hand’s appearance and functionality, or how to establish a proper performance index [57] to compare design and thus make a suitable choice among alternatives, is still an urgent work in the robot hand research.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new {{method of detection}} and measurement of fingertip slip {{on the surface of}} a manipulated object in a multi-fingered precision manipulation with rolling contact. Due to the fact that slip sensors are still in a basic research phase and no <b>slip</b> <b>sensor</b> is compatible with the actual fingertip manipulation, our method is based on the multi-sensor fusion of vision, joint-encoders of the fingers, and finger-tip force/torque sensors. Position of the contact between the object and the fingertip is computed in realtime from the measured pose of the object and the fingertip position. Slip displacement of the fingertip contact is then separated from the displacement by rolling motion of the fingertip. Reliability of the slip detection from the noisy data is improved using the tangential-to-normal ratio of the measured force at the contact and the mutual relationship between the tangential force and the direction of the contact displacement. Results of the experiments show the effectiveness of the method...|$|E

40|$|The {{key element}} of robot is its gripper system, which can {{accommodate}} a variety of work pieces. Two finger grippers sometimes of lever type, cam type, gear type or mixed type are very common for many industrial applications. The present paper aims at the design and development of a four-fingered dextrous gripper with suitable electrical actuator system for transferring and transmitting flexural motions of the articulated fingers with suitable mechanical structures and tendons. Various hardware elements have been designed, constructed and evaluated for the dextrous hand. Each finger is having distal, proximal and metacarpophalangeal joints having three degrees of freedom so as to open and close with different postures for manipulating the objects with electric tendon actuation system. As a first step towards achieving pretension, optimal flexibility, high performance and well-behaved characteristics of the gripper, a multiple degree-of-freedom dextrous hand has been designed, constructed and evaluated.

40|$|The {{following}} document {{sets out}} to determine the key limitations to existing methods of acquiring body slip angle data and how could accurate live body slip angle provide better information about a vehicle’s current behavior to aid vehicle safety systems. Initially, body slip angle estimation techniques are evaluated as these methods are currently used in electronic stability control systems, as current vehicles do not have body <b>slip</b> angle <b>sensors.</b> It is clear to see that all the different estimations methods have clear limitations. With this in mind existing methods of measuring body slip angle were investigated, such as optical sensors, GPS and Doppler velocity sensors. It is clear that laser Doppler velocity sensors could be an accurate method of measuring body slip angle on consumer vehicles, therefore a body slip angle based electronic stability control system using laser doppler velocity sensors is proposed. In order to further validate body slip angle based electronic stability control systems, several multi body simulations are carried out. The multi body simulations show that an electronic stability control system based on body slip angle is feasible. The simulations also show that in low coefficient of friction conditions the body slip angle is a better indicator of vehicle behavior than yaw rate. In conclusion, {{it is clear to}} see {{that there is a need}} in the automotive industry for direct real time <b>slip</b> angle <b>sensors,</b> but further research is required to determine the robustness and viability of body slip angle targeted ESC systems...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the slip}} {{indicator}} {{was designed and}} constructed {{for the purpose of}} monitoring the slippage of the tractor powered wheel during the operation of plowing and of applying the output signal to control the draft force acting on the plow. In the previous work conducted by one of the authors, two AC generators were attached to front and rear wheels of the tractor to detect their rotational speed, and the slippage was calculated from the output voltage signal proportional to the rotational speed of the wheels. In the use of this type of <b>slip</b> <b>sensor,</b> some difficulty was found in adjusting and resetting the voltage corresponding to the zero slippage, depending on the running gear prior to the operation. A different type of <b>slip</b> <b>sensor</b> was therefore designed and constructed to remedy this disadvantage. The photo-electric type pulse generator was used to detect the rotational speed of both front and rear wheels through the mechanical amplification by use of gears to obtain the required numbers of pulses per unit rotation of the wheel. The number of pulses generated from the wheels was converted to the frequency and then to the voltage. This output voltage was compared to the set voltage which corresponds to the set slippage. In turn this is properly determined from the relationship between the slippage and the pulling froce expressing the different shape due to the soil condition and running device. The difference between the output voltage and set voltage was amlified. Then the relay connected to the hydraulic directional valve to control lifting and lowering the implement mounted on the three point linkage moved on off, depending on the voltage difference. The slippage calculated from the difference indicated through the monitoring device mounted on the platform located in front of operator's seat. This monitoring device worked quite satisfactorily to help the operator in knowing how much draft force was acting on the implement through the indicated value of the slippage. The field test was done to validate the accurate response and action of the implement under slip draft control in two kinds of fields, sandy and paddy, after harvesting of rice. Through the satisfactory result of the field experiments, it was observed that this type of slip draft control system described here would be possible to apply to a commercial tractor without much modification and improvements. No problems of cost, accuracy or durability for practical use were found...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part I: Journal of Systems and Control Engineering [© IMechE]. Grasping a soft or fragile object requires the use of minimum contact force to prevent damage or deformation. Without precise knowledge of object parameters, real-time feedback control must be used with a suitable <b>slip</b> <b>sensor</b> to regulate the contact force and prevent slip. Furthermore, the controller must be designed to have good performance characteristics to rapidly modulate the fingertip contact force in response to a slip event. In this paper, a fuzzy sliding mode controller combined with a disturbance observer is proposed for contact force control and slip prevention. The controller is based on a system model that is suitable for a wide class of robotic gripper configurations. The robustness of the controller is evaluated through both simulation and experiment. The control scheme was found to be effective and robust to parameter uncertainty. When tested on a real system, however, chattering phenomena, well known to sliding mode research, was induced by the unmodelled suboptimal components of the system (filtering, backlash, and time delays), and the controller performance was reduced...|$|E

40|$|Current {{literature}} {{focusing on}} the prosthetic socket is limited by measurement techniques and modeling assumptions, leading to a limited understanding of the forces and motions occurring between the residual limb and prosthesis {{and how they can}} be used to influence socket design and fitting. Prosthetic socket fitting and prescription would benefit from an elegant method for comparing socket designs. This dissertation focuses on {{the development and implementation of}} a 3 D motion capture model and a <b>Slip</b> Detection <b>Sensor</b> to quantify rotations and translations at the prosthetic socket-residual limb interface. The 3 D motion capture model defines the residual limb bone position inside the prosthetic socket which allows for measurement of the movement occurring at the prosthetic socket interface. The <b>Slip</b> Detection <b>Sensor</b> is an optoelectronic sensor embedded into the prosthetic socket wall to measure the amount of socket slip occurring between the socket wall and the residual limb skin surface. The motion capture model and <b>Slip</b> Detection <b>Sensor</b> were used to measure motion at the socket interface of transhumeral amputees during activities of daily living. Data were collected on six transhumeral amputees in the University of South Florida 2 ̆ 7 s (USF) motion analysis laboratory. One of the participants completed the collection procedures twice using two different suspension systems (pin locking versus no pin locking) within the same socket. An eight camera Vicon (Oxord, UK) motion capture system was used to collect kinematic data for each participant during the repetition of a series of range of motion (RoM) and activities of daily living (ADL). The RoM tasks included shoulder flexion/extension, shoulder abduction/adduction, shoulder rotation, and elbow flexion. The ADL tasks included a bilateral and unilateral lifting task at various weight increments, modified box and blocks test, folding a towel, and walk and carry a gallon jug of water. The impact of donning the prosthesis on the participant 2 ̆ 7 s RoM and the amount of socket movement during the ADL tasks was analyzed. The results show that the participant 2 ̆ 7 s shoulder RoM significantly decreased while wearing their prosthesis compared to when they were not wearing their prosthesis. The anterior-posterior tilt, medial-lateral tilt, and socket vertical translation were more directly correlated with the amount of residual limb movement than with the force acting on the prosthetic hand. Socket slip was most directly correlated with the force acting on the prosthetic hand. The results also show that the amount of translation was reduced when the pin locking suspension was used compared to when it wasn 2 ̆ 7 t for the individual participant who used both suspension systems within the same socket. The motion capture data were used to determine the amount of socket movement during activities of daily living while avoiding many of the limitations of other socket interface studies. The <b>Slip</b> Detection <b>Sensor</b> provided experimental data on the amount of slip occurring between the residual limb skin surface and socket wall. This method seems to be a useful tool for evaluating socket performance in terms of movement. Ultimately, socket interface movement data can be used to providing clinicians with quantitative results of a good socket fit to aid in the socket fitting and prescription process and incorporated into adjustable interfaces. Collection of data on more participants with various socket types is needed to make more general conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Grasping {{randomly}} placed fragile objects {{within a}} complex environment by a humanoid robot is an ambitious basic skill {{which requires a}} smart visually and haptically controlled hand. The first phase of this dexterous manipulation task comprising both perception of the object and visual servoing of the robot hand relies on two cameras: a wide range stereo camera integrated in the robot head {{as well as a}} close range camera embedded in a five finger robotic hand (figure 1). A robust visually controlled grasping of objects is achieved, even in the case of disturbed signals or dynamic obstacles, by using a fuzzy decision making algorithm for the optimal fusion of information from both cameras. Moreover, the hand camera can obviate occlusions of the head camera e. g. caused by the robot arm. In {{the second phase of the}} task a safe stable grasping is achieved by a smart haptic control concept using integrated tactile arrays and <b>slip</b> <b>sensors.</b> Optimally controlled contact forces avoid both slipping of the object due to low friction as well as destruction of the fragile object structure due to high contact pressure. Since the friction coefficient is estimated at the beginning of every grasping process in the case of varying or unknown friction coefficients, the haptic control parameters can be adapted automatically. In the case of disturbances (e. g. due to varying liquid mass in the glass), the gripper reacts immediately to a minimal slip of the object by an increase of contact force. The optimal coordination of the different visual and haptic motion phases is managed by a multi-sensor based, discrete-continuous supervisory control concept in which each skill is divided into a sequence of primitive skills [Milighetti 2007 b]. Both theoretical approach and experimental results of the ongoing research within the Collaborative Research Centre SFB 588 "Humanoid Robots" will be presented in this paper...|$|R

Failure in the bonding mechanism that secures the PZT layer to the stainless steel cantilever meant that the proposed dynamic force sensor could not be evaluated.

40|$|This {{research}} programme investigates aspects of end effector design and control, {{to carry out}} grasping operations {{in a range of}} unstructured environments. A conceptual three fingered end effector design has been developed. The articulated finger is operated by a novel mechanism which provides all the finger motions. Detailed force and kinematic analyses have been carried out which establish mechanical integrity of the system and help size the various finger components. A vectorial method of link representation has been used to derive finger kinematics. This representation has been used for position control in the controller. A numerical technique based on the Newton- Raphson method has been derived to undertake the finger's inverse kinematics in realtime. To validate the theoretical operation of the finger drive, a mechanism has been built with the necessary electronic interface, and programmed for position control. A photoelasticity based sensor has been developed which is capable of detecting applied force as well as slip and is largely immune to external disturbances. The sensor has a small size allowing it to be easily incorporated into a robotic finger. Mechanics of slip has been investigated to develop a theoretical model of the <b>slip</b> <b>sensor.</b> This allows modelling of various material and geometrical parameters involved in its design. In order to control the end effector, grasping strategies have been planned and a controller structure defined. The top level of the controller uses the kinematic relation to move the finger to a goal position. When fingers make contact with an object, the controller switches over to an inner fiizzy logic algorithm. The rule base of the fiizzy logic ensures that a stable grasp has been acquired with minimum fingertip force. The implementation of the fuzzy logic has been validated on an experimental test-rig. It has been found that the controller applies different minimum fingertip force to objects of different mass and it responds very quickly to the external disturbances by applying extra force to the object. The fingertip force comes back to its previous level as soon as the disturbance vanishes. The important feature exhibited by the controller is that it forms optimal grasp of objects without knowing their mass and frictional properties. This offers a very useful capability to an end effector controller operating in unstructured environments. A complete model of the end effector has been developed which ensures equilibrium and stability of the grasped object taking dynamic conditions of grasp into account. The model estimates unbalances in position, force and moment of the grasped object and tries to minimise these unbalances. The simulated results have shown that for every grasp situation, the algorithm is capable of minimising the unbalances and the operation of the algorithm is fast enough for real-time applications...|$|E

Two dimensional positions to compensate the wafer <b>slip</b> from measured <b>sensor</b> signal are calculated by using the compensation algorithm. Automatic wafer centering system is developed and verification test is conducted. In the verification test, developed automatic wafer centering system has measurement accuracy of under 0. 2 mm for radial and tangential direction...|$|R
30|$|Most of the {{existing}} bending sensors are non-stretchable, and they will slip when fingers bend. So traditional data gloves {{have to be made}} larger than the hand size to reserve some space for the <b>sensors</b> to <b>slip.</b> The gap between the glove and hand may cause some significant error. For the fabric data-collecting glove, the glove size can be fully customized due to the stretch ability of the EPR-based bending sensor. Each sensor can be fixed on the fabric glove without slipping so the error caused by <b>sensor</b> <b>slipping</b> can be minimized.|$|R

The ultrasonic sensor consists of piezoelectric PZT thin film on a Pt/Ti/SiO 2 and/or Sidiaphragm fabricated using a micromachining technique; the ultrasonic sensor detects the piezoelectric voltage asan ultrasonic wave. The sensitivity has been enhanced by improving the device structure, and the resonant frequencyin the array sensor has been equalized. Position detection {{has been carried}} out by using a sensor array with highsensitivity and uniform resonant frequency. The tactile sensor consists of four or three warped cantilevers which haveNiCr or Si:B+ piezoresistive layer for stress detection. Normal and shear stresses can be estimated by calculation usingresistance changes of the piezoresitive layers on the cantilevers. Gripping state has been identified by using the tactilesensor which is installed on finger of a robot hand, and friction of objects has been measured by <b>slipping</b> the <b>sensor...</b>|$|R
