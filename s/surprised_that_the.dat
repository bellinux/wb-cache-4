5|$|Jackie's friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall {{had become}} {{suspicious}} {{as to whether}} Jackie's date to the fraternity party where she was allegedly raped was a real person. Prior to the date, they attempted to locate him in a student directory and were unable to find evidence that he existed. The trio also sent text messages to a phone number Jackie said was the mobile phone of her date and were <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> owner of the phone number responded primarily with flattering messages about Randall, whom Jackie was romantically interested in.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{production}} was tumultuous. Chettiar opposed casting Rajinikanth as the protagonist {{because of his}} dark skin and typecasting as a villain at the time, but Mahendran refused to direct the film without the actor and Chettiar capitulated. Since Mahendran had no previous directing experience, cinematographer Balu Mahendra (a director himself) assisted Mahendran with the screenplay, dialogue, camera angles, casting and editing. The film significantly deviates from the novel, with Mahendran having read {{only a part of}} it. Filming lasted for roughly 30 days, and primarily took place in Sringeri. Chettiar was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> finished film had less dialogue than visuals, which he did not expect from Mahendran.|$|E
5|$|Burnet {{was opposed}} {{to the use of}} nuclear power in Australia owing to the issues of nuclear proliferation. He later {{retracted}} his objections to uranium mining in Australia, feeling that nuclear power was necessary while other renewable energy sources were being developed. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was also vocal in the anti-smoking movement; {{he was one of the}} first high-profile figures in Australia to educate the public on the dangers of tobacco, and he appeared in a television advertisement criticising the ethics of tobacco advertising, and broadcasters for displaying such material. He and fellow activists were <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> commercial was allowed to run briefly, before being taken off air by the station, which only further generated attention for the anti-smoking campaign. A former smoker, he had rejected the habit in the 1950s after several friends died. Burnet was also a critic of the Vietnam War and called for the creation of an international police force.|$|E

5|$|King William {{appears to}} have left the {{initiative}} for Stigand's deposition to the papacy, and did nothing to hinder Stigand's authority until the papal legates arrived in England to depose the archbishop and reform the English Church. Besides witnessing charters and consecrating Remigius, Stigand {{appears to have}} been a member of the royal council, and able to move freely about the country. But after the arrival of the legates, William did nothing to protect Stigand from deposition, and the archbishop later accused the king of acting with bad faith. Stigand may even have been <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> legates wished him deposed. It was probably the death of Ealdred in 1069 that moved the pope to send the legates, as that left only one archbishop in England; and he was not considered legitimate and unable to consecrate bishops. The historian George Garnett draws the parallel between the treatment of King Harold in Domesday Book, where he is essentially ignored as king, and Stigand's treatment after his deposition, where his time as archbishop is as much as possible treated as not occurring.|$|E

25|$|Leach did {{not think}} that the crimes {{surrounding}} the failure of the Whitewater-tied S should have been considered in an impeachment framework. Like many in Congress, he was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Justice Department chose to refer certain sex-related charges to Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, and even more so when Starr chose subsequently to refer certain of them to the Congress. But in what he described as a close judgment call, Leach voted for the article of impeachment that related to felonious lying under oath.|$|E
25|$|The strike lasted 172 days, at {{the time}} making it ({{at the time}}) the longest in UAW history and the longest strike in International Harvester history. International Harvester made key errors—including using inexperienced negotiators, going public with {{bargaining}} demands, and attacking key union issues such as seniority {{and the lack of}} mandatory overtime without giving itself room to negotiate—which greatly prolonged the strike. The seeming arrogance of top company officials is {{considered by many to be}} a serious strategic error. Company officials seemed <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> union could hold out for any length of time, and McCardell appeared to assume that the international union staff (not rank and file members) were pushing for a strike.|$|E
25|$|When Rangers bought striker Marco Negri in {{the summer}} 1997, Andersen left the club shortly thereafter. He scored 15 goals in 23 league games for the club. A number of clubs were {{interested}} in Andersen, but the transfer fee demands of Rangers proved too high, and Andersen had to rescind the sign-on fee of £300,000 Rangers still owed him from the Aalborg BK transfer, before an offer was accepted. He later regretted having caved in to Rangers, claiming he should have played hard-ball {{in order to get}} the money owed to him, inspired by the approach of Peter Møller. During pre-season training Paul Gascoigne had urinated on Andersen. Team-mate Lorenzo Amoruso was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Dane responded with meek acceptance.|$|E

500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the episode, Liz and Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) are exchanging Yo Mamma Jokes. According to Fey, Liz's joke, [...] "What's the difference between your mama and a washing machine? When I drop a load in the washing machine, it doesn't follow me around for a week", was [...] "pretty dirty", and was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> show was able to get away with the joke. It has since been censored in syndication.|$|E
500|$|... : A {{character}} who converses with Saya {{over the course}} of the series, being the one responsible for granting her wish to remain herself. Its true identity is the familiar of Kimihiro Watanuki, a character from the manga series xxxHolic. The dog is voiced by Jun Fukuyama in Japanese. When he was recording his dialogue for the series, Fukuyama was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> very last line of the final episode was given to a dog. In the English dub, the dog is voiced by Todd Haberkorn.|$|E

500|$|Merry {{suggested}} that, {{regardless of}} cultural differences, {{the story is}} universal due to [...] "its themes of loss and family loyalty, {{not to mention the}} realization that life may not align with our idealized expectations". Boston Globe correspondent Peter Keough agreed that the [...] "themes of love and loss, self-sacrifice and self-preservation" [...] are applicable to audiences both in and outside the Orthodox community. John Podhoretz, an editor of The Weekly Standard, was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> [...] "state of grace" [...] featured prominently in Fill the Void, perceiving it to be an uncommon concept in Jewish movies.|$|E
500|$|Morse was {{unfamiliar}} with the show. After watching several House episodes, he was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> show had a strong audience with [...] " [...] a total jerk" [...] as the lead character. It was not until Morse told a few long-time friends about the job offer that their enthusiastic reaction convinced {{him to take the}} role. Katie Jacobs, executive producer of House, was impressed by Morse's performance. In a 2006 TV Guide interview, Morse said that, although he discussed the possibility with House writers, it would be [...] "practically impossible" [...] to get the character to return in any later seasons.|$|E
500|$|Stephen James Walker, {{a writer}} of {{reference}} works on Doctor Who, included an extensive analysis and review of the episode in his [...] "unauthorised guide to Doctor Who's fourth series", Monsters Within. Walker attributed the episode's origin as an allusion to other prominent alternate history works, such as It's a Wonderful Life and Sliding Doors, and applauded {{the mention of the}} Trickster as an [...] "unexpected but welcome cross-franchise reference". He was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> format of a [...] "companion-lite" [...] episode followed by a [...] "Doctor-lite" [...] episode had not been attempted before because he thought it was an [...] "ideal compromise".|$|E

500|$|In {{its first}} season, [...] House [...] ranked twenty-fourth among all {{television}} series {{and was the}} ninth-most popular primetime program among women. Aided by a lead-in from the widely popular American Idol, the following three seasons of the program each {{ranked in the top}} ten among all viewers. House reached its peak Nielsen ratings in its third season, attracting an average of 19.4 million viewers per episode. According to Jacobs, the production team was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> show garnered such a large audience. In its fifth season, the show attracted 12.0 million viewers per episode and slipped to nineteenth place overall. It remained Fox's most popular show other than American Idol.|$|E
500|$|Amused by the raven's comically serious disposition, the man {{asks that}} the bird tell him its name. The raven's only answer is [...] "Nevermore".

The narrator remarks to himself that his [...] "friend" [...] the raven will soon fly out of his life, just as [...] "other friends have flown before" [...] along with his {{previous}} hopes. As if answering, the raven responds again with [...] "Nevermore". The narrator reasons that the bird learned the word [...] "Nevermore" [...] from some [...] "unhappy master" [...] and that it is the only word it knows.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} this claim has been {{difficult}} to pin down with any certainty. John H. McMasters recounted an anecdote about an unnamed Swiss aerodynamicist at a dinner party who performed some rough calculations and concluded, presumably in jest, that according to the equations, bumblebees cannot fly. In later years, McMasters has backed away from this origin, suggesting there could be multiple sources, and the earliest he has found was a reference in the 1934 book [...] by French entomologist Antoine Magnan (1881–1938); they had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found [...] their flight was impossible, but [...] "One shouldn't be <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> results of the calculations don't square with reality".|$|E
