40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new solar shading system consisting of glass lamellas with a reflecting <b>solar</b> <b>control</b> <b>coating.</b> The coating is able to efficiently reduce the solar gain through building facades and at the same time redirect part of the daylight into the back of the room where it is most needed. The shading system has been simulated using IESve/Radiance on daylight conditions for a single cell office. A full-scale model of the shad-ing system has also been tested in SBi’s Daylight Laboratory. Simulations and measurements on the shading system under overcast conditions show a reduction in the daylight factor (DF) close to the facade while the DF is unchanged or even higher in the back of the office. Under sunny sky conditions, the lamellas will normally be turned into a vertical position. In this po-sition, the reflective coating will contribute to reduce the heat load on the office significantly...|$|E
40|$|Energy tariff {{is a major}} cost {{in hotel}} operation. Effective use of energy can reduce {{operational}} expenditures and has important environmental benefits. Solar heat gain particularly through fenestration, contributes to {{a significant proportion of}} the building envelope cooling load. More solar radiation means more total solar heat gain and hence, more cooling requirements and larger electricity consumption for air-conditioning in hot summer. Daylight makes an interior space look more lively and attractive and people expect good natural lighting in their living spaces. Daylight is always accompanied by solar heat gain. Due to the small angle of incidence, direct sunlight can be excessive for east-facing windows in early morning and west-facing windows in late afternoon. To avoid the problems of glare, excessive brightness and thermal discomfort, occupants may block the windows with internal shading devices, resulting in poor daylighting performance, switching on electric light fittings and completely isolating with the outdoor environment. Recent advances in thin film coatings for window glass products provide a means of substantially reducing heat gain without proportionally reducing daylight transmittance. It indicates that cooling energy can be reduced, while people can enjoy more natural light and maintain visual contact with the outside environment. This study presents the optical and energy performances of a <b>solar</b> <b>control</b> film <b>coating</b> installed in a guest room of a three-star hotel located in Hunan Province, China. The findings indicated that solar film coating can cut down cooling load without substantially reduce the indoor daylight illuminance level. Proper solar film coating designs would minimize the building energy expenditures and maintain the visual and thermal comforts...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{the state of the art}} of {{advanced}} <b>solar</b> <b>control</b> devices for buildings, with the comparative evaluation of solar-control systems and with guidelines for the development of new <b>solar</b> <b>control</b> systems. It includes multifunctional systems with building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) and/or building integrated solar thermal (BIST) energy conversion. In order to facilitate and to structure the understanding of <b>solar</b> <b>control</b> systems two multidimensional spaces are introduced: the design space and the evaluation space. The design space contains the design parameters which are to be selected by the designer when <b>solar</b> <b>control</b> devices are to be chosen for specific buildings or when new systems are to be developed, such us the color of the slat of a venetian blind or the fraction of holes (direct transmittance) of a fabric for a roller blind. The evaluation space contains the performance parameters or evaluation criteria, which indicate the design's ability to satisfy the functional and aesthetic requirements, such us passive <b>solar</b> gain <b>control</b> or visual comfort. All the design parameters and evaluation criteria are explained in detail in the paper.

40|$|The {{obstruction}} of solar radiation by <b>solar</b> <b>controls</b> must be balanced with the required daylight contribution. <b>Solar</b> <b>controls</b> {{are characterized by}} the percentage of non-obstructed external radiance. The estimation of this radiance, particularly its diffuse component, depends on the sky radiance distribution used. In this work, we have compared three models (isotropic, CIE clear sky and Perez) before deciding which one is the most suitable for calculating natural light without forgetting the aspect of energy. The incident energy on an aperture where <b>solar</b> <b>control</b> is installed and its daily factor (DF) are the two parameters that have been adopted to analyze the three models. The energy allows us to compare the models and the DF allows us to discuss the weight of {{each part of the}} sky dome for each model.

The test results quantified interior temperature reductions and were used to generate initial conditions for the RadTherm cooldown analysis.
