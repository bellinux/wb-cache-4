50|$|When {{a bridge}} deck is {{installed}} in a through truss, it is sometimes called a floor system. A <b>suspended</b> bridge <b>deck</b> will be <b>suspended</b> from the main structural elements on a suspension or arch bridge.

2500|$|The Tibetan saint and bridge-builder Thangtong Gyalpo {{originated}} {{the use of}} iron chains in {{his version}} of simple suspension bridges. In 1433, Gyalpo built eight bridges in eastern Bhutan. The last surviving chain-linked bridge of Gyalpo's was the Thangtong Gyalpo Bridge in Duksum en route to Trashi Yangtse, which was finally washed away in 2004. Gyalpo's iron chain bridges {{did not include a}} <b>suspended</b> <b>deck</b> bridge which is the standard on [...] all modern suspension bridges today. Instead, both the railing and the walking layer of Gyalpo's bridges used wires. The stress points that carried the screed were reinforced by the iron chains. Before the use of iron chains it is thought that Gyalpo used ropes from twisted willows or yak skins. He may have also used tightly bound cloth.|$|E
5000|$|Development of {{wire cable}} {{suspension}} bridges {{dates to the}} temporary simple suspension bridge at Annonay built by Marc Seguin and his brothers in 1822. It spanned only 18 m.

40|$|In most {{developed}} coastal areas, seawalls protect towns, road, {{rail and}} rural infrastructure against wave overtopping. Similar structures protect port installations worldwide, {{and may be}} used for cliff protection. When a large tidal excursion and severe environmental conditions concur to expose seawalls and vertical face breakwaters to wave impact loading, impulsive loads from breaking waves can be very large. Despite their magnitude, wave impact loads are seldom included in structural analysis of coastal structures and dynamic analysis is rare, leading to designers ignoring short-duration wave loads, perhaps contributing to damage to a range of breakwaters, seawalls and <b>suspended</b> <b>decks.</b> Over the last 10 years, improved awareness of wave-impact induced failures of breakwaters in Europe and Japan has focussed attention on the need to include wave impact loads in the loading assessment, and to conduct dynamic analysis when designing coastal structures. Recent experimental work has focused more strongly on recording and analyzing violent wave impacts. These new data are however only useful if methodologies are available to evaluate dynamic responses of maritime structures to short-duration loads. Improvement...|$|R

5000|$|In some {{contexts}} {{the term}} [...] "simple suspension bridge" [...] refers not {{to this type}} of bridge but rather to a <b>suspended</b> <b>deck</b> bridge that is [...] "simple" [...] in that its deck is not stiffened. [...] Although simple suspension bridges and [...] "simple" [...] <b>suspended</b> <b>deck</b> bridges are similar in many respects, they differ in their physics. On a simple suspension bridge, the main cables (or chains) follow a hyperbolic curve, the catenary. This is because the main cables are free hanging. In contrast, on a <b>suspended</b> <b>deck</b> bridge (whether [...] "simple" [...] or not) the main cables follow a parabolic curve. This is because the main cables are tied at uniform intervals to the bridge deck below (see suspension bridge curve). The differences between these two curves was a question of importance in the 17th century, worked on by Isaac Newton among others.|$|E
50|$|In July 1922, a flood on the Molonglo River {{washed away}} the legs on the trestle bridge, leaving the bridge <b>deck</b> <b>suspended</b> by the rails and sagging into the water. The bridge was never reconstructed and the rails were removed in 1940.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, {{such as the}} Capilano Suspension Bridge, {{the primary}} {{supports}} form the handrails with the <b>deck</b> <b>suspended</b> below them.

50|$|The Brady Street Bridge, {{also known}} as the South 22nd Street Bridge, was a steel tied-arch bridge in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which crossed over the Monongahela River at South 22nd Street. It was {{replaced}} by the Birmingham Bridge in 1976, and was demolished on May 29, 1978. The bridge's main span was a tied arch with a <b>suspended</b> road <b>deck,</b> with two through-truss side spans, carrying two traffic lanes between Brady Street on the Pittsburgh side and South 22nd Street on the south side. Approach viaducts were built at either end. The bridge was built by the Schultz Bridge and Iron Company.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{has three}} spans {{and a total}} length of 270 ft. The two anchor spans are 84 ft long and {{cantilever}} over the piers to support the 102 ft center span, 60 ft of which is <b>suspended.</b> The <b>deck</b> is 56 ft wide and the total width of the bridge is 63.1 ft. The bridge is essentially two separate bridges, {{each with its own}} structure, separated by a 4 ft divider strip and connected by a 1 in joint along the bridge's length. The bridge has two lanes in each direction and the sidewalks are 2.5 ft wide.|$|R
5000|$|The Bollman Bridge is a two-span through-truss, {{resting on}} granite {{abutments}} {{at each end}} and a granite pier {{in the middle of}} the river. The truss structure is a mixture of wrought and cast iron. The truss configuration is the design patented by Bollman as the [...] "Bollman suspension truss" [...] in 1852. Each span is 79.5 ft long, 25.5 ft wide and about 21 ft tall. The Bollman truss <b>suspends</b> the <b>deck</b> from a network of tension members, while the top chord resists compressive forces. The system is therefore referred to as a suspension truss.|$|R
50|$|Made of steel, with {{a length}} of 230 m, a width of 38 m, and a height of 26 m, the <b>suspended</b> <b>deck</b> of the bridge serves to carry a traffic road and a light rail (tram) line.
