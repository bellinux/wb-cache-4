500|$|The bedrock {{underlying}} the mountain {{is composed of}} limestone and dolostone members of the Helderberg Group, laid during the Paleozoic era. Most of the Helderberg carbonates in Rosendale are located north of the Rondout Creek, and have given Rosendale a karst topography, resulting in [...] "sink holes, disappearing streams, caves, and springs". The mountain's surface is composed of unconsolidated, glacially deposited outwash and till, with several outcrops exposing Joppenbergh's bedrock. Soils have been mapped as Farmington-Rock outcrop complex. In some areas, the <b>soil</b> <b>depth</b> is less than , which hinders groundwater filtration.

500|$|Five {{types of}} peat {{appear in the}} Everglades system; each type {{supports}} {{a specific type of}} vegetation, such as sawgrass, tree islands, or custard apple trees. Peat buildup is possible because water prevents oxygen from quickly decomposing plant matter. Once peat buildup reaches the surface, oxygen reacts with the microorganisms to decay the peat rapidly in a process called subsidence. Initial attempts at developing agriculture near Lake Okeechobee were successful, but the nutrients in the peat quickly deteriorated by drying, and were broken down by bacteria in the soil. The dried peat burned or was degraded into carbon dioxide and water by microorganisms. Some homes built near early farms had to restructure their foundations on stilts as the peat deteriorated; other areas lost approximately [...] of <b>soil</b> <b>depth.</b> Between the 1880s and 2005, an estimated 3.4 billion metric tons of soil has been lost in the Everglades due to oxidation.

40|$|Rates {{at which}} {{water can be}} transported along plant roots (axial pathway) vary through time, in part {{depending}} on xylem maturation. Because of experimental constraints, the dynamics of root functional heterogeneity under field conditions remains mostly uncharted territory. Recent advances in mechanistic modelling offer opportunities to bypass such experimental limitations. This paper examines the dynamics of local variations in axial conductance of primary and first-order lateral roots of a maize crop using the architecture-based modelling approach developed by Doussan et al. (Annals of Botany: 81, 213 - 223, 1998). Specifically, we hypothesised that points of major resistance to long distance water transfers could arise from discrepancies between the hydraulic maturity (or water carrying capacity) of main axes and branch roots. To test this assumption, spatial distributions of root axial conductance were tested after 30, 60 and 100 days at <b>soil</b> <b>depths</b> of 10, 50 and 100 cm under a maize (Zea mays L.) crop sown at a density of 8 plants m(- 2). As the crop developed, the corresponding root populations encompassed ever increasing amounts of hydraulically mature first-order laterals (branch roots) : after a 100 -day growth period, {{the vast majority of}} laterals had reached their maximum axial conductance at all <b>soil</b> <b>depths</b> down to 100 cm. In contrast, the axial conductance of a large proportion of main axes (primary roots) remained low, even at shallow <b>soil</b> <b>depths</b> and after 100 days of growth. The imbalance between the hydraulic maturity of primary and lateral roots was most conspicuous at <b>soil</b> <b>depths</b> of 100 cm, where similar to 10 % only of the former compared to similar to 80 % of the latter, had reached their maximum axial conductance after a 100 -day growth period...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) efflux {{from the}} soil surface, which is {{a major source of}} CO 2 from {{terrestrial}} ecosystems, represents the total CO 2 production at all <b>soil</b> <b>depths.</b> Although many studies have estimated the vertical profile of the CO 2 production rate, one of the difficulties in estimating the vertical profile is measuring diffusion coefficients of CO 2 at all <b>soil</b> <b>depths</b> in a nondestructive manner. In this study, we estimated the temporal variation in the vertical profile of the CO 2 production rate using a data assimilation method, the particle filtering method, in which the diffusion coefficients of CO 2 were simultaneously estimated. The CO 2 concentrations at several <b>soil</b> <b>depths</b> and CO 2 efflux {{from the soil}} surface (only during the snow-free period) were measured at two points in a broadleaf forest in Japan, and the data were assimilated into a simple model including a diffusion equation. We found that there were large variations in the pattern of the vertical profile of the CO 2 production rate between experiment sites: the peak CO 2 production rate was at <b>soil</b> <b>depths</b> around 10 cm during the snow-free period at one site, but the peak was at the soil surface at the other site. Using this method to estimate the CO 2 production rate during snow-cover periods allowed us to estimate CO 2 efflux during that period as well. We estimated that the CO 2 efflux during the snow-cover period (about half the year) accounted for around 13 % of the annual CO 2 efflux at this site. Although the method proposed in this study does not ensure the validity of the estimated diffusion coefficients and CO 2 production rates, the method enables us to more closely approach the "actual" values by decreasing the variance of the posterior distribution of the values...|$|R
