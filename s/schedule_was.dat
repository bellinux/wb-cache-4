40|$|Window {{decoding}} <b>schedules</b> <b>are</b> {{very attractive}} for message passing decoding of spatially coupled LDPC codes. They {{take advantage of}} the inherent convolutional code structure and allow continuous transmission with low decoding latency and complexity. In this paper we show that the decoding complexity can be further reduced if suitable message passing <b>schedules</b> <b>are</b> applied within the decoding window. An improvement based <b>schedule</b> <b>is</b> presented that easily adapts to different ensemble structures, window sizes, and channel parameters. Its combination with a serial (on-demand) <b>schedule</b> <b>is</b> also considered. Results from a computer search based <b>schedule</b> <b>are</b> shown for comparison...|$|R

5|$|In July 2009, {{the policy}} of {{time-based}} development freezes on a two-year cycle was announced.

In September 2010, the backports service became official, providing more recent versions of some software for the stable release.|$|E
5|$|In early 1964, David Warburton of Roberts & Vinter, an {{established}} publisher, {{heard from the}} printer of Science Fantasy and New Worlds that the magazines were going to fold shortly. Warburton decided that having a respectable magazine would help him in getting good distribution for Roberts & Vinter's books: Science Fantasy and New Worlds both had distribution arrangements with the two main British newsagents of the time, John Menzies and W.H. Smith. Carnell {{did not want to}} continue to edit the magazines in addition to New Writings in SF, and recommended Moorcock to Warburton; Kyril Bonfiglioli, an Oxford art dealer who was a friend of Brian Aldiss, also expressed an interest. Warburton gave Moorcock the choice of which magazine to edit; Moorcock chose New Worlds, and Bonfiglioli became the new editor of Science Fantasy. Roberts & Vinter changed the format from digest to paperback, and the first issue under Bonfiglioli's control was number 65, dated June–July 1964. The <b>schedule</b> <b>was</b> initially somewhat irregular, with each issue dated with two months even when two issues were only a month apart—for example, June–July 1964 was followed by July–August 1964. From March 1965 a regular monthly <b>schedule</b> <b>was</b> begun.|$|E
50|$|During 1962-1963 year, a {{flexible}} form of individualized <b>scheduling</b> <b>was</b> introduced, and block <b>scheduling</b> <b>was</b> eliminated. Also, a reading consultant was provided for 3 {{days a week}} for additional help.|$|R
50|$|Another {{variation}} of the 24-hour shift <b>schedule</b> <b>is</b> a 4-platoon system, averaging 42 hours/week. Thus, the <b>schedule</b> <b>is</b> 24 on, 48 off, 24 on, 96 off, on a 4-day rotation.|$|R

5|$|Keogh {{became the}} star of the tour, and played in at least 60 of the side's 74 matches in the British Isles. The <b>schedule</b> <b>was</b> grueling, with their matches played in only 175 days.

In December the team played two internationals, against Ireland and Wales, with Keogh appearing in both.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} 7 June 2013. Scenes focusing on Chaitanya and Samantha were shot at Narayanguda in mid June 2013. The latter completed her {{part in the}} schedule and left for Switzerland on 18 June 2013 to work on Attarintiki Daredi (2013). The first <b>schedule</b> <b>was</b> wrapped up by late June 2013 and the second <b>schedule</b> <b>was</b> scheduled to begin in mid-July 2013. Some important scenes were planned to be shot in that schedule. Shriya Saran joined the film's sets in late July 2013. Samantha tweeted on 31 July 2013 that the film's second schedule had been wrapped up. The film was shot in Hyderabad Campus of Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani in late August 2013 and Samantha rejoined the film's sets on 1 September 2013 after completing Ramayya Vasthavayya (2013).|$|E
