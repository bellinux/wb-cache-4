40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the reduction of}} critical spin-transfer torque (STT) <b>switching</b> <b>currents</b> in Co-Fe-B/MgO based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) with perpendicular magnetization anisotropy (PMA). The junctions yield tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratios of up to 64 % at 4 monolayer (ML) tunnel barrier thickness. In this paper, {{the reduction of the}} critical <b>switching</b> <b>current</b> density is studied. By optimizing the applied bias field during DC-STT measurements, ultra low critical <b>switching</b> <b>current</b> densities of less than 20 kA/cm$^ 2 $, even down to 9 kA/cm$^ 2 $, are found.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{theoretical}} model of magnetization switching in a ferromagnetic multilayer by both electric current and microwaves. The electric current gives a spin transfer torque on the magnetization, while the microwaves induce a precession of the magnetization around the initial state. Based on numerical simulation of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, {{it is found}} that the <b>switching</b> <b>current</b> is significantly reduced compared with the switching caused solely by the spin transfer torque when the microwave frequency is in a certain range. We develop a theory of switching from the LLG equation averaged over a constant energy curve. It was found that the <b>switching</b> <b>current</b> should be classified into four regions, depending on the values of the microwave frequency. Based on the analysis, we derive an analytical formula of the optimized frequency minimizing the <b>switching</b> <b>current,</b> which is smaller than the ferromagnetic resonance frequency. We also derive an analytical formula of the minimized <b>switching</b> <b>current.</b> Both the optimized frequency and the minimized <b>switching</b> <b>current</b> decrease with increasing the amplitude of the microwave field. The results will be useful to achieve high thermal stability and low <b>switching</b> <b>current</b> in spin torque systems simultaneously. Comment: 18 pages, 13 figures, publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dependence of}} the <b>switching</b> <b>current</b> density on the exchange stiffness constant in the spin transfer torque magnetic tunneling junction structure with micromagnetic simulations. Since the widely accepted analytic expression of the <b>switching</b> <b>current</b> density {{is based on the}} macro-spin model, there is no dependence of the exchange stiffness constant. When the switching is occurred, however, the spin configuration forms C-, S-type, or complicated domain structures. Since the spin configuration is determined by the shape anisotropy and the exchange stiffness constant, the <b>switching</b> <b>current</b> density is very sensitive on their variations. It implies that there are more rooms for the optimization of the <b>switching</b> <b>current</b> density with by controlling the exchange stiffness constant, which is determined by composition and the detail fabrication processes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{systematic}} approach {{for the design}} of <b>Switched</b> <b>Current</b> (SI) ladder filters is described. The specifications of the filter in z-domain are used to obtain continued fraction expansions (CFE). Signal Flow Graphs (SFG) of each row of the expansion is derived and then these SFG are directly transformed into <b>switched</b> <b>current</b> structures (integrators and amplifiers). The SI blocks thus obtained are connected in ladder form to generate the required SI filter circuit. This approach can be used for all filter types.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of CMOS VLSI circuit <b>switching</b> <b>current</b> {{has become an}} increasingly important and difficult task from both a VLSI design and simulation software perspective. This paper presents a new static <b>switching</b> <b>current</b> estimation algorithm {{based on the idea}} of “Expected Current Distributions ” (ECDs). Unlike previ-ous “expected waveform ” approaches, ECDs model not only the expected value of <b>switching</b> <b>current</b> waveforms over all time, but also the variances and covariances of all waveform segments as well. This extra information allows a <b>switching</b> <b>current</b> waveform to be modeled by a random process with both first and second order ensemble statistics. This specification provides the power spectral density of the <b>switching</b> <b>current</b> and allows the use of tra-ditional frequency domain noise analysis to simulate the behavior of the <b>switching</b> <b>current</b> in the electrical supply network. An ECD simulation procedure is described and results are presented for the ISCAS 85 combinational benchmark circuits. Estimated quantities include total average and RMS VDD current, the autocorrelation function of the total VDD current waveform, and per-gate average and RMS VDD currents. The results show speedups of up to 100 x and good agreement with respect to figures obtained using dynamic logic simulation and statistical mean estimation. 1...|$|R

The power consumption for a near-Nyquist output signal sampled at 1. 6 GS/s equals 27 mW. To enable the presented performance a design strategy is proposed that introduces a switch-driver power consumption aware analysis of the <b>switched</b> <b>current</b> cell.

While realizing the clock-jitter insensitivity, this technique ensures that the feedback period can be utilized more efficiently so that the amplitude of feedback current can be reduced. The proposed technique employs simple digital elements to generate a fixed-pulse-width feedback control clock. It was verified in a 2 nd order, 1 -bit CT ΣΔ modulator with SI RZ feedback. Simulation result shows that the clock-jitter tolerance using the proposed technique is up to 2 % of a clock cycle with SNDR larger than 62 dB.
