50|$|We {{showed how}} to <b>superimpose</b> two shapes. The same method {{can be applied}} to <b>superimpose</b> a set of three or more shapes, as far as the above {{mentioned}} reference orientation is used for all of them. However, Generalized Procrustes analysis provides a better method to achieve this goal.|$|R
