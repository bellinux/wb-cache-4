40|$|Abstract — This paper {{demonstrates}} a method which enables users {{to control their}} <b>LAN</b> <b>network</b> from remote place using a cell phone-based interface. To manage and monitor the control activities of network, the user should send an authentication SMS along with the required/desired function/action SMS to his/her server system via Global System for Mobile communication (GSM). Upon being properly authenticated, the cell phone-based interface would relay the commands to a server system that would perform the required function/action, and return a function completion SMS that {{would be sent to}} the administrator (user’s cell phone). II. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION This system can be developed in two ways. First one is that the targeted <b>LAN</b> <b>network</b> can be controlled by sending SMS sent by user.
