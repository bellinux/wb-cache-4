5|$|Eisenhower favored Shoup {{because he}} feared other {{officers}} <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> {{much time in}} political affairs, and felt Shoup would reduce {{the influence of the}} military industrial complex. Immediately after his appointment, Shoup sought to place new officers in key positions, in an attempt to overhaul the leadership of the Marine Corps. He and Pate disagreed over some of the new appointments, as Shoup transferred many senior officers and encouraged others to retire. Shoup later wrote he felt the Joint Chiefs of Staff had an undue weight in the direction of military strategy. He also sought to curtail politicking by lower-level Marine officers seeking career advancement.|$|E
5|$|Christian Donlan of Eurogamer was {{surprised}} by the long length of the game and the amount of variety it offered given its simple premise. He enjoyed the game's pacing and felt that separating puzzles into short levels kept the game fun. Game Informer reviewer Kyle Hilliard also approved of the game's pacing. He remarked that BoxBoy!s low price and well-designed puzzles made it entirely worth playing. VentureBeat writer Gavin Greene agreed that the game offered a lot of content at an inexpensive price. The game's structure did draw some criticism from Jon Wahlgren, writing for Nintendo Life. He thought the game <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> much time teaching new mechanics and did not give players enough freedom to explore or experiment; as a result he believed the game felt restricted.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the artifact, Shepard has {{a vision of the}} Reaper fleet approaching. Kenson and her entire team, however, turn out to have been indoctrinated from having <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> much time studying the artifact. She attacks Shepard, who is eventually overwhelmed by her soldiers. Upon awakening two days later, Shepard manages to escape and reach the control room, where he/she sets the asteroid on course to hit the Bahak system's relay. In retaliation, Kenson plans to destroy the asteroid by overloading the reactor core of the facility, but Shepard ultimately stops her. Shepard then contacts his/her starship and escapes shortly before the asteroid hits the Relay, resulting in the destruction of the entire Bahak system. Shepard is later met by Admiral Steven Hackett, their superior officer, who explains that he/she has to go to Earth and face the consequences, setting the stage for Mass Effect 3.|$|E

50|$|She studied {{painting}} under John Opie and was {{the only}} female student that he taught. He painted her portrait between 1790 and 1800. Using a painting made by Opie, Read painted a portrait of Dr. Priestly. They {{may have had a}} romantic relationship. It was a concern of her uncle, Rev. William Betham (1749-1839) who warned Isabella about Jane and Opie <b>spenting</b> <b>too</b> much time together. His comments soured William's relationship with the Beetham's. Opie's wife, the former Mary Bunn, ran off with another man and the Opies were divorced on December 23, 1796. Opie was adamantly rejected when he asked Edward Beetham if he could marry Jane. Soon after, Jane married John Read.|$|R

5|$|Mushishi {{opens with}} Yoki {{and his mother}} walking along a {{mountain}} when a cliff suddenly collapses. This {{is followed by a}} nonlinear narrative that moves between the past and the present. A series of flashbacks reveal that only Yoki survived, coming under the care of Nui, who is a Mushishi (or Bugmaster)—an expert in Mushi, which are supernatural bug-like creatures that are invisible to most humans. She lives near a pond where {{there are two types of}} Mushi: a fish-like Ginko who swims in the darkness-like Tokoyami. Because Nui <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> long looking at the Ginko, one of her eyes and the color of her hair were altered by the shadow of Tokoyami. Eventually, Nui is swallowed by the Tokoyami. When Yoki tries to help her, he is also swallowed. Only by sacrificing one of his eyes and his memories is Yoki able to survive. He then renames himself Ginko because it is the only name he can remember.|$|E
5|$|Clough was {{appointed}} as manager at Third Division Brighton & Hove Albion on 1 November 1973, with Taylor joining as his assistant. Just after the pair were appointed, the team lost 4–0 {{at home to}} Walton & Hersham in an FA Cup replay and then 8–2 at home to Bristol Rovers on 1 December. Brighton finished 19th in the final table in the 1973–74 season, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Fourth Division, and the pair began to rebuild the team by signing Peter Grummitt, Andy Rollings, Ian Mellor, Steve Govier, and Ken Goodewe; Taylor felt that Clough never settled at Brighton however, and <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> much time away on media commitments. Clough left for Leeds United in July 1974, but Taylor refused to go with Clough as he felt Brighton and club chairman Mike Bamber had treated them well, and so the partnership ended after nine years as Taylor stayed at the Goldstone Ground as sole manager. He went on to sign striker Peter Ward and midfielder Brian Horton, but admitted that both he and Clough were much more effective as a duo; {{he felt that he}} had struggled to make the good players he signed play to their full potential whilst feeling that Clough had bought and sold poorly as Leeds manager. He stayed on at the South coast club for a further two seasons, guiding the team to a fourth-place finish in 1975–76, missing promotion by two points. His successor, Alan Mullery, managed to lead the team Taylor left behind to promotion in 1976–77 and then into the top-flight in 1978–79.|$|E
25|$|While Lord Sugar {{indicated}} that he thought Andrew should have been brought back into the boardroom instead of Navdeep, since the cakes he baked were deemed to be unimpressive, Navdeep was warned that she had <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> {{much time in the}} background, and needed to step up in the following task.|$|E
50|$|In the 1790, Paxton {{stood as}} a Whig party {{candidate}} in the Newark-on-Trent constituency, to become junior to the Duke of Portland. Winning by 72 votes, his opponents contested the result, and finding that Paxton had <b>spent</b> far <b>too</b> prodigiously, he was dismissed.|$|R

25|$|Robertson {{later came}} out to Beauvais in March 1917 to demand that Wilson keep him fully {{informed}} of all developments. On {{a visit to the}} Italian Front in March 1917 Robertson was unimpressed by the “white faces and white hands” of many Italian officers, which suggested that they <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> much time at headquarters and not enough time visiting the front lines.|$|E
25|$|Barbaro was {{the last}} Venetian {{ambassador}} to leave Persia, after Uzun Hassan died in 1478. By this point only one of Barbaro's entourage was left. While Hassan's sons fought {{each other for the}} throne, Barbaro hired an Armenian guide and escaped by way of Erzerum, Aleppo, and Beirut. Barbaro reached Venice in 1479, where he defended himself against complaints that he had <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> much time in Cyprus before going to Persia. Barbaro's report included not just political and military matters, but discussed Persian agriculture, commerce, and customs.|$|E
25|$|Reed {{competed in}} (and {{was the first}} wrestler {{eliminated}} from) the first Royal Rumble match in January 1988. Two months later, he was eliminated {{in the first round}} of the WrestleMania IV championship tournament in the first round by eventual tournament winner Randy Savage. Reed dominated most of the match against Savage, but <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> much time mouthing off to Savage's manager (and real life wife) Miss Elizabeth while climbing to the top turnbuckle. Savage caught Reed, threw him off for a slam and immediately hit his Diving elbow drop off the top turnbuckle for the win.|$|E

25|$|The Polish nobles {{were unhappy}} that their new king <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> {{much time on}} Lithuanian affairs. It {{was clear that the}} war could {{continue}} for years and would not bring any benefit to Poland. In 1392, Władysław sent Henry of Masovia with an offer to make Vytautas regent instead of Skirgaila. Vytautas accepted and again broke with the Order. He burned three Teutonic castles and returned to Vilnius. Jagiełło and Vytautas signed the Astrava Treaty in which Vytautas recovered all Kęstutis' lands, including Trakai, and was given more. Vytautas would rule Lithuania in the name of Władysław. After Vytautas' death, all his lands and powers would revert to Władysław.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012 and January 2013, faculty {{hiring and}} salary issues became a {{controversial}} issue. The university's draft Academic Plan, issued that fall, drew {{a number of}} criticisms. Commenters said the university was not hiring enough experienced research faculty, <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> much money hiring assistant faculty (those just beginnings their careers), and was not paying faculty at all levels well enough. The academic plan did not address these issues, they said. A quarter of MSU's full-time faculty attended a meeting with Cruzado in January 2013 in which similar sentiments were expressed. Some faculty at the meeting also accused Cruzado of failing to fill faculty vacancies quickly enough.|$|E
25|$|Four men, {{including}} Baker, {{announced their}} candidacy for the November special election {{to fill the}} remainder of Reynolds' term. The other candidates included Kentucky Court of Appeals Justices John Miller and Joseph Huddleston and William S. Cooper. Baker {{finished third in the}} special election with 30,278 votes; Cooper won the seat, garnering 33,670 votes to Huddleston's 32,137 and Miller's 26,592. Each candidate won by a large margin in his home county, but Baker, from Barren County, cut into Huddleston's margin in neighboring Warren County, while low overall voter turnout in Daviess County hurt Miller. During the campaign, fellow justice Joseph Lambert told Baker that he <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> much time writing opinions and not enough time campaigning.|$|E

25|$|At {{least one}} well-regarded {{political}} analyst (published by Foreign Policy and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty) said that {{conditions in the}} Central Asian republic of Turkmenistan were similar enough to those in countries currently experiencing protests and revolts that the autocratic government of President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov appears worried by the precedent of revolutions in North Africa and major political concessions in several Western Asian states. Berdimuhamedov's regime has censored all news of the protests and governmental changes. There have also been some credible reports of Turkmenistani authorities attempting {{to keep tabs on}} all citizens {{both inside and outside the}} country, with Turkmenistanis whom the government judges to have <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> much time abroad allegedly warned they could be barred either from returning to their home country, or from leaving again once they do return.|$|E
25|$|Forest Grove {{started a}} {{volunteer}} fire department on February 4, 1894, with {{combination of two}} fire companies. The department was created after bucket brigades were determined to be inefficient, and the two fire companies <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> much time fighting each other. One of the first chiefs was J. G. Lenneville, who was first elected to the post in 1901, and served through at least 1923. In December 1907, the city purchased a hose wagon for $100. The city replaced the fire bell that had been housed at a church and at the Old College Hall at Pacific University with an electric siren in October 1925. A 1907 steamer used by the Portland Fire Bureau was bought by Forest Grove in 1933 for $150, and is still owned by the fire department.|$|E
25|$|In {{the future}} storyline where the Sentinels exterminated most mutants {{and went on}} to kill regular humans as well, the elderly Magneto allies with the X-Men's {{remnants}} in a monastery in China. He and Professor Xavier decide that the best solution would be to prevent the Sentinels' creation by stopping Mystique's assassination of Bolivar Trask in 1973. Wolverine's consciousness is sent back to his past self by Kitty Pryde, and his past actions occur simultaneously to an incoming Sentinel attack on the mutant hideout. Magneto destroys many Sentinels by hurling the Blackbird at them but ends up impaled by a stray fragment from a destroyed Sentinel. Retreating into the monastery, Magneto starts to succumb to his wound as he tells Charles he regrets that both friends <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> many years fighting among themselves rather than seeing eye-to-eye. He remains there until the Sentinels infiltrate the stronghold right as young Xavier and Wolverine have successfully changed the future.|$|E

25|$|Task Review: Renaissance decided upon an Italian theme, but <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> {{long with}} their brand and pricing for the themed {{day that they}} could not buy from the wholesalers, thus forced to buy from {{elsewhere}} and resulting in increased food costs. Although their income was high and their services smoothed out after a shaky start, the team suffered from a lack of supplies that resorted to them cutting prices in half on their pizzas, with their expenditure being much higher due to their high cost overruns. Meanwhile, Alpha chose a Bollywood theme, yet while they managed to arrange all their printing for free, they were forced to cancel their lunch service due to the food not being prepared properly. They soon turned things around by focusing on a sales strategy of selling admission tickets for £5 that were redeemable against dinner, which proved to be a decisive idea as they secured a healthy profit, even before they had served a meal.|$|E
25|$|Like most {{industrialists}} of his era, Roach was staunchly anti-union, {{and insisted}} his employees negotiate {{on an individual}} basis for their wages. Roach however, took the concept of individual negotiation much further than most of his contemporaries. Instead of paying a set wage to workers based on their qualifications or skill, he organized a sliding scale of wages for each group, based on a set of criteria Roach himself deemed important. A worker who met all the criteria would receive the top rate, while those who did not would have their wages progressively reduced, depending on the number of criteria they failed. Criteria for payment included not only a worker's skill level, but his punctuality, dependability, eagerness and quality of work, in addition to which his moral character was subject to assessment. Workers who <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> much on alcohol, who paid their rent erratically, whose families were poorly clothed, or whose children did not attend church or school, could expect to have their wages reduced still further.|$|E

About the move, Lester said, [...] "I <b>spent</b> <b>too</b> long treating college players nice and making sure they were happy... I don't have to do that now. I can coach here.
