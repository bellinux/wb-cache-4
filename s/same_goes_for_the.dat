The <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> experience of reading a single line of Homer.

B. N.

25|$|The {{time of the}} Fifth Dalai Lama, who reigned from 1642 to 1682 {{and founded}} the {{government}} known as the Ganden Phodrang, {{was a period of}} rich cultural development. His reign and that of Desi Sangye Gyatso are noteworthy for the upsurge in literary activity and of cultural and economic life that occurred. The <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> great {{increase in the number of}} foreign visitors thronging Lhasa during the period as well as for the number of inventions and institutions that are attributed to the 'Great Fifth', as the Tibetans refer to him. The most dynamic and prolific of the early Dalai Lamas, he composed more literary works than all the other Dalai Lamas combined. Writing on a wide variety of subjects he is specially noted for his works on history, classical Indian poetry in Sanskrit and his biographies of notable personalities of his epoch, as well as his own two autobiographies, one spiritual in nature and the other political (see Further Reading). He also taught and travelled extensively, reshaped the politics of Central Asia, unified Tibet, conceived and constructed the Potala Palace and is remembered for establishing systems of national medical care and education.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} persimmon fruit needs frost to ripen and soften, called bletting. Some, such as the early-ripening varieties [...] "pieper" [...] and [...] "NC21"(also known as [...] "supersweet"), easily lose astringency and become completely free of it when slightly soft at the touch—these are then very sweet, even in the British climate. On the other hand, some varieties (like the very large fruited [...] "yates", which is a late ripening variety) remain astringent even when the fruit has become completely soft (at least in the British climate). Frost, however, destroys the cells within the fruit, causing it to rot instead of ripen. Only completely ripe and soft fruit can stand some frost; it will then dry and become even sweeter (hence the misconception). The <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Oriental persimmon (Diospyros kaki), where early frost can severely damage a fruit crop.|$|E
2500|$|Perón {{sought out}} other Jewish Argentines as {{government}} advisers, besides Ber Gelbard. The powerful Secretary of Media, Raúl Apold, also Jewish, was called [...] "Perón's Goebbels."

Also, he named Rabbi Amran Blum as the first Jewish professor of philosophy in the National University of Buenos Aires. After Argentina became the first Latin American government to acknowledge the State of Israel, Perón appointed Pablo Mangel, a Jewish man, as ambassador to that country. Education and Diplomacy were the two strongholds of Catholic nationalism, and both appointments were highly symbolic. The <b>same</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1946 decision of allowing Jewish army privates to celebrate their holidays, which was intended to foster Jewish integration in another traditionally Catholic institution, the army.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the harsh}} {{extremes}} in temperature on the Indian Subcontinent, the sari fills a practical role {{as well as}} a decorative one. It is not only warming in winter and cooling in summer, but its loose-fitting tailoring is preferred by women who must be free to move as their duties require. For this reason, it is the clothing of choice of air hostesses on Air India. This led to a professional style of draping a sari which is referred to [...] "Air-Hostess style sari". An air hostess style sari is tied in just the same way as a normal sari except that the pleats are held together quite nicely with the help of pins. A bordered sari will be just perfect for an Air-Hostess style drape where the pallu is heavily pleated and pinned on the shoulder. Even the vertical pleats that are tucked at the navel are severely pleated and pressed. <b>Same</b> <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pallu pleats that are pinned at the shoulder. To get the perfect [...] "Air-hostess" [...] a complimentary U-shaped blouse that covers the upper body completely is worn which gives a very elegant and formal look. Mastering the [...] "Air-hostess" [...] style drape helps to create the desired impact in a formal setting like an interview or a conference.|$|E

50|$|Other {{theories}} easily {{yielding to}} monolithic thought {{stem from the}} emancipation movements of oppressed groups.

As Andrew Ross argues, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> remark <b>goes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> widely accepted account of rock history as a continuous appropriation of black music by a white music industry. Only studies analyzing the cultural oppression of homosexuality seem to take a less deterministic position.|$|R
