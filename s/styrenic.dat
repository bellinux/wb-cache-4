50|$|The {{tests on}} the fire {{behaviour}} of materials with different flame retardants revealed that halogen free flame retardants produce less smoke and toxic fire emissions, {{with the exception of}} the aryl phosphates RDP and BDP in <b>styrenic</b> polymers. The leaching experiments showed that the nature of the polymer is a dominating factor and that the leaching behaviour of halogen free and brominated flame retardants is comparable. The more porous or “hydrophilic” a polymers is the more flame retardants can be released. However, moulded plates which represent real world plastic products showed much lower leaching levels than extruded polymer granules. The impact assessment studies reconfirmed that the improper waste and recycling treatment of electronic products with brominated flame retardants can produce dioxins which is not the case with halogen free alternatives. Furthermore, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) has been carrying out a series of projects related to the environmental assessment of alternative flame retardants, the “design for environment” projects on flame retardants for printed wiring boards and alternatives to decabromo diphenylethers and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD).|$|E
5000|$|In ionic curing process, an ionic photoinitiator {{is used to}} {{activate}} the functional group of the oligomers {{that are going to}} participate in cross-linking. Typically photopolymerization is a very selective process and it is crucial that the polymerization takes place only where it is desired to do so. In order to satisfy this liquid neat oligomer can be doped with either anionic or cationic photoinitiators that will initiate polymerization only when radiated with light. Monomers, or functional groups, employed in cationic photopolymerization include: <b>styrenic</b> compounds, vinyl ethers, N-vinyl carbazoles, lactones, lactams, cyclic ethers, cyclic acetals, and cyclic siloxanes. The majority of ionic photoinitiators fall under the cationic class, anionic photoinitiators are considerably less investigated. [...] There are several classes of cationic initiators including: Onium salts, organometallic compounds and pyridinium salts. [...] As mentioned earlier, one of the drawbacks of the photoinitiators used for photopolymerization is that they tend to absorb in the short UV region. [...] Photosensitizers, or chromophores, that absorb in a much longer wavelength region can be employed to excite the photoinitiators through an energy transfer. [...] Other modifications to these types of systems are free radical assisted cationic polymerization. In this case, a free radical is formed from another specie in solution that reacts with the photoinitiator in order to start polymerization. Although there are a diverse group of compounds activated by cationic photoinitiators, the compounds that find most industrial uses contain epoxides, oxetanes, and vinyl ethers. One of the advantages to using cationic photopolymerization is that once the polymerization has begun it is no longer sensitive to oxygen and does not require an inert atmosphere to perform well.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Synthetic {{strategies}} for the preparation of a new family of vinyl mono-mers, 4 -vinyl- 1, 2, 3 -triazoles, have been developed. These monomers are noteworthy as they combine the stability and aromaticity of <b>styrenics</b> with the polarity of vinyl-pyridines and the structural versatility of acrylate/methacrylate derivatives. To ena-ble the wide adoption of these unique monomers, new methodologies for their synthe-sis have been elaborated which rely on Cu-catalyzed azide/acetylene cycloaddition reactions—‘‘click chemistry’’—as the key step, with the vinyl substituent being formed by either elimination or Wittig-type reactions. In addition, one-pot ‘‘click’’ reactions have been developed from alkyl halides, which allow for monomer synthesis without isolation of the intermediate organic azides. The high yield and facile nature of these procedures has allowed a library of new monomers including the parent com-pound, 1 -H- 4 -vinyl- 1, 2, 3 -triazole, to be prepared on large scales.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The growing demand in portable and compact consumer devices and appliances {{has resulted in the}} need for the miniaturisation of electronic components. These miniaturised electronic components are sensitive and susceptible to damage by voltages as low as 20 V. Electrically conductive <b>styrenic</b> thermoplastics are widely used in electronic packaging applications to protect these sensitive electronic components against electro-static discharge (ESD) during manufacturing, assembly, storage and shipping. Such ESD applications often require the optimal volume resistance range of ≥ 1. 0 x 105 to < 1. 0 x 108 Ω. The best known method to render <b>styrenic</b> thermoplastics conductive is by the incorporation of conductive fillers, such as carbon black but the main limitation is the difficulty in controlling the conductivity level due to the steep percolation curve. Thus the aim of this research is to develop electrically conductive <b>styrenic</b> thermoplastics by blending several <b>styrenic</b> resins with polymeric conductive additives to achieve optimal volume resistance range for ESD applications with the ease in controlling the conductivity level.

40|$|Dielectric Elastomers (Des) are {{deformable}} dielectrics, {{which can}} be used as active materials in mechatronic transducers, such as actuators, sensors and generators. Focusing on actuation systems, several kinds of DE actuators have been proposed in the literature, being characterized by various shapes/sizes and disparate performances in terms of efficiency, force/power densities and reliability. In any case, up to date, these devices are mostly based on either silicone or acrylic elastomers.

In this paper, a lozenge-shaped DE actuator based on <b>styrenic</b> rubber is proposed and its performance are compared to similar DE actuators based on acrylic elastomers.

40|$|Some new {{examples}} of favorable interactions between additives in flame retardant formulations have been found.

Interrogation of the internal structure of the microparticles reveals an array of nanoscale morphologies, including multilayered, curved cylindrical, and spherical domains.

The Dead Sea Bromine Group has addressed these topics and has undertaken several programs to provide the market with useful data showing the good contribution of brominated flame retardants in everyday life. These projects have been undertaken on flame retarded grades of plastics such as high impact polystyrene (HIPS), ABS and PBT. The outcome is showing that brominated flame retardant and plastics containing them pose no risk to the health of the general population from exposure. Environmental studies already made show that brominated flame retardants are not a threat against the environment. Moreover, analyses performed show that the brominated flame retardants are in full compliance with the requirements of the German (Dioxin) Ordinance and EPA TSCA 40 766. 25 Final Rule requirements and pose no risk in matter of brominated dioxins and dibenzofurans. Finally, plastics (such as polyester and <b>styrenics)</b> containing brominated flame retardants are also easily recyclable, able to withstand at least five recycling cycles.

50|$|There {{have been}} three {{distinct}} phases of Ineos's growth. The first spanned over ten years, with Ineos acquiring 22 companies between 1998 and 2008. The most notable of these was the purchase of Innovene, the olefins and derivatives and refining subsidiary of BP, in October 2005 for $9 billion and ICI’s commodity chemicals business in 2001. The second phase between 2008 and 2010 saw a period of consolidation as the company tackled {{the impact of the}} global recession. As production of consumer goods, cars and construction fell during this period, the company saw sales and earnings reduce. During this period a major competitor LyondellBasell filed for bankruptcy. Some predicted a similar fate for Ineos but the company emerged from this period intact. Since 2011 the company has continued to grow through a series of strategic Joint Ventures, the largest of which was formed with PetroChina, combining Ineos’s Refining interests at Grangemouth, in Scotland, and Lavéra, in France, with PetroChina’s access to upstream raw materials.
