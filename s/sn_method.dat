Despite its many undisputable advantages, the <b>Sn</b> <b>method</b> has one important drawback: because the discrete angular directions of the Sn angular quadrature are fixed in space, it generates significant spurious intensity variations when certain target areas “see ” bright emitting spots at relatively small solid angles — the so called “ray effect ” [3]. The ray effect, inherent in the RALEF- 2 D code, is vividly illustrated in Fig. 1 as the angular (azimuthal) variation of the radiation energy density in an empty cylindrical cavity R 1 < r < R 2 = 4 R 1 above a hot and opaque central radiation source of radius R 1 = 1, in which a constant value Bν = B 0 of the source function was assumed.

40|$|The Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) is a multi-dimensional integro-differential equation. It is {{difficult}} to obtain an exact analytical solution to the RTE even for simple one-dimensional cases due of its directional nature.

40|$|Abstract — Time {{multiplexing}} (TM) {{and spatial}} neighborhood (SN) are two mainstream structured light techniques widely used for depth sensing. The former {{is well known}} for its high accuracy and the latter for its low delay. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm of scalable depth sensing to integrate the advantages of both the TM and <b>SN</b> <b>methods.</b> Our contribution is twofold. First, we design a set of hybrid structured light patterns composed of phase-shifted fringe and pseudo-random speckle. Under the illumination of the hybrid patterns, depth can be decently reconstructed either from a few consecutive frames with the TM principle for static scenes or from a single frame with the SN principle for dynamic scenes. Second, we propose a scene-adaptive depth sensing framework based on which a global or region-wise optimal depth map can be generated through motion detection. To validate the proposed scalable paradigm, we develop a real-time (20 fps) depth sensing system. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an efficient balance between accuracy and speed during depth sensing that has rarely been exploited before.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{characteristics}} (MOC) has been favored for many recent whole core transport codes; some current research codes are: the nTRACER code from Seoul National University, the MPACT code from the University of Michigan, and the Dragon code from Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal. However, it is well-known that whole core transport with MOC is both computational expensive and requires significant storage. On the other hand, discrete ordinates (<b>SN)</b> <b>methods</b> have been successfully applied to large systems, as has been demonstrated by the computer code Attila.
