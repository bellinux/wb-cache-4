40|$|We use the SmallGroups Library to {{find the}} finite <b>subgroups</b> <b>of</b> U(3) of order smaller than 512 which possess a {{faithful}} three-dimensional irreducible representation. From the resulting list of groups we extract those groups {{that can not be}} written as direct products with cyclic groups. These groups are the basic building blocks for models based on finite <b>subgroups</b> <b>of</b> U(3). All resulting finite <b>subgroups</b> <b>of</b> SU(3) can be identified using the well known list <b>of</b> finite <b>subgroups</b> <b>of</b> SU(3) derived by Miller, Blichfeldt and Dickson {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century. Furthermore we prove a theorem which allows to construct infinite series <b>of</b> finite <b>subgroups</b> <b>of</b> U(3) from a special type <b>of</b> finite <b>subgroups</b> <b>of</b> U(3).

Many turbellarians clone themselves by transverse or longitudinal division, and others, especially acoels, reproduce by budding.|$|E
