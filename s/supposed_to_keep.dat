Efforts to decrease mosquito larva by decreasing the availability of open water in which they develop or by adding substances to decrease their development is effective in some locations.

5|$|In 1328, Andronikos III finally overthrew his {{grandfather}} and {{established himself as}} sole emperor. Syrgiannes was freed, {{and was able to}} restore himself to Andronikos's favour, to the extent that in late 1329 he was entrusted with the important governorship of Thessalonica, the Empire's second-largest city, and of western Macedonia and Albania. There, he was again suspected of plotting against Kantakouzenos, this time with the emperor's mother, Empress Maria. She lived in Thessalonica, and was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> an eye on Syrgiannes; instead, she became so infatuated with him that she had him adopted. Following the death of the Empress in late 1333, the plot was uncovered and Syrgiannes was arrested and brought to Constantinople to face charges of treason. Syrgiannes, however, managed to escape and flee to the court of the Serbian ruler Stefan Dušan.|$|E

In Alberta, half a continent away from America's east coast and from the San Francisco Bay, cheap gas awaited. All they needed were pipelines. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, governments generally supported throwing open to all contenders the race to build pipelines.

25|$|In 268, at {{some time}} before or soon after the battle of Naissus, the {{authority}} of Gallienus was challenged by Aureolus, commander of the cavalry stationed in Mediolanum (Milan), who was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> an eye on Postumus. Instead, he acted as deputy to Postumus until the very last days of his revolt, when {{he seems to have}} claimed the throne for himself. The decisive battle took place at what is now Pontirolo Nuovo near Milan; Aureolus was clearly defeated and driven back to Milan. Gallienus laid siege to the city but was murdered during the siege. There are differing accounts of the murder, but the sources agree that most of Gallienus' officials wanted him dead. According to the Historia Augusta, an unreliable source compiled long after the events it describes, a conspiracy was led by the commander of the guard Aurelius Heraclianus and Lucius Aurelius Marcianus. Marcianus's role in the conspiracy is not confirmed by any other ancient source.|$|E
25|$|Steele, with 8,000 men, first marched {{southwest}} from Little Rock to Arkadelphia, Arkansas. Steele {{planned to}} meet a federal column of 4,000 men from Fort Smith, led by Brigadier-General John Thayer, at Arkadelphia. A Federal cavalry force of about 2,000 men from Pine Bluff, Arkansas was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> watch on the Confederate garrison at Camden, divert attention from Steele’s movement and eventually to join up with Steele. Even though Steele was three weeks behind schedule, he did not find Thayer at Arkadelphia when his forces arrived there on March 29, 1864. Steele’s men had marched {{for the last three}} days in the rain on already reduced rations. The people of the poor country along the route of the march were destitute and there was little food or forage to be had. After waiting until April 1, 1864, with his supplies being further depleted and no word from Thayer, Steele moved southwest toward Washington, Arkansas, the temporary capital of Confederate Arkansas. He eventually united with Thayer near Elkins' Ferry on the Little Missouri River on April 9, 1864. Thayer brought few supplies, however, and the combined force then became short of supplies.|$|E

Neither of these two chief-justices, I say, was ever consulted, nor one opinion taken; but they were both employed in the correspondence and private execution of this abominable project, when the prisoner himself had not either leisure or perhaps courage to give his public order in it till things got to greater ripeness.|$|R

This is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments, which were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans' evil habits. Through the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma {{can be turned into}} malleable propaganda.|$|E

2500|$|Chemarea survived until November 1, 1919—when its lampoon of Romanian King Ferdinand I {{prompted}} {{the intervention of}} military censors.

These publications were attempts to revive and radicalize the socialist literary press, that had virtually succumbed in Romania after the demise of Faclas first edition.

Only a handful of artists of various genres had recorded albums that focused on social commentary, including Curtis Mayfield. Despite some politically conscious material recorded by The Temptations in the late 1960s, Motown artists were often told to not delve into political and social commentary, fearing alienation from pop audiences.

50|$|The Presidential {{system had}} started to develop since Jacques Delors and has since been cemented. However, {{externally}} he is still dependent on support from the Council and Parliament.

The membership is now so large the President is increasingly unable to garner the support of all the states, even though the job is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> everyone happy.

2500|$|Other than recent drinking, {{the most}} common source of mouth alcohol is from belching or burping. This causes the liquids and/or gases from the stomach—including any alcohol—to rise up into the soft tissue of the {{esophagus}} and oral cavity, where it will stay until it has dissipated. The American Medical Association concludes in its Manual for Chemical Tests for Intoxication (1959): [...] "True reactions with alcohol in expired breath from sources other than the alveolar air (eructation, regurgitation, vomiting) will, of course, vitiate the breath alcohol results." [...] For this reason, police officers are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a DUI suspect under observation for at least 15 minutes prior to administering a breath test. Instruments such as the Intoxilyzer 5000 also feature a [...] "slope" [...] parameter. This parameter detects any decrease in alcohol concentration of 0.006g per 210L of breath in 0.6second, a condition indicative of residual mouth alcohol, and will result in an [...] "invalid sample" [...] warning to the operator, notifying the operator {{of the presence of}} the residual mouth alcohol.

2500|$|The 9F {{also proved}} its worth as a {{passenger}} locomotive, adept at fast running despite its small driving wheels, {{and for a}} time was a frequent sight on the Somerset and Dorset Railway, where its power and high proportion of adhesive weight were well suited to coping with the 1 in 50 ruling gradient on the Bath extension. On one occasion, a 9F was set to haul an express passenger train, in place of the normal LNER [...] "Pacific", from Grantham to King's Cross. An enthusiast aboard the train timed the run and noted that twice the speed exceeded 90mph. The driver was afterwards told that he was only <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> time, [...] "not break the bloody sound barrier!" [...] He replied that the engine had no speedometer, and that it ran so smoothly at high speeds that he just let it run as fast as felt safe.
