40|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} {{the use of}} the term ‘subluxation’ within the chiropractic profession. This paper suggests that doctors of chiropractic should develop an evidence base that focuses on the clinical entities that are treated in clinical practice. Such effort might include documenting common locally symptomatic <b>subluxations</b> in each joint region and <b>subluxations</b> that cause more distant neurophysiological effects.

25|$|Bennett {{fracture}} is {{a fracture}} {{of the base}} of the first metacarpal bone which extends into the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint. This intra-articular fracture is {{the most common type of}} fracture of the thumb, and is nearly always accompanied by some degree of <b>subluxation</b> or frank dislocation of the carpometacarpal joint.|$|E
25|$|Directional Non-Force Technique – {{utilizes}} {{a diagnostic}} system for <b>subluxation</b> analysis consisting of gentle challenging and a unique leg check allowing {{the body to}} indicate the directions of misalignment of structures that are producing nerve interference. A gentle but directionally specific thumb impulse provides a long lasting correction to bony and soft tissue structures.|$|E
25|$|In {{the most}} minor cases of Bennett fracture, {{there may be}} only small {{avulsion}} fractures, relatively little joint instability, and minimal <b>subluxation</b> of the CMC joint (less than 1mm). In such cases, closed reduction followed by immobilization in a thumb spica cast and serial radiography may be all that is required for effective treatment.|$|E
50|$|Koren {{believes}} chiropractic {{is about}} more than treating back pain. He believes the chiropractic method of adjusting <b>subluxations</b> may have positive results that range from asthma to premenstrual syndrome according to his pamphlets.|$|R
50|$|However, injury {{can occur}} through axial force {{applied to the}} second {{metacarpal}} base. Thus <b>subluxations,</b> such as ones caused by delivering blow are not uncommon. Direct trauma to the bone can also cause fracture.|$|R
2500|$|Before {{his sudden}} and {{controversial}} death in 1913, D.D. Palmer often voiced concern for B.J. Palmer's management of chiropractic. He challenged B.J.'s methods and philosophy and {{made every effort}} to regain control of chiropractic. He repudiated his earlier theory that vertebral <b>subluxations</b> caused pinched nerves in the intervertebral spaces in favor of <b>subluxations</b> causing altered nerve vibration, either too tense or too slack, affecting the tone(health) of the end organ and noted, [...] "A subluxated vertebra [...] [...] [...] is the cause of 95 percent of all diseases[...] [...] [...] The other five percent is caused by displaced joints other than those of the vertebral column." ...|$|R
25|$|Holism {{assumes that}} health is {{affected}} by everything in an individual's environment; some sources also include a spiritual or existential dimension. In contrast, reductionism in chiropractic reduces causes and cures of health problems to a single factor, vertebral <b>subluxation.</b> Homeostasis emphasizes the body's inherent self-healing abilities. Chiropractic's early notion of innate intelligence {{can be thought of}} as a metaphor for homeostasis.|$|E
25|$|X-rays of {{the hands}} and feet are {{generally}} performed when many joints affected. In RA, {{there may be no}} changes {{in the early stages of}} the disease or the x-ray may show osteopenia near the joint, soft tissue swelling, and a smaller than normal joint space. As the disease advances, there may be bony erosions and <b>subluxation.</b> Other medical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound are also used in RA.|$|E
25|$|Similar causes as extra-articular {{snapping}} hip syndrome but often with an underlying mechanical {{problem in the}} lower extremity. The pain associated with internal variety {{tends to be more}} intense and therefore more debilitating than the external variety. Intra-articular {{snapping hip}} syndrome is often indicative of injury such as a torn acetabular labrum, recurrent hip <b>subluxation,</b> ligamentum teres tears, loose bodies, articular cartilage damage, or synovial chondromatosis (cartilage formations in the synovial membrane of the joint).|$|E

50|$|Hypermobility {{has been}} {{associated}} with chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. Hypermobility causes physical trauma (in the form of joint dislocations, joint <b>subluxations,</b> joint instability, sprains, etc.).

25|$|One such {{previously}} suspected complication was coxa magna, {{which is}} an overgrowth of the femoral head and broadening of the femoral neck, accompanied by changes in the acetabulum, which may lead to <b>subluxation</b> of the femur. There was also some controversy about whether continuous high intra-articular pressure in transient synovitis could cause avascular necrosis of the femoral head (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease), but further studies did not confirm any link between the two conditions.|$|E
25|$|Orthospinology Procedure – is {{a method}} of {{analyzing}} and correcting the chiropractic upper cervical <b>subluxation</b> complex based on vertebral alignment measurements on neck x-rays taken from three different directions. The adjustment can be delivered by hand, hand-held or table mounted instruments along a pre-calculated vector using approximately 1 to 7 pounds of force. The patient is in a side-lying posture with a solid mastoid support. The procedure {{is based on the}} work of the late John F. Grostic, D.C.|$|E
25|$|Neurological: Peripheral {{neuropathy}} and {{mononeuritis multiplex}} may occur. The most common problem is {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} caused by compression of the median nerve by swelling around the wrist. Rheumatoid disease of the spine can lead to myelopathy. Atlanto-axial <b>subluxation</b> can occur, owing to erosion of the odontoid process and/or transverse ligaments in the cervical spine's connection to the skull. Such an erosion (>3mm) can give rise to vertebrae slipping over one another and compressing the spinal cord. Clumsiness is initially experienced, but without due care, this can progress to quadriplegia or even death.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this case study is to discuss a case study {{involving}} a pediatric female presenting to a chiropractic office with asthma, vertebral <b>subluxations,</b> and scoliosis.

50|$|This {{is quite}} a common {{condition}} {{and one of the}} most common traumatic dental disorders. However, the exact prevalence is difficult to be assessed because dental <b>subluxations</b> are often asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic, and even overlooked by caregivers when treating more serious dental traumas in adjacent teeth.|$|R
50|$|The {{instability}} of joints, leading to (<b>sub)luxations</b> and joint pain, often require surgical intervention {{in patients with}} Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Instability of almost all joints can happen but appear most often in the lower and upper extremities, with the wrist, fingers, shoulder, knee, hip, and ankle being most common.|$|R
25|$|Dogs might exhibit {{signs of}} {{stiffness}} or soreness after rising from rest, reluctance to exercise, bunny-hopping or other abnormal gait (legs move more together when running rather than swinging alternately), lameness, pain, reluctance {{to stand on}} rear legs, jump up, or climb stairs, <b>subluxation</b> or dislocation of the hip joint, or wasting away of the muscle mass in the hip area. Radiographs (X-rays) often confirm the presence of hip dysplasia, but radiographic features may not be present until two years of age in some dogs. Moreover, many affected dogs do not show clinical signs, but some dogs manifest the problem before seven months of age, while others do not show it until well into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|The {{shoulder}} joint {{is the most}} frequently dislocated major joint of the body. In a typical case of a dislocated shoulder, a strong force that pulls the shoulder outward (abduction) or extreme rotation of the joint pops the ball of the humerus out of the shoulder socket. Dislocation commonly occurs {{when there is a}} backward pull on the arm that either catches the muscles unprepared to resist or overwhelms the muscles. When a shoulder dislocates frequently, the condition is referred to as shoulder instability. A partial dislocation where the upper arm bone is partially in and partially out of the socket is called a <b>subluxation.</b> In the medical community, dislocation is commonly referred to as luxation.|$|E
25|$|Since D.D. Palmer's first {{claim of}} {{restoring}} hearing to Harvey Lillard, {{there has been}} controversy about whether a link actually could exist between the spinal adjustment and return of hearing. Critics asserted that a spinal adjustment cannot affect certain areas– like the brain– because the spinal nerves do not extend into the encephalon. Years later, V. Strang, D.C. illustrated several neurological explanations including the recognition that sympathetic nerves arising in the lateral horns of the upper thoracic levels of the spine form the upper cervical ganglion with postganglionic fibers ascending to supply, among other things, blood vessels of the brain, but still with no connection to hearing. Others, though, talked about vertebral <b>subluxation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Spinal {{manipulation}} {{does not}} appear to be helpful. Although claims have been made for chiropractic care, under the theory that treating <b>subluxations</b> in the spine may decrease symptoms, a 2006 systematic review found that overall no evidence suggests that spinal manipulation is effective for treatment of primary and secondary dysmenorrhea.|$|R
30|$|The knee score, {{function}} score, and radiographic evaluation {{were significantly}} not different {{between the two}} groups at final follow-up. No revisions, <b>subluxations,</b> dislocations, or infections were seen. Also, no radiographic evidence of component loosening, osteolysis, or malalignment was observed in any knee. The results for both groups show good patient satisfaction.|$|R
50|$|Achard {{syndrome}} is a syndrome consisting of arachnodactyly, receding lower jaw, and joint laxity {{limited to the}} hands and feet. Hypermobility and <b>subluxations</b> of the joints, increased lateral excursion of the patellas and other findings reflect the increased ligament laxity. It is not clear {{if it is a}} distinct entity.|$|R
25|$|Vertebral <b>subluxation,</b> a core {{concept of}} {{traditional}} chiropractic, remains unsubstantiated and largely untested, and {{a debate about}} whether {{to keep it in}} the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing for decades. In general, critics of traditional subluxation-based chiropractic (including chiropractors) are skeptical of its clinical value, dogmatic beliefs and metaphysical approach. While straight chiropractic still retains the traditional vitalistic construct espoused by the founders, evidence-based chiropractic suggests that a mechanistic view will allow chiropractic care to become integrated into the wider health care community. This is still a continuing source of debate within the chiropractic profession as well, with some schools of chiropractic still teaching the traditional/straight subluxation-based chiropractic, while others have moved towards an evidence-based chiropractic that rejects metaphysical foundings and limits itself to primarily neuromusculoskeletal conditions.|$|E
25|$|Against Philadelphia, Ryan Callahan {{scored a}} goal to earn his 200th career point, but {{suffered}} a left shoulder <b>subluxation</b> during a third period fight with Maxime Talbot, an injury that was expected to make him miss up to 14 days. The Flyers only goal came on the power play shortly after Callahan left, raising concerns about how his absence would affect the Ranger's penalty killing and defensive forward play. The Rangers ended the month with a 0–3 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on January 31, the team's first shutout loss in 31 regular season games. New York failed to score on four power plays without Callahan and surrendered seven penalties, including their fourth penalty for too many men on the ice in seven games, {{the most of any}} team in the league.|$|E
25|$|After {{averaging}} 9.5 {{points per}} game over the first 12 games of the season, Gordon was ruled out indefinitely with a left shoulder injury on November 24, 2014. An MRI revealed Gordon suffered a torn labrum {{as a result of}} the left shoulder <b>subluxation</b> injury that he occurred against the Utah Jazz on November 22. He subsequently missed 21 games with the injury before returning to the court on January 5, 2015 against the Washington Wizards. In just under 33 minutes of action, he recorded 6 points, 4 rebounds and 5 assists in the 85-92 loss. Two days later, he hit three three-pointers against the Charlotte Hornets, going on to make at least one three-pointer in 36 consecutive games, a streak that finally came to an end on March 25 when he went 0-for-3 from beyond the arc against the Houston Rockets.|$|E
