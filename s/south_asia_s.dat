40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War freed India-U. S. {{relations}} {{from the}} constraints of global bipolarity, but interactions continued for a decade {{to be affected by}} the burden of history, most notably the longstanding India-Pakistan rivalry and nuclear weapons proliferation in the region. Recent years, however, have witnessed a sea change in bilateral relations, with more positive interactions becoming the norm. India's swift offer of full support for U. S. -led counterterrorism operations after September 2001 was widely viewed as reflective of such change.

40|$|Following the {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11 th, 2001, the US government has become increasingly concerned with madrassas, Islamic schools of religious education in Central and <b>South</b> <b>Asia.</b> U. <b>S.</b> Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell denounced these religious seminaries as radical institutions which produce Islamic jihadists capable of threatening U. S. national security and interests. This thesis examines the history and current evidence available on madrassas. Specifically, it analyzes their historical evolution and reaction to domestic, regional and international developments. It finds that there is little evidence to connect madrassas to transnational terrorism, and that they are not a direct threat to the United States. However, Pakistani madrassas do have ties to domestic and regional violence, particularly Sunni-Shia sectarian violence in Pakistan and the Pakistani-Indian conflict in Kashmir, making them a regional security concern. This thesis argues that the best path for combating religious militancy in madrassas is by helping to create better alternatives to madrassa education, including state run and private schools, and not by targeting madrassas directly...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRising {{propensity}} of precipitation extremes and concomitant decline of summer-monsoon rains are amongst the most distinctive hydroclimatic signals {{that have emerged}} over <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> since 1950 <b>s.</b> A {{clear understanding of the}} underlying causes driving these monsoon hydroclimatic signals has remained elusive. Using a state-of-the-art global climate model with high-resolution zooming over <b>South</b> <b>Asia,</b> we demonstrate that a juxtaposition of regional land-use changes, anthropogenic-aerosol forcing and the rapid warming signal of the equatorial Indian Ocean is crucial to produce the observed monsoon weakening in recent decades. Our findings also show that this monsoonal weakening significantly enhances occurrence of localized intense precipitation events, as compared to the global-warming response. A 21 st century climate projection using the same high-resolution model indicates persistent decrease of monsoonal rains and prolongation of soil drying. Critical value-additions from this study include (1) realistic simulation of the mean and long-term historical trends in the Indian monsoon rainfall (2) robust attributions of changes in moderate and heavy precipitation events over Central India (3) a 21 st century projection of drying trend of the South Asian monsoon. The present findings have profound bearing on the regional water-security, which is already under severe hydrological-stress...|$|R
40|$|Tospoviruses are {{emerging}} as a major constraint {{to the production of}} a broad range of economically important crops in <b>South</b> and Southeast <b>Asia</b> (<b>S</b> & SEA). Available data suggest that the majority of these viruses belong to serogroup IV (Watermelon silver mottle virus serogroup). Many of these viruses show geographical structuring in that they are restricted to the Asian continent. In recent years, tospovirus species like Capsicum chlorosis virus and Iris yellow spot virus, present in other continents, {{have been reported in the}} S & SEA region. Among different species of thrips (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) that have been confirmed as vectors of one or more tospoviruses worldwide, only a few have been authenticated to be present in the S & SEA region. The current knowledge on the distribution of thrips vectors and tospoviruses in the region will be reviewed and the research needs for a better understanding of the growing impact of tospoviruses and thrips vectors will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the clonal relationships of ciprofloxacin-resistant Shigella dysenteriae type 1 strains isolated from <b>south</b> <b>Asia,</b> and <b>S.</b> dysenteriae 1 strains associated with epidemics in 1978, 1984 and 1994. Methods: The antimicrobial susceptibilities were examined by NCCLS methods. Molecular epidemio-logical characterization was performed by plasmid profiling, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and mutation analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of gyrA by sequencing. Results: Plasmid patterns of the current ciprofloxacin-resistant strains from India, Nepal and Bangladesh were very similar to those of the 1978, 1984 and 1994 epidemic isolates of S. dysenteriae 1, except for the presence of a new plasmid of 2. 6 MDa, which was found in one recent ciprofloxacin-resistant strain isolated in Bangladesh. PFGE analysis showed that the ciprofloxacin-resistant strains isolated in Bangladesh, India and Nepal belonged to a PFGE type (type A), which was possibly related to that of the 1984 and 1994 clone of S. dysenteriae 1, but different from 1978 epidemic strains. The current ciprofloxacin-resistant strains belong to five subtypes (A 3 –A 7), all of which were found in India, but in Bangladesh and Nepal, only A 3 existed. Mutation analysis of the QRDR of gyrA revealed that amino acid substitutions at positions 83 and 87 of ciprofloxacin-resistant strains isolated i...|$|R

40|$|<b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> has {{attracted}} global attention {{because it has}} experienced rapid GDP growth {{over the last two}} decades. What is not so well known is that <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> is the least integrated region in the world. <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> has opened its door {{to the rest of the}} world but it remains closed to its neighbors. Poor market integration, weak connectivity, and a history of friction and conflict have resulted in two <b>South</b> <b>Asias.</b> The first <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> is dynamic, growing rapidly, highly urbanized, and is benefiting from global integration. The second <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> is rural, land locked, full of poverty, and lagging. The divergence between the two <b>South</b> <b>Asias</b> is on the rise. Policy makers in <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> have realized that countries and regions can not grow in isolation. The unique geography of South Asia— distance and density—has the potential to raise growth through increased flow of labor, capital, ideas, technology, goods and services within the region and with the rest of the world. Most lagging regions, in terms of both per capita income and poverty incidence, in <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> are either land-locked or located in the border areas. Regional cooperation and market integration will unlock the development of these lagging regions in <b>South</b> <b>Asia.</b> This paper—a product of the <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> Regional Programs Unit, <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> Region—is part of a larger effort in the Region to promote dialogue and debate on the importance of regional cooperation for growth and poverty reduction i...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{sharing a}} common culture and heritage, <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> {{is one of}} the least {{integrated}} regions of the world. There are numerous persistent problems creating continuous hurdles for regional integration in <b>South</b> <b>Asia.</b> In this paper an effort is made to present the case for the regional integration of <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> from the perspective of functional theory. Interestingly, some countries in <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> are energy deficit and some have vast unexplored potential to meet these shortfalls. The pertinent issue is how to link demand and supply of energy in <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> so that it subsequently becomes a functional area for cooperation. This paper considers prevalent models of cooperation in energy security of other regions and argues how it can be relevant to the context of <b>South</b> <b>Asia.</b> The role of various actors essential for promoting cooperation in energy security in <b>South</b> <b>Asia</b> is discussed in this paper. Also, in order to substantiate the application of functional theory, the example of the European Union's policy is briefly outlined...|$|R
