25|$|Carcetti {{watches a}} news {{report about the}} exhumed bodies and {{discusses}} the political implications with his staff. Norman Wilson remarks that the bodies are attributable to the Royce administration and Michael Steintorf, the new chief of staff, states that the <b>silver</b> <b>lining</b> {{of the story is}} that it draws attention away from the massive school deficit. Steintorf counsels that they should use this as cover to avoid dealing with the deficit as it would hamstring Carcetti's plans to run for governor and that Carcetti will have the funds to address the city's education problems when he becomes governor. Wilson is disappointed to see that Carcetti is willing to trade fulfilling his responsibilities as mayor with increasing his chances of becoming governor.|$|E
500|$|Janet Maslin, {{writing in}} The New York Times, thought Johnny Depp [...] "proved" [...] {{himself as an}} {{established}} [...] "certified great actor". [...] "Depp captures all the can-do optimism that kept Ed Wood going, thanks to an extremely funny ability {{to look at the}} <b>silver</b> <b>lining</b> of any cloud." [...] Todd McCarthy from Variety called Ed Wood [...] "a fanciful, sweet-tempered biopic about the man often described as the worst film director of all time. Always engaging to watch and often dazzling in its imagination and technique, picture is also a bit distended, and lacking in weight at its center. The result is beguiling rather than thrilling." ...|$|E
500|$|Keith Stuart, from The Guardian, {{pointed out}} the {{contrast}} between Square Enix's policy and that of companies like Valve, which officially adopted the Half-Life fan mods Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat, and Vivendi Universal Games, which granted a licence to the King's Quest fan game The <b>Silver</b> <b>Lining.</b> He noted that since Crimson Echoes was a ROM hack, {{it was in a}} [...] "trickier area of copy protection law" [...] than those other projects, but felt that its release would have had next to no commercial impact since the game was to be distributed as an IPS patch rather than a ROM image. Finally, he noted that an official port of the fangame to the Nintendo DS or WiiWare would have had more [...] "marketing benefits" [...] for Square Enix.|$|E
50|$|On December 13, 2009, the Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line,</b> Metro's second Metro Transitway (bus rapid transit) line, began service {{between the}} Harbor Gateway Transit Center, Downtown Los Angeles and El Monte Station.

500|$|In July 1790 the Russian Baltic Fleet was {{defeated}} by the Swedish at the Battle of Svensksund. Despite the damage, the <b>silver</b> <b>lining</b> for the Russians was that the Swedes now felt able to negotiate on an even footing and a peace was soon signed, based on the status quo ante bellum, thus ending the threat of invasion. The peace also freed up military resources for {{the war against the}} Turks. Potemkin had moved his evermore lavish court to Bender and there were soon more successes against Turkey, including the capture of Batal-Pasha and, on the second attempt, of Kilia on the Danube. By the end of November, only one major target remained: the Turkish fortress of Izmail. At Potemkin's request, General Suvorov commanded the assault, which proved to be costly but effective. The victory was commemorated by Russia's first, albeit unofficial, national anthem, [...] "Let the thunder of victory sound!", written by Gavrila Derzhavin and Osip Kozlovsky.|$|E
500|$|In 1982 El Salvador took a 20-man squad (two players {{short of}} the normal 22, as a {{controversial}} cost–saving measure), coached by the aforementioned Mauricio [...] "Pipo" [...] Rodríguez, to Spain. The team's experience was an unhappy one. In their first match on June 15 in Elche, they were defeated 10–1 by Hungary, a scoreline that stands as a World Cup record to this day. A <b>silver</b> <b>lining</b> was that Luis Baltazar Ramírez Zapata scored the country's first World Cup goal during the game, albeit at a point when the Salvadorans were already down 5–0. It was cold comfort however. When Zapata scored against Hungary, some Salvadorans cried out to Zapata not to celebrate the goal effusively because it might make the Hungarians angry {{and encourage them to}} score more. El Salvador managed to regain some pride in their subsequent games. Displaying much-improved levels of organisation and commitment, they lost 1–0 to Belgium on June 19 in Elche and 2–0 to the then-reigning world champions, Argentina, in Alicante on June 23.|$|E
500|$|At the 1999 Tournament of the Americas, Nash led Canada to {{the silver}} medal, {{qualifying}} {{the team for}} the Olympics {{for the first time}} in 12 years; he was named tournament MVP. Nash captained Canada at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. He led Canada to win their round robin group with a victory over Spain and a stunning 83–75 win over favoured Yugoslavia when he scored 26 points with eight rebounds and eight assists. Canada was eliminated in the quarterfinals with a five-point loss to France and Nash left the court in tears. Nash expressed disappointment with the result, saying [...] "It hurts a lot. I feel like I let everybody down. We could have been in the championship game. We were good enough." [...] Nevertheless, he did see a possible <b>silver</b> <b>lining,</b> saying [...] "Hopefully kids [...] will be inspired to play—that's what I really hope." [...] A victory in its final game of the tournament, a placement game against Russia, enabled Canada to salvage seventh place. Nash's Olympic performance propelled him to stardom in Canada and he finished fifth in voting for the 2000 Lionel Conacher Award, which is handed out to the Canadian male athlete of the year.|$|E

It was introduced by Osbert Lancaster in 1939 at the Daily Express. A 2005 obituary by The Guardian of its pocket cartoonist David Austin said [...] "Newspaper readers instinctively look to the pocket cartoon to reassure them that the disasters and afflictions besetting them each morning are not final.

2500|$|In January 1384, the Pegu court {{chose the}} rebel son Nwe, {{who took the}} reign name of Razadarit. Byattaba and Laukpya did not {{acknowledge}} the new king, who at his accession had not yet turned 16. It was not just them. Even rulers of the northern Martaban province who were loyal to the late king refused to acknowledge the new boy king. Razadarit for his part considered the entire [...] "32 districts" [...] of the Martaban province in revolt. One <b>silver</b> <b>lining</b> was that not all the rebels were united. For example, Gov. Smim Than-Hlyit of Donwun, who fought against Byattaba in the 1360s, declared {{that he was not}} allied anyone.|$|E
2500|$|The {{devastation of}} the war did bring a <b>silver</b> <b>lining.</b> In 1919, the French {{government}} passed a series of laws that would {{lay the groundwork for}} the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) system that would strictly define winemaking laws and regional boundaries. Measures were taken to eliminate fraud and illegal additives such as rhubarb and apple juice. Only grapes grown from the delineated Champagne region, which would eventually include the Aube, could be legally called [...] "Champagne". The decimation of the region's vineyards provided the opportunity for vine growers to replant with phylloxera resistant rootstock and in more ideal locations for quality grape production. But amidst this <b>silver</b> <b>lining,</b> more dark clouds would emerge as the full effects of the Russian Revolution hit home and the lucrative Russian market was closed to Champagne imports. The 1920 declaration of prohibition in the United States closed off yet another market and the global economic downturn of the Great Depression lead to a further decrease in sales. World War II would bring more troops marching through the vineyards of Champagne. While the devastation brought to the region was not as severe as the previous war, World War II was still a troubling time for the region. It was in Reims, on May 7, 1945 that the German military commander Alfred Jodl offered an unconditional surrender to the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower. The following morning, the signing was celebrated with 6 cases of the 1934 vintage of Pommery. Wine historians Don and Petie Kladstrup noted that a World War II historian would later comment that [...] "the last explosions {{of the war}} were the popping of Champagne corks".|$|E
2500|$|The MBTA and MassDOT are {{building}} a new <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> route to Chelsea via East Boston, the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> Gateway [...] project.

The new <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> and commuter rail stations will be fully handicapped accessible. The <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> extension and new commuter rail stop will be built in two phases.

50|$|Usage of {{the lanes}} and bus {{services}} has been low, but the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> has helped raise ridership on the Harbor Transitway. The Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> began service on December 13, 2009. Ridership {{is lower than}} the El Monte Busway, which is also served by the Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line.</b> A number of reasons have been identified: The main causes for the low ridership are the premium express fare charged to passengers compared to riders on the Blue Line and Metro Rapid (up to $1 more each way than a trip made on the Rapid or Blue Line), the isolated and noisy freeway environment of the stations, and the inconvenience of accessing the stations (and lack of surrounding buses) around the stations compared to surface level light rail or Rapid service. Ridership began increasing {{with the advent of the}} Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line.</b> In late June 2011, Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> service frequency increased from 30 mins to 15 mins on Weekdays and on Saturdays, service increased from 60 mins to 40 mins. In the February 2012 Metro Express Lanes Program report, ridership on the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> alone on the Harbor Transitway was 3,969. The report revealed that ridership on the Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> alone increased 43% from the June 2011 improved frequency of the Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line.</b> On June 17, 2012 Metro added the second phase of adding more service to the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line.</b> Weekday peak hour service was added for the Metro <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> (an improvement from 10 mins to 4-8 mins). Saturday, Sunday/Holiday service was added for the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> (an improvement from 40 mins to 20 mins on Saturdays and from 60 mins to 30 mins on Sundays/Holidays).|$|R
50|$|In December 2015, Metro {{restructured}} the <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> and Metro Express 450X. Now during {{off-peak hours}} and weekends some <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> trips travel to San Pedro and during weekday peak periods a <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> Express route operates between San Pedro and El Monte, skipping {{most of the}} stations along the Harbor Transitway. The change gave passengers a one-seat ride to San Pedro during the off-peak periods and created more <b>Silver</b> <b>Line</b> service on the El Monte Busway.|$|R
2500|$|... 1983–84 was a trying {{season in}} the league, with Everton being in {{the bottom half of}} the First Division for much of the season and fans making {{continued}} calls for Howard Kendall to be sacked, but a good run of form in the final weeks of the season saw Everton achieve a seventh-place finish once again. Everton, however, were progressing on two cup fronts. Reaching their second League Cup final, now known as the Milk Cup, the Blues drew 0–0 with Liverpool at Wembley, but eventually lost the replay. The FA Cup though was the <b>silver</b> <b>lining,</b> with Everton winning the final 2–0 against Watford to end a 14-year trophy drought. This was the fourth time Everton had won the Cup.|$|E
2500|$|The New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Land Company, a {{means of}} {{transferring}} land held by the Crown to individual owners, was chartered in New Brunswick in 1831. Financed by shares sold in England, this company purchased large areas of Canadian land at low prices, promising to develop roads, mills and towns. [...] Although the province was largely rural, the colony, prior {{to the middle of}} the century, was not self-sufficient in wheat or flour and imports were thus necessary. In fact, Governor Douglas saw a <b>silver</b> <b>lining</b> in the great 1825 Miramichi Fire; he is recorded to have declared that the fire had positive aspects, in that it cleared the forest so that residents might dedicate themselves to farming, instead of relying on the sale of timber in order to purchase imported foodstuffs.|$|E

Only two NL teams have a worse Home record: the Atlanta Braves (19-44) with a 48-83 record, and the Arizona Diamondbacks (25-43) with a 55-76 record. The San Diego Padres are 30-34 with a 55-75 record, and the Philadelphia Phillies are 30-33 with a 60-70 record, for two bad teams that are better at Home. Their arch-rivals in the Central Division, the Chicago Cubs are a {{blistering}} 45-19 (.703) at Home, and an excellent 37-28 ( [...] ,569) on the Road, for an overall MLB best 82-47 (.636), leading the Cardinals by 14 games, with only 33 games remaining.|$|E

2500|$|In 1994, Depp {{reunited with}} {{director}} Tim Burton, playing {{the title role}} in Ed Wood, a biographical film about one of history's most inept film directors.

[...] He found that the role gave him a [...] "chance to stretch out and have some fun" [...] and that working with Martin Landau, who played Bela Lugosi, [...] "rejuvenated my love for acting". Ed Wood received critical acclaim, with Janet Maslin of The New York Times writing that Depp had [...] "proved himself as an established, certified great actor" [...] and [...] "captured all the can-do optimism that kept Ed Wood going, thanks to an extremely funny ability to look at the <b>silver</b> <b>lining</b> of any cloud."

2500|$|That {{company of}} Hunsdon's, known to posterity as The Lord Chamberlain's Men, was {{organized}} somewhat like a modern joint-stock commercial company (the concept {{of which was}} just beginning to evolve in this era) at its re-formation in 1594, after the long plague closure. The company had a small number of partners or shareholders, who pooled their funds to pay expenses and in turn shared the profits, in what was largely a de facto democratic way (at least for the sharers, if not for the hired men and apprentices they employed). Their main rivals, the Admiral's Men, suffered in contrast under a less ideal version of capitalist organization: Philip Henslowe functioned more like a blend of big-business autocrat, landlord, and loan shark. He managed multiple companies of actors and built and owned several theatres, and controlled players (sharers included) and playwrights by doling out payments and loans. (The <b>silver</b> <b>lining</b> in this cloud is that Henslowe's surviving financial records provide a wealth of detailed knowledge about the theatre conditions in his era that is unparalleled by any other source.) Other companies varied between these extremes of organization. (Francis Langley, builder of the Swan Theatre, operated much as Henslowe did, though less successfully, and for a shorter time.) ...|$|E
