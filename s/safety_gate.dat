2500|$|On 8 October 2006, a {{woman in}} her thirties was seriously injured on the log boat ride [...] "Flumeride". At the second and final drop, a [...] slope, the woman {{apparently}} panicked, and tried to keep the log boat from travelling down the slope by holding onto the railings. She was ejected from the boat into the water and slid down the slope, where she was hit in the head by {{at least one of the}} two following log boats. Since she had managed to temporarily keep the log boat from dropping down the slope, the following two log boats passed the last <b>safety</b> <b>gate,</b> and couldn't be stopped from falling down the last slope where the woman was located. The event was witnessed by the staff who stopped the ride, but were unable to prevent two of the log boats from continuing. The woman, who was travelling together with her 11-year-old daughter and another woman, was taken to Sahlgrenska University Hospital, where she was reported to be in critical but stable condition. An investigation has been initiated by the authorities, and Liseberg has also initiated an internal inquiry. She eventually recovered fully.|$|E

50|$|The current railway {{crossing}} at Gilchrest Road West is now protected with crossbucks, flashing lights, a warning bell and <b>safety</b> <b>gates.</b> Frequent freight trains are operated there by CSX Transportation. This accident helped {{change the law}} requiring school buses to stop, open their bus door and listen for a specific amount of time before crossing any railroad track.|$|R
50|$|A baby gate {{or child}} <b>safety</b> <b>gate</b> is a {{protective}} barrier {{designed to prevent}} babies and toddlers from accessing areas of a home where they might be unsafe, such as stairways and kitchens. Baby gates are typically constructed of metal, plastic and/or wood, and can be expanded to fit {{in a range of}} doorway widths. They may be designed for use indoors or out, and may be either hardware or pressure-mounted.|$|E
50|$|A web {{application}} firewall (or WAF) filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic {{to and from}} a {{web application}}. A WAF is differentiated from a regular firewall in that a WAF is able to filter the content of specific web applications while regular firewalls serve as a <b>safety</b> <b>gate</b> between servers. By inspecting HTTP traffic, it can prevent attacks stemming from web application security flaws, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and security misconfigurations.|$|E
50|$|If a {{passenger}} fails to unload, their legs will contact a lightweight bar, line, or {{pass through a}} light beam which stops the lift. The lift operator will then help them disembark, reset the <b>safety</b> <b>gate,</b> and initiate the lift restart procedure. While possibly annoying to other passengers on the chairlift, it is preferable to strike the safety gate—that is, {{it should not be}} avoided—and stop the lift than be an unexpected downhill passenger. Many lifts are limited in their download capacity; others can transport passengers at 100 percent capacity in either direction.|$|E
50|$|In 1938 stop planks and <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> were {{installed}} in the Regent's Canal and in the Grand Union Canal in Greater London area and its Slough branch. Stop plank grooves were cut {{at each end of}} the aqueducts and at all weir sluices, whilst the stop gates were built in such a way that they did not unduly obstruct canal traffic.|$|R

50|$|The Roundabout island at Old Turn Junction was {{installed}} during WWII, {{to facilitate the}} insertion of <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> to protect the railway tunnel of the Stour Valley railway line that runs beneath it, {{in the event of}} a breach through bombing. The canal at this point was too wide and the island was required to narrow the canal enough for gates to be installed when required.|$|R
50|$|Malfunctioning {{of control}} systems {{can lead to}} {{unacceptable}} risk, jeopardizing both capital investments and people. To eliminate such risks as far as possible, the relevant control systems must meet exacting requirements in terms of functional safety. These requirements can {{include the use of}} <b>safety</b> <b>gate</b> switches or trapped key interlock systems. The standard EN/IEC 954-1 (Safety of machinery, Safety related parts of control systems, Part 1: General principles for design) has been replaced by EN/ISO13849-1 (Safety of machinery, Safetyrelated parts of control systems, Part 1: General principles for design) and EN/IEC 62061 (Safety of machinery, Functional safety of safety related electrical, electronic and programmable electronic control systems).|$|E
50|$|The {{north and}} south portals are on almost the same level (around 250 m above sea level). The tunnels rise {{slightly}} towards their centre, which are about 16 m higher. The north portal is 253.73 m above sea level and the tunnels then initially ascend on a gradient of 0.1% for about 2,433.5 m and towards the centre, the gradient rises at 0.54% to the 3,280.8 m point. At this point, the tunnels reach their highest point of 269.43 m. To improve the ventilation, a 65 m deep ventilation shaft was built above the highest point of both bores near Gupf. They have internal diameters of six metres and their shafts end approximately three metres above ground level. They are protected with fencing and a <b>safety</b> <b>gate.</b> The tunnels then descend over a length of 4,964.8 m on a gradient of 0.35% to the south portal, which is at an elevation of 256.84 m, which is about three metres above the north portal.|$|E

5000|$|Regional-Express {{services}} on the [...] Hamburg -Rostock route stop in Schwanheide. The line is built for speeds {{of up to}} 230 km/h. Express trains pass through the station at high speeds, requiring the platforms to be secured by <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> with warning signs. The border crossing building stands empty and exposed to vandalism. The station building, which was also empty, was demolished in 2012.|$|R
50|$|Canal <b>Safety</b> <b>Gates</b> or Canal Air Raid Protection Gates are {{structures}} that were installed on canals specifically {{to reduce or}} prevent flood damage to dwellings, factories, etc. {{in the event of}} aqueducts, canal banks, etc. being breached either through natural events or by enemy action during wars, insurgency, sabotage, etc. They sometimes have a secondary function in regard of canal maintenance work. Substantial structures or simple 'Stop Gates' or 'Stop Planks' were used to prevent flooding and were usually only put in place when air raid warnings were given.|$|R
50|$|The Gloucester and Sharpness Canal is 17 {{miles long}} canal, up to 5 metres in depth {{so that in}} the event of a canal breach {{millions}} of litres of water would flood the area. A series of <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> are located along the canal and are particularly important as an unusual feature of the canal is a lack of locks, being described as a contour canal. In an emergency these gates automatically close to ensure that any risk created by a flood is controlled, protecting Gloucester and the villages along the course of the canal to Sharpness.|$|R
40|$|Foreigners {{coming to}} the {{south-western}} coast of India have produced seemingly contrasting statements in the past regarding the existence of territories there. Two examples may serve as illustrations. Ibn Battûta, who travelled throughout this coast in the 1340 s, states: There are in Malabar twelve idolatrous sultans…. Between the States of each of them, there is a wooden gate on which is engraved {{the name of the}} one whose domain starts from this point. It is called the <b>safety</b> <b>gate</b> of "N". When after some offence a Muslim or an idolatrous has fled the State of one of these princes, and has reached the <b>safety</b> <b>gate</b> of another prince, he is in security, and the one he flees cannot seize him even though he be powerful and heading numerous armies. (Ibn Battûta 1982 : III- 197 - my translation from the French version). In contrast, Van Reede, the first Dutch Governor in Cochin, writes in 1677 : The extent of each realm is expressed {{in terms of the number}} of soldiers the Chief could command- the territorial extent not being taken into consideration. Of course there are traditional boundaries for each Nad [principality] over which the individual chieftains held sway. (Van Reede, quoted by Raman Menon 1936 : 12). Thus, on the one hand sacrosanct boundaries marked by gates are mentioned, while, o...|$|E
5|$|At midday on 3 March 1945 {{teletype}} {{messages from}} Bomber Command Headquarters at RAF High Wycombe began reaching the airfields of RAF squadrons in Eastern England. On this night a planned raid with moderate numbers of bombers was planned over western Germany. A complex plan of feint attacks and diversions to deceive German air defence system were drawn up. The main force was {{split into two}} separate groups in the Münster area; No. 4 Group RAF were ordered to destroy the synthetic oil plant at Kamen and No. 5 Group RAF would attempt to eliminate the aqueduct, <b>safety</b> <b>gates,</b> and canal boats on the Dortmund–Ems Canal at Ladbergen.|$|R
50|$|Baby on the Move sells {{a variety}} of baby safety equipment, {{including}} car seats and restraints for infants. Other products include portable cots, flat folding baths, stainless steel baby bottles, buggies, bassinets, infant capsules with bases, exersaucers, toddler seats, cots, monitors, and <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> for doorways. Some of the products can be rented, while the remaining are available only for purchase. They also conduct inspections to check whether the already existing child restraints are safe or not. Baby on the Move staff and franchisees have 'safe to go' accreditation which allows them to lawfully install a child seat to comply with New Zealand law and safety guidelines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>gates</b> {{are used}} to help prevent a child from {{accessing}} an area of a house, especially the stairway, or to allow an exterior door to be open for ventilation while restricting movement of a child. Pressure gates and hardware mounted gates are available. Pressure gates can be dislodged by children {{and should not be}} used at the top of stairs. In some situations, pressure gates at the top of stairs have caused serious injury when a child has run against it or when a parent has fallen trying to step over the gate. Hardware mounted gates are the most secure option and should be installed securely into wall studs.|$|R
5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|R
50|$|Large {{volumes of}} stored water have {{considerable}} destructive potential and where {{structures such as}} canals run on embankments above low lying built up areas or where aqueducts exist, appropriate safety precautions were taken either as a war time contingency or {{at the time of}} construction. These 'Canal Safety Gates' or 'Canal Air Raid Protection Gates (ARPG)' were constructed and installed in regard to the scale of the danger posed and ranged from simple wooden planks known as 'Stop Gates' or 'Stop Planks' to more massive constructions built of concrete and steel such as the <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> built on the Forth and Clyde Canal near Stockingfield Junction and on the Glasgow Branch at Firhill Road and Craighall Road.|$|R
50|$|Another {{criticism}} is that gated communities offer {{a false sense}} of security. Some studies indicate that <b>safety</b> in <b>gated</b> communities may be more illusion than reality and that gated communities in suburban areas of the United States have no less crime than similar non-gated neighborhoods.|$|R
50|$|The {{total length}} of the dug main canals is 929 km, {{including}} new and old canals and streams which were completely or partially reconstructed and thus included in the new system. In the basic canal network there are 51 structures - 24 gates, 16 locks, five <b>safety</b> <b>gates,</b> six pumping stations, and 180 bridges. There are 14 cargo ports on the canals. On the new canals of the Danube-Tisa-Danube water system, 84 bridges were built - 62 carriageway, 19 railway and 3 pedestrian bridges. One {{of the most important}} structures within this water system is the dam on the river Tisa near Novi Bečej which regulates the water regime in the basic canal network in Banat, for irrigation of about 3,000 km².|$|R
40|$|In most {{countries}} falls {{are the most}} common medically attended childhood injury and the majority of injuries in pre-school children occur at home. Numerous systematic reviews have reviewed evidence of the effectiveness of falls prevention interventions, but this evidence has not been synthesised into an overview, making it difficult for policy makers and practitioners to easily access the evidence. To synthesise all available evidence, we conducted an overview of reviews of home safety interventions targeting childhood falls, extracted data from primary studies included in the reviews and supplemented this with a systematic review of primary studies published subsequent to the reviews. Bibliographic databases, websites, conference proceedings, journals and bibliographies of included studies were searched for systematic reviews of studies with experimental or controlled observational designs. Thirteen reviews were identified containing 24 primary studies. Searches for additional primary studies identified five further studies not included in reviews. Evidence of the effect of interventions on falls or fall injuries was sparse, with only one of three primary studies reporting this outcome finding a reduction in falls. Interventions were effective in promoting the use of <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> and furniture corner covers. There was some evidence of a reduction in baby walker use. The effect on the use of window safety devices, non-slip bath mats/decals and the reduction of tripping hazards was mixed. There was limited evidence that interventions were effective in improving lighting in corridors, altering furniture layout and restricting access to roofs. Most interventions to prevent childhood falls at home have not been evaluated in terms of their effect on reducing falls. Policy makers and practitioners should promote use of <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> and furniture covers and restriction of baby walker use. Further research evaluating the effect of interventions to reduce falls and falls-related injuries is urgently requiredPeer reviewe...|$|R

Some aircraft withdrew owing to mechanical difficulties but 91 dropped 3,721 bundles of Window over the North Sea. Five Halifaxes, three B-24 Liberators and eight B-17 Flying Fortress also assisted with jamming operations. The USAAF committed 24 B-24s to bomb Emden {{in support of}} the main force. In the final pre-amble to the main attack No. 100 Group committed 10 Halifaxes and six Mosquitos to drop target markers over Meppen to mislead German ground controllers into believing it was the target. The bombers struck Ladbergen, and the canal burst its banks, the <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> were overwhelmed and canal boats were stranded. The attack lasted just 25 minutes.|$|R
25|$|An early {{development}} of sequential control was relay logic, by which electrical relays engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt {{power to a}} device. Relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices, such as when starting and stopping industrial-sized electric motors or opening and closing solenoid valves. Using relays for control purposes allowed event-driven control, where actions could be triggered out of sequence, in response to external events. These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence cam timers. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a lock bolt needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the lock bolt could not be released until the <b>safety</b> <b>gates</b> had already been closed.|$|R
