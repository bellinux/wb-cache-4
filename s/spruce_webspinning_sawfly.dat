50|$|A {{number of}} <b>webspinning</b> <b>sawflies</b> feed on <b>spruce,</b> {{but most of}} them are rare and solitary feeders, Cephalcia fascipennis Cresson being the most common (Rose and Lindquist 1985). It {{occasionally}} causes damage to ornamental spruce trees or hedges across Canada and the northeastern United States. The larvae overwinter in cells in the ground and pupate in the spring. The adults soon emerge and the female lays green cylindrical eggs singly or in end-to-end rows of 2 to 4 on the needle. On hatching, the larvae construct shelters of silk and excreta at the crotch of a twig and branch. The larvae forage from these shelters by cutting the older needles and eating them from the base outwards, usually leaving the tips of the needles which may be incorporated into the shelters. Larvae of this family typically have elongate antennae, bear a pair of jointed appendages at the posterior end, and lack abdominal legs. The colour is variable, but the head is usually dark and the body brownish with a reddish line along the back. Full-grown larvae, about 25 mm long, drop to the ground to overwinter.|$|R
