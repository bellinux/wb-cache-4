5|$|Many {{populations of}} moorland birds, {{including}} {{the black and}} red grouse live here, and the country has internationally significant nesting grounds for seabirds such as the northern gannet. The golden eagle has become a national icon, and white-tailed eagles and ospreys have recently re-colonised the land. The <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill</b> is the only endemic vertebrate species in the UK.|$|E
5|$|On {{the high}} {{mountain}} tops, species including ptarmigan, mountain hare and stoat {{can be seen}} in their white colour phase during winter months. Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist and within these areas the <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill,</b> the UK's only endemic bird species and vertebrate, can be found alongside capercaillie, Scottish wildcat, red squirrel and pine marten. Various animals have been re-introduced, including the white-tailed sea eagle in 1975, the red kite in the 1980s, and there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar. Today, much of the remaining native Caledonian Forest lies within the Cairngorms National Park and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in Argyll, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill</b> (Loxia scotica) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It is {{endemic to}} the Caledonian Forests of Scotland, {{and is the only}} vertebrate unique to the United Kingdom. The <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill</b> was confirmed as a unique species in August 2006, on the basis of having a distinctive bird song.|$|E
50|$|In future years, <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbills</b> {{could suffer}} {{from the effects of}} global warming.|$|R
5000|$|RSPB {{research}} {{showed that}} <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbills</b> have quite distinct flight and excitement calls from other crossbills [...] - [...] some even stated they have [...] "Scottish accents".|$|R
50|$|Research in Scotland {{has shown}} that red, parrot and <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbills</b> are reproductively isolated, and the {{diagnostic}} calls and bill dimensions have not been lost. They are therefore good species.|$|R

50|$|The {{forest is}} home to much {{wildlife}} including <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill,</b> crested tit, capercaillie and red deer.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} evidence {{to come from}} RSPB's long term study in the Highlands focused on discovering if the birds mate with those with a similar bill size and call, and whether young <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbills</b> inherit their bill sizes from their parents.|$|R
50|$|The {{surrounding}} {{forests of}} Caledonian pines contain many rare species, including birds {{such as the}} endangered capercaillie and the main population of twinflower - Linnaea borealis is found in Curr Wood on the southern side of the village. There are <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbills,</b> crested tits, buzzards, golden eagles and, most famously in the Dulnain Bridge area, ospreys. Red squirrels also reside in the woods.|$|R
50|$|The {{species of}} crossbills are {{difficult}} to separate, and care is needed even with the two-barred/Hispaniolan crossbill, the easiest. The other species are identified by subtle differences in head shape and bill size, and the identification problems formerly led to much taxonomic speculation, with some scientists considering that the parrot and <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbills</b> and possibly the Hispaniolan and two-barred crossbills are conspecific.|$|R
50|$|The {{forest is}} popular for {{recreation}} and contains important European wildlife, including the osprey, <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill,</b> capercaillie, crested tit and wild cat.|$|E
50|$|The {{forest is}} home to a variety of birds and mammals, {{including}} <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill,</b> red squirrel, wildcat, red deer, black grouse, crested tit and osprey. There is also a capercaillie lek.|$|E
50|$|Within its Eurasian range, {{this species}} is smaller-headed and smaller-billed than parrot {{crossbill}} and <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill,</b> so the main confusion species both {{there and in}} North America is common or red crossbill.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{difficult}} to separate from red and <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbills,</b> and plumage distinctions are negligible. It is slightly larger than other crossbills, measuring 16 to 18 cm long and spanning 27 to 31 cm across the wings. It is quite bulky and heavy weighing from 44 to 58.2 g, {{with an average of}} 53 g. The head and bill are larger than in either of the other species. The bill is thicker than those of its relatives, and the crossed tips are often not readily apparent. Extreme care is needed to identify this species. The deeper, harder choop or tyuup call is probably the best indicator.|$|R
50|$|Genetic {{research}} on their DNA failed to reveal {{any difference between}} any of the crossbills (including the morphologically distinct two-barred), with variation between individuals greater than any difference between the taxa. This led to the suggestion that limited interbreeding between the different types prevented significant genetic differentiation, and enabled each type to maintain a degree of morphological plasticity, which {{may be necessary to}} enable them to feed on different conifers when their preferred food species has a crop failure. Research in Scotland, however, has shown that the parrot and <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbills</b> are reproductively isolated, and also from the common crossbill, despite irruption of that species into their ranges, and the diagnostic calls and bill dimensions have not been lost. They are therefore good species.|$|R
50|$|Work on {{vocalisation}} in North America {{suggests that}} there are eight or nine discrete populations of red crossbill in that continent alone, which do not interbreed and are (like the named species) adapted to specialise in different conifer species. While several ornithologists seem inclined to give these forms species status, no division of the American red crossbills has yet occurred. Preliminary investigations in Europe and Asia suggest an equal, if not greater, complexity, with several different call types identified; these call types being as different from each other as from the named species <b>Scottish</b> and parrot <b>crossbills</b> - suggesting either that they are valid species, or else that the Scottish and parrot may not be.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill</b> breeds in {{the native}} Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Caledonian forests of the Scottish Highlands, but (perhaps surprisingly), often also in {{forestry}} plantations of exotic conifers, notably Larch (Larix decidua and L. kaempferi) and Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta).|$|E
50|$|This bird breeds in {{the pine}} forests of {{northwest}} Europe and into western Russia. There {{is also a}} small population in Scotland, adding {{to the difficulty of}} distinguishing it from red crossbill and the endemic <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill,</b> both of which breed within its range.|$|E
50|$|Abernethy NNR also {{supports}} a diverse population of birds, with over 70 species recorded at the Reserve. These include the <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill,</b> crested tit and capercaillie, {{which are all}} relatively rare species in Britain. Other birds present at the Reserve include buzzards, tawny owls, great spotted woodpeckers and sparrowhawks.|$|E
50|$|Of {{particular}} fame is the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) reserve at Abernethy Forest and Loch Garten. A famous pair of ospreys {{are present}} in the summer months, and they often attract large crowds to see them. The forest is home to the endangered capercaillie and endemic <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill.</b>|$|E
50|$|The British Ornithologists Union first classed the <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill</b> as a {{separate}} and distinct species in 1980, but some ornithologists believed there was insufficient scientific research for its status. It {{was considered to be}} possibly a race of either the red crossbill or the parrot crossbill, both of which also occur in the Caledonian Forest.|$|E
50|$|Many {{populations of}} moorland birds, {{including}} {{the black and}} red grouse live here, and the country has internationally significant nesting grounds for seabirds such as the northern gannet. The golden eagle has become a national icon, and white-tailed eagles and ospreys have recently re-colonised the land. The <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill</b> is the only endemic vertebrate species in the UK.|$|E
50|$|The Cairngorms {{provide a}} unique alpine semi-tundra moorland habitat, {{home to many}} rare plants, birds and animals. Speciality bird species on the plateaux include {{breeding}} ptarmigan, dotterel, snow bunting, golden eagle, ring ouzel, and red grouse, with snowy owl, twite, purple sandpiper and Lapland bunting seen on occasion. In the forests, capercaillie, black grouse, <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill,</b> parrot crossbill and crested tit are found.|$|E
50|$|Many {{populations of}} moorland birds, {{including}} blackcock {{and the famous}} red grouse, live here, and the country has internationally significant nesting grounds for seabirds such as the northern gannet. The golden eagle has become a national icon, and white-tailed eagles and ospreys have recently re-colonised the land. The <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill</b> is the only endemic vertebrate species in the British Isles.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill</b> is {{extremely}} difficult to separate from the red and parrot, and plumage distinctions are negligible. The head and bill size is intermediate between and overlapping extensively with the other two, and extreme care is needed to identify this species. The metallic jip call is probably the best indicator, but even this needs to be recorded and analysed on a sonogram to confirm the identity.|$|E
50|$|The crossbills are characterised by the mandibles {{crossing}} {{at their}} tips, {{which gives the}} group its English name. They are specialist feeders on conifer cones, and the unusual bill shape is an adaptation to assist the extraction of the seeds from the cone. The <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill</b> {{appears to be a}} specialist feeder on the cones of pines (Scots pine and Lodgepole pine) and larch.|$|E
50|$|Tain & District Field Club is {{fortunate}} in its location, surrounded by rich farmland, both mixed and monoculture, firths, woodlands, rivers and lochs such as Loch Eye, an important area for wintering greylag geese and whooper swans. Other important local sites where TDFC takes an active interest have been nesting ospreys, capercaillie (Scottish Gaelic: an coileach-fraoich) strongholds, <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill</b> habitat, and extensive mudflats important for feeding wading birds.|$|E
50|$|Scotland's {{environment}} supports 62 {{species of}} wild mammals, including wild cats, grey and harbour seals {{and the most}} northernly colony of bottlenose dolphins. The black and red grouse populate Scotland's moorland and the country has significant nesting grounds for seabirds. The <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill</b> is the only endemnic vertebrate species in the UK. Scotland's seas {{are among the most}} biologically productive in the world with at least 40,000 species are estimated to live in Scottish waters. 14,000 species of insect inhabit Scotland, including rare species. The population of large mammals rapidly decreased to extinction in historic times.|$|E
5000|$|Typical of the Scottish Highlands, {{the slopes}} of the {{mountain}} are largely treeless, especially at higher altitudes. The mountain is instead clad in a variety of grasses and mosses, which towards the summit are covered by snow during parts of the year. The lower slopes are described by Muir as [...] "boggy, sodden moorland". The base of the southern side of the mountain, adjacent to Loch Affric, is wooded with Scots pine interspersed with other species such as oak, birch, and beech. These woods are inhabited by a number of endemic fauna, including the crested tit and the <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ospreys are not {{the only}} creatures to be found at Loch Garten. Capercaillies, though {{difficult}} to see, do inhabit the remoter parts of the reserve and can be seen performing their annual lek via the spring [...] "Caperwatch". Red squirrels can be seen very easily around the hide, especially on the feeders put out for them. Smaller birds such as the siskin, common chaffinch (in very large numbers) and great spotted woodpecker are also present and easy to spot on the feeders. The crested tit and <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill</b> are more reserved in their behaviour and more difficult to find. Wigeon live by and swim on the loch.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill,</b> Loxia scotica, which inhabits the {{coniferous}} {{forests of}} the Highlands, is Britain's only endemic bird and, with only 300 breeding pairs, one of Europe's most threatened species. Its shape, red/green hue and habit of hanging upside down has led to comparisons with parrots. St Kilda has a unique subspecies of wren, the St Kilda wren Troglodytes troglodytes hirtensis, which has adapted to perching on the rocks and cliffs of this treeless Atlantic island, and consequently has developed larger and stronger feet than the mainland variant. It is also slightly larger, has a longer beak, a drabber though more varied colouring, and a [...] "peculiarly sweet and soft" [...] song. The subspecies was recognised in 1884 and was protected by a special Act of Parliament in 1904 to prevent its destruction [...] "at the hands of ornithologists, egg-collectors, taxidermists and tourists".|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{difficult}} to separate from parrot crossbill and <b>Scottish</b> <b>crossbill,</b> both of which breed within its Eurasian range, as plumage distinctions from those two species are negligible, though the head and bill are smaller than in either of the other species. Care is needed in identification, especially in Eurasia, where the glip or chup call {{is probably the best}} indicator. The identification problem is less severe in North America, where only red crossbill and White-winged crossbill occur. However, there has been debate as to whether different call types should be considered separate species. For example, the South Hills crossbill, occurring in the South Hills and Albion Mountains in Idaho {{has been described as a}} new species (Loxia sinesciuris) because it shows a very low degree of hybridization with the red crossbill. There are also genetic differences between the call type populations. Nevertheless, few ornithologists have chosen to give these forms species status.|$|E

40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{in color}} and pattern of contour feathers is rare in juvenile songbirds. We describe how captive-bred juvenile males of <b>Scottish</b> <b>Crossbill</b> (Loxia scotica) and nominate Red Crossbill (L. curvirostra curvirostra) can be differentiated from females prior to prebasic molt by an unstreaked patch on the males' upper breast. There may be a functional relationship between sexual dimorphism {{and the formation of}} pair bonds or breeding while the birds are still in juvenile plumage. Sexually dimorphic Red Crossbills and Bearded Tits (Panurus biarmicus) are known to form pair bonds, and even breed successfully, while still in juvenile plumage...|$|E
