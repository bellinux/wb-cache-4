5|$|St. John's has {{traditionally}} {{been one of the}} safest cities in Canada to live; however, in recent years crime in the city has steadily increased. While nationally crime decreased by 4% in 2009, the total crime rate in St. John's saw an increase of 4%. During this same time violent crime in the city decreased 6%, compared to a 1% decrease nationally. In 2010 the total crime <b>severity</b> <b>index</b> for the city was 101.9, an increase of 10% from 2009 and 19.2% above the national average. The violent crime <b>severity</b> <b>index</b> was 90.1, an increase of 29% from 2009 and 1.2% above the national average. St. John's had the seventh-highest metropolitan crime index and twelfth-highest metropolitan violent crime index in the country in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} are officially ranked {{on one of}} five {{tropical cyclone}} intensity scales, according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basin(s) they are located in. Only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones, but some alternative scales also exist, such as accumulated cyclone energy, the Power Dissipation Index, the Integrated Kinetic Energy Index, and the Hurricane <b>Severity</b> <b>Index.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Hurricane <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> (HSI) {{is another}} scale used and rates the {{severity}} {{of all types of}} tropical and subtropical cyclones based on both the intensity and the size of their wind fields. The HSI is a 0 to 50 point scale, allotting up to 25 points for a tropical cyclone's intensity and up to 25 points for wind field size. Points are awarded on a sliding scale, with the majority of points reserved for hurricane force and greater wind fields.|$|E

30|$|Fire {{severity}} {{is defined}} as the magnitude of the ecological effect of fire on vegetation and soils. While particular fire effects can be measured in the field, fire severity typically is characterized remotely using the dNBR or similar fire <b>severity</b> <b>indices,</b> usually derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) or Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery. Hudak et al. report on the strength of relationships between several image-derived fire <b>severity</b> <b>indices</b> and individual measures of fire effects on vegetation and soils, from field plots characterized in three different ecosystems across North America. Lentile et al. report on vegetation responses observed at these same plots spanning the full range of fire severities observed, and the different patch sizes of the fire severity classes for the three ecosystems sampled. In southern California, Lewis et al. focus on soil effects, and compare the utility of fire <b>severity</b> <b>indices</b> derived from Landsat to estimates of soil erosion potential and hydrological response derived from hyperspectral imagery.|$|R
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how to classify the severity of psoriasis. Mild psoriasis {{has been defined as}} a percentage of body surface area (BSA)≤10, a Psoriasis Area <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> (PASI) score ≤10, and a dermatology life quality index (DLQI) score ≤10. Moderate to severe psoriasis was defined by the same group as BSA >10 or PASI score >10 and a DLQI score >10. The DLQI is a 10 question tool used to measure the impact of several dermatologic diseases on daily functioning. The DLQI score ranges from 0 (minimal impairment) to 30 (maximal impairment) and is calculated with each answer being assigned 0–3 points with higher scores indicating greater social or occupational impairment.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carla {{ranks as}} the most intense U.S. {{tropical}} cyclone landfall on the Hurricane <b>Severity</b> <b>Index.</b> The third named storm and first Category5 hurricane of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season, Carla developed from an area of squally weather in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September3. Initially a tropical depression, it strengthened slowly while heading northwestward, and by September5, the system was upgraded to Tropical Storm Carla. About 24hours later, Carla was upgraded to a hurricane. Shortly thereafter, the storm curved northward while approaching the Yucatán Channel. Late on September7, Carla entered the Gulf of Mexico while passing just northeast of the Yucatán Peninsula. By early on the following day, the storm became a major hurricane after reaching Category3 intensity. Resuming its northwestward course, Carla continued intensification and on September11, it was upgraded to a Category5 hurricane. Later that day, Carla weakened slightly, but was still a large and intense hurricane when the storm made landfall near Port O'Connor, Texas. It weakened quickly inland and {{was reduced to a}} tropical storm on September12. Heading generally northward, Carla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September13, while centered over southern Oklahoma. Rapidly moving northeastward, Carla's remnants reached the Labrador Sea, Canada and dissipated on September17,1961.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether there are underlying dimensions common among traditional traumatic brain injury (TBI) <b>severity</b> <b>indices</b> and, if so, the extent to which they are interchangeable when predicting short-term outcomes. This study had an observational design, and took place in United States trauma centers reporting to the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB). The sample consisted of 77, 470 unweighted adult cases reported to the NTDB from 2007 to 2010, with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD- 9 -CM) TBI codes. There were no interventions. <b>Severity</b> <b>indices</b> used were the Emergency Department Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) Total score and each of the subscales for eye opening (four levels), verbal response (five levels), and motor response (six levels); the worst Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) severity score for the head (six levels); and the worst Barell index type (three categories). Prediction models were computed for acute care length of stay (days), intensive care unit length of stay (days), hospital discharge status (alive or dead), and, if alive, discharge disposition (home versus institutional). Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) indicated a two dimensional relationship among items of <b>severity</b> <b>indexes.</b> The primary dimension reflected overall injury severity. The second dimension seemed to capture volitional behavior without the capability for cogent responding. Together, they defined two vectors around which most of the items clustered. A scale that took advantage of the order of items along these vectors proved to be the most consistent index for predicting short-term health outcomes. MCA provided useful insight into the relationships among components of traditional TBI <b>severity</b> <b>indices.</b> The two vector pattern may reflect the impact of injury on different cortical and subcortical networks. Results are discussed in terms of score substitution and the ability to impute missing values. CC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2015 - 12 - 14 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 24521197 PMC 467738...|$|R

40|$|Three {{eastern hemlock}} (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.) and three {{chestnut}} oak (Quercus prinus L.) ring-width chronologies were constructed from old-and second-growth {{stands in the}} Black Rock Forest in Cornwall. New York, the first developed for the highlands of southeastern New York State. The longest hemlock chronology extends from 1780 - 1992 and the longest oak chronology from 1806 - 1994. The oldest trees sampled had minimum ages of 275 and 300 years for hemlock and chestnut oak, respectively. The tree-ring chronologies were compared to monthly temperature and precipitation data from nearby West Point, NY for the 1850 s- 1990 s and to Palmer Drought <b>Severity</b> <b>Indices</b> for 1911 - 1990. The chronologies provide forest growth information for the period prior to the initiation of meteorological measurements, begun in 1824 at West Point. Black Rock Forest eastern hemlock growth correlates positively with current July and prior September precipitation, with February-March temperature and with prior September Palmer Drought <b>Severity</b> <b>Indices.</b> It correlates negatively with prior June temperature. Black Rock Forest chestnut oak growth correlates positively with current June-July and prior September and December precipitation, with January temperature, and with prior September-October and current June-July Palmer Drought <b>Severity</b> <b>Indices.</b> It correlates negatively with current June-July temperature.
