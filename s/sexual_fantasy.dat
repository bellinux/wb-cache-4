25|$|Philip was a 38-year-old {{professional}} man {{referred to}} the author's clinic for assessment....Philip began masturbating at puberty, which occurred at age 12 or 13. The earliest <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> he could recall was that of having a woman's body. When he masturbated, he would imagine {{that he was a}} nude woman lying alone in her bed. His mental imagery would focus on his breasts, his vagina, the softness of his skin, and so on—all the characteristic features of the female physique. This remained his favorite <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> throughout his life.|$|E

50|$|Deviant and sadistic <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> are {{believed}} to be the underlying risk factors for sexual crimes. 70-85% of sexual offenders extensively engage in deviant <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies,</b> and certain themes can be attributed to types of sex crimes. For example, serial sexual murderers have more rape <b>fantasies</b> than non-serial <b>sexual</b> murderers and 82% of offenders that use a weapon engage violent <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies.</b> Offenders that report deviant <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> have also been found to be more dangerous than offenders that do not.|$|R

40|$|This book {{expands the}} notion of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> {{from the field of}} {{psychology}} into the realms of cultural studies, anthropology, philosophy, and sociology. So far, much research on <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> has dealt with issues of gender differences, the effect of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> on people’s lives, or how problematic fantasies can be treated in therapy. In this volume contributors from different academic disciplines explore <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> at the convergence of the cultural and the individual, taking into account that fantasies are paradoxical: highly individualised and private, {{and at the same time}} dependent on a world that supplies structures, images, symbols, and narratives...|$|R
25|$|Many couples {{incorporate}} bondage {{into their}} sex lives, often sporadically but sometimes more regularly, and find sexual bondage to be relationship-affirming. This sometimes {{takes the form}} of a sex game or <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> enactment. Bedroom bondage games are commonly used as a form of foreplay. They require and imply a level of trust and a surrender of control by the restrained to the active partner. The restrained partner (called a bottom) surrenders control to the other partner (called a top). This surrender of control happens voluntarily and under mutual understanding and consent.|$|E
25|$|The Satyricon of Petronius Arbiter (later {{made into}} a film by Fellini) is an ancient Roman novel, which has {{partially}} survived, narrating the misadventures of an impotent man named Encolpius, who has been cursed by the god Priapus. The novel is filled with bawdy and obscene episodes, including orgies, ritual sex, and other erotic incidents. The discovery of several fragments of Lollianos's Phoenician Tale reveal that a genre of picaresque erotic novel also existed in ancient Greece. Meanwhile, some of the ancient Greek romance novels, such as Daphnis and Chloe, also contain elements of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy.</b>|$|E
25|$|In one study, {{psychiatric}} {{patients were}} found to have a statistically significant higher prevalence rate (55 percent) of reported bestiality, both actual sexual contacts (45 percent) and <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> (30 percent) than the control groups of medical in-patients (10 percent) and psychiatric staff (15 percent). Crépault and Couture (1980) reported that 5.3 percent of the men they surveyed had fantasized about sexual activity with an animal during heterosexual intercourse. In a 2014 study, 3% of women and 2.2% of men reported fantasies about having sex with an animal. A 1982 study suggested that 7.5 percent of 186 university students had interacted sexually with an animal.|$|E
50|$|Deviant <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> are <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> {{which involve}} illegal, nonconsensual, and sadistic themes. While people with {{paraphilia}} have deviant <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies,</b> {{it is important}} to note that deviant <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> are not atypical and/or paraphilic. DSM-5 defines paraphilia as intense and persistent atypical preferences for sexual activities or targets like spanking, whipping, binding with erotic targets like children, animals, and/or rubber etc. While DSM-5 recognizes that paraphillias don’t have to be pathological, psychiatrists still find it difficult to differentiate between paraphilic interests and paraphilic disorders, because the concept of normal of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> is subjective. It is based on factors like history, society, culture and politics. For example, masturbation, oral, anal and homosexual sex were illegal in some American states and even considered to be paraphilic disorders in earlier DSM revisions.|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> in future risk and {{treatment}} response among sexual offenders {{has long been}} known. However, as we develop objective self-report measures of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies,</b> response bias is becoming an increasing concern. In examining a sample of institutionalized sex offenders, the present study suggests that offenders’ responses on these measures are prone to response bias, the bias does not negate their associations with other self-report measures of sexual deviance, and relationship of their <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> {{does not appear to}} relate to actual behavioral indications. Clinical and research implications for these findings are discussed...|$|R
25|$|The church teaches what {{it calls}} the law of chastity, a moral code that its members must follow {{to be in good}} {{standing}} with the church. At its core, the law of chastity prohibits sexual relations between individuals who are not married, adultery, and sexual relations between gay and lesbian partners whether married or not. The law also prohibits other sexual behavior, such as bestiality and masturbation, as well as mental behavior such as lust, <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy,</b> and viewing of pornography. The church's teachings are ambiguous about the scope of allowable sexual behavior between legally married couples. Sex in marriage is seen as a means for expressing and building joy, unity, love, and oneness, as well as for producing children.|$|E
25|$|Most pornographic {{films are}} {{directed}} at a heterosexual male viewer, {{and the primary}} focus and most on-screen time is on the women in them. Pornographic films attempt to present a <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> and actresses are selected {{on their ability to}} create or fit that fantasy. Many times the fantasy can be an actress' physical features and appearance, such as figure, breast size, hair style, ethnicity, as well as on her willingness and expertise in performing particular sex acts. Actresses are required to present a positive attitude to on-screen sexual performance with all sex acts being presented as enjoyable and joyfully entered into. Actresses are usually presented as always being available and willing to engage in any sex acts that their on-screen partner, as the proxy of the viewer, wishes.|$|E
25|$|Several studies {{comparing}} bisexuals with hetero- or homosexuals {{have indicated}} that bisexuals have higher rates of sexual activity, fantasy or erotic interest. Van Wyk and Geist (1984) found that male and female bisexuals had more <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> than heterosexuals. Dixon (1985) found that bisexual men had more sexual activities with women than did heterosexual men. Bisexual men masturbated more but had fewer happy marriages than heterosexuals. Bressler and Lavender (1986) found that bisexual women had more orgasms per week and they described them as stronger than those of hetero- or homosexual women. They also found that marriages with a bisexual female were happier than heterosexual unions, observed less instance of hidden infidelity, and ended in divorce less frequently. Goode and Haber (1977) found bisexual women to be sexually mature earlier, masturbate and enjoy masturbation more and to be more experienced in different types of heterosexual contact.|$|E

25|$|Critic Randy Rasmussen {{suggests}} that the character of Bill is fundamentally more naïve, strait-laced, less disclosing and more unconscious of his vindictive motives than his counterpart, Fridolin. For Rasmussen and others, the film's Bill Harford is essentially sleep-walking through life with no deeper awareness of his surroundings. In the novella, when his wife discloses a private <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy,</b> he in turn admits {{one of his own}} (of a girl in her mid to late teens), while in the film he is simply shocked. The film's argument over whether he has fantasies over female patients and whether women have sexual fantasies is simply absent from the novella, where both husband and wife assume the other has fantasies. In the film, Bill's estrangement from Alice revolves around her confessing a recent fantasy to him; in the novella, both exchange fantasies, after which she declares that in her youth she could have easily married someone else, which is what precipitates their sense of estrangement.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{then said}} she was [...] "doing this to {{liberate}} America — free us all of our hang-ups". She told Spin magazine [...] "We live in a very repressed society, and I deal with erotic themes. The point I try to make is: Why should we feel ashamed of our sexuality?". Later she revealed that [...] " [...] does not condone unsafe sexual practices". Nicholas Callaway from Callaway Arts & Entertainment said that the book [...] was [...] "inevitably going to be controversial. The book explores every aspect of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy.</b> It's hard to calculate the effect, , Sex should be considered 'art'". Originally it was rumored that Time Warner was nervous about {{the release of the}} book; however, in an interview with Vanity Fair, William Sarnoff, president of Warner Books, said he felt that Madonna [...] "should pursue all avenues of creativity as she defines it". The Warner company had also previously assured that they would make sure Sex reached its main target audience and also reminded that the book was safely wrapped in a Mylar bag to prevent in-store peeping and contained a warning label. Michael Kilian of the Chicago Tribune published an article on October 7, 1992, regarding the then upcoming release of Sex: [...] "Prepare thyself, , The mega-event of the millennium is to occur in precisely two weeks. It's an event far more mega than the November election, the collapse of communism or even the crowning of Leanza Cornett as the new Miss America." [...] Kilian also described it as the [...] "personal <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> picture book in all Christendom, then it goes far beyond all previous 'truly twisted' personal <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy</b> picture books—perhaps beyond all imagining what such a book could be".|$|E

50|$|Much {{research}} has been conducted which has highlighted several gender differences in <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies.</b> Some of the patterns which have frequently emerged include men's greater tendency to report <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> falling in the following categories: exploratory, intimate, impersonal, and sadomasochism. Exploratory fantasies include those of homosexual encounters and group sex, whilst fantasies of watching others engage in sexual intercourse and fetishism are classed as impersonal <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies.</b> Women are also likely to report fantasies involving the same-sex partner, or those with a famous person, although both sexes have been found to prefer intimate fantasies over the other three types outlined, including fantasies of oral sex and sex outdoors.|$|R
500|$|With {{its focus}} on <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy,</b> The Wood Nymph differs sharply from the Rydberg poem Snöfrid which Sibelius set in 1900. In , Gunnar, the {{patriotic}} hero, resists a water nymph's sensuous [...] "embrace" [...] to instead [...] "fight the hopeless fight" [...] for his country and [...] "die nameless". The contrast between Björn and Gunnar, Murtomäki argues, reflects Sibelius's own personal transformation: crowned a [...] "national hero" [...] following the 1899 premiere of the Symphony No. 1, Sibelius wished to demonstrate that he had [...] "outgrown his early adventurism" [...] and learned to place country before [...] "libertine" [...] excess. Murtomäki's conclusion, however, is not universally accepted. David Fanning, in his review of the edited volume in which Murtomäki's essay appears, has savaged as [...] "dubious" [...] and [...] "tendentious" [...] such autobiographical speculations. Per Fanning: [...] "For Murtomäki every half-diminished chord {{seems to be a}} Tristan chord, with all the symbolic baggage that entails...Such half-baked hermeneutics baffle and alienate...enthusiasm has occasionally been allowed to run riot".|$|E
500|$|On the {{characterization}} of Catwoman, Waters explained [...] "Sam Hamm {{went back to the}} way comic books in general treat women, like fetishy <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy.</b> I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society, a very beaten down secretary." [...] Harvey Dent appeared in early drafts of the script, but was deleted. His disfiguring appearance of Two-Face would have appeared in the climax when Catwoman kisses him with a taser to the face, which was replaced with Max Shreck. Waters quoted, [...] "Sam Hamm definitely planned that. I flirted with it, having Harvey start to come back and have one scene of him where he flips a coin and it's the good side of the coin, deciding not to do anything, so you had to wait for the next movie." [...] In early scripts Max Shreck was the [...] "golden boy" [...] of the Cobblepot family, whereas Penguin was the deformed outsider. It turned out that Shreck would be the Penguin's long-lost brother. Max Shreck was also a reference to actor Max Schreck, known for his role as Count Orlok in Nosferatu.|$|E
500|$|In California the [...] "Consenting Adult Sex Bill", {{passed in}} January 1976, made gay bathhouses and the sex {{that took place}} within them legal for the first time. During the 1970s, the two most popular gay bathhouses in San Francisco, both located in the SOMA neighborhood, were the Ritch Street Health Club at 330 Ritch St., the {{interior}} of which was designed like a Minoan palace, and The Barracks, a BDSM bathhouse at 72 Hallam near Folsom in which each room was designed to accommodate a different BDSM <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy.</b> In 1978 a group of police officers raided the Liberty Baths in the Polk Gulch neighborhood of San Francisco and arrested three patrons for [...] "lewd conduct in a public place", but the District Attorney's office soon dropped the charges against them. In 1984, however, fear of AIDS caused the San Francisco Health department, {{with the support of}} some gay activists such as Randy Shilts, and against the opposition of other gay activists, to ask the courts to close gay bathhouses in the city. The court, under Judge Roy Wonder, instead issued a court order that limited sexual practices and disallowed renting of private rooms in bathhouses, so that sexual activity could be monitored, as a public health measure. Some of the bathhouses tried to live within the strict rules of this court order, but many of them felt they could not easily do business under the new rules and closed. Eventually, the few remaining actual bathhouses succumbed to either economic pressures or the continuing legal pressures of the city and finally closed. Several sex clubs, which were not officially bathhouses, continued to operate indefinitely and operate to this day, though following strict rules under the court order and city regulations. Bathhouses themselves, however, operate just outside the city, thus outside of their laws, such as in Berkeley and San Jose.|$|E
50|$|When a {{study used}} {{statistical}} analysis and the Wilson sex fantasy questionnaire to investigate atypical fantasies, having zoophilllic or pedophillic fantasies {{were found to}} be rare and only 7 themes including urination, crossdressing, rape etc. were considered atypical. A lot of studies have also found that “atypical” <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> are quite common as indulging in greater varieties of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> increases sex-life satisfaction. For example, in 2011 study found that over half of the older men in Berlin had “atypical” <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> with 21.8% of them having sadistic fantasies-a prerequisite for sexual murders. Another study found that dominance and submission themes were extremely popular in pornographic searches.|$|R

2500|$|While {{the concept}} of sexual {{objectification}} is important within feminist theory, ideas vary widely on what constitutes sexual objectification {{and what are the}} ethical implications of such objectification.

2500|$|... iscrete lesbian or {{gay male}} identities {{in the modern}} sense - identities {{that are based on}} self-definitions and involve {{emotional}} as well as physical aspects of same sex relations - were rare. Erotic loyalty (and, in the case of women, subservience) to the opposite sex was assumed to be normal even by homosexuals. Hence, for many Cubans of this era, homosexuality was a mere addendum to customary marital roles. Among others, it was just a profitable commodification of <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasy.</b> For the vast majority, homosexuality made life a shameful and guilt-ridden experience.|$|E
5000|$|Richard C. Friedman, an {{academic}} psychiatrist {{who specializes in}} the psychodynamics of homosexuality, writes in his essay [...] "Denial in the Development of Homosexual Men" [...] that many gay men have experienced <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> about women or engaged in heterosexual sex and that many straight men have experienced <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> about men or engaged in homosexual sex. Despite being bisexual in fantasy and activity, these men identify as [...] "gay" [...] or [...] "straight" [...] rather than as bisexual. This erasure of bisexuality is sometimes caused by denying the significance of an erotic encounter {{in order to maintain}} a person's sexual identity and sense of community; a man might downplay having had <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> or encounters with a woman in order to maintain his identity as a [...] "gay man" [...] and his membership in the gay community, or a man might downplay having had <b>sexual</b> <b>fantasies</b> or encounters with a man in order to maintain his status as a heterosexual man in heteronormative society.|$|R
