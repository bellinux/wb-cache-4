40|$|ABSTRACT. Information on {{the drop}} energy from {{sprinklers}} {{is important for}} choosing the optimum sprinkler type for a particular soil. Drop size distribution data were collected for different types of <b>sprinklers</b> <b>with</b> various nozzle size-pressure combinations using a laser-optical method. Drop velocities were calculated using a trajectory model. The overall drop energy per unit of applied water was calculated. A method was developed to estimate the kinetic energy for {{a particular type of}} <b>sprinkler</b> <b>with</b> a given nozzle size and operating pressure using nozzle size and pressure head as independent variables. The volume mean drop size was found to be a good predictor of overall kinetic energy. With no wind, the overall drop energy varied from about 5 to 25 Pkg. The smooth plate spray head gave the least drop energy, while the single nozzle, impact-type sprinklers gave the greatest. Wind was found to increase drop energy by as much as a factor of three, but nozzle elevation had a small effect on drop energy. Keywords. Energy, Irrigation, Sprinklers.

40|$|Abstract. The {{kinetic energy}} of {{discrete}} drops impacting a bare soil surface is generally observed {{to lead to}} a drastic reduction in water infiltration rate due to soil surface seal formation. Under center pivot sprinkler irrigation, kinetic energy transferred to the soil prior to crop canopy development can have a substantial effect on seasonal runoff and soil erosion. In the design of center pivot irrigation systems, selection of <b>sprinklers</b> <b>with</b> minimum applied kinetic energy could potentially minimize seasonal runoff and erosion hazard. Size and velocity of drops from five common center pivot sprinklers were measured using a laser in the laboratory. The data were used to calculate kinetic energy transferred to the soil by each sprinkler on a center pivot irrigation system lateral with 2. 5 m spacing between sprinklers. Specific power, which represents the rate that kinetic energy is transferred to the soil as a function of distance from a sprinkler and analogous to a sprinkler radial water application rate distribution, was used to estimate actual kinetic energy transferred to the soil by overlapping specific power profiles of sprinklers equally spaced along a center pivot lateral. Kinetic energy of irrigation sprinklers has traditionally been characterized using area weighted kinetic energy per unit drop volume. This characterization was found not to be correlated to actual kinetic energy transferred to the soil by the sprinklers. The results demonstrated that <b>sprinklers</b> <b>with</b> the smallest drop sizes do not necessarily transfer the least kinetic energy per unit depth of water applied. Conversely, <b>sprinklers</b> <b>with</b> the largest drop sizes do not necessarily transfer the greatest kinetic energy to the soil...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. A set of drop size {{distribution}} data is presented covering {{a wide range}} of sprinkler types including single nozzle impact <b>sprinklers</b> <b>with</b> straight bore and square nozzles, and sprayheads with various types of deflector plates. Drop sizes were measured by the laser-optical method and comparisons with other types of drop size measurement techniques are presented. Distributions are parameterized with an exponential function, and a method is provided to estimate the parameters given the sprinkler type, nozzle size, and pressure head. Keywords. Irrigation, Sprinklers, Drop size. S prinkler irrigation can be defined as any irrigation system which distributes water as discrete droplets through the air. The variety of sprinkler devices available has increased dramatically in recent years, from the conventional single or double nozzle impact <b>sprinkler</b> <b>with</b> many types of nozzles to various types of deflection-plate sprinklers which influence the drop sizes and water distribution patterns over {{a wide range of}} flow rates and pressures. Accurate knowledge of drop {{size distribution}}s for sprinklers is important because evaporation and drift losses are controlled by the extreme small size ranges and drop impact energy on the soil is determined primarily by the largest size ranges. Selection of a specific sprinkler package for a sprinkler system operating on particular soil, slope, crop, and climate conditions will be aided by knowledge of the drop sizes.

The positions of the <b>sprinklers</b> <b>with</b> in the vertical computational grid of the CFD simulations have a greater influence on the activation of the sprinkler, where FDS is more sensitive than CFX.

40|$|One of {{the best}} ways for {{agriculture}} to become independent from shortages of precipitation is irrigation. In the seventies and eighties of the last century a number of large-scale sprinklers in Wielkopolska was built. At the end of 1970 ’s in the Poznan province 67 <b>sprinklers</b> <b>with</b> a total area of 6400 ha were installed. The average size of the sprinkler reached 95 ha. In 1989 there were 98 sprinklers, and the area which was armed with them was more than 10 130 ha. The study was conducted on 7 large <b>sprinklers</b> <b>with</b> the area ranging from 230 to 520 hectares in 1986 ÷ 1998. After the introduction of the market economy in the early 90 ’s and ownership changes in agriculture, large-scale sprinklers have gone under a significant or total devastation. Land on the State Farms of the State Agricultural Property Agency has leased or sold and the new owners used the existing sprinklers to a very small extent. This involved a change in crop structure, demand structure and an increase in operating costs. There has also been a threefold increase in electricity prices. Operation of large-scale irrigation encountered all kinds of barriers in practice and limitations of system solutions, supply difficulties, high levels of equipment failure which is not inclined to rational use of available sprinklers. An effect of a vision of the local area was to show the current status of the remaining irrigation infrastructure.

40|$|Centre-pivot {{irrigation}} systems {{often lead to}} runoff problems, due to the difficulty in adapting high-water application rates to soil infiltrability. To avoid such problems, {{a good understanding of}} soil infiltration characteristics and the factors that influence infiltration rate is necessary. Field tests were carried out, for 2 years, in a Mediterranean soil with different antecedent soil surface conditions and variable water application rates under a centre-pivot irrigation system. The soil infiltration rate was found to decrease not only with an increase in soil water content but also with soil surface compaction. Centre-pivot <b>sprinklers</b> equipped <b>with</b> medium grooved deflectors produced lower infiltration rate values compared to <b>sprinklers</b> <b>with</b> smooth deflectors. The increase in water application rates leads to an increase in soil infiltration rate, especially for durations of less than 25 – 30 min.
