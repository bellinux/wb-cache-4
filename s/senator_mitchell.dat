50|$|Michigan Governor James Reynolds Pryce (Tom Selleck) is {{a popular}} liberal {{politician}} who, while running {{for the office of}} the President of the United States, finds out to what a great degree his life and career are influenced by the women in his life. As a front-runner for the Democratic Party presidential candidate, Pryce owes the success of his campaign to his manager Lauren Hartman (Laura Linney) and his wife Jennifer (Nancy Travis). Pryce has not yet chosen a vice-presidential running mate and has a hard time making the decision. Senator Parker Gable (Robert Culp) was something of a mentor to Pryce in his early political career, but Gable is a womanizer which makes Pryce uncomfortable with making him the vice-presidential candidate. Nevertheless, Gable's Washington socialite wife Meg (Faye Dunaway) considers Gable to be the best choice and tries to exert pressure over Pryce to make this happen. Pryce's other choices are <b>Senator</b> <b>Mitchell</b> Morris (Bruce McGill), a lobbyist whom Pryce dislikes due to his close ties to Big Business, and Senator Terrence Randall (Bob Gunton), who is disliked by Pryce's shallow Hollywood campaign fundraising manager Shawna Morgan (Teri Hatcher). Being previously sexually involved with Lauren, Meg, and Shawna before marrying Jennifer makes listening to their advice all that much harder for Pryce. All four women are seemingly more intent on exerting control over Pryce and winning their own personal battles against each other rather than honestly trying to help him make the correct political decision.|$|E

5000|$|The NCAA {{announced}} on Monday, September 8, {{two days after}} Penn State beat Akron, that effective immediately, Penn State's ban from postseason play levied in wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal would be terminated, and that by the 2015 season, it would have its full complement of scholarships. The decision came {{in response to a}} recommendation from former United States Senator George Mitchell, Penn State's athletic integrity monitor, who concluded Penn State's current players should not be held responsible for organizational misgivings of the past. Ultimately, the NCAA's executive committee concurred, and eliminated the sanctions. Former Penn State assistant coach Jay Paterno - son of Joe Paterno, Penn State's coach for decades - lambasted the NCAA, opining that [...] "the truth of the matter," [...] is that the NCAA is utilizing the report from <b>Senator</b> <b>Mitchell</b> [...] "as cover to reduce the sanctions that were never warranted in the first place." [...] Coach James Franklin commented, [...] "We did bring the 49 guys who stayed (the remaining 49 players who were on the roster when sanctions were announced in July 2012) to the front, {{and the rest of the}} guys gave them a standing ovation. They were here for our program when we needed them most. You could even mention some of the recruits. Hackenberg and Breneman are two guys who kind of held the recruiting class together. I don't think there's any doubt that those 49 guys will forever be remembered. They didn't take a shortcut. Those guys are a perfect example of that. It's also an example that if you just work hard and keep a positive attitude and persevere, good things happen. I'm happy those 49 guys can be rewarded for the commitment they showed to this program." [...] James Franklin, September 9, 2014 ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} evaluates {{two different}} perspectives on congressional-executive relations across four major foreign policy issue areas using congressional voting from 1947 to 1988. Both a bipartisan perspective and a partisan/ideological perspective are evaluated across high politics issues-national security and foreign relations votes&mdash;and low politics issues-foreign aid and trade votes. In addition, {{we examine the}} impact of the Vietnam War on voting in each issue area. In general, we find that although high politics issues elicit more bipartisanship than low politics, party and ideology seem to account better for congressional voting across all four issue areas. The effect of the Vietnam War is to lessen bipartisanship and to exacerbate partisan and ideological divisions, especially on national security votes and somewhat less so on foreign aid votes.

40|$|Members of the Committees: Thank you for {{inviting}} me to share my views on tax reform and the tax treatment of capital gains. I am speaking for myself alone. My views should not be attributed {{to any of the}} organizations with which I am affiliated. No issue ignites such fierce passions as the taxation of capital gains. Columbia law professor Michael Graetz (1997) referred to the epic battle between President George H. W. Bush and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell as “the madness of two Georges. ” President Bush was convinced that cutting tax rates on capital gains would turbocharge the economy and actually increase tax revenues. He could not understand why Democrats in the Senate would stand in the way. <b>Senator</b> <b>Mitchell,</b> however, was convinced that cutting capital gains tax rates would simply provide an unfair windfall to the wealthiest people in society. How should capital gains be taxed? Under an income tax the answer is that capital gains should be taxed in full as they are earned, not when realized. Capital gains are income, not really different in substance from interest, rents, and royalties: other kinds of capital income that are taxed as ordinary income. Under the pure comprehensive income tax, corporate income would be allocated to shareholders and taxed as ordinary income, {{in the same way that}} S-corporations an...|$|E
