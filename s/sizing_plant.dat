40|$|Recent popular {{business}} {{literature has}} suggested {{that there is a}} significant trend in the United States for firms to decrease the size and increase the focus of manufacturing plants they operate, and that this leads to higher productivity. This paper tests empirically the validity of these claims. We analyze data on virtually the entire population of manufacturing plants in the United States and find that, contrary to the popular business literature, the average <b>size</b> of <b>plants</b> increased during the period 1972 [...] 1984. However, consistent with the popular notion, the rate of growth in <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> slowed considerably, and even turned negative for a category of large plants. Plant focus did increase during this period. We then investigate the relationship between productivity and plant characteristics including <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> and <b>plant</b> focus. Overall, our results do not support the popular argument that reduction in <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> results in productivity gains. However, we do find support for this argument in some two-digit SIC industries; also, scale economies in the entire population decreased over the period 1972 [...] 1982. We also find only limited support for the popular argument that plant focus increases productivity. focussed factory, <b>plant</b> <b>size,</b> scale, <b>plant</b> focus, productivity, manufacturing strategy...|$|R
40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>size</b> {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} to {{be a major}} driver of biotic interactions. However, it is little understood how <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> affects <b>plant</b> mutualists vs. antagonists and the plant's resulting reproductive success. We established a common garden experiment covering an interspecific <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> gradient (from 10 to 130 cm height) across 21 annual Brassicaceae species, thereby standardizing features of habitat and surrounding landscape. We assessed flower-visiting pollinators and florivores (pollen beetle adults and larvae) and the resulting effects of all these flower-visiting insects on plant reproductive success. Besides flower characteristics (<b>size,</b> abundance, color), <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> had a generally positive effect on abundance and species richness of pollinators as well as on abundance of pollen beetle adults and larvae. Pollen beetles reduced seed number as well as thousand-seed weight, whereas pollinators increased seed number only. Overall, increasing <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> led to less thousand-seed weight but had no effect on seed number, indicating counterbalancing effects of herbivory and pollination. In conclusion, seed number of large plant species should benefit from locations with many pollinators and few herbivores and small plant species' seed number from locations with few pollinators and many herbivores...|$|R

40|$|Reproductive biology, {{including}} phenology, flower biology, pollination, and {{the reproductive}} {{system in the}} bromeliad Aechmea distichantha were studied in an Araucaria forest {{in the state of}} Paraná. Phenology and reproduction in terricolous plants were followed in October 2006 and May - October of 2007. Flowering peaked from June to September and fruiting was from June to October. Flower anthesis lasted one day. Flowers were pollinated the most by the hummingbird Stephanoxis lalandi and the most common butterfly visitor was Lychnuchoides ozias ozias. Nectar concentration declined during anthesis, while nectar volume was constant. Aechmea distichantha is self-compatible with 30 - 45 % fruit formation in self-pollination tests.

40|$|Large {{plants are}} often more {{conspicuous}} and more attractive for associated animals than small plants, e. g. due to their wider range of resources. Therefore, <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> can positively affect species richness of associated animals, as shown for single groups of herbivores, but studies usually consider intraspecific <b>size</b> differences of <b>plants</b> in unstandardised environ-ments. As comprehensive tests of interspecific <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> differences under standardised conditions are missing so far, we investigated effects of <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> on species richness of all associated arthropods using a common garden experiment with 21 Brassicaceae species covering a broad interspecific <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> gradient from 10 to 130 cm height.

50|$|Pruning {{can help}} to control fruit <b>size,</b> <b>plant</b> <b>size,</b> harvest date and to simplify the {{harvesting}} of fruits. Cutting the tip of young plants leads to the desired branch height.

Light pruning leads to medium-sized, heavy pruning to large sized fruits. Basal shoots should be removed. When plants are grown in greenhouses, pruning prevents excessive vegetative growth.|$|R

40|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} that, especially in epiphytes, <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> {{has a strong}} influence on the ecophysiology of individual leaves of a plant. Extensive data sets that address this phenomenon, however, are limited to a few taxa of flowering plants. It was {{the purpose of this}} study to examine numerous physiological parameters in individuals of varying sizes of Asplenium nidus, a widespread epiphytic tropical fern, in a rain forest in northeastern Taiwan. Although stomatal dimensions and frond thickness did not vary with <b>plant</b> <b>size,</b> frond stomatal densities were higher in larger plants. Frond elemental concentration did not vary with <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> for nitrogen, magnesium, phosphorus, and sodium, while the concentrations of carbon, calcium, and potassium changed with <b>plant</b> <b>size,</b> though in different ways. The osmotic concentration of liquid expressed from the fronds did not change with <b>plant</b> <b>size,</b> nor did chlorophyll concentrations and chlorophyll a/b ratio. Fronds excised from smaller plants contained more water yet lost water at lower rates in laboratory drying experiments. Although rates of net CO 2 exchange of the fronds measured in situ in the field appeared to increase with <b>plant</b> <b>size,</b> this increase and other size-related differences in gas exchange parameters were not significant. Although some aspects of the ecophysiology of this epiphytic fern varied with changes in <b>plant</b> <b>size,</b> most physiological parameters did not.

40|$|The <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> {{distribution}} differs systematically across {{developed and}} developing countries. For example, in developing countries, less than one fifth of 1 % of plants are large (employ 100 or more employees) and account for about one fifth of total employment. In sharp contrast, in developed countries, more than 1. 6 % of plants are large and {{account for more than}} two fifth of total employment. In this dissertation, I develop a model of <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> to account for the differences in the <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> distribution observed in the data. In the first chapter, I explore the link between <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> distribution and economic development. I also discuss the main features of the <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> distribution data. The purpose of this data set is to provide evidence of systematic differences in <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> distribution across {{developed and developing}} countries.

In the third chapter, I explore how exogenous differences in aggregate barriers to investment and technology across countries affect the <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> distribution. Results indicate that exogenous differences in aggregate barriers to investment and technology across countries can account for more than 50 % of the variation in both the fraction of large plants and employment share in large plants across countries.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{protection of}} plant species is impossible without a comprehensive and thor-ough {{knowledge of their}} biology. This paper deals {{with some of the}} important aspects of the biology of two strictly protected species, Himantoglossum adriaticum and H. caprinum. The changes of the leaf area of plants were measured with a non-destructive method and the growth pattern was investigated during the vegetation period. It was also studied how the <b>plant</b> <b>size</b> of individuals changed from year to year, and what kind of connection there was between the plant condition and the flowering. Large <b>size</b> <b>plants</b> of both species were characterised by intensive growth rates in autumn and spring, their growth stopped in win-ter. Often they lost some of their leaf areas because of damage from insects (mainly in the case of H. caprinum), and frost (almost exclusively in the case of H. adriaticum). In some years the medium and small <b>size</b> <b>plants</b> were characterised by similar growth pattern to those of large size ones, but more often their growth did not stop in winter, though their growth was not so fast. The medium and small size H. caprinum individuals showed an intense autumn growth only in one vegetation period, which characterised both large size individuals of H. caprinum and all individuals of H. adriaticum.
