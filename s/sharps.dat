5|$|Besides {{being the}} focus of {{historical}} and paleontological books, the Bone Wars {{was the subject of}} the graphic novel Bone <b>Sharps,</b> Cowboys, and Thunder Lizards, by Jim Ottaviani. Bone <b>Sharps</b> is a work of historical fiction, as Ottaviani introduces the character of Charles R. Knight to Cope for plot purposes, and other events have been restructured.|$|E
5|$|Within four days, 2,300 men had {{answered}} Ellsworth's call. A selection {{of only the}} most desirable men cut that number to 1,100, which was considered a regiment's full strength. When the state {{could not afford to}} supply the new troops, fundraisers were successful in raising $60,000 for the regiment, enough to provide uniforms, several different models of <b>Sharps</b> rifles, and provisions.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to minor {{issues with the}} art, some reviewers, including Entertainment Weeklys Tom Russo, felt that more fiction {{could have been used}} in the mostly non-fiction writing. Due to the historical background of the book, Bone <b>Sharps</b> has been used in schools, as part of a study testing the effects of using comic books to educate young children. Since the release of the graphic novel, Ottaviani has published other slightly fictionalized historical stories, including Levitation: Physics and Psychology in the Service of Deception and Wire Mothers: Harry Harlow and the Science of Love.|$|E

5|$|Bone <b>Sharps,</b> Cowboys, and Thunder Lizards: A Tale of Edward Drinker Cope, Othniel Charles Marsh, and the Gilded Age of Paleontology (2005) is {{a graphic}} novel written by Jim Ottaviani and {{illustrated}} by the company Big Time Attic. The book tells a slightly fictionalized account of the Bone Wars, a period of intense excavation, speculation, and rivalry {{which led to a}} greater understanding of dinosaurs in the western United States. This novel is the first semi-fictional work written by Ottaviani; previously, he had taken no creative license with the characters he depicted, portraying them strictly according to historical sources.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to drawbars, many Hammond tonewheel organ models also include presets, which make predefined drawbar combinations {{available at the}} press of a button. Console organs have one octave of reverse colored keys (naturals are black, <b>sharps</b> and flats are white) {{to the left of}} each manual, with each key activating a preset; the far left key (C), also known as the cancel key, de-activates all presets, and results in no sound coming from that manual. The two right-most preset keys (B and B) activate the corresponding set of drawbars for that manual, while the other preset keys produce preselected drawbar settings that are internally wired into the preset panel.|$|E
5|$|In many early western {{films and}} literature, Native Americans were often portrayed as savages; having {{conflicts}} and battles against gunfighters and white settlements. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), {{an estimate of}} 19,000 white men, {{women and children were}} killed while the Indians killed numbered between 30,000 and 45,000 casualties during the American Indian Wars. Gunfighters in history did fight Native Americans. Among them was civilian Billy Dixon, who made one of the longest recorded sniper kills, by shooting an Indian off his horse almost a mile away with his <b>Sharps</b> rifle, during a standoff in the Second Battle of Adobe Walls.|$|E

5|$|The first {{train on}} the new railway line ran on 30 June 1904, and the new station at Ruislip opened on 4 July. The area became popular with ramblers, who would head to the Ruislip Lido, and general day-trippers who sought out the countryside. Local {{residents}} in Ruislip established their own tea gardens, which they advertised for the visitors. In particular, the Poplars, a Georgian house built in 1774 {{on the corner of}} the High Street and Ickenham Road, opened a tea garden in the grounds. It was eventually demolished in 1929 to make way for shops. A similar establishment was opened in light of the new railway on the corner of <b>Sharps</b> Lane, known as the Orchard Bungalow. It was eventually expanded and became The Orchard Hotel.|$|E
5|$|In his 1917 piece The Tides of Manaunaun, Cowell {{introduced}} a new notation for tone clusters on the piano and other keyboard instruments. In this notation, only {{the top and bottom}} notes of a cluster, connected by a single line or a pair of lines, are represented. This developed into the solid-bar style seen in the image on the right. Here, the first chord—stretching two octaves from D2 to D4—is a diatonic (so-called white-note) cluster, indicated by the natural sign below the staff. The second is a pentatonic (so-called black-note) cluster, indicated by the flat sign; a sharp sign would be required if the notes showing the limit of the cluster were spelled as <b>sharps.</b> A chromatic cluster—black and white keys together—is shown in this method by a solid bar with no sign at all. In scoring the large, dense clusters of the solo organ work Volumina in the early 1960s, György Ligeti, using graphical notation, blocked in whole sections of the keyboard.|$|E
25|$|Disposal methods vary {{by country}} and locale, but common methods of {{disposal}} are either by truck service or, in the United States, by disposal of <b>sharps</b> through the mail. Truck service involves trained personnel collecting <b>sharps</b> waste, and often medical waste, {{at the point}} of generation and hauling it away by truck to a destruction facility. Similarly, the mail-back <b>sharps</b> disposal method allows generators to ship <b>sharps</b> waste to the disposal facility directly through the U.S. mail in specially designed and approved shipping containers. Mail-back <b>sharps</b> disposal allows waste generators to dispose of smaller amounts of <b>sharps</b> more economically than if they were to hire out a truck service.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the identity of the Central American species of the genus Phaenonotum <b>Sharp,</b> 1882, the type specimens of the species described by <b>Sharp</b> (1882) deposited in the David <b>Sharp</b> collection in the Natural History Museum in London have been re-examined. The following species are redescribed: Phaenonotum apicale <b>Sharp,</b> 1882, P. collare <b>Sharp,</b> 1882, P. dubium <b>Sharp,</b> 1882 (confirmed as junior synonym of P. exstriatum (Say, 1835)), P. laevicolle <b>Sharp,</b> 1882, P. rotundulum <b>Sharp,</b> 1882 and P. tarsale <b>Sharp,</b> 1882. Lectotypes are designated for P. apicale, P. collare, P. rotundulum and P. tarsale. External diagnostic characters and morphology of male genitalia are illustrated.

5000|$|<b>Sharp</b> Delany’s {{place of}} birth is in dispute. Often stated {{to have been born}} in County Monaghan, Ireland, <b>Sharp</b> Delany was likely born in Queen’s County, Ireland (present day County Laois). Ballyfin, Queen’s County, was the home of his {{paternal}} grandfather, Martin Delany, and his father, Daniel Delany, who also resided in Clonin, [...] Queen’s County.

25|$|Extreme {{care must}} be taken in the {{management}} and disposal of <b>sharps</b> waste. The goal in <b>sharps</b> waste management is to safely handle all materials until they can be properly disposed. The final step in the disposal of <b>sharps</b> waste is to dispose of them in an autoclave. A less common approach is to incinerate them; typically only chemotherapy <b>sharps</b> waste is incinerated. Steps must be taken along the way to minimize the risk of injury from this material, while maximizing the amount of <b>sharps</b> material disposed.|$|E
25|$|Health {{care workers}} are to {{minimize}} their interaction with <b>sharps</b> waste by disposing {{of it in}} a sealable container. Attempts by health care workers to disassemble <b>sharps</b> waste is kept to a minimum. Strict hospital protocols and government regulations ensure that hospital workers handle <b>sharps</b> waste safely and dispose of it effectively.|$|E
25|$|Self-locking and {{sealable}} <b>sharps</b> containers {{are made}} of plastic so that the <b>sharps</b> can not easily penetrate through the sides. Such units are designed so that the whole container can be disposed of with other biohazardous waste. Single use <b>sharps</b> containers of various sizes are sold throughout the world. Large medical facilities may have their own 'mini' autoclave in which these <b>sharps</b> containers are disposed of with other medical wastes. This minimizes the distance the containers have to travel {{and the number of}} people to come in contact with the <b>sharps</b> waste. Smaller clinics or offices without such facilities are required by federal regulations to hire the services of a company that specializes in transporting and properly disposing of the hazardous wastes.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, <b>Sharp</b> was {{inducted}} into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame. The Marsha <b>Sharp</b> Center for Student-Athletes on the campus of Texas Tech and the Marsha <b>Sharp</b> Freeway in Lubbock are both named after <b>Sharp.</b>|$|R
