40|$|A {{prominent}} critical {{problem with}} the use of adhesively bonded composite <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> in aircraft structures is their susceptibility to unpredictable failure. Any efficient and robust design approach for adhesively bonded <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> under fatigue loading should account for the damage mechanisms in the joint and this cannot be achieved without understanding damage development with initiation and propagation. Research into damage development using methodical approach were conducted on the stiffness of polymer adhesively bonded composite <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> since it is the prime physical parameter that can be measured most accurately. The research produced significant new knowledge of damage development under fatigue as strain hardening and a methodology to characterize damage initiation and propagation in adhesively bonded joints. Under uninterrupted fatigue, stiffness degradation and plasticity effects led to strain hardening of the joint adhesive until failure. But there was in-homogenous stiffness degradation in regions within the joint due to defects and anomalies so that the general stiffness degradation of the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> could be either a stiffness increase or decrease to failure. The changes in the rate of stiffness over the fatigue life of a <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> reveal three characteristic regions. Region I &amp; II marked the damage initiation life of <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> and this was (66 ± 9) % of the fatigue life for specimens tested, and Region III marked the onset of damage propagation to failure. Mean strain effect was evident in some <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> under fatigue cycle. It is shown that the damage initiation &amp; propagation life under variable and constant fatigue loading for <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> is independent of the adhesive thickness, the fatigue load application frequency, and the severity of the applied load. Damage propagation in adhesively bonded <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> was found to be a combination (1) strain hardening of the adhesive layer leading to brittle cracking o...|$|R
40|$|The {{criticality}} of disbands on the {{load-carrying capacity}} of <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> under different environmental conditions was experimentally investigated. Tests {{were conducted on}} <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> containing bondline flaws of varying lengths and locations under room-temperature (RT), cold-dry (CD) and hot-wet (HW) conditions.

In contrast, those specimens under HW condition were less sensitive to the presence of disbonds. The effects of scarf angle, adherend composite layup and support condition on the load-carrying capacity of <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> with a bondline flaw were also investigated.

However, for a repair to be certified on primary structure, the repair must be designed to address damage tolerance and fatigue strength requirements, in addition to static strength. Therefore, the criticality of bondline flaws in composite <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> is analysed within this paper using finite element analysis (FEA).

40|$|In this study, {{strength}} of epoxy adhesively bonded <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> of dissimilar adherends, namely SUS {{304 stainless steel}} and YH 75 aluminum alloy is examined on several scarf angles and various bond thicknesses under uniaxial tensile loading. Scarf angle, θ= 45 °, 60 ° and 75 ° are employed. The bond thickness, t between the dissimilar adherends is controlled to be ranged between 0. 1 and 1. 2 mm. Finite element (FE) analysis is also executed to investigate the stress distributions in the adhesive layer of <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> by ANSYS 11 code. As a result, the apparent Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus of adhesive layer in <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> {{is found to be}} 1. 5 – 5 times higher than those of bulk epoxy adhesive, which has been obtained from tensile tests. For <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> strength prediction, the existing failure criteria (i. e. maximum principal stress and Mises equivalent stress) cannot satisfactorily estimate the present experimental results. Though the measured stress multiaxiality of <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> proportionally increases as the scarf angle increases, the experimental results do not agree with the theoretical values. From analytical solutions, stress singularity exists most pronouncedly at the steel/adhesive interface corner of joint having 45 – 75 ° scarf angle.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{experimental}} tests, {{which have been}} carried out to assess the mechanical properties of Iroko wood laminates used {{for the construction of a}} large wooden sailing ship. Three-point bending tests {{have been carried out}} on different types of specimens: laminates with 3 layers @ 0 ° and without <b>scarf</b> <b>joints,</b> laminates with 3 layers @ 0 ° having the outer layers with <b>scarf</b> <b>joints,</b> and laminates with 4 layers @ 0 °/± 45 °/ 0 ° and no <b>scarf</b> <b>joints.</b> The tests have been performed in compliance with the current EN Standards. The analyses of the experimental data allowed the assessment of the mechanical properties of the laminated Iroko wood as well as the influence of <b>scarf</b> <b>joints.</b> The experimental results demonstrated that the presence of <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> only affect the strength of the glued laminate, while the stiffness properties in terms of Young modulus in bending and shear modulus, obtained applying the “method of variable support span”, remain essentially the same. The investigated laminates have been also analysed using a 3 D computed tomography and an ultrasonic phased array equipment in order to assess the dimensions of possible defects or voids in the adhesive and the dynamic modulus of elasticity. The tomographic measurements of the glue thickness explained the reason of the reduced strength of the <b>scarf</b> <b>joints,</b> due to the inhomogeneity of the glue bond-line. The value of the dynamic modulus of elasticity, obtained by the ultrasonic technique, is slightly higher than the value of the modulus of elasticity obtained by the bending tests.

Pre-straining the composite increased {{the size of the}} damage area. The work also showed that composite laminate coupons can be used to some extent to replicate the impact and damage response of composite <b>scarf</b> <b>joints.</b> For the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint,</b> the majority of the damage occurred in adherend regions rather than the adhesive region, but the adhesive damage increased as the pre-strain increased, ultimately leading to catastrophic failure. Most importantly, delamination propagation along the lower 45 &deg; ply toward the bondline was found to introduce bondline failure in the interface of the adhesive and adherend. Detailed numerical validation of the experimental results was carried out. A 3 D model was developed to validate delamination in the damaged laminate coupons and delamination and bondline damage in the adhesive layer.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites as a primary structural material leads to a need for repairs of such structures. One such repair method is the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint,</b> an adhesive joint that allows for the original surface profile of a structure to be maintained. Studies of <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> have primarily considered an idealized version of the configuration, whereas there will be imperfections that arise during manufacture and installation of a real <b>scarf</b> <b>joint.</b> Parametric studies that consider <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> configurations have generally considered only the linear behavior of the adhesive material, although adhesive materials typically have large nonlinear capability. Finally, in studies of <b>scarf</b> <b>joints,</b> only the stress state in the adhesive tends to be considered. In this work, the stress and strain states in both the adherends and in the adhesive are studied for imperfect <b>scarf</b> <b>joints</b> via finite element analyses. Seven parameters that characterize different imperfections, with two to four values each, are studied and compared to the baseline configuration, which is an idealized <b>scarf</b> <b>joint,</b> for the case of linear behavior of the adhesive. One to two values of each parameter are studied for the case of nonlinear behavior of the adhesive. The parameters investigated are tip bluntness, through-thickness patch offset, mismatched adherend thickness, mismatched scarf angle, adhesive thickness variation, rotated patch adherend, and delamination in the patch. The imperfections are applied {{to one of the}} adherends. The resulting strains of the different configurations are presented for the adhesive and adherends. The yield progressions are presented for the nonlinear behavior. Results show that the nonlinear behavior case can be estimated from the results of the linear behavior. The onset of yield occurs at the location of maximum strain and is primarily associated with shear strain. The yield typically occurs at the sharp adherend tip, and failure typically coincides with the location of the onset of yield. The full nonlinear behavior of the adhesive needs to be considered for any complete study of failure. The effects of imperfections are both local and global in nature for the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> configuration. There is an effect on the global strain response as a result of load eccentricity due to asymmetry that leads to bending and other overall equilibrium considerations, while local effects are manifested in the strain fields near the imperfection. The tip bluntness parameter, adherend rotation parameter, and delamination parameter are found to have the most significant effects on the response of the <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> configuration in both the adhesive and adherend due to the specifics of the local strain field due to the imperfections. All other parameters have reduced effects on the behavior that are a result of global bending and resulting changes in the overall length of the joint. Key lengthscales are identified for imperfections and for overall joint behavior. Recommendations for further work are presented. by Holly K. Jeffrey. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|<b>Scarf</b> <b>joints</b> are an {{effective}} method of bonding thick composite laminates for {{applications such as}} the repair of composite aircraft structures.

40|$|A {{request of}} {{material}} change when performing repairs on composite parts of SAABs JAS 39 Gripen has {{lead to the}} initiation of this project. The aim {{is to create a}} quicker and more robust repair method. The requested method of repair is to use a direct-cured repair patch made of CFRP fabric instead of CFRP tape and to mount the patch with a <b>scarf</b> <b>joint,</b> see Figure 1. 1. The fabric patch should then provide a robust quasi-isotropic repair, where the operator not is dependent of complete design data such as ply-directions etc. Today tape repairs are made on tape laminate and fabric repairs made on fabric laminate. The new method is to repair tape laminate with a fabric patch. This project will evaluate the possibility of implementing this method. The work started with a literature study to find out how repairs in composite parts of the airframe are being performed today. SAABs in-house analytical tools were then used to try to predict the results and examine some of the details in the questions at issue. Finite element models were then constructed to simulate a previous physical test program conducted to validate a repair method using a step joint and a direct-cured repair patch. If the FE models could show similar results as the physical tests the results from the FE models then can be assumed to be credible. The results of this project indicate that the change from fabric to tape in the repair patch can be done without disturbing the load path of a quasi isotropic composite laminate. Fabric repairs in orthotropic composite plates results in a knock-down of about 40 %. The use of a <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> instead of a step joint should also work well as the repair patches show similar strains in the centre of the patches. The difference between step <b>joint</b> and <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> is the strain {{near the edge of the}} patch. It increases with <b>scarf</b> <b>joint</b> and it may lead to an earlier fibre failure in the repair patch.
