Another goal is to bring suggestions for improvement {{that will lead to}} increasing to the efficiency of human capital. The thesis consists of two parts. The theoretical part provides information from the Czech and foreign literature. Knowledge of theoretical part is then applied to the practical part. Basic information about the company is included in the practical part and comparison with competing businesses is also mentioned. But the most attention is paid to the performance of human capital, which is measured by labour productivity. Two indicators are selected for the calculation of labour productivity - sales and added value. Both indicators are compared in two ways; the first is average number of employees and the <b>second</b> <b>personnel</b> costs.

40|$|The {{requirements}} for e-selection technology {{to be of}} practical use for Company T have been investigated. Company T’s main business is in identifying and <b>seconding</b> <b>personnel,</b> especially in the technical sector, {{and it had been}} anticipating a shortage in the supply of candidates. This served as the initial problem definition for this research. In order to cope with the expected situation, speed and accuracy were seen as of major importance in adopting e-selection. Using interviews, eleven issues were identified across two topics: namely, the use of web-based technologies, i. e., speed, and the use of personal characteristics, i. e., accuracy. These eleven potential problems were ranked using a focus group. Then, based on contemporary literature, solutions were proposed to counter these problems. Combining these solutions has led to a design in which it is proposed that valid psychological instruments should be applied and interpreted by skilled professionals. Further, extensive knowledge sharing is seen as vital when dealing with the large amount of tacit knowledge associated with the work at Company T. Finally, it was concluded that the web-based technologies should primarily support the core day-to-day work activities rather than be user-friendly or provide additional functionality...|$|R

50|$|One of {{his early}} papers “Why is there Mandatory Retirement” (Journal of Political Economy, 1979) {{is one of the}} first papers on {{implicit}} incentive pay under asymmetric information - subjects that have since been studied profusely. He explains that companies write implicit contracts in which they pay their employees less when they are young and more than they are old. To cap the amount they will have to pay, companies need mandatory retirement rules. A <b>second</b> <b>personnel</b> economics paper is “The Peter Principle: A Theory of Decline” (Journal of Political Economy, 2004). The original Peter Principle argued that people are promoted to their level of incompetence. Lazear presents an alternative view. Instead, he argues that people are promoted only after a standard of performance has been met, and regression to the mean implies that future performance will be lower, on average. This theory extends to other situations: for example, it addresses why movie sequels are worse than original films.One puzzle in personnel economics is why we see so many incentive pay schemes in which a group is paid for their output, rather than an individual. In many firms, production is team-based, so it is natural to measure and reward team output. The often identified problem is that there are free-riders - some will shirk with team rewards. Kandal and Lazear in “Peer Pressure and Partnerships,” (Journal of Political Economy, 1992) suggest that firms have it in their interest to set norms of behavior in which workers monitor each other (through peer pressure) when the firm cannot monitor individuals.|$|R

In 1957, a Naval Non-Commissioned Officer School was established at Massawa as well. A Frogman/Diving School for the training of a special commando unit and a Ratings' Training Establishment for the training of naval enlisted men also were established at Massawa by the late 1950s or early 1960s. Centers to provide enlisted men with training in technical specialities were established at Aseb, Asmara, and Massawa.|$|R
