5|$|Usually, {{the mother}} does not {{integrate}} {{herself and her}} cubs back into the pride until the cubs are <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>weeks</b> old. Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, however, particularly if other lionesses have given birth {{at about the same}} time. For instance, lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles and there is communal raising and suckling of the young (once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. The synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size, and thus have an equal chance of survival, and older cubs do not dominate the sucklings.|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} of {{failure to thrive}} in infancy is an important goal in routine surveillance of children. Failure to thrive is normally identified by slow weight gain, but is associated with feeding problems, and may lead to developmental delay and enduring intellectual defects. The prevention of these consequences is likely to depend on earlier {{detection of}} the condition than is currently achieved using traditional methods. An experimental computer based early screening method {{for the detection of}} failure to thrive was implemented in a two-year birth cohort (1, 966 infants) in 18 general practices in the Easington area. The methods utilised an ACCESS database incorporating the British 1995 growth reference, which was used to convert the infant’s weight to a z score (conditional on age and sex). A 'thrive index' (a z score for weight gain conditional on age, sex and birth weight) was then calculated for the period from birth <b>to</b> the <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>to</b> <b>week</b> check and the infants in the slowest growing 5 % automatically identified. The projected number of births in the 18 practices over the period 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2003 was 1800, and the actual number identified from health visitors' birth registers was 1966. For the 1966 infants, records of both a birth weight and a <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>week</b> weight were identified for 1880 infants. One hundred and twenty one infants met the criteria for FTT over this period (thrive index <- 1. 17) and of these, 102 term singletons were eligible to be recruited to the study. Those who participated had their development and weight gain followed to one year of age. Infants were tested at four months and again at nine months using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (2 nd ed). Mental development index (MDI) scores and psychomotor development index (PDI) scores of case infants and controls were compared and a mean difference was found between cases and controls in MDI scores at four months of 3. 52 which was statistically significant. The mean difference in PDI scores at four months was 3. 59, which was also statistically significant. At nine months the mean difference in MDI scores was 2. 26 and the mean difference in PDI scores at nine months was 2. 25, which was not statistically significant in either case. Information about demographic characteristics, health and feeding behaviour was obtained by using a structured questionnaire with the mothers. There were no statistically significant differences between families of case and control infants in indicators of affluence such as home or car ownership, nor were there any statistically significant differences between their mothers in their levels of educational achievement. There were no statistically significant differences between cases and controls in whether infants had ever been breast fed. Case group infants, however, {{were significantly more likely to}} be slow feeders than controls, and were more likely to take only small quantities and to be weak suckers. They were also more likely to be described by their mothers as having feeding problems. The screening method described provides a practical procedure for weight screening at the <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>week</b> check that allows identification of children who fail to thrive in the early weeks of life...|$|R
5|$|By late 1940 {{there were}} severe {{shortages}} of pilots and wireless operators/gunners, with 100 pilots and 200 other personnel required.

It now took no longer than a month compared with the <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>weeks</b> considered necessary. This {{reduced the number of}} fit pilots, and the quality of pilots overall. The number of unfit pilots was recorded at 374. To cope with the shortening of training, it had to have a well-stocked general training programme. Coastal Command did not possess such an administration. Only 24 pupils were graduating when the minimum requirement was 64. This was compensated by the removal of gunnery and bombing training and a reduction in night and formation flying. Still, Bomber Command received most of the 36,000 aircrew between 1940 and 1942. Entry requirements for crews were relaxed and the programmes found more recruits that way. Manpower was also supplemented by the Commonwealth with Canada providing some of the 6,500 personnel sought by the Air Ministry. By the end of 1941, the operational strength of Coastal Command increased by seven squadrons.|$|E

Aminosalicylic acid (ASA) compounds and corticosteroids remain the mainstay of medical therapy. Aminosalicylates are recommended for therapy of mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis and for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. The role of 5 -ASA preparations in Crohn's disease is less clear. In granulomatous colitis, 5 -ASA therapy is recommended. With the development of new delivery systems, the role for 5 -ASA in the treatment of small bowel Crohn's disease is under investigation.

5|$|The {{quality of}} Malvern water is {{attributable}} to its source. Malvern Hills are amongst the oldest and hardest rocks found in the United Kingdom, with their geology responsible {{for the quality of}} Malvern's spring water. The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock, the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via fissures. Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock. When the fissures are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 litres (8 gallons) per minute to over 350 litres (77 gallons) per minute. The water permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, {{while at the same time}} the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for all the water that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows <b>six</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>weeks</b> after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.|$|E

Methods <b>Six</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> <b>week</b> old female C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were exposed to 2 Gy of whole body γ radiation and mammary glands were surgically removed 2 -month after radiation.

Autofluorescence spectra were recorded for each animal of the experimental groups on 0, 5, 10, 30, 45 and 60 days post-wounding, by exciting the granulation tissue/skin with 325 nm He-Cd laser. The variations in the average collagen intensities from the granulation tissue/skin of mice were inspected {{as a function of}} age and gender. Further, the spectral findings of the collagen synthesis in wound granulation tissue/un-wounded skin tissues were validated by Picro-Sirius red- polarized light microscopy in a blinded manner through image analysis of the respective collagen birefringence. The in vivo autofluorescence studies have shown a significant increase in collagen synthesis in laser treated animals as compared to the un-illuminated controls. Image analysis of the collagen birefringence further authenticated the ability of autofluorescence in the objective monitoring of collagen in vivo. Our results clearly demonstrate the potential of lase...|$|R
