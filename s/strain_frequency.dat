The main challenge with adaptive filters is their narrow bandwidth such that some modes will fall outside its narrow notch. These modes will thus not be adequately suppressed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A bi-level damage {{detection}} algorithm that utilizes dynamic {{responses of the}} structure as input and neural network (NN) as a pattern classifier is presented. The signal anomaly index (SAI) is proposed to express the amount {{of changes in the}} shape of frequency response functions (FRFs) or <b>strain</b> <b>frequency</b> response function (SFRF). SAI is calculated by using the acceleration and dynamic strain responses acquired from intact and damaged states of the structure. In a bi-level damage identification algorithm, first the presence of damage is identified from the magnitude of the SAI value. Then the location of the damage is identified using the pattern recognition capability of the NN. The proposed algorithm is applied to an experimental model bridge to demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm. Numerically simulated signals are used for training the NN, and experimentally acquired signals are used to test the NN. The results of this example application suggest that the SAI based pattern recognition approach may be applied to the structural health monitoring system for a real bridge.

40|$|Bone is {{subjected}} in vivo to {{both high}} amplitude, low <b>frequency</b> <b>strain,</b> incurred by locomotion, and to low amplitude, broad <b>frequency</b> <b>strain.</b> The biological effects of low amplitude, broad <b>frequency</b> <b>strain</b> are poorly understood. To evaluate {{the effects of}} low amplitude <b>strains</b> ranging in <b>frequency</b> from 0 to 50 Hz on osteoblastic function, we seeded MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells into collagen gels and applied the following loading protocols for 3 min per day for either 3 or 7 days: (1) sinusoidal strain at 3 Hz, with 0 - 3000 microstrain peak-to-peak followed by 0. 33 s resting time, (2) "broad frequency vibration" of low amplitude strain (standard deviation of 300 microstrain) including frequency components from 0 to 50 Hz, and (3) sinusoidal strain combined with broad frequency vibration (S + V). The cells were harvested on day 4 or 8. We found that the S + V stimulation significantly repressed cell proliferation by day 8. Osteocalcin mRNA was up-regulated 2. 6 -fold after 7 days of S + V stimulation, and MMP- 9 mRNA was elevated 1. 3 -fold after 3 days of vibration alone. Sinusoidal stimulation alone {{did not affect the}} cell responses. No differences due to loading were observed in alkaline phosphatase activity and in mRNA levels of type I collagen, osteopontin, connexin 43, MMPs- 1 A, - 3, - 13. These results suggest that osteoblasts are more sensitive to low amplitude, broad <b>frequency</b> <b>strain,</b> and this kind of strain could sensitize osteoblasts to high amplitude, low <b>frequency</b> <b>strain.</b> This suggestion implies a potential contribution of stochastic resonance to the mechanical sensitivity of osteoblasts.

40|$|Antibiotic {{treatment}} by humans generates strong viability selection for antibiotic-resistant bacterial <b>strains.</b> The <b>frequency</b> of host antibiotic use often determines {{the strength of}} this selection, and changing patterns of antibiotic use can generate many types of behaviors in the population dynamics of resistant and sensitive bacterial populations. In this paper, we present a simple model of hosts dimorphic for their tendency to use/avoid antibiotics and bacterial pathogens dimorphic in their resistance/sensitivity to antibiotic treatment. When a constant fraction of hosts uses antibiotics, the two bacterial strain populations can coexist unless host use-frequency is above a critical value; this critical value is derived as the ratio of the fitness cost of resistance to the fitness cost of undergoing treatment. When <b>strain</b> <b>frequencies</b> can affect host behavior, the dynamics may be analyzed in the light of niche construction. We consider three models underlying changing host behavior: conformism, the avoidance of long infections, and adherence to the advice of public health officials. In the latter two, we find that the pathogen can have quite a strong effect on host behavior. In particular, if antibiotic use is discouraged when resistance levels are high, we observe a classic niche-construction phenomenon of maintaining strain polymorphism even in parameter regions where it would not be expected...|$|R

Static, steady state, resonant and transient responses of the cracked plate are examined. Strain, displacement and acceleration responses without/with the crack are computed. Modal analysis is performed to determine the natural frequencies, mode shapes and strain/displacement frequency response functions. Frequency response functions without/with the crack are computed. Strain mode shapes, as well as displacement mode shapes, are obtained. The difference of the strain mode shapes between the uncracked plate and the cracked plate is calculated. Each of the parameters mentioned above is examined to determine the sensitivity of this parameter to the crack that occurs in the structure.

40|$|The {{ability to}} warp {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) meshes from known biological morphology to fit other known, predicted or hypothetical morphologies has {{a range of}} potential applications in functional morphology and biomechanics. One {{of the most challenging}} of these applications is Finite Element Analysis (FEA), a potentially powerful non-destructive tool in the prediction of mechanical behaviour. Geometric morphometrics is another typically computer-based approach commonly applied in morphological studies that allows for shape differences between specimens to be quantified and analysed. There has been some integration of these two fields in recent years. Although a number of shape warping approaches have been developed previously, none are easily accessible. Here we present an easily accessed method for warping meshes based on freely available software and test the effectiveness of the approach in FEA using the varanoid lizard mandible as a model.

The objective {{of this study was to}} assess their susceptibility to several antibiotics. Materials and methods. A total of 58 strains (16 S. pneumoniae, 19 H. influenzae and 23 M. catarrhalis) were isolated from samples collected in two paediatric centres, and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics tested by E-test. Results. Among H. influenzae isolates, 10. 5 % were resistant to ampicillin (all β-lactamase-positive), and 88. 9 % were susceptible to cefaclor. High β-lactam resistance rates (penicillin: 31. 3 % and cephalosporins: 18. 7 to 31. 3 %) had been observed among S. pneumonia strains.

40|$|Revised version {{to appear}} in MacromoleculesIn this paper, we present a {{qualitative}} analysis of the dissipative processes during {{the failure of the}} interface between a viscoelastic polymer and a solid surface. We reassess the "viscoelastic trumpet" model [P. -G. de Gennes, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 307, 1949 (1988) ], and show that, for a crosslinked polymer, the interface toughness G(V) starts from a relatively low value, G_ 0, due to local processes near the fracture tip, and rises up to a maximum of order G_ 0 (μ_∞/μ_ 0) (where μ_ 0 and μ_∞ stand for the elastic modulus of the material, respectively at low and high <b>strain</b> <b>frequencies).</b> This enhancement of fracture energy is due to far-field viscous dissipation in the bulk material, and begins for peel-rates V much lower than previously thought. For a polymer melt, the adhesion energy is predicted to scale as 1 /V. In the second part of this paper, we compare some of our theoretical predictions with experimental results about the viscoelastic adhesion between a polydimethylsiloxane polymer melt and a glass surface. In particular, the expected dependence of the fracture energy versus separation rate is confirmed by the experimental data, and the observed changes in the concavity of the crack profile are in good agreement with our simple model...|$|R

Dynamic frequency sweeps showed that, {{for any given}} solids concentration, the complex viscosity at different imposed strain amplitudes followed a unique power-law-type behavior up to the onset of strain thickening. Moreover, similar behavior was also observed in the post-transition state, i. e., the viscosities again superimposed at frequencies beyond the transition frequency. In an attempt to develop a parametric description of this behavior, both the Delaware–Rutgers rule {{and the concept of}} a critical shear stress for the onset of shear thickening in steady-state experiments were considered.
