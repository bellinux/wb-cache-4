40|$|In {{the sales}} {{area of a}} supermarket, the airflow pattern is {{different}} from the general marketplace due to its particularity in <b>shelf</b> <b>layout</b> and system zones. When something generates heat, the influence on velocity fields and temperature fields will be great. According to the analysis of measurement results of a supermarket in Harbin, factors such as relative position of supply and return air inlets, height of shelves and objects with heat generating capabilities influence the velocity fields and temperature fields. As a result of this analysis, we give some suggestions for design of air conditioning systems that consider the position of fixed supply and return air inlets, goods' <b>shelf</b> <b>layout</b> and the area system design with heat-generating objects...|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies {{effects of}} <b>shelf</b> <b>layout</b> in a {{department}} store on buyer behavior and then extends the research to cover the similar issue in layout of e-bazaars. <b>Shelf</b> <b>layout</b> –in terms of parameters which influence buyer behavior- is formulated by two variables; pattern of prices and pattern of popularity. In measuring both of these variables, a weighting system {{should be used to}} fine tune effect of distance between customer and different items in the layout which are also in the eyesight of the customer. In this study, weights are manipulated in such a way to optimize prediction power of the model. As a result, these weights determine an average span of vision for buyers. This measure can be used then in analysis to improve shelf layouts. Based on the analysis, we came to conclusion that in our case study –Shahrvand department stores – the first factor is the key determinant in customer buying decision. A rather similar result was obtained in e-bazaars case but with much greater lack of fit measure. At the end, a set of recommendations for <b>shelf</b> <b>layout</b> is developed {{based on the results of}} the research.

40|$|Consumers {{frequently}} buy {{the products}} they find most easily. This has forced manufacturers and retailers {{to invest in}} package design, <b>shelf</b> <b>layouts,</b> and expensive advertising campaigns to facilitate findability of their products. Surprisingly, there is no research in marketing that investigates how consumers localize products, which we call brand search. This dissertation investigates the brand search process and develops a statistical model that describes the eye movements of consumers while they are searching for a specific product. The proposed model uncovers the search strategies of consumers and suggests which marketing tools manufacturers and retailers may use to influence this process. ...|$|R

40|$|Allocating {{the proper}} amount of shelf space to stock keeping units [SKUs] is an {{increasingly}} relevant and difficult topic for managers. Shelf space is a scarce resource {{and it has}} to be distributed across a larger and larger number of items. It is in particular important because the amount of space allocated to a specific item has a substantial impact on the sales level of that item. This relation between shelf space and sales has been widely documented in the literature. However, besides the amount of space, the exact location of the SKU on the shelf is also an important moderator of sales. At the same time, the effectiveness of marketing instruments of an SKU may also depend on the <b>shelf</b> <b>layout.</b> In practice, retailers recognize that these dependencies exist. However, they often revert to rules of thumb to actually arrange their <b>shelf</b> <b>layout.</b> We propose a new model to optimize shelf arrangements in which we use a complete set of shelf descriptors. The goal of the paper is twofold. First of all, we aim to gain insight into the dependencies of SKU sales and SKU marketing effectiveness on the <b>shelf</b> <b>layout.</b> Second, we use these insights to improve the <b>shelf</b> <b>layout</b> in a practical setting. The basis of our model is a standard sales equation that explains sales from item-specific marketing-effect parameters and intercepts. In a Hierarchical Bayes fashion, we augment this model with a second equation that relates the effect parameters to shelf and SKU descriptors. We estimate the parameters of the two-level model using Bayesian methodology, in particular Gibbs sampling. Next, we optimize the total profit over the shelf arrangement. Using the posterior draws from our Gibbs sampling algorithm, we can generate the probability distribution of sales and profit in the optimization period for any feasible shelf arrangement. To find the optimal shelf arrangement, we use simulated annealing. This heuristic approach has proven to be able to effectively search an enormous solution space. Our results indicate that our model is able to fit and forecast the sales levels quite accurately. Next, when applying the simulated annealing algorithm to the <b>shelf</b> <b>layout,</b> we appear to be able to increase profits for all the stores analyzed. We compare our approach to commonly used shelf optimization rules of thumb. Most sensible rules of thumb also increase expected profits (although not as much as our optimization algorithm). In particular, it is beneficial to put high-margin items close to the beginning of the aisle (or the “racetrack"). Finally, we provide managerial implications and directions for further research...|$|E

The layout of the shelves {{play an important role}} in the total sales metrics for superstores since this affects the customers' shopping behaviour. This paper employed a genetic algorithm based approach to design <b>shelf</b> <b>layout</b> of superstores. The layout design problem was tackled by using a novel chromosome representation which takes many different parameters to prevent dead-ends and improve shelf visibility into consideration. Results show that the approach can produce reasonably good layout designs in very short amounts of time...|$|E
40|$|To stimulate {{sales of}} {{sustainable}} products, such as organic and fair trade products, retailers {{need to know}} whether their in-store instruments effectively enhance market shares. This study uses sales data and a multilevel modeling approach to explain the market shares of sustainable products according to <b>shelf</b> <b>layout</b> factors, price level, price promotions, and consumer demographics. It argues {{that the effect of}} these variables differs between organic versus fair trade products, as buying motives might differ, organic buyers tend to be more loyal, and price is a more informative signal of quality for organic products. Results show that the number of facings has a positive relationship with the market share of fair trade brands, but not with the market share of organic brands. The same holds for the price difference with the leading brand, which is important for fair trade brands but not for organic brands. In contrast, an arrangement of the product category by brand is associated with higher market share for organic brands but not for fair trade brands. Additionally, placement at eye level and clustering of items benefits both types of sustainable brands, whereas they appear to be not very sensitive to price promotions. Finally, higher sales of sustainable products are found in areas where the customer base is older and has a higher education level. Keywords Organic.

40|$|To stimulate {{sales of}} {{sustainable}} products, retailers {{need to know}} whether their in-store instruments effectively influence their market shares. This study uses actual sales data and a multilevel modeling approach to describe the market shares of sustainable brands according to price level, price promotions, and <b>shelf</b> <b>layout</b> factors, while controlling for the customer base and competitive environment. As expected, a price premium compared with the leading brand in a category decreases market share for sustainable brands, but the location on the shelf and {{the arrangement of the}} entire product category also influence market shares considerably. In particular, where literature has described conflicting findings for horizontal location on the shelf, in our study sustainable brands receive more market share when placed {{in the middle of the}} shelf space devoted to the category, and eye level is the best vertical position. Higher market share is observed when the entire category is arranged by brand. This study therefore suggests that where sustainable brands are located on the shelf may be just as important, if not more than, how many facings they have. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} and operationalize a new method for {{optimizing}} shelf arrangements. We {{show that there}} are important dependencies between {{the layout of the}} shelf and stock-keeping unit (SKU) sales and marketing effectiveness. The importance of these dependencies is further shown by the substantive profit gains we obtain with our proposed shelf optimization approach. The basis of our model is a standard sales equation that explains sales using item-specific marketing effect parameters and intercepts. In a Hierarchical Bayes (HB) fashion, we augment this model with a second layer that relates the effect parameters to shelf and SKU descriptors. We also take into account potential endogeneity of facings. After estimating the parameters of the two-level model using Bayesian methodology, we carefully investigate the dependencies of SKU sales and SKU marketing effectiveness on the <b>shelf</b> <b>layout.</b> Next, we search for the shelf arrangement that maximizes the expected total profit using simulated annealing (SA). We appear to be able to increase profits for all the stores analyzed, and our approach appears to outperform well-known rules of thumb. shelf management, sales models, Hierarchical Bayes, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, simulated annealing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{essence of}} nudging is {{to adapt the}} {{environment}} in which consumers make decisions to help them make better choices, without forcing certain outcomes upon them. To determine how consumers can effectively be guided to select healthier snacks, we examine the effect of manipulating the assortment structure and <b>shelf</b> <b>layout</b> of an impulse display including both healthy and unhealthy snacks near the checkout counter of a canteen. Methods Both a lab and field study applied a two-factor experimental design manipulating snack offerings both in an on-screen choice environment and a natural environment (hospital staff restaurant). Shelf arrangement (i. e. accessibility) was altered by putting healthy snacks at higher shelves versus lower shelves. Assortment structure (i. e. availability) was altered by offering an assortment that either included 25 % or 75 % healthy snacks. Participants in the lab study (n[*]=[*] 158) made a choice from a shelf display. A brief survey following snack selection asked participants to evaluate the assortment and their choice. The field experiment took place in a hospital canteen. Daily sales data were collected for a period of four weeks. On completion of the field study, employees (n[*]=[*] 92) filled out a questionnaire about all four displays and rated their attractiveness, healthiness and perceived freedom of choice. Results The lab study showed a higher probability of healthy snack choice when 75 % of the assortment consisted of healthy snacks compared to conditions with 25 % healthy snack assortments, even though choices were not rated less satisfying or more restrictive. Regarding shelf display location of healthy snacks, no significant differences were observed. There was also no significant shelf arrangement by assortment structure interactive effect. The field study replicated these findings, in that this assortment structure led to higher sales of healthy snacks. Sales of unhealthy and total snacks were not impacted by manipulations (no main or interaction effects). Employees preferred shelf displays including a larger healthy snack assortment located at top shelves. Employees also felt more freedom in choice when healthy snacks were displayed at top shelves compared to lower shelves. Conclusions Overall, results suggest that increasing the prominence of healthy snacks by enlarging their availability, while permitting access to unhealthy snacks, is a promising strategy to promote sales. These results point to the importance of nudging strategies to encourage healthier snack patterns. </p...|$|E
