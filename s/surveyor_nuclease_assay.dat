50|$|The {{annealed}} DNA {{is treated}} with <b>Surveyor</b> <b>nuclease</b> to cleave the heteroduplexes. All types of mismatches are identifiable by <b>Surveyor</b> <b>nuclease,</b> although the mismatch cutting preferences fall into four groups from most to least preferred: CT, AC, and CC are preferred equally over TT, followed by AA and GG, and finally {{followed by the}} least preferred, AG and GT. Sequence context also influences the <b>Surveyor</b> <b>nuclease</b> digestion rate.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} genome editing {{technologies}} {{have emerged in}} recent years, including zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease system. These methods promote genome editing by introduction of a double strand DNA break, followed by repair through the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) pathways. While HDR is expected to introduce a consistent modification to the genome, NHEJ can introduce a heterogeneous mix of mutations (usually small indels), which {{will be difficult to}} identify using Sanger sequencing. Point mutations and indels can be detected by <b>surveyor</b> <b>nuclease</b> <b>assay,</b> making it useful to detect genome editing in a pool of cells without the need for clonal expansion prior to analysis, and it can also provide an estimate of the targeting efficiency achieved. Even after clonal expansion, detection of mutations using Sanger sequence may be difficult as each allele can undergo a different editing event. In this case, the <b>Surveyor</b> <b>nuclease</b> <b>assay</b> will actually use this effect to create the required heteroduplexes for detection by the mismatch endonuclease.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{development}} of adverse effects {{resulting from the}} radiotherapy of cancer limits {{the use of this}} treatment modality. The validation of a test capable of predicting which patients would be most likely to develop adverse responses to radiation treatment, based on the possession of specific genetic variants, would therefore be of value. The purpose of the Genetic Predictors of Adverse Radiotherapy Effects (Gene-PARE) project is to help achieve this goal. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A continuously expanding biorepository has been created consisting of frozen lymphocytes and DNA isolated from patients treated with radiotherapy. In conjunction with this biorepository, a database is maintained with detailed clinical information pertaining to diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. The DNA samples are screened using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and the <b>Surveyor</b> <b>nuclease</b> <b>assay</b> for variants in ATM, TGFB 1, XRCC 1, XRCC 3, SOD 2, and hHR 21. It is anticipated that additional genes that control the biologic response to radiation will be screened in future work. RESULTS: Evidence has been obtained that possession of variants in genes, the products of which play a role in radiation response, is predictive for the {{development of}} adverse effects after radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: It is anticipated that the Gene-PARE project will yield information that will allow radiation oncologists to use genetic data to optimize treatment on an individual basis...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemokine}} (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR 5) {{serves as}} an HIV- 1 co-receptor and is essential for cell infection with CCR 5 -tropic viruses. Loss of functional receptor protects against HIV infection. Here, we report the successful targeting of CCR 5 in GFP-marked human {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) using CRISPR/Cas 9 with single and dual guide RNAs (gRNAs). Following CRISPER/Cas 9 -mediated gene editing using a single gRNA, 12. 5 % of cell colonies demonstrated CCR 5 editing, of which 22. 2 % showed biallelic editing as determined by a <b>Surveyor</b> <b>nuclease</b> <b>assay</b> and direct sequencing. The use of dual gRNAs significantly increased the efficacy of CCR 5 editing to 27 % with a biallelic gene alteration frequency of 41 %. To ensure the homogeneity of gene editing within cells, we used single cell sorting to establish clonal iPSC lines. Single cell-derived iPSC lines with homozygous CCR 5 mutations displayed the typical characteristics of pluripotent stem cells and differentiated efficiently into hematopoietic cells, including macrophages. Although macrophages from both wild-type and CCR 5 -edited iPSCs supported CXCR 4 -tropic virus replication, macrophages from CCR 5 -edited iPSCs were uniquely resistant to CCR 5 -tropic virus challenge. This study demonstrates the feasibility of applying iPSC technology {{for the study of the}} role of CCR 5 in HIV infection in vitro, and generation of HIV-resistant cells for potential therapeutic applications...|$|E
30|$|HEK 293 FTEGFP {{cells were}} {{transfected}} with DNA as described above. Cells were cultured for 3  days post transfection prior to genomic DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was purified using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The genomic region flanking TALEN or gRNA target sites was PCR amplified using DreamTaq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific) and appropriate primers (Additional file 7 : Table  2). <b>SURVEYOR</b> <b>nuclease</b> <b>assay</b> {{was carried out}} using methods described previously (Hsu et al. 2013). Briefly, 400  ng total of the PCR products were subjected to a denature/anneal process to enable heteroduplex formation: 95  °C for 10  min; 95 – 85  °C ramping at − 2  °C/s; 85 – 25  °C at − 0.25  °C/s; and 25  °C hold for 1  min. After reannealing, products were treated with SURVEYOR nuclease and SURVEYOR enhancer S (Transgenomics) following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol, and analyzed on 2  % agarose gels. Gels were imaged with a Gel Doc gel imaging system (Bio-Rad). Quantification was based on relative band intensities (Ran et al. 2013). Similar to our previous study (He et al. 2015), to detect genomic deletions and homologous recombination, genomic DNA was subjected to PCR analysis using DreamTaq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific) and appropriate primers (Additional file 7 : Table  2). PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. For sequencing analysis, PCR products corresponding to genomic deletions or homologous recombination were purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Cloned plasmids were sequenced using M 13 primers.|$|E

40|$|Xenotransplantation using porcine cells, tissues or organs {{may reduce}} the {{widening}} gap between demand and supply of human donor organs. However, this may be hampered {{by the presence of}} porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs), which belong to the γ-retroviruses family and are integrated in the porcine genome and were shown to infect human cells in vitro. Three subtypes of PERVs were identified, PERV-A and PERV-B are human tropic and pose a direct risk and are ubiquitous while PERV-C infect only pig cells and is not present in all pig strains. To date, there are no records of in vivo transmission of PERVs to human or primates following porcine material xenotransplantation. Nevertheless, many of the γ-retroviruses are pathogenic and able to induce tumors and immunodeficiency, which can’t be excluded for PERVs. While breeding animals under SPF conditions may eliminate most of pathogens and exogenous viruses, PERVs are difficult to eradicate from the porcine genome and different strategies must be used to prevent their possible transspecies transmission to human. The present study is a contribution to the evaluation of the risks imposed by xenotransplantation {{as well as to the}} prevention of PERV transmission to human. Although PERV-C is not human-tropic, the high infectious PERV-A/C which results from the recombination between PERV-A and PERV-C raised a major concern for xenotransplantation. For this reason choosing PERV-C-free strains with low PERV expression is relevant. The first part of this work addresses the prevalence and the expression of PERV in Göttingen minipigs, which are used for numerous biomedical investigations and are well characterized. PERV-A, -B and -C were found in all animals tested and their expression was low. Infection of human 293 cells was not observed even after mitogen treatment of the pig peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). RNA interference was used in order to reduce the expression of PERVs in pigs and transgenic pigs expressing PERV-pol-specific shRNA were generated in our group. In the second part of this study the long term effects of PERV specific RNA interference and reduction of PERV expression in these pigs was investigated. Over 3 years, the expression of shRNA was persistent and PERV expression was consistently reduced in the pig PBMCs. We also investigated the expression of PERV and shRNA in different organs of the pigs. Moreover, new triple-shRNA expressing vectors were produced using high efficient siRNAs. The use of these vectors showed a significant improvement in reducing the PERV expression in vitro. The third part focuses on the use of zinc finger nucleases (ZFN) to knockout PERV genes. ZFN specific for the PERV-pol gene were used, and expression of ZFN proteins in porcine kidney cells was demonstrated by different methods. However, the high rate of ZFN expression and the high copy number of PERV proviruses seemed to have cytotoxic effects. ZFN activity couldn’t be detected since a <b>surveyor</b> <b>nuclease</b> <b>assay</b> widely used for detection of ZFN induced gene disruption couldn’t be applied in this case. In the last part vaccine strategies to prevent PERV transmission were investigated. Neutralizing antibodies directed against the recombinant viral envelope proteins gp 70 and p 15 E were produced in hamsters. The neutralization effect of the immunized sera was measured using a qRT-PCR based neutralization assay. To summarize, this work contributed into improving the reduction of PERV expression by RNAi, and addressed for the first time the possibility of the use of ZFNs to knock out a gene with high copy number such as PERV...|$|E

50|$|<b>Surveyor</b> <b>nuclease</b> is a {{reasonably}} sensitive enzyme, producing detectable cleavage products from sequences representing {{only a small}} proportion of DNA in the population. It can detect a ratio of 1:32 heteroduplex to homoduplex for smaller PCR products (~0.6 bp), and 1:16 heteroduplex to homoduplex for longer PCR products (~2.3 kb). This property makes it possible to pool clinical samples in order to increase the heteroduplex formation and hence the sensitivity. This is also useful for detection of minor variants in a heterogeneous population (such as heterogeneous tumor). In the case of genome editing by CRISPR or other methods, this property can enhance detection of rare editing events in a population of cells prior to creation and testing of individual edited clones.|$|R
