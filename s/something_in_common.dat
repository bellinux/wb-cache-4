25|$|The {{history of}} {{mathematics}} {{can be seen}} as an ever-increasing series of abstractions. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals, was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common,</b> namely quantity of their members.|$|E

25|$|The {{essence of}} deep-rooted spirit lore is that {{supposed}} spirits {{of one kind or}} another – spirits of the dead, phantasms of the living, wraiths, or nature entities like fairies move through the physical landscape along special routes. In their ideal, pristine form, at least, such routes are conceived of as being straight, having <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with ley lines. By the same token, convoluted or non-linear features hinder spirit movement i.e. labyrinths and mazes.|$|E

On Easter 1975, another circuit layout, {{measuring}} 1.654 miles, came into use. Oulton Park is unique amongst the new post-World War II circuits in that it is a true road circuit whilst its contemporaries were, with one exception, converted airfields (the exception being the short-lived Blandford). It has <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with Mallory Park in that it can trace its history back a very long way (possibly as far as Roman times) and is mentioned in the Doomsday Book as ‘Aleton’.|$|E
25|$|Habitus is {{somewhat}} reminiscent of preexisting sociological {{concepts such as}} socialization, but habitus also differs from the more classic concepts in several important ways. Firstly, a central aspect of the habitus is its embodiment: Habitus does not only, or even primarily, function {{at the level of}} explicit, discursive consciousness. The internal structures become embodied and work in a deeper, practical and often pre-reflexive way. An illustrative example might be the 'muscle memory' cultivated in many areas of physical education. Consider the way we catch a ball - the complex geometric trajectories are not calculated; it is not an intellectual process. Although it is a skill that requires learning, it is more a physical than a mental process and has to be performed physically to be learned. In this sense, the concept has <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with Anthony Giddens' concept of practical consciousness.|$|E

50|$|The two authors {{respected}} each other's {{work and}} shared <b>something</b> important <b>in</b> <b>common</b> as writers: {{depictions of the}} poor and the underclass, who often had difficult lives affected both by the Industrial Revolution and by abject poverty.

500|$|Pizza, or as David notes [...] "pissaladina or pissaladière" [...] in Provence (the cuisines of Mediterranean France and Italy having <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common),</b> is a {{piece of}} bread dough rolled out thin, with a topping which varies from place to place, but is {{generally}} much simpler than those in the English-speaking world. In Naples this is tomato, anchovies and buffalo mozzarella. In San Remo it is onions cooked in olive oil, with salted sardines. The Provençal variety uses onions, black olives, and anchovies.|$|E
500|$|The book {{provides}} {{what has}} been called an idiosyncratic and a combative take on the history of English cooking. The book is unusual as a history in not citing its sources, serving more as an oral social history from Hartley's own experiences as she travelled England as a journalist for the Daily Sketch, interviewing [...] "the last generation to have had countryside lives sharing <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with the Tudors." [...] The book strikes some readers as principally a history, but it consists mainly of recipes. Some of these such as stargazey pie are old-fashioned, but all are practical recipes that can be cooked.|$|E

[...] Since the series' first appearance, the epithet [...] "Joe 90" [...] has become a popular term of endearment for both children and adults with glasses reminiscent of Joe's (such as snooker player Dennis Taylor). During UK repeats in the 1990s, similarities were drawn between Joe and then-Prime Minister John Major, also known for wearing large spectacles. Jeff Evans, writer of The Penguin TV Companion, criticises the plot element of the glasses, writing, [...] "Joe simply dons a pair of scientific glasses, making him look like the class swot than a secret agent." ...|$|E

500|$|The Historic Royal Palaces curator Lucy Worsley {{presented}} a BBC film, Food in England', The Lost World of Dorothy Hartley, on 6 November 2015. Worsley, writing in The Telegraph, calls Food in England [...] "the definitive {{history of the}} way the English eat." [...] She describes the book as [...] "laden with odd facts and folklore ... a curious mixture of cookery, history, anthropology and even magic, ... with her own strong and lively illustrations." [...] She admits it is not a conventional history, since Hartley breaks [...] "the first rule of the historian: to cite her evidence. She wasn't fond of footnotes." [...] In a year of filming Hartley's places and people she knew, Worsley discovered that [...] "my frustration with her technique as historian was misplaced." [...] Hartley had travelled continually to gather materials for her weekly Daily Sketch column, sometimes sleeping rough [...] "in a hedge." [...] The work is thus effectively, Worsley argues, an oral history, as Hartley interviewed [...] "the last generation to have had countryside lives sharing <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with the Tudors." [...] The emphasis on local, seasonal food chimes well, Worsley suggests, with the modern trend for just those things.|$|E

The two interferometers share <b>somethings</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> but also differs: They shared the same femtosecond laser source; both had 50 m long path length differences between the two arms.

But the information obtained from the two detection methods are the same: The PSD and the path length difference at certain enviroment conditions. Imaging Science & TechnologyApplied Science...|$|R

2500|$|Leon Mirsky has said: [...] "combinatorics is a {{range of}} linked studies which have <b>something</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> and yet diverge widely in their objectives, their methods, {{and the degree of}} {{coherence}} they have attained." [...] One way to define combinatorics is, perhaps, to describe its subdivisions with their problems and techniques. This is the approach that is used below. However, there are also purely historical reasons for including or not including some topics under the combinatorics umbrella. Although primarily concerned with finite systems, some combinatorial questions and techniques can be extended to an infinite (specifically, countable) but discrete setting.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the classic}} {{argument}} from illusion (delusion) you {{are asked to}} compare a case where you succeed in perceiving, say, a cat on a mat, to the case where a trick of light deceives you and form {{the belief that the}} cat is on the mat, when it is not. The proponent of the argument then says that the two states of mind in these contrasting cases share <b>something</b> important <b>in</b> <b>common,</b> and to characterise this we need to introduce an idea like that of [...] "sense data." [...] Acquaintance with such data is the [...] "highest common factor" [...] across the two cases. That seems to force us into a concession that our knowledge of the external world is indirect and mediated via such sense data. McDowell strongly resists this argument: he does not deny that there is <b>something</b> psychologically <b>in</b> <b>common</b> between the subject who really sees the cat and the one that fails to do so. But that psychological commonality has no bearing on the status of the judger's state of mind {{from the point of view}} of assessing whether she is in a position to acquire knowledge. In favourable conditions, experience can be such as to make manifest the presence of objects to observers - that is perceptual knowledge. When we succeed <b>in</b> knowing <b>something</b> by perceiving it, experience does not fall short of the fact known. But this just shows that a successful and a failed perceptual thought have nothing interesting <b>in</b> <b>common</b> from the point of view of appraising them as knowledge.|$|R
