50|$|The <b>Strowger</b> <b>system</b> {{was widely}} used until the {{development}} of the more reliable crossbar switch, an electromechanical switch with a matrix of vertical and horizontal bars and simpler motions.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s the {{decision}} was made to convert to automatic switching and it was completed by 1961, based on 21 exchanges, spread across the country, with one international exchange, based in London. The equipment used the <b>Strowger</b> <b>system</b> for switching, as was the case for the telephone network. Conversion to Stored Programme Control (SPC) began in 1984 using exchanges made by Canadian Marconi with the last Strowger exchange closing in 1992. User numbers increased over the following years into the 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fundamental}} modularity of {{the system}} combined with its step-by-step (hence the alternative name) selection process and an almost unlimited potential for expansion gives the <b>Strowger</b> <b>system</b> its technical advantage. Previous systems had all been designed for a fixed number of subscribers to be switched directly {{to each other in}} a mesh arrangement. This became quadratically more complex as each new customer was added, as each new customer needed a switch to connect to every other customer. In modern terminology, the previous systems were not [...] "scalable".|$|E
50|$|TXE, {{which stands}} for {{telephone}} exchange electronic, was the designation given to a family of telephone exchanges developed by the British General Post Office (GPO), now BT, designed to replace the ageing <b>Strowger</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
50|$|Under <b>Strowger's</b> <b>system</b> {{that was}} first {{introduced}} commercially in La Porte, Indiana the number was dialled using two telegraph keys. The subscriber tapped eight times on one, then three times on the second to 'dial' the number 83. When this was introduced into Albion, New York in 1899 - the keys {{had been replaced by}} a rotary dial.|$|R
25|$|As in the <b>Strowger</b> (SXS) <b>system,</b> each {{central office}} could address up to 10,000 {{numbered}} lines, requiring four digits for each subscriber station.|$|R
5000|$|In England, The Automatic Telephone and Electric Co {{operated}} a manufacturing plant in Liverpool. British Insulated Cables had founded an Automatic Telephone Manufacturing Company in November 1911 to manufacture the <b>Strowger</b> <b>system</b> under licence from the Automatic Electric Company of Chicago. The first maker of automatic exchanges in the UK, this company (as of 1923) {{was one of}} four which manufactured equipment for Post Office-owned central offices. It became part of International Automatic Telephone Co in 1920, which changed name to Automatic Electric Co in 1932 and Automatic Telephone and Electric Co Ltd in 1936 to reflect a product range which included sidelines ranging from Xcel heating appliances to traffic signals.|$|E
50|$|The 220 / 132 / 25 KV {{power supply}} network for {{electrification}} extends along the track over {{a zone of}} about 200/300 km. It is centrally controlled from the division control centre through remote control arrangements to ensure un-interrupted power supply to the track overhead equipment. In the present day electrification projects, a state-of-the-art microprocessor based supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) is being provided as against the earlier electro-mechanical <b>Strowger</b> <b>system</b> of remote control equipment. The SCADA system has facilities for tele-metering of voltage, current, maximum demand and power factor on a real-time basis, enabling control of maximum demand and thereby the charges thereof {{to be paid to}} the State Electricity Boards. In addition, this system provides for automatic trouble-shooting and isolation of faulty sections.|$|E
5000|$|In November 1922 the General Post Office {{decided to}} adopt the <b>Strowger</b> <b>system</b> from the various systems it had tried and it was to include [...] "Directors" [...] in the {{exchange}}s in London. Demonstration models of the [...] "Director" [...] exchange were shown by manufacturer ATM of Liverpool {{as part of the}} Post Office exhibits at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924 and 1925. However, it was not until 1927 that the first [...] "Director" [...] telephone exchange was brought into service in Holborn, London and rolled out progressively across Greater London. A 3 digit code, represented by letters, identified the local exchange. Director schemes were gradually introduced in the other major cities of the UK [...] - [...] Birmingham, Edinburgh (although a relatively small city, it obtained seven-figure dialling for political reasons), Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester.|$|E
5000|$|Until the Transit System was {{introduced}} in 1971, directly dialled call routings could only involve one intermediate GSC due to transmission requirements, all other calls requiring an operator assisted routing. GSC's were initially based on the <b>Strowger</b> step-by-step <b>system</b> as adopted by the British Post Office for the United Kingdom telephone network. Subsequent developments permitted the use of Crossbar switches designated as TXK1 which offered enhancements such as 2nd attempt routing; a facility not available on <b>Strowger</b> <b>systems.</b> Each of the 639 charging areas was associated or coterminous with one of 230 Group Switching Centres which contained register-translators (Also referred to as GRACE - Group Routing And Charging Equipment) required for local subscribers to originate self dialled trunk calls. During the introduction of International Direct Dialling (IDD), initially referred to as International Subscriber Dialling (ISD) within the UK, Group Switching Centres were equipped with international call timers and international register-translators to route calls to the relevant international exchange for onward routing abroad.|$|R
50|$|Systems {{which have}} control {{subsystem}} {{as an integral}} part of the switching network itself were known as direct control switching systems. Systems in which the control subsytem is outside the switching network are known as Common control <b>systems.</b> <b>Strowger</b> exchanges are usually direct control systems, whereas crossbar, electronic exchanges including all stored program control systems are common control systems. Common control is also known as indirect control or register control.|$|R
50|$|The {{area was}} {{adjacent}} to the London telephone area and formed part of the London Telecommunications Region {{set up in the}} 1930s. The Upminster exchange was the last in the London region to convert from manual service in 1970 and the first to use the TXK system. The Stapleford exchange was the last in the region to use the UAX 13 <b>Strowger</b> automatic exchange <b>system.</b> After being decommissioned in 1992 the exchange, including the original building, became a working exhibit at Avoncroft Museum of Historic Buildings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{supervisory}} equipment {{monitored the}} set-up connections and, in addition, controlled {{the application of}} tones (for example, dial tone), and applied ringing, metering, and release conditions. It monitored the lines by scanning the [...] "highways" [...] successively, examining each pulse channel {{for a period of}} one microsecond. In this period the state of the call was registered and, depending on the stage reached by the call and the class of service of the lines concerned, the logical circuits in the equipment decide on the action to be taken, that was, whether ringing should be applied or cut-off or whether the call should be released. Both the register and the supervisory equipment had [...] "persistence timers" [...] which, in effect, substituted the B and C relays and the S and Z pulses of the <b>Strowger</b> <b>system.</b> These timers were also provided on a common basis.|$|E
50|$|The {{switching}} in TXE2s {{was carried}} out by reed relays and a typical TXE2 contained about 100,000 reeds. A 'reed' was actually two over-lapping ferromagnetic blades hermetically sealed within an inert-gas-filled glass capsule. The blades were gold-plated and separated by just a few thousandths of an inch. The reeds were fast in operation (about 1 millisecond), with a life expectancy of more than 10 million operations. The glass capsules were about an inch (25 mm) in length and about an eighth of an inch (3 mm) in diameter. Four reeds were generally present inside each relay coil, two for the speech-path, one for holding the path and one for metering. Switching with these reeds held out the prospect of much greater reliability compared with the <b>Strowger</b> <b>system,</b> where switching {{was carried out}} by base metal wipers moving through banks of metal contacts. The Strowger switches required routines to be carried out on them to clean the banks: they also required oiling and occasional adjustment. Reed relays required none of this. However, in practice, and particularly {{in the early years of}} the system's service, the performance of the reeds proved to be less good than had been expected.|$|E
2500|$|While the Strowger (step-by-step or SxS) switch moves {{synchronously}} {{with the}} dial pulses {{that come from}} the telephone dial, the more sophisticated Panel switch had senders, similar to {{the directors of the}} later Director <b>system</b> <b>Strowger</b> exchanges used in London and other large British cities. The sender first registered and stored the digits that the customer dialed, and then, with the help of other frames, translated the received digits into numbers appropriate for the selectors: District Brush, District Group, Office Brush, Office Group, Incoming Brush, Incoming Group, Final Brush, Final Tens, Final Units.|$|R
2500|$|The {{panel switch}} {{is an example}} of a power drive system, in that it used 1/16 {{horsepower}} motors to drive the selectors vertically to hunt for the desired connection, and back down again when the call was completed. In contrast, <b>Strowger</b> or crossbar <b>systems</b> used individual electromagnets for operation, and in their case the power available from an electromagnet limits the maximum size of the switch element it can move. [...] With Panel having no such restriction, its dimensions were determined solely by the needs of the switch, and the design of the exchange. The driving electric motor can be made as large as is necessary to move the switch elements. Thus, most calls required only about half as many stages as in earlier systems. Motors used on panel frames were capable of operating on alternating (AC) or direct current (DC), however they could only be started with DC. In the event of an AC power failure the motor would switch to its DC windings, and continue running until AC power was restored.|$|R
50|$|The first UK public {{automatic}} exchange {{was brought into}} service at Epsom, Surrey, in May 1912 using the American <b>Strowger</b> ‘step-by-step’ <b>system.</b> It allowed subscribers to dial the local number themselves (instead of asking the operator to connect them manually). A permanent “junction telephone service” was inaugurated between Liverpool and Manchester during 1914. In 1922 the practice of using the first three letters of an exchange name was introduced in London, Manchester and Birmingham in preparation for automatic dialing. By 1924 there were {{over a quarter of}} million lines connected to more than 40 {{automatic exchange}}s. The main problem in large cities was directing a call over a complex series of interlinking circuits. The first fully automatic system in a large urban area was under an advanced form of the Strowger concept (which enabled one exchange to be connected automatically to another). Called the Director telephone system, this was first tried on a large scale in London’s Holborn Tandem exchange in 1927. The concept was envisaged to be effective for many major built-up areas and the first three exchanges outside London to be ‘cut-over’ to the automatic Director system were: Ardwick, Collyhurst and Moss Side in Manchester during 1930. The exchanges covering the city centre and some suburbs with 7 and a half miles were progressively converted to the same system during the next few years. The automation process meant {{that a large number of}} mainly female telephone operators in the Manchester exchanges became redundant - a crisis that was mentioned in Parliament in 1933. But it had revolutionised call-making across the city. For example, subscribers in Collyhurst and Moss Side were then able to dial the letters A (=2), R (=7) and D (=3) followed by the four digit Ardwick subscribers number to connect them directly without talking with an operator. (3 exchanges in Birmingham were next, in 1931, one in Glasgow in 1937, one in Liverpool in 1941, Edinburgh’s automatic system did not start until 1950). By the time the system was superseded in 1966, there were around 50 three-letter exchange name codes in the Manchester Automatic System (list inside a telephone drawer, pictured), more than in any other director area outside the capital.|$|R
