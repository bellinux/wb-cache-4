50|$|It is {{extremely}} difficult to successfully treat BPF, mainly because of the difficulty obtaining a proper diagnosis. Since the disease starts out with {{what seems to be a}} common case of conjunctivitis, H. aegyptius is not susceptible to the antibiotic eye drops that are being used to treat it. This treatment is ineffective because it treats only the local ocular infection, whereas if it progresses to BPF, <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> treatment is required. Although BPF is susceptible to many commonly used antibiotics, including ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, rifampin, and chloramphenicol, by the time it is diagnosed the disease has progressed too much to be effectively treated. However, with the fast rate of progression of BPF it is unlikely that it will be successfully treated. With antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate of BPF is around 70%.|$|E

50|$|These abscesses are {{the most}} {{commonly}} occurring orofacial bacterial infection. They are often {{the result of an}} inflamed or necrotic dental pulp or an infection of pulpless root canals. This pulp death is often due to the invasion of bacteria from advanced caries. The first line of treatment is the removal of the source of inflammation or infection by local operative measures. Generally, the abscess can be eradicated through surgical drainage alone; however this is sometimes inadequate. Therefore, <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> treatment may be required, but only if there is evidence of spreading infection. As the bacteria involved are known, antibiotic therapy selection can be specific, based on published susceptibilities. Penicillin in the form of amoxicillin is the most common antibiotic to use. However, 3% of the patient population is allergic to penicillin, so erythromycin is often used in cases of hypersensitivity.|$|E

Methods: 25 mechanically ventilated patients (out of 150 screened) were enrolled in the current observational single-center study. They were randomized to receive either NT (300 mg, BID; group 1, n= 15) as an adjunct to <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> or for a correction of the regimen of <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> (group 2, n= 10). The primary outcome measure was resolution of NP and acute respiratory insufficiency. The CPIS, signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and oxygenation index were used as objective indicators of the clinical progress. Results: The following signs of NT efficacy were detected in 87 % of group 1 patients: a decrease of SIRS and CPIS scores within (2. 3 ± 1. 2) d of NT therapy (P< 0. 05); decrease of microbes titer to 103 – 104 CFU/mL (P< 0. 05); increase of microbes sensitivity to <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> in 40 % of patients; positive X-ray dynamics in 60 % of patients within (9. 0 ± 2. 5) d of NT therapy.

Rabbits received no additional treatment and served as control (group 1), were treated with <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> (group 2), or treated with <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> and intra-articular corticosteroids (group 3). After 15  days animals were killed and joint histopathological-histochemical parameters were assessed.  RESULTS—All rabbits survived the experiment.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the methodological quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis in severe acute pancreatitis {{in relation to}} outcome. METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for RCTs that studied the effectiveness of <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis in severe acute pancreatitis. A meta-analysis was performed with a random effects model. Methodological quality was quantified by a previously published scoring system (range 0 - 17 points). RESULTS: Six studies, {{with a total of}} 397 participants, obtained a methodological score of at least 5 points and were included. <b>Systemic</b> <b>antibiotic</b> prophylaxis had no significant effect on infection of pancreatic necrosis (absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0. 055; 95 % CI - 0. 084 to 0. 194) and mortality (ARR 0. 058, 95 % CI - 0. 017 to 0. 134). Spearman correlation showed an inverse association between methodological quality and ARR for mortality (correlation coefficient - 0. 841, p = 0. 036).

40|$|Background The risk of {{developing}} a tunnelled central venous catheter (CVC) -related infection ranges between 0. 1 and 2. 3 per 1000 catheter days for children with cancer. These infections are difficult to treat with <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> (salvage rate 24 % - 66 %) due to biofilm formation in the CVC. Lock treatments can achieve 100 - 1000 times higher concentrations locally without exposure to high systemic concentrations. Objectives Our objective {{was to investigate the}} efficacy of antibiotic and other lock treatments in the treatment of CVC-related infections in children with cancer compared to a control intervention. We also assessed adverse events of lock treatments. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, issue 3, 2011), MEDLINE/PubMed (1945 to August 2011) and EMBASE/Ovid (1980 to August 2011). In addition we searched reference lists from relevant articles and the conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) (from 2006 to 2010), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (from 2006 to 2010), the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) (from 2006 to 2011), the American Society of Hematology (ASH) (from 2006 to 2010) and the International Society of Thrombosis and Haematology (ISTH) (from 2006 to 2011). We scanned the ISRCTN Register and the National Institute of Health Register for ongoing trials (www. controlled-trials. com) (August 2011). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing an antibiotic lock or other lock treatment (with or without concomitant <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics)</b> with a control intervention (other lock treatment with or without concomitant <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> or <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> alone) for the treatment of CVC-related infections in children with cancer. For the description of adverse events, cohort studies were also eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and performed 'Risk of bias' assessments of included studies. Analyses were performed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Main results Two RCTs evaluated urokinase lock treatment with concomitant <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> (n = 56) versus <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> alone (n = 48), and one CCT evaluated ethanol lock treatment with concomitant <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> (n = 15) versus <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> alone (n = 13). No RCTs or CCTs evaluating antibiotic lock treatments were identified. All studies had methodological limitations and clinical heterogeneity between studies was present. We found no evidence of significant difference between ethanol or urokinase lock treatments with concomitant <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> and <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> alone regarding the number of participants cured, the number of recurrent CVC-related infections, the number of days until the first negative blood culture, the number of CVCs prematurely removed, ICU admission and sepsis. Not all studies were included in all analyses. No adverse events occurred in the five publications of cohort studies (one cohort was included in two publications) assessing this outcome; CVC malfunctioning occurred in three out of five publications of cohort studies assessing this outcome. Authors' conclusions No significant effect of urokinase or ethanol lock in addition to <b>systemic</b> <b>antibiotics</b> was found. However, this could be due to low power or a too-short follow-up. The cohort studies identified no adverse events; some cohort studies reported CVC malfunctioning. No RCTs or CCTs were published on antibiotic lock treatment alone. More well-designed RCTs are needed to further explore the effect of antibiotic or other lock treatments in the treatment of CVC-related infections in children with cance...|$|R
