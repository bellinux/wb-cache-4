25|$|The Kamnas {{had four}} children, though one {{died in an}} {{accident}} at the farm at age three. One son, Edgar, in time took over the farming on the farm. About 1910 the Kamna family built an addition to the barn, and around 1920 built a second addition to the barn. They continued adding buildings to the farm in the early 1900s including a woodshed, privy, pumphouse, chicken coop, smokehouse, potato shed, and a canning shed. The last addition was a garage in the 1920s. In the 1920s the family added indoor plumbing to the farmhouse, {{and in the process}} enclosed parts of two porches. The Kamnas grew oats, fescue, rye grass, vetch, and sub-clover on the farm and used the barn for <b>sorting</b> <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> the seeds, running the farm into the 1950s. As of 2007 the farm was owned by Wayne Reed and Petrina Pometto. On October 10, 2007, the Manningâ€“Kamna Farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the port}} {{facilities}} {{needed to support}} containerization changed. One effect was the decline of some ports {{and the rise of}} others. At the Port of San Francisco, the former piers used for loading and unloading were no longer required, but there was little room to build the vast holding lots needed for container transport. As a result, the Port of San Francisco virtually ceased to function as a major commercial port, but the neighboring port of Oakland emerged as the second largest on the US West Coast. A similar fate met the relation between the ports of Manhattan and New Jersey. In the United Kingdom, the Port of London and Port of Liverpool declined in importance. Meanwhile, Britain's Port of Felixstowe and Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands emerged as major ports. In general, inland ports on waterways incapable of deep-draft ship traffic also declined from containerization in favor of seaports. With intermodal containers, the job of <b>sorting</b> <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> containers could be performed far from the point of embarking.|$|E

50|$|In agriculture, postharvest {{handling}} is {{the stage}} of crop production immediately following harvest, including cooling, cleaning, <b>sorting</b> <b>and</b> <b>packing.</b> The instant a crop {{is removed from the}} ground, or separated from its parent plant, it begins to deteriorate. Postharvest treatment largely determines final quality, whether a crop is sold for fresh consumption, or used as an ingredient in a processed food product.|$|E

40|$|Abstract â€” This paper {{presents}} an application to sort objects {{based on its}} colour using a robotic arm. In many small scale industries, the major obstacle faced is shortage of time and laborers to efficiently <b>sort</b> <b>and</b> <b>pack</b> the products. This hurdle can be overcome by using the developed robotic arm which is cost effective and user friendly. This method of packaging is faster and does not require continuous monitoring, thereby increases the production and growth of the industry. In this paper, computer vision is carried out {{with the aid of}} OpenCV and the robotic arm is powered by Arduino microcontroller. The eBox- 3300 MX is used as the hardware to integrate OpenCV with robotic arm. Index Terms â€” Arduino, dominant colour detection algorithm, eBox- 3300 MX, OpenCV. I...|$|R

50|$|In 1825 (or 1827), the Tariff Manufacturing Company built {{a carpet}} mill along the Farmington River, giving {{its name to}} the area. The company name came from the Tariff Act of 1824 which {{included}} protective tariffs for a number of products, including wool and cotton textiles. The area did not have sufficient housing for the workers, so the company built housing, some of which survives today. The carpet business survived for a few decades, but by 1867, the primary industry in the area was <b>sorting</b> <b>and</b> <b>packing</b> of tobacco.

Micrometeorological data were monitored every 15 minutes for 20 days during winter 2014 and summer 2015. The parameters evaluated were air temperature (oC), relative humidity (%) and radiant thermal load, RTL,(W/m 2). External environmental data were obtained from weather stations close to the packing houses. The data obtained show that packing houses minimum and maximum temperatures were reached at 6 am and 3 pm, respectively, during winter and summer. Both seasons had air temperatures above 20 Â°C, relative humidity below 90 % and radiant thermal load above 450 W/m 2. The construction materials that had the highest energy transmissions were the roofs. Metal roofs had the worst thermal conditioning, resulting in maximum internal air temperatures of 32. 7 Â°C and minimum relative humidity of 40. 9 % at 3 pm, during summer.

Such an apology for a dinner had not been seen during the last four months of wild travel--unpleasant when guests have been bidden to a feast! The night at the Docks, also, was a trifle mortuary, over-silent and tranquil: all hands, officers and men, who could not get leave to sleep ashore, simply took leave--I believe myself to have been for a time both captain and crew of the SinnÃ¡r.
