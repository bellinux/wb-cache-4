25|$|The oracle bones do {{not contain}} king lists, but they do record the sacrifices to {{previous}} kings and the ancestors of the current king, which follow a standard schedule that scholars have reconstructed.

25|$|Climate engineering, {{commonly}} referred to as geoengineering, also known as climate intervention, There is <b>substantial</b> <b>agreement</b> among scientists that climate engineering cannot substitute for climate change mitigation. Some approaches might be used as accompanying measures to sharp cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Given that all types of measures for addressing climate change have economic, political, or physical limitations, some climate engineering approaches might eventually be used as part of an ensemble of measures. Research on costs, benefits, and various types of risks of most climate engineering approaches is at an early stage and their understanding needs to improve to judge their adequacy and feasibility.|$|E

50|$|The link to India however is {{not only}} {{consistent}} with Plotinus' passion for India, but also helps to explain the often noted <b>substantial</b> <b>agreements</b> and shared ideas between Vedanta and Neoplatonism which are increasingly attributed to direct Indian influence.|$|R
30|$|Fair inter-rater <b>agreement,</b> <b>substantial</b> intra-rater <b>agreement</b> and a {{moderate}} to <b>substantial</b> rater-device <b>agreement</b> for the TIR test were found. No significant correlations {{were found between}} the TIR test and the pivot shift test and anterior drawer test with foot in internal rotation. This strengthens the idea that the TIR test assesses a different aspect of ALRI than the aforementioned tests do. The TIR test only demonstrates increased tibial internal rotatory laxity and can therefore be of additional value to the dynamic pivot shift test.|$|R
25|$|Beukema and Saint Lawrence Seaway proponents were {{convinced}} that such a nautical link would lead to development of the communities and economies of the Great Lakes region by enabling ocean-going ships. In this period, grain exports to Europe were highly important to the national economy, along with other commodities. The negotiations on the treaty resumed in 1938 and by January 1940, <b>substantial</b> <b>agreement</b> was reached between Canada and the United States. By 1941, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Mackenzie King made an executive agreement to build the joint hydro and navigation works, but this failed to receive the assent of the U.S. Congress. Proposals for the seaway were met with resistance; primary opposition came from interests representing existing harbors on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and internal waterways, and from the railroads associations. The railroads carried freight and goods between the coastal ports and the Great Lakes cities.|$|E

2500|$|Discussion over {{currency}} war and imbalances dominated the G20 summit. Attending {{leaders such as}} Britain's David Cameron made statements suggesting good progress had been made. Yet according to most commentators no <b>substantial</b> <b>agreement</b> was reached, with the US largely unable to persuade other nations to endorse the measures it considers necessary to rebalance the global economy. [...] IMF managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said this particular summit was [...] "more of a G20 debate than a G20 conclusion".|$|E
2500|$|Over {{a period}} of decades, Bartlett has weighed the {{question}} whether psychotherapy is truly effective. In 1987, his book When You Don’t Know Where to Turn: A Self-Diagnosing Guide to Counseling and Therapy was published and subsequently adopted by the Psychology Today Book Club and the Psychotherapy Book Club. The book presents a self-diagnosing algorithm to help readers identify, based on effectiveness studies, potentially most promising forms of therapeutic care. The algorithm takes into account individual symptoms, circumstances, personality, and life goals. The book {{was followed by the}} publication of the author's summary appraisal of the effectiveness of psychotherapy, about which psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, a long-time critic of psychiatry, commented: [...] "It is one of the best, if not the best, that I have read on this subject." [...] Similarly, psychologist Hans H. Strupp, who has extensively studied the effectiveness of psychotherapy, commented: [...] "I find myself in <b>substantial</b> <b>agreement</b> with [...] major points which are well stated." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{the model}} of an offer {{mirroring}} acceptance makes sense to analyse almost all agreements, it does not fit in some cases. In The Satanita the rules of a yacht race stipulated that the yachtsmen would be liable, beyond limits set in statute, {{to pay for all}} damage to other boats. The Court of Appeal held that there was a contract to pay arising from the rules of the competition between The Satanita's owner and the owner of Valkyrie II, which he sank, even though there was no clear offer mirrored by a clear acceptance between the parties at any point. Along with a number of other critics, in a series of cases Lord Denning MR proposed that English law ought to abandon its rigid attachment to offer and acceptance in favour of a broader rule, that the parties need to be in <b>substantial</b> <b>agreement</b> on the material points in the contract. In Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corp Ltd this would have meant that during a [...] "battle of forms" [...] two parties were construed as having material agreement on the buyer's standard terms, and excluding a price variation clause, although the other court members reached the same view on ordinary analysis. In Gibson v Manchester CC he would have come to a different result to the House of Lords, by allowing Mr Gibson to buy his house from the council, even though the council's letter stated it [...] "should not be regarded as a firm offer". This approach would potentially give greater discretion to a court to do what appears appropriate at the time, without being tied to what the parties may have subjectively intended, particularly where those intentions obviously conflicted.|$|E
40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s the European Union has {{introduced}} a number of policy coordination processes that abstain from delegating or pooling sovereignty. Instead the EU relies on soft law that does not legally bind governments {{in the same way}} as the Community Method used to. The literature assumes that soft law is chosen to achieve common objectives given considerable diversity among the Member States. In contrast, this paper suggests that non-binding coordination is first and foremost a means to foster compromises in the absence of <b>substantial</b> <b>agreements.</b> Three case studies demonstrate that international organisations have repeatedly relied on soft law to overcome disagreements among their members. The IMF, the OECD, and the EU introduced soft coordination at times of institutional crisis to prevent a breakdown of negotiations...|$|R

60|$|But it was {{not alone}} what he had himself seen and heard and felt. The reading {{to which he had}} set himself had opened a new world of science for him. He was amazed at the {{enormous}} amount of direct evidence gathered and presented by careful men. Chemists applying the methods of the retort, biologists working in their own laboratories, psychologists and medical experts experimenting as upon a clinical subject, presented the same or similar facts. In Austria, in Russia, in England, the results were identical. To his mind, accustomed to sift and relate evidence, the most convincing thing of all was the <b>substantial</b> <b>agreement</b> of each and all of these investigators. In a certain sense the sneer of the faithful was deserved. These men of X-ray penetration and electrical annunciators had succeeded only in paralleling the phenomena of {{the early days of the}} healer and the magician.|$|E

40|$|The {{irregular}} polygonal {{pattern of}} solar granulation is analyzed for size-shape relations using statistical crystallography. In contrast to previous work which has assumed perfectly hexagonal patterns for granulation, more realistic accounting of cell (granule) shapes reveals a broader basis for quantitative analysis. Several features emerge as noteworthy: (1) a linear correlation between number of cell-sides and neighboring shapes (called Aboav-Weaire's law); (2) a linear correlation between both average cell area and perimeter {{and the number}} of cell-sides (called Lewis's law and a perimeter law, respectively) and (3) a linear correlation between cell area and squared perimeter (called convolution index). This statistical picture of granulation is consistent with a finding of no correlation in cell shapes beyond nearest neighbors. A comparative calculation between existing model predictions taken from luminosity data and the present analysis shows <b>substantial</b> <b>agreements</b> for cell-size distributions. A model for understanding grain lifetimes is proposed which links convective times to cell shape using crystallographic results...|$|R
30|$|To {{show the}} {{reproducibility}} {{of the relationship}} features between tophi and tendon, the data were analysed and indicated a <b>substantial</b> inter-observer <b>agreement</b> between the radiologists, with a kappa index result of 0.627 (P[*]<[*] 0.001) and McNemar-Bowker test (chi-squared equal to 30.0 with P[*]<[*] 0.001). To our knowledge, there are no studies in the literature that describe this agreement in patients with proven tophaceous gout.|$|R

30|$|Column CK from Table  3 {{exhibits}} {{the level}} of agreement of each dataset in our evaluation by means of Cohen’s Kappa, an extensively used metric to calculate inter-anotator agreement. After a close look {{in the cases of}} disagreement with the evaluations in the Gold standard, we realized that other interpretations could be possible for the given text, finding cases of sentences with mixed polarity. Some of them are strongly linked to original context and are very hard to evaluate. Some NYT comments, for instance, are directly related to the news they were inserted to. We can also note that some of the datasets do not contain neutral messages. This might be a characteristic of the data or even a result of how annotators were instructed to label their pieces of text. Most of the cases of disagreement involve neutral messages. Thus, we considered these cases, as well as the amount of disagreement we had with the gold standard data, reasonable and expected, specially when taking into account that Landis and Koch [70] suggest that Kappa values between 0.4 and 0.6 indicate moderate agreement and values amid 0.60 and 0.8 correspond to <b>substantial</b> <b>agreements.</b>|$|R
30|$|Frequently {{clinical}} evaluation alone cannot fully explain the {{problems caused by}} tophi.

40|$|Avidity {{tests can}} be used to {{discriminate}} between cattle that are acutely and chronically infected with the intracellular parasite Neospora caninum. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the IgG avidity ELISA tests being used in four European laboratories. A coded panel of 200 bovine sera from well documented naturally and experimentally N. caninum infected animals were analysed at the participating laboratories by their respective assay systems and laboratory protocols. Comparing the numeric test results, the concordance correlation coefficients were between 0. 479 and 0. 776. The laboratories categorize the avidity results into the classes "low" and "high" which are considered indicative of recent and chronic infection, respectively. Three laboratories also use an "intermediate" class. When the categorized data were analysed by Kappa statistics there was moderate to <b>substantial</b> <b>agreements</b> between the laboratories. There was an overall better agreement for dichotomized results than when an intermediate class was also used. Taken together, this first ring test for N. caninum IgG avidity assays showed a moderate agreement between the assays used by the different laboratories to estimate the IgG avidity. Our experience suggests that avidity tests are sometimes less robust than conventional ELISAs. Therefore, it is essential that they are carefully standardised and their performance continuously evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the feasibility of virtual models as an alternative to orthodontic plaster models. Virtual dental models (obtained from OrthoCAD®) and corresponding plaster models of 80 patients in the permanent dentition were randomly selected from patients seeking orthodontic care. Inter-examiner error was assessed by measuring tooth width, overjet, overbite, intermolar width, intercanine width, and midline discrepancy. Criterion validity of virtual model analysis was determined by the agreement between the measurements from virtual and plaster models. Test-retest reliability was determined by remeasuring 10 virtual models 1 week later. Comparison analysis was assessed by calculating the mean directional differences and standardized directional differences. Correlation analysis was determined by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Both intra- and inter-examiner reliability and test-retest reliability of virtual model analysis were acceptable in measuring intercanine, intermolar, overjet, overbite, midline discrepancy, space analysis, and tooth width (ICC > 0. 7). Good criterion validity was indicated by agreement between the results from the plaster and virtual models (ICC > 0. 8). There were <b>substantial</b> <b>agreements</b> for canine and molar relationship classifications (κ > 0. 70). The results suggest that analysis performed on virtual models is as valid as traditional plaster models for intra- and inter-arch relationship. © The Author 2010. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
