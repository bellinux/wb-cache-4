Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming, the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.|$|E
25|$|The SO {{molecule}} has a triplet {{ground state}} similar to O2, i.e. each molecule has two unpaired electrons. The S−O bond length of 148.1pm {{is similar to}} that found in lower <b>sulfur</b> <b>oxides</b> (e.g. S8O, S−O = 148pm) but is longer than the S−O bond in gaseous S2O (146pm), SO2 (143.1pm) and SO3 (142pm).|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} a {{sufficiently}} large asteroid or comet could have caused food chains to collapse both on land and at sea by producing dust and particulate aerosols and thus inhibiting photosynthesis. Impacts on sulfur-rich rocks could have emitted <b>sulfur</b> <b>oxides</b> precipitating as poisonous acid rain, contributing further {{to the collapse of}} food chains. Such impacts could also have caused megatsunamis and/or global forest fires.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sulfur</b> <b>oxide</b> (SOx) - A {{general term}} for <b>oxides</b> of <b>sulfur,</b> which are emitted from motor {{vehicles}} burning fuel containing sulfur. Reducing {{the level of}} fuel sulfur reduces the level of <b>Sulfur</b> <b>oxide</b> emitted from the tailpipe.|$|R
25|$|The {{first major}} {{environmental}} concern was air pollution, with Halden experiencing the highest <b>sulfur</b> <b>oxide</b> content of any Norwegian town. The sulfite pulp used limestone, {{which made it}} impossible to capture the <b>sulfur</b> <b>oxide.</b> This was mitigated in 1978, when the pulp mill was rebuilt to instead use magnesium.|$|R

The development of cartridges and explosive primers were a major improvement in the use of gunpowders in the field.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sulfur</b> <b>oxides</b> (SOx) - {{particularly}} sulfur dioxide, {{a chemical}} compound with the formula SO2. SO2 {{is produced by}} volcanoes and in various industrial processes. Coal and petroleum often contain sulfur compounds, and their combustion generates sulfur dioxide. Further oxidation of SO2, usually {{in the presence of}} a catalyst such as NO2, forms H2SO4, and thus acid rain. This is one of the causes for concern over the environmental impact of the use of these fuels as power sources.|$|E
25|$|As FAME {{contains}} {{low levels}} of sulfur, the emissions of <b>sulfur</b> <b>oxides</b> and sulfates, major components of acid rain, are low. Use of biodiesel also results in reductions of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter. CO emissions using biodiesel are substantially reduced, {{on the order of}} 50% compared to most petrodiesel fuels. The exhaust emissions of particulate matter from biodiesel {{have been found to be}} 30% lower than overall particulate matter emissions from petrodiesel. The exhaust emissions of total hydrocarbons (a contributing factor in the localized formation of smog and ozone) are up to 93% lower for biodiesel than diesel fuel.|$|E

25|$|The well-to-wheel variant has a {{significant}} input on a model developed by the Argonne National Laboratory. The Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model was developed to evaluate the impacts of new fuels and vehicle technologies. The model evaluates the impacts of fuel use using a well-to-wheel evaluation while a traditional cradle-to-grave approach is {{used to determine the}} impacts from the vehicle itself. The model reports energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and six additional pollutants: volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), particulate matter with size smaller than 10 micrometre (PM10), particulate matter with size smaller than 2.5 micrometre (PM2.5), and <b>sulfur</b> <b>oxides</b> (SOx).|$|E
25|$|Natural gas is {{a fossil}} fuel {{composed}} mainly of methane, {{which can be}} burned to release heat that is then used to produce electricity. It contains very little sulphur, no ash and almost no metals; therefore, unlike with coal, heavy metal and SOx (sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide) pollution {{is not a major}} concern. In the United States the average natural gas-fired plant emits 516kg of carbon dioxide, 0.05kg of sulfur dioxide and 0.8kg of nitrogen oxides (NOx) per megawatt-hour of energy generated. Compared with coal, natural gas generates about half as much carbon dioxide, one-third of the nitrogen oxides, and one one-hundredth of the <b>sulfur</b> <b>oxides.</b>|$|E
25|$|By-products {{of thermal}} power plant {{operation}} {{must be considered in}} their design and operation. Waste heat energy, which remains due to the finite efficiency of the Carnot, Rankine, or Diesel power cycle, is released directly to the atmosphere or river/lake water, or indirectly to the atmosphere using a cooling tower with river or lake water used as a cooling medium. The flue gas from combustion of the fossil fuels is discharged to the air. This gas contains carbon dioxide and water vapor, as well as other substances such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), <b>sulfur</b> <b>oxides</b> (SOx), mercury, traces of other metals, and, for coal-fired plants, fly ash. Solid waste ash from coal-fired boilers must also be removed. Some coal ash can be recycled for building materials.|$|E

500|$|Chlorine monofluoride (ClF) is {{extremely}} thermally stable, and is sold commercially in 500-gram steel lecture bottles. It is a colourless gas that melts at −155.6°C and boils at −100.1°C. It may {{be produced by}} the direction of its elements at 225°C, though it must then be separated and purified from chlorine trifluoride and its reactants. Its properties are mostly intermediate between those of chlorine and fluorine. It will react with many metals and nonmetals from room temperature and above, fluorinating them and liberating chlorine. It will also act as a chlorofluorinating agent, adding chlorine and fluorine across a multiple bond or by oxidation: for example, it will attack carbon monoxide to form carbonyl chlorofluoride, COFCl. It will react analogously with hexafluoroacetone, (CF3)2CO, with a potassium fluoride catalyst to produce heptafluoroisopropyl hypochlorite, (CF3)2CFOCl; with nitriles RCN to produce RCF2NCl2; and with the <b>sulfur</b> <b>oxides</b> SO2 and SO3 to produce ClOSO2F and ClSO2F respectively.
