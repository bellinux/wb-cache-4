The whole history of science <b>shows</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> whenever the educated and scientific men of any age have denied the facts of other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility, the deniers have always been wrong.|$|E

25|$|Stevens (1982) {{suggests}} that ethology and analytical psychology are both disciplines trying to comprehend universal phenomena. Ethology <b>shows</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> each species {{is equipped with}} unique behavioural capacities that are adapted to its environment and 'even allowing for our greater adaptive flexibility, we are no exception. Archetypes are the neuropsychic centres responsible for co-ordinating the behavioural and psychic repertoire of our species'. Following Bowlby, Stevens points out that genetically programmed behaviour {{is taking place in}} the psychological relationship between mother and newborn. The baby's helplessness, its immense repertoire of sign stimuli and approach behaviour, triggers a maternal response. And the smell, sound and shape of mother triggers, for instance, a feeding response.|$|E

Her Campuss Kelly Tierney noted the enthusiasm displayed by Oliver's fans during the segment and wrote: While John Oliver simply considers himself a comedian, it is apparent that he is doing much more than comedy. [...] He informs us of real issues we otherwise wouldn't hear or think deeply about, which in and of itself is brilliant, but what really sets him apart is his way of calling his audience to action about these issues. He <b>shows</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> there really is something we can do and helps us to see how we can enact change.|$|E
500|$|The song earned {{mixed reviews}} from critics. A staff of Tourdates.co.uk gave a {{favorable}} review commending Ribbons' vocal display. The reviewer added [...] " [...] often we are bombarded with wannabes [...] with weak vocals and insipid songs, [...] <b>shows</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> {{there is life}} after pop idol and with 'a little bit' of cred." [...] Music Week also gave a positive review, noting the song was [...] "catchy". However, Ian Hyland, writing for the Sunday Mirror was critical of the song, giving it a grade of 6 out of 10. He remarked that Ribbons [...] "fails" [...] at doing [...] "sexy R'n'B". Similarly, Julie MacCaskill of the Daily Record dismissed it as [...] "a lacklustre affair with the wannabe star ditching her Mariah sound- a-like singing in favour of becoming a Kylie clone". The single debuted at number nineteen on the UK Singles Chart, the week dated January 25, 2003. The position became its peak position. The following week, the song dropped to number thirty-seven and the week after exited the top forty.|$|E

[...] In their 2008 book, Global Bollywood: Travels of Hindi Song and Dance, Sangita Gopal and Sujata Moorti wrote: [...] "Chandralekha is a film that translates the aesthetic of Hollywood Orientalism for an indigenous mass audience" [...] and called its drum-dance scene [...] "perhaps {{one of the most}} spectacular sequences in Indian cinema." [...] In his 2009 book, 50 Indian Film Classics, M. K. Raghavendra wrote: [...] "Indian films are rarely constructed {{in a way that makes}} undistracted viewing essential to their enjoyment and Chandralekha is arranged as a series of distractions ... Chandralekha apparently <b>shows</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> enjoyment and visual pleasure in the Indian context are not synonymous with edge-of-the-seat excitement but must permit absent-mindedness as a viewing condition." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although many 16th and 17th Century theorists {{agreed with}} Aristotle's views {{concerning}} {{the place of}} women in society, none of them tried to prove political obligation {{on the basis of}} the patriarchal family until sometime after 1680. The patriarchal political theory is closely associated with Sir Robert Filmer. Sometime before 1653, Filmer completed a work entitled Patriarcha. [...] However, it was not published until after his death. [...] In it, he defended the divine right of kings as having title inherited from Adam, the first man of the human species, according to Judeo-Christian tradition. However, in the latter half of the 18th century, clerical sentiments of patriarchy were meeting challenges from intellectual authorities – Diderot's Encyclopedia denies inheritance of paternal authority stating, [...] "...reason <b>shows</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> mothers have rights and authority equal to those of fathers; for the obligations imposed on children originate equally from the mother and the father, as both are equally responsible for bringing them into the world. Thus the positive laws of God that relate to the obedience of children join the father and the mother without any differentiation; both possess a kind of ascendancy and jurisdiction over their children..." ...|$|E

In addition, Elsie often suffered from ill health, including anaemia, among other ailments, and had several operations during her years onstage. The gossip column in The Pelican called her [...] "the occasional actress". Bullough wanted his wife to retire from the stage. The publicity shy and exhausted Elsie was happy to leave the stage for the next several years, except for charity performances to benefit the war effort. She returned in the title role of Louis Parker's comedy play Malvourneen with Herbert Beerbohm Tree at His Majesty's Theatre, as Lady Catherine Lazenby in The Admirable Crichton in 1916 and in the title role in Pamela written by Arthur Wimperis, with songs by Frederic Norton (1917; with Owen Nares). [...] The Tatler wrote of her performance in Malvourneen, [...] "Everyone should see Miss Lily Elsie in this play, for it <b>shows</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> her comedy is as good as her musical comedy, which is saying a great deal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout Lorde's career she {{included}} {{the idea of}} a collective identity in many of her poems and books. Audre Lorde did not just identify with one category but she wanted to celebrate all parts of herself equally. She was known to describe herself as African-American, black, dyke, feminist, poet, mother, etc. In her novel [...] Lorde focuses on how her many different identities shape her life and the different experiences she has because of them. She <b>shows</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> personal identity is found within the connections between seemingly different parts of life. Personal identity is often associated with the visual aspect of a person, but as Lies Xhonneux theorizes when identity is singled down to just to what you see, some people, even within minority groups, can become invisible. In her late book The Cancer Journals she said [...] "If I didn't define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people's fantasies for me and eaten alive." [...] This is important because an identity is more than just what people see or think of a person, it is something that must be defined by the individual. [...] "The House of Difference" [...] is a phrase that has stuck with Lorde's identity theories. Her idea was that everyone is different from each other and it is the collective differences that make us who we are, instead of one little thing. Focusing on all of the aspects of identity brings people together more than choosing one piece of an identity.|$|E
