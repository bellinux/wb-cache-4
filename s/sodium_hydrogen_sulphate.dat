The noteworthy {{features of the}} present system are shorter reaction times, and mild and solvent-free conditions. Furthermore, it offers chemoselective protection of aldehydes. Results Both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes reacts smoothly with acetic anhydride in presence of silica supported <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> to afford the corresponding 1, 1 -diacetates in good to excellent yields. We studied competitive reactions for the acylation of aldehydes {{in the presence of}} ketones using silica supported <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> as a catalyst. Using this catalytic system, the highly selective conversion of an aldehyde in the presence of ketone was observed. Conclusions NaHSO 4 -SiO 2 is a chemoselective and highly efficient catalyst for acylal formation from aldehydes. The advantages of this methodology over the reported methods is the availability of the starting materials, simplicity of acylation procedure, a clean work-up, a short reaction time, high yields and reusability. </p...|$|E

40|$|In this research, polyalkyd resins were {{prepared}} from palm oil by using polycondensation reaction. A two-step method viz., alcoholysis and esterification {{was conducted to}} synthesize polyalkyd resins. Prior to alcoholysis, crude palm oil was subjected for dehydration process to increase its unsaturation. Different types of catalysts such as, sulphuric acid, para-toluene sulfonic acid, phosphoric acid, <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> and potassium hydrogen sulphate {{were used for the}} dehydration. In alcoholysis process, the triglyceride-based dehydrated oil was reacted with glycerol to produce monoglyceride. The prepared monoglyceride was further brought into contact with acid anhydride to prepare polyalkyds. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the reaction parameters for esterification like reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst concentration, acid anhydride to mono-glyceride ratio and agitation speed. The optimum condition was used to prepare various types of polyalkyds by using different types of acid anhydrides such as, maleic anhydride, succinic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, 3, 4, 5, 6 -tetrahydrophthalic anhydride and cis- 1, 2 -cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride. A comparison was drawn among the resins prepared by using different types and percentages of acid anhydrides. The produced bioresins were characterized for physico-chemical properties such as, viscosity, density, iodine value, acid value, drying time, non-volatile materials content, specific gravity, colour, etc. The resins prepared with optimum reaction parameters were subjected for curing process by using methyl ethyl ketone peroxide and cobalt naphthanate. To enhance the resinous property, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were dispersed into the resin at different percentages of loading such as, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 wt. %. The loading was optimized based on the tensile strength of the film. Finally, in-situ polymerization with carbon nanotubes during esterification was performed by adding optimum percentage of loading. The films produced from different formulations were characterized by different testing such as, adhesion, chemical resistivity, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction analysis, contact-angle measurement, tensile testing, pencil hardness, gloss, etc. In addition, the curing kinetics of the resin was analysed to evaluate the kinetic parameters such as, reaction rate, activation energy and degree of conversion in terms of time and temperature. Result analyses through RSM revealed a desirability of 0. 985 for the reaction time of 88. 64 min. Moreover, 91. 5 % fractional conversion was achieved actually, which is close to the predicted value. Analysis revealed that 3, 4, 5, 6 -tetrahydophthalic anhydride-based resin showed improved resinous property than others due to high degree of crosslinking. It was also found that higher amount of aliphatic acid anhydrides are responsible for high degree of crosslinking density, whereas higher thermal stability was ensured by the inclusion of aromatic acid anhydride. Finally, incorporation of MWCNTs into the alkyd resin enhanced the overall film properties, which was further improved through in-situ reaction. The physical bonding and mechanical entanglement were the possible reason for showing improved properties, as revealed from the analysis...|$|E

In this paper, it was found that: the phytoextraction efficiency of alfalfa plants was enhanced after the <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate/citric acid mixtures were added into soil.

40|$|Background: The hygienic-microbiological {{control of}} 6 dental units being in {{use for the}} past 16 years {{revealed}} a significantly increased microbial contamination of their cooling water system. In order {{to comply with the}} requirements of the drinking water directive (“Trinkwasserverordnung”), the commercially available production system ActiDes, producing on-site ActiDes-Blue which is based on hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and generated by anodic oxidation, was investigated. Method: Water samples from the 6 contaminated dental units were examined for the total number of colony forming units (cfu), contamination with molds, L. pneumophila and P. aeruginosa. The control period for the total colony count was 4 weeks (8 samples/unit). The subsequent application phase of the ActiDes-Blue procedure was 6 months (31 samples/unit). Additionally, the redox potential and the pH value were measured. Futhermore, the decontamination agent CARELA HYDRO-DES, a two component agent based on H 2 O 2 {{with the addition of a}} mixture of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> and sulphuric acid in an aqueous solution effective at 0. 1 % and higher, was applied in a unit that had been put out of service for a month before. Before application, the system was first filled with a 5 % solution of the alkaline pre-cleaning agent CARELA Solvent for bacterial slime; the system was left with this solution for 1 h. The pre-cleaning agent was then completely displaced from the system with tap water and a decontaminating solution of 5 % CARELA HYDRO-DES and left in place for 1 h. Results: Drinking water quality level was reached only twice during the control phase. The average values of the dental units ranged between 3, 633 CFU/ml and 29, 417 c/ml. During the application phase, drinking water level could be achieved in 11 water samples. In another 6 water samples a total colony count of 1, 000 cfu/ 100 ml for molds. 1 h after the decontamination, no bacteria and molds could be detected in 1, 000 ml of tap water. Despite the fact that the unit was not used any longer, after 7 d the bacterial colony count was 3 cfu/ml at 22 °C and 2 cfu/ml at 36 °C while molds could not be detected. Even after a rest time of 14 d only 167 cfu/ml or 42 cfu/ml could be yielded. Molds were further not cultivable. A material damage could not be observed. Discussion: Pertaining to the ActiDes technology’s effectiveness, it has to be pointed out that the dental units investigated were those used for dental students' teaching and therefore were clearly less frequently used than clinically used units in a dental practice. This resulted in distinctly longer stagnation periods which favored formation of biofilms. Conclusions: In summary, the ActiDes technology and ActiDes-Blue showed not to be sufficiently effective for the sanitation of contaminated water reservoirs in dental units under aggravated conditions of repeated and longer periods of non-use in connection with longer water stagnation periods. In comparison, the biofilm was sustainably eliminated through the combined application of CARELA® Solvent for Bacterial Slime with subsequent decontamination using CARELA® HYDRO-DES...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, anti-congestion drugs Ambroxol and Bromhexine, and anti-cough drugs Clobutinol, Butamyrate and Pentoxyverine were studied and {{determined}} {{with the use}} of HPLC-reverse-phase. Initially, the chromatographic behaviour of each was determined in relation to certain parameters which change chromatographic conditions and influence duration of analysis, separation capability of determinated systems and measurement sensitivity. Specifically, the effect of polarity on the retention time of the solvent was studied. For mobile phase preparation, selected solvents were methanol and acetonitrile which were prepared in aqueous solution of various concentrations. It was observed that increased concentrations of mobile phase in organic solvents with little polarity resulted in increased solubility of the said mobile phase and, consequently a reduction in the required time for analysis of the analytes. Improvement in time required for analysis of these drugs and symmetry of chromatographic peaks was accomplished after exploring effects various salts (added in aqueous form) had on each mobile phase. Especially trialed were various types of regulating aqueous solutions of base salts CH 3 COONH 4, CH 3 COONa, CH 3 COOK and CH 3 COOMg, from which CH 3 COONH 4 was selected as being most suitable for the cases of anti-congestion drugs Ambroxol and Bromhexine. The latter improved chromatographic peak symmetry and quite perceptively reduced the retention time of the analytes in question. For anti-cough Clobutinol, Butamyrate and Pentoxyverine, mobile liquid phases were studied which contained CH 3 COONH 4, tetraethylammonium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate</b> or tetrabutylammonium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphate.</b> It became evident that retention time co-efficients of anti-cough pharmaceuticals are influenced to a great degree by the concentration and the type of salt.
