30|$|In {{their paper}} “Interference {{coordination}} of heterogeneous LTE systems using remote radio heads”, J. Kim, D. Lee, and W. Sung consider {{the problem of}} co-channel interference (CCI) mitigation in LTE-advanced heterogeneous networks (HetNets). In contrast to a homogeneous cell structure, {{which is based on}} a single type of <b>serving</b> <b>nodes</b> - the macro base stations (BSs), HetNets employ multiple types of <b>serving</b> <b>nodes</b> for coverage extension. In this paper, focus is on HetNets composed of macro BSs and remote radio heads (RRHs) - smaller <b>serving</b> <b>nodes</b> which are geographically distributed and connected to the macro BSs via fast and reliable backhaul links. The authors first discuss two available CCI mitigation techniques for LTE-advanced HetNets and then propose a novel CCI mitigation scheme which uses temporary muting of RRHs. System-level simulations illustrate the advantages of the proposed scheme in terms of achieved signal-to-noise-and-interference ratios and user throughput. Deployment options with regard to geographical placement of RRHs are also investigated.|$|R

This is preposterous on account of conventional base stations (BS) for which site procurement is costly. Long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A) defines the idea of heterogeneous networks (HetNets), where BSs with different coverage and capacity are utilized to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the clients. To maximize the transmission quality of the clients in the coverage holes, LTE-A also defines multihop relay (MHR) networks, where the relay stations (RSs) are also placed along with the BSs. Unfortunately, the placement approaches for HetNet and MHR <b>serving</b> <b>nodes</b> are not standardized. In this work, two different approaches like site selection with maximum service coverage (SSMSC) and site selection with minimum placement cost (SSMPC) are proposed, which identifies the required number of <b>serving</b> <b>nodes,</b> their types, and the placement locations to maximize the coverage and to maintain the placement cost (PC) within the limits of the total placement budget. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approaches are computationally less complex and offer enhanced performance in terms of aggregate PC, coverage, and power proportion compared to the other conventional approaches...|$|R

However, when the new <b>serving</b> <b>node</b> a (t) is different from the current <b>serving</b> <b>node</b> i (i.e., a (t) ≠ i), the handover will happen, and the cost in this case is set to be Ki,a(t). Note that Ki,a(t) denotes the switching cost from the current <b>serving</b> <b>node</b> i to the new <b>serving</b> <b>node</b> a (t). The value of Ki,a(t) depends on several factors, such as the types of handover and the current traffic load on the <b>serving</b> <b>node.</b>|$|E

30|$|In this article, {{we focus}} this study on a {{handover}} policy in wireless relay systems. At first, a relay transmission {{system with a}} single cell is introduced. In order to obtain better system performance, the adaptive modulation and coding schemes are employed. Furthermore, the available transmission rates for both the direct transmission and relay transmission links have been analyzed. Due to the mobility of MSs, a handover decision problem is then considered, which is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). After that, a profit function is {{used to evaluate the}} QoS of the chosen <b>serving</b> <b>node,</b> which represents the benefit that the MS can gain by choosing a <b>serving</b> <b>node</b> (i.e., the BS or some RS). The cost function is also considered, which captures the processing and signal load incurred when the connection switch the current <b>serving</b> <b>node</b> to another. Based on the profit and cost functions, the reward function is formulated. The objective of the handover problem is to maximize the expected total reward per connection. An optimal MDP-based handover decision policy is proposed by employing the value iteration algorithm (VIA). Furthermore, the proposed MDP-based handover policy is generalized to multi-cell relay systems.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the performance, it is desired to compare our proposed MDP-based handover policy with other policies through computer simulations. Unfortunately, {{to the best of}} the authors’ knowledge, few previous studies take the QoS and processing load together as the handover criteria in wireless relay systems. Here, a nearest distance handover policy and a biggest channel gain handover policy are taken as the comparative policies. In the nearest distance handover policy, each MS chooses the nearest <b>serving</b> <b>node</b> at each decision epoch. In the biggest channel gain handover policy, the <b>serving</b> <b>node</b> to be selected in each decision epoch is the one that has the biggest channel gain. Then, under the same simulation environments, the numerical results of the proposed MDP-based handover policy are compared with the nearest distance handover policy and the biggest channel gain handover policy.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a vehicular network {{in which the}} wireless nodes are located on a system of roads. We model the roadways, which are predominantly straight and randomly oriented, by a Poisson line process (PLP) and the locations of nodes on each road as a homogeneous 1 D Poisson point process (PPP). Assuming that each node transmits independently, the locations of transmitting and receiving nodes are given by two Cox processes driven by the same PLP. For this setup, we derive the coverage probability of a typical receiver, which is an arbitrarily chosen receiving node, assuming independent Nakagami-$m$ fading over all wireless channels. Assuming that the typical receiver connects to its closest transmitting node in the network, we first derive {{the distribution of the}} distance between the typical receiver and the <b>serving</b> <b>node</b> to characterize the desired signal power. We then characterize coverage probability for this setup, which involves two key technical challenges. First, we need to handle several cases as the <b>serving</b> <b>node</b> can possibly be located on any line in the network and the corresponding interference experienced at the typical receiver is different in each case. Second, conditioning on the <b>serving</b> <b>node</b> imposes constraints on the spatial configuration of lines, which require careful analysis of the conditional distribution of the lines. We address these challenges in order to accurately characterize the interference experienced at the typical receiver. We then derive an exact expression for coverage probability in terms of the derivative of Laplace transform of interference power distribution. We analyze the trends in coverage probability {{as a function of the}} network parameters: line density and node density. We also study the asymptotic behavior of this model and compare the coverage performance with that of a homogeneous 2 D PPP model with the same node density...|$|E
40|$|Modeling the {{locations}} of nodes as a uniform binomial point process (BPP), we present a generic mathematical framework to characterize the performance of an arbitrarily-located reference receiver in a finite wireless network. Different {{from most of the}} prior works where the serving transmitter (TX) node is located at the fixed distance from the reference receiver, we consider two general TX-selection policies: i) uniform TX-selection: the <b>serving</b> <b>node</b> is chosen uniformly at random amongst transmitting nodes, and ii) k-closest TX-selection: the <b>serving</b> <b>node</b> is the k-th closest node out of transmitting nodes to the reference receiver. The key intermediate step in our analysis is the derivation of a new set of distance distributions that lead not only to the tractable analysis of coverage probability but also enable the analyses of wide range of classical and currently trending problems in wireless networks. Using this new set of distance distributions, we first investigate the diversity loss due to SIR correlation in a finite network. We then obtain the optimal number of links that can be simultaneously activated to maximize network spectral efficiency. Finally, we evaluate optimal caching probability to maximize the total hit probability in cache-enabled finite networks. Comment: A preliminary version of Section IV.
