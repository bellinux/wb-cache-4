40|$|Patterning with {{scanning}} probe methods (SPM) is described {{frequently in the}} literature. Only the feasibility of these techniques has been demonstrated, whereas minor {{attention has been paid}} to technological requirements, such as patterning of thick conductive lines on insulating substrates. The aim of this project was the generation of resist structures with 50 nm critical dimension, which work as etchmasks for metal as well as insulating layers. This ensures the combination of conventional and SPM lithography in a mix and match technique. The exposure is performed either with low energy electrons or with photons. To achieve the required resist thickness of 300 nm a two layer resist system is necessary. Is consists of a thin ( 5 have been achieved. Optical exposure of a 70 nm thick resist results in a <b>spacewidth</b> of 80 nm. However, the writingspeed of 25 #mu#m/s so low that only R and R applications and prototyping appears reasonable. Single elements like field effect transistors with very short gates should be manufactured to demonstrate the applicability of the method. (orig.)
