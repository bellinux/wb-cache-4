This raises concern over the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction. A more localized effect on gender skewing comes from the construction of tall buildings, which reduce <b>sun</b> <b>exposure,</b> lowering the average sand temperature, which results in a shift in gender ratios to favor the emergence of male turtles.|$|E

25|$|Most vegan diets contain {{little or}} no vitamin D without {{fortified}} food. People with little <b>sun</b> <b>exposure</b> may need supplements. The extent to which <b>sun</b> <b>exposure</b> is sufficient depends on the season, time of day, cloud and smog cover, skin melanin content, and whether sunscreen is worn. According to the National Institutes of Health, most people can obtain and store sufficient vitamin D from sunlight in the spring, summer and fall, even in the far north. They report that some researchers recommend 5–30 minutes of <b>sun</b> <b>exposure</b> without sunscreen between 10 am and 3 pm, {{at least twice a}} week.

25|$|Possible {{significant}} {{elements in}} determining risk include {{the intensity and}} duration of <b>sun</b> <b>exposure,</b> {{the age at which}} <b>sun</b> <b>exposure</b> occurs, and the degree of skin pigmentation. Melanoma rates tend to be highest in countries settled by migrants from northern Europe that have a large amount of direct, intense sunlight that the skin of the settlers is not adapted to, most notably Australia.

40|$|A large European {{case-control study}} {{investigated}} the association between sunbed use and cutaneous melanoma in an adult population aged between 18 and 49 years. Between 1999 and 2001 <b>sun</b> and <b>sunbed</b> <b>exposure</b> was recorded in 597 newly diagnosed melanoma cases and 622 controls in Belgium, France, The Netherlands, Sweden and the UK. Fifty three percent of cases and 57 % of controls ever used sunbeds. The overall adjusted odds ratio (OR) associated with ever sunbed use was 0. 90 (95 % CI: 0. 71 - 1. 14). There was a South-to-North gradient with high prevalence of <b>sunbed</b> <b>exposure</b> in Northern Europe and lower prevalence in the South (prevalence of use in France 20 %, OR: 1. 19 (0. 68 - 2. 07) compared to Sweden, prevalence 83 %, relative risk 0. 62 (0. 26 - 1. 46)). Dose and lag-time between first exposure to sunbeds and time of study were not associated with melanoma risk, neither were sunbathing and sunburns (adjusted OR for mean number of weeks spent in sunny climates > 14 years: 1. 12 (0. 88 - 1. 43); adjusted OR for any sunburn > 14 years: 1. 16 (0. 9 - 1. 45)). Host factors such as numbers of naevi and skin type were the strongest risk indicators for melanoma.

25|$|The {{geography}} of the wine growing area in Alsace is determined by two main factors, the Vosges mountains {{in the west and}} the Rhine river in the east. The vineyards are concentrated in a narrow strip, running in a roughly north–south direction, on the lower eastern slopes of the Vosges, at altitudes of 175–420 m. Those altitudes provide a good balance between temperature, drainage and <b>sun</b> <b>exposure</b> under Alsace's growing conditions. Because of predominantly westerly winds, the Vosges mountains tend to shelter Alsace from rain and maritime influence, and the region is therefore rather dry and sunny. Rainfall in Colmar is 500mm, but can vary greatly between sites, and is the driest city in France. While the slope down the Vosges is generally east-facing, many of the best sites are south-west to south-east facing, and benefit from extra <b>sun</b> <b>exposure.</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction: For {{a decade}} or so, {{artificial}} sources of restricted light wavelengths, particularly sunbeds, have progressively gained popularity among adolescents and young adults. Warnings were raised focusing on the risk of accelerated photoaging and photocarcinogenesis. The ULEV (ultraviolet light-enhanced visualization) method is a convenient noninvasive way identifying subtle pigmentary changes presenting as a mottled subclinical melanoderma (MSM). Of note, rare spotty amelanotic macules presenting as skin ivory spots (SIS) was reported on {{any part of the}} body. Subjects and method: This work is the first attempt at evaluating the changes in the MSM and SIS spots developed on the skin of 33 phototype III young women designated as avid users involved in frequent exposures to sunshine and sunbeds for lifestyle purposes for a duration of at least 120 months. Results: MSM was markedly heterogeneous and was distinctly obvious in the majority of adepts of frequent natural and artificial photoexposures. SIS was particularly developed in subjects presenting with severe MSM patterns. Discussion: MSM and SIS are more severe in subjects frequently exposed to sunbeds and <b>sun</b> <b>exposures.</b> These signs possibly represent a risk marker for field photocarcinogenesis...|$|R
