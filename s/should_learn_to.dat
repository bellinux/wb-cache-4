25|$|Social constructivist {{scholars}} view {{learning as}} an active process where learners <b>should</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> discover principles, concepts and facts for themselves, hence the importance of encouraging guesswork and intuitive thinking in learners (Brown et al.1989; Ackerman 1996). In fact, for the social constructivist, reality {{is not something that}} we can discover because it does not pre-exist prior to our social invention of it. Kukla (2000) argues that reality is constructed by our own activities and that people, together as members of a society, invent the properties of the world.|$|E

Beyond this offer to the president, Oakley believed that women <b>should</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> use a gun for the empowering image that it gave. Laura Browder discusses how Oakley's stardom gave hope to women and youth in Her Best Shot: Women and Guns In America. Oakley pressed for women to be independent and educated. She was a key influence {{in the creation of}} the image of the American cowgirl. Through this image, she provided substantial evidence that women are as capable as men when offered the opportunity to prove themselves.|$|E

In February 2013, in an interview with Marca, Jesé spoke out against his lack of senior game, stating that he was confident he was doing well enough to be granted an opportunity and, while he tried {{to learn as much as}} he could from Mourinho, he was a manager who surrounded himself with players who had already made their name. Club chairman Florentino Pérez and B-side coach Alberto Toril both defended Jesé for his comments, although the latter advised that he <b>should</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> control his emotions.|$|E
500|$|According to Crowley's later statements, on 8 April {{he heard}} a disembodied voice that claimed {{to be that of}} Aiwass, the {{messenger}} of Horus, or Hoor-Paar-Kraat. Crowley said that he wrote down everything the voice told him {{over the course of the}} next three days, and titled it Liber L vel Legis or The Book of the Law. The book proclaimed that humanity was entering a new Aeon, and that Crowley would serve as its prophet. It stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this Aeon, [...] "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," [...] and that people <b>should</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> live in tune with their Will. This book, and the philosophy that it espoused, became the cornerstone of Crowley's religion, Thelema. Crowley said that at the time he had been unsure what to do with The Book of the Law. Often resenting it, he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform, which included taking the Stele of Revealing from the museum, fortifying his own island, and translating the book into all the world's languages. According to his account, he instead sent typescripts of the work to several occultists he knew, putting the manuscript away and ignoring it.|$|E
500|$|Rommel was not {{a member}} of the Nazi Party. However, Rommel, as did other Wehrmacht officers, welcomed Hitler's seizure of power. During his time in Goslar, he clashed with those Sturmabteilung (SA) men who {{attacked}} the Jews and others who supported them. Rommel thus showed sympathy towards Hitler's elimination of the SA, believing the worst was now over, although he opined that in the future the Führer <b>should</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> see his own true strength and refrain from such illegal processes. Remy dated Rommel's support for Hitler as 1935, noting a speech in which Rommel praised Hitler for restoring German's self-respect and establishment of the way towards an honourable and righteous peace, as well as efforts in alleviating the disadvantaged people's problems. Numerous historians,, such as Ralf Georg Reuth, David T. Zabecki, Bruce Allen Watson and Peter Caddick-Adams, state that Rommel was one of Hitler's favorite generals and that his close relationship with the dictator benefited both his inter-war and war-time career. Historian Robert Citino describes Rommel as [...] "not apolitical" [...] and writes that he owed his career to Hitler, to whom his attitude was [...] "worshipful", while the historian Charles Messenger describes Rommel's [...] "growing admiration" [...] towards Hitler following the invasion of Poland. Speaking at The National WWII Museum's 2012 International Conference on World War II, the author Nigel Hamilton referred to Rommel as [...] "quite a Nazi". This sympathy did not extend to the Party though. In this regard, he was similar to many other Wehrmacht soldiers, who, with encouragement from Hitler, erroneously believed the army to be the most important element of the regime. Rommel showed particular resentment towards the SA and later, the SS, for their brutality and absorption of resources and personnel.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the day of}} his execution, 30 January 1649, Charles {{dressed in}} two shirts so that he would not shiver from the cold, in case it was said that he was {{shivering}} from fear. His execution was delayed by several hours so that the House of Commons could pass an emergency bill to make it an offence to proclaim a new King, and to declare the representatives of the people, the House of Commons, as the source of all just power. Charles was then escorted through the Banqueting House in the Palace of Whitehall to a scaffold where he would be beheaded. He forgave those who had passed sentence on him and gave instructions to his enemies that they <b>should</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> [...] "know their duty to God, the King - that is, my successors - and the people". He then gave a brief speech outlining his unchanged views {{of the relationship between the}} monarchy and the monarch's subjects, ending with the words [...] "I am the martyr of the people".

2500|$|A {{controversy}} {{emerged on}} May 5, 2008, when Noel Sheppard posted {{a clip of}} King at a Library of Congress reading event on the website NewsBusters. [...] King, talking to high-school students, had said: [...] "If you can read, you can walk into a job later on. [...] If you don't, then you've got the Army, Iraq, I don't know, something like that." [...] The comment was described by the blog as [...] "another {{in a long line}} of liberal media members bashing the military," [...] and likened to John Kerry's similar remark from 2006. [...] King responded later that day, saying, [...] "That a right-wing-blog would impugn my patriotism because I said children <b>should</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> read, and could get better jobs by doing so, is beneath contempt...I live in a national guard town, and I support our troops, but I don't support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise." [...] King again defended his comment in an interview with the Bangor Daily News on May 8, saying, [...] "I'm not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school, so they have more options. [...] Those that don't agree with what I'm saying, I'm not going to change their minds." [...] King later expressed regret for the remark, saying that he misspoke. He characterized the comment as originating from a [...] "brain cramp", and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in, saying that during the Vietnam War, serving in the military was a great career for some, and for others, a sacrifice of two years of one's life. King added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism.|$|E
