5|$|In 1902, two Port Orford cedar {{trees were}} {{planted on the}} east side of City Hall. One tree was planted on the north side and the second tree on the south side of the {{building}} to reinforce the symmetrical aspects of the building. The south tree was replaced in 1999 due to poor health. In 1910, the city added passenger elevators to the open <b>stairwells.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{damage caused}} to the North Tower {{destroyed}} any {{means of escape}} at the impact zone or above it. All <b>stairwells</b> and elevators from the 92ndfloor up were rendered impassable, trapping 1,344people. According to the Commission Report, hundreds were killed instantly by the impact; the rest were trapped and died from the subsequent fire and smoke, the eventual collapse, or (in some cases) after jumping or falling from the building. Elevator shafts channeled burning jet fuel through the building. At least one elevator shaft carried burning fuel downward, exploding on the 77thfloor, the 22ndfloor, and at street level on the West Side Lobby.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} {{hour of the}} fire it spread onto the 23rd and 24th floors. Heavy smoke was {{building}} up in the <b>stairwells</b> and a captain and two firefighters from Engine 11 were assigned {{to go to the}} top level to ventilate the stairwell. The three firefighters went up a center staircase from the 22nd floor and soon radioed that they were disoriented by heavy smoke on the 30th floor. There were attempts to direct the firefighters through the radio, and soon after the captain requested permission to break a window for ventilation, which was followed by a message that the captain was down. Permission to break the window was given and a search and rescue effort was initiated.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "walk-up" [...] {{basement}} is any basement {{that has}} an exterior entrance via a <b>stairwell.</b> Some designs cover the <b>stairwell</b> with angled [...] "basement doors" [...] or [...] "bulkhead doors" [...] to keep rain water from accumulating in the <b>stairwell.</b>|$|R
50|$|Inside, {{the fire}} reached the building's only <b>stairwell</b> and climbed {{as high as}} the 15th floor. It did not reach any higher {{because of a lack of}} flammables in the <b>stairwell,</b> however it filled the <b>stairwell</b> with smoke and heat, making it impassable. Fire crews {{attempted}} to gain access to the building using this <b>stairwell,</b> but could not go any higher than the 11th floor.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{extensive}} restoration of 1986-1991, {{the building was}} fondly remembered for its large, open, and decorative central <b>stairwell.</b> However, this <b>stairwell</b> effectively formed a chimney which violated any number of building codes to which the renovated building would have to conform. To preserve the <b>stairwell's</b> appearance and function while still conforming to modern safety standards, an innovative automated fire protection system was installed which would slide out and close protective fire doors from concealed storage areas on each floor, effectively sealing the <b>stairwell</b> off.|$|R
5|$|Encompassing , the Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building stood {{three stories}} tall. The second and first floors (the latter of which lies {{partially}} below ground) contained laboratory space while {{the third floor}} consisted of communal and teaching spaces like classrooms and offices. Other offices {{on the first floor}} were lit via skylights. The <b>stairwells</b> in Mudd were designed with the purpose of discouraging students from passing through lab spaces to get {{from one side of the}} building to the other. In spite of this, Michael J. Crosbie reported in Architecture in 1986 that students had taken to passing through the building as a shortcut instead of going around it. Furnishings and carpeting in the building were deep blue and rust-colored.|$|E
5|$|Major Kean {{returned}} to {{the ground floor of}} the Chancery and ordered his men to withdraw into a large semicircle at the main entrance to the Chancery. Most of the Marines were inside the Chancery when the crowds outside the Embassy broke through the gates into the compound. The Marines closed and bolted the Chancery door, the elevators were locked by Seabees on the sixth floor and the Marines withdrew up the <b>stairwells</b> locking grill gates behind them. On the ground floor a water tanker was driven through the Chancery door and the crowd began to surge up through the building toward the rooftop. The Marines on the rooftop had sealed the doors and were using Mace to discourage the crowd from trying to break through. Sporadic gunfire from around the Embassy passed over the rooftop.|$|E
5|$|The three story rectory {{took three}} years to complete. On the first floor, there is a dining room, a breakfast room, a kitchen, a pantry, space for archives, a laundry room, and a three car garage. There are four {{separate}} stairways that lead {{up to the second}} floor. The second floor has three offices, a community room, a large library, and a spacious veranda. In the hallway, there is a large stained glass window made in Germany, but repurposed from the Mellon Mansion. The third floor can be reached from either of two <b>stairwells.</b> The floor has ten rooms divided into four apartments and two guestrooms. This floor also has an open veranda.|$|E
50|$|In the {{so-called}} mechanically ventilated smokeproof enclosures, the <b>stairwell</b> is positively pressurized {{relative to the}} rest of the building. This ensures that even when access doors are opened, smoke will not enter the <b>stairwell.</b> Of course, a higher pressure within a <b>stairwell</b> makes it harder to open doors from the building interior to the enclosed vestibules and to the enclosed <b>stairwell.</b> The Life Safety Code requires that the pressure differential across the barrier not be so great as to prevent the door from opening with a force of 30 lbf (133 N) at the door knob or handle. These 'pressurization' problems are, of course, non-existent with naturally ventilated smokeproof enclosures.|$|R
50|$|In {{building}} {{safety and}} construction, a smokeproof enclosure {{is a type}} of exit <b>stairwell</b> that has been designed to keep out smoke (and other combustion products) {{in the event of a}} fire, so that building occupants may more safely exit the building. Rather than entering the <b>stairwell</b> directly from the building interior, one enters a smokeproof enclosure by means of an open-air balcony or alternatively, a so-called open vestibule, and proceeds thence, to the <b>stairwell</b> itself. The way that the balcony or vestibule is ventilated divides smokeproof enclosures into two basic types: mechanically ventilated which is not actually a smokeproof enclosures, where the vestibule and <b>stairwell</b> are ventilated by mechanical equipment, and naturally ventilated open air smokeproof enclosures where the open balcony or vestibule the <b>stairwell</b> has openings directly to the outside of the building. This is the only type of the original concept of a smokeproof tower (i.e.: smokeproof enclosure).|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the vestibule is simple dominated by the main <b>stairwell.</b> This <b>stairwell</b> contains two large murals depicted the history of Mexico from the pre-Hispanic period to just past the Revolution. Both were painted by Carlos Montuy in 1986 [...]|$|R
5|$|As {{the fire}} was going into its sixth hour it had spread up to the 26th floor. With {{inadequate}} water pressure coming from the standpipes, firefighters stretched hoses up the building's <b>stairwells</b> to help fight the fire. While hoses were being taken up to the fire a sprinkler technician arrived to fix the water pressure. This improved the hose streams, but the fire had engulfed several floors {{and could not be}} contained with just hoses. By 7:00 AM, almost eleven hours into the fire, firefighters were able to get control of the fire on the 22nd through 24th floors, but {{the fire was}} still out of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards. Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square.|$|E
25|$|Via Rail's ticket, baggage, and {{information}} counters {{are in this}} space, mostly lined against the north wall. (Via Rail ticket agents also handle all ticketing sales and baggage services for Amtrak.) Small restaurants and other stores line the opposite wall. The main clock and the main departures board are in {{the centre of the}} space. <b>Stairwells</b> {{at either end of the}} hall lead to the arrivals area one floor below and connect to urban transit. Benches are near the <b>stairwells</b> for passengers and those meeting them, although most prefer to wait in the departure area, down the large ramp in the centre of the south wall.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, the Special Commissioner of Investigation for the NYC School District wrote {{a report}} condemning Brooklyn Technical High School administrators {{for failing to}} report several armed robberies {{that took place in}} the {{bathrooms}} and <b>stairwells.</b>|$|E
5000|$|While the Colegio Chico has {{undergone}} significant modifications {{since it was}} built onto the main college in the 18th century, it remains intact to this day. From the Colegio Chico entrance there is a simple <b>stairwell.</b> Siqueiros painted the sides of this <b>stairwell</b> from 1922 to 1924, but he never finished the work. Furthermore, {{much of the work}} was lost during later renovations. Only a work on the <b>stairwell's</b> ceiling, called [...] "The Elements," [...] survives intact.|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate the smoke movement in a full-scale six-storey <b>stairwell</b> induced by a fire in an adjacent compartment. The smoke flow pattern in the <b>stairwell</b> was observed with vertical temperature and velocity field distribution measured. Corresponding Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were carried out by Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and compared with the measured data. It was observed that the smoke flow moved upward in circular patterns and formed vortices under the <b>stairwell</b> tread of each storey. The smoke temperature was found to generally decrease exponentially with height in the <b>stairwell,</b> except the top and the bottom levels, where the temperature is relatively higher. The upward smoke flow velocity first increased and then decreased with height. The predicted smoke flow temperature and velocity by FDS were shown to agree well with the measured values. Temperature distribution is identified {{to be a key}} factor affecting the smoke movement in the <b>stairwell.</b> Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|Only 14 people {{escaped from}} the impact zone of the South Tower (floors 77 to 85) after it was struck by United Airlines Flight 175, and only four people from the floors above it. Individuals {{escaped from the}} South Tower as high up as the 84th floor using <b>stairwell</b> A in the {{northwest}} corner, the only <b>stairwell</b> left intact after the impact. No one survived in or above the impact area in the North Tower. Investigators believe that <b>stairwell</b> A remained passable until the South Tower collapsed at 9:59 am. Because of communication difficulties between 911 operators and FDNY and NYPD responders, {{most of them were}} unaware that <b>stairwell</b> A was passable and instructed survivors above the impact zone to wait for assistance by rescue personnel.|$|R
25|$|The bomb {{instantly}} {{cut off the}} World Trade Center's main {{electrical power}} line, knocking out the emergency lighting system. The bomb caused smoke {{to rise to the}} 93rd floor of both towers, including through the <b>stairwells</b> which were not pressurized, and smoke went up the damaged elevators in the World Trade Center Towers 1 & 2. With thick smoke filling the <b>stairwells,</b> evacuation was difficult for building occupants and led to many smoke inhalation injuries. Hundreds were trapped in elevators in the towers when the power was cut, including a group of 17 kindergartners, on their way down from the South Tower observation deck, who were trapped between the 35th and 36th floors for five hours.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{economic}} hardship, the president commissioned French architect Chomette {{to design a}} presidential palace. At a cost of US$3 million, the building dominated Cotonou's promenade on its completion in 1963. The new palace contained a golden and marble porch, mosaic <b>stairwells,</b> pebble dash walls, and a two-story flag outdoors.|$|E
25|$|The {{new school}} was {{designed}} with interaction and collaboration in mind. Every level will have open spaces with flexible furnishings, outlets for technology and white boards that students, faculty, staff and others can use and adapt for meetings or team projects. Even the large open <b>stairwells</b> {{are designed to}} encourage interaction.|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of fire-induced smoke {{movement in the}} <b>stairwell</b> of a high-rise building are conducted using FDS, version 6. 0. 1, with default settings. Twelve scenarios are considered. The required fineness of the grid is determined first by considering the resolution for both the fire source and the vent flow. The grid sensitivity is conducted {{on the basis of}} velocity profile at the bottom opening and the vertical distribution of temperature in the <b>stairwell.</b> Previous findings on the required number of cells for vent flows are confirmed. Subsequently the results, including the vertical distribution of temperature, pressure distribution, and neutral plane height in the <b>stairwell,</b> are compared to experimental data [...] Good agreement is achieved for the vertical temperature inside the <b>stairwell</b> (maximum relative deviation 12. 3 %). The influence of the staircase on the pressure distribution is demonstrated by comparing two cases with and without staircase. The difference between the pressure inside the <b>stairwell</b> and the pressure outside increases with height, according to the stack effect. However, the pressure difference evolution is not monotonic when there are staircases inside the <b>stairwell.</b> The neutral plane height value is obtained by post-processing the simulation results. Its position is too high in the simulations, compared to experimental data and the corresponding analytical expression...|$|R

25|$|Over {{the windows}} of the ground floor are 16 reliefs made in 1699 to 1700, by the French artist René Chauveau. They are made of bronze, and were {{originally}} to be placed in the palace's <b>stairwells.</b> In the 1890s, the reliefs were mounted on the southern facade, where they replaced a row of windows of the same size. The corresponding windows still exist on the northern facade.|$|E
50|$|A P2 {{building}} {{is characterized by}} the arrangement of apartments around a nearly square interior <b>stairwell,</b> often equipped with a glass roof. The buildings have five to eleven stories and there are usually two apartments per floor, although some designs have three apartments per floor, above and below the <b>stairwell</b> access.|$|R
50|$|Standpipes go in {{a direct}} up and down {{direction}} rather than looping around the <b>stairwell,</b> greatly reducing the length and thus the loss of water pressure due to friction loss. Additionally, standpipes are rigid and do not kink, which can occur when a firehose is improperly laid on a <b>stairwell.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{location}} has {{featured in}} various media. In 1985, the former CWS mill nearby {{was used in}} the Terry Gilliam's dystopian film Brazil. The interior featured as the 'Department of Records', a vast clerks pool where the character Sam Lowry worked, and the deserted corridors of the 'Expediting Department'; the grim passageways and <b>stairwells,</b> as well as the exterior, served as 'Shangri La Towers', the Buttle family's tower block.|$|E
25|$|For the 2009-10 season it {{accommodated}} 2000 home supporters plus 450 {{seats for}} away fans. The stand was unusual, {{when viewed from}} aerial shot, in having a slight bend just {{to the right of}} halfway. In its later incarnation, it was also unusual in having its seating area raised above the pitch with a number of <b>stairwells</b> {{at the front of the}} stand leading up to the seats. There were also a number of supporting pillars in the stand which gave many seats a restricted view.|$|E
25|$|After the South Tower collapsed, FDNY commanders issued {{orders for}} firefighters in the North Tower to evacuate. Due to radio {{communications}} problems, firefighters inside the towers {{did not hear}} the evacuation order from their supervisors on the scene, and most were unaware that the other tower had collapsed. 343 firefighters died in the Twin Towers, {{as a result of}} the collapse of the buildings. No one was able to escape the North Tower from the impact zone or above, as all <b>stairwells</b> and elevator shafts on those floors were destroyed or blocked.|$|E
