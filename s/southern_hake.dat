40|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius australis) is an {{ecological}} and economically important demersal fish in Chile and Argentina. Notwithstanding, genetic resource for genetic or ecological studies on this species are scarce. Consequently, here we present transcriptome sequencing results (RNA-Seq) for spleen and liver tissues with the 454 FLX titanium platform. The de novo transcriptome assembly generated 10, 314 unigenes, {{with an average}} length of 510 bp, N 50 of 572 bp and 3, 171 annotated sequences. A specific Gadiform BLAST search, with focus on immune genes, showed 186 (56 %) genes homologous to those of Atlantic cod. A total of 2, 302 microsatellites were detected in 1, 687 unigenes and 741 presented adequate flanking sequences for primer design. In total, these potential molecular markers and transcriptome characterization represent an important resource for genetic and ecological studies on <b>southern</b> <b>hake...</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} predator-prey model for two species of {{commercial}} importance captured by the Spanish fishing fleet in the National Fishing Ground (ICES areas VIIIc and IXa). In this model, the <b>Southern</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius merluccius) represents the predator, and the blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) is the prey. Blue whiting is the hake’s main prey in the study area, and it represents about 40 % of the <b>Southern</b> <b>hake</b> diet. Both the predator and prey population dynamics follow the Lotka-Volterra formulation, and population dynamics are assumed as logistic, with two interaction coefficients: α is the effect of a unit change in the prey on the percent growth rate of the predator and β is the attack rate or searching efficiency of the predator. The populations interact randomly in proportion to population density. Logistic predator-prey equations were applied to the <b>Southern</b> <b>hake</b> and blue whiting stocks, including biomass, intrinsic rates of growth, carrying capacity and capture for both species. The goal is to maximize the present value of profit, forming the current value Hamiltonian for the maximization problem. Capture costs and prices of hake and blue whiting and discount rate were introduced at this point. Landings and SSB (Spawning Stock Biomass) data from both stocks over the period 1988 - 2010 were used for an econometric estimation by means of the Ordinary Least Squares method, to determine the form taken by the predator-prey net growth functions...|$|E

40|$|In this article, we analyze how to {{evaluate}} fishery resource management under â€œecological uncertaintyâ€. In this context, an efficient policy consists of applying a different exploitation rule {{depending on the}} state of the resource and we could say that the stock is always in transition, jumping from one steady state to another. First, we propose a method for calibrating the growth path of the resource such that observed dynamics of resource and captures are matched. Second, we apply the calibration procedure proposed in two different fishing grounds: the European Anchovy (Division VIII) and the <b>Southern</b> Stock of <b>Hake.</b> Our results show that the role played by uncertainty is essential for the conclusions. For European Anchovy fishery (Division VIII) we find, in contrast with Del Valle et al. (2001), that this is not an overexploited fishing ground.

5000|$|Salmon, Dungeness crab, steelhead {{and many}} other fish that are used {{economically}} will be negatively affected by the increase in temperatures. <b>Southern</b> species, including <b>Hake</b> and Mackerel are predators of baby salmon. Scientists say these species have been feeding on salmon migrating out of the Columbia river. [...] These fish need cold and clean water to reproduce successfully. The high and low flows of the rivers will be shifted in the seasons, negatively affecting salmon rearing. Increases in water temperatures could affect the food for fish in rivers, lakes, Puget Sound and coastal ocean regions. Fishing is big business in the Pacific Northwest and many local economies depend on fishing. There is a current debate on how to allocate the run of salmon. The local Native American tribes get a modest percentage of the statewide income from salmon fishing, with the majority going to commercial fishermen. The ones left out are the sport fishermen, those who participate in recreational fishing. The economic problem with this is that sport fishermen spend much more money per fish caught, and since they are less efficient, they drive the economy through the Spending multiplier throughout the local economy. The salmon allocation is hotly contested and when salmon populations are low, local economies suffer {{the majority of the}} impact. During 2007, the commercial fishermen caught 43% and the sport fishermen caught 57% of the total fish. Native Americans' treaties guarantee them a maximum of 50% of the total run before the commercial and sport fishers take their share, under the Boldt Decision of 1974.|$|R

During this period, considerable effort {{has been made to}} improve the precision of age data by means of successive agereading calibration exercises, exchanges, and workshops in 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2004. This goal was partly achieved, and experts recently agreed on standard criteria (Piñeiro and Saínza, 2003) that allowed an acceptable precision to be reached for ages up to 3 years (Piñeiro et al., 2004).

40|$|Population {{genetic data}} of marine genetic {{resources}} {{add up to}} establish their pattern of connectivity. Such pattern determines {{the choice of a}} suitable management strategy to those resources in space and time. This study addresses the pattern of connectivity among European hake grounds upon the largest sampling effort so far developed in this species. Bayesian inference made on multilocus genotypic data provides evidence that a large genetic connectivity exists among Atlantic grounds and is mediated by significant migration rates stepping up from the Celtic Sea towards its adjacent Atlantic grounds. Therefore, the spawning biomass of the northern hake population could play a crucial role at ensuring the sustainability of <b>southern</b> <b>hake</b> fish grounds. The deepest restriction to gene flow was observed at the easternmost side of the Alboran Sea what suggests that the Almeria–Oran Oceanographic Front is an effective barrier keeping apart the two major gene pools so far shown in this species. A molecular clock calibrated for cytochrome b sequences of fishes and applied to the divergence between hake pools (0. 3 %) suggests that the Atlantic–Mediterranean population split might date back to the Middle Pleistocene (150, 000 years BP). Complementarily, Bayesian treatments of multilocus genotypes indicate that such barrier to gene flow remains active nowadays. This study shows the upmost interest of future integrative efforts to incorporate population genetic data into current assessment practices, in order to better manage European hake populations and make its exploitation sustainable...|$|E

These programs consist on onboard-observer sampling schemes, with co-operative vessels, quasirandom selected, in the ICES Division VIIIc and IXa. The methodology used to estimate hake discards for Portugal and Spain since 2003 {{was based on the}} one proposed in the “Workshop on Discard Sampling Methodology and Raising Procedures” (PGCCDBS, Denmark, 2003). Spain presents results for the years 1994, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2003 and 2004. In the Portuguese Program, 2004 is the first year with an analysis of discard data. The number of trips sampled by the Spanish program for 2004 was 53, distributed by three trawl fleets- BACA trawl, Pair trawl and WHVO trawl. Portuguese onboard-observers sampled 40 trips distributed by Crustacean and Fish trawl fleets. The estimated percentages of discarded hake in relation to total catch were of 19, 9 (C. V. = 22. 6 %) and 46, 7 (C. V. = 72. 1 %) for the Spanish and Portuguese fleets respectively. The confidence interval for the Portuguese discard estimate is very large which denotes the very low precision of the obtained value. A co-operation in the analysis of this kind of data, between the two countries, could be the next step, since a standardisation of the methods would be of great importance for a realistic comparison of results obtained from both programs...|$|E
40|$|The European hake {{is one of}} {{the major}} commercially {{important}} species in Western Europe fisheries. Currently its management is divided into different functional units in the Mediterranean (GFCM, General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean) and two stocks in the Atlantic: the Southern and the Northern Stock. The basis for the definition of this management stock structure is under permanent discussion and in the latest years there were an increased amount of genetic studies addressing this topic. Integrated ecosystem assessment requires an improved understanding of the marine ecosystem to provide an effective advice. To this end we have gathered hake genetic information from different studies with the aim of developing a spatial assessment model that links the current stocks. These studies show a restricted gene flow between <b>Southern</b> <b>hake</b> and Mediterranean hake, although a smaller genetic distance between Southern and Northern stocks than one expected from two independent populations, suggesting the presence of a major gene flow from northern grounds core stock (Porcupine and Great Sole Banks) towards the Bay of Biscay and the northwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula. However the quantitative implementation of genetic metrics (such as Fst, migration rates, etc) into population dynamic models is not straightforward given the different nature and assumptions behind these different approaches. In this work we discuss the problems to link these different disciplines suggesting ways to overcome them. These include ways to improve future genetic sampling and developing plausible scenarios for genetic connectivity in population dynamic models...|$|E

Fishing activity is conducted under a rights-based system for <b>southern</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius australis) and hoki (Macroronus magellanicus), where a TAC is allocated in an even manner among fleets and operators. New management approaches not only call for the need of the simultaneous consideration of biological, technologic, economic, social, legal and institutional factors but also, stakeholders perceptions and interests are becoming increasingly relevant for decision making. In spite of the undeniable importance for stakeholder inclusion in fisheries management, {{their perception of the}} system status and expectations are frequently partial and biased by short term needs and interests. Thus, information on expected impacts of alternative management measures are a valuable guiding input to improve stakeholder perception. This paper, therefore explores the value of dynamic simulation model in providing illustrative information on bioeconomic impacts to the fishery system from alternative management measures. The dynamic simulation model is based on two main modules. A biologic module depicting the fish population dynamics, considering recruitment based on Beverton and Holt function. A bioeconomic module depicting fleet dynamics based investment functions by Clark et al. (1979) Munro and Munro (1998) and catch per unit of effort proportional to biomass.

This project includes four case studies, one of which aims at analyzing alternative sampling plans for fisheries operating on Northern & <b>Southern</b> <b>hake</b> stocks. The case study analyzes a variety of sampling design scenarios, from Simple Random Sampling to combinations of stratified sampling designs (by country, by port, by quarter…), using anonymised landings data from logbooks and sales notes (2013 - 2014). The results were compared regarding bias and precision to evaluate the best approach. The most precise estimates of total catch were obtained in scenarios stratified by port and, secondly, by port and country and by port and quarter. The general conclusion was that regional sampling designs stratified by port provided improved precision in this fishery. Apart from statistical considerations, this conclusion was also discussed under other points of view to give a feasibility perspective showing that coverage by country, and also by domain (stock), would be compromised if regional design is simply based on statistical analyses. Efficiency and precision of sampling were found to be highly sensitive to the sampling assumptions and in general countries with smaller contributions to overall landings of hake would see their sampling plans reduced, compromising other requirements for advice such as those related to other stocks or local management measures established by National governments. Hence further analyses are being considered that integrate biometrics, cost-benefit aspects, and concurrent or single-stock sampling strategies...|$|E
40|$|Construction of {{ecosystem}} models requires {{detailed information on}} trophic interactions {{which may not be}} readily available, especially for top predators such as cetaceans. Such information can also be useful to estimate natural mortality (M) for fish stock assessments and to evaluate the potential for competition between cetaceans and fisheries. In the present paper we provide estimates and confidence limits, taking into account sampling error, for consumption of fish by the four most common cetaceans along the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, while highlighting the uncertainties and biases inherent in the information presently available on energy requirements, diet and population size. We estimated that common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) consume around 6800 (95 % CI, 4871 - 9476) tons of sardine (Sardina pilchardus), 8800 (6195 - 12, 647) tons of gadids, 1100 (721 - 1662) tons of hake (Merluccius merluccius) and 1900 (1222 - 2752) tons of scads (Trachurus sp.) annually. For striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), prey consumed were 900 (196 - 2661) tons of sardine, 6200 (3448 - 11, 129) tons of gadids, 200 (11 - 504) tons of hake and 1600 (0 - 5318) tons of scads. Estimated amounts taken by harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are much lower, reflecting their low abundance in the area. Cetacean predation on sardine represents 2 - 8 % of the current M value, indicating that cetaceans probably have little influence on sardine population dynamics. For the <b>southern</b> <b>hake</b> stock, estimated average removal by cetaceans often exceeds M. While this may indicate that both M and the consumption estimates for hake require revision it also suggests that cetaceans could have a more significant impact on hake populations. Different approaches to estimation of energy requirements of cetaceans can result in figures that differ by at least a factor of 2. The lack of good estimates of field metabolic rate for most species probably represents the most serious barrier to reliably quantifying the role of cetaceans in the ecosystem...|$|E

Analytical assessments using age-structured models were conducted for {{the northern and southern}} stocks of megrim, the Bay of Biscay sole and nephrops stocks, whereas the two hake stocks and one southern stock of anglerfish were assessed using models that allow the use of only length-structured data (no age data). A surplus-production model, without age or length structure, was used to assess the second southern stocks of anglerfish. No analytical assessments have been provided for the northern stocks of anglerfish after 2006. This is mostly due to ageing problems and to an increase in dis-cards in recent years, {{for which there is no}} reliable data at the stock level. The state of stocks for which no analytical assessment could be performed was inferred from ex-amination of commercial LPUE or CPUE data and from survey information. Four stocks within the remit of the WG went through the benchmarking process in 2014. For the two southern megrim stocks, the inclusion of discards and some modifi-cations in the assessment model settings were carried out. For northern hake, the ret-rospective pattern issue which arose in last year’s assessment was partly addressed and for <b>southern</b> <b>hake,</b> convergence issues of the assessment model were investigated. Three nephrops stocks from the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian waters are scheduled for benchmark assessments at the start of 2015. The WGBIE meeting spent some time plan-ning this benchmark (see Annex N) together with longer term benchmarks (2016 and after, see section 1.). A recurrent issue significantly constrained the group’s ability to address the terms of reference this year. Despite an ICES datacall with a deadline of 4 weeks before the meeting, data for several stocks were only available at the start of the meeting which lead to increase in workload during the working group, as in that case, the assessments could not be carried out in National Laboratories prior to the meeting as mentioned in the ToRs. This is an important matter of concerns for the group members. Section 1 of the report presents a summary by stock and discusses general issues. Sec-tion 2 provides descriptions of the relevant fishing fleets and surveys used in the as-sessment of the stocks. Sections 3 to 13 contain the single stock assessments. Additionally, the WG ToRs this year included a reconsideration of the reference points for northern hake (see Annex R) ...|$|E
40|$|STECF EWG 13 - 06 {{notes that}} it has {{extensively}} addressed the ToR regarding the requested fishing effort regime evaluations in the 11. Eastern and Western Baltic, 12. the Kattegat, 13. the Skagerrak, North Sea, European waters in ICES Div. 2 and the Eastern Channel, 14. to the West of Scotland, 15. Irish Sea, 16. Celtic Sea, 17. Atlantic waters off the Iberian Peninsula, 18. Western Channel, 19. Western Waters and Deep Sea 20. and the Bay of Biscay, i. e. updated estimates of trends in fishing effort, landings and discards by species, CPUE and LPUE by fisheries and species, and partial fishing mortalities for effort regulated and non-regulated fisheries by Member States. Few ToR could not be accomplished due to time constraints and/or data deficiencies and will be accomplished during the forthcoming STECF EWG 13 - 13 fishing effort regime evaluations part 2 (7 - 11 October 2013, Barza d’Ispra, Italy). Outstanding ToRs are those dealing with the requested comparative analyses regarding cod and sole selectivity of fully documented fisheries (FDF) and fisheries not participating in FDF schemes, detailed evaluations of the national implementation as regards fishing effort derogations granted under the provisions of article 13 of the new cod plan (Counc. Reg. No 1342 / 2008), as well as spatio-temporal patterns in cod catchability. STECF EWG 13 - 06 tasks have been supported by the DCF fishing effort data call in 2013. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes a general improvement in data completeness and quality as well as compliance with dead lines regarding Member States’ data provisions. However, STECF EWG 13 - 06 suffered again from delays, incompleteness and erroneous data submissions and re-submissions. Details about the DCF data call definitions, data quality in 2013 and significant shortfalls as identified by JRC and the experts contributing to the working group are summarized in section 4. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes that its recommendations in 2012 to amend the 2013 DCF data call to support fishing effort regime evaluation have been implemented and that these changes have supported and will support the accomplishment of specific ToR. STECF EWG 13 - 06 noted that the DCF data call in 2013 required re-submissions of re-aggregated data {{in addition to the}} re-quested data update for 2012, which implied additional workload for the national institutions involved in the DCF framework. Notably Denmark, Portugal and UK (without Scotland) have revised their complete time series of fisheries specific catch and effort data. Spanish data were made available for 2012 and discard data were inserted to earlier data submissions to support the effort regime evaluation for <b>Southern</b> <b>hake</b> and Nephrops. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes that ICES (WGMIXFISH 2013) has undertaken a detailed comparison of the 2011 ICES fisheries data received in 2013 and the 2011 STECF DCF effort data received and compiled in 2012. While the fisheries specific data on landings and nominal effort are found highly consistent, the ICES estimates of discards were consistently higher than the estimates of discards provided in the STECF data base. The pronounced differences in discard estimates are mainly due to different raising procedures applied and shall be further analysed in order to identify best and consistent practices applied to discard raising (section 4. 12). STECF EWG 13 - 06, in response to the general increased interest in discard estimates, has proposed an Index of Discard Coverage DQI to facilitate the use of the discard estimates provided in the STECF data bases on fisheries specific catch and fishing effort and obtained through the 2013 DCF data call. The DQI allows identification and avoidance of the use of discard estimates by fisheries based on the proportion of sums of national landings covered by discard estimates in relation to the overall sums of national landings. The method to derive the DQI and the interpretation of the results are provided in section 4. 5 of the present report. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes that all resulting fisheries parameters of various fishing effort regimes are downloadable at the requested aggregation in the format of digital Appendixes to the present report at the working group’s web page: [URL] Major findings regarding the regional fishing effort regime evaluations as derived by STECF EWG 13 - 06 are summarized in the following sections, specifically for each of the reviews undertaken and covering new or additional ToR as appropriate...|$|E
40|$|Single-species {{models have}} been {{commonly}} used to assess fish stocks in the past. Since these models have relatively simple data requirements, they sometimes provide the only tool available to assess {{the status of a}} stock when data are not enough to develop more complex models. However, these {{models have been}} criticized for several reasons since they provide reference points independently for each species assessed ignoring their interactions. For example, several studies suggest that even more substantial reductions in fishing mortality may be necessary to ensure MSY is reached when taking into consideration multiespecies interactions. Therefore, and as Pauly et al. (1998) stated, single-species analysis may mislead researchers and managers into neglecting the gear and trophic interactions which ultimately determine stocks long-term yields and ecosystem health. Ecosystem or multispecies models offer a number of advantages over single-species models. As stated in the workshop “Incorporating ecosystem considerations into stock assessments and management advice” (Mace, 2000) two general improvements are: a better appreciation of the fishing on ecosystem structure and function, and a better appreciation of the need to consider de value of marine ecosystems for functions other than harvesting fish. As disadvantages, multispecies models are statistically complex and include trophic relationships requiring more information (e. g. good estimations of biological parameters of each species and generally a full quantification of the diet sometimes available though the analysis of stomach contents). To reduce the number of species and therefore the amount of information needed, Minimum Realistic Models (MRMs) represent an intermediate level of complexity, where only the subset of the ecosystem, important for the issue under consideration, is modeled. This approach offers the advantage of allowing a refinement of our estimates and can help answer more targeted questions. Most multispecies models include interactions between commercially exploited species, since those data are more readily available. However, information is needed on at least both the main preys and predators of a selected stock. In the case of European Hake, the species we have focus our research on, cetaceans are their main predator, particularly common and bottlenose dolphins, which have been estimated to remove annually in the Atlantic shelf waters of the Iberian Peninsula, an amount similar to that caught by Spanish and Portuguese fleets (Santos et al., 2013). The European hake {{is one of the main}} fishing species of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets operating in the area, and one where more research activity has been concentrated, hence there is plenty of available biological information on growth, reproduction and trophic interactions. As a result, a population model has been built which uses trophic interactions to investigate the relationships between hake and other species. The European hake population is currently divided into two stocks, north and south. The <b>southern</b> <b>hake</b> stock, distributed along the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, is annually assessed by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO). For the assessment of this stock, “Gadget” a multi-specific modeling framework is used. Gadget allows the building of minimum realistic models that integrating the main trophic relationships among selected species considered to reflect the main processes in the system. Modeling cetacean populations can allow us to include complex trophic relationships in multispecies models. Furthermore, it will also be a tool to help cetaceans conservation by guiding possible management measures that ensure their viability or recovery. All cetacean species are protected by national and international legislation (e. g. Habitats Directive). However, modeling cetaceans dynamics has a number of problems due to lack of good information because, unlike the case of commercial fish stocks, usually there are no timeseries of abundance estimates available and the biological information available has been derived from the examination of stranded and/or bycatch individuals which could generate biased estimates. Common dolphin is the more abundant species of small cetacean in the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula and for which more biological information is available. For this reason, we have used this species as an example to explain our approach to obtain estimates of all the biological parameters needed to build a cetacean population model from strandings data. Southern European hake stock is distributed from Gulf of Biscay to Strait of Gibraltar, along Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, and thus the common dolphin population we will try to model is the one which lies in this area, although it is considered that there is a single common dolphin population is continuous throughout the European Atlantic coast (Natoli, 2008). Due to their protected status, no timeseries of catches neither fishing biological samples exist in the area, in contrast as in commercial fish species. Therefore, the major source of biological information is derived from strandings, mainly collected by experienced personnel from the “Coordinadora para o Estudio dos Mamíferos Mariños” (CEMMA) operating in Galicia (Northwest of Spain) since 1990. From these data we have derived the direct and indirect information required for our model. However, only the following parameters: maximum and minimum dolphin length and weight, sex-ratio and proportion of dead dolphins exhibiting bycatch signs can be used without further data processing. From these parameters, the length-weight relationship can also be easily calculated for both males and females, in our case, by fitting a logarithmic regression. Nonetheless, to fit a growth curve is necessary to know the age of each stranded dolphin and therefore, ageing the teeth (and sampling them from the carcasses) is required. In odontocetes teeth are commonly used for age estimations since dentine is laid down annually. Growth layer groups can be counted in tooth sections that have been stained and an estimate of dolphin age can thus be obtained. Once we have both length and age for each dolphin we can fit a Laird-Gompertz curve to model common dolphin growth. With length and age data we can build a maturation ogive estimating the L 50 and the A 50 (length and age at which half of the dolphins have already achieved maturity, respectively). For this purpose, we also require that a necropsy has been performed, so that gonads have been sampled and analyzed to estimate the maturity status. To define the trophic relationships in the model, we need to know the amount and proportion of each prey species in the dolphin diet. This information can be derived from the analysis of stomach contents that can back calculate the original prey size and weight by measuring the prey hard structures (e. g. fish otoliths, bones, cephalopod mandibles) found in the stomachs. From these data we can obtain estimates of daily dolphin consumption of prey by applying different energy requirement levels as Santos et al. (2013) did. All this basic biological parameters are relatively easy to calculate providing samples are collected and necropsies performed on stranded/bycaught individuals. However, other crucial parameters for the model such as mortality-at-age are harder to estimate from this source of information. We can assume that the proportion of observed ages in the strandings is representative of the absolute number of dolphins dead at each age. If we build a life table with the total number of stranded dolphins at each age we have a theoretical population structure which can be used to derive the proportion of mortality-at-age. Thus, we have an estimate of the total mortality experienced by each age class of the population. We are also interested in the natural mortality value and the approach we have followed to calculate this parameter is to use the evidence of bycatch in the carcasses, to subtract bycatch mortality from the total mortality for each age class. The value obtained is the “natural” mortality. Natural mortality is assumed to be the same for the whole study area; however fishing mortality is expected to be different because fishing effort is not equal in the whole study area. By relating the bycatch mortality obtained in Galicia with the fishing effort in the area, a relationship can be derived that allows us to obtain potential bycatch mortality for other areas where we only know the fishing effort. The last parameters that we have to estimate to finish building the dolphin population model are the population abundance and its trends. The best available abundance estimates for common dolphin and other cetaceans have been obtained from a sighting survey carried out in July 2005 covering the whole EU Atlantic continental shelf (Hammond et al., 2013). These estimates provide the only absolute estimate of common dolphin abundance in the shelf waters of the Iberian Peninsula. However, because the survey covered the study are only once, there are no information on trends in population size. To address this shortage, our approach has been to use again the time series of strandings. This time we model the influence of oceanographic variables such as rate of upwelling and intensity and direction of prevalent wind, as well as changes in fishing pressure, on numbers of strandings to disentangle the effects on stranding variability of oceanography, fishing bycatch and potential trends in population abundance. The uncertainty present in our estimates of some of these parameters arises from the lack of data. Thus the results should be treated with caution and keep working to obtain more biological data as well as further refinement to the data analysis needed to estimate these parameters from the existing data...|$|E
