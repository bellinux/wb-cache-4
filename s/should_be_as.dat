5|$|Stephen Russell Mallory (1812 – November 9, 1873) {{served in}} the United States Senate as Senator (Democrat) from Florida from 1850 to the secession of his home state and the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War. For much of that period, he was chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs. This was a time of rapid naval reform, and he insisted that the ships of the United States Navy <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> capable as those of Great Britain and France, the foremost navies in the world at that time. He also wrote a bill, and guided it through Congress, that provided for compulsory retirement of officers who did not meet the standards of the profession.|$|E
5|$|The second error charged (with some exaggeration) {{was that}} the Petrobrusians said, “Edifices for temples and churches should not be erected...The Petrobrusians are quoted as saying, 'It is {{unnecessary}} to build temples, since the church of God does not consist in a multitude of stones joined together, but in {{the unity of the}} believers assembled.'” On the other hand, the medieval Church taught that cathedrals and churches were created to glorify God, and believed it appropriate that those buildings <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> grand and beautiful as wealth and skill could make them.|$|E

25|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{previous}} statements, it is evident that cantilevers <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> long as possible, if their aim is to produce only a moment, while the force is less desirable. If, for example, a cantilever is used for the uprighting of a molar, which should not be extruded, the cantilever <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> long as possible or counteracted by a second cantilever.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{having gone}} through the above six stages, the phenomenologist <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> close as anyone can be to an {{understanding}} of the 'meaning' of the religious phenomena studied and be in a position to relate his understanding to others.|$|E
25|$|Design and {{construction}} are intimately related. To achieve a good workmanship, detailing {{of the members}} and their connections <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> simple as possible. As any construction in general, earthquake construction {{is a process that}} consists of the building, retrofitting or assembling of infrastructure given the construction materials available.|$|E
25|$|A {{ruling grade}} is often {{found at a}} long climb up to a summit. Ideally, the cutting at the summit <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> deep as possible, such as at Shap, as this helps {{reduce the amount of}} climb, and the {{steepness}} of the gradient. Alternately, a summit tunnel should be provided, such as at Ardglen.|$|E
30|$|Discussion: D&C <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{considered}} <b>as</b> {{an important}} risk factor in IUA formation, especially after recurrent procedures. This {{has implications for}} clinical practice, <b>as</b> D&C <b>should</b> <b>be</b> prevented <b>as</b> much as possible and adhesion formation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> taken into account when treatment options for miscarriage are discussed.|$|R
50|$|The {{conflict}} in Bougainville had multiple causes; {{there is not}} one single factor that <b>should</b> <b>be</b> isolated <b>as</b> a sole cause of the conflict. Instead, there is a series of predominant causes which can trace their roots directly to the Panguna Mine. Pan-Bougainvillean ethnicity <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> discounted <b>as</b> an important factor but <b>should</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>as</b> an external projection of economic and inter-ethnic grievances.|$|R
40|$|Horowitz (2000) [URL] {{argues that}} {{politics}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> viewed <b>as</b> war; participants in political discourse <b>should</b> <b>be</b> defined <b>as</b> friends or enemies; and arguments <b>should</b> <b>be</b> viewed largely <b>as</b> weapons. This makes valuing dissensus and {{a search for}} common ground naïve at best, and counterproductive and useless at worse. This essay will explore the nature of Horowitz’ position and the future search for common ground needed for the valuing of dissensus...|$|R
25|$|The {{element mesh}} should be {{sufficiently}} fine {{in order to}} produce acceptable accuracy. To assess accuracy, the mesh is refined until the important results shows little change. For higher accuracy, the aspect ratio of the elements <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> close to unity as possible, and smaller elements are used over the parts of higher stress gradient.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all of The Railway Series {{stories were}} based upon real-life events. As a lifelong railway enthusiast, Awdry was keen that his stories <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> {{realistic}} as possible. The engine characters were almost all based upon real classes of locomotive, {{and some of}} the railways themselves were directly based upon real lines in the British Isles.|$|E
25|$|Justice Harlan {{voted with}} the {{majority}} to reverse the lower court but also wrote a separate concurring opinion. Harlan particularly emphasized the special importance of constitutional rights. He presented that it was well-settled, even undeniable, that a suit for injunction based on a constitutional right had been long recognized in the Federal courts. However, a suit for damages <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> or more acceptable.|$|E

50|$|Later, some {{motherboard}} chipsets of Intel 80286-based computers implemented {{an expanded}} memory scheme {{that did not}} require add-on boards, notably the NEAT chipset. Typically, software switches determined how much memory <b>should</b> <b>be</b> used <b>as</b> expanded memory and how much <b>should</b> <b>be</b> used <b>as</b> extended memory.|$|R
25|$|For over 50 years, Israel {{requested}} {{the addition of}} a red Star of David, arguing that since Christian and Muslim emblems were recognized, the corresponding Jewish emblem <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> well. This emblem has been used since 1935 by Magen David Adom (MDA), or Red Star of David, the national first-aid society of Israel, but it is not recognized by the Geneva Conventions as a protected symbol.|$|E
25|$|The {{general rule}} for {{aromatic}} substitution is: ortho > meta > para. This gives non-selective β-blockers. Large para-substituents usually decrease activity but large ortho-groups retain some activity. Polysubstitution on carbon 2 and 6 makes the compound inactive {{but when the}} substitution is on carbon 3 and 5 there's some activity. For the highest cardioselectivity, the substituents <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> following: para > meta > ortho. All the β-blockade is in one isomer, (S)-aryloxypropylamine and (R)-ethanolamine.|$|E
25|$|The dispute also {{concerned}} {{the question of}} the economist's role, and whether this <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> a detached expert or a practical adviser. Despite the traditional view that the LSE and Cambridge were fierce rivals through the 1920s and 30s, they worked together in the 1920s on the London and Cambridge Economic Service. However, the 1930s brought a return to disputes as economists at the two universities argued over how best to address the economic problems caused by the Great Depression.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1920s the Yugoslav {{government}} of Serbian prime minister Nikola Pašić used police pressure over voters and ethnic minorities, confiscation of opposition pamphlets {{and other measures}} of election rigging to keep the opposition, and mainly the Croatian Peasant Party and its allies in minority in Yugoslav parliament. Pašić believed that Yugoslavia <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> centralized as possible, creating in place of distinct regional governments and identities a Greater Serbian national concept of concentrated {{power in the hands}} of Belgrade.|$|E
25|$|The table {{setup is}} {{important}} as well, and individual place settings, {{moving from the}} diner's left <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> follows: rice bowl, spoon, then chopsticks. Hot foods are set {{to the right side}} of the table, with the cold foods to the left. Soup must remain on {{the right side of the}} diner along with stews. Vegetables remain on the left along with the rice, and kimchi is set to the back while sauces remain in the front.|$|E
25|$|One {{desirable}} {{property of}} all PLLs {{is that the}} reference and feedback clock edges be brought into very close alignment. The average difference in time between the phases of the two signals when the PLL has achieved lock is called the static phase offset (also called the steady-state phase error). The variance between these phases is called tracking jitter. Ideally, the static phase offset should be zero, and the tracking jitter <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> low as possible.|$|E
