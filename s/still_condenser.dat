An anaerobic fermentation of substrate was adopted before distillation could be carried out. The fermented substrate was adjusted to an optimum pH level value of 4 - 5 by addition of 0. 1 M HjSQ, and the optimum temperature was within the temperature range of 29 - 38 °C. A charcoal pot was used as heat source. The results of the machine evaluation showed that optimum yield occurred at 0. 0325 ratio of substrate to ethanol yield. An average distilled product of 2. 1 litres was obtained at highest ratio of substrate to ethanol yield of 0. 033 when the distillation time was 45 minutes. The total distilled products after 1 XA hours of distillation was estimated at 4. 25 litres. It was observed that the fermentation and distillation processes were done in situ, and could definitely affect clear separation of the fermentable portion of the fermented sugar solution...|$|E

This study was conducted with p 3 NF-luc- 3 NF, a pDNA-bearing optimized kappaB motif to favour NFkappaB-driven nuclear import. Here, a quantification of pDNA copies in the nucleus was performed by real-time confocal laser scanning microscopy in HeLa and C 2 C 12 cells transfected with linear polyethylenimine or histidylated polylysine. Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) from the fluorescein-p 3 NF-luc- 3 NF donor to the co-localized rhodamine-polymer acceptor was carried out to investigate whether the pDNA was <b>still</b> <b>condensed</b> with the polymer in the nucleus. Upon 5 h of transfection, the nuclear amount of p 3 NF-luc 3 NF was approximately 1500 copies in both cell lines whereas that of pTAL-luc, a 3 NF-free counterpart pDNA, was less than 250. This quantity of p 3 NF-luc- 3 NF dropped dramatically to that of pTAL-luc in the presence of the BAY 11 - 7085, an inhibitor of NFkappaB activation. These data strongly support a nuclear import of p 3 NF-luc 3 NF mediated by NFkappaB. Moreover, FRET experiments clearly revealed that most of nuclear pDNA were <b>still</b> <b>condensed</b> with the polymer raising the question of their passage through the nuclear pore complex and their impact on the gene-expression efficiency...|$|R

We demonstrate that neural crest cells express the receptor neuropilin 2 (Npn 2), while its repulsive ligand semaphorin 3 F (Sema 3 f) is restricted to the posterior-half somite. In Npn 2 and Sema 3 f mutant mice, neural crest cells lose their segmental migration pattern and instead migrate as a uniform sheet, although somite polarity itself remains unchanged. Furthermore, Npn 2 is cell autonomously required for neural crest cells to avoid Sema 3 f in vitro. These data show that Npn 2 /Sema 3 f signaling guides neural crest migration through the somite.

In particular, we calculate the phyiscal electron spectral function. By using the functional integral approach, we developed a self-consistent scheme for the physical electron spectral function. A bandwidth of 8 t in the incoherent part of the electron spectral function is obtained both at half-filling and away from half-filling. At half-filling, we found a double-peak structure in the incoherent background of the electron spectral function and this structure persists to small doping regime. The spin-charge interaction also renormalises the holon quasiparticle bandwidth to scale with J. Upon small doping, the electron spectral function contains two dominant distinct features, namely a low-energy quasiparticle peak with bandwidth of order J, and broad valence peaks at energies of order t. The structure in the incoherent background is interpreted due to the strong spin-charge interaction near the points (0, 0) and ([pi, pi]) of the first Brillouin zone. The instability of bose-condensation of holon is also examined. We found that the spin-charge interaction is not strong enough to destroy the bose-condenation and a large fraction of holon <b>still</b> <b>condense</b> at zero temperature...|$|R

In the present study, polyallylamine (PAA) in two molecular weights (15 and 65 kDa) was modified by alkane derivatives {{in order to increase}} transfection activity and to decrease cytotoxicity. Materials and Methods: Modified PAA was synthesized using three alkane derivatives (1 -bromobutane, 1 -bromohexane and 1 -bromodecane) in different grafting percentages (10, 30 and 50). The condensation ability of modified PAA was determined by ethidium bromide test. The prepared polyplexes, complexes of modified PAA and DNA, were characterized by size and zeta potential.

40|$|AbstractBackground: In Drosophila, the gonads are {{composed}} of two cell populations: the germ line, derived from the pole cells, and a somatic component, derived from the mesoderm of abdominal segments 5 – 8. Formation of the gonad requires the function of a specific homeotic gene, abdominal-A (abd-A). Other genes of the bithorax complex, Ultrabithorax (Ubx) or Abdominal-B (Abd-B), cannot substitute for this requirement when abd-A is removed. Results We show here that, in embryos lacking the entire bithorax complex, experimentally induced expression of either ABD-A or UBX protein in the mesoderm will rescue {{the expression of a}} gonad-specific marker, 412 RNA. Ubiquitous expression of these homeotic proteins within the mesoderm results in the formation of ectopic gonad tissue anterior to the normal location of the gonads. In the absence of any endogenous bithorax-complex gene expression, however, mesoderm expressing gonad markers <b>still</b> <b>condenses</b> preferentially in the posterior segments of the abdomen, {{even in the absence of}} pole cells. Conclusion The specific requirement for abd-A and not Ubx in gonad development does not reflect differences in the properties of the proteins that these genes encode, but presumably reflects differences in their regulation. In normal development, the restriction of gonad formation to the posterior abdomen does not depend on the overlap of abd-A and Abd-B expression, but must depend on the regulation of abd-A and Ubx in the sub-population of the mesoderm that forms the gonad. Factors other than homeotic gene expression provide some cues that direct gonadal mesoderm to condense in the correct location...|$|R

The system has one basin in the evaporation chamber and two basins (middle and upper) in the condenser chamber, {{with a glass}} cover over the evaporator basin and an opaque condensing cover over the upper basin. The evaporator, middle and upper basins yield the first, second and third effects respectively. The top part of the condensing cover is shielded from solar radiation to keep the cover relatively cool. Water vapor from the first effect condenses under the glass cover while the remainder of it flows into the condenser, by purging and diffusion, and condenses under the liner of the middle basin. The performance {{of the system is}} evaluated and compared with that of a conventional solar still under the same meteorological conditions. Results show that the distillate productivity of the present still is 62 % higher than that of the conventional type.

The peculiar chromatin organization of rod photoreceptor nuclei, with a large central domain of condensed chromatin surrounded by a thin border of extended chromatin {{was used as a}} model to correlate in vivo chromatin structure, histone modifications and transcriptional activity. Methodology: We investigated the functional relationships between chromatin compaction, distribution of histone modifications and location of RNA polymerase II in intact murine rod photoreceptors using cryo-preparation methods, electron tomography and immunogold labeling. Our results show that the characteristic central heterochromatin of rod nuclei is organized into concentric domains characterized by a progressive loosening of the chromatin architecture from inside towards outside and by specific combinations of silencing histone marks. The peripheral heterochromatin is formed by closely packed 30 nm fibers as revealed by a characteristic optical diffraction signal.

40|$|Mounting {{evidence}} suggests that the eukaryotic cell nucleus is a dynamic and complex structure, and that changes in large-scale chromatin structure {{play an important role in}} gene regulation. In this study, we utilize the high specificity and affinity of the lacO-lacI tethering system to visualize changes in large-scale chromatin structure that accompany gene activation in an inducible BAC transgene system. Using light microscopy, and electron microscopy combined with in vivo immunogold labeling, we observe a 1. 5 - 3 -fold decondensation of a 1 - 2 Mbp chromatin domain composed of multi-copy BAC transgenes after transcriptional activation in interphase nuclei. Although the BAC transgene transcription levels are close to the levels of their endogenous counterparts after transcriptional activation, the BAC transgenes are folded within large-scale chromatin fibers with DNA compaction levels well above the extended 30 nm chromatin fibers predicted by previous models of the chromosome structure of actively transcribing genes. Furthermore, heat shock induced Hsp 70 BAC transgenes, but not other BAC transgenes, associated with the exterior of nuclear speckles with their transcripts accumulating within the speckle. Live cell imaging revealed three distinct dynamic events for Hsp 70 trangene nuclear speckle association. Further molecular dissection demonstrated association of Hsp 70 transgenes with nuclear speckles is transcription-dependent, independent of the identity of the transcribed sequences, relatively independent of the amount of transcripts, but dependent on the Hsp 70 promoter sequences. Moreover, despite similar levels of transcriptional activation, Hsp 70 transgene speckle association is observed after heat shock, but not after cadmium treatment.

Their results showed that the daily amount of the distillate of a still with an inclined reflector would be about 15 or 27  % greater than that with a vertical reflector when the reflector’s length is half of or the same as the still’s length. Madholpa and Johnstone (2009) carried out a numerical study of a passive solar <b>still</b> with separate <b>condenser.</b> They reported that the theoretical productivity was 62  % higher than that of the conventional still.|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} {{passive solar}} <b>still</b> with separate <b>condenser</b> {{has been studied}} theoretically and experimentally. The system has one basin in the evaporation chamber and two basins (middle and upper) in the condenser chamber, with a glass cover over the evaporator basin and an opaque condensing cover over the upper basin. The evaporator, middle and upper basins form the primary, secondary and tertiary effects respectively. The top part of the condensing cover is shielded from solar radiation and heat. Water vapor from the primary effect condenses under the glass cover while the remainder of it flows into the condenser, by purging and diffusion, and condenses under the liner of the middle basin. Outdoor tests of the present solar still and a conventional system were conducted at the University of Strathclyde. The two systems are also simulated under the same meteorological conditions. It is found that the solar shield effectively keeps the condenser cover relatively cool. Under favorable weather conditions the present solar still produced up to 34 % more distillate than the conventional type. Experimental and estimated results are in close conformity. It appears that the new solar still can be exploited {{within and outside the}} tropical region...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{study on}} thermal {{decomposition}} of four thiourea-metal complexes, solid precursors for spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD) methods, {{had been carried}} out by using thermoanalytical and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods in combination. [Cu- 2 (tu) (6) ]Cl- 2. 2 H(2) O (1), ZnCl 2 (tu) (2) (2), Sn 2 Cl 4 (tu) (5). 2 H(2) O (3), and SnCl 2 (tu) (4) prepared from aqueous thiourea (tu) solutions, had been decomposed in a simultaneous thermogravimetric/differential thermoanalytical (TG/DTA) apparatus, while XRD phase analysis of solid residues obtained at various temperatures had been performed. In static air, a main degradation step between 200 degreesC and 300 degreesC {{led to the formation}} of Cu 9 S 5 (digenite), ZnS (zinc blende), and SnSz (berndtite), respectively. Unfortunately, some chemical species with low volatility <b>still</b> remained in <b>condensed</b> phase, while above 400 degreesC, primary oxidation products of sulfides such as Cu 2 O(SO 4) (dolerophanite), ZnO, and SnO 2 also occurred. Nevertheless, intermittent spray pyrolysis depositions of Cu 2 SnS 3 and Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 films from some thiourea solutions with Cu(I), Zn(II), and Sn(II) onto glass substrates, with temperature ranging between 225 degreesC and 300 degreesC, were successful.
