5|$|DuPont's {{withdrawal}} {{also came}} months after John DuPont, {{heir to the}} Du Pont family fortune, {{had been arrested for}} the murder of Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz. At the time of the announcement of DuPont's discontinuation of sponsorship, Mike Plant reported that a 1997 event was tentatively scheduled for May 1–11, and that he had been in discussions with ten companies about potential title <b>sponsorship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race.|$|E
5|$|A Baptist {{church was}} {{organized}} at Monte Ne under the <b>sponsorship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Benton County Baptist Association {{as a result}} of a series of revival meetings conducted there. The Monte Ne Baptist Church is still active. For a time in the summer of 1946, the Rogers Intermediate Girl Scouts held a camp at the Hotel Frances (old Hotel Monte Ne). Although it was not as active as it once was, the old filling station and store in downtown Monte Ne continued to serve the local population.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Proms {{continued}} much as before. The second {{halves of}} concerts still featured piano-accompanied songs rather than serious classical music. Chappell's, having taken over <b>sponsorship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Proms and spent £35,000 keeping the Queen's Hall going during the war, wished to promote songs {{published by the}} company. The management of Chappell's were also less enthusiastic than Wood and Newman about promoting new orchestral works, {{most of which were}} not profitable.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} breweries, {{occasional}} special brews were commissioned upon commemorative dates and retirement of long-serving employees. In 1991 a special bottled beer was produced when Sheffield Wednesday reached the finals of the Football League Cup. Two thousand bottles of Stones Centenary Ale were produced in 1995, celebrating 100 years of rugby league. This {{was followed by}} the 1996 cask conditioned Stones Super League Bitter (4.8 per cent ABV) celebrating Stones' <b>sponsorship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> League, and the 1998 bottled Stones Commemorative Ale which marked the scheduled closure of the brewery.

40|$|Recent policy {{emphasis}} on market mechanisms {{to drive up}} <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> education systems has resulted in rising fees and increased competition in Higher Education (HE) in England, and in <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> different types of self-governing state funded schools run independently of municipal authority in compulsory schooling. University <b>sponsorship</b> <b>of</b> Charter Schools in the US raises issues which this article examines in relation to university <b>sponsorship</b> <b>of</b> academies in England. The article provides a quantitative overview <b>of</b> university <b>sponsorship</b> <b>of</b> academies over <b>the</b> last decade and explores how the policy context has shaped <b>the</b> discursive construction <b>of</b> <b>sponsorship</b> by <b>the</b> institutions concerned. Different patterns <b>of</b> <b>sponsorship</b> linked to institutional position and differentiated discourses of ‘sponsorship’ consistent with ‘academic entrepreneurship’ are identified. <b>The</b> discursive function <b>of</b> <b>sponsorship</b> is argued to extend to a legitimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> policy itself reflected in increasing government pressure on universities to sponsor academies...|$|R

5|$|Fans may wear a full {{or partial}} fursuit or other costume {{to express their}} {{identity}} and entertain others, though typically less than 15% of attendees bring a costume, and few of these wear them all the time.

Nearly all will wear one or more custom convention badges featuring a depiction of their anthropomorphic persona, some with attached ribbons providing an indicator of social status, such as a notice of affiliation, or <b>sponsorship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convention.

5|$|Avery Brundage, as {{president}} of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interests as he felt that the Olympic movement should be completely separate from financial influence. The 1960 Winter Olympics marked the beginning of corporate <b>sponsorship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Games. Despite Brundage's strenuous resistance the commercialisation of the Games continued during the 1960s, and revenue generated by corporate sponsorship swelled the IOC's coffers. By the Grenoble Games, Brundage had become so concerned about the direction of the Winter Olympic Games towards commercialisation that, if it could not be corrected, he felt the Winter Olympics should be abolished. Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant that the IOC was unable to gain a share of the financial windfall that was coming to host cities, and had no control over the structuring of sponsorship deals. When Brundage retired the IOC had $2million in assets; eight years later its accounts had swelled to $45million. This was due to a shift in ideology among IOC members, towards expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the field}} seasons of 1924 and 1925, Wheeler ran {{excavations}} of the Roman fort of Y Gaer near Brecon, a project aided {{by his wife}} and two archaeological students, Nowell Myres and Christopher Hawkes. During this project, he was visited by the prominent Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie and his wife Hilda Petrie; Wheeler greatly admired Petrie's emphasis on strong archaeological methodologies. Wheeler published the results of his excavation in The Roman Fort Near Brecon. He then began excavations at Isca Augusta, a Roman site in Caerleon, where he focused on revealing the Roman amphitheatre. Intent on attracting press attention to both raise public awareness of archaeology and attract new sources of funding, he contacted the press and organised a <b>sponsorship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excavation by the middle-market newspaper the Daily Mail. In doing so, he emphasised the folkloric and legendary associations that the site had with King Arthur. In 1925, Oxford University Press published Wheeler's first book for a general audience, Prehistoric and Roman Wales; he later expressed the opinion {{that it was not a}} good book.|$|E

5|$|The stadium {{was named}} the City of Manchester Stadium by Manchester City Council before {{construction}} began in December 1999, but {{has a number of}} commonly used alternatives. City of Manchester Stadium is abbreviated to CoMS when written and spoken. Eastlands refers to the site and the stadium before they were named SportCity and CoMS respectively, and remains in common usage for both the stadium and the whole complex, as does SportCity but with less frequency. The stadium was also officially referred to as Manchester City Stadium for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The football club, under its new ownership, renegotiated its 250-year lease with the city council in October 2010, gaining the naming rights in return for a substantial increase in rent. The stadium was renamed the Etihad Stadium by the club in July 2011 as part of a ten-year agreement with the team kit sponsors Etihad Airways. The agreement encompasses <b>sponsorship</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium's name, extends the team kit sponsorship for ten years, and includes plans to relocate the club's youth academy and training facilities to the City Football Academy on a new campus development adjacent to the stadium.|$|E
25|$|Buschwhacker is a {{term for}} NASCAR drivers who are regulars in the {{top-level}} Sprint Cup Series but who also compete {{on a regular basis}} in the second-tier Xfinity Series.
