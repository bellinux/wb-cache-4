5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is usually}} an acute and {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful, and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cases of}} croup are {{preventable}} by immunization for influenza and diphtheria. Croup is usually {{treated with a}} <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> of steroids by mouth. In more severe cases inhaled epinephrine may also be used. Hospitalization is required in one to five percent of cases.|$|E
5|$|OPV {{is usually}} {{provided}} in vials containing 10–20 doses of vaccine. A <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> of {{oral polio vaccine}} (usually two drops) contains 1,000,000 infectious units of Sabin 1 (effective against PV1), 100,000 infectious units of the Sabin 2 strain, and 600,000 infectious units of Sabin 3. The vaccine contains small traces of antibiotics—neomycin and streptomycin—but does not contain preservatives.|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} dosing modes, {{including one}} <b>single</b> <b>dosing</b> mode and two sequential dosing modes, were applied in high-arsenic contaminated water treatment. The results illustrated that the As (V) soluble and the As (V) nonspecifically sorbed were the insignificant species from Fe-As (V) samples in the sequential dosing mode, {{while they were}} higher in the <b>single</b> <b>dosing</b> mode. However, it could be further concluded that the mobility of the Fe-As (V) in sequential dosing mode was greater than that in <b>single</b> <b>dosing</b> mode. Besides, the main arsenic speciation governing the arsenic-borne coagulates was the As (V) associated with poorly crystalline hydrous oxides of Fe in sequential or <b>single</b> <b>dosing</b> mode. Moreover, the particle size distribution analysis indicated that the sequential dosing mode was more prevalent in neutralizing and adsorbing the As (V) compared with the <b>single</b> <b>dosing</b> mode. In the FT-IR spectra, the presence of arsenic was highlighted by a well resolved band at 825 – 829 cm− 1. The positions of the As–O stretching vibration bands were shifted gradually as the dosing mode changed from the single to the sequential. This result could be related to the distribution of arsenic speciation in different dosing modes...|$|R

5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate {{receptor}} modulator, {{became the}} first oral drug approved by the FDA, being followed in 2012 by teriflunomide, a drug that inhibits the synthesis of pyrimidine and disrupts the interaction of T cells with antigen presenting cell. Fingolimod and teriflunomide are taken through a daily <b>single</b> <b>dose.</b> In 2013 one further oral drug, dimethyl fumarate -or BG12- (which is an improved version of fumaric acid, an already existing drug), {{was approved by the}} FDA. Dimethyl fumarate is taken twice daily.|$|E
5|$|Metformin has an oral {{bioavailability}} of 50–60% under fasting conditions, and {{is absorbed}} slowly. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached within {{one to three}} hours of taking immediate-release metformin and four to eight hours with extended-release formulations. The plasma protein binding of metformin is negligible, as reflected by its very high apparent volume of distribution (300–1000l after a <b>single</b> <b>dose).</b> Steady state is usually reached {{in one or two}} days.|$|E
40|$|A <b>single</b> oral <b>dose</b> of 528 mg of {{bismuth subsalicylate}} (30 ml of Pepto-Bismol) had no {{significant}} effect on the plasma pharmacokinetics of a <b>single</b> oral <b>dose</b> of 750 mg of ciprofloxacin administered to 12 healthy volunteers (six men and six women). These results suggest that ciprofloxacin bioavailability will not be significantly decreased by <b>single</b> <b>doses</b> of bismuth subsalicylate when the two medications are administered simultaneously...|$|R

5|$|Side {{effects can}} include a {{decrease}} in efforts to breathe, low blood pressure, and sleepiness. Tolerance to its effects and withdrawal syndrome may occur following long-term use. Paradoxical effects, such as increased activity, can occur especially in children and older people. There is evidence of risk when used during pregnancy but no evidence of harm with a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> during breastfeeding. It is of the benzodiazepine class and works through the GABA neurotransmitter.|$|E
5|$|Uncomplicated infections can be {{diagnosed}} and treated based on symptoms alone. Antibiotics taken by mouth such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin are typically first line. Cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a fluoroquinolone {{may also be}} used. However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacterial that cause urinary infections has been increasing. The FDA recommends {{against the use of}} fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects. These medications substantially shorten the time to recovery with all being equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually sufficient, whereas nitrofurantoin requires 5–7days. Fosfomycin may be used as a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> but has been associated with lower rates of efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Nero's predecessor, Claudius, was {{allegedly}} poisoned with mushrooms or alternatively poison herbs. However, {{accounts of the}} way Claudius died vary greatly. Halotus, his taster, Gaius Stertinius Xenophon, his doctor, and the infamous poisoner Locusta have all been accused of possibly being the administrator of the fatal substance, but Agrippina, his final wife, {{is considered to be}} the most likely to have arranged his murder and may have even administered the poison herself. Some report that he died after prolonged suffering following a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> at his evening meal, while some say that he recovered somewhat, only to be poisoned once more by a feather dipped in poison which was pushed down his throat under the pretense of helping him to vomit, or by poisoned gruel or an enema. Agrippina is considered to be the murderer, because she was ambitious for her son, Nero, and Claudius had become suspicious of her intrigues.|$|E
40|$|Background: As {{all major}} insulin pump {{manufacturers}} {{comply with the}} international infusion pump standard EN 60601 - 2 - 24 : 1998, {{there may be a}} general assumption that all pumps are equal in insulin-delivery accuracy. This research investigates single-dose and averaged-dose accuracy of incremental basal deliveries for one patch model and three durable models of insulin pumps. Method: For each pump model, discrete <b>single</b> <b>doses</b> delivered during 0. 5 U/h basal rate infusion over a 20 h period were measured using a time-stamped microgravimetric system. Dose accuracy was analyzed by comparing <b>single</b> <b>doses</b> and time-averaged doses to specific accuracy thresholds (± 5 % to ± 30 %). Results: The percentage of <b>single</b> <b>doses</b> delivered outside accuracy thresholds of ± 5 %, ± 10 %, and ± 20 % were as follows...|$|R

5|$|Subsequently, Albert Sabin {{developed}} another live, oral polio vaccine. It {{was produced}} by the repeated passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at subphysiological temperatures. The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of wild poliovirus infection and replication, but the vaccine strain is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue. A <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> of Sabin's oral polio vaccine produces immunity to all three poliovirus serotypes in about 50 percent of recipients. Three doses of live-attenuated oral vaccine produce protective antibody to all three poliovirus types in more than 95 percent of recipients. Human trials of Sabin's vaccine began in 1957, and in 1958 it was selected, in competition with the live vaccines of Koprowski and other researchers, by the US National Institutes of Health. Licensed in 1962, it rapidly became the only polio vaccine used worldwide.|$|E

25|$|For this purpose, broad-spectrum benzimidazoles such as {{mebendazole}} and albendazole are {{the drugs}} of choice recommended by WHO. These anthelminthics are administered in a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> are safe, relatively inexpensive, and effective for several months. Mebendazole {{can be given}} with a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> twice a day for three consecutive days. Albendazole is given at a <b>single</b> <b>dose.</b> WHO recommends annual treatment in areas where between 20 and 50% of people are infected, and a twice a year treatment if it is over 50%; and in low risk situation (i.e. less than 20% prevalence) case-by-case treatment. In addition to these, pyrantel pamoate is also equally effective on ascaris. However, {{it has been reported}} that albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate are not entirely effective against T. trichiura with single oral doses in population-based control.|$|E
40|$|Summary. The {{response}} of an experimental sarcoma to <b>single</b> <b>doses</b> and two fractions of x-rays and fast neutrons {{has been investigated}} {{to test the hypothesis}} that slowly shrinking sarcomata will reoxygenate poorly and therefore will benefit more from fractionated neutron treatment than from fractionated x-ray treatment, in contrast with rapidly shrinking carcinomata. Neutrons were approximately three times more effective than x-rays, both for <b>single</b> <b>doses</b> and for two fractions given in 48 hours, when regrowth was used as a measure of response. This observation is closely similar to results previously obtained on a rat fibrosarcoma and contrasts with previous results from a mouse mammary carcinoma, and is in agreement with the hypothesis. MOST animal solid tumours have been found to contain hypoxic cells (e. g. Thomlinson, 1960; Hewitt, Chan and Blake, 1967; Van Putten and Kallman, 1968) and <b>single</b> <b>doses</b> of neutrons have bee...|$|R

40|$|Corticosteroids {{have been}} {{reported}} to decrease the plasma concentrations of salicylate when salicylates have been administered chronically at high doses. In the present study, two <b>single,</b> oral <b>doses</b> of sodium salicylate, 10 mg kg- 1 were administered to six adult subjects with a variety of inflammatory conditions both before and during treatment with daily oral doses of prednisone (12 - 60 mg). Concomitant prednisone therapy did not increase the whole body clearance of <b>single</b> <b>doses</b> of salicylate in these subjects (0. 0275 +/- 0. 08 l kg- 1 h- 1 before prednisone; 0. 0247 +/- 0. 03 l kg- 1 h- 1 during prednisone therapy; P greater than 0. 05).

2500|$|In its {{scientific}} {{opinion on the}} safety of caffeine of 2015 the EFSA concludes, that [...] "Consumption of other constituents of energy drinks at concentrations commonly present in such beverages would not affect the safety of <b>single</b> <b>doses</b> of caffeine up to 200 mg." [...] Also the consumption of alcohol, leading to a blood alcohol content of about 0.08%, would, according to the EFSA, not affect the safety of <b>single</b> <b>doses</b> of caffeine up to 200mg. Up to these levels of intake, caffeine is unlikely to mask the subjective perception of alcohol intoxication. Habitual use of caffeine up to 400mg per day does not.|$|R

25|$|For visceral {{leishmaniasis}} in India, South America, and the Mediterranean, liposomal amphotericin B is the recommended treatment {{and is often}} used as a <b>single</b> <b>dose.</b> Rates of cure with a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> of amphotericin have been reported as 95%. In India, almost all infections are resistant to pentavalent antimonials. In Africa, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin is recommended. These, however, can have significant side effects. Miltefosine, an oral medication, is effective against both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{a cumulative}} dosing procedure for drug discrimination with human participants. Four participants learned to discriminate triazolam (0. 35 mg/ 70 kg) from placebo. A crossover design {{was used to}} compare the results under a <b>single</b> <b>dosing</b> procedure with results obtained under a cumulative dosing procedure. Under the <b>single</b> <b>dosing</b> procedure, a dose of triazolam (0, 0. 05, 0. 15, or 0. 35 mg/ 70 kg) or secobarbital (0, 25, 75, or 175 mg/ 70 kg) was administered 45 min before assessment. Determining each dose-effect curve thus required four sessions. Under the cumulative dosing procedure, four doses of triazolam (0, 0. 05, 0. 10, and 0. 20 mg/ 70 kg) or secobarbital (0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/ 70 kg) were administered approximately 55 min apart, producing a complete dose-effect curve in one four-trial session. Regardless of procedure, triazolam and secobarbital produced discriminative stimulus and self-reported effects similar to previous <b>single</b> <b>dosing</b> studies in humans. Shifts to the right in cumulative dose-effect curves compared to single dose-effect curves occurred on several self-report measures.

25|$|A {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} study found that a <b>single</b> low <b>dose</b> of 10mg clomipramine to healthy volunteers resulted in 81.1% occupancy of the SERT, which was comparable to the 84.9% SERT occupancy by 50mg fluvoxamine. In the study, <b>single</b> <b>doses</b> of 5 to 50mg clomipramine resulted in 67.2 to 94.0% SERT occupancy while <b>single</b> <b>doses</b> of 12.5 to 50mg fluvoxamine resulted in 28.4 to 84.9% SERT occupancy. Chronic treatment with higher doses was able to achieve up to 100.0% SERT occupancy with clomipramine and up to 93.6% SERT occupancy with fluvoxamine. Other studies have found 83% SERT occupancy with 20mg/day paroxetine and 77% SERT occupancy with 20mg/day citalopram. These results indicate that very low doses of clomipramine are able to substantially occupy the SERT and that clomipramine achieves higher occupancy of the SERT than SSRIs at comparable doses. Moreover, clomipramine {{may be able to}} achieve more complete occupancy of the SERT at high doses, at least relative to fluvoxamine.|$|R
