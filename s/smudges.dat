5|$|The female {{is similar}} in some ways to the male, but paler and duller. It is sandy grey or brown, with a back {{patterned}} like that of the male, and white or whitish underparts. The head of the females of the subspecies ammodendri and nigricans is dingy grey with darker <b>smudges</b> on the forehead, behind its eyes, and on its throat. The female of the subspecies stoliczkae is buff-brown with a white throat, a conspicuous pale supercilium, darker forehead, and lighter cheeks. The juvenile is similar to the female, differing in its lack of dark tinges on its throat and crown. In adults, moulting begins in July and ends in late August or early September. The post-juvenile moult is complete, and occurs variously from June to August.|$|E

25|$|The common box turtle (Terrapene carolina) {{gets its}} common {{name from the}} {{structure}} of its shell which consists of a high domed carapace (upper shell), and large, hinged plastron (lower shell) which allows the turtle to close the shell, sealing its vulnerable head and limbs safely within an impregnable box. The carapace is brown, often adorned with a variable pattern of orange or yellow lines, spots, bars or blotches. The plastron is dark brown and may be uniformly coloured, or show darker blotches or <b>smudges.</b>|$|E
25|$|Japanese culture {{began to}} {{flourish}} {{in its own}} right during the Heian period, from 794 CE. At the imperial court the arts reached a pinnacle of refinement. Women started wearing extremely elaborate costumes, painting their faces more thickly, and painting eyebrows as ovals or <b>smudges</b> on their foreheads. One possibility is that when they started letting their hair hang down on each side, it was felt that the forehead became too prominent; painting the eyebrows as ovals halfway up the forehead was supposed to redress the balance of the face.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a mention}} of the Kuusamans rapidly {{building}} a new port in a newly conquered island by magic, which is evident from all buildings being the same (indicating that the spells made extensive use {{of the law of}} similarity). It is noted that only a country with many skilled mages could have spared the resources for such construction. In another place it is noted that printing is usually done by mechanical means, but the Valmieren resistance utilises magic for reproducing a propaganda sheet in order to avoid detection by the occupying authorities. The result of this magical duplication is readable, but the ink <b>smudges</b> easily as it was produced without the aid of a power point or an experienced mage.|$|E

25|$|The forest wildcat's fur {{is fairly}} uniform in length {{throughout}} the body. The {{hair on the}} tail is very long and dense, thus making it look furry and thick. In winter, the guard hairs measure 7cm, the tip hairs 5.5–6cm, and the underfur 4.5–5.5cm. Corresponding measurements in the summer are 5–6.7cm, 4.5–6cm, and 5.3cm. In winter, the forest wildcat's main coat colour is fairly light gray, becoming richer along the back, and fading onto the flanks. A slight ochreous shade is visible on the undersides of the flanks. A black and narrow dorsal band starts on the shoulders, and runs along the back, usually terminating {{at the base of}} the tail. Indistinct black <b>smudges</b> are present around the dorsal band, which may form a transverse striping pattern on rare occasions. The undersurface of the body is very light gray, with a light ochreous tinge. One or more white spots may occur on rare occasions on the throat, between the forelegs, or in the inguinal region. The tail is the same colour as the back, with the addition of a pure black tip. 2–3 black, transverse rings occur above the tail tip. The dorsal surface of the neck and head are the same colour as that of the trunk, but is lighter gray around the eyes, lips, cheeks, and chin. The top of the head and the forehead bear four well-developed dark bands. These bands sometimes split into small spots which extend to the neck. Two short and narrow stripes are usually present in the shoulder region, in front of the dorsal band. A dark and narrow stripe is present on the outer corner of the eye, under the ear. This stripe may extend into the neck. Another such stripe occurs under the eye, which also extends into the neck. The wildcat's summer coat has a fairly light, pure background colour, with an admixture of ochre or brown. In some animals, the summer coat is ashen coloured. The patterns on the head and neck are as well-developed as those on the tail, though the patterns on the flanks are almost imperceptible.|$|E

500|$|The speech Big Gay Al gave {{while taking}} Stan {{on a boat}} ride through his animal {{sanctuary}} were based on actual speeches animation director Eric Stough made {{while working as a}} [...] "jungle cruise director" [...] at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The dirt <b>smudges</b> on the football player's helmets and uniforms were intentionally designed to look like <b>smudges</b> on construction paper. This was done to maintain the show's deliberately crude visual style they first created with construction paper in [...] "The Spirit of Christmas" [...] and the pilot episode, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe". The characters Butters Stotch and Clyde Donovan are featured during the football game, although neither had been identified by name yet in the series. During a football crowd scene, a white character can be seen that looks identical to Token Black, an African-American character introduced later in the series. The background character is wearing the same shirt Token wears, which Parker explained was the result of an animator placing a different head on the body {{in order to create a}} filler character for the crowd. The moment when Big Gay Al says, [...] "My work here is done" [...] and disappears into a suitcase is Stone's favorite part of the episode, even though he admitted, [...] "It makes no sense". Parker said that the moment was written that way simply because the duo could not decide how to [...] "get rid of" [...] the character. Parker said, [...] "We didn't want him around all the time, (so we asked) how do we not make him a character each week".|$|E
500|$|In May 2012, Kaabi-Linke {{exhibited}} in [...] "Chkoun Ahna" [...] at the Tunisian National Museum of Carthage. The show, co-curated by her partner, focused {{on questions of}} Tunisian identity following the 2010 Jasmine Revolution. The artist's 2012 commentary work, Smell, displayed the Shahada Muslim declaration of faith in jasmine atop a black flag, symbols of Islamic extremism and Tunisia, respectively. The flowers would decay {{against the background of}} the flag. The same year, after meeting many survivors of domestic violence during her 2012 residency in the London Delfina Foundation, Kaabi-Linke wanted to publicize the prevalence of the often marginalized crime.

40|$|<b>Smudge</b> cells {{has been}} classically {{associated}} with {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} (CLL), but they are found in peripheral blood tests for other chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases (CLD). We investigated whether the percentage of <b>smudge</b> cells in peripheral blood smears {{can be used in}} the clinical practice to differentiate CLL from other B-cell CLD. The peripheral blood smears of 63 patients with the diagnosis of CLL and 62 with other B-cell CLD were analyzed. Three hundred cells (both lymphoid cells and <b>smudge</b> cells) were counted for each peripheral blood smear. A comparison of the percentage of <b>smudge</b> cells between the two groups was performed and, subsequently, 5 cut-off values were fixed (10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % of <b>smudge</b> cells) with the aim of defining cases as "positive" or "negative" for <b>smudge</b> cells and verifying whether there are any differences between CLL and the other B-cell CLD. The percentage of <b>smudge</b> cells in patients with CLL (median 26 %, 4 %- 86 %) was higher than in patients with B-cell CLD (median 14 %, 1 %- 64 %). However, none of the cut-off values tested presented suitable values of sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value to separate the two groups. As it is necessary to have a single cut-off value with high sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value to infer the diagnosis of CLL in the clinical practice, we concluded that <b>smudge</b> cells are not fitting to differentiate CLL from other B-cell CLD...|$|R

2500|$|The {{shoulder}} stripe is a [...] transverse or [...] "vertical" [...] marking {{that usually}} crosses the withers and extends down the shoulders. [...] Donkeys {{are known for}} their distinct shoulder stripe, which, when combined with the dorsal stripe, is sometimes called a [...] "cross". It is more marked in breeds closest to the wild African ancestors of the domestic donkey. [...] Indistinct or poorly defined markings in these regions are often called neck or shoulder <b>smudges,</b> patches, or shadows. Especially large markings are called neck or shoulder capes.

2500|$|The PSP {{received}} generally positive reviews {{soon after}} launch and most reviewers cited similar strengths and weaknesses. CNET awarded the system an 8.5 out of 10 and praised the console's powerful hardware and its multimedia capabilities while lamenting {{the lack of}} a screen guard or a guard over the reading surface of UMD cartridges. Engadget applauded the console's design, stating that [...] "it is definitely one well-designed, slick little handheld". PC World commended Sony's decision to include built-in Wi-Fi capability, but criticized {{the lack of a}} web browser at launch and the glare and <b>smudges</b> that resulted from the console's shiny exterior. Most reviewers also praised the console's large and bright viewing screen and its audio and video playback capabilities.

2500|$|The {{visual effects}} {{for the film}} were created by Montreal studio Rodeo FX. They spent four months working on the film, and {{according}} to visual effects supervisor Ara Khanikian [...] "visual effects touched 90% of the frames in the movie". A lot of the work was subtle. For example, stitching shots together, or creating the background for {{the windows in the}} hospital scene. Many shots in the film feature mirrors, and much work was spent removing the reflections of the crew from these. To accomplish this the studio created a 2.5D digital matte painting of the reflected environment. They then rotoscoped out the parts of the mirror not containing the foreground actors and their reflections, and replaced these with the digital environment. Some of the original shots captured <b>smudges</b> and dirt on the mirrors, so the studio developed a way to extract them so they could paste them back into the film. A matte-painting was constructed for the night-day time lapses in the film too, created by matchmoving and reprojecting shots of the buildings it features, captured at different times of the day, together. Rodeo FX also adjusted the pace of scenes. Iñárritu demanded a [...] "very precise rhythm and flow" [...] to the film, so the studio had to re-speed much of it with timewarp curves to fit the pacing the director desired.|$|E
2500|$|Horn's first {{photographic}} installation, You Are The Weather (1994-1996), {{a photographic}} cycle featuring 100 close-up {{shots of the}} same woman, Margret, {{in a variety of}} Icelandic geothermal pools, deals with the enigma of identity captured through a series of facial expressions dictated by imperceptible weather changes. Horn described her goals for this project in the Art:21 documentary series, [...] "“In the case of You Are the Weather, I was curious to see if I could elicit a place from her face, almost like a landscape. Not in the literal sense, but how close those identities were.” [...] Notes written by Horn about this work were included in the catalogue that accompanied Horn's 2009 traveling retrospective Roni Horn aka Roni Horn. The two-volume book included a Subject Index that brought together writings and reflections on works, themes, titles and topics related to Horn's practice. About You are the Weather, Horn writes, [...] "The way this work is shot and installed, the viewer is voyeurized by the view. You are surrounded by a woman who is staring at you." [...] Curator Donna De Salvo continues this suggestively erotic interplay between subject and object in one of her own contributions to the Subject Index, [...] "You are the Weather depicts a living, rather than an inert, thing. Horn complicated the notion of surface and skin. This treatment of the face <b>smudges</b> the distinction between object and subject. Just who is the 'you'? Of course all answers are completely dependent upon who chooses to inhabit the role of 'you.' It's a discovery process, which in some ways reflects the making of the work itself. The subtle and not so subtle difference in these photographs make it difficult for a viewer to dismiss any one image as being identical to the one next to it. 'You' have to look hard." ...|$|E
