40|$|We have {{constructed}} and characterized a flexible system for analyzing {{the phenomenon of}} <b>squelching</b> and estrogen receptor function in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The A/B region of the human estrogen receptor was replaced with the transcriptional activating domain of VP 16 and expressed in yeast cells from high-copy-number plasmids. Addition of hormone resulted in an immediate inhibition of expression (<b>squelching)</b> of a chromosomally integrated GAL 1 :lacZ reporter gene and the eventual arrest of cell growth (toxicity). In order {{to determine whether a}} relationship exists between toxicity and <b>squelching,</b> mutations were made in this chimeric receptor (VEO) and their effects on transcriptional activation, <b>squelching,</b> and toxicity were compared. A direct correlation was found between mutations in VEO that reduced VP 16 transactivation ability in yeast cells and those that reduced both <b>squelching</b> and toxicity. Surprisingly, mutations in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of VEO dramatically reduced <b>squelching</b> and completely relieved toxicity, suggesting a role for the DBD in <b>squelching</b> and strengthening the correlation between <b>squelching</b> and toxicity. To demonstrate the utility of this system for carrying out genetic selection, a plasmid-based yeast genomic bank was screened for genes that can relieve the toxicity of VEO by means of an elevated copy number, resulting in the repeated cloning of an allele of the PDR 1 (pleiotropic drug resistance) gene. We present evidence that mutations in PDR 1 can modulate the intracellular availability of estradiol by the same mechanism that leads to multiple drug resistance in yeast cells. Taken together, our results provide evidence that cell growth arrest occurs when <b>squelching</b> exceeds a certain threshold and that strong <b>squelching</b> requires both a DBD and a transcriptional activating domain. Furthermore, we show that growth arrest can provide a useful phenotype for carrying out the genetic analysis of both <b>squelching</b> and estrogen receptor function in yeast cells...|$|R

50|$|<b>Squelching</b> is a {{biological}} phenomenon {{in which a}} transcriptional activator acts to inhibit the expression of another gene. <b>Squelching</b> has been mostly studied in yeast, {{and most of the}} ideas regarding its mechanisms have come from research into modes of transcriptional control in yeast. One important study of this topic was conducted using the Gal4-VP16 artificial transcription factor system, where it was shown that the activating complex formed by VP-16 was sequestering adapters required for transcription of other targets.|$|R
25|$|The villain Shockwave {{revealed}} {{during his}} battle with Jaime that Kord Industries is {{now owned by}} the 100. He again came into conflict with Kid Devil, who still harbored a grudge against him because of both the future Titans incident and his status with Ravager. Jaime tries to mend fences with Kid Devil, but their squabbling allows Shockwave to escape. During their second battle with him, Kid Devil managed to tap into his demonic powers and partially melts Shockwave's armor, enabling the two boys to defeat him. This seems to <b>squelch</b> the ill feelings between them. Kid Devil asks Jaime if he's heard from Ravager and Jaime replies that he's faced down an entire alien race, but Ravager scares him. Kid Devil finally realizes that Jaime is being sincere and they shake hands and tell each other their real names. Later at Titans Tower Robin offers Jaime full-membership, which Jaime finally feels ready to accept.|$|E
25|$|In a dark, private lair in a tower {{high above}} the park, the Phantom (now {{revealed}} as Phantasma's owner and mastermind) interacts with an automaton that resembles Christine ("The Aerie"). In spite of the years that have passed and his many successes, the Phantom still longs {{to be reunited with}} her ("Til I Hear You Sing"). Meg intrudes and presses the Phantom for feedback on her performance, but he is distracted by his thoughts of Christine and dismisses Meg as an annoyance. Madame Giry is irritated that the Phantom still seems to think only of Christine after all that she and Meg have done for him over the years. Giry recounts how she and Meg helped smuggle him out of Paris and to a ship departing from Calais, on which they escaped to America. Ignoring her, the Phantom summons Miss Fleck, who appears with two other freak show performers, Dr. Gangle and Mr. <b>Squelch.</b> The Phantom has them dispatch a letter to Christine, inviting her to come and perform at Phantasma ("Giry confronts The Phantom/Til' I Hear You Sing (Reprise)").|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} rural Massachusetts {{suffered}} an economic depression {{after the war}} ended. Merchants, pressured for hard currency by overseas partners, made similar demands on local debtors, and the state raised taxes {{in order to pay}} off its own war debts. Efforts to collect both public and private debts from cash-poor farmers led to protests that flared into direct action in August 1786. Rebels calling themselves Regulators (after the North Carolina Regulator movement of the 1760s) succeeded in shutting down courts meeting to hear debt and tax collection cases. By the end of 1786 a farmer in western Massachusetts named Daniel Shays {{emerged as one of the}} ringleaders, and government attempts to <b>squelch</b> the protests only served to radicalize the protestors. In January 1787 Shays and Luke Day organized an attempt to take the federal Springfield Armory; state militia holding the armory beat back the attempt with cannon fire. A private militia raised by wealthy Boston merchants and led by General Benjamin Lincoln broke the back of the rebellion in early February at Petersham, but small-scale resistance continued in the western parts of the state for a while.|$|E

25|$|In {{a gloomy}} bar, Raoul contemplates his {{relationship}} with Christine. He is joined by Meg, who tells him she swims each day to wash away the stress of working. She tells Raoul that he must leave with Christine and Gustave and {{runs out of the}} bar ("Why Does She Love Me?"). Raoul says he is not afraid of the Phantom. Suddenly, the Phantom reveals himself to Raoul and they make a bet that if Christine sings, the Phantom wins and if she doesn't, Raoul wins. If Raoul wins the bet, the Phantom will pay his debts and Raoul can leave with Christine and Gustave. However, if The Phantom wins, Christine and Gustave will remain in America with him and Raoul must return to Paris alone. The Phantom also leads Raoul to question Gustave's paternity ("Devil Take the Hindmost"). Fleck, <b>Squelch</b> and Gangle appear to advertise Christine's appearance at Phantasma ("Invitation to the Concert"). That night, Meg performs a strip-tease about her choice of swimming costumes ("Bathing Beauty"). She successfully impresses the audience, but Madame Giry reveals to Meg that the Phantom did not watch the performance, saying it was for nothing ("Mother, Did You Watch?").|$|E
