Adverse impacts on geological features of human interest may occur in a coal strip mine. Geomorphic and geophysical features and outstanding scenic resources may be sacrificed by indiscriminate mining. Paleontological, cultural, and other historic values may be endangered due to the disruptive activities of blasting, ripping, and excavating coal. Stripping of overburden eliminates and destroys archeological and historic features, unless they are removed beforehand.|$|E

25|$|The Bengal <b>soil</b> <b>profile</b> {{impacted}} {{the famine}} in two ways. First, {{the soil in}} eastern Bengal, in combination with abundant irrigation from monsoon rains, was unique {{for its ability to}} grow large amounts of high quality jute. This gave Bengal an effective monopoly on a cash crop. Jute of lesser quality was grown in smaller quantities in western Bengal, but eastern Bengal was the clear-cut center of jute production. During the famine, jute-producing districts suffered higher mortality rates. Second, the sandy soil of eastern Bengal and the lighter sedimentary soil of the Sunderbans tended to drain more rapidly after the monsoon season than the laterite or heavy clay regions of western Bengal. As a rule, malaria epidemics lasted approximately one month longer in the areas with slower drainage. This problem was {{compounded by the fact that}} soil exhaustion created the need for large tracts in western and central Bengal to be left fallow; eastern Bengal had far fewer fallow fields. Flooded fallow fields are one key breeding place for malaria carrying mosquitoes, which was the biggest killer during the famine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Cone {{penetration}} test (CPT) {{allows for the}} soil type to be determined from the measured values of cone resistance (qt) and sleeve friction (fs). Since the cone penetrometer progressed from the mechanical cone to the electrical piezocone (CPTu), {{the reliability of the}} determination of soil type also improved by pore pressure (u) measurement. This paper references several published methods of <b>soil</b> <b>profiling.</b> All but two of these apply cone resistance plotted against the friction ratio (Rf). A new method for <b>soil</b> <b>profiling</b> has been developed by plotting effective cone resistance (qE) versus sleeve friction with a compiled database from 20 sites in 5 countries. This paper presents two <b>soil</b> <b>profiling</b> methods based on the piezocone and compares them with three specific cases containing sand, normally consolidated clay and overconsolidated clay.

40|$|Footings {{are often}} founded on multi-layered <b>soil</b> <b>profiles.</b> Real <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> are often multi-layered with {{material}} constantly varying with depth, which affects the footing response significantly. Furthermore, {{the properties of}} the soil are known to vary with location. The spatial variability of soil can be described by random field theory and geostatistics. The research presented in this thesis focuses on quantifying the effect of soil variability on the bearing capacity of rough strip footings on single and two layered, purely-cohesive, spatially variable <b>soil</b> <b>profiles.</b> This has been achieved by using Monte Carlo analysis, where the rough strip footings are founded on simulated <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> are analysed using finite element limit analysis. The simulations of virtual <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> are carried out using Local Average Subdivision (LAS), a numerical model based on the random field theory. An extensive parametric study has been carried out and the results of the analyses are presented as normalized means and coefficients of variation of bearing capacity factor, and comparisons between different cases are presented. The results indicate that, in general, the mean of the bearing capacity reduces as soil variability increases and the worst case scenario occurs when the correlation length is in the range of 0. 5 to 1. 0 times the footing width. The problem of estimating the bearing capacity of shallow strip footings founded on multi-layered <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> is very complex, due to the incomplete knowledge of interactions and relationships between parameters. Much research has been carried out on single- and two-layered homogeneous <b>soil</b> <b>profiles.</b> At present, the inaccurate weighted average method is the only technique available for estimating the bearing capacity of footing on soils with three or more layers. In this research, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to develop meta-models for bearing capacity estimation. ANNs are numerical modelling techniques that imitate the human brain capability to learn from experience. This research is limited to shallow strip footing founded on soil mass consisting of ten layers, which are weightless, purely cohesive and cohesive-frictional. A large number of data has been obtained by using finite element limit analysis. These data are used to train and verify the ANN models. The shear strength (cohesion and friction angle), soil thickness, and footing width are used as model inputs, as they are influencing factors of bearing capacity of footings. The model outputs are the bearing capacities of the footings. The developed ANN-based models are then compared with the weighted average method. Hand-calculation design formulae for estimation of bearing capacity of footings on ten-layered <b>soil</b> <b>profiles,</b> based on the ANN models, are presented. It is shown that the ANN-based models have the ability to predict the bearing capacity of footings on ten-layered <b>soil</b> <b>profiles</b> {{with a high degree of}} accuracy, and outperform traditional methods.
