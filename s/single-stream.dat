Some plants can now sort the materials automatically, known as <b>single-stream</b> recycling. In plants, a variety of materials is sorted such as paper, different types of plastics, glass, metals, food scraps, and most types of batteries.

A single void structure not only percolates the multistream field in all the directions, but also occupies over 99 per cent of all the <b>single-streaming</b> regions. Sub-grid analyses on scales smaller than simulation resolution reveal tiny pockets of voids that are isolated by membranes of the structure. For the multistreaming excursion sets, the percolating structure is significantly thinner than the filaments in over-density excursion approach. Hessian eigenvalues of the multistream field are used as local geometrical indicators of dark matter structures. <b>Single-streaming</b> regions have most of the zero eigenvalues.

25|$|Precoding is multi-stream beamforming, in {{the narrowest}} definition. In more general terms, it is {{considered}} to be all spatial processing that occurs at the transmitter. In (<b>single-stream)</b> beamforming, the same signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with appropriate phase and gain weighting such that the signal power is maximized at the receiver input. The benefits of beamforming are to increase the received signal gain – by making signals emitted from different antennas add up constructively – and to reduce the multipath fading effect. In line-of-sight propagation, beamforming results in a well-defined directional pattern. However, conventional beams are not a good analogy in cellular networks, which are mainly characterized by multipath propagation. When the receiver has multiple antennas, the transmit beamforming cannot simultaneously maximize the signal level at all of the receive antennas, and precoding with multiple streams is often beneficial. Note that precoding requires knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and the receiver.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Lagrangian {{theory of}} {{structure}} formation in cosmological fluids, {{restricted to the}} matter model “dust”, provides successful models of large–scale structure in the Universe in the laminar regime, i. e., where the fluid flow is <b>single–streamed</b> and “dust”–shells are smooth. Beyond the epoch of shell–crossing a qualitatively different behavior is expected, since in general anisotropic stresses powered by multi–stream forces arise in collisionless matter. In this paper we provide the basic framework for the modeling of pressure–supported fluids, restricting attention to isotropic stresses and to the cases where pressure can be given {{as a function of}} the density. We derive the governing set of Lagrangian evolution equations and study the resulting system using Lagrangian perturbation theory. We discuss the first–order equations and compare them to the Eulerian theory of gravitational instability, as well as to the case of plane–symmetric collapse. We obtain a construction rule that allows to derive first– order solutions of the Lagrangian theory from known first–order solutions of the Eulerian theory and so extend Zel’dovich’s extrapolation idea into the multi–streamed regime. These solutions can be used to generalize current structure formation models in the spirit of the “adhesion approximation”.
