40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the types of}} ground-level <b>shelters,</b> their availability and use by mammals and birds at Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho (PECB), an Atlantic forest area at southeastern Brazil. Eight types of <b>shelters</b> were found: <b>shelters</b> without tunnels under living trees, <b>shelters</b> with tunnels under living trees, <b>shelters</b> under mounds formed by adventitious roots, <b>shelters</b> under fallen trees, burrows not supported by trees or roots, riverbank <b>shelters,</b> stream tunnels and rock <b>shelters.</b> Mammal species that used <b>shelters</b> more frequently were Agouti paca, Philander frenata, Lontra longicaudis, Metachirus nudicaudatus and Trinomys iheringi. Utilization of <b>shelter</b> types and <b>shelter</b> topographic locations by these six species was roughly similar to the proportions in which <b>shelters</b> of different types and locations were monitored, {{with the exception of}} otters, which are semi-aquatic mammals and used mainly riverbank <b>shelters.</b> Contrary to expectations, animals did not choose <b>shelters</b> with entrances fitted to their sizes. <b>Shelters</b> were used either by a single species or by different species. I hypothesize that at the PECB other factors such as microclimate inside <b>shelters</b> must be more important in determining <b>shelter</b> use than <b>shelter</b> external characteristics or topographic location. Some species, as coatis Nasua nasua and probably small didelphids and birds, enter <b>shelters</b> to search for invertebrates and small vertebrates...|$|R

40|$|The escape {{behaviour}} of organisms that retreat to <b>shelter</b> to avoid predators {{is influenced by}} availability and quality (e. g. appropriate size) of <b>shelters.</b> We examined {{escape behaviour}} (flight initiation distance, distance fled to <b>shelter)</b> of the crab Leptograpsus variegatus, relative to <b>shelter</b> size and distribution on a shoreline with multiple <b>shelters</b> and on a shoreline with limited <b>shelter.</b> Larger crabs tended to be nearer to larger <b>shelters</b> than smaller crabs and fled sooner and further than smaller crabs. Larger crabs often fled past the nearest <b>shelters</b> if they were too small. Group size increased at the site with fewer <b>shelters,</b> but this did not influence flight behaviour. We conclude that the availability of <b>shelters</b> and body size influences escape behaviour of these crabs...|$|R

ABSTRACT: The master thesis explores, by analytic way, {{the life}} of clients in <b>shelter</b> for families with children. The thesis describes the specific <b>shelter</b> home in Prague - Horní Pocernice and observes its specifics {{in a context of}} other <b>shelters.</b> It maps the target group of users, who are mostly clients from Roma population. The thesis aims at clients' motives to live in a <b>shelter,</b> their coping with <b>shelter</b> norms and their adjustment of <b>shelter</b> rules to clients' own needs. It notices individual behaviors in a community of clients, describing interactions with social workers and between each other. The specific chapter is devoted to children as the youngest users of a <b>shelter,</b> their coping with the environment and the possibilities <b>shelter</b> home offers to them. The last chapter implies a certain similarity in <b>shelter</b> clients thinking with thinking of people living in an oral culture. The thesis disputes declared purpose of <b>shelter</b> home(s) as training of their own home living, since their repetitive "coming home" returns to <b>shelter(s)</b> witness another motives for <b>shelter</b> life as well.

One alternative method {{involves the use of}} <b>shelters</b> to avoid potential predators. This behavior, though frequently observed in hatchlings and juveniles, has never been studied in cuttlefish. Here, we shall address the importance of embryonic visual experience on the choice of <b>shelters</b> in hatchlings. For this, we incubated eggs in three different visual environments: (i) with white <b>shelters,</b> (ii) with black <b>shelters,</b> (iii) without <b>shelters.</b> After hatching, the cuttlefish were individually placed in a tank containing both black and white <b>shelters.</b> Both naive cuttlefish and those exposed to black <b>shelters</b> prior to hatching preferred hiding under the black <b>shelters.</b> The cuttlefish exposed to white <b>shelters</b> prior to hatching did not show any preference in <b>shelter</b> color. This study is the first to report the use of <b>shelters</b> in hatchling cuttlefish, their preference regarding black or white <b>shelters,</b> and the influence of embryonic exposure on this preference.
