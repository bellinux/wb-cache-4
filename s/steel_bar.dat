25|$|The {{reinforcement}} in a RC structure, {{such as a}} <b>steel</b> <b>bar,</b> has {{to undergo}} the same strain or deformation as the surrounding concrete {{in order to prevent}} discontinuity, slip or separation of the two materials under load. Maintaining composite action requires transfer of load between the concrete and steel. The direct stress is transferred from the concrete to the bar interface so as to change the tensile stress in the reinforcing bar along its length, this load transfer is achieved by means of bond (anchorage) and is idealized as a continuous stress field that develops {{in the vicinity of the}} steel-concrete interface.|$|E
25|$|Billet Steel: When a {{high quality}} {{camshaft}} or low volume production is required, engine builders and camshaft manufacturers choose steel billet. This {{is a much more}} time consuming process, and is generally more expensive than other methods. However, the finished product is far superior. CNC lathes, CNC milling machines, and CNC camshaft grinders will be used during production. Different types of <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> can be used, one example being EN40b. When manufacturing a camshaft from EN40b, the camshaft will also be heat treated via gas nitriding, which changes the micro-structure of the material. It gives a surface hardness of 55-60 HRC. These types of camshafts can be used in high-performance engines.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of an experimental campaign on the cyclic behavior of smooth <b>steel</b> <b>bars,</b> used as internal reinforcement of existing Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures; the stress-strain relationship is analyzed for different values of L/D ratio, where L is the stirrup spacing and D is the longitudinal bar diameter. Most of the experimental tests concerned smooth bars with L/D ratios ranging between 5 and 100. The analysis of the test results is complemented by some comparisons of the curves obtained by experimental tests on smooth <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> with those obtained by experimental tests on ribbed <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> The theoretical predictions obtained by existing models available in the literature on the cyclic behavior of ribbed <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> are then discussed.

25|$|Itoh et al. (2003) {{developed}} a scaffold {{consisting of a}} single large longitudinally oriented channel was created using chitosan tendons from crabs. Tendons were harvested from crabs (Macrocheira kaempferi) and repeatedly washed with sodium hydroxide solution to remove proteins and to deacetylate the tendon chitin, which subsequently became known as tendon chitosan. A stainless <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> with triangular-shaped cross-section (each side 2.1mm long) was inserted into a hollow tendon chitosan tube of circular-shaped cross-section (diameter: 2mm; length: 15mm). When comparing the circular-shaped and triangular-shaped tubes, {{it was found that}} the triangular tubes had improved mechanical strength, held their shape better, and increased the surface area available. While this is an effective method for creating a single channel, it does not provide as much surface area for cellular growth as the multi-channel scaffolds.|$|E

The addition increased the size of the complex to 5,179sqft(481m²). The addition was built with precast concrete floor and roof slabs connected to steel beams and columns. In 1966, the brick building was removed and was replaced by a three story building; at the same time, a third floor was added to the original building constructed in 1959. Overall, the second addition expanded the complex to 9,466sqft(879m²). In 1973, a third building was added with a 10ft(3m) corridor connecting to the existing building complex. The third building also consisted of three floors and had a floor area of 3,613sqft(336m²).

25|$|Domes {{built with}} steel and {{concrete}} {{were able to}} achieve very large spans. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Guastavino family, {{a father and son}} team who worked on the eastern seaboard of the United States, further developed the masonry dome, using tiles set flat against the surface of the curve and fast-setting Portland cement, which allowed mild <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> to be used to counteract tension forces. The thin domical shell was further developed with the construction by Walther Bauersfeld of two planetarium domes in Jena, Germany in the early 1920s. They consisting of a triangulated frame of light steel bars and mesh covered by a thin layer of concrete. These are generally taken to be the first modern architectural thin shells. These are also considered the first geodesic domes. Geodesic domes have been used for radar enclosures, greenhouses, housing, and weather stations. Architectural shells had their heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, peaking in popularity shortly before the widespread adoption of computers and the finite element method of structural analysis.|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} program was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} influences of <b>steel</b> reinforcing <b>bars</b> oil signals obtained from depth measurements of sui face-opening cracks in reinforced concrete structures based on transient stress waves generated by elastic impact. Numerical studies were performed to {{gain an understanding of}} the interaction of transient stress waves with <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> in concrete structures containing surface-opening cracks. A reinforced concrete beam was constructed as an experimental specimen. The specimen was simply supported and loaded at the center point until cracks occurred. Experimental studies were carried out on the cracked beam. Two displacement receivers were placed on the opposite sides of a surface-opening crack to monitor disturbances caused by the arrivals of stress waves generated by impact. The first receiver and impact were located {{on the same side of}} the crack. The first receiver was used to trace the start rime of impact. The second one placed oil the opposite sine of the crack was used to find the arrival time of P-wave propagating through <b>steel</b> <b>bars,</b> and the arrival time of the diffracted P-wave from the bottom edge of the crack, Numerical and experimental results show: that rite presence of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> results in an initial disturbance in the waveform recorded by the second receiver because P-waves call propagate across the crack along the <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> it is also shown that the shortest travel path Soi a P-wave from the impact point through the <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> to the second receiver is obtained if rile P-wave is incident upon the concrete/steel interface with a critical angle of incidence.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is to evaluate the effect of manufacturing process upon the performance of reinforcing <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> against atmospheric corrosion. Reinforcing <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> produced by different manufacturing methods {{were exposed to the}} atmosphere in Athens for different periods of time. The progress of corrosion was evaluated by measuring the thickness of the corrosion layer formed {{on the surface of the}} bars. The morphology of the corroded layer was studied by optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while X-ray diffraction analysis was used to identify the mineralogical composition of the corrosion products. Independently of the manufacturing process used, the main corrosion product formed was lepidocrocite (gamma-FeOOH), followed closely by akaganeite (beta-FeOOH) and goethite (alpha-FeOOH). Furthermore, it was found that the surface condition and the initial oxide layer on the <b>steel</b> <b>bars,</b> which is closely related to the manufacturing process, played a major role in the development of corrosion in atmosphere. Work-hardened reinforcing <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> were found very sensitive to exhibition in the usual atmospheric conditions, followed by the Tempcore <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> The hot-rolled bars, either unalloyed or microalloyed with vanadium, presented the best corrosion behavior.
