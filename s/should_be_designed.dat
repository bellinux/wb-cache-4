5|$|One current {{difficulty}} in {{the ideas of}} Geniocracy is that the means of assessing intelligence are ill-defined. One idea offered by Rael in Geniocracy is to have specialists such as psychologists, neurologists, ethnologists, etc., perfect or choose among existing ones, {{a series of tests}} that would define each person's level of intelligence. They <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> to measure intellectual potential rather than accumulation of knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, resulting in constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period}} than normal). A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction. As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) may appear. In such cases it may be helpful to use thickening agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. Gastrostomy to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the ship date back to 4 March 2005, in a {{proposal}} drafted by then-Minister of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs (which is now a nonexistent entity), Björn Bjarnason, regarding {{the purchase of a}} new vessel, in order to replace the aging ICGV Óðinn, and aircraft for the Icelandic Coast Guard. The Althing decided that this was an exigent matter, and so a high priority was placed upon the proposal. A needs analysis pertaining to the acquisition of a multi-purpose vessel and aircraft for the ICG was initiated on 31 September 2005. The main demands were that the vessel <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> for rescue work and patrolling, pollution prevention, fuelling search and rescue helicopters in flight, and meeting civil defence requirements anywhere around the country. In addition, it was to be equipped for response to, and prevention of, terrorist threats and be suitable for operations involving the police or customs authorities, and for all types of rescue and salvage work. The bollard pull of the vessel was to take account of the greatly increased volume of passenger and cargo shipping in Iceland’s economic zone and coastal waters.|$|E

25|$|One {{simple way}} to reduce the heat of {{decanting}} is to open valves slowly. With sensitive valves, such as needle valves, the gas can slowly be allowed through the valve so that the pressure increase is slow on the low-pressure side.

Sometimes 360-degree loops are present in the pipe-work to reduce vibration.|$|E
25|$|The Sultan's Copper Tents, {{originally}} three {{buildings for}} the palace guard, {{designed by the}} painter Louis Jean Desprez and built during 1787 to 1790. Desprez proposed that all the façades of the buildings <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> as three Turkish tents, clad in decoratively painted copper plate. However, tent façades were only built on the side facing the main lawns, which still gives the desired illusion of a sultan's encampment {{on the edge of}} the forest.|$|E
25|$|In {{the tension}} joint, the bolt and clamped {{components}} of the joint are designed to transfer an applied tension load through the joint {{by way of the}} clamped components by the design of a proper balance of joint and bolt stiffness. The joint <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> such that the clamp load is never overcome by the external tension forces acting to separate the joint. If the external tension forces overcome the clamp load (bolt preload) the clamped joint components will separate, allowing relative motion of the components.|$|E

25|$|At {{the most}} basic level, the best defense against floods is to seek higher ground for high-value uses while {{balancing}} the foreseeable risks with the benefits of occupying flood hazard zones.

Structures, such as bridges, that must unavoidably be in flood hazard areas <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>designed</b> to withstand flooding. Areas most at risk for flooding could be put to valuable uses that could be abandoned temporarily as people retreat to safer areas when a flood is imminent.|$|E
