5000|$|The 69W Proshift has a 47 mm Schneider Super-Angulon {{and makes}} eight 6×9cm {{exposures}} per roll of 120 film. The lens {{is mounted on}} a <b>sliding</b> <b>flange</b> which allowed for perspective control {{in the same manner}} as shifting the front standard of view camera.|$|E
50|$|The {{connecting}} flanges on column {{sections were}} not fully faced, the spigot {{which should have}} given positive location of one section in the next was not always present, and the bolts did not fill the holes. Consequently, the only thing resisting one <b>flange's</b> <b>sliding</b> over another was the pinching-down action of the bolts. This was reduced as boltheads and nuts were unfaced - some nuts had burrs up to 0.05 inch on them (he produced an example). This prevented any holding-down power, since if such a nut were used at a column base joint and the burr subsequently crushed, there would be over 2 inches free play {{at the top of}} the column. The nuts used were abnormally short and thin.|$|R
40|$|Possibilities to {{influence}} the deep drawing process during its duration are limited and generally consist of influences at the flange of the thin sheet, mainly by the contact pressure (the blank holding force). The common characteristics of previous investigations were setting of the fixed values of the blank holding force or the holder's pressure within the ironing tool. The objective {{of this investigation was}} the continuous setting of the variable pressure during the sliding process, via the preset functions, in order to analyze the variable pressure influence on the ironing process. This is why an experimental computerized device was designed and constructed for analyzing the influence of the variable contact pressure on the sliding process of the model strip during the flat-die test. The multi-parameter experiment was conducted; various materials of the tested pieces were applied (primarily thin sheet made of Al alloys and low-carbon steels sheet, with and without coating); different versions of the tool's contact elements were used, with various friction regimes and influential parameters (variable contact pressure during the sliding process, etc.). This experimental device practically represents a simulator for realization and studying of the physical model of an important segment of the ironing process in the completely realistic conditions (materials, tools, etc.). The aim was to find the optimal combination of the variable contact pressure and the tribological parameters, so that the punch force, as one of the process output parameters, would have the minimal value, as well as to avoid the undesired effects during the forming (difficult <b>sliding</b> of the <b>flange,</b> appearance of thin sheet's wrinkling, structural destruction, etc.). Understanding the mutual dependence of the holder's variable pressure and other influences should enable improvement of the ironing process control and should contribute to better understanding of the phenomena occurring at the thin sheet's flange...|$|R
