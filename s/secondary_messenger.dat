25|$|Gustducin is made {{of three}} subunits. When it is {{activated}} by the GPCR, its subunits break apart and activate phosphodiesterase, a nearby enzyme, which in turn converts a precursor within the cell into a <b>secondary</b> <b>messenger,</b> which closes potassium ion channels. Also, this <b>secondary</b> <b>messenger</b> can stimulate the endoplasmic reticulum to release Ca2+ which contributes to depolarization. This leads to a build-up of potassium ions in the cell, depolarization, and neurotransmitter release. It is also possible for some bitter tastants to interact directly with the G protein, because of a structural similarity to the relevant GPCR.|$|E
25|$|M-CSF acts {{through its}} {{receptor}} on the osteoclast, c-fms (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor), a transmembrane tyrosine kinase-receptor, leading to <b>secondary</b> <b>messenger</b> activation of tyrosine kinase Src. Both of these molecules {{are necessary for}} osteoclastogenesis and are widely involved in the differentiation of monocyte/macrophage derived cells.|$|E

40|$|Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) {{have been}} {{previously}} recognized as important secondary signaling molecules in bacteria and, more recently, in mammalian cells. In the former case, they represent <b>secondary</b> <b>messengers</b> affecting numerous {{responses of the}} prokaryotic cell, whereas in the latter, they act as agonists of the innate immune response. Remarkable new discoveries have linked these two patterns of utilization of CDNs as <b>secondary</b> <b>messengers</b> and have revealed unexpected influences they likely had on shaping human genetic variation. This Review summarizes these recent insights and provides a perspective on future unanswered questions in this exciting field...|$|R
50|$|Calcium ions or cyclic AMP (cAMP) act as <b>secondary</b> <b>messengers.</b> This is {{an example}} of {{negative}} control. The calcium ions activate phosphorylase kinase. This activates glycogen phosphorylase and inhibits glycogen synthase.|$|R
25|$|Many adaptor {{proteins}} and enzymes activated {{as part of}} signal transduction possess specialized protein domains that bind to specific <b>secondary</b> <b>messenger</b> molecules. For example, calcium ions bind to the EF hand domains of calmodulin, allowing it to bind and activate calmodulin-dependent kinase. PIP3 and other phosphoinositides {{do the same thing}} to the Pleckstrin homology domains of proteins such as the kinase protein AKT.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{player in}} the process is transforming growth factor (TGFβ). This protein appears to be overproduced, and the fibroblast (possibly in response to other stimuli) also overexpresses the receptor for this mediator. An intracellular pathway (consisting of SMAD2/SMAD3, SMAD4 and the inhibitor SMAD7) {{is responsible for the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>messenger</b> system that induces transcription of the proteins and enzymes responsible for collagen deposition. Sp1 is a transcription factor most closely studied in this context. Apart from TGFβ, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) has a possible role. Indeed, a common CTGF gene polymorphism is present at an increased rate in systemic sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|The Insulin Receptor {{is a type}} of {{tyrosine}} kinase receptor, in which the binding of an agonistic ligand triggers autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues, with each subunit phosphorylating its partner. The addition of the phosphate groups generates a binding site for the insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1), which is subsequently activated via phosphorylation. The activated IRS-1 initiates the signal transduction pathway and binds to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), in turn causing its acivation. This then catalyses the conversion of Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate into Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 acts as a <b>secondary</b> <b>messenger</b> and induces the activation of phosphatidylinositol dependant protein kinase, which then activates several other kinases – most notably Akt, (also known as protein kinase B). Akt triggers the translocation of glucose transporter (GLUT4) containing vesicles to the cell membrane, via the activation of SNARE proteins, to facilitate the diffusion of glucose into the cell. Akt also phosphorylates and inhibits glycogen synthase kinase, which is an enzyme that inhibits glycogen synthase. Therefore, Akt acts to start the process of glycogenesis, which ultimately reduces blood-glucose concentration.|$|E
50|$|As {{a member}} of the connexin family, GJA1 is a {{component}} of gap junctions, which are intercellular channels that connect adjacent cells to permit the exchange of low molecular weight molecules, such as small ions and <b>secondary</b> <b>messengers,</b> to maintain homeostasis.|$|R
5000|$|... myo-Inositol {{plays an}} {{important}} role as the structural basis for a number of <b>secondary</b> <b>messengers</b> in eukaryotic cells, the various inositol phosphates. In addition, inositol serves as {{an important component of the}} structural lipids phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its various phosphates, the phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) lipids.|$|R
5000|$|Activation of the gamma isoforms of {{phospholipase}} C (PLCγ) (see PLCG1 and PLCG2 illustrates one {{mechanism by}} which FGFR1 activates cell stimulating pathways. Following its binding of a proper FGF and subsequent pairing with another FGFR, FGFR1 becomes phosphorylated by its partner FGFR on a highly conserved tyrosine residue (Y766) at its C-terminal. This creates a binding or [...] "docking" [...] site to recruit PLCγ via PLCγ tandem nSH2 and cSH2 domains and then phosphorylate PLCγ. By being phosphorylated PLCγ is relieved of its auto-inhibition structure and becomes active in metabolizing nearby Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to two <b>secondary</b> <b>messengers,</b> inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacyglycerol (DAG). These <b>secondary</b> <b>messengers</b> proceed to mobilize other cell-signaling and cell-activating agents: IP3 elevates cytosolic Ca2+ and thereby various Ca2+-sensitive elements while DAG activates various protein kinase C isoforms.|$|R
25|$|Research {{indicates}} ethanol {{is involved}} in the inhibition of L-type calcium channels. One study showed the nature of ethanol binding to L-type calcium channels is according to first-order kinetics with a Hill coefficient around 1. This indicates ethanol binds independently to the channel, expressing noncooperative binding. Early studies showed a link between calcium and the release of vasopressin by the <b>secondary</b> <b>messenger</b> system. Vasopressin levels are reduced after the ingestion of alcohol. The lower levels of vasopressin from the consumption of alcohol have been linked to ethanol acting as an antagonist to voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Studies conducted by Treistman et al. in the aplysia confirm inhibition of VGCC by ethanol. Voltage clamp recordings have been done on the aplysia neuron. VGCCs were isolated and calcium current was recorded using patch clamp technique having ethanol as a treatment. Recordings were replicated at varying concentrations (0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mM) at a voltage clamp of +30 mV. Results showed calcium current decreased as concentration of ethanol increased. Similar results have shown to be true in single-channel recordings from isolated nerve terminal of rats that ethanol does in fact block VGCCs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{activated}} IRS-1 {{acts as a}} <b>secondary</b> <b>messenger</b> {{within the}} cell to stimulate the transcription of insulin-regulated genes. [...] First, the protein Grb2 binds the P-Tyr residue of IRS-1 in its SH2 domain. [...] Grb2 is then able to bind SOS, which in turn catalyzes the replacement of bound GDP with GTP on Ras, a G protein. [...] This protein then begins a phosphorylation cascade, culminating in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which enters the nucleus and phosphorylates various nuclear transcription factors (such as Elk1).|$|E
2500|$|The second {{mechanism}} {{depends on}} a second messenger cascade regulating gene transcription {{and changes in the}} levels of key proteins at synapses such as CaMKII and PKAII. Activation of the second messenger pathway leads to increased levels of CaMKII and PKAII within the dendritic spine. These protein kinases have been linked to growth in dendritic spine volume and LTP processes such as the addition of AMPA receptors to the plasma membrane and phosphorylation of ion channels for enhanced permeability. Localization or compartmentalization of activated proteins occurs in the presence of their given stimulus which creates local effects in the dendritic spine. Calcium influx from NMDA receptors is necessary for the activation of CaMKII. This activation is localized to spines with focal stimulation and is inactivated before spreading to adjacent spines or the shaft, indicating an important mechanism of LTP in that particular changes in protein activation can be localized or compartmentalized to enhance the responsivity of single dendritic spines. Individual dendritic spines are capable of forming unique responses to presynaptic cells. This second mechanism can be triggered by protein phosphorylation but takes longer and lasts longer, providing the mechanism for long-lasting memory storage. [...] The duration of the LTP can be regulated by breakdown of these second messengers. [...] Phosphodiesterase, for example, breaks down the <b>secondary</b> <b>messenger</b> cAMP, which has been implicated in increased AMPA receptor synthesis in the post-synaptic neuron [...]|$|E

Phosphorylated derivatives of ribose such as ATP and NADH play central roles in metabolism. cAMP and cGMP, formed from ATP and GTP, serve as <b>secondary</b> <b>messengers</b> in some signalling pathways.|$|R
5000|$|Inositol monophosphatase {{plays an}} {{important}} role in maintaining intracellular levels of myo-inositol, a molecule that forms the structural basis of several <b>secondary</b> <b>messengers</b> in eukaryotic cells. IMPase dephosphorylates the isomers of inositol monophosphate to produce inositol, mostly in the form of the stereoisomer, myo-inositol. Inositol monophosphatase is able to regulate inositol homeostasis because it lies at the convergence of two pathways that generate inositol: ...|$|R
5000|$|Profilin, is a cytosolic protein with a {{molecular}} weight of 15 kDa, which also binds with G-actin-ATP or -ADP with a stoichiometry of 1:1, {{but it has}} a different function as it facilitates the replacement of ADP nucleotides by ATP.

5000|$|The primary {{effector}} {{then has}} an action, which creates {{a signal that}} can diffuse within the cell. This signal is called the [...] "second (or secondary) messenger."

50|$|A line of {{research}} investigates long term potentiation (LTP), a process that describes how a memory can be consolidated between two neurons, or brain cells, ultimately by creating a circuit within the brain that can encode a memory. To initiate a learning circuit between two neurons, one prominent study described using tetanus stimulations to depolarize one neuron by 30mV, which, in turn, activated its NMDA glutamate receptors (Nowak, Bregestovski, Ascher, Herbert, & Prochiantz, 1984). The activation of these receptors resulted in Ca2+ flooding the cell, initiating a cascade of <b>secondary</b> <b>messengers.</b> The cascade of resulting reactions, brought about by <b>secondary</b> <b>messengers,</b> terminates with the activation of cAMP response binding element protein (CREB), which acts as a transcription factor for various genes and initiates their expression (Hawkins, Kandel, & Bailey, 2006). Some proponents argue that the genes stimulate changes in communication between neurons, which underlie the encoding of memory; others suggest that the genes are byproducts of the LTP signaling pathway and are not directly involved in LTP. However, following the cascade of <b>secondary</b> <b>messengers,</b> no one would dispute that more AMPA receptors appear in the postsynaptic terminal (Hayashi et al., 2000). Higher numbers of AMPA receptors, taken together with the aforementioned events, allow for increased firing potential in the postsynaptic cell, which creates an improved learning circuit between these two neurons (Hayashi et al., 2000). Because of the specific, activity-dependent nature of LTP, it is an ideal model for a neural correlate of memory, as postulated by numerous studies; together, these {{studies show that the}} abolishment of LTP prevents the formation of memory at the neuronal level (Hawkins, Kandel, & Bailey, 2006).|$|R

[...] cAMP and cGMP are currently the most well documented cyclic nucleotides, however there is evidence that cCMP (cytosine) is also involved in eukaryotic cellular messaging.

2500|$|Though the {{processes}} involved in secondary brain injury are still poorly understood, it is now accepted that stretching of axons during injury causes physical disruption to and proteolytic degradation of the cytoskeleton. It also opens sodium channels in the axolemma, which causes voltage-gated calcium channels to open and Ca2+ to flow into the cell. [...] The intracellular presence of Ca2+ unleashes several different pathways, including activating phospholipases and proteolytic enzymes, damaging mitochondria and the cytoskeleton, and activating <b>secondary</b> <b>messengers,</b> {{which can lead to}} separation of the axon and death of the cell.|$|R

There are many classes of exopolyphosphatases, each with their own unique localization and properties.

50|$|D5 {{receptor}} is a subtype of the dopamine receptor {{that has}} a 10-fold higher affinity for dopamine than the D1 subtype. The D5 subtype is a G-protein coupled receptor, which promotes synthesis of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase via activation of Gαs/olf family of G proteins. Both D5 and D1 subtypes activate adenylyl cyclase. D1 receptors were shown to stimulate monophasic dose-dependent accumulation of cAMP in response to dopamine, and the D5 receptors were able to stimulate biphasic accumulation of cAMP under the same conditions, suggesting that D5 receptors may use a different system of <b>secondary</b> <b>messengers</b> than D1 receptors.|$|R

It is their specific distribution and catabolism that enables them carry out the biological response processes listed above. Their roles as storage centers for <b>secondary</b> <b>messengers</b> in the membrane is also a contributing factor {{to their ability to}} act as transporters.
