However, in a November 2009 interview, Keenan stated: [...] "Efforts to confine our beloved enigma to the Southwestern United States have been thwarted.

Sweeney did not know; Purnell told him it was about $2 billion. He then asked if Sweeney knew how much his {{aircraft}} was worth. This Sweeney did know; over half a million dollars. Purnell then told him: [...] "I'd <b>suggest</b> <b>you</b> keep those relative values in mind for this mission." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1933, Gernsback {{dismissed}} Lasser as editor. Lasser {{had become}} active in promoting workers' rights and was spending less {{time on his}} editorial duties. According to Lasser, Gernsback told him [...] "if you like working with the unemployed so much, I <b>suggest</b> <b>you</b> go and join them". It is likely that cost-cutting was also a consideration, as Lasser was paid $65 per week, a substantial salary in those days. Soon after Lasser was let go, Gernsback received a fanzine, The Fantasy Fan, from a reader, Charles Hornig. Gernsback called Hornig to his office to interview him for the position of editor; Hornig {{turned out to be}} only17, but Gernsback asked him to proofread a manuscript and decided that the results were satisfactory. Hornig was hired at an initial salary of $20 per week. That same year, Gernsback dissolved Stellar Publications and created Continental Publications as the new publisher for Wonder Stories. The schedule stuttered for the first time, missing the July and September 1933 issues; the recent bankruptcy of the company's distributor, Eastern Distributing Corporation, may have been partly responsible for this disruption. The first issue with Continental on the masthead, and the first listing Hornig as editor, was November 1933.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, a {{backlash}} to the libel suit {{filed by the}} British Chiropractic Association (BCA) against Simon Singh, has inspired the filing of formal complaints of false advertising against more than 500 individual chiropractors within one 24-hour period, prompting the McTimoney Chiropractic Association to write to its members advising them to remove leaflets that make claims about whiplash and colic from their practice, {{to be wary of}} new patients and telephone inquiries, and telling their members: [...] "If you have a website, take it down NOW." [...] and [...] "Finally, we strongly <b>suggest</b> <b>you</b> do NOT discuss this with others, especially patients." [...] An editorial in Nature has suggested that the BCA may be trying to suppress debate and that this use of British libel law is a burden on the right to freedom of expression, which is protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. The libel case ended with the BCA withdrawing its suit in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|St. Mary's also {{competed in}} the Hampshire Senior Cup in 1892–93, hoping to claim a third {{consecutive}} victory. After 2–0 wins over the Royal Engineers and a side from Portsmouth, they reached the final against local rivals Freemantle. The final was played on 11 March 1893 at the County Ground {{in front of a}} substantial crowd who threatened to spill onto the pitch. Freemantle led 1–0 at half-time before Jack Dollin equalised. With the score 1–1 and only a few minutes left to play, a Freemantle forward, Horton, was about to score past Ralph Ruffell in the Saints' goal when he was tripped by William Stride. Despite protests from the [...] "Saints", the referee awarded a penalty to Freemantle, which was converted by Shirley Hawkins, giving Freemantle their first trophy. After the match, Carter protested to the referee that the foul had been committed outside the penalty area, saying that he could point out the exact spot where the offence occurred. The referee, Mr. Royston Bourke, replied: [...] "In that case, I <b>suggest</b> <b>you</b> have a tombstone erected over it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw {{gave the}} film four stars in September 2001, {{choosing}} {{it as the}} best film of the week. He praised Takeshi Kitano's performance as the teacher {{and some of the}} scenes as [...] "a stunningly proficient piece of action film-making, plunging us into a world of delirium and fear." [...] He notes that, among [...] "the hail of bullets and the queasy gouts of blood, troubling narratives of yearning and sadness are played out. It is as if the violence of Battle Royale is not a satire of society at all, but simply a metaphor for the anguish of adolescent existence." [...] He concluded that, while some [...] "will find the explicit violence of this movie repulsive", it [...] "is a film put together with remarkable confidence and flair. Its steely candour, and weird, passionate urgency make it compelling." [...] Bryant Frazer of Deep Focus [...] gave it a B+ rating and called it [...] "a vicious take-off on reality TV that turns a high-school milieu dominated by cliques and childish relationships into a war zone." [...] British critic Jonathan Ross stated that [...] "if you want to catch a wildly original and super-cool slice of entertainment before it gets remade and ruined by the Americans, then I <b>suggest</b> <b>you</b> try hard not to miss it" [...] and concluded that [...] "it's a wildly imaginative example of just what can be achieved in a teen movie." [...] In 2009, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised Battle Royale as the best film he had seen in the past two decades, stating that, [...] "If there’s any movie that’s been made since I’ve been making movies that I wish I had made, it’s that one." ...|$|E
