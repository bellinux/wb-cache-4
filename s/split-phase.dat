25|$|NEMA 6 devices, while {{specified}} as 250V, may be {{used for}} either 208 or 240V circuits, generally depending on whether the building has a three-phase or <b>split-phase</b> power supply, respectively. The NEMA 6-20R or 6-30R found in many hotel rooms is typically supplied with three-phase 208V.|$|E
25|$|Some tampers {{bypass the}} meter, wholly or in part. Safe tampers {{of this type}} {{normally}} increase the neutral current at the meter. Most <b>split-phase</b> residential meters in the United States are unable to detect neutral currents. However, modern tamper-resistant meters can detect and bill it at standard rates.|$|E
25|$|All NEMA 14 devices offer two hots, a neutral, and a ground, {{allowing}} for both 120 and 240V when supplied by <b>split-phase</b> power, or 120 and 208V if the supply is three-phase. The 14-30 has {{a rating of}} 30A, and an L-shaped neutral blade. The 14-50 has a rating of 50A, and a straight neutral blade sized {{so that it does}} not mate with 14-30 connectors.|$|E
40|$|Existing intersections and {{interchange}} designs can be deficient due to {{the inability}} to accommodate common traffic patterns and due to road networks being originally engineered for a strong hierarchy of intersecting roads when currently many intersecting roads have similar characteristics. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to introduce two new designs, developed by the author, which can accommodate the traffic patterns at major intersections and interchanges. The intersection design is called the “synchronized-split phasing intersection”. The interchange design is called the “diverging diamond interchange”. These designs take advantage of the benefits of <b>split-phasing</b> and signal synchronization to theoretically improve signal timing at heavy volume intersections or heavy turning movements. Simulations were conducted to compare the delay and total stops of these new designs to other conventional designs. The results showed that the synchronized <b>split-phasing</b> intersection and the diverging diamond interchange operated much more efficiently then the original designs. There seems to be great potential for these designs, although more research would be needed to look into alterations in traffic patterns and signal spacing, as well a...|$|R
5000|$|There is a rarely used, unnamed type of {{interchange}} using a grade-separated design, {{similar to}} the at-grade design known as a [...] "synchronized <b>split-phasing</b> intersection". It is somewhat like the diverging windmill except that left turn exits use left directional ramps, which, as with the diverging windmill, merge on the left. One such interchange formerly existed between Interstate 95 and I-695 north of Baltimore, which has since {{been replaced by a}} four-level stack. There are few of these [...] "synchronized split-phasing" [...] interchanges, including one in Birmingham, Alabama between I-65 and I-20/I-59, locally called Malfunction Junction. A variation of this type exists in Grand Rapids, Michigan between Interstate 196 and US 131, where only the opposing carriageways of US 131 cross over each other, while the carriageways for I-196 do not cross over, but pass through the interchange on different levels.|$|R
2500|$|In {{single phase}} {{squirrel}} cage motors, the primary winding within the motor housing is {{not capable of}} starting a rotational motion on the rotor, but is capable of sustaining one. To start the motor, a secondary [...] "start" [...] winding has a series non-polarized starting capacitor to introduce a lead in the sinusoidal current. When the secondary (start) winding is placed at an angle {{with respect to the}} primary (run) winding, a rotating electric field is created. The force of the rotational field is not constant, but is sufficient to start the rotor spinning. When the rotor comes close to operating speed, a centrifugal switch (or current-sensitive relay in series with the main winding) disconnects the capacitor. The start capacitor is typically mounted {{to the side of the}} motor housing. These are called capacitor-start motors, that have relatively high starting torque. Typically they can have up-to four times as much starting torque than a <b>split-phase</b> motor and are used on applications such as compressors, pressure washers and any small device requiring high starting torques.|$|E
50|$|A {{capacitor}} {{start motor}} is a <b>split-phase</b> induction motor with a starting capacitor inserted {{in series with}} the startup winding, creating an LC circuit which produces a greater phase shift (and so, a much greater starting torque) than both <b>split-phase</b> and shaded pole motors.|$|E

50|$|Both {{three-phase}} {{and single}} <b>split-phase</b> {{power can be}} supplied from a single transformer bank.|$|E
50|$|Current {{practice}} {{is to give}} separate services for single-phase and three-phase loads, e.g., 120 V <b>split-phase</b> (lighting etc.) and 240 V to 600 V three-phase (for large motors). However, many jurisdictions forbid more than one class for a premises' service, and the choice may come down to 120/240 <b>split-phase,</b> 208 single-phase or three-phase (delta), 120/208 three-phase (wye), or 277/480 three-phase (wye) (or 347/600 three-phase (wye) in Canada).|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} basic types of {{competing}} small induction motors: single-phase, <b>split-phase</b> and shaded-pole types and small polyphase motors.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Split-phase</b> {{electric}} power is used when three-phase {{power is not}} available and allows double the normal utilization voltage to be supplied for high-power loads.|$|E
50|$|In some {{countries}} such as the United States, single phase is commonly divided in half to create <b>split-phase</b> electric power for household appliances and lighting.|$|E
50|$|In a {{single-phase}} <b>split-phase</b> motor, reversal {{is achieved}} by changing {{the connection between the}} primary winding and the start circuit. Some single-phase <b>split-phase</b> motors that are designed for specific applications may have the connection between the primary winding and the start circuit connected internally so that the rotation cannot be changed. Also, single-phase shaded-pole motors have a fixed rotation, and the direction cannot be changed except by disassembly of the motor and reversing the stator to face opposite relative to the original rotor direction.|$|E

50|$|A {{resistance}} {{start motor}} is a <b>split-phase</b> induction motor with a starter inserted {{in series with}} the startup winding, creating reactance. This added starter provides assistance in the starting and initial direction of rotation.|$|E
50|$|In Sweden <b>split-phase</b> {{electric}} power {{is also used}} on some railways. The center tap is grounded, one pole is fed with an overhead wire section, while the other wire is used for another section.|$|E
50|$|Another common {{single-phase}} AC motor is the <b>split-phase</b> induction motor, {{commonly used}} in major appliances such as air conditioners and clothes dryers. Compared to the shaded pole motor, these motors provide much greater starting torque.|$|E
50|$|While {{the above}} {{discussion}} focuses on preventing noise from getting in (e.g. into a microphone cable) the same star-quad quadrupole configuration {{is useful for}} audio speaker cable, for <b>split-phase</b> electric power wiring, and even for open-wire star quad transmission line.|$|E
50|$|A {{polyphase}} system must provide a defined direction of phase rotation, so mirror image voltages do not count towards the phase order. A 3-wire system with two phase conductors 180 degrees apart is still only single phase. Such systems are sometimes described as <b>split-phase.</b>|$|E
50|$|For each phase, {{power is}} fed along a busbar. In <b>split-phase</b> panels, {{separate}} busbars are fed {{directly from the}} incomer, which allows RCDs {{to be used to}} protect groups of circuits. Alternatively RCBOs may be used to provide both overcurrent and residual-current protection to single circuits.|$|E
50|$|NEMA 6 devices, while {{specified}} as 250 V, may be {{used for}} either 208 or 240 V circuits, generally depending on whether the building has a three-phase or <b>split-phase</b> power supply, respectively. The NEMA 6-20R or 6-30R found in many hotel rooms is typically supplied with three-phase 208 V.|$|E
50|$|Some tampers {{bypass the}} meter, wholly or in part. Safe tampers {{of this type}} {{normally}} increase the neutral current at the meter. Most <b>split-phase</b> residential meters in the United States are unable to detect neutral currents. However, modern tamper-resistant meters can detect and bill it at standard rates.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the Americas use 60 Hz AC, the 120/240 volt {{split phase}} system {{domestically}} and three phase for larger installations. North American transforms usually power homes at 240 volts, similar to Europe's 230 volts. It is the <b>split-phase</b> that allows use of 120 volts in the home.|$|E
50|$|A <b>split-phase</b> or {{single-phase}} three-wire {{system is}} a type of single-phase electric power distribution. It is the AC equivalent of the original Edison three-wire direct-current system. Its primary advantage is that it saves conductor material over a single-ended single-phase system, while only requiring single phase on the supply side of the distribution transformer.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A 240/120 V <b>split-phase</b> service drop {{providing}} {{power to}} a residence in USA. The three wires from the utility pole enter through a weatherhead (top) into a vertical conduit, which conducts them to the electric meter (bottom). From there they pass through {{the wall of the}} house to the electric panel inside.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, {{three-phase}} 230/400 V is {{most commonly}} used. However, 230/460 V, three-wire, single-phase systems {{are used to}} run farms and small groups of houses when only one (or sometimes two) of the three-phase high-voltage conductors are available. A <b>split-phase</b> final step-down transformer is often used, with the centre-tap earthed and the two halves usually supplying different buildings.|$|E
5000|$|At {{periodically}} spaced Paralleling Stations {{within each}} electrical section the tracks' catenary wires are connected together {{to one side}} of an autotransformer and the feeder wires are connected together {{to the other side of}} the autotransformer. The autotransformer center-tap is connected to the grounded running rails that return the current from the locomotives. The paralleling stations thus reduce voltage drops by feeding a locomotive from both directions along its contact wire and spreading the load across all the contact and feed wires of a multitrack system. The <b>split-phase</b> arrangement also gains the increased efficiency of operating at 50 kV while the highest voltage with respect to ground remains only 25 kV. (The same <b>split-phase</b> method is used in North American homes to supply high power loads such as air conditioners with the efficiency of a 240 V supply while retaining the safety advantages of a 120 V supply.) ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of modern North American <b>split-phase</b> power, the supply wires from two {{opposite}} single-phase circuit breakers are used to supply 240 V AC for high power devices. In modern circuits, these two wires are grouped together, and for each 240 V device a dedicated circuit is installed, usually with the two circuit breakers ganged together to operate simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Some higher-end {{units have}} an {{automatic}} reversing jam clearing feature. By using a slightly more-complicated centrifugal starting switch, the <b>split-phase</b> motor rotates {{in the opposite}} direction from the previous run each time it is started. This can clear minor jams, but is claimed to be unnecessary by some manufacturers: Since the late 1970s most disposal units have swivel impellers which make reversing unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|A {{capacitor}} with {{a relatively}} low capacitance, and relatively high voltage rating, is connected in series with the start winding and remains in the circuit during the entire run cycle. Like other <b>split-phase</b> motors, the main winding is used with a smaller start winding, and rotation is changed by reversing {{the connection between the}} main winding and the start circuit. There are significant differences, however; the use of a speed sensitive centrifugal switch requires that other <b>split-phase</b> motors must operate at, or very close to, full speed. PSC motors may operate within a wide range of speeds, much lower than the motor's electrical speed. Also, for applications like automatic door openers that require the motor to reverse rotation often, the use of a mechanism requires that a motor must slow to a near stop before contact with the start winding is re-established. The 'permanent' connection to the capacitor in a PSC motor means that changing rotation is instantaneous.|$|E
50|$|Each row {{is fed from}} a {{different}} phase (A, B, and C below), to allow 2- or 3-pole common-trip breakers to have one pole on each phase. In North America, {{it is common to}} wire large permanently installed equipment line-to-line. This takes two slots in the panel (two-pole) and gives a voltage of 240 V for <b>split-phase</b> electric power, or 208 V for three-phase power.|$|E
50|$|NEMA 10 {{devices are}} a curious throwback {{to an earlier}} time. They are {{classified}} as 125/250 V non-grounding, yet they are usually used {{in a manner that}} effectively grounds the appliance, albeit not {{in a manner consistent with}} most modern practice. They provide a neutral pin and two phase pins (X & Y) which are used for the two phases of a <b>split-phase</b> source.|$|E
50|$|All NEMA 14 devices offer two hots, a neutral, and a ground, {{allowing}} for both 120 and 240 V when supplied by <b>split-phase</b> power, or 120 and 208 V if the supply is three-phase. The 14-30 has {{a rating of}} 30 A, and an L-shaped neutral blade. The 14-50 has a rating of 50 A, and a straight neutral blade sized {{so that it does}} not mate with 14-30 connectors.|$|E
50|$|Amtrak's 60 Hz {{traction}} power {{system in the}} Northeast Corridor between New York and Boston also uses <b>split-phase</b> power distribution. Two separate wires are run along the track, the contact wire for the locomotive and an electrically separate feeder wire. Each wire is fed with 25 kV with respect to ground, with 50 kV between them. Autotransformers along the track balance the loads between the contact and feeder wires, reducing resistive losses.|$|E
5000|$|Neutral wire is {{the return}} {{conductor}} of a circuit; in building wiring systems, the neutral wire {{is connected to}} earth ground at least at one point. North American standards state that the neutral is neither switched nor fused except in very narrowly defined circumstances. The neutral {{is connected to the}} center tap of the power company transformer of a <b>split-phase</b> system, or the center of the wye connection of a polyphase power system.|$|E
