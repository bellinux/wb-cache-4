5000|$|Newton, born in Barrow-in-Furness {{when the}} town was still Lancashire, England grew up with boats and {{eventually}} became a welder in the towns shipyards. He said that because he was small, he was always the one [...] "picked out to weld the <b>inside</b> of the <b>rudders</b> and masts and other nasty places were no other person could reach." ...|$|R
50|$|In January 1955 the F-86D {{began to}} replace the F-86Fs, which were sent to NATO air forces. The squadron's tail {{markings}} changed with the F-86Ds having two or three horizontal red chevrons starting {{at the base of}} the rudder, with the chevron point touching the vertical fin's leading edge and angling towards the upper trailing edge of the <b>rudder.</b> <b>Inside</b> the rearmost chevron was a solid blue triangle.|$|R
50|$|Deck B (steerage): has 23 D-category cabins: 13 outside cabins (5 to port, 8 to <b>starboard)</b> and 10 <b>inside</b> cabins with 2 - 4 {{beds and}} a sink (WC / shower on the floor). Deck B also has 20 outside Category A cabins - 6-8m²: (12 to port, 8 to starboard). These rooms {{also have a}} {{bathroom}} with toilet and shower. Additionally, there are 7 inside cabins of Category I - 6-10m² with a bathroom with toilet and shower.|$|R
25|$|On {{the tenth}} {{anniversary of the}} International Space Station, Stefanyshyn-Piper and Kimbrough {{successfully}} conducted the mission's second spacewalk. The EVA was 6 hours and 45 minutes in duration, and all tasks were accomplished without complications. Two crew equipment carts were relocated {{in preparation for the}} arrival of the final set of solar arrays, the station's robotic arm was lubricated, and the work on the <b>starboard</b> SARJ continued. <b>Inside</b> the station, crewmembers continued to transfer cargo from Leonardo to the station, items to be returned to Earth into the MPLM, and continued the activation of the Water Recovery System.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{development}} of an autopilot system for leisure Yacht based on NMEA 2000 network and android platform. The developed system can operate both for manual steering and automatic navigation mode. In automatic steering mode, after manipulation of commands which are NMEA 0183 sentences by android platform, our system translates and sends the packets through NMEA 2000 network and the controller which is connected to NMEA 2000 network receives the commands and controls the boat?셲 rudder system automatically. The automatic steering mode will be achieved by cooperation of two controllersone for controlling the rudder system, and another for controlling the vessel?셲 heading. For this reason we have developed a PID controller with an adjustable dead-band gain and a supervisory controller inside dead-band area for the rudder system and a proportional controller to control the heading angle. The reason of using supervisory controller <b>inside</b> <b>rudder</b> controller?셲 dead-band block is to eliminate the steady-state error which occurs after applying dead-band block to the controller. This supervisory controller is an integral controller which specifically supervises the rudder?셲 behavior inside the dead-band area. In this study at the first stage we simulated our system in computer, and examined the proposed method?셲 feasibility. Next step was implementing the system on a real hydraulic steering model developed by us {{and at the end}} we finished the examination by implementing it on a real boat and doing test navigation.

5000|$|At 7:25 p.m. local time, the Hindenburg {{caught fire}} and quickly became engulfed in flames. Eyewitness {{statements}} disagree {{as to where}} the fire initially broke out; several witnesses {{on the port side}} saw yellow-red flames first jump forward of the top fin near the ventilation shaft of cells 4 and 5. Other witnesses on the port side noted the fire actually began just ahead of the horizontal port fin, only then followed by flames in front of the upper fin. One, with views of the starboard side, saw flames beginning lower and farther aft, near cell 1 behind the <b>rudders.</b> <b>Inside</b> the airship, helmsman Helmut Lau, who was stationed in the lower fin, testified hearing a muffled detonation and looked up to see a bright reflection on the front bulkhead of gas cell 4, which [...] "suddenly disappeared by the heat". As other gas cells started to catch fire, the fire spread more to the starboard side and the ship dropped rapidly. Although there were cameramen from four newsreel teams and at least one spectator known to be filming the landing, as well as numerous photographers at the scene, no known footage or photograph exists of the moment the fire started.|$|R
2500|$|The Skycar I {{was first}} {{displayed}} at the spring 1931 Detroit Show. The aircraft was a two-seat high-wing monoplane, accommodating the occupants in tandem layout. It had an all-metal steel-tube frame covered with corrugated metal skin. Centre-line nose and tail-wheels plus a standard landing gear were fitted. The rear fuselage was constructed from an open framework carrying a single fin and <b>rudder,</b> <b>inside</b> which was located the rear pusher engine. The Sky Car was displayed with a Moorhouse engine (Alfred Moorhouse of Detroit, assignor to Packard Motor Car Company). Fuel was carried in two tanks in the leading portion of the central section of the engine housing, from where it was fed by gravity to the engine. At a later date the aircraft was fitted with twin booms carrying the single fin and rudder (see photo of preserved aircraft). The aircraft featured balanced pivoting outboard wingtips rather than ailerons. Stout attempted to design a simple aircraft that would have controls similar to early model Fords including the ignition switch and the starter button. Stout planned to build the Sky Car (i.e. its original name was [...] "Sky Car" [...] but various newspaper and magazine articles spelled it [...] "Skycar") [...] and sell it {{at the price of}} a moderately priced car (approximately $2000) if mass-produced in numbers.|$|R
