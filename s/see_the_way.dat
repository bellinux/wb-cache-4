A secondary purpose is to illuminate reflective materials such as cat's eyes and traffic signs. A third purpose may be to illuminate the roadway so that the rider can <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> ahead. Serving the latter purposes require much more luminous flux and thus more power.|$|E

[...] The Torchwood writers conceived John as a classical nemesis for Captain Jack, with Chibnall commenting, [...] "In seeing John you <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Jack could have gone, and probably did, for a little while." [...] James Marsters further discussed ways in which John is a doppelgänger or foil to Captain Jack: both are pansexual time travellers, with their key difference being that John never reformed. The character exaggerates many of Jack's qualities, for example displaying zoophilic attraction to non-humanoids such as poodles, in addition to men and women. John and Jack's intentional similarities extend to their penchant for period war clothing: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Rush" [...] is {{a country}} song written by Blu Sanders, Natalie Hemby and Lindsay Dawn Chapman, and {{produced}} by Dann Huff. It features American country singer-songwriter Vince Gill. The song {{is set in a}} [...] "drowsy, take-it-easy beat" [...] which is composed of a layer of Clarkson's and Gill's soulful harmonies. The song begins with a breezy soft-rock tune. In the first verse, Clarkson sings [...] "I <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> you’re looking at me / Baby know I’m feeling it too / We can just light up every candle / Move from room to room" [...] which was ensued by the sound of Gill's guitar. As the song launches into the chorus, both Clarkson and Gill are heard singing [...] "Stopping every minute just because you're in it/Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me/It's how it's supposed to be", a vocal chorus deemed as [...] "slightly awkward" [...] by Will Hermes of Rolling Stone. In the final chorus, the pair pauses before the key changes at minute three.|$|E

Barrowman believes that Jack does harbour romantic feelings toward the Doctor, but [...] "would never take that beyond infatuation" [...] and [...] "would never let the Doctor know". Barrowman claims that Jack also [...] "" [...] fellow companion Martha Jones, admiring her [...] "tenacity" [...] and willingness to [...] "spat with him", and describes Jack's love for Toshiko and Owen as [...] "fatherly", stating [...] "He was guiding them. That's {{why it was so}} devastating for him to lose them." [...] The second series of Torchwood also introduced Jack's ex-lover, Captain John. Head writer Chris Chibnall introduced John to act as a [...] "proper nemesis, somebody to really test , to push him, and to reveal something about Jack's character". In the use of Captain John as a literary foil, Chibnall comments [...] "you <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Jack could have gone, and probably did, for a little while" [...] which underlines how [...] "Jack, in his experiences with the Doctor and Torchwood, made a very conscious decision to move away from that behaviour." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Denial" [...] is a midtempo Europop {{song with}} {{elements}} of soft rock. Its instrumentation {{is provided by}} a guitar, a keyboard, drums and synthesizers. The song contains {{a sample of the}} bass hook from [...] "Standing in the Way of Control" [...] by The Gossip. Kim Dawson of the Daily Star compared the song's bassline to that featured in [...] "One Minute", a song from Kelly Clarkson's album My December. The opening of [...] "Denial" [...] is evocative of David Bowie's song [...] "Fashion", although it soon transitions into the sound of songs performed by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue. [...] "Denial" [...] is composed of soft rock staccato verses, which are proceeded by a melancholic and harmonious pop chorus. Digital Spy's Nick Levine commented upon the song's compositional transition, writing: [...] "'Denial' rides its elastic bassline to a transcendent, melodically-inspired chorus". The group's harmonies are backed by warm synthesizers and 1980s soft rock music. The song contains a solo middle eight performed by group member Heidi Range, and is opened with the line [...] "I <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the wind blows like open minds for us". [...] "Denial" [...] explores themes of unrequited love, as noted by Peter Murphy from Hot Press.|$|E
500|$|During {{the casting}} process, Shannon was {{compared}} to Paris Hilton, and Lost producer Damon Lindelof described her as a [...] "bitch. She is like a typical spoiled daddy's girl who gets whatever she wants and is not responsible to the slightest bit." [...] Eirik Knutzen of The Repository found Shannon to be [...] "a self-centered twit," [...] and she was also called a [...] "spoiled daddy's girl." [...] Boone describes her as a [...] "self-centered little bitch." [...] On her first night on the Island, Shannon is confident they will be rescued, refusing to help the others organize the luggage. She does not care Rose (L. Scott Caldwell) has lost her husband, and spends {{much of her time}} sunbathing. She manipulates Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) into catching a fish for her, after which Boone apologizes on behalf of Shannon for [...] "using this poor guy like [...] use everyone else." [...] In [...] "Whatever the Case May Be," [...] Boone says to Shannon, [...] "Don't you <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they look at us around here? They don't take us seriously. We're a joke.

500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Give Me Your Eyes" [...] was filmed over {{the night of}} July 23–24, 2008 at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport in Birmingham, Alabama after most flights had landed for the night. It was {{directed}} by the Erwin Brothers and premiered on the Gospel Music Channel on August 23, 2008. The video is mainly set in an airport as Brandon Heath walks among people, with interspersed shots of Heath sitting on steps and singing. The scenes of Heath sitting on stairs and in a chair were filmed in the older 1962 Birmingham Air Terminal which is adjacent to the current terminal and no longer used for passenger traffic. In {{the bridge of the}} song, a portion of the video is played backwards as he sings the lines [...] "I want a second glance/So give me a second chance/To <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> You see the people all alone". In the last chorus, a few of the previous scenes are replayed as Heath now helps with people's individual situations. In one of the early shots, a woman steps in front of an approaching car; it is replayed as Heath intervenes and stops her from being hit by the car. The video's airport scene included about 100 extras.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by critics who praised the collaboration between Rowland and Guetta. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said [...] "It {{looks as though}} they're going to be ruling the airwaves all over again... After she lulls us into {{a false sense of}} security ("I feel like the DJ is bodyguard / You <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he keeps me safe? / With the treble and the bass?"), the track plunges into a pounding electro-house chorus that quite literally orders us to the dance floor... The result isn't quite as fresh and inventive as some of Guetta's recent output – Kelis' [...] 'Acapella', for example – but it goes a long way towards recapturing some of last summer's magic." [...] The site's other reviewer, Nick Levine, agreed saying that the song [...] "thumps as persuasively as Muhammad Ali circa 1967." [...] Robert Daw of Idolator said [...] "if you think Ms. Kelly is taking the go-go boots off anytime soon, then you'd best go lean against the wall, flower. Rowland's Guetta-produced new single 'Commander' is pure strobe-light adrenaline rush... will appear on Kelly's as-yet-untitled third solo album... we're predicting a full on Rowland Renaissance!".

2500|$|Irving Hexham rejects Peretti's {{depiction}} of the New Age as confirming a negative stereotype. Hexham observes that Peretti's novels reflect the anxieties that many fundamentalist and evangelical Christians have about secular society, the mass media, {{the social sciences and}} tertiary education. He is also disturbed [...] "to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Frank Peretti has become a popular and oft-quoted authority on the New Age" [...] because [...] "his actual qualifications in religious matters are minimal" [...] ("The Evangelical Response to the New Age", p.157).|$|E

2500|$|Steinsaltzs' works aroused fierce {{opposition}} {{in parts of}} the Orthodox Jewish world, with many leading rabbis such as Elazar Shach, Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, and Eliezer Waldenberg harshly condemning his Talmud and other books. Waldenberg wrote that that when the Steinsaltz Talmud was brought before him, he was [...] "shocked" [...] to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which the Steinsaltz Talmud described the Patriarchs and Talmudic sages, as well as it's approach to the Oral Torah. Waldenberg further wrote that the Steinsaltz Talmud had the power to [...] "poision the souls" [...] of those who read it. Mordechai Gifter delivered a pointed lecture on the subject, criticizing Steinsaltz and his defenders in strong terms.|$|E
2500|$|Songs to Remember {{was finally}} {{released}} in September 1982. In several interviews {{at the time}} of the album's release, Gartside stated his dissatisfaction with Rough Trade's promotion of the record, hinting in one interview that [...] "there's still a lot of problems, as far as I'm concerned, fundamental matters of distribution and economics, promotion, marketing and a bias against their product at radio stations" [...] and in another he complained, [...] "I must say I've been badly disappointed the way RT have handled the past three singles.

Of Lexa possibly putting Clarke first instead of her own people, she said perhaps if [...] "Clarke was able to assimilate to their culture as well and become more of a right-hand man, then maybe I think Lexa could—then that would be a merger of two people."

2500|$|On July 29, 2007, Ichiro {{collected}} his 1,500th U.S. hit, {{the third}} fastest {{to reach the}} MLB milestone behind Al Simmons and George Sisler. Ichiro had 213 hits in 2008, his eighth straight 200-hit season. This tied the 107-year-old record set by Wee Willie Keeler. Typically, Ichiro was among baseball's leaders in reaching base on an error (14 times in 2008, {{more than any other}} batter in the AL), and in infield hits (his 56 were the most in the majors). Ichiro has amassed more than 450 infield hits in his U.S. career. Detroit third baseman Brandon Inge told the New York Times, [...] "I wish you could put a camera at third base to see how he hits the ball and <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it deceives you. You can call some guys’ infield hits cheap, but not his. He has amazing technique." [...] In May 2008, Ichiro stole two bases, giving him a career total of 292, surpassing the previous Seattle Mariners team record of 290 set by second baseman Julio Cruz. Cruz, who now does Spanish-language broadcasts of Mariners games, was watching from the broadcast booth as Ichiro broke his record.|$|E

[...] In his review for The Hollywood Reporter, Miles Beller wrote, [...] "Scripted by Karl Schaefer and José Rivera with smart, sharp insights; slyly directed by feature film helmsman Joe Dante; and given edgy life by the show's winning cast, Eerie, Indiana shapes up {{as one of the}} fall season's standouts, a newcomer that has the fresh, bracing look of Edward Scissorhands and scores as a clever, wry presentation well worth watching." [...] In his review for the Orange County Register, Ray Richmond wrote, [...] "It's the kind of knowingly hip series with equally strong appeal for both kids and adults, the kind that preteens will watch and discuss." [...] USA Today described the show as [...] "Stephen King by way of The Simpsons", and Matt Roush wrote, [...] "Eerie recalls Edward Scissorhands and even – heaven help it – David Lynch in its garish nightmare-comedy depiction of the lurid and silly horrors that lurk beneath suburban conformity." [...] In his review for the Washington Times, David Klinghoffer wrote, [...] "Everything about the pilot exceeds the normal minimal expectations of TV. Mr. Dante directs as if he were making a movie, and a good one. In a departure from usual TV operating procedures, he sometimes actually has more than one thing going on on screen at the same time!" ...|$|E
