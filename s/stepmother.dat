[...] Jones re-wrote the lyrics and fronted the band for about 2 months, doing double duty with his main band The <b>Stepmothers.</b> He then dropped out because, as he put it: [...] "The <b>Stepmothers</b> were his first love, and, frankly, the drive between Claremont, where the <b>Stepmothers</b> were based, and the Overkill rehearsal studio in South Bay was killing him." [...] There was also reportedly some friction between Posh Boy and SST about this arrangement, although the <b>Stepmothers</b> were quite friendly with the Black Flag tribe and Greg and Chuck jumped on stage with the band at <b>Stepmothers</b> gigs on more than one occasion.|$|R

40|$|<b>Stepmothers</b> have {{received}} a bad press over the centuries. They are the cruel replacement mothers of fairytales, women {{who may not have}} children themselves and whose relationship with their new offspring is hostile or neglectful. <b>Stepmothers</b> usurp another woman’s role, generally that of the idealised, biological mother who has died tragically and can never be replaced in her children’s hearts. This antithetical role plays out in folk narratives such as Hansel and Gretel, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella, which offer murderous <b>stepmothers</b> and absent fathers who are blind or indifferent to their children’s peril...|$|R

It is uncertain how he lost his sight, but it is generally agreed by most biographers of Johnson that he was blinded by his <b>stepmother</b> when he was seven years old, a claim that was first made by Johnson's purported widow Angeline Johnson. In her recollection, Willie's father had violently confronted his <b>stepmother</b> about her infidelity, and during the argument she splashed Willie with a caustic solution of lye water, permanently blinding him.
