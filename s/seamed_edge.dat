40|$|The use of hot-dip {{galvanized}} steel sheets as base material for laser brazing {{led to the}} formation of spatter and a wavy appearance of the seam. High-speed imaging revealed that spatter formation occurs mainly close to the <b>seam</b> <b>edges.</b> Thermography of the brazing process showed that the type of zinc coating affects the resulting temperature distribution and thereby changes the conditions for the zinc evaporation. Higher temperatures were observed at the <b>seam</b> <b>edges</b> on electro galvanized and phosphated substrates. The cross sections and the process analysis indicate that the zinc evaporation on electro galvanized substrates takes place prior to the wetting with the molten filler material. On the other hand a merely partial evaporation of the zinc coating and the accumulation of zinc at the <b>seam</b> <b>edges</b> takes place during the brazing of {{hot-dip galvanized}} substrates. The formation of spatter is caused by the zinc dissolution and the subsequent evaporation of the zinc rich alloy at the <b>seam</b> <b>edges.</b> The optical properties of the base material are considered to be a crucial factor for the temperature distribution and the resulting zinc evaporation. Brazing trials on hot-dip galvanized and phosphated substrates, which show a reflectance similar to electro galvanized and phosphated specimens, confirm this assumption, as no spatter formation at the <b>seam</b> <b>edge</b> was observed...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{properties}} and corrosion behaviour of welded seams {{have been investigated}} in dependence of welding conditions. X-ray microanalytical studies show an enhanced copper transition from the copper electrode wire to the seam surface following higher welding currents. The copper becomes alloyed to the residual tin at the seam surface. The copper transition has no disadvantages concerning the corrosion behaviour. Possible local cathodic actions lowering the corrosion resistance have not been observed. Welding conditions forming iron splashes at the <b>seam</b> <b>edge</b> enhance the iron corrosion. This requires an effective side seam protection. The oxide layers on welded seams have been characterized by point potential measurements. Welding conditions which lead to a reduced adhesion of oxide layers on the seam can be valuated...|$|R
50|$|Coverstitch {{is formed}} {{by two or}} more needles {{and one or two}} loopers. Like {{lockstitch}} and chainstitch, coverstitch can be formed anywhere on the material being sewn. One looper manipulates a thread below the material being sewn, forming a bottom cover stitch against the needle threads. An additional looper above the material can form a top cover stitch simultaneously. The needle threads form parallel rows, while the looper threads cross back and forth all the needle rows. Coverstitch is so-called because the grid of crossing needle and looper threads covers raw <b>seam</b> <b>edges,</b> much as the overlock stitch does. It is widely used in garment construction, particularly for attaching trims and flat seaming where the raw edges can be finished in the same operation as forming the seam.|$|R

40|$|The {{coordinate}} {{acquisition of}} curve seam in robotic laser welding is becoming very important {{due to its}} strict demands for high accuracy and high speed. The precision of the coordinates of curve seam is crucial to guarantee the welding quality. This paper presents an approach by using Ghosal&# 39;s algorithm based on orthogonal Zernike moments for acquiring the coordinates of welding seam which is sine wave in shape. Firstly, two <b>edges</b> of the <b>seam</b> are detected by the edge detection algorithm based on Zernike moments. Then, by using median algorithm, a new sine curve connected {{with a string of}} single-pixel can be generated from the two detected <b>seam</b> <b>edges.</b> Secondly, the sub-pixel level coordinates of the sine seam are extracted. In the end, experiments have been implemented and results show that the approach is feasible.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of seismic profiling along the sidewalls of two headings of a longwall in a coal-seam at a depth of about 850 and 870 metres in a coal mine in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, Poland. The seismic profiles were located in a zone of impact of the same overlying edge of the coal-seam located about 40 m above. This study was interesting from that point of view since there were no other geological and mining factors present which could disturb the impact of the coal <b>seam</b> <b>edge.</b> The profiling of refracted P-wave velocity changes was carried out according to the Dubinski method. This method is used for the assessment of relative stress in a coal seam in the side wall of the excavation. The results obtained on both seismic profiles are very similar, which demonstrates the small impact of the overlying edge of the coal seam in both headings of a longwall. It should be emphasised that at greater exploitation depths, the calculated reference velocity is less reliable than the measured reference velocity. Presumably, the method of calculating seismic anomaly requires updating under such conditions, but additional evidence should be collected...|$|R

50|$|Modern museum dioramas {{may be seen}} in {{most major}} natural history museums. Typically, these {{displays}} use a tilted plane to represent what would otherwise be a level surface, incorporate a painted background of distant objects, and often employ false perspective, carefully modifying the scale of objects placed on the plane to reinforce the illusion through depth perception in which objects of identical real-world size placed farther from the observer appear smaller than those closer. Often the distant painted background or sky will be painted upon a continuous curved surface so that the viewer is not distracted by corners, <b>seams,</b> or <b>edges.</b> All of these techniques are means of presenting a realistic view of a large scene in a compact space.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the materiality of fashion and the role it plays in the continuous making of personal and social subjectivities, through the author’s own experience of making seamless woven garments. Psychoanalyst Didier Anzieu’s influential notion of ‘the Skin Ego’ theorizes the initial formation of human subjectivity based on the tactile interaction between the mothering environment and the baby. As a garment maker, the author analyses the woven surface or garment as {{the extension of the}} Skin Ego, and inquires into the ways that the ‘separation’ from the earliest relationship and the unending attempt to repair this ‘cut’, might become figured in the ambiguity that is found in the <b>seams</b> and <b>edges</b> of garments.

50|$|Human uses of {{serration}} have copied, {{and gone}} beyond, {{those found in}} nature. For example, the teeth on a saw or other serrated blade serves a similar cutting or scraping purpose as the serration of an animal tooth. Tailors use pinking shears to cut cloth with a serrated edge, which, somewhat counterintuitively, reduces fraying by reducing {{the average length of}} a thread that may be pulled from the edge. A type of serration is also found in airframe shapes used in certain stealth aircraft, which use the jaggedness of the serrated edge to deflect radar signals from <b>seams</b> and <b>edges</b> where a straight, non-serrated edge would reflect radar signals back to the source. Screw threads show serration in profile, although they are usually shown in abbreviated or symbolic fashion on mechanical drawings to save time and ink. Brogue shoes are made with serrated edges on the leather pieces, for no known purpose at all other than style. The step clamp and step block assembly in metalworking adopt serration for the purpose of applying clamping pressure from an adjustable position.|$|R

40|$|Second surface silver microsheet glass {{concentrators}} {{are being}} developed for potential use in future solar dynamic space power systems. Traditional concentrators are aluminum honeycomb sandwich composites with either aluminum or graphite epoxy face sheets, where a reflective aluminum layer is deposited onto an organic leveling layer on the face sheet. To protect the underlying layers, a SiO 2 layer is applied {{on top of the}} aluminum reflective layer. These concentrators may be vulnerable to atomic oxygen degradation due to possible atomic oxygen attack of the organic layers at defect sites in the protective and reflective coatings. A second surface microsheet glass concentrator would be inherently more atomic oxygen durable than these first surface concentrators. In addition, a second surface microsheet glass concentrator design provides a smooth optical surface and allows for silver {{to be used as a}} reflective layer, which would improve the reflectivity of the concentrator and the performance of the system. A potential threat to the performance of second surface microsheet glass concentrators is atomic oxygen attack of the underlying silver at <b>seams</b> and <b>edges</b> or at micrometeoroid and debris (MMD) impacts sites. Second surface silver microsheet glass concentrator samples were fabricated and tested for atomic oxygen durability. The samples were iteratively exposed to an atomic oxygen environment in a plasma asher. Samples were evaluated for potential degradation at fabrication seams, simulated MMD impact sites, and edges. Optical microscopy was used to evaluate atomic oxygen degradation. Reflectance was obtained for an impacted sample prior to and after atomic oxygen exposure. After an initial atomic oxygen exposure to an effective fluence of approx. 1 x 10 (exp 21) atoms/cm(exp 2), oxidation of the silver at defect sites and edges was observed. Exposure to an additional approx. 1 x 10 (exp 21) atoms/cm(exp 2) caused no observed increase in oxidation. Oxidation at an impact site caused negligible changes in reflectance. In all cases oxidation was found to be confined to the vicinity of the <b>seams,</b> impact sites, <b>edges</b> or defect sites.
