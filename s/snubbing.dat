5|$|Despite the club's relegation to League One {{and another}} spell in administration, Wetherall {{turned down a}} move away from Bradford City after <b>snubbing</b> Coventry City during the 2004 summer. In October 2004, Wetherall and fellow veteran player Dean Windass both signed year's {{extensions}} to their contracts, with Wetherall's keeping him at Bradford {{until the end of}} the 2007–08 season. He also put his injury problems to one side for the 2004–05 season and missed just one league game – a 1–1 draw with Walsall in February when he was ruled out because of suspension ending his run of 42 consecutive games. Bradford manager Colin Todd had identified Wetherall as a key player for the season, but despite scoring four goals and striker Windass' 27 goals earning him the league's top scorer's crown, Bradford could only finish 11th.|$|E

25|$|On horse-drawn and mule-drawn canals, <b>snubbing</b> posts {{were used}} to slow or stop a boat in the lock. A 200-ton boat moving at a few miles an hour could destroy the lock gate. To prevent this, a rope was wound around the <b>snubbing</b> post as the boat entered the lock. Pulling on the rope slowed the boat, due to the {{friction}} of the rope against the post. A rope 2½ inches (6.3cm) in diameter and about 60 feet (18 meters) long was typically used on the Erie Canal to snub a boat in a lock.|$|E
5000|$|Coxeter's <b>snub</b> {{terminology}} {{is slightly}} different, meaning an alternated truncation, deriving the <b>snub</b> cube as a <b>snub</b> cuboctahedron, and the <b>snub</b> dodecahedron as a <b>snub</b> icosidodecahedron. This definition {{is used in}} the naming two Johnson solids: <b>snub</b> disphenoid, and <b>snub</b> square antiprism, as well as higher dimensional polytopes such as the 4-dimensional <b>snub</b> 24-cell, [...] or s{3,4,3}.|$|R
50|$|Two Johnson solids are <b>snub</b> polyhedra: the <b>snub</b> disphenoid and the <b>snub</b> square antiprism. Neither is chiral.|$|R

25|$|The chief {{remaining}} {{structure is}} a wood headframe on Cable Mountain. The structures {{at the bottom}} of the cables consisted of <b>snubbing</b> posts to separate the cables. Nothing remains of the lower end of the draw works.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, former Cumann na nGaedheal {{minister}} Ernest Blythe accused Aiken of rudely <b>snubbing</b> him in public throughout his political career. He said that, {{because of his}} support for the Treaty and Aiken's opposition, Aiken would pointedly turn his back on him whenever they came into contact.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Department of Labor {{stated that}} only the {{limitations}} of physical strength prevented the children from performing all operations connected with handling boats. Otho Swain reported he saw a ten-year-old girl put a boat through a lock (i.e. <b>snubbing</b> the boat so it would stop), {{but that would have}} been a child who grew up on the canal.|$|E
50|$|In the {{pictures}} of the <b>snub</b> derivation (showing a distorted <b>snub</b> polyhedron, topologically identical to the uniform version, arrived at from geometrically alternating the parent uniform omnitruncated polyhedron) where green is not present, the faces derived from alternation are coloured red and yellow, while the <b>snub</b> triangles are blue. Where green is present (only for the <b>snub</b> icosidodecadodecahedron and great <b>snub</b> dodecicosidodecahedron), the faces derived from alternation are red, yellow, and blue, while the <b>snub</b> triangles are green.|$|R
50|$|The <b>snub</b> rhombicuboctahedron is a polyhedron, {{constructed}} as a truncated rhombicuboctahedron. It has 74 faces: 18 squares, and 56 triangles. It {{can also be}} called the Conway <b>snub</b> cuboctahedron in but will {{be confused with the}} Coxeter <b>snub</b> cuboctahedron, the <b>snub</b> cube.|$|R
50|$|The icosahedron, as {{a uniform}} <b>snub</b> tetrahedron, {{is similar to}} these snub-pair {{compound}}s: compound of two <b>snub</b> cubes and compound of two <b>snub</b> dodecahedra.|$|R
25|$|When {{the office}} of Attorney General fell vacant in 1594, Lord Essex's {{influence}} {{was not enough to}} secure the position for Bacon and it was given to Sir Edward Coke. Likewise, Bacon failed to secure the lesser office of Solicitor General in 1595, the Queen pointedly <b>snubbing</b> him by appointing Sir Thomas Fleming instead. To console him for these disappointments, Essex presented him with a property at Twickenham, which Bacon subsequently sold for £1,800.|$|E
25|$|Each pneumofathometer gauge has an {{overpressure}} valve {{to protect it}} against gas supply at higher pressure than {{it is designed to}} take. This is essential as the main supply pressure is significantly higher than the maximum depth pressure on the pneumo gauge. There is also often a <b>snubbing</b> valve or orifice between the pneumo line and the gauge to restrict flow into the gauge and ensure that the {{overpressure valve}} can adequately relieve the pressure.|$|E
25|$|Mobutu's Zaire {{maintained}} {{good relations}} with Western powers. Belgium had the largest investments in the country (worth $750 million–$1 billion), followed by the United States ($200 million) and France ($20 million). Franco-Zairian relations were nevertheless improving, and the Zaire government had recently been <b>snubbing</b> Belgium in favor of France—awarding the country a $500 million telecommunications contract in 1975. This contract, negotiated by French President Giscard d'Estaing, went to Thomson-CSF International with finances from the Banque Française du Commerce Extérieur—both institutions headed by members of d'Estaing's family. When Mobutu asked for international assistance, it was France under d'Estaing that organized the military response.|$|E
25|$|Here {{again the}} <b>snub</b> 24-cell, with the {{symmetry}} group + this time, represents an alternated truncation of the truncated 24-cell creating 96 new tetrahedra {{at the position}} of the deleted vertices. In contrast to its appearance within former groups as partly <b>snubbed</b> 4-polytope, only within this symmetry group it has the full analogy to the Kepler <b>snubs,</b> i.e. the <b>snub</b> cube and the <b>snub</b> dodecahedron.|$|R
50|$|Other semi-operators can {{be defined}} using the H operator. Conway calls Coxeter's <b>Snub</b> {{operation}} S, a semi-snub, defined as Ht. Conway's <b>snub</b> operator s is defined as SR. For example, SRC is a <b>snub</b> cube, sr{4,3}. Coxeter's <b>snub</b> octahedron, s{3,4} {{can be defined}} as SO, a pyritohedral symmetry construction of the regular icosahedron. It also is consistent with the Johnson solid <b>snub</b> square antiprism as SA4.|$|R

25|$|Power {{capacitors}} can be {{used for}} a wide variety of applications, even where extremely non-sinusoidal voltages and pulsed currents are present. Both AC and DC capacitors are available. AC capacitors serve as damping or <b>snubbing</b> capacitors when connected in series with a resistor, and are also specified for the damping of undesirable voltage spikes caused by the so-called charge carrier storage effect during switching of power semiconductors. In addition, AC capacitors are used in low-detuned or close-tuned filter circuits for filtering or absorbing harmonics. As pulse discharge capacitors, they are useful in applications with reversing voltages, such as in magnetizing equipment.|$|E
25|$|Paramount {{attempted}} {{to use the}} coming of sound films to pressure the actress, but she called the studio's bluff. It was not until 30 years later that this rebellious move would come {{to be seen as}} arguably the most savvy of her career, securing her immortality as a silent film legend and independent spirit. Unfortunately, while her initial <b>snubbing</b> of Paramount alone would not have finished her in Hollywood altogether, her refusal after returning from Germany to come back to Paramount for sound retakes of The Canary Murder Case (1929) irrevocably placed her on an unofficial blacklist. Actress Margaret Livingston was hired to dub Brooks's voice for the film, as the studio claimed that Brooks' voice was unsuitable for sound pictures.|$|E
25|$|Apart from England, Pakistan is {{the only}} other top-eight Test-playing nation not to be {{represented}} in the tournament. In February 2010, Ijaz Butt, {{the chairman of the}} Pakistan Cricket Board, had reportedly refused participation in the tournament due to the <b>snubbing</b> of Pakistani cricketers in the 2010 Indian Premier League player auction. The auction resulted in none of them being bought for the league. Butt later stated his comments were misunderstood, but the Champions League administrators had already decided to leave out Pakistan due to Butt's statements. Champions League officials have made contradicting statements as to whether a Pakistan team would have been considered regardless of Butt's statement. Pakistan was also absent from the previous edition due to the deterioration of relations between host nation India and Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|In August 1997, Liverpool, {{having been}} unable to agree a new {{contract}} with McManaman and fearing that the player might leave on a Bosman free transfer, accepted a £12million bid for the player from Barcelona. The deal subsequently fell apart amidst recriminations about the player's remuneration demands and Barcelona's motives for the bid, being in negotiation with Rivaldo {{at the same time}} and <b>snubbing</b> McManaman when he travelled to Spain to meet them. By the end of the saga, the whole fiasco seemed to be a non-affair, with Barcelona signing Rivaldo after Sir Bobby Robson intervened and told Louis van Gaal that McManaman was a cosmetic player who would not score 18 goals a season for Barcelona, while McManaman himself stated that he had no desire to leave Liverpool and with two years left on his contract was simply not in any rush to sign a new one. A subsequent bid of £11million from Juventus in November of the same year was rejected by both club and player.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as the}} Blonds {{dropped the}} titles, the team was again {{temporarily}} split up. Austin and Pillman both claimed that it was for political reasons. Austin was given a singles push challenging Dustin Rhodes for the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. After Pillman finally recovered, he and Austin had a few more matches together taking on teams such as Marcus Alexander Bagwell and 2 Cold Scorpio, Scorpio and Ron Simmons, Simmons and Ice Train, and jobber tag team Frankie Rowe and Jimmy Rogers. The Blonds also confronted The Nasty Boys and Missy Hyatt during an interview after The Nasty Boys had won the titles from Anderson and Roma. The Blonds last match as a team {{took place on the}} October 30, 1993 episode of Saturday Night. After the Blonds had defeated a jobber tag team, Col. Rob Parker (who had just become Austin's new manager) came to ringside to congratulate Austin (and not Pillman) on winning the match. Pillman took exception to Parker <b>snubbing</b> him. Parker brought up Pillman's bad leg and said if he was a race horse, he would put him down. Pillman attacked Parker, which in turn led to Austin attacking and turning on Pillman, turning Pillman face and the Blonds broke up for the third and final time.|$|E

50|$|Among the <b>snub</b> polyhedra that {{cannot be}} {{otherwise}} generated, only the pentagonal antiprism, pentagrammic antiprism, pentagrammic crossed-antiprism, small <b>snub</b> icosicosidodecahedron and small retrosnub icosicosidodecahedron {{are known to}} occur in any non-prismatic uniform 4-polytope. The tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron, and great icosahedron appear commonly in non-prismatic uniform 4-polytopes, but not in their <b>snub</b> constructions. Every <b>snub</b> polyhedron however can appear in the polyhedral prism based on them.|$|R
50|$|In geometry, a <b>snub</b> is an {{operation}} {{applied to a}} polyhedron. The term originates from Kepler's names of two Archimedean solids, for the <b>snub</b> cube (cubus simus) and <b>snub</b> dodecahedron (dodecaedron simum). In general, <b>snubs</b> have chiral symmetry with two forms, with clockwise or counterclockwise orientations. By Kepler's names, a <b>snub</b> {{can be seen as}} an expansion of a regular polyhedron, with the faces moved apart, and twists on their centers, adding new polygons centered on the original vertices, and pairs of triangles fitting between the original edges.|$|R
