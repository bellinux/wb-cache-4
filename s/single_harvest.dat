50|$|Thinopyrum intermedium {{is among}} the most {{productive}} forage species for the western United States. Because it heads relatively late, it can be grown effectively in mixture with alfalfa to increase its productivity, longevity, and forage quality. It regrows slowly after grazing or cutting, making it best suited to management with a <b>single</b> <b>harvest</b> per year. If multiple harvests are needed per year, other species will be more productive. If managed well, stands can persist for up to 50 years.|$|E

A new even-aged stand is {{obtained}} by planting, natural or advanced regeneration, or direct seeding. The opening size and dimensions created are generally large enough to limit significant microclimatic influence from the surrounding stand.

50|$|The name of {{this tree}} and fruit comes from the {{indigenous}} phrase y-mb-u, which means tree that gives drink. The productive cycle of this wild, spontaneously growing tree begins after ten years of growth. It bears fruit once a year and can produce up to 300 kilos of fruit in a <b>single</b> <b>harvest</b> when it reaches maturity. Due to its robust root system, a great network of tubers that can store liquid throughout the Sertão s dry season, the imbu tree can hold up to 3,000 liters of water during the dry months.|$|E

50|$|Garrafeira is {{an unusual}} and rare {{intermediate}} vintage-dated style of port made from the grapes of a <b>single</b> <b>harvest</b> that combines the oxidative maturation of years in wood with further reductive maturation in large glass demijohns. It is required by the IVDP that wines spend some time in wood, usually between three and six years, followed by at least a further eight years in glass, before bottling. In practice the times spent in glass are much longer. The style is most {{closely associated with the}} company Niepoort, although others do exist. Their dark green demijohns, affectionately known as bon-bons, hold approximately 11 L each. Some connoisseurs describe Garrafeira as having a slight taste of bacon, although many people will neither notice nor understand such a description; the reason being that, during the second phase of maturation, certain oils may precipitate, causing a film to form {{across the surface of the}} glass that can be tasted by those who are accustomed to the difference between Garrafeira and other forms of port.|$|E
50|$|It {{started in}} December 1851 {{when it rained}} tremendously for over a week with some gusty winds. The heavy downpour causes deluge on the rivers {{uprooting}} huge trees carrying them from {{the banks of the}} river to the plains. No official record of casualties existed. Another typhoon happened in May 1866 struck several towns including Alimodian. During its full strength a lightning struck the giant cross on the belfry of the new church toppling it to the ground. A strong earthquake jolted the church on June 29, 1869 a feast day of St. Peter and St. Paul and many pious devotees who flocked to the church at 7 am mass suffered broken limbs during a commotion. A big fire took place at around 1 pm April 25, 1877 and at least 17 houses made of bamboo and other light materials reduced to ashes while an old woman caught fire and left several families homeless. July and August 1877 were months ravaged with typhoon and severe flooding causing many trees to be uprooted. The heavy downpour in those months caused nature to exhaust its supply that from September 1877 to May 1878 not a single drop fell from heaven. There is a severe drought and the town suffered almost 10 months of arid climate people are parched and feel the searing heat pierced their bodies and crops were devastated and no <b>single</b> <b>harvest</b> took place in 1878 because it was a toxic year of famine, disease and death. On March 1, 1878 at eight in the evening, a huge fire reduced to ashes some 180 houses in Balud and Dawis (now Liboon and Rodriguez Streets respectively) just near the town plaza. Many got sick and perished in the dreaded months of August to December 1878 due to low resistance brought by deficient food intake. Almost 3,000 elderly people and children died on this tragic period and anemia and gastroenteritis were the leading cause of their early deaths. Another pestilence happen in August 1882 and according to the records some 900 people perished. A strong earthquake shook the town on February 2, 1887 which caused the stone image of St. Augustine which sits on top of the main door of the church to fell. The turn of the century with the coming of the American doesn't augurs well to the town. On September 8, 1900 tragedy struck with the outbreak of the cholera and the epidemic according to the official records took the lives of at least 700 people and this does not include those in the remote villages.|$|E

While the <b>single</b> <b>harvest</b> option and its value at optimal harvest time are expressible as products of the timber price and forest size, the replanting option is not, so the principle of similarity sometimes used to reduce the dimensions of two factor models does not apply.

40|$|Silage maize variety testing systems usually {{evaluate}} {{new varieties}} within properly defined maturity groups; within a maturity group, all varieties are harvested on a <b>single</b> <b>harvest</b> date. In {{a small country}} like Belgium where growing conditions are similar across the maize growing areas, all tested silage maize varieties, comprising different maturity groups, are harvested on a single date. Under this testing system, only few varieties are harvested at the physiological stage where they theoretically show their optimal performance. In the current research, eight silage maize varieties were monitored from 25 to 40 % whole-crop dry matter (DM) content at three locations in Belgium during the period 2007 - 2009. The optimal harvest date was calculated as the date where whole-crop DM yield, ear DM yield and organic matter digestibility were maximal. The variety rank at the optimal harvest date was compared with the variety rank at any studied <b>single</b> <b>harvest</b> date. Harvest dates where the variety rank was not statistically different to the rank at the optimal harvest date were pooled in a 'harvest window'. Based on the current data, the harvest window comprised a flexible harvest period of about 14 days. It was therefore concluded that applying a <b>single</b> <b>harvest</b> date is scientifically justified for the ranking of silage maize varieties in Belgium, when the whole-crop DM content is between 28. 1 and 40. 6 % with a maximum difference of 7. 2 % between all compared varieties...|$|E

Numerical {{results show that the}} piezoelectric-electromagnetic energy harvester has three times the bandwidth and higher power output in comparison with the corresponding stand-alone, <b>single</b> <b>harvesting</b> mode devices. The finite element models of the piezoelectric and electromagnetic systems were developed, respectively. A finite element analysis was performed. Experiments were carried out to verify the validity of the numerical simulation and the finite element results. It shows that the power output and the peak frequency obtained from the numerical analysis and the finite element simulation are in good agreement with the experimental results. This study provides a promising method to broaden the frequency bandwidth and increase the energy harvesting power output for energy harvesters.

40|$|Double {{high-dose}} chemotherapy (HDCT) {{was applied}} to 18 patients with highrisk neuroblastoma including 14 patients who could not achieve complete response (CR) even after the first HDCT. In 12 patients, successive double HDCT was rescued with peripheral blood stem cells collected during a single round of leukaphereses and in 6 patients, second or more rounds of leukaphereses were necessary after the first HDCT to rescue the second HDCT. The median interval {{between the first and}} second HDCT (76 days; range, 47 - 112) in the <b>single</b> <b>harvest</b> group was shorter than that (274. 5 days; range, 83 - 329) in the double harvest group (p< 0. 01). Hematologic recovery was slow in the second HDCT. Six (33. 3 %) treatment-related mortalities (TRM) occurred during the second HDCT but were not related to the shorter interval. Disease-free survival rates at 2 years with a median follow-up of 24 months (range, 6 - 46) in the single and double harvest group were 57. 1 % and 33. 3 %, respectively.

40|$|Giant reed (Arundo donax L.) is a {{perennial}} rhizomatous grass producing high biomass yields in temperate and warm climates under rainfed and reduced input conditions. Harvest time and frequency typically affect the productivity and suitability for energy conversion of energy crops. In order {{to evaluate the}} effect of different cutting managements on biomass yield and quality of giant reed, three <b>single</b> <b>harvest</b> (SH) and six double harvest (DH) systems were compared. Biomass yield, leaf mass ratio, dry matter (DM), and ash content were assessed for each harvest. Over the 2 years of study, giant reed demonstrated good productivity levels both when harvested once a year and twice a year (about 30 Mg ha− 1) without {{significant differences between the}} treatments. Regarding double-cut regimes, overall yields were significantly reduced by delaying the second cut from autumn to winter (32. 9 vs 30. 2 Mg ha− 1), and the percentage of the first cut with respect to the overall yield varied from 55 to 80 %. Biomass quality was also significantly affected by harvest time and frequency. The biomass obtained in double harvest systems showed higher average moisture levels (about 40 % DM) and ash concentrations ranging from 4. 7 to 8. 7 %. In contrast, <b>single</b> <b>harvest</b> systems led to a drier biomass (47 – 57 % DM) and reduced mineral contents (3. 4 – 4. 8 % ash).

30|$|A lot of {{excellent}} works on energy management in energy harvesting sensor networks have been done. For example, two-stage communication power management algorithms were proposed for maximizing {{the utility of}} energy harvesting sensors, considering the energy neutrality constraint, the fixed power loss effects of circuitry, and the battery inefficiency and its capacity [5]. Energy allocation over source acquisition/compression and transmission for a <b>single</b> energy <b>harvesting</b> sensor was addressed which guarantees minimum average distortion while ensuring stability of the queue connecting source and channel encoders [6]. Discounted cost Markov decision process and reinforcement learning algorithms were applied to find optimal energy management policies to maximize {{the performance of a}} <b>single</b> energy <b>harvesting</b> sensor [7]. Through modeling the ambient energy supply by a two-state Markov chain and assuming a finite battery capacity, low-complexity transmission policies were proposed for a wireless sensor powered by an energy harvesting device [8]. Conditions for balancing a node’s expected energy consumption with its expected energy harvesting capability in a uniformly formed wireless sensor network were derived [9]. A stochastic Markov chain framework was proposed to characterize the interplay between the battery discharge policy and the irreversible degradation of the storage capacity [10].|$|R

The output demonstrated that no <b>single</b> <b>harvesting</b> method of those considered (centrifugation, settlement or flocculation) produced an energy output sufficiently greater than operational energy inputs to make microalgal biogas production energetically viable. Combinations of harvesting methods could produce energy outputs 2. 3 – 3. 4 times greater than the operational energy inputs. Electrical energy to power pumps, mixers and harvesting systems was 5 – 8 times greater than the heating energy requirement. If the energy to power the plant is generated locally in a combined heat and power unit, a considerable amount of ‘low grade’ heat will be available that is not required by the process, and for the system to show a net operational energy return this must be exploited.
