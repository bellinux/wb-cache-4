500|$|As a {{displaced}} girl, Maya's pain is worsened by {{an awareness}} of her displacement. [...] She is [...] "the forgotten child", and must {{come to terms with}} [...] "the unimaginable reality" [...] of being unloved and unwanted; <b>she</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hostile world that defines beauty in terms of whiteness and that rejects her simply because she is a Black girl. Maya internalizes the rejection she has experienced – her belief in her own ugliness was [...] "absolute". McPherson believes that the concept of family, or what she calls [...] "kinship concerns", in Angelou's books must be understood {{in the light of the}} children's displacement at the beginning of Caged Bird. Being sent away from their parents was a psychological rejection, and resulted in a quest for love, acceptance, and self-worth for both Maya and Bailey.|$|E

Referencing her experience as a black woman in the White House, she said that although <b>she</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> [...] "house that was built by slaves," [...] seeing her children play on the White House lawn fills her with hope. She said: [...] "Don't let anyone ever {{tell you that this}} country is not great. That somehow we need to make it great again. Because this right now is the greatest country on Earth." [...] The Atlantic described the speech as the best of the night and called it a speech [...] "for the ages", a qualification echoed in other publications. David Smith of The Guardian called it a [...] "profound, moving and devastating riposte to Donald Trump".|$|E
2500|$|Kay's Phantom {{is not a}} sequel, {{but rather}} a retelling of the {{original}} Leroux novel. While the book draws mainly from Leroux's text, there are also obvious references to Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical: several phrases from the musical's lyrics are used to describe certain circumstances in the book. There are also nods to the Lon Chaney film version of the story. The character of Javert shares his name with the obsessive police captain who hunts Jean Valjean for twenty years in Victor Hugo's novel Les Misérables. [...] The storyline surrounding Erik's vain, childish mother bears some glancing similarities to Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary; like Emma Bovary, <b>she</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stultifyingly provincial town and is courted by a medical man.|$|E
2500|$|Samantha Jane [...] "Sam" [...] Marquez (Vanessa Marcil) is {{the self-proclaimed}} best casino host in the world. [...] <b>She</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Montecito suite, and {{is portrayed as}} a {{ruthless}} businessperson whose sole interest is to get high rollers {{to play at the}} Montecito. [...] However, in the season-four episode, [...] "The Burning Bedouin", she reveals that she is only [...] "cold and jaded because everyone expects it of her", and [...] "underneath it all, she is weak and pathetic like everyone else." [...] She was married to billionaire Casey Manning, from whom she was estranged for seven years prior to divorcing. She is also involved in an on-and-off relationship with Det. Woody Hoyt from Crossing Jordan, which ends officially based on the events from season-four episode, [...] "History of Violins". From [...] "The Burning Bedouin", she is seen to be currently in love with and waiting for Jeremy, who fell into a 20-year coma after falling off a stool at a slot machine; he is the man who first brought her to Las Vegas from Austin, Texas. Following the death of her ex-husband Casey in a freak fishing accident (he is later revealed to have been poisoned), Sam is left control of the casino. She becomes the latest former owner of the Montecito after failing to pay the back taxes owed on the property. Her ownership of the Montecito lasts for a week, when A.J. Cooper buys the Montecito by paying off the back taxes. A.J. fires Sam when she is rude to his ranch manager's son. After Delinda intervenes, Sam and Cooper work things out over a milkshake, bowling, beers, and cigars, and Cooper agrees to rehire Sam. Sam is originally from Texas and enjoys playing bingo. [...] In the season-five finale, Casey Manning's younger brother Vic Manning visits the Montecito to take over the ownership of the casino. At the end of the show, Sam and Vic are said to plan to get married. When asked why Sam wants to marry Vic – she always stated she did not have feelings for him, though he loved her – she says it is because Vic understands her and will not try to change her; plus, he reminds her of Casey.|$|E
