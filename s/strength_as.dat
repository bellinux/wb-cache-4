5|$|A {{hurricane}} formed {{north of}} Hispaniola on August 25. It moved westward, passing over the Inagua Islands before striking {{the north coast}} of Cuba as a Category 2 hurricane on August27. The cyclone weakened to Category 1 <b>strength</b> <b>as</b> it crossed the island, close to Matanzas, but regained first Category 2 and then Category 3 <b>strength</b> <b>as</b> it moved north through the Gulf of Mexico. The cyclone made landfall near Panama City, Florida, on August31 as a Category2 hurricane. Thereafter, it then quickly weakened to a tropical storm while moving northward through Georgia and South Carolina. The storm entered the Atlantic {{from the state of}} Virginia on next day and dissipated on September3.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Cristobal was a {{moderately}} strong Atlantic tropical cyclone that affected multiple landmasses from Puerto Rico to Iceland in late August and early September2014. Slow to develop, and plagued by unfavorable wind shear {{for most of}} its life, the storm formed on August23 near the Caicos Islands from a long-tracked tropical wave. Moving generally northward, Cristobal gradually intensified despite a ragged appearance on satellite imagery, and passed midway between Bermuda and North Carolina on August 27. While accelerating toward the northeast the next day, Cristobal achieved its peak <b>strength</b> <b>as</b> a Category 1hurricane. A colder environment converted Cristobal into an extratropical cyclone on August29, but it retained much of its <b>strength</b> <b>as</b> it sped across the northern Atlantic and struck Iceland on September1.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Michelle {{developed}} from a tropical wave that {{moved across the}} Atlantic, and formed into a tropical depression on October 29. Convection increased, and the system formed into Tropical Storm Michelle on November 1. It strengthened further, reaching its peak <b>strength</b> <b>as</b> a Category 4. One of only four November Category 4 hurricanes, Michelle made landfall on south-central Cuba with winds of 140mph (225km/h), the strongest Cuban landfall since Hurricane Fox in the 1952 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of August 25, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made {{landfall}} as a Category 1 hurricane near the Miami-Dade–Broward county line in southern Florida and weakened into a tropical storm as a result. The next morning, after passing over the state, Tropical Storm Katrina moved into the Gulf of Mexico, and reintensified back to hurricane <b>strength.</b> <b>As</b> the hurricane passed over the warm waters of the Loop Current, the hurricane began to undergo rapid deepening.|$|E
5|$|The British {{correctly}} {{estimated the}} German <b>strength</b> <b>as</b> 250 aircraft. To meet the threat the Fighter Controllers at 11 Group's Uxbridge centre scrambled 13 Squadrons; No. 12 Group at Watnall passed on ordered to four more. Soon, a combined total of 47 Spitfires and 97 Hurricanes {{were in the}} air. Ten of the RAF fighters in the air (nine Spitfires from No. 19 Squadron and one Hurricane from No. 151 Squadron) were armed with 20mm cannon.|$|E
5|$|The main factor {{behind this}} shift {{is the high}} summer {{temperature}} difference between Central Asia and the Indian Ocean. This {{is accompanied by a}} seasonal excursion of the normally equatorial intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), a low-pressure belt of highly unstable weather, northward towards India. This system intensified to its present <b>strength</b> <b>as</b> a result of the Tibetan Plateau's uplift, which accompanied the Eocene–Oligocene transition event, a major episode of global cooling and aridification which occurred 34–49Ma.|$|E

5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} {{titanium}} and titanium alloys are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile <b>strength</b> <b>as</b> a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E

5|$|After this, the {{battalion}} came under {{command of the}} re-formed 17th Brigade, which was reconstituted to bring the 7th Division up to full <b>strength</b> <b>as</b> it operated along the coast. Despite being well below strength– consisting of just two companies {{with a total of}} 300 men– it joined the fighting at Damour on 6–10 July, advancing along the Darmour River and leading the 17th Brigade's advance. Amidst heavy fighting the Allied forces slowly advanced simultaneously along the coast and inland, finally overcoming the Vichy French defences. Following the armistice on 14 July, the troops remained in Syria until January 1942 preparing defences and undertaking other garrison duties. The battalion's casualties during the short campaign amounted to 16 killed and 77 wounded.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Ophelia {{moved past}} Cape Hatteras it {{turned to the}} east. Wind shear {{increased}} on September 16 and weakened Ophelia into a tropical storm for the last time. Ophelia turned to the northeast and brushed past Nantucket Island, Massachusetts on the next day. As it approached Nova Scotia on September 17, the storm became extratropical, but maintained its <b>strength</b> <b>as</b> it made landfall in the extreme eastern portion of the province. The extratropical storm passed over southern Newfoundland later that day, before finally dissipating on September 23 in the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|As the TUTT {{gradually}} warmed, Gordon {{was able}} to undergo a prolonged period of rapid intensification, despite having restricted outflow. Over a 30-hour period from July14 to 15, the storm's central pressure decreased by 70mbar (hPa; 2.07inHg), just below the threshold for explosive intensification. At {{the end of this}} phase, Gordon attained its peak <b>strength</b> <b>as</b> a Category5 equivalent super typhoon with winds estimated at 260km/h (160mph). Around the same time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed the storm to have attained 10-minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph) along with a minimum pressure of 915mbar (hPa; 27.02inHg).|$|E

5|$|Asia League {{was created}} {{primarily}} {{for the development of}} hockey in Asia. The league allows teams to hire a small number of imports to play on the team in order to even out <b>strength</b> <b>as</b> well as increase the level of competitiveness in the league. Playing against more skilled foreign players will allow players from the participating countries to increase their skills and benefit from having some more experienced players on their teams. China is allowed the most imports while the experienced Japanese teams are allowed the fewest. As part of some sponsorship deals China was provided western players from the San Jose Sharks, and the two Chinese teams were provided Swedish players when the Nordic Vikings were active in the league.|$|E
5|$|At 5:32 pm CST (2332 UTC), a {{supercell}} thunderstorm {{produced a}} multiple-vortex tornado in Southaven, Mississippi. The tornado first struck Southaven High School, where 30 windows were broken, minor roof damage occurred, and damage was rated EF0. In the nearby Carriage Hill subdivision, several homes sustained minor damage as well. The tornado rapidly intensified to EF2 <b>strength</b> <b>as</b> it crossed {{the intersection of}} Stateline Road and Airways Boulevard, destroying three warehouse buildings. One of the buildings destroyed was the Cooper Lighting Plant, and a gas station in this area was damaged as well. Numerous trees and power poles were also downed in Southaven.|$|E
5|$|Because males emerge {{earlier than}} females, the males compete for mating territories {{surrounding}} the nests {{in which the}} females are located. During a fight, the males risk damaging their wings or appendages by butting and grappling. Another defense technique is to grab another male and carry it high into the air, which {{is thought to be}} a demonstration of <b>strength.</b> <b>As</b> a general rule, the larger the male the more predominant he is in battles. Age influences the success in the defense and security of territory; the younger the wasp the greater the chance of a successful takeover of territory. Some small males even engage in non-territorial mating tactics, and delay their emergence so as to have a fairer chance of survival.|$|E
