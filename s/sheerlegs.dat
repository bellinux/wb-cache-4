5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} of delicate problems {{that had never been}} encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a cofferdam around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating <b>sheerlegs</b> attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|E
50|$|Forms of {{derricks}} {{are commonly}} found aboard ships and at docking facilities. Some large derricks are mounted on dedicated vessels, and known as floating derricks and <b>sheerlegs.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fixed {{shear legs}} are most {{commonly}} found on floating cranes known as <b>sheerlegs.</b> These have heavy A-frame booms and vary in lifting capacity between 50 and 4,000 tons, {{and are used}} principally in shipbuilding, other large scale fabrication, cargo management, and salvage operations.|$|E
5000|$|A {{floating}} <b>sheerleg</b> {{or simply}} <b>sheerleg</b> is a floating water vessel with a crane (the [...] "sheerleg" [...] itself), which, unlike a crane vessel, is {{not capable of}} rotating its crane independently of its hull.|$|R

50|$|<b>Sheerlegs</b> are {{commonly}} used for salvaging ships, assistance in shipbuilding, loading and unloading large cargo into ships, and bridge building. They have grown considerably larger over the last decades due to a marked increase in vessel, cargo, and component size (of ships, offshore oil rigs, and other large fabrications), resulting in heavier lifts both during construction and in salvage operations.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a huge}} {{variety in}} sheerleg capacity. The smaller cranes start around 50 tons in lifting capacity, with the largest being able to lift 10,000 tons. The bigger <b>sheerlegs</b> usually have their own {{propulsion}} system and have a large accommodation facility on board, while smaller units are floating pontoons {{that need to be}} towed to their workplace by tugboats.|$|E
50|$|While {{transporting}} the <b>sheerleg,</b> {{the heel}} pin support may be moved towards {{the bow of}} the barge in order to lower the boom and the overall profile of the barge, facilitating transport.|$|R
50|$|Shear legs, {{also known}} as sheers, shears, or sheer legs, are a form of two-legged lifting device. Shear legs may be permanent, formed of a solid A-frame and supports, as {{commonly}} seen on land and the floating <b>sheerleg,</b> or temporary, as aboard a vessel lacking a fixed crane or derrick.|$|R
50|$|Lifting {{equipment}}, {{also known}} as lifting gear, is a general term for any equipment {{that can be used}} to lift loads. This includes jacks, block and tackle, vacuum lifts, hoists, rotating screws, gantries, A frames, gin poles, shear legs, <b>sheerleg,</b> windlasses, lifting harnesses, fork lifts, hydraulic lifting pads, air lift bags, and cranes.|$|R
50|$|Two legs, called cheeks, {{are bound}} {{together}} {{as in the}} <b>sheerlegs.</b> The third spar is called the prypole and is fixed under the cheeks. Only four pulleys are required; three as splay tackles and the fourth one as lifting purchase. A timber hitch of six figure-of-eight turns and a finishing clove hitch lash the crutch but not too tight because the cheeks need some room to spread their heels. The cheeks of the gyn are now ready to spread and to be erected, the cheek splay tackle is hauled tight {{and then the other}} adjacent splay tackles can be lashed. At the sides, the gyn is unstable and it is crucial that the cargo is not swung out of the base triangle; consequently the gyn is only for lifting cargo vertically.|$|E
50|$|Overseas Tankship had a ship, the Wagon Mound, docked in Sydney Harbour in October 1951. The {{crew had}} {{carelessly}} allowed furnace oil (also {{referred to as}} Bunker oil) to leak from their ship. The oil drifted under a wharf thickly coating {{the water and the}} shore where other ships were being repaired. Hot metal produced by welders using oxyacetylene torches on the respondent's timber wharf (Mort's Dock) at <b>Sheerlegs</b> Wharf fell on floating cotton waste which ignited the oil on the water. The wharf and ships moored there sustained substantial fire damage. In an action by Mort's Dock for damages for negligence it was found as a fact that the defendants did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that the oil was capable of being set alight when spread on water. The dock owners knew the oil was there, and continued to use welders.|$|E

50|$|A crane vessel, crane ship or {{floating}} crane is a ship with a crane specialized in lifting heavy loads. The largest crane vessels {{are used for}} offshore construction. Conventional monohulls are used, but the largest crane vessels are often catamaran or semi-submersible types as they have increased stability. On a <b>sheerleg</b> crane, the crane is fixed and cannot rotate, and the vessel therefore is manoeuvered to place loads.|$|R

40|$|The {{floating}} <b>sheerlegs</b> of SMIT {{are used}} for a large variety of tasks in sheltered, near shore as well as offshore environments. Generally the tasks vary from recovering operations (salvage) to inshore installation work. Originally, the usage of floating <b>sheerlegs</b> was driven by their robustness, needed for recovering work and shallow draft, needed for working near shore. In the past years the <b>sheerlegs</b> of SMIT became increasingly utilized for installation work offshore. As a result, {{the need for more}} detailed analysis showing the feasibility, related safety and reliability of operations emerged. In the engineering phase of such offshore installation projects these aspects are analyzed for each operational phase from load-out, towage to offshore lifting and installation. This paper addresses the crucial elements {{that need to be addressed}} when a floating <b>sheerlegs</b> is utilized for offshore installation work. The engineering topics that will be discussed in this paper are stability, strength and multi body dynamics. To demonstrate the relevance and validity of the discussed topics, an offshore installation project is analyzed in terms of measured motions and wave conditions...|$|E
40|$|To {{guaranty}} {{safety of}} the vessel, operation and especially the people during offshore activities, a motion analysis is executed. The motion analysis determines the motions over the entire frequency spectrum. Motions are amplified when incoming wave frequencies come to {{the vicinity of the}} natural frequency of the vessel, hence a very interesting region concerning the {{safety of the}} operation. In the vicinity of the natural frequency the motions are highly dependent on the present damping, therefore an accurate prediction of the damping is desired. This thesis study aims to improve the roll damping operation of <b>sheerlegs</b> (barge-type vessels) Taklift 4 and Taklift 7 during a lifting opertation. This is achieved by implementing the viscous roll damping component and investigating the effect of a vertical center of gravity well above the waterline. A high VCG results in a coupled motion between roll and sway. The effect of a high vertical center of gravity on the potential and viscous roll damping is studied. Furtermore, the viscous roll damping is determined applying three different techniques. Finally all models are validated with data from pre-executed experiments. Theory developed by Ikeda, Tanaka and Himeno (IHT) is implemented to compute the viscous roll damping for ship shaped hulls and barge-type hulls. IHT theory is the ITTC recommended procedure for practical assesment of viscous roll damping in absence of experiments, as long as the hull dimensions and motion conditions are within the set limitations. Two numerical models are developed according to IHT theory, the IHT - Ship model and IHT - Barge model. The IHT - Ship model is verified and showed no discrepancies with the verifying document. However, the calculated viscous roll damping for the Taklift 4 is surprisingly small when compared to the potential roll damping. The estimation of the bilge radius and the lewis transformation to determine the velocity increment appeared to be the least accurate parameters causing an inaccurate viscous roll damping estimation. After the IHT - Barge model is developed, it is directly validated together with the ‘κ-formula’-model against the decay test data. Journee designed the κ-formula’-model, which contains the potential roll damping ratio and a viscous contribution multiplied with the square-root of the roll angle. The validation shows that the ‘κ-formula’-model consistently estimates the viscous roll damping in a more accurate manner for barges where 5 ≤B/T≤ 7. 5. Unfortunately, the decay tests were limited with an initial roll angles up to five or six degrees. It is rather challenging to define a limitation concerning a roll angle for this approach. Therefore, the ‘κ-formula’-model can safely be used, but for large roll angles it is advised to maintain a conservative user approach. For barges where B/T= 10, the IHT – Barge model is not appropriate and also the ‘κ-formula’-model is accurate for roll angles smaller than 2. 5 degrees. It is suggested the free surface effects ‘hide’ the dependence of the viscous roll damping and the roll angle. The third technique to determine the viscous roll damping, is the so-called Magnuson approach. Magnuson applied an equivalent linearization procedure on the experimental data of the Noble Denton JIP to determine the viscous roll damping. To develop the Magnuson approach, experimental data providing motion response and environmental conditions is required. Such data is not available for the Taklift 4 and Taklift 7, hence results from pre-executed experiments are used, which among other things contains free decay test results and behavior in regular beam waves for rectangular scale models with similar dimensions as the Taklift 4 and Taklift 7. The main difference between the vessels studied in this thesis scope and pre-executed experiments, is the height the vertical center of gravity (VCG). A VCG above the waterline causes the response motion to change from 'pure' roll to a coupled roll-sway motion. Due to a phase difference between the coupled terms and b 44 and b 22 term, the B 44 p is decreasing for increasing VCG. The B 44 p coefficient becomes zero for a certain location of the VCG, which could not be explained physically in this thesis. The effect of the VCG on the b 44 v is positive. It is suggested the coupled roll-sway motion and secondary separation can account for this. An attempt is made to determine viscous effects of b 24, b 42 and b 22. Very limited studies are executed on this topic, hence {{it is very difficult to}} determine the correctness of the computations. After all developed models were compared with each other, the Magnuson approach showed most promise. Therefore this approach is used to determine the viscous roll damping of the Taklift 4 and Taklift 7. Viscous damping ratios of 0. 041 and 0. 034 respectively, were computed for the most similar scale models, hence a viscous damping ratio of 0. 0375 for both Taklift vessels is determined. It is left for future work to determine how the workability of the Taklift 4 and Taklift 7 is increased by the more accurate roll damping prediction.
