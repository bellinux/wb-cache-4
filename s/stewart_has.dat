25|$|BNL's second album, Maybe You Should Drive, {{released}} in 1994, fared considerably less {{well with the}} Canadian public. They tried touring the United States, but the tour was a failure and ended up losing money despite an appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Before the next release Andy Creeggan {{decided to leave the}} band. He had become disillusioned with the direction of the band, and was not comfortable with the fame the group had attained. According to Page, he had considered leaving as early as the rehearsals for the Drive album; The rest of the band convinced him to stay to record that album, and for the subsequent touring. In addition, Creeggan wanted to attend McGill University to study music further. Tyler <b>Stewart</b> <b>has</b> also suggested that Creeggan had never fully accepted his replacement by Stewart as percussionist. Andy Creeggan's departure came during a time in which members of the band were starting to become sick of each other, with Page and Robertson rarely speaking to one another. Stewart cites the departure as worsening the situation. Page also began struggling with both alcohol abuse and depression. In an attempt to correct the band's downward slide, they signed with Terry McBride and Nettwerk as their management.|$|E

500|$|Though the {{committee}} did not record minutes of its proceedings, three key surviving documents offer clues to {{the committee}}'s handiwork: an outline by Randolph with edits by Rutledge, extensive notes and a second draft by Wilson, also with Rutledge's edits, and the committee's final report to the Convention. From this evidence {{it is thought that}} the committee used the original Virginia Plan, the decisions of the Convention on modifications to that plan, and other sources, such as the Articles of Confederation, provisions of the state constitutions, and even Charles Pinckney's plan, to produce the first full draft, which author David O. <b>Stewart</b> <b>has</b> called a [...] "remarkable copy-and-paste job." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{questions}} about the veracity of Chatwin's writing are compounded by the revelation of his sexual orientation and the true cause of his death. Once it became known that Chatwin had been bisexual and had died of an AIDS-related illness, some critics viewed him as a liar and dismissed his work. Nicholas Shakespeare said, [...] "His denial [...] bred a sense that if he lied about his life, he must have lied about his work. Some readers have taken this as a cue to pass judgement on his books – or else not to bother with them." [...] In 2010 The Guardian's review of Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin opened with the question, [...] "Does anyone read Bruce Chatwin these days?" [...] However, Rory <b>Stewart</b> <b>has</b> stated, [...] "His personality, his learning, his myths, and even his prose are less hypnotizing [...] And yet he remains a great writer, of deep and enduring importance.” In 2008 The Times [...] named Chatwin #46 on their list of [...] "50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945".|$|E
