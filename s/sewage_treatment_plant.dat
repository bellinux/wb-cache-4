50|$|In the 1980s, the Angelina & Neches River Authority was {{contracted}} by the Texas Department of Water Resources {{to carry}} out studies on <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment.</b> One such study was a study of seven municipal <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> in East Texas in 1982.

5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E
5|$|On June 18, 1998, {{a severe}} storm damaged the estate. Heavy rains caused the {{drainage}} system to fail and {{a cascade of}} water surged over the retaining wall. This caused a mudslide, damaging the estate's foundation. Furthermore, the large oak tree {{at the center of}} the courtyard fell down on top of the house. The next year, another storm collapsed a tunnel underneath the studio wing. A 1999 grant from Save America's Treasures helped defray costs to re-roof Taliesin III, to stabilize its foundation, and to connect it to a local <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Continuing south-southwest, {{the river}} {{along with the}} parkway and trailway enter Hastings-on-Hudson, its {{greenbelt}} the only major break in the village's dense suburban development. It slowly veers toward a more southerly heading, and enters the Nepera Park neighborhood of Yonkers after one mile (1.6km), just south of Farragut Parkway. Once in the neighborhood, the Saw Mill River flows through a Yonkers <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant,</b> the other impoundment of the river. After leaving the plant, 1.5 miles (2km) {{to the south of}} where the river entered Yonkers, the parkway and trailway diverge from the river after , to climb over the watershed divide to Tibbetts Brook.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, a {{dredging}} project was proposed on Leggetts Creek {{to repair the}} damage caused by acid mine drainage and coal mining. In 1991, the Lackawanna River Corridor Association gathered data on the water chemistry and biological habitats of Leggetts Creek. In 2012, the South Abington Sewer Authority began upgrading its <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> to prevent wastewater and nutrient pollution from entering the creek. They also installed new sewer lines, including some that run parallel to or under the creek. PA Trout Unlimited's AMD Technical Assistance Program conducted a survey of the fish population in the creek on November 15, 2013. The Lackawanna Valley Conservancy once received a $190,000 Growing Greener grant for the Leggetts Creek Greenway.|$|E

5|$|Air pollution, lack {{of proper}} waste {{management}} infrastructure and degradation of water bodies {{are the major}} environmental issues in Coimbatore. There is a <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of sewage water per day. Garbage is collected by the corporation and sewage is pumped into the water tanks and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. The tanks are renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and the corporation. The corporation is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks. Siruthuli, an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river. Environment Conservation Group based {{out of the city}} is also involved in conservation of trees and wetlands, monitoring wildlife crime and conducting awareness sessions for students.|$|E

5|$|East of I-405, SR522 enters Woodinville {{and follows}} Little Bear Creek {{as it turns}} north away from the city's downtown, {{intersecting}} SR202. The freeway enters Snohomish County and intersects SR9 south of the Brightwater <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant.</b> It continues in a stairstep pattern, moving north and east with sharp turns to parallel the Eastside Rail Corridor, through a predominantly rural area In Maltby, the freeway reaches an at-grade intersection with Paradise Lake Road (SR524) and becomes a two-lane undivided highway. SR522 travels northeast from Maltby, intersecting Echo Lake Road in a single-point urban interchange, and crosses the Snohomish River into Monroe. Within Monroe, the highway widens to a four-lane freeway with median separation and intersects Main Street in a dogbone interchange near the Monroe Correctional Complex. SR522 cuts across suburban housing areas in Monroe, and crosses over US2 and the BNSF Railway near the Evergreen State Fairgrounds. The highway makes a 180-degree turn south to intersect with US2, where it terminates; the intersection also has a direct offramp for eastbound traffic from SR522 to eastbound US2.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Leggetts Creek sometimes exceeds its total maximum daily load, especially during low flow conditions and the summer months. There are some mine drainage issues on the creek between Rockwell Avenue and Charles Street. It experiences some flow loss to underground mine voids. In 1978, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (now known as the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection) estimated that the creek lost 20 to 30 percent of its flow to mines during dry weather. However, the creek is large enough that this does not cause aquatic habitat to be lost. The Chinchilla <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> discharges into the creek {{in the vicinity of}} Leggetts Gap. In its lower reaches, the creek is impacted by past mining, urban development, and debris. Stormwater also flows into the Lackawanna River via the creek and it is affected by fine sediment. There is one stormwater detention facility in the watershed, at Leggett's Creek Estates.|$|E
5|$|The City of Lock Haven {{owns the}} {{reservoirs}} and water distribution system for Wayne Township, Castanea Township, and the city. Water is treated at the Central Clinton County Water Filtration Authority Plant in Wayne Township before distribution. The city also provides {{water to the}} Suburban Lock Haven Water Authority, which distributes it to surrounding communities. Lock Haven operates a <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> for waste water, industrial waste, and trucked sewage {{from the city and}} eight upstream municipalities: Bald Eagle Township, Castanea, Flemington, Lamar, Mill Hall, Porter Township, Woodward Township, and Walker Township in Centre County. Storm water runoff from within the city is transported by city-owned storm sewers. Curbside pickup of household garbage is provided by a variety of local haulers licensed by the city; recyclables are picked up once every two weeks. The Clinton County Solid Waste Authority owns and operates the Wayne Township Landfill, which serves Lock Haven.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} define the source of Salmonella {{contamination}} found on the North Sea coast of Niedersachsen, Salmonella strains were isolated from surface waters (River Ems, North Sea) of this area and analysed together with those strains originating from suspected sources (human patients, <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants,</b> and cattle). Although {{a variety of different}} Salmonella serotypes was isolated, the majority of the isolates from coastal waters consisted of Salmonella typhimurium. Characterisation and comparison of the strains from different sources was done by determining their plasmid profiles and antibiotic resistence patterns. By these methods clear differences could be detected between the isolates of bovine origin {{on the one hand and}} those from humans, <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants,</b> and surface waters on the other hand. The overwhelming part of the cattle isolates showed a specific plasmidprofile together with multiple antibiotic resistances. Most of the isolates from human patients, surface waters, and <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> in contrast displayed only the serovar specific virulence plasmid and to a great extend sensitivity to all antibiotic tested. The data show that the Salmonella from the North Sea did not originate from cattle. Probably they came from human sources and might have spread to seawater by <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants.</b> Therefore the microbiological properties of the <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> should be the subject of further monitoring programmes. Attention should be paid that discharge from the <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> cannot contaminate bathing areas. In the case of continuing contamination sanitary measures in the <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> in question have to be taken in order to avoid the closure of beaches. (orig.)

25|$|The treated {{effluent}} from <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> {{may also}} reach the aquifer if the effluent is infiltrated or discharged to local surface water bodies. Therefore, those substances {{that are not}} removed in conventional <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> may reach the groundwater as well.

This is because in conventional <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants,</b> micro-pollutants such as hormones, pharmaceutical residues and other micro-pollutants contained in urine and feces are only partially removed and the remainder is discharged into surface water, from where it may also reach the groundwater.|$|R
5|$|The River Don Navigation {{ended at}} Tinsley Wharf, but {{it forms a}} {{convenient}} place to start {{a description of the}} route. The wharf was on the river, just upstream from the present junction with the canal to Sheffield. It was close {{to the site of the}} Meadowhall Shopping Centre and the Tinsley Viaduct, which carries the M1 motorway over the valley of the River Don. From here there is a towpath along the canal to Victoria Quays (formerly Sheffield Basin) in Sheffield City Centre, or the Five Weirs Walk follows the course of the River Don to the same destination. The towpath extends to Rotherham in the opposite direction, passing the large Jordans Weir and the three locks on the Holmes Cut. Beside Jordans Weir is the outfall from Blackburn Meadows <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant.</b> In dry weather, this discharges 30 million gallons (136,000m3) of treated water each day, more than doubling the flow in the river.|$|E
5|$|The Village of Lincolnshire {{negotiated}} {{and signed}} an agreement with the City of Highland Park in 1982 to create a more efficient means of obtaining water by purchasing filtered water from Lake Michigan. The Village of Lincolnshire also monitors the public pumps and water meters of private residents. Lincolnshire is served by a sanitary sewer that connects to the Lake County <b>Sewage</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant,</b> which lies on the Des Plaines River outside the Village limits; the disposal of wastewater is left to the government of Lake County rather than the Village of Lincolnshire itself. Lincolnshire also runs a network of storm drains that run directly into the Des Plaines River; to protect the river's cleaniness, the village government has outlawed dumping of most chemicals into the network of storm drains. A plan to repair city streets was also implemented in 1982, and continues; the Village also offers public services to clear the streets during the fall and winter from fallen leaves and snow respectively, although on its arterial roads (Illinois Routes 22, 45, and Aptakisic Road) residents are provided with bags to clear their curbs during autumn months as it is not possible for the Village to safely clear these roads of leaf debris. The Village of Lincolnshire regularly sweeps other streets within its borders.|$|E
5|$|Used as a waste {{repository}} {{during the}} first half of the 20thcentury and cut off from the Columbia River by levees, the slough became one of Oregon's most polluted waterways. Early attempts to mitigate the pollution, which included raw sewage and industrial waste, were unsuccessful. However, in 1952 Portland began sewage treatment, and over the next six decades the federal Clean Water Act and similar legislation mandated further cleanup. State and local governments, often assisted by community volunteers, undertook projects related to public health, natural resources, and recreation in a region with many homes, industries, businesses, and roads. The businesses and industries in the watershed employ about 57,000people, which is also frequented by more than 150bird species and 26fish species and animals including otters, beaver, and coyotes. One of the nation's largest freshwater urban wetlands, Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area, shares the lower slough watershed with a <b>sewage</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant,</b> marine terminals, a golf course, and a car racetrack. Watercraft able to portage over culverts and levees can travel the entire length of the slough. The 40 Mile Loop and other hiking and biking trails follow the waterways and connect the parks.|$|E
