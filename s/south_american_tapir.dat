2500|$|Systematic {{recording}} of dietary intake {{while living in}} the forest entirely off wild foods suggests that about 80% of the energy in the diet comes from meat, 10% from palm starch and hearts, 10% from insect larva and honey, and 1% from fruits. Total energy intake is approximately 2700 kcal per person daily, and males acquire about 84% of all calories consumed. Children do not produce significant amounts of food until they are fully adult. Despite the presence of over 500 species of edible vertebrate prey, only nine species of mammals provide more than 1% of the prey biomass actually harvested by Aché hunters. [...] Most important (in descending order) are nine-banded armadillo, paca, <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>tapir,</b> capuchin monkey, white-lipped peccary, South American coati, red brocket, and tegu lizards.|$|E

50|$|Genetic {{evidence}} has been questioned on similar grounds. Several examined genetic sequences said to be characteristic for the species, most notably the Cyth sequence of cytochrome b, {{have been described as}} minimally divergent from those of other <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>tapirs.</b> Further analyses of cytochrome b sequences did reveal a clade allegedly belonging to T. kabomani, however, it was described to be only as divergent as some haplotype found in other species. Mitochondrial DNA originally connected to morphological traits and used to describe the species has also been called into question. Although several samples of T. kabomani have been obtained, only the two samples from Southwestern Amazonia were analysed while those obtained in the northwest were not. The connection between the morphology and DNA of supposed T. kabomani in northwestern areas is unknown and there is the possibility that the correlation between mtDNA and morphology is insufficiently supported.|$|R

40|$|The {{record of}} the genus Tapirus in South America is {{associated}} with the faunistic events of the Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI). The taxon is considered an immigrant of Holarctic origin. Although remains are scarce and incomplete during the Pleistocene, an analysis of these materials allowed us to consider valid seven fossil species : Tapirus tarijensis, T. cristatellus, T. greslebini, T. rioplatensis, T. oliverasi, T. mesopotamicus, and T. rondoniensis. A phylogenetic analysis was carried out in order to elucidate the relationships of the American fossil and extant species. Our result is consistent with a paraphyletic hypothesis for <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>tapirs</b> and suggests that a second dispersal event would have occurred from South America to North America, of a form closely related to T. cristatellus, resulting in the derived forms of North America.

50|$|At {{the end of}} the Pleistocene epoch, about 12,000 years ago, three {{dramatic}} developments {{occurred in}} the Americas at roughly the same time (geologically speaking). Paleoindians invaded and occupied the New World, the last glacial period came to an end, and a large fraction of the megafauna of both North and South America went extinct. This wave of extinctions swept {{off the face of the}} Earth many of the successful participants of the Great American Interchange, as well as other species that had not migrated. All the pampatheres, glyptodonts, ground sloths, equids, proboscids, giant short-faced bears, dire wolves and machairodont species of both continents disappeared. The last of the <b>South</b> and Central <b>American</b> notoungulates and litopterns died out, as well as North America's giant beavers, lions, dholes, native cheetahs, and many of its antilocaprid, bovid, cervid, tapirid and tayassuid ungulates. Some groups disappeared over most or all of their original range but survived in their adopted homes, e.g. <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>tapirs,</b> camelids and tremarctine bears (cougars and jaguars may have been temporarily reduced to <b>South</b> <b>American</b> refugia also). Others, such as capybaras, survived in their original range but died out in areas they had migrated to. Notably, this extinction pulse eliminated all Neotropic migrants to North America larger than about 15 kg (the size of a big porcupine), and all native <b>South</b> <b>American</b> mammals larger than about 65 kg (the size of a big capybara or giant anteater). In contrast, the largest surviving native North American mammal, the wood bison, can exceed 900 kg, and the largest surviving Nearctic migrant to South America, Baird's tapir, can reach 400 kg.|$|R
40|$|Cytogenetic Examination of <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>Tapirs,</b> Tapirus terrestris (Perissodactyla, Tapiridae) {{from the}} Wroclaw Zoological Garden. Kosowska, B., Strzała, T., Moska, M., Ratajszczak, R., Dobosz, T. - Seven lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) from Wrocław ZOO (three females and four males), differing {{from each other}} with {{exterior}} and sexual behaviour were verified with cytogenetic analysis in order to check their taxonomic status. Cytogenetic analysis was done using two alternative methods of blood collection: 1) conventionally with venepuncture, and 2) with blood sucking bugs from the Reduviidae family. Lymphocytes capable of growing were obtained only with conventional method of blood sampling. Karyotypes and karyograms of all analyzed tapirs were created using classical cytogenetic methods of chromosomes staining. All possessed karyograms had diploid chromosome number equal 80 (2 n = 80). Homologous chromosomes did not differ between each other with quantity, size, centromeres location, length of arms, G bands and all were classified as proper karyograms of Tapirus terrestris species representatives. The X chromosomes {{as well as the}} first pair of chromosomes (both metacentric), were the largest among all analyzed, respectively. All remaining 38 pairs of chromosomes were acrocentric with Y chromosome as the smallest one (in males’ karyograms). Blood collected with blood sucking bugs proved to be unsuitable for cell culture. None of the seven established cultures was effective as lymphocytes obtained with this method did not show growth potential in prepared media. Thus, blood collected from the tapirs via Dipetalogaster maxima species did not show usefulness for cytogenetic studies due to the inability of cells to proliferation, even after {{a relatively short period of}} time elapsed since the blood sampling (1 to 2 hours) ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{spectacled bear}} {{is the only}} bear native to South America and is {{technically}} the largest land carnivore on {{that part of the}} continent, although as little as 5% of its diet is composed of meat. South America's largest obligate carnivorous mammal is the jaguar (Panthera onca). Among South America's extant, native land animals, only the Baird's (Tapirus bairdii) and <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>tapirs</b> (T. terrestris) are heavier than this species. The spectacled bear is a mid-sized species of bear. Overall, its fur is blackish in color, though bears may vary from jet black to dark brown and to even a reddish hue. The species typically has distinctive beige or ginger-coloured markings across its face and upper chest, though not all spectacled bears have [...] "spectacle" [...] markings. The pattern and extent of pale markings are slightly different on each individual bear, and bears can be readily distinguished by this. Males are a third larger than females in dimensions and sometimes twice their weight. Males can weigh from 100 to 200 kg, and females can weigh from 35 to 82 kg. Head-and-body length can range from 120 to 200 cm, though mature males do not measure less than 150 cm. The tail is a mere 7 cm in length, and the shoulder height is from 60 to 90 cm. Compared to other living bears, this species has a more rounded face with a relatively short and broad snout. In some extinct species of the Tremarctinae subfamily, this facial structure has been thought to be an adaptation to a largely carnivorous diet, despite the modern spectacled bears' herbivorous dietary preferences.|$|R

5000|$|The Great Ape and Primate Forest Expansion will be {{the biggest}} project Hogle Zoo still has to undertake. The project will {{modernize}} the exhibit space for the zoo's gorillas, orangutans, and smaller primates. As part of the plan, the zoo hopes to exhibit different species together. For example, the zoo wishes to introduce its colobus monkeys in with the gorilla troop. Another plan combines the zoo's spider and howler monkeys in with other <b>South</b> <b>American</b> species like <b>tapir</b> and capybara. This idea of mixed-species exhibits will not only stimulate the animals, but it will give guests an idea of how these animals live in the wild. Primates and apes travel long distances in the wild. Therefore, another plan for the expansion is to have overhead chutes connect several exhibits to allow the animals to move to different exhibit spaces. This feature would give the animals choice, like they would have in the wild. The Great Ape and Primate Forest Expansion will also allow better viewing opportunities for the guests.|$|R
