However, in terms of construct validity, ability EI tests have great advantage over self-report scales of EI because they compare individual maximal performance to <b>standard</b> <b>performance</b> scales and do not rely on individuals' endorsement of descriptive statements about themselves.|$|E

This version, which premiered at La Scala, Milan, on 27 February 1869, has become the <b>standard</b> <b>performance</b> version.

In France, 1955, a patent was taken out by Bronnec & Gauthier for a single hose regulator, later produced as the Cristal Explorer. Over time, the convenience and performance of improved single hose regulators would make them the industry <b>standard.</b> <b>Performance</b> continues to be improved by small increments, and adaptations have been applied to rebreather technology.|$|E

Dr. Fishbein also stated that unnamed [...] "investigators" [...] were convinced that for Ali's handkerchief stunt, to produce them in the sequence stipulated by the audience Ali flavored the cloth, and could therefore taste for the correct one as he brought them up. Ali also swallowed live goldfish, watches, coins, costume jewelry, paper money, peach pits, stones, live mice, buttons, pool balls and other odd objects. In another <b>standard</b> <b>performance</b> segment, he placed eight or more lit cigarettes in his mouth but instead of inhaling, he swallowed the smoke and, after a significant time had passed, issued it forth in a steady stream like an erupting volcano.|$|E

6000|$|I am {{once more}} able, my honoured friend, to return you, {{with my own}} hand, thanks for the many {{instances}} of your friendship, and particularly for your kind anxiety in this last disaster that my evil genius had in store for me. However, life is chequered--joy and sorrow--for on Saturday morning last, Mrs. Burns made me a present of a fine boy; rather stouter, but not so handsome as your godson was at his time of life. Indeed, I look on your little namesake to be my chef d'oeuvre in that species of manufacture, as I look on [...] "Tam o' Shanter" [...] to be my <b>standard</b> <b>performance</b> in the poetical line. 'Tis true, both the one and the other discover a spice of roguish waggery, that might perhaps be as well spared; but then they also show, in my opinion, a force of genius, and a finishing polish, that I despair of ever excelling. Mrs. Burns is getting stout again, and laid as lustily about her to-day at breakfast, as a reaper from the corn-ridge. That is the peculiar privilege and blessing of our hale sprightly damsels, that are bred among the hay and heather. We cannot hope for that highly polished mind, that charming delicacy of soul, which is found among the female world in the more elevated stations of life, and which is certainly {{by far the most}} bewitching charm in the famous cestus of Venus, It is indeed such an inestimable treasure, that where it can be had in its native heavenly purity, unstained by some one or other of the many shades of affectation, and unalloyed by some one or other of the many species of caprice, I declare to Heaven I should think it cheaply purchased at the expense of every other earthly good! But as this angelic creature is, I am afraid, extremely rare in any station and rank of life, and totally denied to such an humble one as mine, we meaner mortals must put up with the next rank of female excellence. As fine a figure and face we can produce as any rank of life whatever; rustic, native grace; unaffected modesty and unsullied purity; nature's mother-wit and the rudiments of taste, a simplicity of soul, unsuspicious of, because unacquainted with, the crooked ways of a selfish, interested, disingenuous world; and the dearest charm of all the rest, a yielding sweetness of disposition, and a generous warmth of heart, grateful for love on our part, and ardently glowing with a more than equal return; these, with a healthy frame, a sound, vigorous constitution, which your higher ranks can scarcely ever hope to enjoy, are the charms of lovely woman in my humble walk of life.|$|E
