5|$|Australia has {{maintained}} military forces since federation {{as a nation}} in January 1901. Shortly after Federation, the Australian Government established the Australian Army and Commonwealth Naval Force by amalgamating the forces each of the states had maintained. In 1911, the Government established the Royal Australian Navy, which absorbed the Commonwealth Naval Force. The Army established the Australian Flying Corps in 1912 although this separated to form the Royal Australian Air Force in 1921. The services were not linked by a <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> of command, as they each reported to their own separate Minister and had separate administrative arrangements. The three services saw action around the world during World War I and World War II, and took part in conflicts in Asia during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. <b>Single</b> <b>chain</b> variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain. This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.|$|E

The agreement between calculated and experimental values of 13 C NMR longitudinal relaxation times supports the theoretical assumptions and the model parametrization.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{presence}} of condensing agents, <b>single</b> <b>chains</b> of giant double-stranded DNA undergo a first-order phase transition between an elongated coil state and a folded compact state. To connect this like-charged attraction phenomenon to counterion condensation, we performed a series of single-chain experiments on aqueous solutions of DNA, where we varied the extent of counterion condensation by varying the relative dielectric constant ɛr from 80 to 170. Single-chain observations {{of changes in the}} conformation of giant DNA were performed by transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy, with tetravalent spermine (SPM 4 +) as a condensing agent. At a fixed dielectric constant, <b>single</b> DNA <b>chains</b> fold into a compact state upon the addition of spermine, whereas at a constant spermine concentration <b>single</b> DNA <b>chains</b> unfold with an increase in ɛr. In both cases, the transition is largely discrete at the level of <b>single</b> <b>chains.</b> We found that the critical concentration of spermine necessary to induce the single-chain folding transition increases exponentially as the dielectric constant increases, corresponding to 87 – 88 % of the DNA charge neutralized {{at the onset of the}} transition. We also observed that the toroidal morphology of compact DNA partially unfolds when ɛr is increased...|$|R
25|$|It is well {{established}} that the macromolecular structure of nonviral gene delivery vectors alters their transfection efficacy and cytotoxicity. The cyclized structure has been proven to reduce cytotoxicity and increase circulation time for drug and gene delivery applications. The unique structure of cyclizing chains provides the <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> cyclized polymers a different method of interaction between the polymer and plasmid DNA, and results in a general trend of higher transfection capabilities than branched polymers. Moreover, {{due to the nature}} of the <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> structure, this cyclized polymer can “untie” to a linear chain under reducing conditions. Transfection profiles on astrocytes comparing 25 kDa-PEI, SuperFect® and Lipofectamine®2000 and cyclized polymer showed greater efficiency and cell viability whilst maintaining neural cell viability above 80% four days post transfections.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{proposes a}} new micromechanical-based {{model for the}} {{description}} of elastic and viscoelastic behaviour of rubber-like polymers at large strains. In the first part classic models of elasticity of <b>single</b> polymer <b>chains</b> are compared within a consistent model frame of statistical mechanics. Furthermore a micromechanical-based model of <b>single</b> polymer <b>chains</b> is proposed which explains the viscoelastic behaviour by entangling and disentangling processes of <b>single</b> <b>chains</b> during deformation. The new model of viscoelasticity of <b>single</b> polymer <b>chains</b> {{is one of the}} crucial points of the thesis. The second part treats the macroscopic modelling of a rubberlike polymer as a three-dimensional interacting network of chains. The developed one-dimensional models of <b>single</b> <b>chains</b> are used further on by using a new directly evaluated micro-to-macro-transition in a discrete direction space. For the description of three-dimensional viscoelasticity of rubber materials no tensorial but only scalar internal variables are used what relieves the numerical implementation substantially. The used scalar internal variables are associated with the viscous deformation on a sphere. The new directly evaluated micro-to-macro-transition in a discrete direction space forms the second crucial point of the proposed material model of viscoelasticity of rubberlike polymers. In {{the last part of the}} thesis the efficiency of the new material model is demonstrated by a comparison between experimental data and numerical simulation. (orig.)

25|$|At long ranges the {{hyperbolic}} lines approximate {{straight lines}} radiating {{from the center}} of the baseline. When two such signals from a <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> are considered, the resulting pattern of lines becomes increasingly parallel as the baseline distance becomes smaller in comparison to the range. Thus at short distances the lines cross at angles close to 90degrees, and this angle steadily reduces with range. As the accuracy of the fix depends on the crossing angle, and all hyperbolic navigation systems grow increasingly inaccurate with increasing range.|$|E
25|$|An {{intramolecular}} cyclization {{reaction is}} where the growing polymer chain reacts with a vinyl functional group on its own chain, rather than with another growing chain in the reaction system. In this way the growing polymer chain covalently links to itself in a fashion {{similar to that of}} a knot in a piece of string. As such, <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> cyclized/knotted polymers consist of many of these links (intramolecularly cyclized), as opposed to other polymer architectures including branched and crosslinked polymers that are formed by two or more polymer chains in combination.|$|E
40|$|The {{fluorescence}} of <b>single</b> <b>chains</b> of the {{conductive polymer}} poly [2 -methoxy- 5 -(2 '-ethylhexyloxy) - 1, 4 -phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV) was studied {{by means of}} single-molecule spectroscopy at 15 K. MEH-PPV was deposited onto a surface from a toluene solution {{and covered with a}} polymer cap layer of poly(vinyl alcohol) spin-coated from an aqueous solution for protection against air. Because MEH-PPV is insoluble in water, such sample preparation guarantees that MEH-PPV chains do not mix with the cap polymer. We found that this "host matrix free" environment results in substantially stronger fluorescence spectral diffusion than that observed for conjugated polymer <b>single</b> <b>chains</b> embedded into polymer matrices. The average spectral diffusion range was 500 cm(- 1), and the maximum registered value reached 1100 cm(- 1), which is similar to 6 times larger than the values reported before. We analyzed spectral diffusion by observation of temporal evolution of the fluorescence intensity, the position of the maximum, and the width of fluorescence spectra. We propose that the transition energy shifts are caused by the differences of the London dispersive forces in slightly different polymer chain conformations. Such conformational changes are possible even at low temperatures because the MEH-PPV <b>single</b> <b>chains</b> in our samples have more freedom for fluctuations than in the usual "in host" arrangement...|$|R

25|$|The Angus Steakhouse Burger was {{introduced}} in April 2008 as the replacement to the Angus burger. The new burger featured a large, square shaped Angus beef patty with two permanent variants of the sandwich with an LTO version later that year. The burger was thinner than the Angus Burger {{because many of the}} Burger King locations still used an older model broiler to cook their burgers. The older model relied solely on a <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> with uniform cooking speed and temperature which restricted the thickness of meat patties. As a result, thicker patties such as the one utilized with the previous iteration of the sandwich needed to be precooked.|$|E
25|$|In August 1943, the de Gaulle and Giraud forces merged in a <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> {{of command}} subordinated to Anglo-American leadership, {{meanwhile}} opposing French {{forces on the}} Eastern Front were subordinated to Soviet or German leaderships. This in-exile French force together with the French Forces of the Interior (FFI) played a variable-scale role in the eventual liberation of France by the Western Allies and the defeat of Vichy France, Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and the Japanese empire. Vichy France fought for control over the French overseas empire with the Free French forces, which were aided by Britain and the U.S. By 1943, all of the colonies, except for Indochina, had joined the Free French cause.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} way to normal ATRP, the {{polymerization}} is started by initiation to produce a free radical, followed by chain propagation and reversible activation/deactivation equilibrium. Unlike the polymerization of single vinyl monomers, for the polymerization of multivinyl monomers, the chain propagation occurs between the active centres {{and one of the}} vinyl groups from the free monomers. Therefore, multiple unreacted pendent vinyl groups are introduced into the linear primary polymer chains, resulting in a high local/spatial vinyl concentration. As the chain grows, the propagating centre reacts with their own pendent vinyl groups to form intramolecular cyclized rings (i.e. intramolecular cyclization). The unique alternating chain propagation/intramolecular cyclization process eventually leads to the <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> cyclized/knotted polymer architecture.|$|E

25|$|Polymer {{properties}} are broadly divided into several classes {{based on the}} scale at which the property is defined as well as upon its physical basis. The most basic property of a polymer is the identity of its constituent monomers. A second set of properties, known as microstructure, essentially describe the arrangement of these monomers within the polymer at the scale of a <b>single</b> <b>chain.</b> These basic structural properties {{play a major role}} in determining bulk physical properties of the polymer, which describe how the polymer behaves as a continuous macroscopic material. Chemical properties, at the nano-scale, describe how the chains interact through various physical forces.

25|$|Every antimatroid can be {{represented}} as a join {{of a family of}} chain antimatroids, or equivalently as the closure of a set of basic words; the convex dimension of an antimatroid A is the minimum number of chain antimatroids (or equivalently the minimum number of basic words) in such a representation.

The paths of A belonging to a <b>single</b> <b>chain</b> antimatroid must form a chain in the path poset of A, so the convex dimension of an antimatroid equals the minimum number of chains needed to cover the path poset, which by Dilworth's theorem equals the width of the path poset.|$|E
25|$|Hypercycle theory {{proposed}} that hypercycles {{are not the}} final state of organization, and further development of more complicated systems is possible by enveloping the hypercycle {{in some kind of}} membrane. After evolution of compartments, a genome integration of the hypercycle can proceed by linking its members into a <b>single</b> <b>chain,</b> which forms a precursor of a genome. After that, the whole individualized and compartmentalized hypercycle can behave like a simple self-replicating entity. Compartmentalization provides some advantages for a system that has already established a linkage between units. Without compartments, genome integration would boost competition by limiting space and resources. Moreover, adaptive evolution requires the package of transmissible information for advantageous mutations in order not to aid less-efficient copies of the gene. The first advantage is that it maintains a high local concentration of molecules, which helps to locally increase the rate of synthesis. Secondly, it keeps the effect of mutations local, {{while at the same time}} affecting the whole compartment. This favours preservation of beneficial mutations, because it prevents them from spreading away. At the same time, harmful mutations cannot pollute the entire system if they are enclosed by the membrane. Instead, only the contaminated compartment is destroyed, without affecting other compartments. In that way, compartmentalization allows for selection for genotypic mutations. Thirdly, membranes protect against environmental factors because they constitute a barrier for high-weight molecules or UV irradiation. Finally, the membrane surface can work as a catalyst.|$|E
