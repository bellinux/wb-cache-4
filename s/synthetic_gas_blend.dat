40|$|This {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} obtain thermal energy from the combustion of <b>synthetic</b> <b>gas,</b> produced by the pyrolysis of insulating oil containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in a high temperature and high pressure reactor. The average <b>synthetic</b> <b>gas</b> generated was 59. 67 Am 3 /hr via the steady state gasification of insulating oil waste (20 kg/hr) with average concentrations (standard deviation) of CO 2, CO, and H 2 in the <b>synthetic</b> <b>gas</b> of 38. 63 ± 3. 11 %, 35. 18 ± 1. 93 %, and 28. 42 ± 1. 68 %, respectively. The concentrations of the PCBs in the transformer insulating oil and <b>synthetic</b> <b>gas</b> after its gasification, and the concentrations of the dioxins that could be produced from the incomplete degradation of PCBs were measured. It was revealed that the PCBs in the insulating oil were composed of the series from tetrachlorobiphenyl to octachlorobiphenyl. However, only the # 49, # 44, # 52, and # 47 / 75 / 48 congeners were detected from the <b>synthetic</b> <b>gas</b> after gasification of the insulating oil and in the flue gas from the combustor. In conclusion, the experimental con-ditions suggested {{in this study were}} very useful for the appropriate treatment of insulating oil containing PCBs. Also, fuel gas containing CO and H 2 can be obtained from the pyrolysis of insulating oil containing PCBs...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} short pulsing mixing interruptions on the Aspergillus niger R 3 {{morphology}} and fermentation performance was studied in 5 l agitated fermenters with double Rushton turbine impellers. A stable {{increase in the}} mycelia concentration and higher biomass concentrations {{at the end of}} the process were achieved in two continuous mixing fermentations, while in two fermentations with mixing interruptions biomass accumulation level was significantly lower. The highest citric acid concentration, in comparison with continuous mixing fermentations, was obtained in the pulsed on/off mixing fermentation with <b>gas</b> <b>blending,</b> and the pulsed mixing fermentation without <b>gas</b> <b>blending.</b> Small pellets (with about 0. 6 – 0. 8 mm mean equivalent diameter) developed in continuous mixing fermentations. The largest mean equivalent pellet diameter (approximately 0. 9 – 1. 1 mm) and the longest hyphae in the outer zone of a pellet were observed in the most productive fermentation with mixing oscillations accompanied by <b>gas</b> <b>blending...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Synthetic</b> natural <b>gas</b> (SNG) is {{suggested}} {{as an important}} future energy carrier. The conventional route for SNG production is based on gasification of biomass to <b>synthetic</b> <b>gas</b> and the subsequent methanation of <b>synthetic</b> <b>gas</b> to SNG. This study is aimed to analyze the process units using the concept of exergy. Exergy analysis is a promising method, based on the 2 nd law of thermodynamics, to analyze and improve chemical processes. In this work a detailed exergy analysis is performed for the SNG process based on woody biomass gasification. The main elements of the system are gasifier, <b>gas</b> cleaning, <b>synthetic</b> <b>gas</b> compression, methanation and final SNG condition. The above-mentioned process was simulated with a computer model using the flow-sheeting program Aspen Plus. Optimal values of the process conditions, particularly for the methanation reactors, are found. The internal exergy losses of different system units are evaluated. The largest internal exergy losses {{take place in the}} gasifier, methanation section and CO 2 capture unit. The highest overall exergetic efficiency of 72. 6 % was found applying the following operating conditions: gasifier 700 °C and 1 bar; 1 st methanation reactor 580 °C and 2 nd methanation reactor 405 °C. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R

40|$|A {{quarter of}} the total primary energy demand in the European Union is met by natural <b>gas.</b> <b>Synthetic</b> natural <b>gas</b> {{produced}} through biomass gasification can contribute to a more sustainable energy supply system. A chain analysis of the energetic performance of <b>synthetic</b> natural <b>gas</b> where the upstream, midstream and downstream part are included has not been found in literature. The energy performance of the possible large-scale application of <b>synthetic</b> natural <b>gas</b> is therefore unsure. A model was designed to analyse {{the performance of the}} biomass to <b>synthetic</b> natural <b>gas</b> chain and to estimate the effect of 1 % <b>synthetic</b> natural <b>gas</b> in the energy system. A break-even distance is introduced to determine whether it is energetically feasible to apply pretreatment. Results show that torrefaction and pelleting are energetically unfeasible within the European Union. Emissions can be reduced with almost 70 % compared to a fossil reference scenario. Over 1. 2 Mha is required to fulfil 0. 25 % of the total primary energy demand in the European Union...|$|R
