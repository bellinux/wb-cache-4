25|$|A common {{combination}} is gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS or GC-MS). In this technique, a gas chromatograph {{is used to}} separate different compounds. This stream of <b>separated</b> <b>compounds</b> is fed online into the ion source, a metallic filament to which voltage is applied. This filament emits electrons which ionize the compounds. The ions can then further fragment, yielding predictable patterns. Intact ions and fragments pass into the mass spectrometer's analyzer and are eventually detected.|$|E
50|$|The {{apparatus}} {{includes a}} U-shaped cell filled with buffer solution and electrodes immersed at its ends. The sample applied {{could be any}} mixture of charged components like a protein mixture. On applying voltage, the compounds will migrate to the anode or cathode depending on their charges. The change in the refractive index at the boundary of the <b>separated</b> <b>compounds</b> is detected using Schlieren optics {{at both ends of}} the solution in the cell.|$|E
50|$|Since {{different}} compounds {{will travel}} a different distance in the stationary phase, chromatography can in effect {{be used as}} an isolation technique. The <b>separated</b> <b>compounds</b> each occupying a specific area on the plate, they can be scraped away, put in another solvent to separate them from the stationary phase and used for further analysis. As an example, in the chromatography of an extract of green leaves (for example spinach) in 7 stages of development, Carotene elutes quickly and is only visible until step 2. Chlorophyll A and B are halfway in the final step and lutein the first compound staining yellow. Once the chromatography is over, the carotene can be removed from the plate, put back into a solvent and ran into a spectrophotometer to characterize its wavelength absorption.|$|E

5000|$|Camp Ruston {{was one of}} {{the largest}} prisoner-of-war camps in the United States during World War II, with 4,315 prisoners at its peak in October 1943. Camp Ruston served as the [...] "base camp" [...] and had 8 smaller work branch camps {{associated}} to it. Camp Ruston included three large, <b>separated</b> <b>compounds</b> for POWs, a full, modern hospital compound, and a compound for the American personnel. One of the POW compounds, located in the far northwestern part of the camp was designated for officers. The officer's compound's barracks were constructed to house a lesser number of POWs affording more privacy and room for the officers.

5000|$|The {{political}} scientist and historian Randall Hansen suggests that Rommel chose his whole command style {{for the purpose}} of spreading meritocracy and egalitarianism, as well as Nazi ideals he shared with Hitler due to their common non-aristocratic background. His egalitarianism extended to people of other races: in replying to white South African officers' demands that the black POWs should be housed in <b>separated</b> <b>compounds,</b> he refused, commenting that the black soldiers wore the same uniforms and had fought alongside the whites, and thus were their equals. On the other hand, Watson comments that, regarding the Afrika Korps, any Nazi indoctrination was minimised, allowing Rommel the freedom to reinvent his army in his own style. Rommel's proposals were not always practical: in 1943, he surprised Hitler by proposing that a Jew should be made into a Gauleiter to prove to the world that Germany was innocent of accusations that Rommel had heard from the enemy's propaganda regarding the mistreatment of Jews. Hitler replied [...] "Dear Rommel, you understand nothing about my thinking at all".|$|E
