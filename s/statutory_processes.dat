40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} {{traditional}} and <b>statutory</b> <b>processes</b> {{that were used}} to address child physical and sexual abuse in communities in Samoa. The study involved interviews with individuals from government departments, independent agencies, and groups from six villages. The methods included the review of case files of convicted cases, and legislation relevant to the abuse of children. The findings of the study indicate that child 'rights' is an issue that was perceived by participants beyond the wellbeing of the individual child. Children's rights were perceived by participants to have potential risks to collective existence and the preservation of Samoan traditional culture. Fundamental to the issue of rights was the conflict between local and state constitutions. The study found that rights were based on the country's constitution, were difficult to enforce in local communities where their own constitutions took precedent, based on customary rights and traditional social structures. The study provides some insights into traditional practices, societal structures, beliefs, values, and elements within <b>statutory</b> <b>processes</b> that make children vulnerable to abuse. The lack of clarity between the responsibilities of customary and state authorities sometimes made it unclear who was ultimately responsible for addressing crimes against children. The study pointed to the need for legislated protocols and a shared constitution between local customary and state authorities, in order to adequately address abuse. The thesis has implications for the social service sector, including judiciary processes. The thesis advocates for processes of 'justice' to make the safety and healing of children the priority, not the implementation of mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|Systems of {{political}} checks and balances, so prominently {{featured in the}} U. S. Constitution, are also commonly installed in statutory and regulatory regimes. Although such systems diffuse political authority and may facilitate participation and accountability, they come with a price. If exercised, political checks — even those that appear trivial — can obstruct <b>statutory</b> <b>processes</b> and saddle a policy system with an unintended default policy outcome. Policies that are neither debated nor chosen, but that emerge as unbidden defaults, exhibit the very democratic deficits that checks and balances are intended to remedy. This is precisely the situation of nuclear waste policy in the United States. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a process for siting and constructing repositories for nuclear waste. When Nevada’s Yucca Mountain emerged as a likely repository site, that state’s officials and allies exercised the numerous political and legal checks afforded by the Act and appear, {{at least for the}} time being, to have defeated the selection. But Nevada’s victory may well be the nation’s loss. In the absence of a national waste repository, nuclear power plant operators have no choice but to store spent nuclear fuel on site, where it presents a number of risks not contemplated by the 1982 legislation. This outcome was not chosen or anticipated by legislators, plant operators, state and local siting authorities, or host communities. This Article argues that lawmakers must take more realistic stock of their own institutional behaviors. Although certain corrosive incentives are intractably embedded in our constitutional system, lawmakers can and should write statutes with full awareness of the risks of relying on statutory checks and balances. In particular, legislators should assess carefully the default policy that will dictate outcomes when <b>statutory</b> <b>processes</b> fail...|$|E
40|$|Power is {{a dynamic}} that every {{mediation}} practitioner and academic will have confronted at some stage.

How mediators should attempt to deal with power differences and the impact of mediator interventions on both neutrality and the parties’ perceptions of the legitimacy of the process are fundamental issues of on-going concern. This article focuses attention on the increasing number of statutes in Australia and New Zealand that provide for the resolution of disputes by mediation and conciliation, and the ways that <b>statutory</b> <b>processes</b> address power differences between the parties. While the statutory examples are drawn from these jurisdictions, the power issues and statutory mechanisms will be pertinent in other jurisdictions...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 - 9, city planning in Australia has seen state governments embrace infrastructure packages to stimulate the economy. In particular, the delivery of social housing through the Social Housing Initiative (SHI) occurred through a fast-tracked method of planning. This represented {{a departure from the}} local <b>statutory</b> <b>processes,</b> which offer residents engagement opportunities and gave local government control of approving social housing construction in existing established areas of the city. This paper examines how government strategies to deliver social housing in difficult economic climates impacted upon democratic planning in Australian Cities. Reporting on recent AHURI research that compared local opposition to affordable housing projects in two States within the period of the Commonwealth Government&# 039;s Social Housing Initiative (2009 - 2012), this paper draws on semi-structured interviews with State and local government planners, housing providers and politicians in Victoria and New South Wales. These interviews show that government stimulus programs, whilst delivering essential infrastructure to cities in a quick and efficient manner, can lead to the re-politicisation of its delivery. Drawing upon the emerging literature on post-politics, this research suggests that locally democratic planning practices respond to national/state government intervention strategies in a variety of ways, which is changing the politics of social infrastructure delivery...|$|E

40|$|In a {{large number}} of states, women are {{encouraged}} to take their husbands’ surnames at marriage by being offered an expedited name-change process that is shorter, less expensive, and less invasive than the <b>statutory</b> <b>process</b> that men must complete. If a couple instead decides to take an altogether-new name at marriage, the vast majority of states require that each spouse complete the longer <b>statutory</b> <b>process.</b> This name-change system emerged from a long history of naming as a way for men to dominate women. This Note emphasizes the need for name-change reform, arguing that the current system perpetuates antiquated patriarchal values and violates the United States Constitution. By allowing both spouses to change their names on their marriage certificate without any legal incentive for choosing one name over another — an approach currently used by Minnesota, Iowa, and Massachusetts — states could effectively address these problems...|$|R
40|$|Long-term social {{processes}} are explored {{to examine the}} shaping of environmental education in eastern southern Africa. The study opens with early Nguni social figurations when 'to conserve was to hunt. ' It then examines colonial conservation on the frontiers of imperial expansion and developing struggles for and against wildlife preservation. These processes shaped an inversion of earlier harmonies as declining wildlife was protected in island sanctuaries of natural wilderness and 'to conserve was not to hunt. ' Inside protected areas, conservation management struggles shaped new harmonies of interdependence in nature, enabling better steering choices in developing conservation science institutions. Here more reality congruent knowledge also revealed escalating risk which was linked {{to a lack of}} awareness amongst communities of 'others' outside. Within continuing conservation struggles, education in, about and for the environment emerged as new institutional processes of social control. The study examines wilderness experience, interpretation, extension, conservancies and the development of an environmental education field centre, a teacher education programme and a school curriculum. Naming and clarifying the emergent education game for reshaping the awareness and behaviour of others is examined within a developing figuration of environmental education specialists. Particular attention is given to academic and <b>statutory</b> <b>processes</b> shaping environmental education as a field of objective principles and rational processes within modernist continuities and discontinuities into the 1990 's. An environmental education field centre, an earth-love curriculum and research on reserve neighbour interaction are examined as political sociologies developing within a declining power gradient and wide ranging socio-political change. Into the present, a final window on a local case of water pollution examines shifting relational dynamics revealing how environment and development education models of process may have little resonance amidst long-term socio-historical struggles and shifting controls over surroundings, others and self. A concluding review suggests that grounded critical processes engaging somewhat blind control over surroundings may yet reshape self-control and social control amongst others. The trajectories of these clarifying struggles must remain open-ended as sedimented myth and memory is reshaped within ongoing processes of escalating risk and global intermeshing...|$|E
40|$|The Kakanui River {{morphology}} and riparian {{management strategy}} has been prepared by Otago Regional Council (ORC), with input from the local community, to help protect the recreational, cultural and ecological values of the Kakanui and Kauru riverbeds, and to enable long-term, sustainable use of the land which borders the river. The strategy, as summarised in the two diagrams below, is intended to help achieve this by guiding work programs, decision-making and activities, for the community, stakeholders, and ORC. It is therefore recommended that people who live, work or play within the Kakanui catchment consider, and give effect to the principles, objectives, and actions listed in this strategy. The strategy is not a statutory document; rather {{it is intended to}} present the aspirations of the community and the various stakeholder agencies. However, the <b>statutory</b> <b>processes</b> which do influence river management activities 1 {{are more likely to be}} used effectively and efficiently if there is a general consensus on what is valued about the river, and commonly understood objectives. The strategy is intended to be a living document, which will evolve in response to new information, changes in the environment, the needs of the community and the work of ORC and other stakeholders. The strategy will be reviewed regularly, and this process will involve landowners with property alongside the river, other stakeholders and ORC, 2 and will help to set priorities and work programs for all of these groups. The strategy document will also record progress made towards achieving the stated objectives. It is intended that version 2 of the strategy will include further guidance and plans for undertaking planting on riparian margins, for river management purposes and for habitat enhancement. 1 Including the Local Government Act (in regards to funding considerations), and the Resource Management Act (in regards to managing environmental effects) 2 In particular, staff with responsibilities for rivers and waterway management and natural hazard...|$|E
40|$|This thesis uses an ethnographic {{study to}} {{interrogate}} the policy discourse of capturing ‘child voice’ specifically {{in relation to}} a ‘looked after’ child. In recent years, {{attempts have been made to}} involve children who are ‘looked after’ in discussions and decisions about their care arrangements to ensure that their voice is heard. To ensure this happens, children ‘in care’ are asked about their care placement regularly as part of the care planning review process and their views are incorporated into decisions about their care plan. This study focuses on the lived experiences of a seven-year old female child, who I have referred to as ‘Keeva’, who is ‘in care’ under a Kinship Care arrangement. Over a period of a year, I was based in Keeva’s home one afternoon a week to gain insights about her lived experience as a ‘looked after’ child and how she represented herself. I also observed three care planning review meetings to see how her voice was captured by those charged with her care and how she was represented. I relate Keeva’s experience through seven narrative episodes to capture the rich complexity of the social world she inhabits. I explore aspects of her home and family, her interactions with others and her experience of exploring physical spaces both inside and outside the home. I suggest that these experiences underpin her sense of self and how she relates to others. Drawing on the ideas of Bourdieu, I suggest these experiences and her sense of place in the social order write themselves ‘onto her’ through her habitus and dispositions. Using a Foucauldian lens, I problematise the notion of voice as I contest that the child I observed engaged fully in the <b>statutory</b> <b>processes</b> that surround her. I suggest Keeva, a child who is ‘looked after’, will neither have nor feel she has the agentive properties to influence the care planning process. Instead, as her voice is irrevocably bound up in a bureaucratic process that is uncritically accepted as representative of her, she is obscured as a consequence. I also examine the multivocity in representations of Keeva highlighting the competing discourses of safeguarding, child protection and the ’rights-based’ agenda. I conclude that Keeva was not well represented in care planning reviews and had very little influence in decision-making about her care plan. Despite believing the opposite, those charged with her care failed to hear her or take note of what she said. Furthermore, there was an absence of criticality in representations of Keeva allowing Keeva to be constructed by those professionals involved with her care, in an unchallenged way. As a consequence she was silenced and less visible than the process itself...|$|E
40|$|MSW, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Statutory {{social work}} is a mode of {{intervention}} within social work which poses many emotional and physical challenges to social workers. Social workers execute the implementing of the Children's Act (Act 38 of 2005) through the <b>statutory</b> removal <b>process</b> {{and they are the}} primary facilitators of this process. The goal of the <b>statutory</b> removal <b>process</b> is to protect children from abuse, neglect and exploitation by their biological parents or carers. Although research has been done previously about the experiences of social workers with regards to the <b>statutory</b> removal <b>process,</b> the research was limited to studies in America and England.
