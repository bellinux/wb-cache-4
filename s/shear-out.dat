40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the strength limit state of serial bolted connections in structural steel plates. It points out that the ultimate load capacity of a serial bolted connection failing in combined bearing and <b>shear-out</b> cannot be computed as the simple sum of the respective ultimate bearing and ultimate <b>shear-out</b> capacities, which is implicitly permitted in design specifications worldwide. Based on the laboratory test results of 10 hot-rolled steel plate specimens composed of three different grades with nominal thicknesses ranging from 5 to 8 mm, the paper first establishes the ultimate bearing coefficient of a 20 -mm bolted connection in a structural steel plate to be 3. 5. Coupled with the <b>shear-out</b> equation previously derived, a design equation where the <b>shear-out</b> capacity of the downstream bolt varying quadratically with the end distance is then proposed to determine the combined bearing and <b>shear-out</b> capacity. The proposed equation is demonstrated through verification against independent laboratory test results involving 5 -mm plates of three different grades to be significantly more accurate than the simple sum.

40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the {{mechanical}} behaviour and failure mode of Al 2024 -T 3 in double-lap bolted joints. To accomplish this, the effect of geometric parameters was investigated in both configurations of single and double fasteners. Using ABAQUS/Standard, a three-dimensional finite element model was developed and verified against the experimental results of the joints loaded in tension. In general, double bolt joints {{were found to have}} greater load carrying capacities than single bolt joints (by 40 %– 49 %). In single bolt joints, the plate width had insignificant effect on the behaviour of the joint under tensile loading; whereas, increasing the distance of the hole from the edge, considerably enhanced the strength of the joint. In double bolt joints, changing the edge distance had almost no effect on the behaviour of the joint. However, increasing the plate width from 25. 4 to 30 mm increased the load carrying capacity by 28 %. This study showed that in single bolt connections, with increasing the edge distance, the failure mode can favourably shift from <b>shear-out</b> to bearing. Also, double bolt joints with wider plates (increased width) can beneficially shift the failure mode from net-tension to bearing. The geometric parameters were found {{to play an important role}} in controlling the failure mode so that catastrophic failure modes of net-tension and <b>shear-out</b> can be prevented in bolted joint...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{is about the}} types of damage in pin loaded aluminum plate and mild steel plate. The experiment had done using various dimensions of the specimens by varying the edge distance to hole diameter ratio (E/D) and width size to hole diameter ratio (W/D). There are three types of mechanical joint failure that has been studied in this research which known as normal or net-tension failure, <b>shear-out</b> failure, and bearing failure. The specimens were tested using universal testing machine. The movement for upper crosshead of the testing machine will be stopped when the failure mode under investigation was seen on the specimen. For each specimen, the failure load was taken and determined from the load vs. displacement graph which is obtained from the computer that connects with the universal testing machine. The differences dimensions of the specimens give different value of failure load and some changing on the failure mode occurred on the specimens. Bearing failure which is preferred in this investigation due to less hazard and damage compared with normal and <b>shear-out</b> failure only occurred when W/D= 4 for aluminum plate and W/D equal to 3 and 4 for mild steel plate.

40|$|During normal {{assembly}} and disassembly of bolted-joint components, thread damage and/or deformation may occur. If threads are overloaded, thread damage/deformation {{can also be}} anticipated. Typical inspection techniques (e. g. using GO-NO GO gages) may not provide adequate visibility {{of the extent of}} thread damage. More detailed inspection techniques have provided actual pitch-diameter profiles of damaged-hardware holes. A method to predict the reduction in thread <b>shear-out</b> capacity of damaged threaded holes has been developed. This method was based on testing and analytical modeling. Test samples were machined to simulate damaged holes in the hardware of interest. Test samples containing pristine parent-holes were also manufactured from the same bar-stock material to provide baseline results for comparison purposes. After the particular parent-hole thread profile was machined into each sample a helical insert was installed into the threaded hole. These samples were tested in a specially designed fixture to determine the maximum load required to shear out the parent threads. It was determined from the pristine-hole samples that, for the specific material tested, each individual thread could resist an average load of 3980 pounds. The <b>shear-out</b> loads of the holes having modified pitch diameters were compared to the ultimate loads of the specimens with pristine holes. An equivalent number of missing helical coil threads was then determined based on the ratio of <b>shear-out</b> loads for each thread configuration. These data were compared with the results from a finite element model (FEM). The model gave insights into the ability of the thread loads to redistribute for both pristine and simulated damage configurations. In this case, it was determined that the overall potential reduction in thread load-carrying capability in the hardware of interest was equal to having up to three fewer threads in the hole that bolt threads could engage. One- half of this potential reduction was due to local pitch-diameter variations and the other half was due to overall pitch-diameter enlargement beyond Class 2 fit. This result was important in that the thread shear capacity for this particular hardware design was the limiting structural capability. The details of the method development, including the supporting testing, data reduction and analytical model results comparison will be discussed hereafter...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} provide the joint {{versatility}} for pultruded fibre reinforced polymer (PFRP) in civil structures industry is crucial for its application demands. Bolted joint is extensively used in the industry due to low cost and ease of assembly.

40|$|Stresses were {{calculated}} for finite size orthotropic laminates loaded by a frictionless steel pin in a circular hole of the same diameter. The calculations were based on finite element analyses for six laminates. Stress concentration factors, based on nominal bearing stress, were determined for wide ranges of the ratios of width to diameter, w/d and edge distance to diameter, e/d. An infinite laminate case was analyzed for each laminate. Orthotropy had a significant influence on the tensile stress concentration at the hole. For example, the stress concentration factors for the infinite laminate cases ranged from 0. 82 to 2. 16, compared with 0. 87 for the quasi-isotropic laminate. The finite widths and edge distances strongly influenced the tensile stress concentration. For the practical range w/d or = 3, the peak tensile stresses were as much as 80 % larger than the infinite laminate reference value.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the failure load and failure mode in an aluminum– glass-epoxy {{sandwich}} composite plate fastened mechanically by a bolt and washers on a circular hole under a preload exerted by a moment. Parametric studies were performed by experiments to find out the effects of joint geometry and preload moment on the failure strength and failure mode. The preload moments chosen (M) were 0, 3 and 6 Nm while the end distance to hole diameter (E/D) and width to diameter (W/D) ratios were chosen as 1 – 5 and 2 – 5, respectively. It is concluded from these experiments that the failure load increases with the increase ofM, E/D andW/D. WhenM, E/D and W/D ratios reach 3 – 6, 2 – 5 and 5 Nm, full bearing strengths occur, respectively. When E/D 1 for all the widths and preload moments, the <b>shear-out</b> failure mode is observed.

40|$|The {{two major}} classes of {{laminate}} joints are bonded and bolted. Often the two classes are combined as bonded-bolted joints. Several characteristics of {{fiber reinforced composite}} materials render them more susceptible to joint problems than conventional metals. These characteristics include weakness in in-plane shear, transverse tension/compression, interlaminar shear, and bearing strength relative to the strength and stiffness in the fiber direction. Studies on bolted joints of composite materials have been focused on joining assembly subject to in-plane loads. Modes of failure under these loading conditions are net-tension failure, cleavage tension failure, <b>shear-out</b> failure, bearing failure, etc. Although the studies of torque load {{can be found in}} literature, they mainly discussed the effect of the torque load on in-plane strength. Existing methods for calculating torque limit for a mechanical fastener do not consider connecting members. The concern that a composite member could be crushed by a preload inspired the initiation of this study. The purpose is to develop a fundamental knowledge base on how to determine a torque limit when a composite member is taken into account.

40|$|A new {{approach}} is developed for the analysis and design of mechanically fastened composite lap joints under mechanical and thermal loading. Based on the combined complex potential and variational formulation, the solution method satisfies the equilibrium equations exactly while the boundary conditions are satisfied by minimizing the total potential. This approach is capable of modeling finite laminate planform dimensions, uniform and variable laminate thickness, laminate lay-up, interaction among bolts, bolt torque, bolt flexibility, bolt size, bolt-hole clearance and interference, insert dimensions and insert material properties. Comparing to the finite element analysis, the robustness of the method does not decrease when modeling the interaction of many bolts; also, the method is more suitable for parametric study and design optimization. The Genetic Algorithm (GA), a powerful optimization technique for multiple extrema functions in multiple dimensions search spaces, is applied {{in conjunction with the}} complex potential and variational formulation to achieve optimum designs of bolted composite lap joints. The objective of the optimization is to acquire such a design that ensures the highest strength of the joint. The fitness function for the GA optimization is based on the average stress failure criterion predicting net-section, <b>shear-out,</b> and bearing failure modes in bolted lap joints. The criterion accounts for the stress distribution in the thickness direction at the bolt location by applying an approach utilizing a beam on an elastic foundation formulation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Damage {{characteristics}} of composite-skinned honeycomb sandwich panels in bending are investigated with both hemispherical (HS) and flat-ended (FE) indenters. The {{thickness of the}} cross-ply skins varies from 8 to 16 plies, whereas {{the density of the}} 12. 7 -mm thick aluminum honeycomb core varies from 50 to 70 kg/m 3. Clamped panels with a 100 -mm testing area are loaded quasi-statically either in bending or on a rigid base. The effects of varying these parameters on damage mechanisms are examined through response curves as well as cross sections of selected specimens. Special emphasis is placed on their potential change induced by the variation of skin thickness and core density with a specific indenter. Damage mechanisms are identified as core crush, top-skin delamination, and fracture or <b>shear-out.</b> The threshold and ultimate loads as well as the initial slope increase significantly either on increase of skin thickness or change of the nose shape of indenter from a hemisphere to a flat-end. The increase in the post-initial-damage slope is small and can be attributed to membrane stretching of the damaged top skin. Increasing the core density affects substantially not only the threshold load, but also the initial slope associated with the FE indenter. Changing the nose shape of the indenter has an overriding effect on the nature of damage mechanisms. In particular, top-skin delaminations occur after core crush. The panel deflection contributes to 20 – 53 % sandwich deformation. The bottom skin in all the tests remains intact.

40|$|Presented in {{this paper}} are test results for the {{determination}} of the pin-bearing strength of pultruded fibre reinforced polymer material required to calculate the bearing resistance of bolted connections under factored loading. It is well-known [1] that single-bolted and multi-bolted connections of pultruded material fail ultimately in a number of distinct failure modes (e. g. bearing, <b>shear-out,</b> cleavage, net-tension and block shear). Bearing {{is the only one of}} the mechanisms that does not give a brittle failure response, and can provide the connection with a degree of damage tolerance, which is desirable. The design calculation for bearing resistance is given by the projected area of bearing bolt times the specified bearing strength (Fbr) in the direction of the connection force, which is then multiplied by the number of bolts. In [2] a historical review on the determination of Fbr, is reported, and evaluated to show that there is a lack of consistency in how this strength has been measured, and much uncertainty on what values are to be taken in the resistance calculations. A comparison in [2] of pin-bearing strength measurements, based on the two test methodologies given in ASTM D 5764 [3] and BS EN ISO 13706 [4], showed that the ‘timber’ approach is suitable when there is a restriction on the size of coupon specimen that can be cut from a pultruded section. Presented are new test results for pin-bearing strengths when is equal to 0, 45 or 90 degrees, using the ‘timber’ approach. An evaluation of the data (with varying pin diameter-to-thickness ratio) is made with the aim of establishing how we establish a specified strength for the safe and reliable design of bolted connections...|$|E
40|$|A {{finite element}} model with {{three-dimensional}} solid elements was established to investigate the bearing failure of cold-formed steel bolted connections under shear. It was demonstrated (Chung and Ip. Engineering Structures 2000; 22 : 1271 - 1284) that the predicted load-extension curves of bolted connections in lap shear tests followed closely to the measured load-extension curves provided that measured steel strengths and geometrical dimensions {{were used in the}} analysis. Furthermore, it was shown (Chung and Ip. Proceedings of the Second European Conference on Steel Structures, Praha, May 1999, p. 503 - 506) that stress-strain curves, contact stiffnesses and frictional coefficients between element interfaces, and clamping forces developed in bolt shanks were important parameters for accurate prediction of the deformation characteristics of bolted connections. This paper presents an extension of the finite element investigation onto the structural behaviour of cold-formed steel bolted connections, and three distinctive failure modes (Ip and Chung. Proceeding of the Second International Conference on Advances in Steel Structures, Hong Kong, December 1999) as observed in lap shear tests are successfully modelled: bearing failure; <b>shear-out</b> failure; and net-section failure. Furthermore, a parametric study on bolted connections with different configurations is performed to provide bearing resistances for practical design, and the results of the {{finite element model}}ling are also compared with four codified design rules. It is found that the design rules are not applicable for bolted connections with high strength steels due to reduced ductility. Consequently, a semiempirical design formula for bearing resistance of bolted connections is proposed after calibrating against finite element results. The proposed design rule relates the bearing resistances with the design yield and tensile strengths of steel strips through a strength coefficient. It is demonstrated that the design rule is applicable for bolted connections of both low strength and high strength steels with different ductility limits.

Yokes need to be rigid and sufficiently flexible to survive many blade flexing and revolutions. To understand and improve the fatigue life of rotor yoke, a flexural fatigue behavior study was done on the thick glass/epoxy laminate with bolted holes through the thickness. 80 plies unidirectional and cross-ply specimens were manufactured by hand lay-up. The effect of debulking process was discussed. A suitable bagging and curing procedure was used to achieve uniform and acceptable thick glass/epoxy laminates for mechanical tests. The unidirectional and cross-ply specimens were tested on a clamped-clamped fatigue bending fixture. For each of the stacking sequences, test specimens were subjected to four deflection levels. All flexural fatigue tests were conducted under displacement control at 3 Hz, with an R-ratio of 0. 1 (single sided bending). Thermography was used to record the surface temperature increase, focusing on the crack initiation area. A crack was detected by four ways: sound, visual observation, load drop and thermography. Thermography was found to be an effective in-situ delamination detection method. A 20 % reduction of initial load was taken as failure. The cross-ply specimens initiated delaminations more easily than unidirectional specimens. However, the cross-ply specimens had slower crack propagation rate. The unidirectional specimens did not initiate delaminations (at same thickness position) but had <b>shear-out</b> cracks (at different thickness positions) at displacements lower than 20 mm. The fatigue lives were up to 1 E 6 cycles. When subjected to the displacement lower than 21 mm, the cross-ply specimens had fatigue life up to 1 E 6 cycles.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{mechanical}} behaviour of 2 -bolt single-lap CFRP joints with countersunk bolts is investigated, both numerically and experimentally. A detailed 3 D non-linear FE model of composite bolted joints has been developed. The model replicates with good agreement the experimental tensile tests {{up to the}} point where bearing damage occurs and reproduces the joint behaviour correctly. Five stages are identified in the joint behaviour. The evolution of contact during the test is studied showing a correlation with the joint stiffness. Parametric studies investigate the influence of bolt clamping force, coefficient of friction and bolt-hole clearance on the joint behaviour. Using the developed FE model, the distribution of the six stress components around the holes of the composite joints is studied together with the effects of head height, shank-hole clearance and position of bolts. The stress along the fibres is identified as the critical stress component and the compressive fibre failure of the 0 ° oriented plies as the start of the bearing damage. The 0 ° oriented plies in the cylindrical part of the hole are found to be the plies carrying the bearing load. Increasing clearance reduces the extent of the bolt shank-hole contact and leads to higher stresses and lower joint stiffness. The 45 ° and - 45 ° oriented plies are found to have {{a key role in the}} joint bearing strength and <b>shear-out</b> failure. Fatigue tests are run with the introduction of a novel method to monitor the loss of clamping force and detect crack initiation in the fasteners during the test itself, using strain gauges and a real-time algorithm. The clamping force is found to remain constant until crack initiation and progressively drop until final failure. Load transfer and interaction between the bolts is observed during the fast but stable fatigue crack propagation. The fatigue tests are conducted on joints with differing plate thicknesses and countersunk head geometries to assess the influence of these on the number of cycles to crack initiation and to final failure. A link between fatigue and static test results is highlighted and, in addition, a fatigue failure mechanism of the joint is proposed. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} model is developed to study the behavior of single- and double-bolted timber connections with relatively low member thickness-to-fastener diameter ratios. These structural joints tend to fail in a brittle fashion. The established model is capable of predicting the post-elastic deformations of the connections locally and globally, and the unequal load fractions transferred by each bolt in a two-fastener connection. The ADINA software package is used to generate the model. The problem presents two types of non-linearity. The first is due to geometric effects caused by increased sliding contact between the bolts and the oversized holes in the wood member. Contact is simulated using the Lagrange Multiplier algorithm available in ADINA. This algorithm enforces the compatibility of surface displacements at the wood member which is the contactor surface, and Coulomb frictional conditions over the contact segments, with a coefficient of friction of 0. 7. The second non-linearity results from the material post-elastic behavior adjacent to the contact points. A plasticity-based compressive constitutive material model is developed to represent wood as elasto-plastic orthotropic according to the Hill yield criterion in regions of bi-axial compression. Linear elastic orthotropic response is applied otherwise. The model is incorporated as a user-supplied material model of ADINA {{to carry out the}} analysis. The performance of the program and the effectiveness of the elasto-plastic material model are first verified with examples from the literature. Thereafter, numerical simulations of the post-elastic deformations of one- and two-bolt connections are compared to experimental results from tensile tests undertaken on glued-laminated timber connections with stocky bolts and subject to monotonic loading. Characterization tests are undertaken to obtain stiffness and strength for compression and tension parallel and perpendicular to grain, and shear, required as input in the new material model. Five configurations of single-bolt connections and four configurations of double-bolt connections have been tested with different combinations of end distance, edge distance, and spacing between bolts. Reasonable agreement is found between numerical and experimental load vs. strains obtained using single axis strain gages and strain rosettes mounted in regions of stress concentrations. The model is capable of tracing the post-elastic global deformation as obtained from experimental load vs. displacements of LVDT's mounted on specimens. The non-linearity of these load-slip curves is primarily caused by the inelastic wood deformation beneath the bolts at low load levels. This behavior explains the redistribution of load proportions among the bolts in a double-bolt connection. Under test configurations forces are unequally shared between the bolts even at the ultimate load. As a consequence, joint capacity as estimated with the proposed elasto-plastic material model is bounded by the so-called European Yield Model, which assumes equal load distribution among the bolts at ultimate, and the linear elastic model. Observed <b>shear-out</b> brittle failures of wood bolted connections are believed to be caused by excessive combined shear and tension perpendicular to grain along the sides of the contact zone...|$|E
