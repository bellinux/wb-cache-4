It also has first and second charge storage elements. A first <b>switch</b> <b>unit</b> has a first switch state in which {{the first and second}} charge storage elements are charged in dependence on an input current. The first <b>switch</b> <b>unit</b> has a second switch state in which the first and second capacitors are decoupled from the current input and the first capacitor is decoupled from the second capacitor and the output. The arrangement also has a second <b>switch</b> <b>unit</b> with a first switch state in which the charge of the second capacitor is provided at the output, and a second switch stat in which the second capacitor is decoupled from the output.

40|$|This barchelor {{thesis is}} about Desig an {{automated}} workplace forchargeable and high-impedant measurements. This automated workplace is realized by tubular aspiration capacitor, which is connected via differential converter U/I to data acquisition <b>switch</b> <b>unit</b> HP 34970 A. The data acquisition <b>switch</b> <b>unit</b> HP 34970 A is also connected by serial line RS- 232 to Computer (PC), {{on which the}} directed program Agilent VEE Pro 7. 0 is installed. To the right connection data acquisition <b>switch</b> <b>unit</b> HP 34970 A and PC is necessary to set the same parameters on data acquisition <b>switch</b> <b>unit</b> HP 34970 A, such in I/O config and also in Instrument manager too. In Instrument manager is requisite to set Plug und Play driver for data acquisition <b>switch</b> <b>unit</b> HP 34970 A. The programing in Agilent VEE Pro 7. 0 is based on object oriented programming. To start the program press the button “START“ and automatic measuring of concentration air ionts, will start the process (the trend is marked to the graph). The program is indicated if the ventilator blows an air in the aspiration capacitor and draws the trend of voltage on this ventilator to the graph. To stop the program press the buton “STOP“. Measured data are exported to program Excel. For the export Excel has to be running before the process. The function is verifing by measuring of background negativ a positiv ionts, by influence of position the source of ionts behind the aspiration capacitor and by influence of materials (metal plate, paper carton, wood, conductive paint) to the concentration of negativ ionts...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a novel method which allows the serial {{connection}} of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs). The different dynamic characteristics of serially connected IGBTs during turn ON and OFF cause a short-term overvoltage stress in the transistors. In contrary to the commonly used techniques, the presented method reduces additional commutation losses by actively correcting turn ON and OFF delays. The presented method uses overvoltages as measured by a peak detector. The correction circuit doesn't require a high speed Analog-Digital converter (ADC) or high speed computation. The target power <b>switch</b> <b>unit</b> consists of two serial connected transistors with two identical parallel branches. The wellknown 2 -level inverter topology equipped with the power <b>switch</b> <b>unit</b> can be connected directly to the high-voltage grid. This converter topology was demanded by our industry partner for 11 MW mining machines.

Due to their mobility on the Au(111) surface at room temperature, the molecules spontaneously formed self-organized molecular arrangements that reflected their chemical structure. While lateral displacement of the molecules was accomplished by manipulation, trans–cis isomerization processes, typical for azobenzene switches, could not be induced...|$|R
