25|$|Walt Disney, {{the owner}} of the Carolwood Pacific Railroad, always had a great passion for trains. As a young boy, he wanted to become a train {{engineer}} like his father's cousin, Mike Martin, who told him stories about his experiences driving main-line trains on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. In addition, Disney's father would occasionally share his experiences from when he was part of a track installation crew for the Union Pacific Railroad. As a teenager, Disney obtained a news butcher job on the Missouri Pacific Railway, selling various products to train passengers, including newspapers, candy, and cigars. He would sometimes climb over the tender and into the locomotive's cab while the train was in motion, and, using chewing tobacco as a bribe, the engineer and fireman would <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> to operate the locomotive. Many years later, after co-founding the Walt Disney Company with his older brother Roy O. Disney, he started playing polo. Fractured vertebrae and other injuries led him to abandon the sport on the advice of his doctor, who recommended a calmer recreational activity. Starting in late 1947, he developed an interest in model trains after purchasing several Lionel train sets.|$|E

While on the train, Harry meets two fellow first years, Ron Weasley, who {{immediately}} becomes his friend, and Hermione Granger, with whom the ice is a bit slower to break. [...] Harry also makes an enemy of yet another first-year, Draco Malfoy. Draco offers to advise Harry, but Harry dislikes Draco for his arrogance and prejudice and rejects his offer of [...] "friendship".|$|E
500|$|The gender-swapped {{version of}} Marceline—named Marshall Lee—appeared {{in the third}} season episode [...] "Fionna and Cake". This version of the {{character}} only had a small cameo and no lines. It was later revealed that another Fionna and Cake episode was {{in the works for}} season five, and that the plot would largely revolve around Marshall Lee. The episode—titled [...] "Bad Little Boy"—aired on February 18, 2013. In the episode, the princesses that are captured by the Ice King are tired of his poorly written Fionna and Cake fan fiction stories, so Marceline stops by the Ice Kingdom to <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> to do it properly; she tells a tale involving her gender-swapped character, Marshall Lee. The character was voiced by comedian and musician Donald Glover. Additionally, Marshall Lee makes a cameo appearance in the third Fionna and Cake episode entitled [...] "The Prince Who Wanted Everything", and has a speaking role in the fourth entitled [...] "Five Short Tables".|$|E

500|$|When Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) {{moves into}} Ramsay Street, she {{immediately}} catches Rhys' eye. He later treats {{her when she}} is admitted to hospital with severe morning sickness. Rhys believes {{the father of her}} child, Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major), is not [...] "pulling his weight" [...] and he starts looking out for her. Rhys helps Vanessa lift some heavy boxes and she offers to <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> to bake a cake to say thank you. A columinst for All About Soap observed [...] "While Vanessa sees it as mates having fun, it's clear Rhys has got it bad!" [...] Rhys later returns {{to spend more time with}} Vanessa, which unnerves Lucas. Herbison commented that Rhys may have met his match in Vanessa, while Barber said her feistiness appeals to him. He stated [...] "He finds her attractive, and she takes the mickey out of him - that's good for Rhys. He needs to be knocked off his pedestal! Vanessa also exposes a rare vulnerability in Rhys, so there's a risk he could get hurt and lash out in other ways." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions, the raven was {{the first}} animal to be {{released}} from Noah's Ark. [...] "So it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth. He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded {{from the face of the}} ground." [...] The raven is mentioned a dozen times in the Bible. In the New Testament Jesus tells a parable using the raven to show how people should rely on God for their needs and not riches (...) [...] The raven is also mentioned in Quran at the story of Cain and Abel. Adam's firstborn son Cain kills his brother Abel but he doesn't know what to do with the corpse: [...] "Then Allah sent a raven scratching up the ground, to <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> to hide his brother's naked corpse. He said: Woe unto me! Am I not able to be as this raven and so hide my brother's naked corpse? And he became repentant." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} time in any of his works {{involving}} amateurs, Britten envisaged a large complement of child performers among his orchestral forces, led by what Graham described as [...] "the professional stiffening" [...] of a piano duet, string quintet (two violins, viola, cello and bass), recorder and a timpanist. The young musicians play a variety of instruments, including a full string ensemble with each section led {{by a member of the}} professional string quintet. The violins are further divided into parts of different levels of difficulty, from the simplest (mostly playing open strings) to those able to play in third position. The recorders should be led by an accomplished soloist able to flutter-tongue; bugles, played in the original production by boys from a local school band, are played as the children representing animals march into the ark, and at the climax of the opera. The child percussionists, led by a professional timpanist, play various exotic and invented percussion instruments: the score itself specifies sandpaper ("two pieces of sandpaper attached to blocks of wood and rubbed together"), and [...] "Slung Mugs", the latter used to represent the first drops of rain. Britten originally had the idea of striking teacups with a spoon, but having failed to make this work, he sought Imogen Holst's advice. She recalled that [...] "by great good fortune I had once had to teach Women's Institute percussion groups during a wartime 'social half hour', so I was able to take him into my kitchen and <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> a row of china mugs hanging on a length of string could be hit with a large wooden spoon.|$|E

2500|$|The amplified {{stringed}} instruments, {{especially the}} steel guitar, gave the music its distinctive sound. As early as 1934 or 1935 Bob Dunn electrified a Martin O-series acoustic guitar while playing with Milton Brown's Brownies. According to Jimmy Thomason, [...] "It happened when Dunn {{was working at}} Coney Island in New York...he ran into this black guy who was playing a steel guitar with a homemade pickup attached to it...hooked up to this old radio or something and was playing blues licks...and he got this guy to <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he was doing it.

2500|$|In 1986, his 24 wins helped {{guide the}} Red Sox to a World Series berth and earned Clemens the American League MVP {{award for the}} regular season. Clemens started in the All-Star Game and was named the Most Valuable Player for {{throwing}} three perfect innings and striking out two. He also won {{the first of his}} seven Cy Young Awards. When Hank Aaron said that pitchers should not be eligible for the MVP, Clemens responded: [...] "I wish he were still playing. I'd probably crack his head open to <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> valuable I was." [...] Clemens was the only starting pitcher since Vida Blue in [...] to win a league MVP award until Justin Verlander won the award in [...]|$|E

2500|$|Seppmann {{was not a}} farmer, so to {{test the}} {{finished}} mill he had to borrow money and buy grain. [...] As the American Civil War was still raging, grain was quite expensive and the bank charged him 25% interest in advance for his loan. [...] Seppmann also needed to hire an expert to start up the mill and <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> to operate it. [...] However, there was no wind {{for four or five}} weeks and the expert eventually gave up and went home. [...] The first light wind didn't blow until a Sunday, but Seppmann was opposed to working on the Sabbath until his partner Hegley convinced him that if God had provided the first wind in over a month on a Sunday it must be okay.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to another}} tradition, the devil {{appeared}} to Cain and instructed {{him how to}} exact revenge on Abel. [...] "Hit Abel's head with a stone and kill him", whispered the devil to Cain. After the murder, the devil hurried to Eve shouting: [...] "Eve! Cain has murdered Abel!". Eve {{did not know what}} murder was or how death felt like. She asked, bewildered and horrified, [...] "Woe to you! What is murder?". [...] "He [...] does not eat. He does not drink. He does not move [...] ", answered the Devil. Eve burst out into tears and started to wail madly. She ran to Adam and tried to tell him what happened. However, she could not speak because she could not stop wailing. Since then, women wail brokenheartedly when a loved one dies. A different tradition narrates that while Cain was quarreling with Abel, the devil killed an animal with a stone in Cain's sight to <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> to murder Abel.|$|E
2500|$|Confident in his skill, Mannock {{arrived in}} France on 31 March 1917 at 40 Squadron {{headquarters}} near Aire, Lens. He {{did not give}} his new squadron-mates a good first impression. On his first night he inadvertently {{sat down in the}} chair of a popular pilot killed that day and proceeded to ask pilots about their personal scores and offer, without invitation, his own views on air combat. Lieutenant Lionel Blaxland recalled; [...] "He seemed a boorish know-all, we all felt the quicker he got amongst the Huns the better; that would <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> little he knew." [...] Mannock flew the squadrons Nieuport 17 scout the following day. As the days passed, he preferred to remain airborne by virtue of his squadron's hostility. The public school boy-dominated squadron detested his [...] "gutter politics" [...] and mannerisms although Mannock was befriended by Irishman Lieutenant de Burgh, of the same ilk. Mannock would forge friendships with new pilots. George McElroy arrived in September and became Mannock's protégé.|$|E
