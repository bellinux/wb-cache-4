40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "All-terrain vehicles (ATV), which are off-road motorized vehicles, usually with four tires, a <b>straddle</b> <b>seat</b> for the operator, and handlebars for steering control, have become increasingly popular. However, ATV fatalities and injuries have increased {{over the last decade}} and are a matter of concern to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission), which oversees ATV safety, and to others. Many ATV crashes involving children occur when they are riding adult-sized ATVs. Manufacturers and distributors have agreed to use their best efforts to prevent their dealers from selling adult-sized ATVs for use by {{children under the age of}} 16. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act requires GAO to report on (1) how ATVs are used and the advantages of their use and (2) the nature, extent, and costs of ATV crashes. GAO addressed these topics by reviewing ATV use and crash data and by discussing these issues with Commission staff, industry officials, user groups, and safety stakeholders. ...|$|E
50|$|In October 2010 {{a faster}} Excitor III was introduced. The 12.5m Naiad rigid hull {{inflatable}} vessel carried up to 35 passengers {{at up to}} 50 knots, powered by 4 x 300 hp V8 engines. Built by Whangarei-based Circa Marine, and specifically designed for conditions in the Bay of Islands, the new Excitor featured <b>straddle</b> <b>seats,</b> an ultra modern low wake hull design and a retractable set of stairs built into the bow {{to allow her to}} service any beach in the Bay of Islands. In January and March 2011, passengers were injured in incidents on the boat and Maritime New Zealand stopped the boat operating.|$|R

50|$|The Pony Express {{was one of}} {{the first}} of its kind to be built in the United States. It is based on a new design called a cycle coaster, most popularly {{manufactured}} by Zamperla, a roller coaster and attraction company centered in Vicenza, Italy. Riders <b>straddle</b> the <b>seats</b> like a motorcycle or a bicycle, hence the name cycle coaster. Unlike most coasters, the ride doesn't use potential energy attained from ascending a hill via chain lift. Instead, the ride uses a flywheel and clutch system that catches a cable attached to the cars and delivers stored rotational energy, launching riders from 0 to 38 miles per hour down a straight launch track in less than 3 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|In late 2004, Simonetti was {{suspended}} [...] and then fired [...] after Delta Air Lines objected to Ellen posing for photographs on a company airplane and commentary on her blog. [...] Simonetti subsequently renamed her blog [...] "Diary of a Fired Flight Attendant." [...] Although Simonetti never mentioned Delta Airlines by name, {{the photos of}} her in uniform and the cabin clearly indicated the airline that she worked for. In addition, some of the blog content was deemed inappropriate such as her suggestive poses, including one photo where her legs were <b>straddling</b> the <b>seat</b> headrests with her skirt hiked up, and another where her shirt was unbuttoned to reveal her bra and some cleavage.|$|R
2500|$|The simple, flat-sided {{fuselage}} was a steel-tube {{structure with}} four longerons, linked by welded struts, defining the shape.

50|$|Early in 2010, {{the company}} {{revealed}} a non-functioning show {{model of the}} C-1. The design vision showcased an enclosed two-wheeled vehicle self-balanced by two single-gimbal control moment gyroscopes, to be powered by lithium iron phosphate batteries. Design specifications indicated that it could hold a second passenger, though no model or pictures other than computer renderings showed more than single-passenger capacity. Computer renderings of a two passenger model indicate that the tight space would likely not be suitable for long trips, as the area behind the driver's seat is very limited, in a semi-reclined position, with legs <b>straddling</b> the front <b>seat.</b>|$|R

Each rider's seat is shaped like a horse, and the rider <b>straddles</b> the saddle <b>seat</b> to create the feeling that they are riding on a horse. An automated restraint system secures the rider in their seat, pressing against his/her lower back, allowing the upper body to move fairly freely.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{assessment}} of motor abilities on {{the sample of}} 164 subjects of boys from major cities of Vojvodina, divided in three groups according to their IQ. Assessment {{was carried out by}} the test battery of 7 motor tests: Obstacle course backwards, Hand tapping, <b>Seated</b> <b>straddle</b> stretch, Standing broad jump, 20 m run, Sit-up, Bent-arm hang, as well as by Raven's progressive matrices in color for assessment of cognitive abilities. Subject of this paper are motor and cognitive abilities of boys at the age of 7 - 10. The purpose of research is to define differences in motor abilities of children at different intellectual levels. Significance of this research is primarily related to getting concrete data on engagement of cognitive abilities in performing motor tasks of different complexity. Research results of the above sample indicated that coordination seven to eight years old boys had statistical significant relations with cognitive abilities, hence motor tasks i. e. tasks of unusual structure to be carried out fast and correctly, which represented these abilities took effect on differences between groups, whereas repetitive strength, static strength and flexibility did not significantly affect the difference between groups...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} cognitive and motor status factors in female and male children aged 10 – 14, as well as developmental and/or integration functions according to gender. The study included 162 girls and 134 boys aged 10 – 14, divided into four groups: 84 girls aged 10 – 12 (mean age 11. 26, SD 0. 68), 84 boys aged 10 – 12 (mean age 11. 41, SD 0. 50), 78 girls aged 13 – 14 (mean age 13. 52, SD 0. 63) and 50 boys aged 13 – 14 (mean age 13. 21, SD 0. 53). The significance of quantitative differences between boys and girls in the overall system of variables was defined based on the results of canonic discriminant analysis of variance, and within each variable based on the results on univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the younger age group (10 – 12 years), girls were superior to boys in a test assessing flexibility (<b>Seated</b> <b>straddle</b> stretch), whereas, compared to girls, boys had greater strength of the trunk (Crossed-arm sit-ups), greater explosive strength of jump and sprint type (Standing broad jump and 20 m dash), and coordination (Obstacle course backwards and Steps laterally). In the older age group (13 – 14 years) differences in flexibility were even more prominent in favor of girls, whereas the differences in explosive strength increased in favor of boys, especially of the throwing type with better agility (Steps laterally), balance (Board balance) and greater static strength of arms and shoulders (Bent-arm hang). In order to determine qualitative differences between pubertal and prepubertal girls and boys, the matrix of variable inter-correlations was factorized by the procedure of principal components procedure, that were then transformed to promax solution. The results showed that cognitive functioning had a significant role in the motor efficacy of girls and boys aged 10 to 14. In the age group of 10 – 12 years, in females, cognitive functioning is related to the motor system which integrates the regulation of muscle tone with agility/coordination, whereas in males there is a relation between cognitive abilities and the regulator of speed of upper extremities movement frequency. In the age group of 13 – 14 years, in females, cognitive functioning is involved in forming the factors for regulation of coordination and the intensity of energy mobilization in lower extremities, and to some degree, in the factor for regulation of intensity of energymobilization in upper extremities and strength of the trunk, whereas in males the integration of synergetic regulation of movement in terms of balance and agility in terms of speed of direction change is carried out with significant involvement of cognitive abilities...|$|R
