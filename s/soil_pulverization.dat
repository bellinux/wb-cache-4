40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{effects of}} <b>soil</b> <b>pulverization</b> level on {{mechanical}} properties of a lime stabilized high plasticity clay were investigated. Unconfined compression strength tests were carried on lime stabilized samples which were prepared with two different <b>soil</b> <b>pulverization</b> levels. Fine <b>soil</b> <b>pulverization</b> consisted of 100 % finer than No. 4 sieve, as typical of laboratory applications. Coarse <b>soil</b> <b>pulverization</b> consisted of 60 % {{of the soil}} passing No. 4 sieve and all finer than 20 mm, as typical of a high quality field gradation. 4 %, 6 % and 9 % hydrated lime were used by dry weight of the soil for soil stabilization. Unconfined compression tests were carried out after 7, 28 and 56 days of curing. The results revealed that stress-strain behavior differed with <b>soil</b> <b>pulverization</b> levels. Unconfined compression strength and initial modulus values were also significantly affected by <b>soil</b> <b>pulverization</b> levels. Coarse pulverized samples had considerably inferior unconfined compression strength and initial elastic modulus values. This was valid for all curing days. The ratio of values obtained for fine and poor <b>soil</b> <b>pulverization</b> ranged between 1, 5 to 2 for unconfined compression strength values and was about 1, 5 for initial elastic modulus values. These differences may cause discrepancies between laboratory-estimated and actual field performances of the pavements. It should also be recalled that, in case, field soil gradations are coarser than that of this study, the differences may be larger. Therefore {{based on the results}} of this study, it is recommended that laboratory testing for mixture design of lime stabilized soils should be carried out with probable field gradations...|$|E
40|$|Farmers try {{to reduce}} steps of soil {{preparation}} by using subsoiler and then following by equipment for <b>soil</b> <b>pulverization</b> such as a rotary tiller and a power harrow which take advantage of using a power take-off of a tractor. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to compare the tilling performances of a rotary tiller and a power harrow applying after subsoiling. The results showed that both the rotary tiller and the power harrow had negative slip, indicating that they generated force to push a tractor. The rotary tiller created negative vertical force to lift up the tractor whereas opposite result was found when using the power harrow. Since working depths were different, vertical forces, torques and PTO powers for two equipment types were significantly different. However, {{no significant differences were found}} for the forward speeds, slips, drawbar pulls and drawbar powers. Comparative analysis showed that two equipment types had significant difference in PTO power to working depth, drawbar power to working depth, PTO power to working area, drawbar power to working area and <b>soil</b> <b>pulverization...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{three levels of}} soil {{moisture}} content (10 - 12, 13 - 15 and 16 - 18 % d. b.) and three levels of plowing depth (15, 20 and 25 cm) on draft, specific draft, and drawbar power requirements of a 3 - bottom disk plow and on <b>soil</b> <b>pulverization</b> and inversion in a clay loam soil were investigated. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with a 3 × 3 factorial. Except in soil inversion, the effect of soil moisture {{on all of the}} performance parameters mentioned, was highly significant. Mean values of draft, specific draft and drawbar power requirements and clod mean weight diameter were minimized at 13 - 15 % and 16 - 18 % soil moisture contents, respectively. The effect of plowing depth was highly significant only on draft and drawbar power requirement of disk plow, {{in such a way that}} the mean values of these two parameters were significantly increased with plowing depth, while specific draft showed only a mild decreasing trend. In order to provide a quantitative index to express the degree of <b>soil</b> <b>pulverization</b> by tillage implements, a tractor-pulled rotary sieve was designed and fabricated. With this apparatus, in-field determination of soil clod mean weight diameter (MWD) following plowing was possible. The results showed that the effect of soil moisture content on MWD was highly significant, such that, plowing at 10 - 12 % moisture content produced the largest clods, whereas the effect of plowing depth on MWD was not significant. The decreasing trend of MWD with soil moisture content persisted to the highest moisture level studied (16 - 18 %), in which the average clod MWD (33. 8 mm) was about 72 % smaller than those formed at 10 - 12 % moisture content. The effects of plowing depth and soil m. c. on soil inversion by disk plow were not significant and the overall soil inversion was about 54 % which was in agreement with those reported by other researchers...|$|E
40|$|Grain-size {{data are}} {{presented}} for Apollo- 17 soils, {{and the relationship}} is considered between grain-size distribution and the processes which pulverize the soil, reconstitute it as agglutinates, and replenish it with fresh material. It is shown that a strong inverse correlation exists between mean grain size and standard deviation {{and that there is}} a correlation between grain size and agglutinate content whereby the finest samples have the highest agglutinate content. Two evolutionary sequences are described for the soils in which (1) reworking by micrometeorites predominates over mixing with other soils and (2) mixing predominates over reworking. It is shown that the final result of soil evolution may be a steady-state <b>soil</b> where <b>pulverization</b> by micrometeorites is balanced by agglutination and replenishment of coarser grains. A model is presented for such a soil, and it is argued that its grain-size distribution may depend on regolith thickness. ...|$|R
40|$|Low {{efficiency}} and substandard machines are common problems in agricultural mechanization in most developing countries. In this paper, a prototype non-power rotary tiller implement (NPRT) {{was developed to}} pulverize soils after first plowing for seedbed preparation. Field performance of NPRT, power rotary tiller (PRT) and traditional comb tooth harrow (CTH) were compared. Results showed that highest pulverization was attained by PRT due to higher power transmitted directly from the engine to the rotary blades. Soil water content and bulk density were inversely proportional with tillage passes in all tested implements. PRT attained highest temperature diurnal wave than NPRT and CTH on soil surface and highly affected as the ambient temperature changes due to porous and looseness of the <b>soil.</b> <b>Pulverization</b> and mixing of clods had maximized the exposure of the lower layers to solar radiation and evaporation process and reducing soil moisture and bulk density...|$|E
40|$|Conservation tillage {{practices}} have replaced traditional plowing and conventional seedbed tillage in some dry areas in Western Canada and the USA. The planter or seed drill {{is an important}} piece of equipment used in crop production systems. Because of time constraints and large cropped areas, high-speed seeding operations are desirable. However, the increased draft and power requirements associated with high operating speeds are major factors limiting the speeds at which it is feasible to use tillage tools. Dynamic effects on soil-tool cutting forces are important when operating at elevated speeds. The rate-dependent behaviour of narrow tillage tools was investigated in this study. A 9 -m long linear monorail system was developed to carry narrow tools through a linear soil bin at high speeds. Steady-state speeds from 0. 5 to 10. 0 m/s over 1 to 3 m were attained using this system. The performance of tools with rectangular, triangular and elliptical cross sections were studied. Experimental measurements showed a linear increase of draft with increasing operating speed, for all tool shapes. Power input per operating depth and <b>soil</b> <b>pulverization</b> also increased {{with an increase in}} tool speed. Elliptical, triangular and flat tool shapes presented the lowest to highest draft requirements, respectively. A hypoelastic soil constitutive relationship with variable Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio was developed to describe the dynamic soil-tool cutting problem. Inertial effects were initially included in the stiffness matrix; however, doing this introduced numerical oscillations, even for small tool displacements (...|$|E
40|$|Influence of {{existing}} methods and technologies of soil processing for forest crops on establishment {{and growth of}} cultivated tree species was studied. It was found that furrow plough processing of soil can interfere with the cultivated trees’ ecological peculiarities, because the furrow floor, where trees are planted, often constitutes {{the lower part of}} the turf or the upper part of the ashen-gray layers having unfavorable water-physical conditions and decreased crop-producing power. Whenever conifer trees grow on the bottom of a furrow excavated in medium and heavy clay loam, their growth is significantly decreased and accompanied by remarkable changes in morphology. Processing of shallow humus thickness soil with multiple cutter results in mixing of A 0, A 1 and A 2 (ashen-gray) layers. Consequently, the processed horizon obtains a lower amount of fertile substances than the vegetable soil on non-processed places. An apparatus for graded soil tillage, its construction, working principle and usage technology are described. The major peculiarity of the device consists in the ability not to crumbl the soil, but to shake down vegetable earth cut by subsurface plow from beneath. The technology involves removing roots and grass outside cultivated land, so that it cannot be then overgrown with weeds. It was found that exploitation of the device improves <b>soil</b> <b>pulverization</b> quality, enhances percentage of separates less than 10 mm and 10 – 50 mm, decreases content of the separate larger than 50 mm, and reduced specific energy output almost three-fold. Vertical displacement of control particles while soil processing with common cutter machines and the suggested device was studied. Establishment and growth of Siberian pine was determined in experimental productive cultures at different planting technologies. It was shown that under the suggested technology, forest plants furrow sowing can be done while soil processing, so that making nurseries becomes unnecessary, and cleaning, ploughing furrows, planting and further tending seedlings are not needed. Soil layers are not mixed, as within usual tillage. Rich soil layer is not withdrawn, so that germination ability of target seeds increases, and growth of seedlings in enhanced. The entire process takes much less energy compared to traditional technologies. Application of the device increases the quality of forest regeneration and reduces labor input owing to the new technology...|$|E
40|$|If 2 ̆ 2 tillage 2 ̆ 2 {{is defined}} as the {{mechanical}} manipulation of soil, it follows, then, that a 2 ̆ 2 tillage system 2 ̆ 2 would be the sequence of soil-manipulation operations performed in producing a crop. Today, however, such a definition is recognized as inadequate. We know, for instance, that the management of non-harvested plant tissue (i. e., residue) affects both crop production and soil erosion, and that field operations in which the soil is not tilled have a marked influence on soil condition. Therefore, in this publication, a tillage system is the sequence of all operations involved in producing the crop, including soil manipulation, harvesting, chopping or shredding of residue, application of pesticides and fertilizers, etc. But before describing and comparing the various tillage systems for corn, some terminologies and possible points of confusion need to be addressed. These have to do with primary vs. secondary tillage and the different ways in which similar tillage systems could be defined. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY TILLAGE For many tillage systems, the specific operations can be separated into 2 ̆ 2 primary 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 secondary. 2 ̆ 2 Primary tillage loosens and fractures the soil to reduce soil strength and to bring or mix residues and fertilizers into the tilled layer. The implements (2 ̆ 2 tools 2 ̆ 2) used for primary tillage include moldboard, chisel and disk plows; heavy tandem, offset and one -way disks; subsoilers; and heavy -duty, powered rotary tillers. These tools usually operate deeper and produce a rougher soil surface than do secondary tillage tools; however, they differ from each other as to amount of soil manipulation and amount of residue left on or near the surface. Secondary tillage is used to kill weeds, cut and cover crop residue, incorporate herbicides and prepare a seedbed. The tools include light- and medium -weight disks, field cultivators, rotary hoes, drags, powered and unpowered harrows and rotary tillers, rollers, ridge- or bed -forming implements, and numerous variations or combinations of these. They operate at a shallower depth than primary tillage tools and provide additional <b>soil</b> <b>pulverization.</b> Equipment that permits primary and/or secondary tillage plus planting in a single operation is also available...|$|E
40|$|Selecting a tillage {{system that}} is best suited to a {{particular}} farming situation is an important management decision. In the past, a crop producer 2 ̆ 7 s primary concerns were field capacity {{and the costs of}} owning and operating equipment. However, with rapidly increasing energy costs, alternative tillage systems are being carefully evaluated and selected by more producers. Previously, the most common tillage system included a moldboard plow to turn residue under either in the fall or spring. Following plowing, spring tillage normally included one or more shallow diskings to kill weeds, incorporate fertilizer and pesticides, and provide loose soil for seed. Other light tillage operations, including field cultivation and harrowing, were also conducted to provide a finely pulverized, weed free, seedbed. Today, preplant tillage operations are being reduced on many farms. Labor, fuel and equipment costs, better erosion control, moisture conservation, and more timely planting are all reasons for the trend toward reduced tillage operations. The wide array of tillage and planting systems available today provides an opportunity to match the tillage system to specific soil and cropping conditions. Six different tillage systems are described here to aid in tillage system selection. Tillage System Descriptions Moldboard Plowing. Fall or spring moldboard plowing has been an accepted tillage operation primarily because of <b>soil</b> <b>pulverization</b> and nearly complete residue incorporation (Figure 1). When followed by one or two spring diskings, moldboard plowing provides an excellent seedbed and allows fertilizer and pesticide incorporation before planting. Even though the moldboard plow buries weed seeds, postemergent cultivation for weed control is often needed. Fall plowing also speeds up soil drying and warming in the spring, thus avoiding delays in spring tillage and planting on soils that dry slowly. Fall moldboard plowing has often been used {{to reduce the number of}} spring tillage operations. Poor weather conditions in the spring may cause crops to be planted late because of insufficient time to plow and prepare the seedbed. The primary disadvantage of fall plowing, however, is the potential for soil erosion throughout the winter and early spring because no surface residue is available to protect the soil. Spring plowing not only reduces the potential for wind and water erosion, but also provides winter grazing for livestock. Spring labor and time shortages, however, often offset these advantages. Furthermore, spring plowing may produce clods, which require an extra, unplanned tillage operation to develop a desirable seedbed. Excessive soil moisture loss, especially during dry years, is another disadvantage with spring plowing...|$|E
