50|$|NHP mainly {{affects the}} farmed shrimp species Litopenaeus vannamei (Pacific white shrimp) and Litopenaeus stylirostris (Western blue shrimp), but {{has also been}} {{reported}} in three other American species, namely Farfantepenaeus aztecus, Farfantepenaeus californiensis, and Litopenaeus setiferus. The highest mortality rates occur in L. vannamei, {{which is one of}} the two most frequently farmed species of shrimp. Untreated, the disease causes mortality rates of up to 90 percent within 30 days. A first outbreak of NHP had been reported in Texas in 1985; the disease then spread to <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquacultures</b> in South America, in 2009 to China and subsequently Southeast Asia, followed by massive outbreaks in that region in 2012-2013.|$|R
50|$|Brine shrimp {{have the}} ability to produce dormant eggs, known as cysts. This has led to the {{extensive}} use of brine <b>shrimp</b> in <b>aquaculture.</b> The cysts may be stored for long periods and hatched on demand to provide a convenient form of live feed for larval fish and crustaceans.|$|R
5000|$|Quietula guaymasiae (Jenkins & Evermann, 1889), the Guaymas goby, is {{endemic to}} the Gulf of California. It can be locally common in its estuary and lagoon habitat, {{but it may}} be {{threatened}} by coastal activity such as development and <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture.</b>|$|E
50|$|Marine {{aquaculture}} in {{the northwest}} is dominated by giant tiger prawn farming near the mangrove areas which have been identified by the Madagascar <b>Shrimp</b> <b>Aquaculture</b> Development Master Plan (Schéma d'aménagement pour l'aquaculture de crevettes à Madagascar - SAACM). These farm areas are systems composed of breeding ponds, a hatchery, a processing and packaging factory and storage facilities.|$|E
5000|$|Aquaculture - This {{activity}} {{is considered the}} greatest contributor to worldwide mangrove loss. Since the 1980s, <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> dramatically increased, replacing mangroves with ponds and degrading surrounding areas with associated pollution. [...] Aquaculture has dramatically affected some regions. For example, 50-80% of mangroves were lost in Asia in the past decades. Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America have been most affected by aquaculture ...|$|E

The bulk of it (276077 t) came from the Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei production. This species is a relative new comer to the aquaculture scenario of Andhra Pradesh with official recorded production starting from 2009 onwards...|$|R
50|$|Given the species' high natural abundances {{and their}} {{occurrence}} as a nuisance species in some brine <b>shrimp</b> / rotifer <b>aquaculture</b> tanks, these copepods were further researched {{as a potential}} live feed for larviculture thereafter.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from fish}} and <b>shrimp,</b> some <b>aquaculture</b> undertakings, such as seaweed and filter-feeding bivalve mollusks like oysters, clams, mussels and scallops, are {{relatively}} benign and even environmentally restorative. Filter-feeders filter pollutants {{as well as}} nutrients from the water, improving water quality. Seaweeds extract nutrients such as inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus directly from the water, and filter-feeding mollusks can extract nutrients as they feed on particulates, such as phytoplankton and detritus.|$|R
50|$|Deforestation {{creates a}} host of {{environmental}} problems: soil erosion, sedimentation of rivers, and loss of natural habitat. Wetlands and mangroves in coastal areas have been seriously degraded by expansion of commercial fishing, <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture,</b> industry, and tourism, causing much of Thailand's biodiversity losses. It is estimated that Thailand in 1961 had 3,500 km2 of mangrove forests. By 2004 that number was less than 2,000 km2 according to the Thai government.|$|E
50|$|Sri Lanka’s {{mangrove}} forests, {{small trees}} that grow in coastal water, have been decreased by 70% since 1915. The size of mangrove ecosystems is being reduced {{because of the}} implementation of agriculture and aquaculture systems like fisheries. <b>Shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> projects {{are one of the}} biggest threats. The shrimp business is growing very fast because of high demand and high profits. One of the negative impacts of shrimp farms is that mangroves are being destroyed where the farms are built.|$|E
50|$|Peam Krasaop Wildlife Sanctuary is {{protected}} by the Cambodian government. It boasts a unique mangrove ecosystem consisting of 23,750 hectares and has around 10,000 people livingwithin its borders. The area is influenced by inter-tidal levels and water from highlandareas. Peam Krasaop Wildlife Sanctuary provides favorable conditions for fishery and other resources. Many people have resided on and done various occupations for their livelihoods and are dependent upon the natural resources in the area, including intensive <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture,</b> large-scale charcoal production, and other purposes.|$|E
50|$|Apart from {{agriculture}} (field crops, {{poultry and}} dairy), the kibbutz breeds <b>shrimp</b> using special <b>aquaculture</b> techniques. It also operates a factory, Sagiv, that produces brass ball-valves and fittings, and runs a guesthouse. It {{is also the}} only Kibbutz in Israel to breed the Australian fish Barramundi.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a plethora}} of {{sustainable}} seafood ecolabels, many conservationists feel that {{the increasing number of}} labels is further confusing consumers in regard to what seafood is sustainable. As of 2010, ecolabels that can be found on seafood include Marine Stewardship Council, Friend of the Sea, KRAV (Sweden), Naturland (Germany), Thai Quality <b>Shrimp,</b> Global <b>Aquaculture</b> Alliance's Best Aquaculture Practices standard, Label Rouge (France), among still others, and the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) is in development. Seafood is also labeled [...] "organic" [...] but USDA standards for organic seafood are still in development.|$|R
25|$|With {{the amount}} of {{worldwide}} fish meal production being almost a constant amount for the last 30+ years and at maximum sustainable yield (MSY), much of the fish meal market has shifted from chicken and pig feed to fish and <b>shrimp</b> feeds as <b>aquaculture</b> has grown in this time period.|$|R
50|$|Aquaculture is {{becoming}} a significant threat to coastal ecosystems. About 20 percent of mangrove forests have been destroyed since 1980, partly due to shrimp farming. An extended cost-benefit analysis of the total economic value of <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> built on mangrove ecosystems found that the external costs were {{much higher than the}} external benefits. Over four decades, 269000 ha of Indonesian mangroves have been converted to shrimp farms. Most of these farms are abandoned within a decade because of the toxin build-up and nutrient loss.|$|E
50|$|The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank financed {{projects}} to develop <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> in the 1980s. Much of {{the emphasis was}} on construction of modern hatcheries. Private investors were also initiating similar {{projects to}} increase capacity and to introduce modern technology that would increase average yields. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has provided assistance to the shrimp and fishing industry in meeting fish safety and quality control standards based on the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) approach.|$|E
50|$|SEHD is {{involved}} in direct and indirect lobbying and advocacy at different levels. SEHD also targets the general public of Bangladesh and those communities that {{are the victims of}} wrong policies. In the past, SEHD has conducted effective advocacy work to raise awareness and understanding of the problems associated with the plantation economy and its effects on local communities and ecologies, indigenous peoples’ access to local resources, <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture,</b> ecological farming, threat of coal mining, the rights of tea plantation workers, sex workers as well as climate change issues.|$|E
50|$|Dendrobranchiata are of huge importance. While in some countries, {{such as the}} United States, {{production}} is almost entirely through fisheries, other countries have concentrated on <b>aquaculture</b> (<b>shrimp</b> farms), including Ecuador where 95% of {{production is}} farmed; some countries produce similar amounts from fisheries and aquaculture, including Mexico, China, India and Indonesia.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} demersal, inhabiting shallow {{estuaries}} with a substrate {{of mud and}} sand {{to a depth of}} 8 m. This habitat is likely to be impacted by the expansion of <b>shrimp</b> farming and <b>aquaculture,</b> but data to assess the effects of habitat loss on the scaly boy are currently lacking.|$|R
50|$|With {{the amount}} of {{worldwide}} fish meal production being almost a constant amount for the last 30+ years and at maximum sustainable yield (MSY), much of the fish meal market has shifted from chicken and pig feed to fish and <b>shrimp</b> feeds as <b>aquaculture</b> has grown in this time period.|$|R
50|$|In many South-east Asian nations, <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> {{has been}} {{instrumental}} in mangrove loss, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s. Due to high economic returns, shrimp farming was promoted to improve economic conditions in many countries. The social and economic benefits of shrimp farming are substantial. Shrimp farms are located close to the coast to reduce costs by using tidal energy and short canal lengths to the coast. Consequently, vast tracts of mangrove forest have been replaced by numerous ponds. Compounding mangrove losses is the short life span of individual ponds (5-10 years), imposing a shifting cultivation pattern to shrimp farming.|$|E
50|$|The gallinule inhabits mainly {{freshwater}} lowland wetlands, usually below 125 m elevation, such as streams, springs or seeps, natural ponds, marshes, wet meadows, lotus and taro fields, reservoirs, sediment basins, sewage ponds, {{and drainage}} ditches. It prefers dense emergent vegetation near open water, often with floating mats of vegetation, with water depths {{of less than}} a metre. To a lesser extent it will visit brackish or marine wetlands such as lagoons and <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> ponds. Although the birds are non-migratory, banding studies show that some dispersal occurs in spring between wetlands (and possibly between islands), in response to changes in water levels.|$|E
50|$|As {{of the end}} of 1987, {{prevailing}} {{methods for}} culturing shrimp in Bangladesh were still relatively unsophisticated, and average yields per hectare were low. In the late 1980s, almost all inland shrimping was done by capture rather than by intensive aquaculture. Farmers relied primarily on wild postlarval and juvenile shrimp as their sources of stock, acquired either by trapping in ponds during tidal water exchange or by gathering from local estuaries and stocking directly in the ponds. Despite the seemingly low level of technology applied to <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture,</b> it became an increasingly important part of the frozen seafood industry in the mid-1980s. The shrimp farming industry in Bangladesh has been handicapped by low-quality and low prices.|$|E
40|$|Southeast Asia, a Subregion of the Asia-Pacific Region, is {{composed}} of countries of diverse socio-economic circumstances. Fisheries production, particularly that of the aquaculture sector, is relatively developed and {{is important to the}} economy of this area. Some 80 economic aquatic species are the subject of culture. Many of these species, which include fin fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and seaweeds, are produced in consequential quantities. Total production from the Subregion in 1983 amounted to about 880 000 mt which represented nine percent of total world aquaculture production in said year, and a 100 % increase in the area within the decade (1975 - 1983). Unit production is comparatively low as it is usually done {{with the use of the}} extensive level of management developed after long years of experience by fish farmers. Higher rate of production in recent years is a trend especially for high value and exportable species like the penaeid <b>shrimps.</b> <b>Aquaculture</b> production tends to have accelerated growth while capture fisheries production tends to increase very gradually or levels off. Technical and non-technical constraints occur which hinder rapid progress of aquaculture in Southeast Asia. This will require the attention of research institutions and governments. However, bright prospects for future increase in production in this industry are developing in the area. Specific instances to support this forecast are discussed...|$|R
25|$|The canal {{stretch from}} Basin bridge up to Marakkanam can {{constitute}} significant traffic {{of salt and}} marine products because of salt pans and <b>aquaculture</b> <b>shrimp</b> farms all along the route. In the upstream direction from Pondicherry via Marakkanam to Chennai, the main traffic consists of salt, fertilizers and timber from Marakkanam, Thiruvallur, Kanchipuram, Villupuram and Pondicherry.|$|R
50|$|Around 500 t {{of brown}} tiger prawns are caught each year. Fisheries in Torres Strait are worth around A$24 million per year. It {{is closely related}} to Penaeus monodon, with which it can hybridise. It has the {{potential}} to be used in <b>aquaculture</b> (<b>shrimp</b> farming) since, although it grows less rapidly than P. monodon, it commands higher prices.|$|R
50|$|U.S. investors {{account for}} {{nearly two-thirds of the}} foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) in Honduras. The stock of U.S. direct investment in Honduras in 2005 was $402 million, up from $339 million in 2004. The overall flow of FDI into Honduras in 2005 totaled $568 million, $196 million of which was spent in the maquila sector. The United States continued as the largest contributor of FDI. The most substantial U.S. investments in Honduras are in the maquila sector, fruit production (particularly bananas, melons, and pineapple), tourism, energy generation, <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture,</b> animal feed production, telecommunications, fuel distribution, cigar manufacturing, insurance, brewing, leasing, food processing, and furniture manufacturing. Many U.S. franchises, particularly in the restaurant sector, operate in Honduras.|$|E
5000|$|Ecuador has {{substantial}} remaining mangrove {{forests in}} the provinces of El Oro, Guayas, Manabi and Esmeraldas with limited forest remaining in Santa Elena. The northern portion of Esmeraldas province has a large pristine mangrove forest that is preserved as the Reserva Ecológica Cayapas-Mataje (REMACAN) and is an original Ramsar site. [...] This forest is the most preserved within Ecuador and likely the most pristine forest along the Pacific Coast of the Americas.The only other major mangrove holding in Esmeraldas is in-and-around the community of Muisne and the Rio Muisne Estuary Swampland Wildlife Refuges. The mangroves in-and-around the estuaries of Muisne have decreased in area from 3222 ha in 1971 to 1065 ha as of 2005, during this time commercial <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> has become the dominant land-cover within this estuary environment.|$|E
50|$|Although shrimp farming has {{disrupted}} social structures, it {{is possible}} for both commercial industries and independent farmers to succeed. Closed system <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> for instance, is becoming widely used in the US and is making its way to Southeast Asia. This system takes place indoors in moderate sized pools which efficiently circulates the water. In some cases filter feeders such as shellfish and other fish are introduced in the system, feeding off nutrients in the water that would otherwise be cycled out. This option is more environmentally safe than large scale intensive farming practices. Unfortunately, this system is capital intensive and would be difficult for small scale, independent shrimp farmers to acquire. However, this would be an excellent alternative for larger shrimp industries in Thailand. Another alternative would be to revert to traditional shrimp farming practices, without overstocking and the use of harmful chemicals. This would be an ideal option for small scale shrimp farmers supplying for their own community as well as creating an independent food source < http://mangroveactionproject.org/issues/shrimp-farming/sustainable-alternatives-of-shrimp-aquaculture>.|$|E
