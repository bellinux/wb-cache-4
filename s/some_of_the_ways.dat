25|$|Colditz: The Full Story (1984) : While {{the first}} two books {{can be read as}} {{adventure}} narratives, and have a distinctly ‘Battler Briton’ ethos of ‘sticking one up to the goons’ this book takes a more analytic approach, and covers a number of previously suppressed details. For example, Reid describes <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> prisoners obtained contraband material, and how British prisoners communicated clandestinely with the authorities in London. He also gives a full account of how prisoners discovered the 'Singen Escape Route'. He also deals with some of the tensions and tragedies of wartime Europe, for example the tensions in the French contingents between Gaullists and supporters of Pétain. The tensions in the Polish contingent are still skated over however. The book was written while Poland was still a Communist state (indeed while the 1981 state of emergency was still operating). Having been schooled at Clongowes, Reid's comments on individuals seem to show sympathy for the 'Conservative Catholic Patriot' officers at Colditz, without giving enough background to allow readers to assess whether there were any continuing controversies around some of these positions.|$|E

2500|$|This high {{elevation}} {{habitat of}} high winds, prolonged snow cover, steep terrain, high temperature variability, and intense UV radiation lead to special species adaptations. Alpine regions generally have hypoxic conditions {{that lead to}} additional energy expenses for organisms. Increased elevations usually lead to shorter breeding season in animals, {{as is the case}} in the alpine ecosystems in the North Cascades. [...] In addition to the shorter breeding season, wildlife often requires seasonal movement to different elevations in order to find adequate food and habitat. However, species such as the white-tailed ptarmigan, hoary marmots, and pikas remain in high elevations of the Cascades year round left only to go to patchy and scattered alpine vegetation. [...] The majority of species will move to lower elevations at some time throughout their life history.
