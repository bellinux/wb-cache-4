5|$|The <b>spore</b> <b>print</b> is brown, and the {{dimensions}} of the ellipsoid (oval-shaped) spores are 7.5–9 by 5–6μm.|$|E
5|$|Species of Crepidotus {{having a}} similar shape can be {{distinguished}} by their brown <b>spore</b> <b>print,</b> compared with the white <b>spore</b> <b>print</b> of P.stipticus. Schizophyllum commune has a densely hairy white to grayish cap and longitudinally split gill-folds on the underside. The ruddy panus mushroom (Panus rudis) is larger, has a reddish-brown cap that fades to pinkish-tan, and shows lilac tinges when young, fresh, and moist. Some Paxillus species may have a similar appearance, but they have yellow-brown spore prints.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{a member}} of Hygrophoropsis, Aphroditeola olida is also similar in {{appearance}} to H.aurantiaca but can be distinguished from the false chanterelle by its smaller, pinkish fruit bodies and candy-like odour. It also has smaller spores. Chrysomphalina chrysophylla has a yellowish brown cap and unforked yellow gills. Cortinarius hesleri, an eastern North American species that associates with oaks, has a rusty brown <b>spore</b> <b>print</b> and a cortina in young specimens. The poisonous jack-o'-lantern mushrooms (genus Omphalotus) comprise another group of lookalikes; however, they have straight, non-forked true gills. The European wood-rotting species Haasiella splendidissima, sometimes confused with H.aurantiaca, is most readily distinguished from the latter by its pink <b>spore</b> <b>print</b> and gills that do not fork.|$|E

5000|$|Volvariella is a genus of {{mushrooms}} {{with deep}} salmon pink gills and <b>spore</b> <b>prints.</b>|$|R
50|$|The species R. brunneviolacea, and R. romellii are similar, {{though both}} have darker <b>spore</b> <b>prints.</b>|$|R
5|$|Multifurca: agaricoid; caps zonate (also {{visible in}} cut through trama); gills {{regularly}} forked; only M. furcata exuding latex; <b>spore</b> <b>print</b> orange; spores very small; microscopical trama and hymenium features very variable.|$|E
5|$|P.semilanceata {{has also}} been {{confused}} with the toxic muscarine-containing species Inocybe geophylla, a whitish mushroom with a silky cap, yellowish-brown to pale grayish gills, and a dull yellowish-brown <b>spore</b> <b>print.</b>|$|E
5|$|Russula: agaricoid, gasteroid or pleurotoid; never exuding latex; caps often brightly {{coloured}} with stipe and gills much paler; caps not zonate*; <b>spore</b> <b>print</b> white, cream, ochre, or orange; no true lactiferous hyphae*; sphaerocytes {{abundant in}} gill, cap, and stipe trama.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} fungi have white spore powder but {{members of the}} genus Abundisporus have colored spores and produce {{yellowish}} <b>spore</b> <b>prints.</b> Cystidia are absent.|$|R
50|$|Pluteus {{is a large}} genus of fungi {{with over}} 300 species. They are wood rotting saprobes with pink <b>spore</b> <b>prints</b> and gills that are free from the stem.|$|R
25|$|In general, {{identification}} to genus {{can often}} be accomplished in the field using a local mushroom guide. Identification to species, however, requires more effort; one must remember that a mushroom develops from a button stage into a mature structure, and only the latter can provide certain characteristics needed for {{the identification of the}} species. However, over-mature specimens lose features and cease producing spores. Many novices have mistaken humid water marks on paper for white <b>spore</b> <b>prints,</b> or discolored paper from oozing liquids on lamella edges for colored <b>spored</b> <b>prints.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>spore</b> <b>print</b> is {{cinnamon}} or rusty brown. The spores are elliptic, smooth-walled, nonamyloid (not absorbing iodine when {{stained with}} Melzer's reagent), and measure 6.6–8 by 3.7–4.4μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, and four-spored, with dimensions of 16–25 by 5–7μm.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius subdulcis has cream <b>spore</b> <b>print</b> with {{a slight}} salmon tinge. The spores are oval, with largish warts of around 1 {{micrometre}} (μm) which are joined by a well-developed network of mostly thin ridges. The spores measure 7.5–11μm by 6.5–9μm, and are amyloid or ellipsoid in shape.|$|E
5|$|Like other boletes, Boletus pinophilus has small pores on the {{underside}} of its cap rather than gills. These are coloured white at first, becoming yellow with age and olivaceous-brown at full maturity. The spores are cylindric-ellipsoid, smooth, with oil drops and dimensions 15.520 by 4.55.5µm. They produce an olive-brown <b>spore</b> <b>print.</b>|$|E
50|$|Psathyrella spadicea {{is found}} in Europe and North America. In North America, it {{is more common in}} {{northern}} regions, including Alaska and the Yukon Territories, than further south. Fruitbodies produce reddish to red-brown <b>spore</b> <b>prints.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ascomycete Bulgaria inquinans forms similar, rubbery-gelatinous, blackish fruit {{bodies on}} oak. Their upper {{surfaces}} are entirely smooth, however, and they produce copious black (not white) <b>spore</b> <b>prints,</b> often leaving a black stain if wiped with the hand.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spore</b> <b>prints</b> {{are dark}} {{chocolate}} brown. The smooth, thick-walled spores are , and typically measure 5-6.5 by 3.5-4 μm. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are scattered, club-shaped to cylindric and have dimensions {{of up to}} 22 by 7 μm.|$|R
5|$|Robert Shaffer defined four {{forms of}} R.densifolia in a 1962 {{monograph}} on section Compactae, differentiating them by <b>spore</b> <b>print</b> color, fruiting pattern, odor, gill spacing, {{and the intensity}} of the color change with bruising. Three forms are from the Pacific Northwest region of North America: form dilatoria has fruit bodies that darken to lavender gray to brownish gray; form fragrans has a fragrant odor and widely spaced gills; form cremeispora produces a light yellow <b>spore</b> <b>print</b> and has an obscurely two-layered cap cuticle. Form gregata, found in the eastern United States, grows gregariously in jack pine and Scotch pine forests. The nomenclatural database Index Fungorum lumps these forms, as well as f. subrubescen, published by Patrick Reumaux in 1996, together into synonymy. Other synonyms include Rolf Singer's 1931 variety caucasica, Roger Heim's 1938 variety latericola, and C. Dagron's 1999 variety colettarum.|$|E
5|$|The {{flesh of}} the {{mushroom}} is smooth, thin and white. The taste and odor are mild and have no distinct smell. When treated with a dilute solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or sulfuric acid, the flesh turns reddish. The <b>spore</b> <b>print</b> of H.olivaceoalbus is white.|$|E
5|$|The <b>spore</b> <b>print</b> is greyish-black. Spores are {{narrowly}} elliptical to spindle-shaped, smooth, {{and measure}} 17–23 by 4.5–7.5μm. The cystidia are somewhat spindle-shaped or narrowly club-shaped, and measure 112–164 by 13–20µm. They have characteristically thick walls, up to 7.5µm wide {{in the middle}} portion.|$|E
30|$|Basidiospores {{are often}} {{collected}} from mushrooms as <b>spore</b> <b>prints.</b> The mushroom cap might be laid directly onto filter paper, aluminium foil or (water) agar. Alternatively, mushrooms might be fixed into the lids of Petri-dishes by agar, petroleum jelly (Vaseline) or other suitable gluing agents, or positioned by toothpicks or glass rods above the respective surfaces {{so that the}} mature spores drop down from the mushrooms onto these. Repeated <b>spore</b> <b>prints</b> might be taken from a mushroom {{with the hope that}} the number of contaminants is lower in later prints. Of advantage for many species is that basidiospores can be stored for some time. When they are plated for germination, antibiotics are then used in growth medium in order to reduce outgrowth of unwanted microorganisms as much as possible (Snelling et al. 1996; Choi et al. 1999; Lodge et al. 2004; Kropp 2005).|$|R
2500|$|Members of this genus are small, convex to fan-shaped, and [...] Species have cheilocystidia <b>Spore</b> <b>prints</b> are {{yellow-brown}} to brown. All {{species of}} Crepidotus {{are known to}} be secondary decomposers of plant matter; most are saprobic on wood. Little is known about the ebility of various species; the usually small and insubstantial specimens discourage mycophagy.|$|R
50|$|Volvopluteus {{differs from}} Volvariella morphologically {{by the average}} spore length over 11 µm and the pileipellis {{composed}} of relatively thin hyphae embedded in a conspicuous gelatinous matrix. The same characters {{and the presence of}} a volva separate Volvopluteus from Pluteus. All three genera are characterized by the pink to pink-brown <b>spore</b> <b>prints</b> and inverse hymenophoral trama.|$|R
5|$|The <b>spore</b> <b>print</b> is olive to olive-brown. The smooth spores are {{somewhat}} oblong to slightly ventricose (fattened in the middle), and measure 10–14 by 4–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 25–35 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} faces of the tubes) are fuse-shaped and ventricose, with dimensions of 50–60 by 10–14µm.|$|E
5|$|Agaricales {{specialist}} Rolf Singer included Suillus brevipes in the subsection Suillus of genus Suillus, an infrageneric (a {{taxonomic level}} below genus) grouping of species {{characterized by a}} cinnamon-brown <b>spore</b> <b>print,</b> and pores less than 1mm wide. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of ribosomal DNA sequences shows that the most closely related species to Suillus brevipes include S.luteus, S.pseudobrevipes, and S.weaverae (formerly Fuscoboletinus weaverae).|$|E
5|$|Agaricus bernardii {{mushrooms}} {{produce a}} dark brown <b>spore</b> <b>print.</b> The spores are smooth, broadly elliptical, and have dimensions of 6–7.5 by 5–6μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and club-shaped, measuring 14–25 by 4–7μm; the sterigmata are 4–5μm. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are broadly club-shaped to cylindrical, hyaline (translucent), and measure 17–30 by 4–8μm.|$|E
50|$|The hyphal {{system of}} Clavaria species is always monomitic. The context hyphae are inflated, thin-walled, and lack clamp {{connections}} (though Petersen's amended {{concept of the}} genus includes some species with clamps). The basidia are two- to four-spored, in some species with an open, loop-like clamp connection at the base. Spores are smooth or spiny. <b>Spore</b> <b>prints</b> are white.|$|R
5000|$|The genus {{contains}} {{species with}} clitocyboid (gilled mushrooms that lack partial veils and feature white, yellowish, or pinkish <b>spore</b> <b>prints)</b> to [...] (mushroom with a [...] gill attachment, a cartilage-like stem, a broad or depressed cap surface and lacking a ring and volva) fruit body types. The fruit bodies are tough when dry, but can revive when moistened. They grow on rotting wood or woody material.|$|R
5|$|<b>Spore</b> <b>prints</b> are purplish brown to {{chocolate}} brown. The smooth, thick-walled spores are broadly ellipsoidal, {{and typically}} measure 5.8–7.3 by 3.7–4.4μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, hyaline (translucent, and measure 20–21.3 by 5.8–7.0μm. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are sac-shaped to club-shaped, hyaline to pale yellowish brown in color, and have dimensions of 18.3–25.6 by 7.3–11.0μm; {{there are no}} cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia).|$|R
5|$|Inocybe godeyi {{leaves a}} snuff-brown <b>spore</b> <b>print,</b> while the {{individual}} spores themselves are smooth and almond-shaped. The spores measure 9 to 11.5 by 5.5 to 7micrometres. Each basidium bares four spores. Both the cheilocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} edges of the gills) and the pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the faces of the gills) are spindle- or bottle-shaped, with some kind of encrustation at the tip. They have thick cell walls.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{described}} in 1874 {{as a species}} of Boletus, the fungus has also been classified in the genus Leccinum because of the scabers on the stipe, or in Tylopilus {{because of the color}} of the <b>spore</b> <b>print.</b> Molecular genetic analysis revealed that the lilac-brown bolete was separate from both of these genera, and merited placement in a new genus. Sutorius was created to contain this bolete and the closely related Australian species S.australiensis.|$|E
5|$|The dense, bow-like {{lamellae}} are pale-orange to pale-ochre {{and on the}} stipe basifixed {{or slightly}} decurrent. They are brittle and intermixed with shorter lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem) as well as partly forking near the stem. In old age or in cases of injury they receive initially dark red, later grey green spots. The <b>spore</b> <b>print</b> is pale ochre.|$|E
50|$|Micropsalliota fruitbodies have an {{ring on the}} stipe, {{free gill}} attachment, and brown spores. Micropsalliota is {{distinguished}} from similar genera with dark <b>spore</b> <b>prints</b> by its small- to medium-sized fruit bodies, ellipsoid to cymbiform (boat-shaped) basidiospores with an apical thickening in the endosporium, cheilocystidia that are often capitate (ending in a distinct compact head) or nearly so, and pileipellis hyphae encrusted with a pigment that turns olive to green after application of NH4OH.|$|R
30|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that basidiospore transfer from upside-down incubated mushrooms with open hymenia to the plastic lids depends on an active ballistospore discharge mechanism (Table  1). This suggested that producing <b>spore</b> <b>prints</b> from up-flying <b>spores</b> would be more selective to the basidiospores than the usual <b>spore</b> <b>prints</b> collected underneath wild mushrooms {{which tend to be}} mixed with fallen spores and cells of other microbes. This assumption was tested by plating spore solutions from classical <b>prints</b> and <b>spore</b> solutions collected from plastic lids positioned above upside-down incubated mushrooms (Table  4; Figs.  5, 6). In contrast to conventional <b>spore</b> <b>prints,</b> presence of yeasts or spores from other filamentous fungi which need animal vectors or air flow for their movements was rarely detected in plating tests of spore solutions which were collected from plastic lids positioned above reversed incubated mushrooms (at maximum 10 % of samples were contaminated). Bacteria were in somewhat higher frequency present (in up to 22 % of total samples of an individual test series), possibly because they may at times be flying directly with a basidiospore. However, there are possible measures against bacteria through addition of suitable antibiotics to the growth media (Fig.  5; Table  4). Further, accumulation of larger numbers of bacterial cells can be precluded by shorter incubation times applied for basidiospore collection (Fig.  6). Already 2 – 4  h of incubation are sufficient to collect 104 – 105  spores from mushrooms in the plastic lids (Fig.  2) with no or exceptionally a few bacteria being present in the spore solutions (Fig.  6). Spore ejection rates in our study (Fig.  2; see Table  1 for total ejection figures) correlate with ratios of ballistospore ejection/h from mushrooms reported by Buller (1909, 1922) and to ratios which can be calculated from the spore emission data/s × cm 2 compiled in Saar and Salm (2014).|$|R
5|$|According to Takahashi, the inamyloid spores, the diverticulate cap cuticle hyphae, and {{the dark}} pigment in the gill hyphae suggest that the fungus is best {{classified}} in the section Hiemales of the genus Mycena. Because of its medium-sized, partly collybioid fruit bodies (i.e., small to medium-sized with white <b>spore</b> <b>prints</b> and convex caps, similar to species once placed in the genus Collybia), the white cord-like rhizomorphs, and its distinctly intervenose gills, it has an isolated position within the section.|$|R
