40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel {{design for a}} 4 degree of freedom pneumatically-actuated upper-limb rehabilitation device. BONES {{is based on a}} parallel mechanism that actuates the upper arm by means of two passive, <b>sliding</b> <b>rods</b> pivoting with respect to a fixed structural frame. Four, mechanicallygrounded pneumatic actuators are placed behind the main structural frame to control shoulder motion via the <b>sliding</b> <b>rods,</b> and a fifth cylinder is located on the structure to control elbow flexion/extension. The device accommodates a wide range of motion of the human arm, while also achieving low inertia and direct-drive force generation capability at the shoulder. A key accomplishment of this design is the ability to generate arm internal/external rotation without any circular bearing element such as a ring, a design feature inspired by the biomechanics of the human forearm. The paper describes the rationale for this device and its main design aspects including its kinematics, range of motion, and force generation capability. patients improved access to repetitive aspects of movement training at a reduced cost.

This is an external temperature control system and can be replaced by any system you may have available. Extruder calibration To ensure the stepper movement translates into the piston movement accordingly to the g-code, it needs to be calibrated properly. Calibration set-up In principle, the calibration set-up requires: CNC control of the piston powering motor (we use Nema 11 with a planetary reductor) the assembled extruder (at least the moving parts) a precise displacement measurement device (calipers, etc., high precision indicators are preferrable) The calibration protocol requires a set-up, where the piston translation, can be precisely measured in the axis of extrusion. For this purpose, the measurement device is fixed on the extruder in a way, that the extruder movement is translated directly into the measurement. Calibration procedure adjust the steps/unit value of the motor settings in the cnc control software (or use default values) command piston movement for an exact distance measure the real movement distance and compare repeat steps 1 - 3, until the g-code value coincides with the measured value For a Nema 11 motor (with a planetary reductor) + an M 5 spindle (0. 5 mm pitch/rotation), the default STEPS/UNIT value is 37914. 30. Thermistor calibration Every thermistor analog output values have to be mapped to actual temperature values via an equation. Every thermistor needs to be calibrated as described in this section. EQUIPMENT: thermo block/plate (heat source), alcochol thermometer, thermistor, setup for reading analog signal from the thermistor, oil, glass. pour a small glass of oil (50 mL or so) place the glass on the heat source fit a thermistor to the alcochol thermometer sink the thermistor - thermometer setup into the glass with oil prepare the system to read analog values turn on the heat source and record sensor analog output at every 1 °C increment plot data (x - axis: analog output, y-axis: real temperature) fit the best trendline to the data obtained (MATLAB or EXCEL are good tools for completing this task but there are also others) software will yield a fit line equation which then has to be transcribed into microcontroller firmware (we used Arduino Mega) Now your thermistor will give out the right temperature values. step_vitaprint. zi...|$|E

40|$|Scoliosis is {{a spinal}} {{deformity}} characterised by lateral curvatures of the spine. It typically occurs during adolescence, but in rare incidences {{can occur in}} young children. In adolescents, if severe or progressive, surgical treatment {{in the form of}} spinal fusion using screw and rod constructs may take place. However, in younger patients the spine and lungs are still growing, therefore, fusion is not recommended before the age of eight years. For early onset scoliosis fusionless techniques are used, with the current gold standard being traditional growing rods, incorporating pedicle screws and rods, which are periodically lengthened through frequent surgical interventions. Due to the number surgeries throughout the treatment period, this treatment suffers from high complication rates. As this treatment is far from ideal, alternative treatments are being explored to reduce these issues. This thesis describes the initial development of an alternative implant for the treatment of early onset scoliosis to alleviate the issues of traditional growing rods. The implant was based on a pedicle screw and rod system, but incorporated a bearing component to allow free extension of the construct without the need for further surgery. The development of the implant design was achieved through finite element analysis of individual components and of constructs using contact conditions. It was initially intended to use a UHMWPE bearing component incorporating a crosslink and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V <b>sliding</b> <b>rod,</b> with a commercially available pedicle screw. However, issues of the construct size lead {{to the development of a}} novel screw design incorporating an alumina bearing, a decoupled crosslink and CoCrMo <b>sliding</b> <b>rod.</b> The results of the finite element analysis show that an implant incorporating an alumina bearing component is a promising area for development, however, additional investigations of the construct are still required...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePainlevé’s {{paradox is}} a {{well-known}} problem in rigid-body dynamics, of which the forward dynamics equations could have no solution. To handle this situation, an assumption of tangential impact is often introduced. Although the assumption seems to provide a good fix, it {{still needs to be}} mathematically examined via analyzing the asymptotic property of a compliance-based model at the limit of rigidity. In this paper, we revisit the paradox using the typical Painlevé’s example of a <b>rod</b> <b>sliding</b> on a rough surface. For convenience, the interaction at the contact point of the rod is represented by a linear spring to scale the local normal compliance, coupled with Coulomb’s law to reflect friction. We perform an asymptotic analysis using the spring stiffness as a perturbation parameter. The rod dynamics in the Painlevé’s paradox, accompanying the variation of friction status, consists of three distinct phases as follows: An initial period of sliding which allows contact force to diverge with the increase of the spring stiffness, a period of sticking which ends at the occurrence of a reverse slip motion, and a reverse slip phase which causes the rod to be detached from the contact surface. As the stiffness goes to infinity, all the time intervals of the three phases converge to zero. This analysis theoretically confirms the assumption of the tangential impact in the paradox of <b>sliding</b> <b>rod</b> dynamics...|$|R
