Driven mad, the boss places the baby in a deep freeze room next to Max's corpse so the baby can be with his son, {{prompting}} Thongs and Octopus {{to fight for the}} baby. The two end up trapped in the room with two minions, but are saved when Inspector Mok arrives with the Landlord, who swiftly cracks the lock to the room. Thongs and Octopus run to the garage with the comatose baby, where Thongs attempts to revive him with a makeshift defibrillator powered by a car battery from a Pagani Zonda. Despite his efforts, the baby does not come to and is driven off in an ambulance, where his heart is found to be beating weakly. Imprisoned for kidnapping, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord volunteer for a mock capital punishment demonstration during an open day, using the opportunity to apologise to their loved ones. After the demonstration, Inspector Mok informs the three that their sentences have been further reduced by the Department of Justice. Thongs, Octopus, and the Landlord then <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> alive and well with his parents. As a token of appreciation for saving the baby's life, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord are offered jobs by the Lee family as a bodyguard, chauffeur and head of security respectively.|$|E

Lyrics for the album were all derived from a single notebook, with Manson admitting that the content of previous work was too scattered, as they were composed of material taken from up to 20 different notebooks. He has described it as being intentionally sparse lyrically, elaborating that blues music stems from the [...] "guttural, visceral element of music.

This survey was a [...] "campaign [...] effectively employed a variety of media advocacy strategies" [...] to alarm the public and [...] "galvanized" [...] support against atmospheric nuclear testing. Lewis Strauss and Edward Teller, dubbed the [...] "father of the hydrogen bomb," [...] both sought to tamp down on these fears, arguing that fallout [...] were fairly harmless and that a test ban would enable the Soviet Union to surpass the US in nuclear capabilities.

Moreover, widespread antinuclear protests were organized and led by theologian and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Albert Schweitzer, whose appeals were endorsed by Pope Pius XII, and Linus Pauling, the latter of whom organized an anti-test petition signed by more than 9,000 scientists across 43 countries (including the infirm and elderly Albert Einstein). Although notably, many health scientists that were asked to sign were critical of Pauling's [...] "thoroughly unscientific" [...] fallout assumptions, despite most wishing for a test-ban for other reasons, they could not bring themselves to sign a document that promoted such exaggerations of the dangers, as it would result in eventual public distrust of scientists in the long term.|$|E
