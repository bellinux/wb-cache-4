40|$|This {{paper is}} design method of {{programmed}} logic control FX 2 N automatic to control pumping station. The {{programmable logic controller}} (PLC) has described the implementation of hardware and software to control mode for starting and <b>stopping</b> <b>engines</b> and <b>control</b> of the gauge group of pumping station. The results obtained from tests {{on the performance of}} the pump unit is supplied PLC correlates the operational parameters to the rate asked by the user and monitors the system during its normal operation and the triggers. A constant demand for better and more efficient manufacturing and process machinery has led to the requirement for higher quality and reliability in control techniques. Programmable logic controllers or PLC’s have been around forever (in technological terms). Their proven reliability in harsh environments together with their ability to handle multiple inputs and outputs has made them the cornerstone in the majority of modern day industrial control systems. PLC systems can be combined with most other technologies to provide a sophisticated control and monitoring solution...|$|R
5000|$|English Electric EL.100 (Polish designations EP01, EL.100, E100 and E01) was a {{class of}} {{electric}} locomotives used by the Polish State Railways. Originally built and designed by English Electric as a line engine, it was used in Poland mainly for shunting, as a <b>supplemental</b> <b>engine</b> to ferry steam locomotives across the Warsaw Cross-City Line tunnel, between Pruszków and Otwock. It was the first electric locomotive used in Poland.|$|R

50|$|Putting into Vella Lavella on 1 October with an LST convoy {{which she}} had joined at sea, Foote joined in {{fighting}} off an enemy air attack later that day, splashing at least one plane. She escorted the LSTs back to Guadalcanal, returning to convoy duty untilcovering the landings on the Treasury Islands on 26-27 October. She put out from Purvis Bay on 31 October to bombard Buka Island and the Shortlands, neutralizing enemy airfields to prevent air opposition to the Bougainville landings. Alerted to the movement of an enemy task force, Foote made contact by radar {{in the early morning}} of 2 November, and in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay which followed, she was hit by an enemy torpedo which blew off her stern, as the other ships of her division launched the torpedo attacks which helped sink two Japanese ships and turned back the planned assault by the Japanese task force on the shipping off Bougainville. With 19 killed and 17 wounded, Footes men kept their ship afloat despite the fact that both <b>engines</b> were <b>stopped,</b> steering <b>control</b> lost and the main deck awash aft. They also manned their guns to splash at least one wave of Japanese planes which attacked the American ships the next morning. She was towed into Purvis Bay on 4 November for repairs.|$|R

50|$|Regardless of {{chemical}} constraints, RP-1 has supply constraints, {{due to the}} very small size of the launch-vehicle industry versus other consumers of petroleum. While the material price of such a highly refined hydrocarbon is still less than many other rocket propellants, the number of RP-1 suppliers is limited. A few engines have attempted to use more standard, wide-distribution petroleum products such as jet fuel or even diesel. By using alternate or <b>supplemental</b> <b>engine</b> cooling methods, some can tolerate the non-optimal formulations.|$|R
