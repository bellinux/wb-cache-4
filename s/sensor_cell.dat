50|$|The {{precision}} of these sensors is typically measured in spectral resolution, {{which is the}} width of each band of the spectrum that is captured. If the scanner detects {{a large number of}} fairly narrow frequency bands, it is possible to identify objects even if they are only captured in a handful of pixels. However, spatial resolution is a factor in addition to spectral resolution. If the pixels are too large, then multiple objects are captured in the same pixel and become difficult to identify. If the pixels are too small, then the energy captured by each <b>sensor</b> <b>cell</b> is low, and the decreased signal-to-noise ratio reduces the reliability of measured features.|$|E

40|$|Real-time {{monitoring}} of mesangial cell-macrophage cross-talk using SEAP in vitro and ex vivo. BackgroundMacrophage-mesangial cell interaction plays {{a crucial role}} in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis. We established a novel system for continuous, real-time {{monitoring of}} cross-talk between macrophages and mesangial cells in vitro and ex vivo. MethodsRat mesangial cells were genetically engineered to produce secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) under the control of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) enhancer elements. The established <b>sensor</b> <b>cells</b> were exposed to macrophages or macrophage-derived factors, and the level of SEAP production was evaluated. ResultsIn vitro, the established cells expressed and secreted SEAP when exposed to activated macrophages or to cytokines produced by macrophages. The kinetics of SEAP activity in culture media was closely correlated with the expression level of SEAP mRNA. The <b>sensor</b> <b>cells</b> also secreted SEAP in response to media conditioned by macrophage-accumulating, inflamed rat glomeruli. When the <b>sensor</b> <b>cells</b> were transferred adoptively into rat glomeruli subjected to acute anti-Thy 1 glomerulonephritis, the isolated glomeruli containing <b>sensor</b> <b>cells</b> secreted SEAP rapidly and progressively. ConclusionThese data suggested that the established system provides simple and useful tools for monitoring of cross-talk between macrophages and mesangial cells in vitro and ex vivo. This approach would be useful for investigation of molecular mechanisms involved in mesangial cell-macrophage interaction and also for screening of therapeutic agents that efficiently interfere with the link between infiltrating leukocytes and resident glomerular cells...|$|R
50|$|The Konica F was {{the first}} 35 mm SLR camera {{produced}} by Konishiroku, released in February, 1960. It featured a built-in light metering system to set the correct exposure. The meter utilized a large selenium cell panel {{on the front of}} the viewfinder prism to detect light levels. This type <b>sensor</b> <b>cell</b> generates its own small electric current, so the metering system does not require a battery. On the other hand, selenium cells are known to degrade over time, losing accuracy or eventually failing. Many cameras and handheld meters relied upon selenium cells at one time, but they were gradually replaced by CdS and other types of cells that require a battery, but tend to give long-term reliability. Between 600 and 1500 total Konica Fs were produced, making it a highly sought-after camera.|$|E

50|$|The OCM {{continuously}} monitors {{how much}} oil {{is in the}} water that is pumped out the discharge line of the OWS system. The OCM will not allow the oil concentration of the exiting water to be above the Marpol standard of 15 ppm. This standard was first adopted in 1977 with Resolution A.393(X) which was published by IMO. These standards were updated various but the most current resolution is MEPC 107(49). The oil content meter will sound an alarm if the liquid leaving the system has an unsatisfactory amount {{of oil in the}} mixture. If it is still above that standard, then the bilge water will be reentered into the system until it meets the required criteria. The OCM uses light beams to determine how oily the water in the system is. The system will then gauge the oil concentration based on a light intensity meter. Modern oil content meters also have a data logging system that can store oil concentration measurements for more than 18 months.If the OCM determines that there is far too much of a type of oil, the OCM may be fouled and needs to be flushed out. Running clean water through the OCM <b>sensor</b> <b>cell</b> is one way it can be cleaned. Also scrubbing the sensor area with a bottle brush is another effective method. The new MEPC 107(49) regulations have set out stringent actions that require the OCM to be tamper proof and also the OCM needs to have an alarm that sounds whenever the OCM is being cleaned. When the alarm goes off, the OCM functionality will be checked by crew members.|$|E

Titanium dioxide (TiO 2), which is manufactured worldwide in large quantities {{for use in a}} wide range of applications, including pigment and cosmetic manufacturing, was once thought to be an inert material, but recently, more and more studies have indicated that TiO 2 nanoparticles (TiO 2 NPs) can cause inflammation and be harmful to humans by causing lung and brain problems.

Co-cultures of odontoblasts with trigeminal neurons indicate a clustering of alpha 2 and beta 2 sodium channel subunits and, at the sites of cell-cell contact, a co-localization of odontoblasts beta 2 subunits with peripherin. In vivo, sodium channels are expressed in odontoblasts. Ankyrin(G) and beta 2 co-localize, suggesting a link for signal transduction between axons and odontoblasts.
