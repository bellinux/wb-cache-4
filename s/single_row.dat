40|$|Graduation date: 1988 A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between double rows 15 cm apart on 76 cm centers and <b>single</b> <b>rows</b> 76 cm apart of 'Oregon 91 G' bush green beans {{at the same}} planting densities in three experiments in 1986 and 1987. There was {{a significant increase in}} yields of pods from double rows of 9 - 14 percent compared to <b>single</b> <b>rows</b> in two experiments. From the third experiment with low planting densities double rows gave an increase in pod yield of 3 percent, which was not significant. Individual plant dry weights and Leaf Area Index (LAI) were usually higher for plants in double rows compared to plants in <b>single</b> <b>rows.</b> Yield responses from increasing plant density were not consistent but highest yields were produced at densities of 35 - 50 plants/m². Plant dry weights decreased as density increased, while effects of density on LAI were not consistent. Planting of bush beans in double <b>rows</b> compared to <b>single</b> <b>rows</b> should result in no additional cost inputs except development of planters. Feasibility of adoption of this system of planting is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Performance of {{different}} summer fodders as intercrops in cotton was {{studied at the}} Agronomic Research Area, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad (Pakistan). Cotton was planted in 80 -cm apart <b>single</b> <b>rows</b> and 120 -cm spaced double row strips, while maize, sorghum, ricebean and cowpea fodders were intercropped {{in the space between}} 80 -cm apart <b>single</b> <b>rows</b> as well as 120 -cm spaced double row strips of cotton. The intercrops produced substantially smaller fresh weights in either planting pattern compared to the sole crop yields. However, intercropping system as a whole resulted in higher economic returns as compared to the sole crop of cotton. All the fodders intercropped in 120 -cm apart double row strips of cotton produced significantly higher fresh weight as compared to 80 -cm apart <b>single</b> <b>rows,</b> intercropping system...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} spatial {{arrangement}} and density on agronomic efficiency, yield and yield components, dry matter partitioning {{and growth of}} an annual cotton/cowpea/maize intercrop were examined in 1990 and 1991 in Tucson, Arizona. The 1990 experiment consisted of four spatial arrangements crossed with four densities of cowpea and maize in a complete factorial design. The 1991 experiment consisted of two densities of cowpea and maize selected from the 1990 experiment in the best spatial arrangement crossed with five densities of cotton in a complete factorial design. A land use efficiency of 12 % (or a land equivalent ratio of 1. 12) was obtained in the spatial arrangement of <b>single</b> <b>rows</b> of cowpea and maize between <b>singles</b> <b>rows</b> of cotton, whereas a land use efficiency of 11 % was obtained for cowpea and maize at a combined density of 50, 000 plants/ha intercropped with cotton at a density of 50, 000 plants/ha. Maize provided a greater contribution to the land use efficiency than either cotton or cowpea. Cotton yield was highest in the spatial arrangement of <b>single</b> <b>rows</b> of cowpea and maize between <b>single</b> <b>rows</b> of cotton. For the two food crops, cowpea yield was highest in the spatial arrangements in which cowpea and maize were grown in different rows between rows of cotton, whereas maize yield was highest in the spatial arrangements in which cowpea and maize were grown in the same rows between rows of cotton. Cotton fiber quality was not influenced by spatial arrangement, cowpea/maize density, and cotton density. Number of cowpea pods was affected by spatial arrangement {{in a manner similar}} to cowpea yield. Number of maize ears increased as cowpea/maize density increased, whereas number of kernels/ear, weight of 100 kernels and length of kernel rows decreased as cowpea/maize density increased. Dry matter accumulation in leaves, stems, and fruits of cotton and cowpea was greatest in the spatial arrangements in which cowpea and maize were grown in different rows between rows of cotton. Weekly cotton growth rate increased as cotton density increased from 39 to 74 days after sowing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Single</b> <b>rows</b> in STIS {{rectified}} spectral {{images are}} being analyzed in science programs where the highest obtainable spatial resolution is needed. Here we discuss two {{problems that have}} limited {{the accuracy of the}} rectified spectral images produced by the STScI pipeline: (1) the changing tilts of the spectral traces across the detector have not been taken into account, and (2) interpolation between rows of spectral images which are undersampled in the cross-dispersion direction has produced substantial artifacts in <b>single</b> <b>rows</b> of the rectified images. To address these problems, post-pipeline software is being developed to produce contemporary traces for science exposures, and the time evolution of traces is being characterized {{so that it can be}} incorporated into trace reference files. A technique of iteratively subdividing pixels in the cross-dispersion direction, using area interpolation instead of point interpolation, is being developed for a calibration routine which will produce improved rectified images. Preliminary results of the use of these new techniques will be presented here. 1...|$|R
