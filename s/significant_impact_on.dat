40|$|This study investigates firms' export {{behaviour}} in {{the manufacturing}} sector in Vietnam, using a Heckman sample selection model estimated over firm-level data in 2003 and 2004. Empirical results indicate that (i) firm-specific characteristics have <b>significant</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> firm export behaviour; (ii) there exist significant export spillovers from foreign direct investment (FDI) to domestic firms; and (iii) spillovers are heterogeneous and depend on firm characteristics, Firm age, private ownership, average wage and import intensity are found to have positive and <b>significant</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> the spillover magnitude, whereas firm size and domestic competition exert negative and <b>significant</b> <b>impacts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the impact of individual factors such as emotional intelligence (EI) and spiritual intelligence (SI) on the caring behavior of nurses. Methods A cross-sectional survey using questionnaire was conducted by sampling 550 nurses working in seven major public hospitals in Malaysia. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results The main findings are: (1) critical existential thinking and transcendental awareness dimensions of SI have <b>significant</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> assurance of human presence dimension of caring behavior; (2) personal meaning production and conscious state expansion dimensions of SI have <b>significant</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> perception of emotion and managing own emotions dimensions of EI; and (3) managing own emotions dimension of EI has <b>significant</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> respectful deference to other and assurance of human presence dimensions of caring behavior of nurses.

5|$|During {{symptomatic}} attacks, {{administration of}} {{high doses of}} intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile. Although, in general, effective {{in the short term}} for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to have a <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> long-term recovery. The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This {{research}} {{analyzed the}} current situation and future development trend in auto after-sales service industry. Then based on the five dimensions of service quality (fairness, empathy, reliability, responsiveness and convenience), three dimensions of relationship quality (satisfaction, trust and commitment), constructs a structural equation model to assess the relationship among service quality, relationship quality and relationship value. Researched on the samples from 327 customers in auto after-sales service industry, we found that fairness, empathy, reliability and convenience have <b>significant</b> positive <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> satisfaction, but responsiveness has no <b>significant</b> positive <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> satisfaction; {{at the same time}} satisfaction has a <b>significant</b> positive <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> trust, and trust has a <b>significant</b> positive <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> commitment. We also found satisfaction and commitment both have <b>significant</b> positive <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> relationship vale, but trust cannot influence relationship value directly.

Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV.
