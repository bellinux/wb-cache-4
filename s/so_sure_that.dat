5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham {{suggests that}} a synod, or ecclesiastical conference to discuss church affairs and rules, was held at London {{during the early years}} of the mission, possibly shortly after 603. Boniface, an Anglo-Saxon native who became a missionary to the continental Saxons, mentions such a synod being held at London. Boniface says that the synod legislated on marriage, which he discussed with Pope Gregory III in 742. Higham argues that because Augustine had asked for clarifications on the subject of marriage from Gregory the Great, it is likely that he could have held a synod to deliberate on the issue. Nicholas Brooks, another historian, is not <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> there was such a synod, but does not completely rule out the possibility. He suggests it might have been that Boniface was influenced by a recent reading of Bede's work.|$|E
25|$|Featherston blames blacks, and the {{powerful}} families that control the country, largely via the Whig Party, for causing the Confederate States to lose the Great War. His rise in politics {{to the position of}} President of the Confederate States was spurred on by his dream of overthrowing the status quo, and solving race relations in the country once and for all. Featherston is <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> blacks are a threat to the Confederacy that, even as the United States begins to win the war, he continues committing resources to the genocide against them.|$|E

500|$|McCain {{was almost}} killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. [...] While the air wing was {{preparing}} to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. [...] The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. [...] McCain later said, [...] "I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere." [...] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to {{the nose of the}} jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. [...] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestals ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20aircraft, and took 24hours to control. [...] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., [...] "It's a difficult thing to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship, I'm not <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam." [...] But such a change of course was unlikely; as McCain added, [...] "I always {{wanted to be in the}} Navy. I was born into it and I never really considered another profession. But I always had trouble with the regimentation." ...|$|E

[...] I'm sure he would have beaten Gonzales — Bobby was too quick, he had too much control for Pancho — and Laver and Rosewall and Hoad." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Bartelme {{took over}} as {{athletic}} director, Michigan had withdrawn from the Western Conference. One of his principle accomplishments was the return of Michigan to the conference. In September 1909, Barthelme made his views known:"I always have thought that Michigan's place is in the conference, and moreover, I have thought that when conditions were so we could return, {{it would be the}} only thing for us to do.

2500|$|Another {{shortcoming}} {{stemmed from}} Kahn's belief that scientists would work better {{in an open}} studio setting if given the chance. [...] He designed each floor of the laboratory towers potentially as one large room and trusted that the scientists would see the desirability of keeping it that way to encourage the interchange of ideas. [...] Most scientists disliked that approach, however, preferring privacy and even secrecy, so partitions {{were put in place}} on almost all floors. [...] Kahn was <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> his approach was the right one that he continued to speak of it afterwards as an important aspect of the design.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with syndicated columnist Billy Evans after the 1924 season, Blott asked the question: “Is it worth while for a college player to consider the professional game?” [...] Blott frankly noted, “I’m not <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> I am to be a star.” [...] Evans wrote {{that there were many}} “ifs” to such a question, including love of the game and other business prospects. [...] However, Evans noted that Blott was left with a decision as to whether to return to the Reds in 1925, realizing he would likely be “sitting on the bench as a substitute possessing just enough ability to fill in when one of the regulars was out of the lineup.” [...] Evans opined that it was a “waste of time” for a collegian to play such a role. [...] Evans later revealed that Blott had confided in him that he liked football best and would prefer to coach a grid team than play baseball.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1909, Michigan hired Philip Bartelme as the school's second {{athletic}} director following {{the resignation of}} Charles A. Baird. [...] The change in {{athletic director}}s led to speculation that Michigan might be prepared {{to return to the}} Western Conference. [...] In September 1909, Barthelme stated his intention to return Michigan to the conference, though he did not think the time was yet right. [...] He told the press, [...] "I always have thought that Michigan's place is in the conference, and moreover, I have thought that when conditions were so we could return, it would be the only thing for us to do. [...] However, I am not <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> that time has come." [...] He noted that the [...] "training table" [...] was the biggest obstacle to Michigan's rejoining the conference and contended that the training table was [...] "a great factor in getting the men into the condition necessary for hard football" [...] and avoiding serious injuries.|$|E

2500|$|Professor Wilson {{has stated}} that the 18-month gap is not unusual {{following}} a serial killer's first murder; Jeffrey Dahmer, for example, did not strike again for nine years after his first killing. Wilson investigated the case {{for three years and}} believes the available evidence supports that Peter Tobin is Bible John. He {{has stated that}} the moment he believed Tobin was Bible John occurred during Tobin's trial for the 1991 murder of Dinah McNicol. He compared the witness statements from McNicol's accomplice David Tremlett with Helen Puttock's sister McLachlan. Both witnesses emphasized the killer's propensity to project a socially superior persona; that he was a [...] "cut above everyone else". Wilson is <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> Tobin is Bible John, he states [...] "I didn't set out to prove Tobin was Bible John but I would stake my professional reputation on it." [...] Furthermore, Wilson states that Jean McLachlan's assertion that [...] "Bible John" [...] gave his surname as Templeton or Sempleson is uncannily coincidental as one of the pseudonyms used by Tobin was John Semple. However, when discussing her sister's killer many decades later, Jean dismissed Peter Tobin as Bible John stating emphatically that this was not the man she shared the taxi with.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{revealed}} in an ICC {{news conference on}} 25 August that after the game, Hair had offered his resignation from the ICC Elite Umpire Panel. In an e-mail entitled [...] "The Way Forward" [...] addressed to Doug Cowie, the ICC's umpire manager, and with apparent reference to an earlier conversation between the two which had not been made public by the ICC, Hair stated he would resign from his position {{in return for a}} non-negotiable one-off payment of US$500,000 directly into Hair's bank account. This was to be kept confidential by both sides. Hair was in contract with the ICC until March 2008, and the payment was said to compensate for the loss of future earnings and retainer payments. He subsequently revoked this offer. Hair had stated that the suggested sum was to be compensation for the four or more years he would have umpired for had the controversy not happened, which he claimed would be [...] "the best years he had to offer international umpiring". Hair had previously suggested, however, in an April 2006 interview that he might give up umpiring {{at the end of the}} World Cup saying [...] "I'm not <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> after another 12 months I'll have the passion to keep enjoying it." [...] In the press conference, the ICC's chairman Malcolm Speed did not offer any assurances about Hair's future.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s {{a fierce}} {{interchange}} {{took place between}} Gardner and Colin Wilson. [...] In The Quest for Wilhelm Reich Wilson wrote of this book(Gardner) writes about various kinds of cranks with the conscious superiority of the scientist, {{and in most cases}} one can share his sense of the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters this non-stop superiority begins to irritate; you begin to wonder about the standards that make him so certain he is always right. He asserts that the scientist, unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. So how can he be <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing rod to locate water? And that all the people he disagrees with are unbalanced fanatics? A colleague of the positivist philosopher A. J. Ayer once remarked wryly [...] "I wish I was as certain of anything as he seems to be about everything". Martin Gardner produces the same feeling. By Wilson's own account, up to that time he and Gardner had been friends, but Gardner took offence. In February 1989 Gardner wrote a letter published in The New York Review of Books describing Wilson as [...] "England’s leading journalist of the occult, and a firm believer in ghosts, poltergeists, levitations, dowsing, PK (psychokinesis), ESP, and every other aspect of the psychic scene". Shortly afterwards, Wilson replied, defending himself and adding [...] "What strikes me as so interesting is that when Mr. Gardner—and his colleagues of CSICOP—begin to denounce the 'Yahoos of the paranormal,' they manage to generate an atmosphere of such intense hysteria ...". Gardner in turn replied quoting his own earlier description of Wilson: [...] "The former boy wonder, tall and handsome in his turtleneck sweater, has now decayed into one of those amiable eccentrics for which the land of Conan Doyle is noted. They prowl comically about the lunatic fringes of science ..." ...|$|E
