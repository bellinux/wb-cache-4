5|$|Rebound is a two-player sports arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in February 1974.

5|$|The death scenes {{required}} {{varying degrees}} of 2D and 3D graphic enhancement, with the roller coaster scene alone being composed of 144 visual-effect shots. Custom-designed coaster cars were created and modified, based on events in the script. Most of the model was hand-built, with MEL scripts aiding specific elements. The coaster-crash scenes were filmed with the actors performing {{in front of a}} green <b>screen</b> <b>with</b> a CGI background. Several of the roller coaster's cars were suspended with bungee cords to film the crash, and the deaths required CGI onscreen effects; each actor had a corresponding CGI double.|$|E
5|$|The facades of English cathedrals show a {{considerable}} diversity, {{rather than a}} consistent progression, {{as is the case}} in Northern France and other cathedrals influenced by the French Gothic style.

5|$|Believing {{their first}} {{attempts}} {{to be too}} derivative, the developers held brain storming sessions. During a session, they agreed that one of Asteroidss favorable elements was its wrapping effect. They felt a game that allowed the player to fly off the screen would be exciting, and decided to create a game world larger than the screen displayed. The game's environment was made longer than the <b>screen,</b> <b>with</b> the visible area scrolling horizontally. Expanding on the idea, they envisioned a version of Space Invaders rotated 90degrees. By changing the orientation of Space Invaders design, the ship moved up and down while flying horizontally. Large asteroids, an element from Asteroids, were then added to the game world, but were later removed because the staff felt it lacked enjoyment. Jarvis intended the screen to scroll only from left to right; fellow Williams employee Steve Ritchie, however, convinced him the game {{should be able to}} scroll in either direction.|$|E
5|$|Blue's Clues {{was set in}} the home—the {{environment}} that was most familiar and secure for preschoolers—and looked like no other children's television show. Each episode was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs. Script drafts, once developed {{and approved by the}} show's creators and research team, were tested at public and private schools, day care centers, preschools, and Head Start programs by three researchers, who would narrate the story {{in the form of a}} storybook and take notes about the children's responses. The writers and creators revised the scripts based on this feedback. A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue <b>screen</b> <b>with</b> no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences' responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.|$|E

5|$|Iridion 3D {{features}} five {{types of}} weapons, with {{three levels of}} power each. Players boost weapon power by collecting powerups of the color that matches the current weapon. Collecting a different color gives the player the first level of that weapon type. If the player's ship is destroyed the power level of the weapon is reduced by one. Each weapon has advantages and disadvantages. The player starts with the red weapon, which is relatively weak but fires rapidly in a large spread. Green weapons are inaccurate but fill the <b>screen</b> <b>with</b> shots. Purple weapons spin in a counterclockwise motion slowly and are fairly strong. Yellow torpedo-like weapons are very powerful but powerups are rare and the weapon fires slowly. Blue weapons, a more powerful version of Yellow weapons, are found only on the last level. Flashing powerups restore the craft's shields.|$|E
5|$|Kates {{built the}} game to {{showcase}} his additron tube, a miniature version of the vacuum tube, though the transistor overtook it in computer development shortly thereafter. Patent issues prevented the additron tube from being used in computers besides Bertie before {{it was no longer}} useful. Bertie the Brain is a candidate for the first video game, as it was potentially the first computer game to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only three years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display. Berties use of light bulbs rather than a <b>screen</b> <b>with</b> real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.|$|E

40|$|Background Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic {{antibodies}} (ANCA) {{are associated}} with primary small vessel vasculitis (SVV). Proteinase- 3 (PR 3) -ANCA are primarily associated with Wegener granulomatosis, whereas myeloperoxidase (MPO) -ANCA are primarily associated with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and vasculitic Churg–Strauss syndrome. We evaluated whether a strategy {{that is based on}} <b>screening</b> <b>with</b> ELISA or fluoroenzymeimmunoassay (FEIA) is an accurate alternative to <b>screening</b> <b>with</b> indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). Methods C-ANCA and P-ANCA were determined by IIF and PR 3 -ANCA and MPO-ANCA were determined by ELISA (Inova) or FEIA (Phadia) on 326 patients (38 with newly diagnosed SVV and 288 diseased controls). Results Specificity and positive likelihood ratios were higher for ELISA and FEIA than for IIF. Post-test probability for SVV of a positive test result was higher for ELISA and FEIA than for IIF. Decision tree analysis in which several testing strategies were compared revealed that a testing strategy that is based on <b>screening</b> <b>with</b> ELISA or FEIA had an expected clinical utility that was comparable to <b>screening</b> <b>with</b> IIF and confirming with ELISA or FEIA. The highest expected clinical utility was found when both IIF and ELISA or FEIA were performed on all samples. Conclusions A strategy based on <b>screening</b> for ANCA <b>with</b> ELISA or FEIA (without prior IIF) is a valuable alternative to <b>screening</b> <b>with</b> IIF and confirming with ELISA or FEIA.
