25|$|Other {{diagnostic}} {{tests to determine}} the level of diabetic control are fructosamine and glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb) blood tests which can be useful especially if stress may be a factor. While anxiety or stress may influence the results of blood or urine glucose tests, both of these tests measure glycated proteins, which are not affected by them. Fructosamine testing provides information about blood glucose control for an approximate 2- to 4-week period, while GHb tests measure a 2- to 4-month period. Each of these tests has its own limitations and drawbacks and neither are intended to be replacements for blood glucose testing and curves, but are {{to be used to}} supplement the information gained from them. While HbA1c tests are a common diagnostic for diabetes in humans, there are no <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> for use of the test in animals. This means the information from them may not be reliable.|$|E

Then we shall have a vivid representation of three-dimensional spherical space, or, rather of three-dimensional spherical geometry. Here our spheres must be called [...] "rigid" [...] spheres. Their increase in size as they depart from S is not to be detected by measuring with measuring-rods, any more than {{in the case of the}} disc-shadows on E, because the <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> behave in the same way as the spheres.

60|$|As fancy pigeons are {{generally}} confined in aviaries of moderate size, and as even when not confined {{they do not}} search for their own food, they must during many generations have used their wings incomparably less than the wild rock-pigeon. Hence {{it seemed to me}} probable that all the parts of the skeleton subservient to flight would be found to be reduced in size. With respect to the sternum, I have carefully measured its extreme length in twelve birds of different breeds, and in two wild rock-pigeons from the Shetland Islands. For the proportional comparison I have tried three <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> with all twelve birds namely, the length {{from the base of the}} beak to the oil-gland, to the end of the tail, and from the extreme tip to tip of wings. The result has been in each case nearly the same, the sternum being invariably found to be shorter than in the wild rock-pigeon. I will give only a single table, as calculated by the standard from the base of the beak to the oil-gland; for the result in this case is nearly the mean between the results obtained by the two other standards.|$|E

60|$|The World State in {{this ideal}} {{presents}} {{itself as the}} sole landowner of the earth, with the great local governments I have adumbrated, the local municipalities, holding, as it were, feudally under it as landlords. The State or these subordinates holds all the sources of energy, and either directly or through its tenants, farmers and agents, develops these sources, and renders the energy available {{for the work of}} life. It or its tenants will produce food, and so human energy, and the exploitation of coal and electric power, and the powers of wind and wave and water will be within its right. It will pour out this energy by assignment and lease and acquiescence and what not upon its individual citizens. It will maintain order, maintain roads, maintain a cheap and efficient administration of justice, maintain cheap and rapid locomotion and be the common carrier of the planet, convey and distribute labour, control, let, or administer all natural productions, pay for and secure healthy births and a healthy and vigorous new generation, maintain the public health, coin money and sustain <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> subsidise research, and reward such commercially unprofitable undertakings as benefit the community as a whole; subsidise when needful chairs of criticism and authors and publications, and collect and distribute information. The energy developed and the employment afforded by the State will descend like water that the sun has sucked out of the sea to fall upon a mountain range, and back to the sea again it will come at last, debouching in ground rent and royalty and license fees, in the fees of travellers and profits upon carrying and coinage and the like, in death duty, transfer tax, legacy and forfeiture, returning to the sea. Between the clouds and the sea it will run, as a river system runs, down through a great region of individual enterprise and interplay, whose freedom it will sustain. In that intermediate region between the kindred heights and deeps those beginnings and promises will arise that are the essential significance, the essential substance, of life. From our human point of view the mountains and sea are for the habitable lands that lie between. So likewise the State is for Individualities. The State is for Individuals, the law is for freedoms, the world is for experiment, experience, and change: these are the fundamental beliefs upon which a modern Utopia must go.|$|E
