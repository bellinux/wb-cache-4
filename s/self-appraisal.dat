2500|$|The {{success of}} [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] led CBS Records to renew Jones' {{recording}} contract and sparked {{new interest in}} the singer. He {{was the subject of}} an hour-and-a-quarter-long HBO television special entitled George Jones: With a Little Help from His Friends, which saw him performing songs with Waylon Jennings, Elvis Costello, Tanya Tucker, and Tammy Wynette, among others. Jones continued drinking and using cocaine, appearing at various awards shows to accept honors for [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] arguably inebriated, like when he performed [...] "I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool" [...] with Barbara Mandrell at the 1981 Country Music Association Awards. [...] He was involved in several high-speed car chases with police, which were reported on the national news, and one arrest was filmed by a local TV crew; the video, which is widely available online, offers a glimpse into Jones' alter ego when drinking, as he argues with the police officer and lunges at the camera man. Conversely, when sober, Jones was known to be friendly and down to earth, even shy. [...] In a 1994 article on Jones, Nick Tosches remarked that when he first interviewed the singer in April 1976, [...] "One could readily believe the accounts by those who had known him for years: that he had not changed much at all and that he had been impervious to fame and fortune." [...] In an unusually unguarded <b>self-appraisal</b> in 1981, the singer told Mark Rose of The Village Voice, [...] "I don't show a lot of affection. [...] I have probably been a very unliked person among family, like somebody who was heartless. [...] I saved it all for the songs. [...] I didn't know you were supposed to show that love person to person. [...] I guess I always wanted to, but I didn't know how. [...] The only way I could would be {{to do it in a}} song." [...] Years later he commented to The Christian Broadcasting Network's Scott Ross about himself, [...] "I think you're mad at yourself, I think that you're sayin' to yourself 'You don't deserve this. [...] You don't deserve those fans. [...] You don't deserve makin' this money.' [...] And you're mad at yourself. [...] And you beat up on yourself by drinkin' and losing friends that won't put up with that...It's just one terrible big mess you make out of your life." [...] In 1982, Jones recorded the album A Taste of Yesterday's Wine with Merle Haggard; [...] while Jones, in the wake of his condition, appeared underweight on the album cover, his singing was flawless. [...] His run of hits also continued in the early 1980s, with the singer charting [...] "I'm Not Ready Yet", [...] "Same Ole Me" [...] (backed by the Oak Ridge Boys)", [...] "Still Doin' Time", [...] "Tennessee Whiskey", [...] "We Didn't See a Thing" [...] (a duet with Ray Charles), and [...] "I Always Get Lucky with You", which was Jones' last number one in 1984.|$|E
40|$|Aims: The Schematic Appraisals Model of Suicide (SAMS) {{suggests}} that positive <b>self-appraisals</b> {{may be important}} for buffering suicidal thoughts and behaviours, potentially providing a key source of resilience. The current study aimed to explore whether positive <b>self-appraisals</b> buffered individuals from suicidality {{in the face of}} stressful life events. Method: 78 participants who reported experiencing some degree of suicidality were recruited from a student population. They completed a battery of questionnaires including measures of suicidality, stressful life events and positive <b>self-appraisals.</b> Results: Positive <b>self-appraisals</b> moderated the association between stressful life events and suicidality. For those reporting moderate or high levels of positive <b>self-appraisals,</b> raised incidence of stressful life events did not lead to increases in suicidality. Discussion: These results support the SAMS framework, and suggest that positive <b>self-appraisals</b> may confer resilience to suicide. Positive <b>self-appraisals</b> may be a promising avenue for further resilience research, and an important area to target for suicide interventions...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen growing {{interest}} into concepts of resilience, but minimal research has explored resilience to suicide and none has investigated resilience to suicide amongst clinical groups. The current study aimed to examine whether a proposed resilience factor, positive <b>self-appraisals</b> {{of the ability to}} cope with emotions, difficult situations and the ability to gain social support, could buffer against the negative impact of hopelessness amongst individuals with psychosis-spectrum disorders when measured cross-sectionally. Seventy-seven participants with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders completed self-report measures of suicidal ideation, hopelessness and positive <b>self-appraisals.</b> Positive <b>self-appraisals</b> were found to moderate the association between hopelessness and suicidal ideation. For those reporting high levels of positive <b>self-appraisals,</b> increased levels of hopelessness were significantly less likely to lead to suicidality. These results provide cross-sectional evidence suggest that positive <b>self-appraisals</b> may buffer individuals with psychosis against the pernicious impact of a well known clinical risk factor, hopelessness. Accounting for positive <b>self-appraisals</b> may improve identification of individuals at high risk of suicidality, and may be an important area to target for suicide interventions...|$|R
40|$|All {{individuals}} seek {{to develop}} and maintain social relationships (Baumeister 2 ̆ 6 Leary, 1995). The extent to which people feel loved and accepted within their relationships is called perceived relational value (Leary, 2001). I argue that because sociocultural norms equate physical appearance and social acceptance for women (Thompson, 1999), women’s perceived relational value is inordinately linked to their <b>self-appraisals</b> of physical appearance. I also suggest that significant relational consequences can result from this association. In Study 1, 1 demonstrated that <b>self-appraisals</b> of physical attractiveness and Body Mass Index predicted perceived relational value among women but not men. In Study 2, 1 found that appearance <b>self-appraisals</b> have a causal impact on perceived relational value among women. I also demonstrated that one consequence of lowered perceived relational value is decreased romantic relationship standards. Study 3 replicated the impact of appearance <b>self-appraisals</b> on relationship standards. Moreover, perceived relational value within a romantic relationship mediated the relation between <b>self-appraisals</b> and relationship standards. Study 4 examined a second consequence of lower perceived relational value: the desire for social contact. A model delineating the relation between appearance <b>self-appraisals,</b> perceived relational value and desire for social contact, such that appearance <b>self-appraisals</b> were linked to lower perceived relational value, which, in turn was linked to a decreased desire for social contact, was tested and the model {{was found to be}} a good fit. Overall, these findings indicate that in addition to the behavioural and personal consequences of sociocultural norms for appearance, there are also relational consequences...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigated}} {{the contribution of the}} reflected appraisal process to the ontogeny of children's self-perceptions of physical competence. Emanating from symbolic interactionist thought, reflected appraisals refer to individuals' perceptions of others' evaluations of their abilities. The influence of parents' appraisals of their child's competence on the child's <b>self-appraisals</b> was hypothesized to be mediated by parents' reflected appraisals. Data were collected from a sample of 147 sixth graders and their parents in three waves over one school year. Structural equation modeling revealed that (1) parents' appraisals at Wave 1 influenced children's reflected appraisals of parents at Wave 2; (2) reflected appraisals at Wave 2 influenced children's <b>self-appraisals</b> at Wave 3, controlling for both the child's actual level in sport (as assessed by the child's grade in physical education) and the child's <b>self-appraisals</b> at Wave 1; and (3) the influence of parents' appraisals on their child's <b>self-appraisals</b> was nonsignificant when reflected appraisals were controlled for. This study supported the mediational role of the reflected appraisal process.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{possible}} risk and protective correlates of suicidality amongst self-injuring individuals. Using self-reported survey responses from 323 self-injuring participants, a cross-sectional internet web-based design was employed to determine whether attachment, self-forgiveness and positive <b>self-appraisals</b> significantly predicted suicidality in self-injurers. Results indicated that dismissing attachment was positively associated with suicidality; emotion coping and support seeking positive <b>self-appraisals</b> negatively predicted suicidality, as did self-forgiveness. Findings indicate that the perceived ability to cope with emotions and gain support and the ability to self-forgive may protect against suicidality in self-injurers. Conversely the presence of dismissing attachment may increase the risk of suicidality. In the long term investigations such as this could better inform theory, assessment and treatment of suicidality in self-injurers. Replication of these results in a longitudinal design with more ethnically and age diverse samples and balance of gender is needed to strengthen the confidence in the present study’s findings and to further explore the relationship between these constructs and suicidality. In addition, studies establishing the importance of Attachment, Self-forgiveness and Positive <b>self-appraisals</b> constructs role in moderating the impact of risk on suicidality are needed to further delve into the relationship between these proposed constructs and suicidality in self-injurers...|$|R

Behavioral results indicated people used fewer positive adjectives, more negative adjectives, recalled more specific events coming to mind and felt more psychologically connected to the near future self than the distant future self. Electrophysiological results demonstrated that negative trait adjectives elicited more positive ERP deflections than did positive trait adjectives in the interval between 550 and 800 ms (late positive component) within the near future self condition. However, within the same interval, {{there were no significant differences}} between negative and positive traits adjectives in the distant future self condition.

Self-perceived competence in the parental role may be an important mediator of family interventions.

To do so, the authors analyzed data from several large-sample trials of a family intervention that focused on improving parent and child <b>self-appraisals,</b> among other outcomes. In both trials, parent self-efficacy increased significantly. Both punishment and coercive interactions declined. The role of self-efficacy as a mediator was examined through regression analyses. Baseline self-efficacy was not a significant predictor of changes in child rearing, but the baseline child rearing measure was. Across both trials and all outcome measures, changes in self-efficacy accounted for significant variance in improved child rearing. Thus, the intervention resulted in improved self-efficacy, and such changes explained improved parenting skills.

40|$|Purpose: We {{explored}} self-rated {{health by}} using a meaning-centered theoretical foundation. <b>Self-appraisals,</b> such as self-rated health, reflect a cultural process of identity formation, whereby identities are multiple, simultaneously individual and collective, and produced by specific historical formations. Anthropological research in Philadelphia determined (a) how African American elders appraise their health, and (b) how health evaluations reflect cultu-ral and historical experiences within a community. Design and Methods: We interviewed and ob-served 35 adults aged 65 to 80, stratified by gender and self-rated health. We validated theme analysis of focused interview questions against the larger data set of field notes and transcripts. Results: Health appraisal reflected a complex process of adaptation and identity. Criteria for health included: indepen-dent functioning, physical condition, control and responsibility for health, and overall feeling. Evalua-tive rationales that shaped health appraisals were comparisons, restricted possibilities for self-evalua-tion, and ways of handling adversity. Evaluative rationales mitigated undesirable health identities (including low self-reported health) and provided mechanisms for claiming desired health identities despite adversity. Implications: Describing the cri-teria and evaluative rationales underlying <b>self-appraisals</b> of health extends current understandings of self-rated health and illustrates the sociohistorical context of individual assessments of well-being...|$|R

Understanding psychological mechanisms contributing to low rates of participation in physical activities for boys with developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD) is a clinical and research priority with potential to inform clinical interventions and preventive health initiatives. Method Sixty boys aged 10 - 13 years with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of PFL and life satisfaction.
