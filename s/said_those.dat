5|$|After the team’s 44 finish, Michigan {{dismissed}} Harry Kipke as head coach. Anderson, {{described by}} Heikkinen as the “greatest line technician in football today,” also resigned as line coach. Asked about rumors that players {{did not like}} Kipke, Heikkinen <b>said</b> <b>those</b> reports were probably originated by disgruntled players who {{did not make the}} squad or were in other ways dissatisfied. However, just over a year later, in February 1939, Heikkinen led the opposition when Kipke ran for the University’s Board of Regents and campaigned actively for Kipke’s opponent.|$|E

AI said complete destruction affected 164 houses with 374 apartment units, and that other buildings had been partially destroyed. Israel <b>said</b> <b>those</b> numbers were exaggerations.|$|E

Further emails released showed Government ministers knew a deal had been reached {{a week before the}} protest, despite claiming negotiations were still happening.|$|E
25|$|Franz {{argues that}} the threat of {{expulsion}} for expressing disagreement with the Watch Tower Society's teachings is designed to create a sterile atmosphere in which the organization's teachings and policies can circulate without the risk of confronting serious questioning or adverse evidence. The result, according to Holden, is that individuals may spend most of their lives suppressing doubts for fear of losing their relationships with friends and relatives. Penton describes the system of judicial committees and the threat of expulsion as the ultimate control mechanism among the Witnesses; Holden claims that shunning not only rids the community of defilement, but deters others from dissident behavior. Sociologist Ronald Lawson has also noted that the group allows little room for independence of thought, and no toleration of doctrinal diversity. He <b>said</b> <b>those</b> who deviate from official teachings are readily expelled and shunned.|$|E

500|$|The most {{important}} evidence was {{the testimony of}} lenders, many of them elderly retirees, who had loaned a total of $661,300 to help LaRouche fight the [...] "war on drugs" [...] but only received $10,000 in repayment. One of the prosecutors, John Markham, <b>said</b> <b>those</b> loans represented [...] "just a very small portion of unrepaid borrowing". Other testimony asserted that, as of 1987, half of the $4million borrowed by the 1984 presidential campaign was unpaid, and that only $5million had been repaid out of $30million in non-campaign loans. LaRouche supporters claim the unrepaid amount was $294,000 but, according to testimony at trial, the amount owed by 1987 topped $25million.|$|E

[...] This is a strategy designed to help motivate Jackson to play better. Tom Maher who was the coach her called her up said [...] "She's so good she could be the greatest sportswoman in the world.

Parker and Stone considered [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride" [...] their favorite episode of the first season, and they credit it with helping elevate the credibility and relevance of South Park during {{the early days of}} the series. Although the first season of South Park received a lot of criticism from commentators who felt the show was disgusting and offensive, Parker specifically defended the episodes [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] and [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", which he felt included moral values and a [...] "sweet side to it" [...] among the sophomoric humor. Stone also <b>said</b> <b>those</b> two episodes became the specific shows people would most talk about when they discussed South Park.|$|E
500|$|Quintanilla, Jr. held {{a meeting}} on March 9, 1995, with Selena and Suzette Quintanilla at Q-Productions to confront Saldívar. Quintanilla, Jr. {{presented}} Saldívar with evidence concerning the missing funds. He said Saldívar simply stared at him without answering any of his questions. Quintanilla, Jr. told Saldívar he would involve police {{if she did not}} produce evidence that disproved his accusations. When Quintanilla, Jr. asked her why fans were not receiving the promised gift packages, Saldívar <b>said</b> <b>those</b> fans were trying to get the items for free. Quintanilla, Jr. discovered Saldívar had opened the fan club's bank account under her sister's name, [...] "Maria Elida". When asked why she had done this, she replied that the bank would not allow her to open an account in her name; she did not know the reason for this refusal. Saldívar abruptly left the meeting. Quintanilla, Jr. then banned Saldívar from contacting Selena. However, Selena did not want to end their friendship; she felt Saldívar was essential to the success of her clothing line in Mexico. Selena also wanted to keep Saldívar close because she had bank records, statements, and financial records necessary for tax purposes.|$|E
500|$|Some campaigning by party {{workers of}} the True Finns caused {{controversy}} over {{the nature of their}} actions. Most complaints emanated from the Helsinki region. Jussi Saramo of the Left Alliance in the Uusimaa electoral district said of their actions that [...] " [...] I have been involved in politics for 12 years and I have never seen such excesses." [...] This followed an event in Korso in Vantaa where he parked his campaign trailer in a spot the True Finns said was reserved for party chairman Timo Soini. True Finns' candidate Mika Niikko however <b>said</b> <b>those</b> involved in the spat were no longer working for his campaign and he apologised to Saramo despite maintaining his stance that the placement of the trailer was a deliberate provocation: [...] "I do not approve of being provoked when someone tries to provoke;" [...] he also added that the volunteers working for the True Finns campaign come [...] "from here and there" [...] and {{it was not possible to}} verify everyone beforehand. He further added a claim that True Finns supporters have also been targets of aggressive behaviour. [...] "A month ago we were not verbally abused, but now you can hear all kinds of language." [...] The Social Democrats' foreign-born candidate Ranbir Sodhi was allegedly confronted by True Finns supporters in the Myyrmäki district of Vantaa who were said to have told him to go back [...] "to his own country" [...] where he could become a politician. A week after the confrontations, however, he said that [...] "the same guys came to Tikkurila to apologise." [...] The National Coalition Party MP Raija Vahasalo also complained that during a campaign event in Kirkkonummi the True Finns handed out leaflets at the same time that claimed she favoured Swedish-speaking residents in allocating local school funding. The action was due to two local members of the True Finns who are not running to become MPs. The chairman of Kirkkonummi True Finns and a candidate in the election Pekka Sinisalo said he confiscated the remainder of the leaflets. [...] "I do not approve of attacking Vahasalo’s person. Election fever sometimes leads to these kinds of excesses." [...] This was controversial as negative campaigning is unusual in Finnish elections. In response to such actions the party secretaries of the largest political parties held a meeting to discuss certain ground rules for the rest of the campaign, however the True Finns' Ossi Sandvik could not make it.|$|E
