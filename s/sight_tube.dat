50|$|Noon sights {{obtain the}} observer's Latitude. It is {{impossible}} to determine longitude with an accuracy better than 10nm {{by means of a}} noon sight. A noon sight is called a Meridian Altitude. While it is very easy to determine the observer's latitude at noon without knowing the exact time, longitude cannot accurately be measured at noon. At noon the sun's change of altitude is very slow, so determining the exact time that the sun is at its zenith by direct observation is impossible, and therefore it {{is impossible to}} obtain an accurate longitude at the moment of Zenith. However, it is possible to determine the time of zenith for longitude with a useful accuracy by performing a mean time of observation when the sun is on its ascent and descent prior to and following its moment of Zenith. By taking a sextant reading within 15 to 30 minutes prior to local noon (zenith) and noting the time, then leaving the sextant set to the same angle and subsequently observing the moment in time at which the sun passes through the <b>sight</b> <b>tube</b> on its descent from Zenith between a half-hour and hour later, the two times can be averaged to obtain a longitude sufficiently accurate for navigation (within 2nm).|$|E

The award occurred in two phases. Phase 1, which involved designing, building and bench testing, {{was completed in}} September 2000, and the Phase 1 report was issued in March 2001. Phase 2 was completed in 2005, {{and the results of}} the field test are contained in this final report. Two test campaigns were made. In the first one, the pyrometer was sighted into the gasifier. It performed well for a brief period of time and then experienced difficulties in keeping the <b>sight</b> <b>tube</b> open due to a slag accumulation which developed around the opening of the <b>sight</b> <b>tube</b> in the gasifier wall. In the second test campaign, the pyrometer was sighted into the top of the radiant syngas cooler through an unused soot blower lance. The pyrometer experienced no more problems with slag occlusions, and the readings were continuous and consistent. However, the pyrometer readings were 800 to 900 F lower than the gasifier thermocouple readings, which is consistent with computer simulations of the temperature distribution inside the radiant syngas cooler. In addition, the pyrometer readings were too sluggish to use for control purposes. Additional funds beyond what were available in this contract would be required to develop a solution that would allow the pyrometer to be used to measure the temperature inside the gasifier...|$|E

40|$|A {{very fine}} Octant’ from the {{collection}} of an eighteenth-century Amsterdam regent The Utrecht University Museum owns an octant made by Jonathan Sisson, an eighteenth-century London scientific instrument maker. The device was acquired in 1776 by Utrecht University at the auction sale of the instrument collection of Gerard Aernout Hasselaer, an Amsterdam regent, who held important posts at Dutch admiralties and the Amsterdam Chamber of the Dutch East-India Company (VOC). The octant had been invented in 1731 by John Hadley, a vice-president of the Royal Society of London. Sisson made one of the first copies, which was put at the test at sea the following year. This try out proved to be a success, and octants soon replaced older instruments for measurements of the altitude of celestial bodies above the horizon at sea. The Dutch Republic {{was one of the first}} countries outside Britain where the octant was introduced. Among others, this introduction was stimulated by contacts between scientific instrument makers in both countries. In 1735 for instance, the Leiden instrument maker Jan van Musschenbroek was the first Dutchman to sell octants. It is known that he had business contacts with Sisson. In 1737 the octant was used for the first time on the Dutch vessel Teijlingen of the Amsterdam Admiralty. These developments occurred at a time that officials in the Dutch Republic became increasingly aware that the knowledge and practice of navigation on Dutch ships lay well behind those used at British ships. Dutch seamen and scholars drew up reports, pointing at the lagging of knowledge, and among others recommended the use of octants. These recommendations soon led to improvements, such as the founding of a navigational school in Amsterdam and the publication of a Dutch manual on its ships. Then these instruments were bought from Van Musschenbroek. Three years later the Company purchased octants from Benjamin Ayres, a former apprentice and brother-in- law of Sisson, working in Amsterdam since 1743. VOC governor Hasselaer played a stimulating role in this process of navigational improvements, being also the official representative of Prince William IV in three Dutch Admiralties. Hasselaer’s instrument collection reflects his interest, containing octants by both Sisson and Ayres. Sisson’s copy is particularly interesting because it has a number of technical devices, which are not found on contemporary octants. It has a brass frame with a wooden handle on the back, and two on either side for steadying the heavy instrument, a rack and pinion for slow-motion movement of the index arm, different types of adjustment for the mirrors, and a <b>sight</b> <b>tube</b> as well as a sight-vane. These devices are only found on octants by Sissons’s pupil Ayres, and on instruments made by others from the 1750 s onwards. It is unlikely that Sisson’s example was intended for use at sea, for it was too heavy and probably also too expensive. Technically the instrument was well ahead of its time, suggesting that it was made specially for Hasselaer, perhaps at a time when the Company was contemplating the adoption of octants for its ships. </p...|$|E
40|$|Uma {{autoclave}} vertical Dixie de escala pilota (300 L) foi modificada para permitir o tratamento térmico de bolsas esterilizáveis, fis modifíeações envolveram a instalação de uma linha de injeção de ar na tubulação de entrada de vapor, a construção de 10 pratel eiras para o uonfinaííiento de até 30 bolsa de 110 x 150 mm (dimensões internas) e 20 rom de espessura máxima, a instalação de um indicador de nivel de água e de uma tubulação de desaeração. Para simular bolsas contendo alimentos foram construídos blocos de nylon- 6 de 15 x 110 x 130 mm. Durante seleção dos meios de aquecimento para bolsas esterilizáveis, foram realizados ensaias de distribuição de calor a 105, 113 e 121 º C na mutoclave carregada cosi 30 blocos simuladores utilizando corao meios de aquecimento, vapor puro (meio padrão), misturas vapor/ar com 70 e 90 % de vapor e água aquecida com vapor com uma sobrepressão de ar igual utilizada para ab misturas vapor/ar. A temperatura de 121 º C permitiu um controle mais estável conduzindo ás melhores distribuições de calor. Para esta temperatura o vapor puro apresentou uma excelente distribuicão de calor com diferenças de temperatura não maiores que 0, 6 º C cumprindo com o sugerido pela Food and Drug Administration", seguido por mistura com 90 % de vapor, água com sobrepressão a 126 kPa, água com sobrepressão a 191 kPa e mistura com 70 % de vapor. Esta mistura vapor/ar, foi descartada por não ter atingido estabilidade durante o "tempo de processo", com diferenças de temperaturas de até 2 º C e ocorrência de pontos frios na metade superior do conjunto de prateleiras. A seleção dos meios de aquecimento Foi completada com ensaios de penetracão de calor a 121 º C em blocos simuladores. A penetração de calor dos blocos, em água com sobrapressão a 126 ou 191 kPa foi muito lenta, decorrente do longo tempo de subida. Isto impossibilitou o cálculo das taxas e fatores de atraso do aquecimento (fh e jh, respectivamente). Consequentemente, este meio de aquecimento foi descartado para o estudo da penetração de calor em bolsas no sistema modificado. Não foram detectadas diferenças significativas (&# 945;= 0, 005) nos "fh", "jh", "fc" ou jc, de blocos instalados sobre as prateleiras 2 ou 6 processados em vapor puro ou mistura com 90 % de vapor. Consequentemente, a mistura com 90 % de vapor foi selecionada como o melhor meio de aquecimento para os experimentos com bolsas esterilizáveis. Bolsas contendo 160 g de suspensão aquosa de bentonita 10 % (p/p) e de 1 a 33 mL de ar residual foram esterilizados 15 mín. A 121 ° C em mistura com 90 % de vapor na autoclave modificada. As soldas de fundo e lateral cumpriram com as sugestões s da Food and Drug Administration" referentes à integridade, podendo ser consideradas como de "Alto Desempenho". As bolsas com i a 11 mL de ar residual apresentaram as seguintes características melhor aspecto visual, aquecimento e resfriamento mais rápidos com os menores "fh" e "fc" e o máximo valor de Fo". Porém, quando comparadas com as bolsas contendo de 12 a 33 mL de ar residual estas diferenças não foram significativas (&# 945;= 0, 005). A Dixie vertical retort (pilot size, 300 L) {{was modified}} for retort pouch sterilization. The modification involved {{the installation of}} a line to inject air into the steam inlet Pipe, {{the construction of a}} rack with 10 trays confining up to 30 pouches with 110 x 150 mm (internal dimensions) and allowing up to 20 mm of thickness, the installation of a glass <b>sight</b> <b>tube</b> and one stell pipe for venting. Blocks of nylon- 6 with 15 x 110 x 150 mm were constructed simulating retort pouches containing foods. Heating media for retort pouches were selected through heat distribution tests at 105, 113 and 121 º C in a full retort with 30 simulative blocks heated in the following media. pure steam (as pattern), steam/air mixtures with 70 e 90 % steam and water heated by steam with air overpressure at the same level as steam/air mixtures. Temperature of 121 º C allowed the most stable control with the best heat distributions. For this temperature pure steam showed an excellent heat distribution with temperature differences no higher than 0. 6 ° C in agreement with the suggestion of Food and Drug Administration, followed by mixture with 90 % steam, water with overpressure at 126 kPa, water with overpressure at 191 kPa and mixture with 70 % steam. This mixture was discarded because it did not achieve stabilization during "processing time", with differences up to 2 º C and cold points in the upper half of the rack. Heating media selection was completed with heat penetration tests at 121 º C with simulating blocks. Heat penetration m water at 126 and 191 kPa were very slow because of the long come up time, that did not allow the calculation of heating rates and lag factors (fh and jh respectively). Therefore, water was discarded for further heat penetration tests in retort pouches in thy modified retort. No significant differences (&# 945;= 0, 005) among "fh", "jh", "fc" ou "jc" parameters were detected for simulative blocks processed in pure steam or mixture with 90 % steam on tray 2 or 6. Therefore mixtures with 90 % steam were selected as the best heating media for the experiments in retort pouches. Pouches containing 160 g of bentonite 10 % (w/w) in water and 1 to 33 mL of residual sir were sterilized 15 min at 121 º C in mixture with 90 % steam m the modified retort. Lateral and bottom seals have attained the recommendation for integrity of the Food and Drug Administration end can be considered as "High Performance" seals. Pouches with 1 to 11 mL of residual air showed the best visual appearance, the fastest heating and cooling with the lower "fh" e "fc" and highest "Fo" value, but if compared against packages with 12 a 33 mL of residual air, these differences were not significatives (&# 945;= 0, 005) ...|$|E

50|$|When Shen Kuo {{became the}} Supervisor of the Directorate of Astronomy in 1072 AD, Wei Pu became Shen's protege, and {{was eager to}} partake in Shen's ideal reforms to the Chinese {{calendar}} system. With the aid of many different scholars and a large assortment of gathered books written on astronomy, Shen and Wei embarked on this enormous project. With the aid of Wei Pu, Shen planned to make a series of nightly astronomical observations {{over a period of}} five years. To allow more accurate astronomical observations and recordings, Shen Kuo improved the technical designs of the rotating armillary sphere, the gnomon, the clepsydra clock, and the <b>sighting</b> <b>tube.</b> Shen Kuo calibrated the standard diameter of the <b>sighting</b> <b>tube's</b> width, hence allowing the observation of the pole star indefinitely (which had shifted since the time of Zu Geng in the 5th century). With these, Shen and Wei attempted to predict the mean speeds of the planets as well as the accurate positions of the planets in their orbits. They established a system of observing and recording on a star map the exact coordinates of the planets, done three times a night for a total of five years. Shen Kuo made a cosmological hypotheses in explaining the variations of planetary motions, including the concept of retrogradation. On the other hand, Wei Pu realized that the old calculation technique for the mean sun was inaccurate compared to the apparent sun, since the latter was ahead of it in the accelerated phase of motion, and behind it in the retarded phase. Hence, he incorporated solar motion into the eclipse theory.|$|R

He also improved the designs of astronomical instruments such as the widened astronomical <b>sighting</b> <b>tube,</b> which allowed Shen Kuo to fix the position of the pole star (which had shifted over centuries of time).

5|$|Su Song {{also created}} a {{celestial}} atlas (in five separate maps), which had the hour circles between the xiu (lunar mansions) forming the astronomical meridians, with stars marked in an equidistant cylindrical projection {{on each side of}} the equator, and thus, was in accordance to their north polar distances. Furthermore, Su Song must have taken advantage of the astronomical findings of his political rival and contemporary astronomer Shen Kuo. This is so because Su Song's fourth star map places the position of the pole star halfway between Tian shu (−350 degrees) and the current Polaris; this was the more accurate calculation (by 3 degrees) that Shen Kuo had made when he observed the pole star over a period of three months with his width-improved <b>sighting</b> <b>tube.</b> There were many star maps written before Song's book, but the greatest significance of these star maps by Su Song is, that they represent the oldest extant star maps in printed form.|$|R
