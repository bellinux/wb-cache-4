Exposure to heavy smoke concentrations {{of any kind}} {{for an extended period}} (particularly if near the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>emission)</b> has the potential to cause illness or death. White phosphorus smoke irritates the eyes, mucous membranes of the nose, and respiratory tract in moderate concentrations, while higher concentrations can produce severe burns. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has set an acute inhalation Minimum Risk Level (MRL) for {{white phosphorus}} smoke of 0.02 mg/m3, the same as fuel-oil fumes. By contrast, the chemical weapon mustard gas is 30 times more potent: 0.0007 mg/m3. However, the agency states that the 1935 study used to determine the MRL was insufficient to accurately assess the health risk to humans. No studies have investigated the lethal effects of inhalation of WP by humans, however a former US soldier has stated that breathing in smoke close to a shell caused the throat and lungs to blister until the victim suffocated, with the phosphorus continuing to burn them from the inside.|$|E
