50|$|The {{first patent}} issued was for <b>ignition</b> <b>cables,</b> citing prior art for other {{non-metallic}} conductive materials {{and their ability}} to reduce RF interference related problems. These cables consisted of a graphite/resin composite conductor strands and a protective silicone sheaf. The strands were to be twisted together and drawn through the liquid matrix material, finally being surrounded by the sheaf. The two parts would be extruded together to form the cable and ensure a well bound structure of thousands of individual graphite composite filaments.|$|R
2500|$|On Tuesday, 29 April 1941, the Flitfires left Flushing Airport {{and were}} ferried to LaGuardia Field {{in groups of}} six (plus {{squadron}} leader) flying in close formation. [...] The normal $2.50 landing fee was waived by Mayor LaGuardia. Traffic was handled by airport cars using two way radios. Each aircraft was equipped with a portable radio loaned by Lear Avia Inc. Control of the flights was possible through these radio sets, despite the fact the Flitfires were not equipped with external antennas or <b>shielded</b> <b>ignitions.</b> [...] The Flitfire Brigade's New York landing was the largest mass landing ever attempted up to that time.|$|R
5000|$|ETCO {{released}} a technical report detailing results of comparative testing conducted at their R&D facility. This report titled “Under the Boot” was published {{after a series}} of consumer complaints, research and articles involving Coil on Plug ignition systems. There were also Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) issued by automobile manufacturers from automotive manufacturers including Acura/Honda that caused the company to release the white paper on this research. The main focus of the research looked at the spring like connection devices. The connection devices used to supply the current's path from coil to plug were not as robust as the [...] "mated fit" [...] terminal to terminal connections required on wired ignition systems. These Coil on Plug devices do not have the retention values demanded by SAE ( [...] Society Automotive Engineers [...] ) Standard J2032 3.2.1 for High Voltage <b>Ignition</b> <b>cable</b> assemblies. Proponents of Coil on Plug technology cite cost and ease of use as primary advantages when compared to standard wire assemblies.|$|R
40|$|Air Traffic Control (ATC) {{and their}} {{responsible}} authorities have been always {{very sensitive to}} safety of the systems they are using to guarantee a fool-proof and environmentally safe operation of the facilities to provide air traffic services and guidance for the airplanes. This paper deals with the influence of random systems like badly <b>shielded</b> <b>ignition</b> systems of cars and motorbikes on standard air-ground aviation communication systems. Following a series of theoretical simulations, a measurement campaign quantifying this influence is described. This campaign is shedding {{some light on the}} fundamental behaviour and mechanisms of the RF disturbances caused by (shielded and unshielded) spark plug systems. It will be investigated both in the time domain and in the frequency domain. An analysis of the inaccuracies of those measurements is performed and the influence of (shielded and unshielded) spark plug systems on aviation communication systems (still based on A(mplitude) M(odulation)) is explained in detail. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The D.III {{featured}} a rather prominent overhead cam operating the single {{intake and exhaust}} valves, powered by a shaft running up from the crankshaft {{at the rear of}} the engine. Ignition was provided by two sets of spark plugs, one located on either side of the cylinders, each powered by a separate magneto for redundancy. The <b>ignition</b> <b>cables</b> were protected in tubes running down either side of the cylinders. Fuel was fed into the cylinders via pipes on the port side of the engine, supplied from a twin-barrel carburetor located just above the crankcase. Both the fuel and oil reservoirs were pressurized by an air compressor run off the crank.The only obvious design change from the earlier D.II was to use separate cooling jackets for each cylinder, whereas the D.II used one jacket each for a trio of adjacent pairs of cylinders. Daimler also used the pistons of the D.III to produce the reduction geared, eight-cylinder 220 hp Mercedes D.IV during this period, but it did not see widespread use. The lengthened crankshaft of the D.IV proved prone to breaking.|$|R
5|$|Despite these {{production}} {{problems and}} the fact that the I-250 had yet even to be submitted for State acceptance trails, an order had been placed for fifty more aircraft on 26 February (these aircraft have been referred to as the MiG-13, which presumably would have been their designation if they had actually entered service). A new deadline of 5 July 1946 was set for the delivery of the first pre-production aircraft, but it was stymied, again, for a lack of an engine. By this time seven airframes had been completed, but all lacked engines. The first I-250 was finally accepted on 8 August and flown for the first time three days later, although its engine seals failed and a number of <b>ignition</b> <b>cables</b> were scorched. The engine replacement and repairs forced the aircraft to miss its scheduled appearance at the Tushino Air Display. It was handed over to the NII VVS (Air Force Institute) on 15 September to finally begin its State acceptance tests. All ten aircraft had been delivered by 30 October, although construction number 3810107 (Factory No. 381, first batch, seventh aircraft) was used as a static test airframe and 3810110 became a static engine testbed.|$|R
40|$|Copper and {{aluminum}} {{has been used}} as electrical conductor for power system transmission and distribution a long time ago. Due to higher demand of copper {{and aluminum}} in various sectors, copper and aluminum price has rose over a time and it has become a catalyst of cable theft activities. The utilities company throughout the world has lost billions of money due to cable theft activities. In this project, a carbon fiber based material known as polyester carbon coated is tested as replacement to copper and aluminum as electrical conductor. The conductor has been approved by SAE and used commercially as conductor in <b>ignition</b> <b>cable</b> for automotive sector. The main objective of this project is to study the characteristic and the current carrying capabilities of the polyester carbon coated as electrical conductor. A various type of test will be conducted on this conductor. Its include conductor resistance and resistivity, voltage drop by measurement and calculation and conductor current carrying capacity. The test that conducts meets British Standard requirement on power cable testing. The result of this project is a set of testing data which that will be analyzed in order to determine whether this conductor is suitable or not suitable to be used as conductor in power system and also a comparison of performance with existing materials...|$|R
40|$|The inlet mass flow, fuel {{injection}} profile, igniter characteristics, ignition delay, and operational frequency all dictate {{the success of}} a Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE). An optical sensor was developed and utilized for the observation of ignition zone characteristics over varying refresh conditions that showed decreasing ignition delay times when approaching marginally fuelrich reactant mixtures. A wide range of equivalence ratios for ethylene/air mixtures were explored and a limited number of JP- 10 /air mixtures. The JP- 10 /air fuel mixtures were nearly impossible to ignite at characteristic velocities greater than 35 m/s until a porous <b>ignition</b> <b>shield</b> was installed. The porous shield, surrounding the Transient Plasma Ignition (TPI) electrode, demonstrated the successful ignition at characteristic velocities up to 100 m/s for C 2 H 4 /air and 55 m/s for JP- 10 /air mixtures. The <b>ignition</b> <b>shield</b> slowed down a portion of the fuel-air mixture to increase the local residence time, allowing for more reliable ignition. The resulting combustion products proceeded to ignite the remaining fuel-air mixture. The <b>ignition</b> <b>shield</b> design appears to locally prevent a complete purge of the previous cycle's products, and a transient plasma discharge was still required for subsequent ignition to occur. This effect further reduced the observed ignition delay time in ethylene/air and JP- 10 /air fuel mixtures. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
40|$|Stand-alone {{off-grid}} {{power supply}} system is a necessity for applications when electrical power distribution network is inaccessible. Internal and external subject security aspects should be valued, and the system should be optimized to obtain properly working, never-failing and secure local electrical {{power supply system}}. Internal security aspects result from both security concept and used technologies. Internal threats contain fire <b>ignition,</b> flooding, electrical <b>cables</b> melting and other threats arising from intrinsic materials or subsystems characteristics, at standard conditions of use. Additional external aspects include anti-theft protection, breaking doors or windows signaling and countermeasure, weather extremes alert, etc. Both internal and external aspects necessarily induce additional off-grid power system or subject monitoring that might be performed by supervising security subsystem. This paper provides a solution for off-grid security subsystem. It consists from pervasive sensor circuits, fuzzy controlled diagnostics and executive actuators. Cooperated fuzzy logic diagnostic and control device enables to evaluate anticipated threats and dynamically generates the most appropriate decisions about real threat existence that leads to improvement of system protection. Proposed fuzzy rules are particularly discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a wide range of {{components}} in and near the target bay of the National Ignition Facility (NIF) must allow for significant radiation from neutrons and gammas. Detailed 3 D Monte Carlo simulations are critical to determine neutron and gamma fluxes for all target-bay components to allow optimization of location and auxiliary <b>shielding.</b> Demonstration of <b>ignition</b> poses unique challenges because of the large range ({approx} 3 orders of magnitude) in the yield for any given attempt at ignition. Some diagnostics will provide data independent of yield, while others will provide data for lower yields and only survive high yields with little or no damage. In addition, for a given yield there is a more than 10 orders of magnitude range in neutron and gamma fluxes depending on location in the facility. For example, sensitive components in the diagnostic mezzanines and switchyards require auxiliary shielding for high-yield shots even though they are greater than 17 meters from target chamber center (TCC) and shielded by the 2 m-thick target-bay wall. In contrast, there are components 0. 2 to 2 m from TCC with little or no shielding. For these components, particular attention is being made to use low-activation material because of the extremely high neutron loading levels. Many of the components closest to target center are designed to be single use to reduce worker dose from having to refurbish highly activated components. The cryogenic target positioner is an example where activation and ease of component replacement is an important part of the design. We are developing a design process for all target-bay systems that will assure reliable operation for the full range of planned yields...|$|R
2500|$|For 1968, {{both the}} Corvette body and {{interior}} were completely redesigned. As before, {{the car was}} available in either coupe or convertible models, but coupe was now a notchback fitted with a near-vertical removable rear window and removable roof panels (T-tops). A soft folding top was included with convertibles, while an auxiliary hardtop with a glass rear window was offered at additional cost. Included with coupes were hold down straps {{and a pair of}} vinyl bags to store the roof panels, and above the luggage area was a rear window stowage tray. The enduring new body's concealed headlights moved into position via a vacuum operated system rather than electrically as on the previous generation, and the new hide-away windshield wipers utilized a problematic vacuum door. The door handles were flush with the top of the doors with a separate release button. Front fenders had functional engine cooling vents. Side vent windows were eliminated from all models, replaced with [...] "Astro Ventilation", a fresh air circulation system. In the cabin, a large round speedometer and matching tachometer were positioned in front of the driver. Auxiliary gauges were clustered above the forward end of the console and included oil pressure, water temperature, ammeter, fuel gauge, and an analog clock. A fiber-optic system appeared on the console that monitored exterior lights and there was no glove box. The battery was relocated from the engine area to one of three compartments behind the seats to improve weight distribution. New options included a rear window defroster, anti-theft alarm system, bright metal wheel covers, and an AM-FM Stereo radio. All cars ordered with a radio, like the C2 cars, continued to be fitted with chrome-plated <b>ignition</b> <b>shielding</b> covering the distributor to reduce interference.|$|R
2500|$|... 1978 was the Corvette's twenty fifth anniversary, and all 78's {{featured}} silver anniversary {{nose and}} fuel door emblems. A new fastback rear window {{was the most}} dramatic and noticeable styling change, giving the ten-year-old C3 Corvette body style a fresh lease on life. The fixed-glass fastback benefited both aerodynamics and increased the usable luggage space behind the seats while improving rearward visibility in the bargain. A shade was installed that could be pulled forward to cover the rear compartment to protect cargo and carpet against the unrelenting sun. The tachometer and speedometer were redesigned to match the new “aircraft styled” center console and gauge cluster first seen the previous year. Redesigned interior door panels were also new {{as well as an}} actual glove box was added in front of the passenger seat, replacing the map pockets of previous years. Available options now included power door locks, a power antenna, dual rear speakers and a CB radio. The optional convenience group, introduced the previous year, now included intermittent (delay) wipers, floor mats, and the passenger side vanity mirror was an upgraded illuminated unit. The base L-48 engine generated Those destined for California or high altitude areas produced [...] Gone was the chrome-plated <b>ignition</b> <b>shielding</b> over the distributor, replaced with a metal-lined black plastic unit. The single-snorkel air intake used since 1976 was changed to a dual-snorkel set-up on L-82 equipped cars helping to boost that output to [...] L-82 engines were also now fitted with an aluminum intake manifold which saved 24pounds compared to the cast iron unit of previous years. The Corvette converted to metric tires with the P225/70R15 as standard. Wider P255/60R15 tires were available as an option and required fender trimming from the factory for clearance. The fuel tank capacity increased from 17 gal to 24 gal on all cars. To make room for the larger tank, a smaller (P195/80D15) space saver spare tire was utilized.|$|R
