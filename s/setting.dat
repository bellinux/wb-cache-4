5|$|Before {{receiving}} the French intelligence material, Rejewski {{had made a}} careful study of Enigma messages, particularly of the first six letters of messages intercepted on a single day. For security, each message was encrypted using different starting positions of the rotors, as selected by the operator. This message <b>setting</b> was three letters long. To convey it to the receiving operator, the sending operator began the message by sending the message <b>setting</b> in a disguised form — a six-letter indicator. The indicator was formed using the Enigma with its rotors set to a common global <b>setting</b> for that day, termed the ground <b>setting,</b> which was shared by all operators. The particular way that the indicator was constructed introduced a weakness into the cipher.|$|E
5|$|Development lasted three years, {{involving}} {{a team of}} thirteen people. Several members, including director Matt Nava and composer Austin Wintory, had previously worked on the 2012 video game Journey—the ocean <b>setting</b> of Abzû was both {{a reaction to the}} desert <b>setting</b> of Journey and inspired by Nava's love of scuba diving. The <b>setting</b> and story drew from Sumerian mythology and the cosmic ocean myth. Reaching high positions in sales charts, Abzû was praised by journalists: the majority of praise went to its art style, with some critics comparing it to Journey.|$|E

40|$|Anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> {{based on}} invex <b>set</b> and its related {{properties}} were researched, and anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> and some {{results in the}} related references were generalized. By applying thought of invex <b>set</b> to anti-convex fuzzy <b>set,</b> a new generalized anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> called anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based on invex <b>set</b> was proposed. Let A∈F(Rn), andA is called Anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based on invex <b>set,</b> whereη:Rn×Rn→Rn, and A(y+αη(x,y)) ≤A(x) ∨A(y),x,y∈Rn,α∈［ 0, 1 ］. Then, the relation between anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> and anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based on invex <b>set</b> was discussed. If η(x,y) =x－y, then anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based on invex <b>set</b> was degenerated into anti-convex fuzzy <b>set,</b> and obviously, anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> was made particular case of anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based on invex <b>set.</b> Anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based on invex <b>set</b> was not anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> by building an example, and anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based on invex <b>set</b> was a true generalization of anti-convex fuzzy <b>set.</b> Thirdly, based on the definition of anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based on invex <b>set,</b> the properties about the union and denseness of anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based on invex <b>set</b> and the condition for fuzzy <b>sets</b> to be anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based on invex <b>set</b> were studied. Lastly, similarly to ant-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based on invex <b>set,</b> the conditions for fuzzy <b>set</b> to be strongly anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based on invex <b>set</b> and strictly anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> based on invex <b>set</b> fuzzy <b>sets</b> were respectively studied...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{connections}} among the n-dimensional fuzzy <b>set,</b> Zadeh fuzzy <b>set</b> and the finite-valued fuzzy <b>set</b> are established in this paper. The n-dimensional fuzzy <b>set,</b> a special L-fuzzy <b>set,</b> is first defined. It is {{pointed out that}} the n-dimensional fuzzy <b>set</b> is a generalization of the Zadeh fuzzy <b>set,</b> the interval-valued fuzzy <b>set,</b> the intuitionistic fuzzy <b>set,</b> the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy <b>set</b> and the three dimensional fuzzy <b>set.</b> Then, the definitions of cut <b>set</b> on n-dimensional fuzzy <b>set</b> and n-dimensional vector level cut <b>set</b> of Zadeh fuzzy <b>set</b> are presented. The cut <b>set</b> of the n-dimensional fuzzy <b>set</b> and n-dimensional vector level <b>set</b> of the Zadeh fuzzy <b>set</b> are both defined as n+ 1 -valued fuzzy <b>sets.</b> It is shown that a cut <b>set</b> defined in this way has the same properties as a normal cut <b>set</b> of the Zadeh fuzzy <b>set.</b> Finally, by the use of these cut <b>sets,</b> decomposition and representation theorems of the n-dimensional fuzzy <b>set</b> and new decomposition and representation theorems of the Zadeh fuzzy <b>set</b> are constructed...|$|R
5|$|For example, {{suppose the}} {{operator}} chose the message <b>setting</b> KYG for a message. The operator would first set the Enigma's rotors {{to the ground}} <b>setting,</b> which might be GBL on that particular day, and then encrypt the message <b>setting</b> on the Enigma twice; that is, the operator would enter KYGKYG (which might come out to something like QZKBLX). The operator would then reposition the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message <b>setting,</b> then the message itself. The repetition of the message <b>setting</b> was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the message <b>setting,</b> Rejewski knew that, in the plaintext of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited {{to break into the}} cipher.|$|E
5|$|In early {{editions of}} the <b>setting,</b> The Realms shared a unified {{cosmology}} with various other campaign settings called the Great Wheel.

50|$|A second {{difficulty}} {{with the idea of}} a universal <b>set</b> concerns the power <b>set</b> of the <b>set</b> of all <b>sets.</b> Because this power <b>set</b> is a <b>set</b> of <b>sets,</b> it would automatically be a subset of the <b>set</b> of all <b>sets,</b> provided that both exist.
