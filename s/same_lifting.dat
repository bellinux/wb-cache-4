The mean values of the accuracy of simulating self and humanoid postures were 1220 and 1520, respectively.

NEP is also shown to be feasible for transporting people to Mars on long conjunction-class missions lasting about nine months one way, and on short sprint missions lasting four months one way. Generally, it was not attempted to optimize ion exhaust velocities, but rather suitable parameters to demonstrate NEP feasibility were chosen. Various combinations of missions are compared with chemical and nuclear thermal propulsion (NTR) systems. Typically, NEP and NTR can accomplish the <b>same</b> <b>lifting</b> task with similar mass in LEO.

In addition, a full rectangular tip which has the same span as the Ogee tip and an effective rectangular tip which has the <b>same</b> <b>lifting</b> area as the Ogee tip were also considered.

40|$|Let X and Y be proper bi{{rational}} varieties, {{say with}} only rational double points over a perfect field k of positive characteristic. If X lifts to W_n(k), {{is it true}} that Y has the <b>same</b> <b>lifting</b> property? This is true for smooth surfaces, but we show by example that this is false for smooth varieties in higher dimension, and for surfaces with canonical singularities. We also answer a stacky analogue of this question: given a canonical surface X with minimal resolution Y and stacky resolution X, we characterize when liftability of Y is equivalent to that of X. The main input for our results is a study of how the deformation functor of a canonical surface singularity compares with the deformation functor of its minimal resolution. This extends work of Burns and Wahl to positive characteristic. As a byproduct, we show that Tjurina's vanishing result fails for every canonical surface singularity in every positive characteristic.

40|$|AbstractWinkler (1988) and Pauer (1992) present {{algorithms}} for a Hensel {{lifting of}} a modular Gröbner basis over lucky primes to a rational one. They have {{to solve a}} linear system with modular polynomial entries that requires another (modular) Gröbner basis computation. After an extension of luckiness to arbitrary (commutative noetherian) base rings we show in this paper that for a homogeneous polynomial ideal I one can lift not only its Gröbner basis but also a homogeneous basis of its syzygy module. The same result holds for arbitrary ideals and liftings from Z /p to Q. Moreover the <b>same</b> <b>lifting</b> {{can be obtained from}} a true Gröbner trace by linear algebra over Q only. Parallel modular techniques allow to find such a true Gröbner trace and a lucky prime with high probability. All these results generalize in an obvious way to homogeneous modules generated by the rows of matrices with polynomial entries. Since luckiness can be weakened to a condition that transfers from I to higher syzygy modules the lifting theorem generalizes to a lifting theorem for the resolution of I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{considers}} the precedence constrained knapsack problem. More specifically, {{we are interested}} in classes of valid inequalities which are facet-defining for the precedence constrained knapsack polytope. We study the complexity of obtaining these facets using the standard sequential lifting procedure. Applying this procedure requires solving a combinatorial problem. For valid inequalities arising fromminimal induced covers, we identify a class of lifting coefficients for which this problem can be solved in polynomial time, by using a supermodular function, and for which the values of the lifting coefficients have a combinatorial interpretation. For the remaining lifting coefficients it is shown that this optimization problem is strongly NP-hard. The <b>same</b> <b>lifting</b> procedure can be applied to (1,k) -configurations, although in this case, the same combinatorial interpretation no longer applies. We also consider K-covers, to which the same procedure need not apply in general. We show that facets of the polytope can still be generated using a similar lifting technique. For tree knapsack problems, we observe that all lifting coefficients can be obtained in polynomial time. Computational experiments indicate that these facets significantly strengthen the LP-relaxation. 1...|$|E
40|$|Many {{behavioural}} equivalences or preorders for probabilistic processes {{involve a}} lifting operation that turns a relation on states into a relation on distributions of states. We show that several existing proposals for lifting relations can be reconciled {{to be different}} presentations of essentially the <b>same</b> <b>lifting</b> operation. More interestingly, this lifting operation nicely corresponds to the Kantorovich metric, a fundamental concept used in mathematics to lift a metric on states to a metric on distributions of states, besides the fact the lifting operation {{is related to the}} maximum flow problem in optimisation theory. The lifting operation yields a neat notion of probabilistic bisimulation, for which we provide logical, metric, and algorithmic characterisations. Specifically, we extend the Hennessy-Milner logic and the modal mu-calculus with a new modality, resulting in an adequate and an expressive logic for probabilistic bisimilarity, respectively. The correspondence of the lifting operation and the Kantorovich metric leads to a natural characterisation of bisimulations as pseudometrics which are post-fixed points of a monotone function. We also present an "on the fly" algorithm to check if two states in a finitary system are related by probabilistic bisimilarity, exploiting the close relationship between the lifting operation and the maximum flow problem.
