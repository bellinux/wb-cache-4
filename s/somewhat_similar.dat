5|$|In June 2005, ECMA {{approved}} edition 3 of the C# specification, {{and updated}} ECMA-334. Additions included partial classes, anonymous methods, nullable types, and generics (<b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> to C++ templates).|$|E
5|$|Marasmius subconiatus, {{known from}} Sri Lanka and Indonesia, is <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> to M.sasicola. It can be {{differentiated}} as its stem does {{not enter the}} substrate, and the gills differ. In M.subconiatus, the gills are orange, and sport cheilocystidia which are pale yellow.|$|E
5|$|Retiboletus retipes is <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> in appearance, but is {{distinguished}} {{by a more}} orange to orange-yellow color, a lack of sliminess, and a distinctly reticulated stalk.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of shumwayite is unique. <b>Somewhat</b> chemically <b>similar</b> natural uranyl sulfates include jáchymovite, metauranopilite and uranopilite.|$|R
50|$|Hermannjahnite is a zinc-analogue of dravertite - another mineral from {{prolific}} Tolbachik. Minerals <b>somewhat</b> chemically <b>similar</b> to hermannjahnite include ktenasite and christelite.|$|R
50|$|While {{the series}} is praised, some critics aimed {{to the fact that}} {{the series is}} <b>somewhat</b> too <b>similar</b> to Japan's Pretty Cure, or in other, copied from the Japanese counterpart.|$|R
5|$|The European species Mycena viridimarginata is <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> to M.intersecta in appearance, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} by its greenish-edged gills, cheilocystidia with abruptly tapering points, and clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The call {{consists}} of weak staccato, chirping whistles, kleek kik ik ik ik, <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> in cadence to a gull's call. The calls of young birds {{tend to be}} more harsh and shrill than those of adults.|$|E
5|$|These {{ideas were}} <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> to {{elements}} of the 1946 French film version of Beauty and the Beast, which introduced the character of Avenant, an oafish suitor <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> to Gaston, as well as inanimate objects coming {{to life in the}} Beast's castle. The animated objects were, however, given distinct personalities in the Disney version. By early 1990, Katzenberg had approved the revised script, and storyboarding began again. The production flew story artists back and forth between California and New York for storyboard approvals from Ashman, though the team was not told the reason why.|$|E
5000|$|... Sesquiquadrate 135°(orb ±2°). Indicates <b>somewhat</b> {{stressful}} conditions. <b>Similar</b> to semisextile.|$|R
5000|$|... Semisquare 45°(orb ±2°). Indicates <b>somewhat</b> {{difficult}} circumstance. <b>Similar</b> {{in effect}} to semisextile.|$|R
50|$|Combination of {{elements}} in abenakiite-(Ce) is unique. <b>Somewhat</b> chemically <b>similar</b> mineral is steenstrupine-(Ce). The hyper-sodium abenakiite-(Ce) is also unique in supposed presence {{of sulfur dioxide}} ligand. With a single grain (originally) found, abenakiite-(Ce) is extremely rare.|$|R
5|$|A case <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> to Batesian mimicry {{is that of}} mimetic weeds, which imitate {{agricultural}} crops. In weed or Vavilovian mimicry, {{the weed}} survives by having seeds which winnowing machinery identifies as belonging to the crop. Vavilovian mimicry is not Batesian, because man and crop are not enemies.|$|E
5|$|In {{collections}} {{which contain}} fossils, high humidity can also affect pyrite (or its more reactive polymorph marcasite) (iron sulphide) fossils in a <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> condition, {{which is known}} as pyrite disease. The iron sulfide can react with water and oxygen to form iron sulfates and sulfuric acid, which then can produce Bynesian decay.|$|E
5|$|The Aristotle project, a multi-year {{initiative}} by Google Inc. {{aimed at}} defining {{the characteristics of}} an ideal team in the workplace, has found <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> conditions for group effectiveness. They found that by far, most important factor is psychological safety. The other key factors in productivity are dependability, structure and clarity, personal meaning, and each team member feeling like they have an impact.|$|E
5000|$|The symbol [...] {{may also}} be used when the palatal approximant is merely an {{allophone}} of the voiced palatal fricative [...] as, compared with , it is <b>somewhat</b> more <b>similar</b> to the symbol [...] The X-SAMPA equivalent of [...] is j\_o.|$|R
50|$|Roggenbier - {{a fairly}} dark beer made with rye, <b>somewhat</b> grainy flavour <b>similar</b> to bread, 4.5-6% ABV.|$|R
50|$|Tischler {{designed}} several monuments in a <b>similar</b> <b>somewhat</b> rustic style reminiscent both {{of medieval}} fortresses {{and of the}} Hindenburg monument.|$|R
5|$|Thelephora anthocephala is <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> in appearance, {{but can be}} {{distinguished}} by branches that taper upward, branch tips that are flattened (instead of spoon-like), {{and the lack of}} a fetid odor. The North American species T.vialis has smaller spores and a more variable color. Darker Ramaria species are distinguished by their non-leathery flesh texture and pointy branch tips.|$|E
5|$|Among myriapods, millipedes have {{traditionally}} been considered most {{closely related to the}} tiny pauropods, although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. Millipedes can be distinguished from the <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> but only distantly related centipedes (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are carnivorous, and have only a single pair of legs on each body segment. The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.|$|E
5|$|Gom bian (also {{known as}} 光饼 or Kompia) — a Foochow {{delicacy}} made with flour, baked in an oven and eaten either {{with or without}} meat and gravy. It is <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> to a bagel. However, it can be either in a crisp or soft version. Traditional soft kompia dipped in pork sauce can be sought from Chung Hua road and the Sunday Market at Pedada road. There are deep fried variations available throughout the town of Sibu.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{results of}} trials, which favored the B-30, the Artillery Directorate decided {{to adopt the}} Br-2. The reasons for the {{decision}} are not clear. However, {{it was decided to}} switch to free tube barrel construction in production pieces, making the gun <b>somewhat</b> more <b>similar</b> to the B-30.|$|R
50|$|It was {{restored}} in 1962 {{according to the}} project of Petro Baranovskyi in <b>somewhat</b> changed style <b>similar</b> to Russian churches (in particular the dome).|$|R
50|$|Royal Walk is {{actually}} <b>somewhat</b> very <b>similar</b> to Purple & Gold day {{except for that}} your family members or neighbors pledge you, and pay, for how many laps you run, the money goes to the school, for playgrounds, etc. And the person in each grade with the most wins Wiis, stuffed animals, etc. All grades compete.|$|R
5|$|Guzmán {{considers}} Psilocybe tampanensis to be intermediate in form between P.mexicana and P.caerulescens. Psilocybe mexicana {{has a more}} Mycena-like {{fruit body}} shape, and longer basidia measuring 22–24 by 7.7–11μm. It is known only from Mexico and Guatemala. Psilocybe caerulescens, found in the USA and Venezuela, is also <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar,</b> but has a collybioid habit (small to medium-sized mushrooms with a convex cap), with spores measuring 6.7–8 by 5.2–6.5 by 3.3–5.2μm, and cheilocystidia that are 15–22 by 4.4–5.5μm.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{radio and}} {{particle}} emissions are strongly modulated by its rotation, {{which makes the}} planet <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> to a pulsar. This periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere, which are caused by the tilt of the magnetic moment {{with respect to the}} rotational axis as well as by high-latitude magnetic anomalies. The physics governing Jupiter's radio emissions {{is similar to that of}} radio pulsars. They differ only in the scale, and Jupiter can be considered a very small radio pulsar too. In addition, Jupiter's radio emissions strongly depend on solar wind pressure and, hence, on solar activity.|$|E
5|$|Morchella populiphila is a {{distinct}} morel because of its cap attachment and its habitat, and {{it is unlikely to}} be mistaken for other species. Verpa bohemica is <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> in appearance, but its cap hangs free from attachment to the stipe. The other North American half-free morel, Morchella punctipes, is very similar in appearance to M.populiphila, and they cannot be reliably distinguished on morphology alone. The distribution of M.punctipes extends from the Great Plains eastward. The widespread European species Morchella semilibera is morphologically indistinguishable from M.populiphila, in both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Similar,</b> <b>somewhat</b> paler on both {{upper and}} under sides; the discal and subterminal {{transverse}} fasciae more pronounced; the ocelli {{on the underside}} of the hindwing minute or absent.|$|R
500|$|Since {{the release}} of C# 2.0 in November 2005, the C# and Java {{languages}} have evolved on increasingly divergent trajectories, becoming <b>somewhat</b> less <b>similar.</b> One of the first major departures came {{with the addition of}} generics to both languages, with vastly different implementations. C# makes use of reification to provide [...] "first-class" [...] generic objects that can be used like any other class, with code generation performed at class-load time.|$|R
50|$|The lead {{character}} is somewhat younger {{than in the}} novel. Traveling alone in the book, she is accompanied by her aunt in the film. The film is <b>somewhat</b> dark, <b>similar</b> to other Disney live-action features made in the 1950s and 1960s for more mainstream audiences such as 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Treasure Island. It was Walt Disney's penultimate live-action film {{in which he was}} credited as producer while alive.|$|R
5|$|Mycena arcangeliana is <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> to {{the less}} common Mycena flavescens, a species found in both {{hardwood}} and softwood forests on the floor among leaf or needle litter or grassland. M. flavescens typically has a whiter cap and a smell reminiscent of radish. M. peyerimhoffi, known from Algeria, has a similar cap colour to M. arcangeliana, but has a yellow stem. M. limonia, known from the Netherlands, has a lemon-yellow cap and stem and more gills. Another species similar in appearance is M. metata, which has a sweet taste.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{congener}} Sutorius australiensis produces somewhat {{smaller and}} darker fruitbodies than S.eximius. The violet-grey bolete, Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus, {{is found in}} eastern North America and Korea. This species is <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> in appearance, but can be distinguished by its smoother stipe, less brownish colors, and bitter taste. The Asian and North American black velvet bolete,T.alboater, has a black to grayish-brown cap and grows in deciduous woods. T.violatinctus, found in eastern North America, has whitish pores, a smooth stipe, and a somewhat paler cap than S.eximius.|$|E
5|$|The Polonnaruwa Vatadage {{is located}} in a quadrangular area known as the Dalada Maluva in the ancient city of Polonnaruwa. The Dalada Maluva {{contains}} some of the oldest and most sacred monuments of the city. The Polonnaruwa Vatadage, which occupies most of the south western area of it, is a prominent structure among them. It is the best preserved example of a Vatadage in the country, and is <b>somewhat</b> <b>similar</b> in design to those belonging to the Anuradhapura period, especially Thuparamaya and Lankaramaya.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 11 mm. The forewings are dark blackish brown with a bright, bluish metallic sheen {{and with a}} round, silvery white dot on the cell and an oblong, silvery white dash {{at the end of}} the cell. The hindwings are blackish brown with a large silvery white spot on the middle of costa and a <b>somewhat</b> smaller <b>similar</b> spot just below it on the dorsal edge.|$|R
40|$|Graded {{interference}} effects {{were tested in}} a naming task, in parallel for objects and actions. Participants named either object or action pictures presented {{in the context of}} other pictures (blocks) that were either semantically very <b>similar,</b> or <b>somewhat</b> semantically <b>similar</b> or semantically dissim-ilar. We found that naming latencies for both object and action words were modulated by the semantic similarity between the exemplars in each block, providing evidence in both domains o...|$|R
5000|$|Café con leche ("coffee with milk") is a Spanish white coffee {{beverage}}. It is <b>somewhat</b> more <b>similar</b> to the Italian caffè latte (latte) {{than to the}} French café au lait for a latte is {{made with}} espresso rather than drip coffee. Café con leche is a coffee beverage consisting of strong or bold coffee (usually espresso) mixed with scalded milk in approximately a 1:1 ratio. Sugar or sweetener is added according to taste.|$|R
