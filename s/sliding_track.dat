60|$|The late {{afternoon}} found him feeding sheaves of wheat {{to one of}} the steam-threshers. He stood high upon a platform and pitched sheaves from the wagons upon the <b>sliding</b> <b>track</b> of the ponderous, rattling threshing-machine. The engine stood off fifty yards or more, connected by an endless driving-belt to the thresher. Here indeed were whistle and roar and whir, and the shout of laborers, and the smell of smoke, sweat, dust, and wheat. Kurt had arms of steel. If they tired he never knew it. He toiled, and he watched the long spout of chaff and straw as it streamed from the thresher to lift, magically, a glistening, ever-growing stack. And he felt, as a last and cumulative change, his physical effort, and the physical adjuncts of the scene, pass into something spiritual, into his heart and his memory.|$|E

The school is located steps from the Olympic Center which is a massive sports facility which houses 3 Hockey rinks and was home to the 1932 and 1980 Olympic Hockey competitions where the United States famously won the Gold medal (1980). The Olympic Center is the home practice and game facility {{for all of the}} National Sports Academy hockey players and speed skating athletes. The varsity A boys and girls teams practice daily and host all home games on the Herb Brooks Arena which is a 13,450 seat arena with a full Olympic sized sheet of ice. Players use the weight rooms, basketball courts and other amenities in the Olympic Center to help train them off ice. Outside is the Olympic Speed skating oval which has hosted many international competitions, most notably the 1932 and 1980 Olympic games. Alpine skiers are fortunate enough to have one of the best locations in the US for the advancement of their skills. Skiers train at the Olympic Training Center which hosts winter sport athletes from the US and other countries who are living in Lake Placid or in town to train for extended periods of time. This gives NSA student athletes a first hand opportunity to train with and observe the training practices of some of the top athletes in their respective sports.

40|$|As the {{clinical}} application grows, {{there is a}} rapid technical development of 3 -D ultrasound imaging. Compared with 2 -D ultrasound imaging, 3 -D ultrasound imaging can provide improved qualitative and quantitative information for various clinical applications. In this paper, we proposed a novel tracking method for a freehand 3 -D ultrasound imaging system with improved portability, reduced degree of freedom, and cost. We designed a <b>sliding</b> <b>track</b> with a linear position sensor attached, and it transmitted positional data via a wireless communication module based on Bluetooth, resulting in a wireless spatial tracking modality. A traditional 2 -D ultrasound probe fixed to the position sensor on the <b>sliding</b> <b>track</b> was used to obtain real-time B-scans, and {{the positions of the}} B-scans were simultaneously acquired when moving the probe along the track in a freehand manner. In the experiments, the proposed method was applied to ultrasound phantoms and real human tissues.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether there are significant differences in timing of start elements that lugers perform on a <b>sliding</b> <b>track</b> and an iced start ramp built for training purposes. Male and female lugers with different competitive experience performed starts on the start ramp and on the luge track. Timing of start elements was measured from high-speed video records and compared between start facilities. Most of the athletes showed different timing of start phases at the track and the ramp. These differences partially arise from a necessity to assume a riding position in-time on the track. Though training on the start ramp does not represent exactly start performance on a luge track, it is a convenient way for practicing technical elements of the start...|$|E

40|$|The role {{of water}} on the sub-surface {{degradation}} of unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composite is examined. The correlation between the debonding of carbon fibers at the fiber–epoxy interface, and the wear behavior of the carbon fiber composite are discussed based on an in-depth analysis of the worn surfaces. We demonstrate that a reciprocating sliding performed along an anti-parallel direction to the fiber orientation under dry conditions results in a large degradation by debonding and breaking of the carbon fibers compared to sliding in parallel and perpendicular directions. Immersion in water has a harmful effect on the wear resistance of the carbon fiber composite.

Experiments were conducted in a vacuum of one million Pa and {{in an environment of}} fifty thousandth Pa of chlorine gas at 25 C. The load was 500 grams and the sliding velocity was 0. 5 centimeter per second. The deformed surface layer which accumulates and develops successively is left behind the rider, and step shaped proturbances are developed even after single pass sliding under both environmental conditions.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{the wear}} {{characteristics}} of five different dental composite resins cured by conventional halogen light and LED light sources were investigated. Five different dental composite resins of Surefil, Z 100, Dyract AP, Fuji II LC and Compoglass were worn against a zirconia ceramic ball using a pin-on-disk type wear tester with 15 N contact force in a reciprocal sliding motion of sliding distance of 10 mm/cycle at 1 Hz under the room temperature dry condition. The wear variations of dental composite resins were linearly increased {{as the number}} of cycles increased. It was observed that the wear resistances of these specimens were in the order of Dyract AP> Surefil> Compoglass> Z 100 > Fuji LC. On the morphological observations by SEM, the large crack formation on the <b>sliding</b> <b>track</b> of Fuji LC specimen was the greatest among all resin composites. Dyract AP showed less wear with few surface damage. There is no significant difference in wear performance between conventional halogen light curing and light emitting diodes curing sources.
