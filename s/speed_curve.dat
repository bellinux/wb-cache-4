40|$|The high <b>curve</b> <b>speed</b> railway {{vehicles}} of the Japanese National Railways, {{the so called}} pendulum swing trains, have been running since 1973 {{with the aim of}} increasing speed on ordinary routes with a lot of curve track sections. The structure of high <b>curve</b> <b>speed</b> railway vehicles is designed to set up rollers between the body and the bogie, so as to be capable of running at higher <b>speed</b> at the <b>curve</b> sections, compared with that of older-type trains, by inclining the body when centrifugal force occurs. Although the aim of increased speed has been attained, it has been pointed out that the swing of the high <b>curve</b> <b>speed</b> railway vehicles is stronger than that of older-type trains. In this study, the author examined the motion sickness induced by the swing of these railway vehicles among both passengers and conductors with a selfadministrated questionnaire. The results are summarized as follows: 1) A higher percentage of passengers complaining of motion sickness and riding discomfort was observed in the high <b>curve</b> <b>speed</b> railway vehicles than in the control trains. The passengers pointed out the swing of the high <b>curve</b> <b>speed</b> vehicles most frequently as the reason for riding discomfort. 2) Conductors working on high <b>curve</b> <b>speed</b> railway vehicles complained of motion sickness symptoms at significantly higher rates on both outward and inward way than in the control trains. 3) Although more preventive measures against motion sickness were taken by conductors on high <b>curve</b> <b>speed</b> vehicles, they still suffered more from motion sickness and experienced more difficulties {{in the course of their}} work than those on the control trains. 4) It was considered that the difference between the rates of conductors and passengers complaining of motion sickness were due to the difference in responses to the riding on the train between the two groups. 5) Working on high <b>curve</b> <b>speed</b> railway vehicles brought conductors not only motion sickness but also subjective feeling of fatigue as well. Judging from these results, the high rate of subjective complaints of passengers and couductors riding on high <b>curve</b> <b>speed</b> railway vehicles resulted from the difference between the structure of these vehicles and that of older-type trains...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{accidents}} are commonly found on horizontal curves. It is therefore important {{to study how}} the curve geometry affects the driver behaviour. This paper focuses on analysis of speed and maximal lateral acceleration in seven curves on two-lane rural highways in Sweden. The curve geometry factors studied are radii, presence and length of spiral transitions, tangent lengths and radius of previous curve. Of the studied factors, radii and spiral transitions were found to influence the driver behaviour most. Both larger radii and longer spiral transitions result in higher <b>speeds</b> in <b>curves,</b> and <b>speed</b> variations within <b>curves</b> seemed to be independent on choice of <b>speed</b> entering the <b>curve...</b>|$|R
50|$|Minor {{improvements}} in the 1960s led to the Indusi I 60 system. When a 1000 Hz inductor was encountered, the driver had to acknowledge the caution signal within four seconds. Additionally, a countdown was started to check whether the train had slowed to a specified speed within a specified time frame. Depending {{on the type of}} train the locomotive was hauling, the system could be manually switched between three modes of operation: freight train, low speed and high speed passenger train. In each mode, the system calculated a different <b>speed</b> <b>curve</b> based on the maximum allowable speed and braking characteristics of the train.|$|E

50|$|Kites come {{in sizes}} ranging from 0.7 square meters to 21 square meters, or even larger. In general, {{the larger the}} surface area, the more power the kite has. Kite power is also {{directly}} linked to speed, and smaller kites can be flown faster in stronger winds. The kite size—wind <b>speed</b> <b>curve</b> tapers off, so going to a larger kite to reach lower wind ranges becomes futile at a wind speed of around eight knots.
