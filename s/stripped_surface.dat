40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of isosurfaces from scalar volume data has positioned {{itself as a}} fundamental visualization technique in many different applications. But the dramatically increasing size of volumetric data sets often prohibits the handling of these models on affordable low-end single processor architectures. Distributed clientserver systems integrating high-bandwidth transmission channels and Web-based visualization tools are one alternative to attack this particular problem, but therefore new approaches to reduce the load of numerical processing {{and the number of}} generated primitives are required. In this paper we outline different scenarios for distributed isosurface reconstruction from large-scale volumetric data sets.

40|$|The North Atlantic Ocean is {{considered}} a nitrogen (N) limited system once vernal stabilisation of the water column alleviates light limitation and allows phytoplankton growth to deplete surface nutrients to virtually undetectable levels. Ammonium and other regenerated N forms are then the main surface N source for phytoplankton production. The effort to determine which phytoplankton groups contribute to long-term biological export production would be greatly aided by information on which phytoplankton groups {{are responsible for the}} assimilation of nitrate, as opposed to those assimilating predominantly regenerated N. In this study, we used the natural abundance N isotopes to examine basin-scale patterns of nitrate and regenerated N assimilation and evaluated the relationships between these trends and phytoplankton community composition. Samples were collected during a summertime cruise transect (August–September 2013) from the subtropical (36 °N 73 °W) to the subarctic (54 °N 20 °W) North Atlantic and analysed for the N isotopic composition (δ 15 N vs. N 2 in air) of particulate nitrogen (PN) and nitrate, size-fractionated chlorophyll a, and phytoplankton group biomass using flow cytometry. The depth of the 300 nmol l− 1 nitrate isopleth shoaled from the subtropics (79 m), where phytoplankton <b>stripped</b> <b>surface</b> waters of nitrate, to the subarctic, where it intersected with the surface and the upward nutrient supply drove a summer phytoplankton bloom. The δ 15 N of PN above the nitracline increased from the subtropics (− 0. 3 ‰) to the subarctic (4. 2 ‰), reflecting both a change in the δ 15 N of the subsurface nitrate source (from 2. 4 ‰ to 5. 1 ‰) and increased reliance by phytoplankton on nitrate relative to regenerated N.

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1961. Bibliography: leaves [82]- 87. vii, 87 leaves mounted ill., fold. map, diagrs., tablesInterest in bauxitic soils has {{increased}} {{in recent years in}} Hawaii since Sherman (1953) pointed out that some Hawaiian soils could be considered ferruginous bauxites. Research in bauxitic soils was stimulated with the appropriation of funds by the 1957 Territorial Legislature for research in problems in reclaiming land used for mining. A study of vegetation of bauxitic soils was included in this research. Moomaw et al. (1959) studied the aluminum concentrations of plants growing on bauxitic soils of Hawaii. Of 23 plant species sampled, 13 were aluminum accumulators (> 1000 parts per million in dry plant material). Ecologic and floristic studies of bauxitic soils of Kauai were conducted by Moomaw and Takahashi (1960). who concluded most species present showed no definite affinity for soils of high aluminum content but rather were those plants adapted to warm and moist environments, acid and infertile soils, and to a shallow root zone. An important factor in present distribution of these species was the original site of introduction. Revegetation of stripmined bauxite soils of Kauai was studied by Younge and Moomaw (1961) who conducted fertility and vegetation experiments on the <b>stripped</b> <b>surface</b> and on topsoil returned to the <b>stripped</b> <b>surface</b> after mining. Forage on stripsoil was slow to establish {{but by the end of}} the first year the stripsoil outyielded the topsoil. Other' major studies of plants on aluminous soils have been conducted by Webb (1954) in Australia and New Guinea, and by Howard and Proctor (1957) in Jamaica. Webb analyzed 1324 plant species and found 80 accumulator species. Obligate accumulators were restricted to leached acid soils in areas of comparatively high rainfall. Howard and Proctor (1957) concluded that Jamaican bauxite soils contained no characteristic plant species and few accumulator species. No species were found on adjacent soils which would not grow on the bauxitic soils. Few quantitative comparisons of soil aluminum and plant aluminum concentrations have beep made. Usually plants sampled from areas thought to be high in aluminum have been analyzed for aluminum with no attempt to measure soil aluminum. Although shallow root systems are reported in bauxitic soils (Moomaw and Takahashi, 1960), no detailed studies of root development and distribution in these soils have been conducted. An interesting plant in the bauxitic soils of Kauai is Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Ait.) Hassk., a shrub introduced on Kauai about 50 years ago which now infests thousands of acres of land on that island. R. tomentosa poses a real threat to pasture and virgin areas on and around K 110 hana Crater, the original site of introduction, where it forms dense impenetrable thickets. Closely associated with R. tomentosa is Melastoma malabathricum L., another shrub introduced on Kilohana Crater which is also a frequently reported aluminum accumulator. Moomaw et ale (1959) reported 110 ppm aluminum in leaves of R. tomentosa and 10300 ppm aluminum in leaves of M. malabathricum from the Wailua Game Refuge area on Kauai. A detailed study of some plant relationships of bauxitic soils of Kauai was undertaken using R. tomentosa as the main test plant. M. malabathricum, Leucaena glauca (L.) Benth. and Araucaria excelsa (Lamb.) R. Br. were also used in some of the studies. The objectives of the study were: 1. To compare plant growth in soils of varying aluminum content. 2. To measure extractable aluminum from soils and to relate it to aluminum concentration in plant tissues. 3. To study the distribution of R. tomentosa and M. malabathricum on different soil series. 4.

In this study, the convective heat transfer process of the top and bottom <b>strip</b> <b>surface</b> due to single group slot nozzles in the ultra-fast cooling (UFC) system was studied by the fluid-structure interaction finite element method.

The cast strip also experiences more plastic deformation and consequently, the normal stress on the <b>strip</b> <b>surface</b> and effective strain at the strip center-line increase. Moreover, higher separating forces were predicted for longer set-back distances.

40|$|International audienceRoll {{life is a}} {{major issue}} in cold strip rolling. Roll wear may result either in too low roll roughness, {{bringing}} friction below the minimum requested for strip entrainment; or it may degrade <b>strip</b> <b>surface</b> quality. On the contrary, adhesive wear and transfer ("roll coating", "pick up") may form a thick metallic deposits on the roll which increases friction excessively and degrades <b>strip</b> <b>surface</b> again [1]. The roll surface, {{with the help of a}} materials-adapted lubricant, must therefore possess anti-wear and anti-adhesive properties. Thus, High Speed Steeel (HSS) rolls show superior properties compared with standard Cr-steel rolls due to their high carbide surface coverage. Another way to improve wear and adhesion properties of surfaces is to apply hard metallic (hard-Cr) or ceramic coatings. Chromium is renowned for its excellent anti-wear and anti-adhesive properties and may serve as a reference. Here, as a first step towards alternative, optimised coatings, a PVD TiN coating has been deposited on tool steels, as previous attempts have proved TiN to be rather successful in cold rolling experiments [2, 3]. Different tribological tests are reported here, giving insight in both anti-adhesive properties and fatigue life improvement...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of {{skin pass rolling}} on tensile and microstructural properties of three industrial grade steels was investigated. Skin pass rolling was performed on a laboratory mill equipped with a device designed to reproduce the effects of sheet tension and with load cells aimed at measuring the main working parameters. Analysis on tensile properties of skin pass rolled samples showed for an ultralow C grade and a low C grade a decreasing trend of the yield strength down to a minimum, followed by progressive rising values with increasing rolling elongation. This trend was related to changes of the tensile curve shape, leading to a transition from discontinuous to continuous yielding. A zinc-coated mild steel grade featured a tensile curve with a knee at transition from elastic to plastic regime. Accordingly, the change in yield strength with increasing skin pass elongation followed a linear trend. Microstructural and crystallographic information supplied by EBSD analyses suggested that the plastic strain induced by skin pass rolling originated a fairly homogeneous deformation field even on grains directly exposed on the <b>strip</b> <b>surface.</b> Micro-hardness profiles taken across strip thickness highlighted both increasing peak hardness values at <b>strip</b> <b>surfaces</b> and rising values at mid-thickness...|$|R
