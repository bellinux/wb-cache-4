The rapid cooling may be desired to refine the grain structure or determine the freezing sequence of the molten metal which is poured into the mould.

5000|$|The K-Series was {{introduced}} in 1988 by Rover Group as a powerplant for the Rover 200 car. It was the second volume-production implementation of the low-pressure sand-casting (or LPS) technique in a new plant sited between East Works and Cofton Hackett. (The first volume application of the LPS process had been for the M-16 cylinder head, produced in South Works, adjacent to the former forge). The LPS process pumped liquid aluminium into a chemically-bonded <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> from below. This reduced oxide inclusions and gave a casting yield of around 90%, compared with 60% for more conventional gravity casting processes. The process avoided many of the inherent problems of casting aluminium components and consequently permitted lower casting wall thickness and higher strength-to-weight ratios. However, the process required the use of heat-treated LM25 material which gave the engines {{a reputation for being}} fragile. An engine overheat would often result in the material becoming annealed and rendering the components scrap. The aluminium engine blocks were fitted with spun-cast iron cylinder liners that were initially manufactured by GKN's Sheepbridge Stokes of Chesterfield, but these were replaced by liners made by Goetze after some seminal research conducted by Charles Bernstein at Longbridge, which proved influential even to Ducati for their race engines.

50|$|Typically, {{the ends}} of the rails are cleaned, aligned flat and true, and spaced apart 25 mm. This gap between rail ends for welding is to ensure {{consistent}} results in the pouring of the molten steel into the weld mold. In the event of a welding failure, the rail ends can be cropped to a 75 mm gap, removing the melted and damaged rail ends, and a new weld attempted with a special mould and larger thermite charge. A two or three piece hardened <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> is clamped around the rail ends, and a torch of suitable heat capacity is used to preheat {{the ends of}} the rail and the interior of the mould. The proper amount of thermite with alloying metal is placed in a refractory crucible, and when the rails have reached a sufficient temperature, the thermite is ignited and allowed to react to completion (allowing time for any alloying metal to fully melt and mix, yielding the desired molten steel or alloy). The reaction crucible is then tapped at the bottom. Modern crucibles have a self-tapping thimble in the pouring nozzle. The molten steel flows into the mould, fusing with the rail ends and forming the weld. The slag, being lighter than the steel flows last from the crucible and overflows the mould into a steel catch basin, to be disposed of after cooling. The entire setup is allowed to cool. The mould is removed and the weld is cleaned by hot chiselling and grinding to produce a smooth joint. Typical time from start of the work until a train can run over the rail is approximately 45 minutes to more than an hour, depending on the rail size and ambient temperature. In any case, the rail steel must be cooled to less than 370 C before it can sustain the weight of rail locomotives.|$|E
5000|$|When a {{thermite}} {{process is}} used for track circuits - the bonding of wires to the rails with a copper alloy, a graphite mould is used. The graphite mould is reusable many times, because the copper alloy is not as hot as the steel alloys used in rail welding. In signal bonding, the volume of molten copper is quite small, approximately [...] and the mould is lightly clamped {{to the side of}} the rail, also holding a signal wire in place. In rail welding, the weld charge can weigh up to 13 kg. The hardened <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> is heavy and bulky, must be securely clamped in a very specific position and then subjected to intense heat for several minutes before firing the charge.When rail is welded into long strings, the longitudinal expansion and contraction of steel must be taken into account. British practice sometimes uses a sliding joint of some sort at the end of long runs of continuously welded rail, to allow some movement, although by using a heavy concrete sleeper and an extra amount of ballast at the sleeper ends, the track, which will be prestressed according to the ambient temperature at the time of its installation, will develop compressive stress in hot ambient temperature, or tensile stress in cold ambient temperature, its strong attachment to the heavy sleepers preventing buckling or other deformation. Current practice is to use welded rails throughout on high speed lines, and expansion joints are kept to a minimum, often only to protect junctions and crossings from excessive stress. American practice appears to be very similar, a straightforward physical restraint of the rail. The rail is prestressed, or considered [...] "stress neutral" [...] at some particular ambient temperature. This [...] "neutral" [...] temperature will vary according to local climate conditions, taking into account lowest winter and warmest summer temperatures. The rail is physically secured to the ties or sleepers with rail anchors, or anti-creepers. If the track ballast is good and clean and the ties are in good condition, and the track geometry is good, then the welded rail will withstand ambient temperature swings normal to the region.|$|E

30|$|According to the {{constitutive}} equation of <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> shear zone (Eq. (23)), for the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> with uniform grain size, {{there are two}} aspects {{of the influence of}} particle size on cutting force. One is the static strength of <b>sand</b> <b>mould,</b> the other are the linear and quadric terms of shear rate which are the momentum and kinetic energy of the moving sand respectively. In general, the static strength of <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> increases with the increase of the diameter of sand, and the momentum and kinetic energy of the single sand also increase with the diameter of sand particles. So the cutting force of the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> increases with the diameter increasing. However, the sand granularity in the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> is of 70 / 140, which means that the size of sand distributes randomly within a certain range. Therefore, the distributions of the sand particles and strength are non-uniform. In the <b>sand</b> <b>mould</b> cutting process, when cutting the large sand particle or the region with higher strength, the cutting forces will increase. Otherwise, cutting forces will decrease. In the {{constitutive equation}}s of prediction model (Eq. (23)), the compression strength σs is calculated as the macroscopical experimental results of the <b>sand</b> <b>mould,</b> and the sand particle diameter is calculated as an average diameter.
