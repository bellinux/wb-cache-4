5|$|For whole numbers {{less than}} a {{thousand}} million (< 109) the two scales are identical. From a thousand million up (≥ 109) the two scales diverge, using the <b>same</b> <b>words</b> for different numbers; this can cause misunderstanding.|$|E
5|$|The {{long and}} short scales are two of several large-number naming systems for integer powers of ten that use the <b>same</b> <b>words</b> with {{different}} meanings. The long scale is based on powers of one million, whereas the short scale is based on powers of one thousand.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the <b>same</b> <b>words</b> Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
50|$|The Figures of Diction include: Epanaphora, {{when the}} <b>same</b> <b>word</b> starts {{successive}} sentences, antistrophe, when the <b>same</b> <b>word</b> ends successive sentences, interlacement, when {{the previous two}} occur simultaneously, transplacement, when the <b>same</b> <b>word</b> is reused frequently. The repetition of the <b>same</b> <b>word</b> in these four figures produces an elegant and pleasant sound for the listener, rather than simply being repetitive.|$|R

25|$|Some of Canis's chansons use a cantus-firmus technique, {{in which}} Canis takes a line {{or two of}} music from a {{pre-existing}} chanson, including examples by Janequin, Claudin de Sermisy, and Gombert, and reworks it in a contrapuntal texture {{much different from the}} original, but using the <b>same</b> <b>words.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Yalḳ. i, § 736 {{is found}} a {{citation}} {{relating to the}} same verse, which cannot be traced to any other midrash, and is doubtless taken from Midrash Esfah. To this midrash may possibly be referred a passage in the Halakot Gedolot (ed. Warsaw, p.282b) and a fragment on Num. xvii. 14, xx. 1-3, in Wertheimer, Batte Midrashot, iii. 8-10, which agrees in its concluding words with the excerpt in Yalḳ., Num. 763 on Num. xx. 3 (found also ib. 262, on Ex. xvii. 2, which begins with the <b>same</b> <b>words).</b> The name of the midrash shows {{that it must have}} begun with Num. xi. 16. The other excerpts in the Yalḳuṭ from the Midrash Esfah, §§ 737, 739, 742, 764, 773, and 845, are based on Num. xi. 24, xii. 3-7, xii. 12, xxi. 9, xxvi. 2 (found also ib. 684, on Num. i. 2, which begins with the <b>same</b> <b>words),</b> and Deut. vi. 16; the extent of the midrash, however, can not be determined.|$|E
25|$|This two-source hypothesis, {{speculates that}} Matthew {{borrowed}} from both Mark and a hypothetical sayings collection, called Q. For most scholars, the Q collection accounts for what Matthew and Luke share — sometimes {{in exactly the}} <b>same</b> <b>words</b> — but are not found in Mark. Examples of such material are the Devil's three temptations of Jesus, the Beatitudes, the Lord's Prayer and many individual sayings.|$|E

25|$|Gherardello's secular {{music has}} survived in greater abundance. Ten madrigals, all for two voices; five ballatas, {{all for a}} single voice; and a very famous caccia, Tosto che l'alba, which is for three voices, survive. Stylistically his music {{is typical of the}} early Trecento, with the voices usually singing the <b>same</b> <b>words</b> at the same time, except for the caccia, in which the upper two voices sing a quickly moving canon, and the lowest voice sings a freely {{composed}} part in longer notes.|$|E
25|$|The table below {{presents}} {{a sample of}} Unami words, written first in a linguistically oriented transcription, followed by the <b>same</b> <b>words</b> written in a practical system. The linguistic system uses the acute accent to indicate predictable stress and a raised dot (·) to indicate vowel and consonant length. The practical system interprets the contrast between long and corresponding short vowels as one of quality, using acute and grave accents to indicate vowel quality. Stress, which as noted is predictable, and consonant length are not indicated in the practical system.|$|E
