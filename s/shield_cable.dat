40|$|Abstract- Coaxial pulse {{generators}} are well-suited devices for high voltage pulse generation {{in the range}} of nanoseconds or microseconds. Basically these devices consist of pieces of transmission lines charged in parallel and discharged synchronously in series into the load by using a single switch. The main problems with this type of generator are the presence of the <b>shield</b> <b>cable</b> impedance that contributes to the power loss of the device and the requirement of long lengths of lines for operation in the microsecond range. In view of that, this paper presents a construction method that minimizes these losses and reduces the generator size by coiling coaxial lines around cylindrical PVC tubes. In particular, we report the PSPICE circuit simulation of the input and output pulse voltages including the <b>shield</b> <b>cable</b> impedance, which is estimated from the inductance and the capacitance (with respect to ground) of the coaxial winding...|$|E
40|$|The {{ejection}} of appendages with uncertain drag characteristics {{presents a}} concern for eventual recontact. Recontact shortly after release can be prevented by avoiding ejection in a plane perpendicular to the velocity. For ejection tangential to the orbit, the likelihood of recontact within a year is high {{in the absence of}} drag and oblateness. The optimum direction of ejection of the thermal <b>shield</b> <b>cable</b> and an overestimate of the recontact probability are determined for the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) mission when drag, oblateness, and solar/lunar perturbations are present.

40|$|A {{process for}} making RF <b>shielded</b> <b>cable</b> {{connector}} assemblies {{and the resulting}} structures is described. The process basically consists of potting wires of a <b>shielded</b> <b>cable</b> between the <b>cable</b> <b>shield</b> and a connector housing to fill in, support, regidize, and insulate the individual wires contained in the cable.

40|$|Usage-based pricing has rapidly {{become one}} of the most {{controversial}} topics in Internet policy. Both wired and wireless broadband providers are migrating from flat-rate pricing to a variety of consumption-based pricing models. Some consumer groups have viewed the change to usage-based pricing with skepticism, fearing it will usher in an era of higher prices, deteriorating service, and increasingly anticompetitive conduct. This article evaluates the merits of data caps, tiered-service plans, and other usage-based pricing strategies. It finds that usage-based broadband pricing is not inherently anti-consumer or anti-competitive. Rather, it reflects a cluster of pricing strategies through which a broadband company might recover its costs and fund future investment. Under a flat-rate plan, lighter users cross-subsidize heavier users. By aligning costs with broadband use, usage-based pricing shifts more network costs onto those who use the network the most. Critics claim that usage-based pricing is unfair, because the marginal costs of data transport are low, and therefore heavier users do not cost more than lighters. But this argument ignores the significant fixed costs of building and maintaining a network. The central challenge for broadband pricing is allocating those fixed costs across the customer base. Unlimited flat-rate pricing is one strategy, but not necessarily the most efficient. Usage-based pricing is a form of price discrimination that allows broadband providers to recover more of their fixed costs from customers with relatively inelastic demand. This strategy more closely approximates Ramsey pricing and therefore may be a more efficient way of recovering fixed costs without distorting consumer preferences. Pricing experimentation may also help narrow the digital divide. By recovering more fixed costs from heavier users, firms may have more freedom to extend service at a lower rate to light users who are unable or unwilling to pay the unlimited flat rate. There is evidence that these opportunities are beginning to emerge from companies engaged in usage-based pricing. Usage-based pricing may also help alleviate network congestion, though the case is less clear. Unlimited flat-rate pricing encourages overconsumption of network resources, which can create congestion during peak periods. Usage-based pricing encourages consumers to use less bandwidth and to demand more bandwidth-efficient practices by Internet content and service providers. But it is not clear that current pricing strategies will help mitigate peak-time congestion. To use pricing to shift consumption to off-peak periods, companies would need to show peak times are predictable. Fixed networks show regular peak times, but congestion is not currently a significant problem for fixed providers. On the wireless side, congestion is problematic but peak times are less predictable. With current technology, usage-based pricing may reduce aggregate demand and help chronically over-congested networks, but firms likely cannot yet use differentiated pricing to reduce peak-time congestion levels. Unquestionably, some vertically-integrated broadband providers may use usage-based pricing anticompetitively to <b>shield</b> <b>cable</b> affiliates from Internet-based video competition. While these risks exist, the literature suggests that vertical restraints on trade can be pro-competitive or anticompetitive. Regulators should remain vigilant with regard to potentially anticompetitive conduct, but should intervene only when a firm exploits market power in a way that causes actual consumer harm. Regulators should also assure that broadband providers have transparent pricing practices and give consumers tools to estimate monthly data use. Only through experimentation and empirical measurement will providers find the optimal pricing solution — which, by network, may vary dramatically. Thus far, regulators have correctly rejected the call to interfere with this pricing flexibility, absent a demonstration of market failure and consumer harm. This study shows why they would be wise to continue doing so. A working paper version was published by the Mercatus Center in October 2012...|$|E

50|$|<b>Shielding</b> <b>cables</b> - In general, using <b>shielded</b> <b>cables</b> {{to protect}} the wires from {{unwanted}} noise frequencies in a sensitive circuit is good practice. A shielded wire {{can be thought of}} as a small Faraday cage for a specific wire as it uses a plastic or rubber enclosing the true wire. Just outside the rubber/plastic covering is a conductive metal that intercepts any noise signal. Because the conductive metal is grounded, the noise signal runs straight to ground before ever getting to the true wire. It is important to ground the shield at only one end to avoid a ground loop on the shield.|$|R

The high power, ultra-precision PMSM is applied to a computer numerical control (CNC) grinding machine. The conducted EMI prediction model mainly includes multi-core <b>shielded</b> <b>cable,</b> high frequency (HF) converter and PMSM models. The multi-transmission line (MTL) theory is employed to establish the multi-core <b>shielded</b> <b>cable</b> considering their coupling effect caused by the control pairs.

The HF equivalent circuit model of the PMSM is obtained combining the methods of impedance measurement and vector fitting method. The influence of the rotor position on the PMSM impedance measurement is considered. The common mode (CM) and differential mode (DM) interference voltage and current both for the output of inverter and the input of PMSM terminals are conducted by using the prediction model.

This is intended to provide protection against induced electromagnetic interference from lightning. This network provides a normally-high impedance which breaks down to a very low impedance in response to a momentary voltage surge electromagnetically induced in the shield. This establishes a conductive path between the shield and ground. Any surge voltage from lightning creates a current through the cable. This results in an electromagnetic field of the opposite direction, which cancels or reduces the magnitude of the electromagnetic field within the <b>shielded</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|R
