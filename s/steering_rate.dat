40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{measurement}} of anticipated interest rate policy {{and the effects of}} these expectations on the term structure of nominal interest rates. It is shown that, under the expectations hypothesis, the level of long-term interest rates depends on three factors: the level of the monetary policy interest rate, ie the steering rate; the spread between the market interest rate and the steering rate; and market expectations of the next <b>steering</b> <b>rate</b> change. The theoretical model builds on the assumption that market participants have only imperfect knowledge of the mechanism whereby changes in the <b>steering</b> <b>rate</b> are determined. As a consequence, expectations formation, although realistic, need not be entirely rational. <b>Steering</b> <b>rate</b> changes take the form of discrete jumps and occur infrequently on a daily scale. Given these assumptions, discussion of the determination of the term structure is related to the literature on uncertainty about monetary policy regimes and small samples, ie "peso" problems. Empirical analysis based on Nelson–Siegel estimates of the daily yield curves in Finland in the period 1 January 1993 to 31 October 1997 complements the theoretical discussion. The observed differences between estimated market expectations and actual tender rate changes are quite large in the sample, particularly for the longer maturities. The approach applied in this study is promising, not only in the sense of potentially providing estimates of market expectations concerning future discrete changes in monetary policy interest rates but also in the sense of its apparent potential in accounting for the often reported poor empirical performance of the expectations hypothesis. term structure of interest rates; expectations; target changes; peso problems...|$|E

30|$|DB {{systems can}} {{slow down the}} vehicle and make the driver feel safe under {{high-speed}} conditions. In addition, the trajectory deviation caused by DB is smaller than that caused by AS. DB systems can also be easily implemented in conventional braking systems. For instance, electronic stability programs, electronic stability control (ESC), and direct yaw moment control (DYC) are widely used in heavy-duty vehicles, which apply DB or driving torques on wheels such that the vehicle active safety can be greatly improved [4 – 6]. By contrast, AS systems can generate an external yaw movement by actively turning the vehicle wheels in a small range [7]. Three types of AS, namely active front steering (AFS) [8, 9], active rear steering (ARS) [10], and four-wheel steering [11], are defined in existing literature. The AS system cannot generate the required yaw moment under certain circumstances [12]. The control effects and limits of AS and DB have been extensively discussed in literature. Koibuchi et al. [13] discussed {{the pros and cons}} of the DB system for a passenger car and concluded that when an inward moment is needed, the braking force is applied to the rear-inner wheel and vice versa.

40|$|High speed {{cornering}} of an {{off-road vehicle}} poses considerable {{challenges to the}} development of an autonomous vehicle due to the non-linear dynamics of the tyre road interface {{as well as those of}} the vehicle as a whole during high lateral accelerations. Most driver models are developed for low speed applications using linear control methods under the assumption of linear vehicle dy- namics. The dynamics of a vehicle however become highly non-linear as the lateral acceleration increases, thus rendering these linear models unusable during high speed manoeuvres. In this study, two robust driver models for use in an autonomous vehicle capable of path following at both low and high speeds are presented. Both models make use of the relationship between the yaw acceleration and <b>steering</b> <b>rate</b> to control the yaw angle of the vehicle. The first driver model is derived from the simulation of a full non-linear vehicle model in ADAMS. The Magic Tyre Formula is used to model the relationship between the vehicle's yaw acceleration and steer rate as a function of vehicle speed. The second driver model is a mathematical model which incorporates a form of sliding control. The model includes the lateral tyre dynamics as modelled by the Pacejka ' 89 tyre model. Both driver models are coupled with a gain scheduling proportional derivative controller to reduce the cross-track error. The two driver models were implemented on a Land Rover Defender and experimentally validated by performing a double lane change manoeuvre at speeds up to 80 km/h. The vehicle remained stable even though the lateral accelerations experienced were 80 % of the vehicle limits. The result is a robust controller capable of path following at various speeds and at high lateral accelerations. CopyrightDissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|The {{influence}} of driver distraction on driving performance {{is not yet}} well understood, but it can have detrimental effects on road safety. In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} visual and non-visual distractions during driving, using a high-fidelity driving simulator. The visual task was presented either at an offset angle on an in-vehicle screen, or {{on the back of a}} moving lead vehicle. Similar to results from previous studies in this area, non-visual (cognitive) distraction resulted in improved lane keeping performance and increased gaze concentration towards the centre of the road, compared to baseline driving, and further examination of the steering control metrics indicated an increase in <b>steering</b> wheel reversal <b>rates,</b> <b>steering</b> wheel acceleration, and steering entropy. We show, for the first time, that when the visual task is presented centrally, drivers’ lane deviation reduces (similar to non-visual distraction), whilst measures of steering control, overall, indicated more steering activity, compared to baseline. When using a visual task that required the diversion of gaze to an in-vehicle display, but without a manual element, lane keeping performance was similar to baseline driving. <b>Steering</b> wheel reversal <b>rates</b> were found to adequately tease apart the effects of non-visual distraction (increase of 0. 5 degree reversals) and visual distraction with offset gaze direction (increase of 2. 5 degree reversals).

40|$|Trajectory {{tracking}} is {{an important}} aspect of autonomous vehicles. The idea behind trajectory tracking is the ability of the vehicle to follow a predefined path with zero steady state error. The difficulty arises due to the nonlinearity of vehicle dynamics. Therefore, this paper proposes a stable tracking control for an autonomous vehicle. An approach that consists of steering wheel control and lateral control is introduced. This control algorithm is used for a non-holonomic navigation problem, namely tracking a reference trajectory in a closed loop form. A proposed future prediction point control algorithm is used to calculate the vehicle’s lateral error in order to improve the performance of the trajectory tracking. A feedback sensor signal from the steering wheel angle and yaw rate sensor is used as feedback information for the controller. The controller consists of a relationship between the future point lateral error, the linear velocity, the heading error and the reference yaw rate. This paper also introduces a spike detection algorithm to track the spike error that occurs during GPS reading. The proposed idea is to take the advantage of the derivative of the <b>steering</b> <b>rate.</b> This paper aims to tackle the lateral error problem by applying the steering control law to the vehicle, and proposes a new path tracking control method by considering the future coordinate of the vehicle and the future estimated lateral error. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated by a simulation and a GPS experiment with noisy data. The approach used in this paper is not limited to autonomous vehicles alone since the concept of autonomous vehicle tracking can be used in mobile robot platforms, as the kinematic model of these two platforms is similar...|$|E
40|$|Through {{the years}} of {{automotive}} development driving safety {{has been one of}} the primary areas of concern. Inappropriate driver behaviour and insufficient driving skill are considered the primary causes of road accidents. Advanced driver assist systems are becoming increasingly important in their role of increasing driver safety. However, these technological advancements are not driver specific and often benchmark the average driver performance. A solution is to gain knowledge of the differences in driver skill and their relation to driver performance. In this thesis the steering behaviour of novice, experienced and expert drivers is investigated. Three experiments were analysed to research the differences between these drivers on a demanding racetrack, a double lane change and in a high and low friction cornering manoeuvre. In the first experiment expert drivers showed increased steering activity and differences in path strategy compared to normal drivers to achieve their better performance (faster lap-times and higher average lateral acceleration). Participants with more driving experience achieved better performance in the double lane change task (number of cones hit and deviation from the mid-path) and also in the cornering manoeuvre (faster lap-times and higher average lateral acceleration). Significant differences were found in driver control actions, showing higher steering activity in terms of <b>steering</b> <b>rate,</b> steering jerk and steering reversals for the expert and experienced drivers for the cornering tasks. Furthermore, differences were found in the path strategy and path consistency between the experts and normal drivers. In the double lane change test, novices show incorrect timing of the control action and hence provide late initial steering input and try to over compensate in a later stage, resulting in poor performance in terms of deviation from the mid-path and the number of cones hit. These results confirm previous findings in literature that increased control activity can lead to better performance and may lead to a future classification system of drivers based on their steering behaviour.
