In this world, the Roanoke Colony did not disappear in the 1580s; when Steve Rogers went into this world he saved the colony, {{which would have been}} killed by starvation. Dare touches the rift caused by Roger's arrival. She has the ability to transform into white-furred animals when frightened, which she later learns to control, and appears to be the equivalent to Alpha Flight's <b>Snowbird</b> who has a similar appearance and powers, though Neil Gaiman had denied this.|$|E

William Holland Thomas, a white storeowner and state {{legislator}} from Jackson County, North Carolina, helped over 600 Cherokee from Qualla Town obtain North Carolina citizenship, which exempted them from forced removal. Over 400 other Cherokee either hid from Federal troops in the remote <b>Snowbird</b> Mountains, {{under the leadership of}} Tsali (ᏣᎵ), or belonged to in the former Valley Towns area around the Cheoah River who negotiated to stay in North Carolina with the state government. An additional 400 Cherokee stayed on reserves in Southeast Tennessee, North Georgia, and Northeast Alabama, as citizens of their respective states, mostly mixed-bloods and Cherokee women married to white men. Together, these groups were the basis for what is now known as the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.|$|E
