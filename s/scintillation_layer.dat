40|$|The spatial {{resolution}} of currently commercially available X-ray scintillators {{is limited by}} their thickness. For instance a scintillator with a high thickness, yields a high efficiency but suffers from a decrease in {{spatial resolution}} due to (optical) light spreading in the <b>scintillation</b> <b>layer.</b> For thinner scintillators the opposing case is observed. The filling of structures like self-organized aluminum oxide (Alox), permits the fabrication of very thick and therefore highly efficient scintillator matrices without losing spatial resolution, due to the matrix' channel-like structures which act as light guides. We filled such structured Alox-matrices with different scintillator materials with two different methods. Non-hygroscopic scintillators like GOS or LSO can by filled into the matrices by a sedimentation process, but hygroscopic materials like CsI:Tl require a 'dry' process like melting. The focus {{of this paper is}} on the evaluation of the X-ray imaging properties of these filled matrices with respect to the achievable spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Especially for the CsI:Tl filled matrix we also studied the optical emission spectra, due to a loss of the dopant thallium during the melting process...|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by Springer {{and can be found}} at: [URL] phoswich detector with two <b>scintillation</b> <b>layers</b> has been designed and assembled at Oregon State University. This detector is able to identify and reject Compton events and ultimately reduce the Compton continuum in gamma energy spectra. In this detector, CsI(Tl) crystal is used to primarily detect photoelectric events. The CsI(Tl) crystal is partially surrounded by a BGO crystal layer to capture and identify Compton-scattered photons. Both crystals are optically coupled to a single photomultiplier tube. A real-time, FPGA-based digital pulse shape analysis was developed to discriminate and reject Compton-induced pulses from the CsI(Tl) crystal. All the digital pulse processing functions including pulse shape discrimination analysis, pile-up rejection and energy measurement were implemented in an on-board FPGA device.

40|$|Scintillator based {{flat panel}} {{detectors}} are {{state of the}} art in the field of industrial X-ray imaging applications. Choosing the proper system and setup parameters for the vast range of different applications can be a time consuming task, especially when developing new detector systems. Since the system behaviour cannot always be foreseen easily, Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations are keys to gain further knowledge of system components and their behaviour for different imaging conditions. In this work we used two Monte-Carlo based models to examine an indirect converting flat panel detector, specifically the Hamamatsu C 9312 SK. We focused on the signal generation in the <b>scintillation</b> <b>layer</b> and its influence on the spatial resolution of the whole system. The models differ significantly in their level of complexity. The first model gives a global description of the detector based on different parameters characterizing the spatial resolution. With relatively small effort a simula tion model can be developed which equates the real detector regarding signal transfer. The second model allows a more detailed insight of the system. It is based on the well established cascade theory, i. e. describing the detector as a cascade of elemental gain and scattering stages, which represent the built in components and their signal transfer behaviour. In comparison to the first model the influence of single components especially the important light spread behaviour in the scintillator can be analysed in a more differentiated way. Although the implementation of the second model is more time consuming both models have in common that a relatively small amount of system manufacturer parameters are needed. The results of both models were in good agreement with the measured parameters of the real system...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{establish}} the methods for sinogram formation and correction {{in order to}} appropriately apply the filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstruction algorithm to the data acquired using PET scanner with multiple <b>scintillation</b> crystal <b>layers.</b> Materials and Methods: Formation for raw PET data storage and conversion methods from listmode data to histogram and sinogram were optimized. To solve the various problems occurred while the raw histogram was converted into sinogram, optimal sampling strategy and sampling efficiency correction method were investigated. Gap compensation methods that is unique in this system were also investigated. All the sinogram data were reconstructed using 2 D filtered backprojection algorithm and compared to estimate the improvements by the correction algorithms. Results: Optimal radial sampling interval and number of angular samples {{in terms of the}} sampling theorem and sampling efficiency correction algorithm were pitch/ 2 and 120, respectively. By applying the sampling efficiency correction and gap compensation, artifacts and background noise on the reconstructed image could be reduced.

40|$|The MACRO {{detector}} {{approved for}} the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory in Italy {{will be the}} first capable of performing a definitive search for super-massive grand unified theory (GUT) monopoles at a level significantly below the Parker flux limit of 10 to the minus 15 th power square centimeters Sr(- 1) 5 (- 1). GUT monopoles will move at very low velocities (V approx. 0. 001 c) relative to the Earth and a multifaceted detection technique is required to assume their unambiguous identification. Calculations of scintillator response to slow monopoles and measurements of scintillation efficiency for low energy protons have shown that bare monopoles and electrically charged monopoles moving at velocities as low as 5 x. 0001 c will produce detectable scintillation signals. The time-of-flight between two thick (25 cm) liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>layers</b> separated by 4. 3 m will be used in conjunction with waveform digitization of signals of extended duration in each thick scintillator to provide a redundant signature for slow penetrating particles.

40|$|The nasal {{administration}} of drugs offers advantages over administration by intravenous injection. Drugs can be rapidly absorbed through the nasal mucosa, {{resulting in a}} rapid onset of action, and also avoiding degradation in the gastrointestinal tract and first-pass metabolism in the liver. The olfactory receptor cells, which are {{in direct contact with}} both the environment and the central nervous system (CNS), are potential routes for drugs into the CNS. The olfactory pathway thus circumvents the blood brain barrier (BBB) which prevents many systemically administered drugs from entering the brain. The studies used compounds active in the CNS and the experiments were performed in rodents. The nasal bioavailability of (S) -UH- 301, NXX- 066 and [3 H]-dopamine was investigated in a rat model; uptake into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was compared after nasal and intravenous administration. The concentrations of S-UH- 301 and NXX- 066 in plasma and CSF were measured with high performance liquid chromatography. The possible transfer of dopamine and neurotensin along the olfactory pathway after nasal administration to mice was studied using brain tissue sampling and autoradiography. The radioactivity content in blood, CSF and dissected brain tissue samples after {{administration of}} [3 H]-dopamine and [3 H]-neurotensin was assessed using liquid <b>scintillation,</b> and thin <b>layer</b> chromatography (TLC) was used to investigate the metabolic fate of [3 H]-dopamine. The results of this thesis suggest that nasal administration of CNS-active compounds with low oral bioavailability is an interesting and workable alternative to intravenous injection. The small lipophilic compounds (S) -UH- 301 and NXX- 066 were rapidly and completely absorbed after nasal administration, although hard evidence of direct transfer from the nose remains elusive. Radioactivity measurements in the olfactory bulb following nasal administration of [3 H]-dopamine and [3 H]-neurotensin indicate that transfer occurred. The TLC results showed the presence of unchanged dopamine in the olfactory bulb but it is less clear from initial results with neurotensin, which radioactive products of this molecule reached the olfactory bulb, and further studies are required...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{regulatory}} pressures (e. g., REACh, CEPA) requiring bioaccumulation {{assessments and}} the need for reduced animal use have increased the necessity for the development of in vitro-based methods to estimate bioaccumulation. Our study explored the potential use of subcellular and cellular hepatic systems to determine the biotransformation potential of two surfactants: octaethylene glycol monohexadecyl ether (C 16 EO 8) and diethylene glycol monotetradecyl ether sulfate (C 14 EO 2 S). The subcellular systems tested were liver homogenates and microsomes from the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Cellular systems consisted of primary hepatocytes from the common carp (C. carpio) and PLHC- 1 cells, hepatocarcinoma cells from the desert topminnow (Poeciliopsis lucida) cell line. Each in vitro system was exposed to radiolabeled test compounds and assayed for biotransformation using liquid <b>scintillation</b> and thin <b>layer</b> chromatographic methods. First-order kinetics were used to estimate rates of biotransformation. Bioconcentration of test materials in fish were predicted using an in vitro to in vivo metabolic rate extrapolation model linked to a mass-balance model commonly used to predict bioaccumulation in fish. Both subcellular and cellular tests using microsomes, liver homogenates and hepatocytes respectively showed biotransformation of the parent surfactants. Biotransformation rates were fastest for hepatocytes, followed by microsomes and homogenates. Rates were too low from homogenate tests to extrapolate to in vivo-based biotransformation rates using the extrapolation model. Trout microsomes metabolized C 16 EO 8 faster than carp microsomes, yet rates were approximately the same for C 14 EO 2 S. Predicted BCF values incorporating in vitro biotransformation rates from hepatocytes were similar to measured in vivo or USEPA's bioconcentration model (BCFWIN) predicted values. Predicted BCF values using microsomal-based rates from trout and carp studies were only slightly less than default BCF values which assumes a linear logKow to BCF relationship with no biotransformation. However, hepatocyte-based results showed substantially decreased BCFs compared to the default BCF values. These results indicate that BCF estimates based on in vitro metabolic rates can provide reasonable estimates of in vivo BCF values, therefore, supporting the use of in vitro approaches within a tiered approach to assess bioconcentration...|$|R
