5|$|Differences {{of opinion}} over social order between {{northern}} and southern states in early United States society, particularly regarding the slavery of Africans and African Americans, ultimately led to the American Civil War. Initially, states entering the Union alternated between <b>slave</b> <b>and</b> free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between <b>slave</b> <b>and</b> free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.|$|E
5|$|The Greeks {{had many}} degrees of enslavement. There was a {{multitude}} of categories, ranging from free citizen to chattel <b>slave,</b> <b>and</b> including Penestae or helots, disenfranchised citizens, freedmen, bastards, and metics. The common ground was the deprivation of civic rights.|$|E
5|$|Back in New Orleans, St. Clare debates slavery {{with his}} Northern cousin Ophelia who, while {{opposing}} slavery, is prejudiced against black people.

5|$|James Parsons III and {{his brother}} William Miller Parsons (born 1835) were later proprietors of the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser.

5|$|After {{losing the}} {{election}} to Abraham Lincoln, Breckinridge worked for adoption of the Crittenden Compromise—authored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden—as a means of preserving the Union. Breckinridge believed the Crittenden proposal—restoring the Missouri Compromise line as the separator between <b>slave</b> <b>and</b> free territory in exchange for stricter enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and federal non-interference with slavery in the territories and Washington, D.C.—was the most extreme proposal to which the South would agree. Ultimately, the compromise was rejected and the Civil War soon followed.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of a {{selection}} of inscriptions from Trier and Mainz, the article focuses on the question whether and to what extend <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> freedmen were able to integrate themselves into the society by their religious activities. It became obvious that by means of their dedications, <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> freedmen were taking part in the municipal cult of the city, a pagus or a military site. Furthermore, this way they also could display their economic success. But nevertheless, it was only a small group of <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> freedmen that was able to participate in these cults and to show off their social and local integration : These were especially public <b>and</b> imperial <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> freedmen - often working for the Roman administration...|$|R

Tchaikovsky did not live to conduct the other three concerts, as he died on November 6, 1893. Rimsky-Korsakov stood in for him at the second of these events, an all-Tchaikovsky concert in memory of the composer, on December 12, 1893.

5|$|Believing {{that men}} {{should not be}} given {{the right to vote}} without women also being granted the franchise, Sojourner Truth, a former <b>slave</b> <b>and</b> feminist, {{affiliated}} herself with Stanton and Anthony's organization.

Despite Stanton's position and the efforts of her and others to expand the Fifteenth Amendment to include voting rights for all women, this amendment also passed, as it was originally written, in 1870.|$|E

5|$|Following Sévérine's first {{appearances}} in promotional materials for Skyfall, film critics {{noted that the}} character was {{a return to the}} classic elements of the James Bond films, specifically Bond meeting a beautiful and mysterious woman. Critics had a mixed response to Sévérine, comparing her to previous Bond girls. The response to Bond's treatment of Sévérine was largely negative; commentators panned Bond's seduction of the character after discovering that she was a sex <b>slave,</b> <b>and</b> his cold response to her death. However, some critics defended Sévérine's story arc as appropriate for Bond's character development. The character has also been a topic of racial criticism, receiving comparisons to previous Bond girls Aki, Kissy Suzuki, and Wai Lin.|$|E

5|$|Work {{performed}} by slaves falls into five general categories: domestic, with epitaphs recording at least 55 different household jobs; imperial or public service; urban crafts and services; agriculture; and mining. Convicts provided {{much of the}} labour in the mines or quarries, where conditions were notoriously brutal. In practice, there was little division of labour between <b>slave</b> <b>and</b> free, and most workers were illiterate and without special skills. The greatest number of common labourers were employed in agriculture: in the Italian system of industrial farming (latifundia), these may have been mostly slaves, but throughout the Empire, slave farm labour was probably less important than other forms of dependent labour by people who were technically not enslaved.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1830s, liberal and radical boyars, {{many of whom}} studied in Western Europe, {{particularly}} in Paris, had taken the first steps toward the anti-slavery goal. During that period, Ion Câmpineanu, like the landowning brothers Nicolae and Ştefan Golescu, emancipated all his slave retinue, while boyar Emanoil Bălăceanu freed his <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> organized for them the Scăieni Phalanstery, an utopian socialist community. In 1836, Wallachian Prince Alexandru II Ghica freed 4,000 domneşti <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> had a group of landowners sign them up as paid workforce, while instigating a policy through which the state purchased privately owned <b>slaves</b> <b>and</b> set them free.|$|R
