40|$|Australia 2 ̆ 7 s {{industrial}} relations framework has undergone substantial change since the 1990 s. This has involved {{federal and state}} governments attempting to replace the <b>centralised</b> <b>system,</b> based on awards, to a decentralised system based on formalised enterprise and individual bargaining. The move to a decentralised system will supposedly, according to critics of the <b>centralised</b> <b>system,</b> provide significant improvements in flexibility, especially for the hospitality industry. This article examines the results from two studies of registered clubs, one undertaken in New South Wales (NSW) in 1996 and the other in Queensland in 2003, to examine the impact of regulatory changes on wage determination and associated variables in the sector. The findings indicate that despite the rhetoric of proponents of decentralisation, very few clubs have moved from the <b>centralised</b> <b>system</b> to the decentralised one. However, within the <b>centralised</b> <b>system,</b> clubs have undertaken a high level of informal bargaining, both in 1996 and 2003. Despite the level of informal bargaining club managers felt relatively restricted by awards and trade unions...|$|R
40|$|Main {{issues of}} {{complexity}} in a <b>centralised</b> <b>system</b> are explored, taking Austria as a case. The overall argument connects three interrelated topics of governing complexity in education: (1) {{an analysis of}} the sources of complexity in a <b>centralised</b> <b>system,</b> showing that centralisation-decentralisation is rather a continuum than a dichotomy; (2) an exploration of relations between structures in a centralised polity and policy and politics in education; (3) the production and use of knowledge and the knowledge flows as a key ingredient of governing complexity. The existing governance structures mediate between policy making and practice, and their shape depends more on the demands of power politics than on technical policy arguments of how to achieve efficacy and efficiency, at least in a <b>centralised</b> <b>system.</b> In such a system much part of its complexity is hidden behind existing formal regulations that superficially seem to ‘rationalise’ the practices of policy making...|$|R

The discussion is empowered by an evaluative case study research undertaken to understand the development of inclusion in contexts where flexible teaching and curriculum change are sometimes hard to find. In particular, based on a systems approach, this research describes and evaluates an attempt in a Greek primary school to implement inclusive practices, aiming to analyse the problems and prospects of inclusion in a highly <b>centralised</b> <b>system,</b> entirely controlled by the Ministry of Education. The inclusive practices developed in this school {{were based on a}} collaborative teacher model, offering new roles to mainstream teachers. The research data come from a diary, group interviews, classroom and meetings observations, and document analysis. The study reveals several obstacles to inclusion, besides the good practices which promote it. The main argument is that a <b>centralised</b> <b>system</b> favours the integration of students with disabilities more than their inclusion...|$|R

50|$|In {{information}} security, computational {{trust is}} {{the generation of}} trusted authorities or user trust through cryptography. In <b>centralised</b> <b>systems,</b> security is typically based on the authenticated identity of external parties. Rigid authentication mechanisms, such as Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) or Kerberos have allowed this model to be extended to distributed systems within a few closely collaborating domains or within a single administrative domain. During recent years, computer science has moved from <b>centralised</b> <b>systems</b> to distributed computing. This evolution has several implications for security models, policies and mechanisms needed to protect users’ information and resources in an increasingly interconnected computing infrastructure.|$|R

Background Every day, millions of people communicate electronically via the In-ternet. The vast majority of this communication is transmitted in the clear[Mannan and van Oorschot 2006]. Much of this communication relies upon <b>centralised</b> <b>systems,</b> requiring that users give the owners of these systems implicit trust {{if they are to}} communicate at all.

In addition, nine administrative circles (cercles), each controlled by an Intendant, were created to which much {{of the power of the}} states was devolved. A second decree abolished the ad hoc semi-feudal or ecclesiastical courts operated by the states and replaced them with a <b>centralised</b> <b>system</b> similar to that already in place in Austria. A single Sovereign Council of Justice was established in Brussels, with two appeal courts in Brussels and Luxembourg, and around 40 local district courts.|$|R

(author's abstract) Probleme von Komplexität in einem zentralistischen System werden untersucht. Die Argumentation verknüpft drei Aspekte der Governance von Komplexität: (1) die Quellen von Komplexität in einem zentralisierten System, wobei sich eher ein Kontinuum als eine Dichotomie zu dezentralen Strukturen zeigt; (2) Zusammenhänge zwischen den Strukturen einer zentralisierten Polity einerseits und Policy und Politics andererseits; (3) die Produktion und Nutzung von Wissen als Teil der Governance von Komplexität. Die Strukturen (Polity) vermitteln zwischen den politischen Prozessen und der Praxis im Bildungswesen, und diese sind in einem zentralisierten System stärker von der Machtpolitik als von der Sachpolitik bestimmt. Ein großer Teil der Komplexität wird durch die scheinbar ‚rationellen‘ formalen Strukturen versteckt. (Autorenreferat...|$|R
