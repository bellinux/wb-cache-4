The first two battles take place on simple, large, flat areas of land, with the only goal being to discover how to scale the colossi and attack their weak points.

5|$|Many {{language}} studies, {{particularly in}} fMRI, use the subtraction paradigm, in which brain activation in a task thought to involve <b>some</b> <b>aspect</b> of language processing is compared against activation in a baseline task thought to involve similar non-linguistic processes {{but not to}} involve the linguistic process. For example, activations while participants read words may be compared to baseline activations while participants read strings of random letters (in attempt to isolate activation related to lexical processingthe processing of real words), or activations while participants read syntactically complex sentences may be compared to baseline activations while participants read simpler sentences.|$|E

The prophet Jonah is placed above the altar and Zechariah at the further end. The other male and female figures alternate down each side, each being identified by an inscription on a painted marble panel supported by a putto.|$|E

5|$|The {{argument}} from morality {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe <b>some</b> <b>aspect</b> of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at the Necromanteion, the reunited crew is {{attacked}} by Clytius, Pasiphaë, {{and a group}} of their minions. Each of the demigods uses <b>some</b> <b>aspect</b> of their newly strengthened powers or identities to help defeat these monsters; for example, Hazel's new power and alliance with Hecate helps her defeat Pasiphaë and Clytius. During the questers' journey in the mortal world, Percy and Annabeth have been travelling through Tartarus {{to the other side of}} the Doors of Death, aided by the Titan Iapetus (Bob) and a few other beings. As the other demigods fight in the world above, Percy and Annabeth's group reaches the Doors and fights the personification of Tartarus to destroy the chains holding the Doors in place. Bob stays behind amongst hordes of angry monsters to defend the Doors while Percy and Annabeth escape. Once the full quest group is safely reassembled in the mortal world, Reyna arrives on her dying Pegasus. Annabeth says that Reyna, as a Roman, should bring the Athena Parthenos (in the Argo IIs hold) back to Camp Half-Blood to appease both the Greeks and Romans, with Nico and Coach Hedge volunteering to accompany her.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability to}} {{categorize}} {{a case of}} epilepsy into a specific syndrome occurs more often with children since the onset of seizures is commonly early. Less serious examples are benign rolandic epilepsy (2.8 per 100,000), childhood absence epilepsy (0.8 per 100,000) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (0.7 per 100,000). Severe syndromes with diffuse brain dysfunction caused, at least partly, by <b>some</b> <b>aspect</b> of epilepsy, are {{also referred to as}} epileptic encephalopathies. These are associated with frequent seizures that are resistant to treatment and severe cognitive dysfunction, for instance Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and West syndrome. Genetics is believed {{to play an important role}} in epilepsies by a number of mechanisms. Simple and complex modes of inheritance have been identified for some of them. However, extensive screening have failed to identify many single gene variants of large effect. More recent exome and genome sequencing studies have begun to reveal a number of de novo gene mutations that are responsible for some epileptic encephalopathies, including CHD2 and SYNGAP1 and DNM1, GABBR2, FASN and RYR3.|$|E
