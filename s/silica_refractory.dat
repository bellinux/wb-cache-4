40|$|AbstractDuring the {{carbonization}} of coal, {{the thermal}} conditions within the supporting coke oven walls vary substantially. This {{gives rise to}} a continually developing strain field within the walls which could cause cracks to occur in the refractory materials and, thus, shorten the operating life of the oven.

In this work, the authors report equilibrium calculations for the Na{sub 2 }O-SiO{sub 2 } system that predict the formation of a variable-composition liquid-solution phase as a function of key furnace variables. Since thermodynamic data for the relevant liquid phases are unavailable in standard compilations, new data generated using the associate species model are included in the calculations. The calculations indicate that gas-phase NaOH concentrations less than {approximately} 15 ppm will not react with the <b>silica</b> <b>refractory</b> under either air-fired or oxy-fired conditions, since this is the smallest equilibrium NaOH partial pressure in a system containing crystalline SiO{sub 2 } (either cristobalite or tridymite) in equilibrium with a variable-composition sodium-silicate liquid phase at refractory temperatures in the range 1, 400 [...] 1, 700 C.

Both of the materials are found susceptible to cyclic fatigue failure in the strain-controlled mode. Moreover, the stress-strain envelopes in monotonic and cyclic loading tests are found to be different. Fractographic analysis and other complementary techniques revealed the difference is due to the gradual development of micro-damage during the loading cycles. The formation of micro-damage is found responsible for the less brittle failure occurred in cyclic tests.

40|$|An {{innovative}} research program is proposed {{to investigate the}} corrosion of steel by lead alloys, and in particular lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE). In our previous work, some steels {{were found to be}} far more resistant to corrosion by LBE than others depending on surface preparation (cold working). This program would allow testing of crucial hypotheses about the causes of the observed increased corrosion resistance. We propose to build a new test facility at UNLV to expose steel samples to LBE as well as facilities to prepare steel samples as indicated by our work. The unique capabilities of the test system will make investigations of the fundamentals of lead alloy corrosion under a variety of conditions feasible and lead to the establishment of new protocols for the minimization of molten lead alloy corrosion of structural materials. These capabilities include fast and controlled sample introduction via a vacuum load lock system, both high temperature operation and controlled chemical environment by the use of alumina and <b>silica</b> or other <b>refractory</b> materials for lead alloy containment, and highly modifiable flow systems for determination of fundamental kinetics and parameters and thus accurate modeling of lead alloy systems.

40|$|Superalloy {{airfoils}} {{are produced}} by investment casting (IC), which uses ceramic cores and wax patterns with ceramic shell molds. Hollow cored superalloy airfoils in a gas turbine engine are an example of complex IC parts. The complex internal hollow cavities of the airfoil are designed to conduct cooling air through one or more passageways. These complex internal passageways have been fabricated by a lost wax process requiring several processing steps; core preparation, injection molding for wax pattern, and dipping process for ceramic shell molds. Several steps generate problems such as high cost and decreased accuracy of the ceramic mold. For example, costly tooling and production delay are required to produce mold dies for complex cores and wax patterns used in injection molding, resulting in a big obstacle for prototypes and smaller production runs. Rather than using separate cores, patterns, and shell molds, it would be advantageous to directly produce a mold that has the casting cavity and the ceramic core by one process. Ceramic stereolithography (CerSLA) {{can be used to}} directly fabricate the integrally cored ceramic casting mold (ICCM). CerSLA builds ceramic green objects from CAD files from many thin liquid layers of powder in monomer, which are solidified by polymerization with a UV laser, thereby “writing” the design for each slice. This dissertation addresses the integrally cored casting ceramic mold (ICCM), the ceramic core with a ceramic mold shell in a single patternless construction, fabricated by ceramic stereolithography (CerSLA).

The sample, originating from the surface of a <b>refractory</b> <b>silica</b> brick, displays sharp discontinuities in the first moment (M(1)), second moment (M(2)), or both, of the Si- 29 MAS NMR spectrum at the following phase transitions: 108 +/- 1 degrees C for the monoclinic (MC) to orthorhombic (OF) transition, 165 +/- 5 degrees C for the transition from OP to a second orthorhombic phase (OS), and 206 +/- 4 degrees C for the transition from OS to a third orthorhombic phase (OC). M(1) 7 for the OC phase becomes more negative with increasing temperature up to similar to 323 degrees C, at which there is also a small discontinuity in M(2), indicating a transition from OC to a hexagonal phase (LHP). The spectrum of the MC phase consists of 12 narrow lines of equal area, consistent with the known crystal structure. The spectrum of the OP phase is broad and asymmetric, indicating a distribution of local environments at the Si sites. It can be simulated assuming an incommensurate structural modulation with a maximum amplitude of similar to 5 x 10 (- 2) Angstrom, but it is also consistent with a recent domain-formation model, provided that most disorder occurs at the Si 6 site. The spectrum of the OS phase is asymmetric, indicating a nonlinear incommensurate modulation with a maximum amplitude of similar to 2 x 10 (- 2) Angstrom. The spectra of higher temperature phases are consistent with the single Si site of the known crystal structures, but M, values imply significantly smaller mean Si-O-Si angles [alpha], e. g., [alpha] = 152. 6 degrees at 220 degrees C from NMR, compared with 168. 0 degrees from X-ray diffraction data.

40|$|The {{devitrification}} of {{amorphous silica}} to cristobalite {{and the subsequent}} beta-alpha transformation of cristobalite were studied as well the impact of both transformations on mechanical properties. The work was motivated {{by the need to}} transform 3 -D printed green molds composed of acryaltes and 60 vol% <b>silica</b> particles into <b>refractory</b> molds for the casting of single crystal Ni-superalloy. The 3 -D printed molds were produced by Large Area Maskless Photopolymerization (LAMP), a process that selectively cures layers of photo-suspension with patterned UV light to produce solid objects. Cristobalite content was required to achieve sufficient sintering and creep resistance in the in the sintered silica molds. However, cristobalite lowers room temperature strength due to cracking caused by the beta-alpha transition, requiring a compromise between creep resistance and strength. The development of crack-like flaws in LAMP molds prior to sintering was also addressed. The kinetics of the crystallization of amorphous silica to cristobalite was investigated and a time-temperature-transformation or TTT diagram was developed. The impact of seeding with cristobalite powder and use of silica with residual crystalline quartz were examined. The stress relaxation of partially crystalline sintered silica under fixed strain was studied as a function of cristobalite content. The results are used to infer the impact of cristobalite on the creep and sintering resistance of partially crystallized sintered silica. The impact of cristobalite on strength of sintered silica was explored. The strength of partially crystalline sintered silica samples were tested at 350 °C as beta-cristobalite having never cooled through the beta-alpha transition, at 25 °C as alpha-cristobalite having passed the beta-alpha transition, and at 350 °C as beta cristobalite having been cooled through the beta-alpha transition and subsequently reheated.
