40|$|Abstract—Plunge <b>shaving</b> is {{the most}} {{advanced}} gear finishing technique which only needs radial infeed. Its advantages include increased productivity, accuracy, long tool life, and a simple machine structure. For the plunge <b>shaving</b> method, the gear tooth modification only depends on the surface geometry of the plunge <b>shaving</b> cutter. The analytical description of the gear with tooth modifications is firstly constructed by B-spline surface fitting. Then, the grinding wheel profile is parameterized and optimized for minimizing the surface deviations of theoretical and ground (from re-sharpening machine) tooth surfaces of the plunge <b>shaving</b> cutter, in which the topographic error has been reduced. The cutting trace of plunge <b>shaving</b> cutter has also been analyzed so that the <b>shaving</b> efficiency can be improved. Index Terms—Gear plunge <b>shaving,</b> Cone grinding wheel, Topographic error, <b>Shaving</b> cutter serration. et al. [9] proposed a method for <b>shaving</b> gears with double crowning by CNC <b>shaving</b> machine. For <b>shaving</b> methods other than plunge <b>shaving,</b> the gear tooth modification is accomplished by tooth modifications of the <b>shaving</b> cutter and the coordinated motions between cutter and gear. For the plunge <b>shaving</b> method, however, it only depends on the surface geometry of the plunge <b>shaving</b> cutter. Focusing on the surface geometry of <b>shaving</b> cutter, what’s really significant is precision of the region between SAP. (start of active profile) and EAP. (end of active profile) as shown in Fig. 1. In gear <b>shaving,</b> SAP. of cutter tooth <b>shaves</b> the gear tooth tip while EAP. <b>shaves</b> the gear tooth root. Traditionally, the cutter surface geometry results from a cutter re-sharpening machine by trial and error, which is very time-consuming. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —Competition with gizzard <b>shad</b> Dorosoma cepedianum {{has been}} shown to {{influence}} survival of larval bluegills Lepomis macrochirus as well as growth and size structure of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, which prey on these planktivorous species. However, little is known about how the presence of gizzard <b>shad</b> influences bluegills beyond the larval stage. We examined bluegill–gizzard <b>shad</b> interactions across 10 reservoirs with and 10 without gizzard <b>shad</b> to de-termine direct and indirect effects of gizzard <b>shad</b> on bluegill population size structure. In the presence of gizzard <b>shad,</b> bluegills exhibited smaller adult (. 3 years old) size structure. Benthic invertebrate densities were higher in non-gizzard <b>shad</b> reservoirs, which may have contributed to increased bluegill growth in these systems. In contrast, zooplankton densities were similar in reservoirs with and without gizzard <b>shad.</b> Turbidity was higher in reservoirs with gizzard <b>shad,</b> which may have reduced foraging success and growth of bluegill. Finally, higher bluegill densities occurred in reservoirs with gizzard <b>shad,</b> which may have resulted from decreased largemouth bass predation due to gizzard <b>shad</b> availability as alternative prey. These results demonstrate that the presence of gizzard <b>shad</b> is associated with reduced bluegill growth rates and adult size structure and that mechanisms other than direct competition for food resources may be responsible. Gizzard <b>shad</b> Dorosoma cepedianum is a com-mon freshwater fish species that can predominate fish biomass in many central and southern U. S. reservoirs (Johnson et al. 1988; DeVries and Stein 1992; Stein et al. 1995). Occupying an interme-diate trophic level, gizzard <b>shad</b> can have tremen-dous influence on reservoir systems through middle-out community regulation (Stein et al. 1995). Foraging by gizzard <b>shad</b> can influence zoo-plankton and phytoplankton communities (Crame...|$|R
