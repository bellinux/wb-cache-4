In July 1578, Lord Burghley, acting for the Privy Council, attempted to resolve the deadlock over the South Holland drain.

Four special commissioners, including Carelton, were appointed to design a course for the drain and were assisted by the engineer Humphrey Bradley. There is no evidence that any work was carried out, and it was not until 1793 that construction of the drain began.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{nonlinear}} {{dynamics of}} micromechanical oscil-lators are explored experimentally. Devices consist of singly and doubly <b>supported</b> Si <b>beams,</b> 200 nm thick and 35 μm long. When illuminated within a laser interference field, devices self-oscillate {{in their first}} bending mode due to feedback between laser heating and device displacement. Compressive prestress buckles doubly <b>supported</b> <b>beams</b> leading to a strong amplitude–frequency relationship. Significant frequency instability is seen in doubly <b>supported</b> devices. Self-resonant <b>beams</b> are also driven inertially with varying drive amplitude and frequency. Regions of primary, sub-, and superharmonic entrainment are measured. Statistics of primary entrainment are measured for low drive amplitudes, where the effects of frequency instability are measurable. Sub-and superharmonic entrainment are not seen in singly <b>supported</b> <b>beams.</b> A simple model is built to explain why high-order entrainment is seen only in doubly <b>supported</b> <b>beams.</b> Its analysis suggests that the strong amplitude–frequency relationship in doubly <b>supported</b> <b>beams</b> enables hysteresis, wide regions of primary entrainment, and high orders of sub- and superharmonic entrainment.

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{variable}} stiffness elastic principle, completed three series of variable stiffness elastic suspension system {{design for the}} ocean pipe laying tensioners,effectively improved the clamping ability of the tensioner when the local pipe diameter is changing, and improved the overall stress environment of the tensioner. Established non-linear mathematical model and got the impact of instant response and response force by using the Matlab software. Foreword Suspension system {{is the most important}} component of the tensioner, and it is the transmission and supporting equipment between tensioner and the pipeline. Its role is to transmit the vertical force and torque to the frame, and through the frame to the deck, to ensure the safety and stability of the tensioner. The traditional tensioners are mostly applying the way of installing {{the variable}} stiffness springs on the large-scale <b>supporting</b> <b>beam.</b> For example hydraulic springs and air springs. In order to prevent the supporting rollers moving to the transverse, all the variable stiffness springs are linked together by the special rods, and one end is fixed on the <b>supporting</b> <b>beam.</b> This structure permits the pipelines pass through the tensioner, however there are man...|$|E
40|$|While {{environmental}} vibrations {{are usually}} {{in the range of}} a few hundred Hertz, small-form-factor piezoelectric vibration energy harvesters will have higher resonant frequencies due to the structural size effect. To address this issue, we propose a resonant frequency-down conversion based on the theory of dynamic vibration absorber for the design of a small-form-factor piezoelectric vibration energy harvester. The proposed energy harvester consists of two frequency-tuned elastic components for lowering the first resonant frequency of an integrated system but is so configured that an energy harvesting beam component is inverted with respect to the other <b>supporting</b> <b>beam</b> component for a small form factor. Furthermore, in order to change the unwanted modal characteristic of small separation of resonant frequencies, {{as is the case with}} an inverted configuration, a proof mass on the <b>supporting</b> <b>beam</b> component is slightly shifted toward a second proof mass on the tip of the energy harvesting beam component. The proposed small-form-factor design capability was experimentally verified using a fabricated prototype with an occupation volume of 20 × 39 × 6. 9 mm 3, which was designed for a target frequency of as low as 100 Hz...|$|E
40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: Recent {{earthquake}} engineering research has raised {{concerns of the}} seismic performance of precast prestressed concrete hollow-core floor systems. Experimental research showed that with simple detailing enhancements, significant improvement in the seismic performance of hollow-core floor systems can be expected. The present experimental research aims at validating several new detailing enhancements. Based on previous research findings, the present super-assemblage experiment included the following details: (i) a reinforced connection that rigidly ties the floor into the <b>supporting</b> <b>beam,</b> (ii) an articulated topping slab portion cast onto a timber infill solution that runs parallel to the hollow-core units and edge beams; (iii) specially detailed <b>supporting</b> <b>beam</b> plastic hinge zones reducing potential damage to the hollow-core units; (iv) Grade 500 E reinforcing steel used in the main frame elements; and (v) mild steel deformed bars in the concrete topping {{in lieu of the}} customary welded wire mesh. The full-scale structure was cyclically tested in both the longitudinal and transverse directions to inter-storey drifts of ± 5 %. Observations show extremely positive results with minor damage incurred by the hollow-core flooring and the overall performance dictated by the performance of the moment resisting frame. Recommendations for the forthcoming revision of the New Zealand Concrete Standard, NZS 3101, are also made. ...|$|E
