40|$|The {{retanning}} {{process is}} the main application of formaldehyde in the tanning industry since formaldehyde participates in two groups of synthetic organic tanning agents: <b>syntans</b> and resins.

This method allows high-resolution separation of polymers. CNSF contained linear NSA oligomers (n = 1 - 11) that were eluted in order of increasing degree of polymerization. The area under the peaks was correlated to the concentration.

40|$|Today we are {{experiencing}} an "eco friendly boom"; {{which includes the}} developing of ecological processes that have a smaller impact in the environment. This {{is the reason that}} prompted me to carrying out this thesis; the aim is to use a vegetable extract as a sustainable product for the pre-tanning processes. This study considers the use of the fruit of the Tara tree as a raw material source of tannins with low carbon footprint and proposes alternatives to avoid or reduce the use of commercial vegetable extracts, synthetic products and mineral salts that require non sustainable processes. Various experimental designs have been developed as to obtain new tailored Tara tannins by both chemical and physical modification, in order to obtain a higher percentage of tannins, and therefore improve its tanning capability, also reducing the astringency and improving the penetration of the tannin molecules through the leather structure. In chemical modifications, several aqueous extractions at different temperatures and combined with some chemicals, have been developed and optimized in order to increase the tannin content and reduce the astringency. The degree of hydrolysis has controlled by measuring the Gallic acid content by means of HPLC (High performance liquid Chromatography). In the physical modification part, the Tara has been milled and sieved, at several particle sizes, with the aim of obtaining a smaller molecular size. Both chemical and physical modifications were tested in hides, in a wet-white pre-tanning process, combining them with the fewest possible commercial vegetable extracts and <b>syntans.</b> The formulations have been optimized by experimental design. All the resulting leather products and final baths have been analyzed with physical and chemical tests respectively, to determine if they comply with the parameters established by the IULTCS (International Union of Leather Technologists and Chemists Societies).

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia QuímicaAs preocupações ambientais associadas à indústria dos curtumes centram-se no curtume com crómio, uma das etapas mais poluentes de todo o processo. Actualmente, 80 a 90 % das peles, em todo o mundo, são curtidas com crómio (wet blue), é do interesse de todos a busca por um processo isento de crómio, de forma a obter um couro mais ecológico, o wet white. A pele é formada por uma rede complexa de fibras de colagénio que são estabilizadas através da formação de cross-links inter e intramoleculares, que lhe confere as propriedades físicas. Quando aquecidas em água essas fibras encolhem, devido ao processo de desnaturação, a temperatura à qual ocorre é designada por temperatura de encolhimento (Ts). O curtume vai criar ligações que conferem maior estabilidade às fibras elevando a sua Ts. Uma das vantagens do crómio como agente de curtume é a elevada estabilidade hidrotérmica que confere ao couro, obtendo Ts {{superior}} a 100 ºC. Foram desenvolvidos processos com diferentes agentes de curtume, de forma a encontrar alternativas ao crómio. Efectuaram-se ensaios de curtume mineral, com crómio, zircónio e silicatos; curtume vegetal, com extracto de mimosa, quebracho e genipina; curtume sintético, com tanino sintético, resina acrílica e gluteraldeído; e finalmente curtumes mistos, combinando processos dos curtumes anteriores. Foi avaliada a estabilidade hidrotérmica das peles processadas pelos métodos desenvolvidos pela determinação das Ts (norma ISO 3380 e banho termostatizado). Usou-se a calorimetria diferencial de varrimento (DSC), de forma a determinar a variação de entalpia associada à desnaturação do colagénio. Para um estudo mais detalhado foi realizada a análise dos espectros FTIR-ATR permitindo identificar alterações na estrutura da pele, quer na sequência do processo de curtume, quer após o encolhimento da pele. Os resultados obtidos que permitem propor processos alternativos ao crómio, com elevadas Ts e menos poluentes, um dos quais já com implementação na indústria. The {{environmental concerns}} {{generated by the}} tanning industry focuses on chrome tanning, {{one of the most}} polluting parts of the process. Currently, 80 to 90 % of the hides worldwide are tanned using chrome (wet-blue). The effort to produce chrome-free leather, a wet white, in order to obtain a more ecological leather is increasing. The fibrous structure of hide is formed by a complex matrix of collagen fibers that stabilizes through inter- and intra-molecular cross-links, which gives them physical properties. Shrinkage temperature (Ts), or denaturation, is one aspect of hydrothermal stability that is the response of leather to heat in the presence of water. Tanning process gives fiber higher stability which results on an increasing of the leather Ts. One of the advantages of chrome tanned leather is the high shrinkage temperature, typically above 100 ºC. Other tanning agents were used to develop new ways of finding alternative chromiumfree leather processes. Mineral tanning agents, as chromium, zirconium and silicates; vegetal tanning agents, as genipin, mimosa and quebracho; <b>syntans,</b> acrylic resin, gluteraldehyde and also different combinations of the previous agents were used. The hydrothermal stability of the leather samples was evaluated by measuring the Ts (through ISO 3380 and water bath) and by differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurements, allowing the study of enthalpy changes, which are associated with the denaturation of collagen. For a more detailed study a FTIR-ATR spectra analysis were performed to verify changes in the hide structure, resulting from tanning processes as well as of denaturation process. The results of this work showed that other tanning agents, with lower environmental impact, can be effective at increasing the thermal stability of leather.
