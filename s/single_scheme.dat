5|$|The code defines how {{sequences}} of nucleotide triplets, called codons, specify which amino acid {{will be added}} next during protein synthesis. With some exceptions, a three-nucleotide codon in a nucleic acid sequence specifies a single amino acid. The vast majority of genes are encoded with a <b>single</b> <b>scheme</b> (see the RNA codon table). That scheme {{is often referred to}} as the canonical or standard genetic code, or simply the genetic code, though variant codes (such as in human mitochondria) exist.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{camouflage}} {{is the use}} of camouflage {{on military}} aircraft to make them more difficult to see, whether on the ground or in the air. Given the possible backgrounds and lighting conditions, no <b>single</b> <b>scheme</b> works in every situation. A common approach has been a form of countershading, the aircraft being painted in a disruptive pattern of ground colors such as green and brown above, sky colors below. For faster and higher-flying aircraft, sky colors have sometimes been used all over, while helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft used close to the ground are often painted entirely in ground camouflage. Aircraft flying by night have often been painted black, but this actually made them appear darker than the night sky, leading to paler night camouflage schemes. There are trade-offs between camouflage and aircraft recognition markings, and between camouflage and weight. Accordingly, visible light camouflage has been dispensed with when air superiority was not threatened or when no significant aerial opposition was anticipated.|$|E

Several <b>single</b> <b>schemes</b> have been proposed and studied for location estimation, each with its own advantages and limitations. Furthermore, a number of hybrid schemes have been also proposed for the sake of generality and diversity of applications and the limitations of the <b>single</b> <b>schemes.</b> Some of the hybrid solutions combine measurements from more than a single technique to improve the estimation accuracy by employing data fusion. This paper presents a survey of single and fusion based hybrid location techniques...|$|R
