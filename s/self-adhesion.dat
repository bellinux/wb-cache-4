50|$|Some {{atmospheric}} {{effects on the}} functionality of adhesive devices can be characterized by following the theory of surface energy and interfacial tension. It is known that γ12 = (1/2)W121 = (1/2)W212. If γ12 is high, then each species finds it favorable to cohere while in contact with a foreign species, rather than dissociate and mix with the other. If this is true, then it follows that when the interfacial tension is high, the force of adhesion is weak, since each species does not find it favorable to bond to the other. The interfacial tension of a liquid and a solid {{is directly related to}} the liquids wettability (relative to the solid), and thus one can extrapolate that cohesion increases in non-wetting liquids and decreases in wetting liquids. One example that verifies this is polydimethyl siloxane rubber, which has a work of <b>self-adhesion</b> of 43.6 mJ/m2 in air, 74 mJ/m2 in water (a nonwetting liquid) and 6 mJ/m2 in methanol (a wetting liquid).|$|E

Based on sequence homology to the CD 155 gene, three poliovirus receptor-related genes (PRR 1, PRR 2, and PRR 3) were cloned recently.

The surface energies of PBA-UPy 4. 0 and PBA-UPy 7. 2 (with mole percentages of UPy 4. 0 % and 7. 2 %, respectively) {{are estimated to be}} 45 - 56 mJ m - 2 under dry condition by contact angle measurements using a three probe liquid method and also by contact and adhesion mechanics tests, as compared to the reported literature value of 31 - 34 mJ m - 2 for PBA, an increase that is attributed to the strong UPy-UPy H-bonding interactions. The adhesion strengths of PBA-UPy polymers depend on the UPy content, contact time, temperature and humidity level. Fractured PBA-UPy films can fully recover their <b>self-adhesion</b> strength to 40, 81, and 100 % in 10 s, 3 h, and 50 h, respectively, under almost zero external load.

40|$|In this thesis, the shear and <b>self-adhesion</b> nanomechanical {{properties}} between opposing cartilage aggrecan macromolecules were probed. In addition, nanoscale dynamic oscillatory {{mechanical properties}} of cartilage and its type II collagen network was measured. Aggrecan shear nanomechanics was assessed via microcontact printing and lateral force microscopy. Lateral force between aggrecan and the probe tip, and compression of aggrecan was simultaneously measured in 0. 001 - 1. 0 M NaCl aqueous solutions. Using the microsized tip (Rtip ~ 2. 5 [mu]m) enabled a large assembly of ~ 103 aggrecan molecules to interact simultaneously, closely mimicking the in vivo conditions. Both electrostatic and nonelectrostatic components were identified to importantly contribute to aggrecan shear. At near physiological IS (0. 1 M), significant rate dependence was observed, suggestive of visco/poroelastic interactions within the aggrecan layer. By using an aggrecan end-functionalized colloidal tip, shear of two opposing aggrecan layers was assessed {{in a similar}} fashion. Lower lateral force and a more marked rate dependence were measured compared to the shear of a single layer, due to the aggrecan inter-layer molecular interpenetration and the different local z-dependent charge density distribution. The addition of Ca 2 +, at physiological-like 2 mM concentration, significantly affects cartilage shear by its electrostatic screening and binding effects. Marked aggrecan <b>self-adhesion</b> upon separation was discovered after static compression {{in the presence of}} electrostatic repulsion in physiological-like conditions. (cont.) Aggrecan <b>self-adhesion</b> increases as increasing equilibration time and bath IS. Molecular origins of the adhesion, also present in vivo, include van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, Ca 2 +-mediated bridging, and molecular entanglements between the glycosaminogly-can branches of aggrecan. This <b>self-adhesion</b> could be an important factor in protecting cartilage matrix structural integrity and function via these energy-dissipative mechanisms. The nanoscale oscillatory dynamic deformation properties of both nontreated and proteoglycan(PG) -depleted (left mostly type II collagen) calf knee cartilage disks (- 0. 5 mm thick) was measured by connecting an external electronic wave generator to the AFM. A significant increase in effective stiffness E and phase lag A (deformation with respect to force) as increasing frequency for both disks suggests poro/viscoelasticity are more critical at higher frequency. The PG-depleted disk shows a more marked dependence of E and A on deformation amplitude - 2 - 100 nm, as the nanostructure and nanomechanical properties of porous collagen network are more heterogeneous without the entrapment of aggrecan motif. A unique - 23 nm banding pattern along the type II collagen fibrils was observed, which may be relative to the cartilage swelling properties and the molecular interaction between aggrecan and the collagen network. Taken together, this study provides insights into molecular-level deformation of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules (e. g., aggrecan, type II collagen) that are important to the understanding of cartilage biomechanical function. Ongoing studies are probing the age, disease (osteoarthritis), source and species related variations of cartilage ECM properties at the molecular level. by Lin Han. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Despite the glassy regime, the bulk plastic deformation triggered the requisite molecular mobility of the polymer chains, causing interpenetration across the interfaces held in contact. Quantitative levels of adhesion and the morphologies of the fractured interfaces validated the sub-Tg, plasticity-induced, molecular mobilization causing bonding.

Polydopamine-coated surfaces in air are relatively inert having a low <b>self-adhesion</b> compared with polydimethylsiloxane elastomer surfaces, reflecting the non-conformal, glassy nature of polydopamine thin films.

By varying the molecular mass Mc of PDMS from 6 to 28 kg/mol the elastic modulus E decreases from 1. 16 to 0. 71 MPa while the work of adhesion remains about constant. In contrast measurements of the friction of the same systems indicate an increase of the friction force. Introduction of dangling chains leads to a strong decrease of E from 1. 16 to 0. 56 MPa for low Mc and from 0. 71 to 0. 09 MPa for high Mc and again only to minor changes in W.

40|$|Materials for new {{applications}} are often created by combining existing polymers into blends or composites. However most polymer pairs {{tend to be}} immiscible leading to weak adhesion and poor mechanical properties, which can outweigh any advantages gained by blending. Adhesion and mechanical properties can be improved in such systems {{by the addition of}} small amounts of suitable block copolymer to the interface. Adhesion is promoted, firstly by a reduction in the interfacial tension, leading directly to an increase in the thermodynamic work of adhesion, and secondly by increasing the interfacial width, leading to more entanglements between polymer chains and hence greater mechanical reinforcement. In some cases, adhesion is further enhanced by covalent bonds between the block copolymer and the homopolymers. As progress towards nanoscale technology continues in many fields, including biomaterials and electronics, a detailed knowledge of the fundamental origins of adhesion promotion is becoming ever more vital in the design of new materials. The purpose of the research presented in this thesis was to examine several important molecular aspects of polymer-polymer adhesion promotion by block copolymers involving rubber-rubber and glass-rubber interfaces. The origins of <b>self-adhesion</b> hysteresis in polydimethylsiloxane elastomers were investigated using the JKR contact mechanics technique. Hysteresis was only observed in extracted elastomers and in <b>self-adhesion</b> experiments, suggesting its origins arose from surface interactions and not bulk viscoelasticity. The hysteresis increased with decreasing cross-linking density of the elastomers. When the platinum catalyst used to synthesize the PDMS elastomers was poisoned the hysteresis disappeared implying that a hydrosilylation reaction across the interface was responsible. The JKR method was also used to investigate the contributions to adhesion promotion by chain pull-out and covalent bonding using polydimethylsiloxane and polybutadiene elastomers in contact with silane terminated poly(styrene-b-dimethylsiloxane), poly(styrene-b-butadiene) and various functional surfaces. No evidence of adhesion enhancement caused by chain interpenetration was observed over a wide range of experimental and molecular parameters. Adhesion was only enhanced when reactions across the interface were possible. Further experiments involving end-tethered PDMS brushes showed that significant adhesion could be obtained but that this could be explained by the occurrence of various chemical reactions. ...|$|E

Cellulose is the most abundant chemical compound on earth and its nat-ural affinity for <b>self-adhesion</b> has long been recognized. The ease of adhesion that occurs in cellulose has contributed to its use in paper and other fiber-based composite materials. Cellulose adhesion, which has received considerable attention over the past half century, occurs over a practical length scale ranging from the nanoscale to millimeters. Adhesion theories that have been examined in the bonding of cellulose fibers include: mechanical interlocking, adsorption or wetting theory, diffusion theory, and the theory of weak boundary layers. Cellulose fibers on the nanoscale are prepared in four different ways: (1) bacterial cellu-lose nanofibers, (2) cellulose nanofibers by electrospinning, (3) microfibrillated cellulose plant cell fibers and (4) nanorods or cellulose whiskers. Structure and properties of nanocellulose that are important include: morphology, crystalline structure, surface properties, chemical and physical properties, and properties in liquid suspension.

For pre-crystallized samples, when the temperature of contact (Tcontact) was decreased below Tm, the fracture toughness, Gc decreased with Tcontact to vanish at a temperature corresponding to {{the onset of the}} fusion process. For quenched samples obtained in the amorphous state and put in contact before rising the temperature to Tcontact, Gc was very low for temperatures of contact well above Tg.

The study of adhesion between two commonly used soft elastomers PDMS (Sylgard 184) and Ecoflex 0300 are obtained with the measured pull-in and pull-off forces from a dynamical mechanical analyzer. The effect of base-polymer-to-curing-agent mixing ratio, i. e., crosslinking density, and solvent extraction are examined.

Although the effect of crosslinking density is not significant for pristine PDMS, it is very obvious that the higher <b>self-adhesion</b> can be found in less crosslinked PDMS after solvent extraction. Such an effect is even more drastic for PDMS-to-Ecoflex adhesion. An adhesion mechanism is proposed to explain these complex adhesion behaviors. It is concluded that the entanglement and interpenetration of tethered chains could enhance the pull-off work of adhesion, whereas those of free chains cannot.

We found a typical nonlinear sawtooth profile in the AFM force-versus-distance curves with a molecular persistence length of lp = 0. 31 ± 0. 04 nm. This is attributed to the stepwise dissociation of individual glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains in aggrecans, which is very similar to the known force fingerprints of other cell adhesion proteoglycan systems. After studying the GAG-GAG dissociation in a dynamic, loading-rate-dependent manner (dynamic SMFS) and analyzing the data according to the stochastic Bell-Evans model for a thermally activated decay of a metastable state under an external force, we estimated for the single glycan interaction a mean lifetime of τ = 7. 9  ± 4. 9 s and a reaction bond length of xβ = 0. 31 ± 0. 08 nm.

The scaffolds were evaluated after every 30 cycles, and the fixation strength was tested after the motion was completed. ResultsAll the SA scaffolds were detached before 60 cycles. The other scaffolds remained stable throughout the testing with only minor disruptions. The endpoint fixation strength was higher for BS and PC than for the FS scaffolds. The FS scaffolds were detached as a result of additional load cycles, while the BS and PC scaffolds showed substantial deformations. ConclusionSA of tested scaffold did not provide sufficient fixation. The FS fixation was easy to perform and assured satisfactory scaffold stability. BS and PC provided excellent scaffold stability, but the techniques were difficult and caused additional injuries. Regardless of the fixation technique used, the tested collagen scaffold may not be exposed to loading in the initial postoperative period...|$|E
40|$|Background: We {{recently}} reported that sphingomyelin (SM) analogs substituted on the alkyl chain by various fluorophores (e. g. BODIPY) readily inserted at trace levels into the plasma membrane of living erythrocytes or CHO cells and spontaneously concentrated into micrometric domains. Despite {{sharing the same}} fluorescent ceramide backbone, BODIPY-SM domains segregated from similar domains labelled by BODIPY-D-e-lactosylceramide (D-e-LacCer) and depended on endogenous SM. Methodology/Principal Findings. We show here that BODIPY-SM further differed from BODIPY-D-e-LacCer or -glucosylceramide (GlcCer) domains in temperature dependence, propensity to excimer formation, association with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored fluorescent protein reporter, and lateral diffusion by FRAP, thus demonstrating different lipid phases and boundaries. Whereas BODIPY-D-e-LacCer behaved like BODIPY-GlcCer, its artificial stereoisomer, BODIPY-L-t-LacCer, behaved like BODIPY- and NBD-phosphatidylcholine (PC). Surprisingly, these two PC analogs also formed micrometric patches yet preferably at low temperature, did not show excimer, never associated with the GPI reporter and showed major restriction to lateral diffusion when photobleached in large fields. This functional comparison supported a three-phase micrometric compartmentation, of decreasing order: BODIPY-GSLs > -SM > -PC (or artificial L-t-LacCer). Co-existence of three segregated compartments was further supported by double labelling experiments and was confirmed by additive occupancy, up to ~ 70 % cell surface coverage. Specific alterations of BODIPY-analogs domains by manipulation of corresponding endogenous sphingolipids suggested that distinct fluorescent lipid partition might reflect differential intrinsic propensity of endogenous membrane lipids to form large assemblies. Conclusions/Significance. We conclude that fluorescent membrane lipids spontaneously concentrate into distinct micrometric assemblies. We hypothesize that these might reflect preexisting compartmentation of endogenous PM lipids into non-overlapping domains of differential order: GSLs > SM > PC, resulting into differential <b>self-adhesion</b> of the two former, with exclusion of the latter...|$|E
40|$|Self-healing, a {{property}} of autonomically triggered recovery after damage, {{is one of}} the most outstanding properties observed in biological materials. Among various strategies for self-healing materials, intrinsic system which use inherent reversibility of physiological interactions or chemical bonds attracted most attention. Smart materials, which possess the property of rapid response to environmental changes, provide an approach to self-healing materials due to their biomimicking functions. Herein, this dissertation aims at design and synthesizing intrinsic self-healing protein hydrogels with different functionalities. Firstly, we present herein a strategy for construction of self-healing protein hydrogels with thermal method. Repeated self-healing events with about 100 % recovery extent was observed. However, external thermal requirement to trigger the self-healing mechanism in this system prevents its application in biomedical area. Then, a new class of protein hydrogel system was developed at room temperature under physiological pH based on cooperation of ion-mediated protein-protein interaction and bridging effect. Excellent self-healing properties of this hydrogel system were observed without external stimuli at room temperature under physiological pH, and this behavior can be promoted with the presence of divalent ions in physiological concentration. In addition, superior biocompatibility has been demonstrated by in vitrocytotoxicity analysis, suggesting potential biomedical application of this material in drug delivery, biological repair and tissue engineering. In order to improve healing efficiency and broaden the scope of applications of self-repairing protein hydrogels, a third system was brought. The protein hydrogels were fabricated by adjusting pH of the protein solutions. Rapid recovery as well as stronger healing capability were observed and quantitatively studied. In addition, this hydrogel exhibits <b>self-adhesion</b> and autofluorescence, which expand its application to where versatility of material is required under abrasive condition. Stimulus-responsive repairing to original state of mechanical properties in intrinsic self-healing protein hydrogels were demonstrated. The easy preparation and modification of the hydrogels opens an avenue in design of self-repairing materials with other desired functionalities...|$|E
40|$|Protein zero (P(o)) is the {{immunoglobulin}} gene superfamily glycoprotein that mediates the <b>self-adhesion</b> of the Schwann cell {{plasma membrane}} that yields compact myelin. HeLa is a poorly differentiated carcinoma cell line {{that has lost}} characteristic morphological features of the cervical epithelium from which it originated. Normally, HeLa cells are not self-adherent. However, when P(o) is artificially expressed in this line, cells rapidly aggregate, and P(o) concentrates specifically at cell-cell contact sites. Rows of desmosomes are generated at these interfaces, the plasma membrane localization of cingulin and ZO- 1, proteins that {{have been shown to}} be associated with tight junctions, is substantially increased, and cytokeratins coalesce into a cohesive intracellular network. Immunofluorescence patterns for the adherens junction proteins N-cadherin, alpha-catenin, and vinculin, and the desmosomal polypeptides desmoplakin, desmocollin, and desmoglein, are also markedly enhanced at the cell surface. Our data demonstrate that obligatory cell-cell adhesion, which in this case is initially brought about by the homophilic association of P(o) molecules across the intercellular cleft, triggers pronounced augmentation of the normally sluggish or sub-basal cell adhesion program in HeLa cells, culminating in suppression of the transformed state and reversion of the monolayer to an epithelioid phenotype. Furthermore, this response is apparently accompanied by an increase in mRNA and protein levels for desmoplakin and N-cadherin which are normally associated with epithelial junctions. Our conclusions are supported by analyses of ten proteins we examined immunochemically (P(o), cingulin, ZO- 1, desmoplakin, desmoglein, desmocollin, N-cadherin, alpha-catenin, vinculin, and cytokeratin- 18), and by quantitative polymerase chain reactions to measure relative amounts of desmoplakin and N-cadherin mRNAs. P(o) has no known signaling properties; the dramatic phenotypic changes we observed are highly likely to have developed in direct response to P(o) -induced cell adhesion. More generally, the ability of this "foreign" membrane adhesion protein to stimulate desmosome and adherens junction formation by augmenting well-studied cadherin-based adhesion mechanisms raises the possibility that perhaps any bona fide cell adhesion molecule, when functionally expressed, can engage common intracellular pathways and trigger reversion of a carcinoma to an epithelial-like phenotype...|$|E

The connectivity defects resulted from branching and invasion of WT stalk cells into mutant terminal cells. To determine the mechanisms that induce branching of WT stalk cells we mapped the mutations. We found that okg and cnj encode two vATPase subunits and dsj encodes an Archease. Terminal cells deficient for vATPase activity mis-localize apical proteins and stall apical membrane growth, which stimulates compensatory stalk cell hypertrophy and branching. While dsj, okg and cnj terminal cells shared terminal cell pruning defects were genetically downstream of the Target of Rapamycin (Tor) pathway, the compensatory branching of WT stalk cells adjacent to dsj terminal cell was independent of apical polarity. Additionally, we found that terminal cell injury induced adjacent stalk cell compensatory branching and stalk cells next to injured and genetically compromised terminal cells activate Jun Kinase and endoreplicate during invasion. Finally, inactivation of the Hippo growth pathway in stalk cells is sufficient to induce hypertrophy and branching. We conclude that genetically compromised or injured terminal cells activate hypertrophy and branching in a neighboring stalk cell. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. mAb-based {{approaches}} {{were used}} to identify cell surface components involved {{in the development and}} function of the frog olfactory system. We describe here a 205 -kD cell surface glycoprotein on olfactory receptor neurons that was detected with three mAbs: 9 -OE, 5 -OE, and 13 -OE. mAb 9 -OE immunoreactivity, unlike mAbs 5 -OE and 13 -OE, was restricted to only the axons and terminations of the primary sensory olfactory neurons in the frog nervous system. The 9 -OE polypeptide(s) were immunoprecipitated and tested for cross-reactivity with known neural cell surface components including HNK- 1, the cell adhesion molecule L 1, and the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM). These experiments revealed that p ERHAPS the most intriguing aspect of the developing nervous system is the formation of specific synaptic connections between neurons that are often considerable distances apart. The growth cones of pioneer neurons may be guided by cues in the form of chemotropicmolecules, adhesion or recognition molecules, and even inhibitory molecules in their microenvironment (Jessell, 1988). Considerable attention has been devoted to identifying the molecular basis of axonal guidance (Goodman et al., 1984; Dodd and Jessell, 1988). Two main classes of cell surface molecules have been proposed to be involved in this process in the vertebrate central nervous system. There are those molecules, represented by neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) ~ and N-cadherin, that are present on both cell bodies and axons of most neurons. Through both their temporal and spatial modulation, these molecules are probably involved in the histogenesis of many regions (Edelman, 1988; Matsunaga et al., 1988). The second class of molecules, whose distribution appears to be more limited to the surface of axons (e. g., L 1, contactin, FI 1, and G 4), appears to facilitate <b>self-adhesion</b> of fasciculating axons (Jessell, 1988). Recently, several new forms of N-CAM have been identiffed, raising the possibility that certain members of this family of molecules may be involved in more selective aspects of neural development than general cell-cell adhesio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Various {{members of}} the family of BTB/POZ zinc-finger {{transcription}} factors influence patterns of dendritic branching. One such member, Broad, is notable because its BrZ 3 isoform is widely expressed in Drosophila in immature neurons around the time of arbor outgrowth. We used the metamorphic remodeling of an identified sensory neuron, the dorsal bipolar dendrite sensory neuron (dbd), {{to examine the effects of}} BrZ 3 expression on the extent and pattern of dendrite growth during metamorphosis. Results Using live imaging of dbd in Drosophila pupae, we followed its normal development during metamorphosis and the effect of ectopic expression of BrZ 3 on this development. After migration of its cell body, dbd extends a growth-cone that grows between two muscle bands followed by branching and turning back on itself to form a compact dendritic bundle. The ectopic expression of the BrZ 3 isoform, using the GAL 4 /UAS system, caused dbd's dendritic tree to transform from its normal, compact, fasciculated form into a comb-like arbor that spread over on the body wall. Time-lapse analysis revealed that the expression of BrZ 3 caused the premature extension of the primary dendrite onto immature myoblasts, ectopic growth past the muscle target region, and subsequent elaboration onto the epidermis. To control the timing of expression of BrZ 3, we used a temperature-sensitive GAL 80 mutant. When BrZ 3 expression was delayed until after the extension of the primary dendrite, then a normal arbor was formed. By contrast, when BrZ 3 expression was confined to only the early outgrowth phase, then ectopic arbors were subsequently formed and maintained on the epidermis despite the subsequent absence of BrZ 3. Conclusions The adult arbor of dbd is a highly branched arbor whose branches self-fasciculate to form a compact dendritic bundle. The ectopic expression of BrZ 3 in this cell causes a premature extension of its growth-cone, resulting in dendrites that extend beyond their normal muscle substrate and onto the epidermis, where they form a comb-shaped, ectopic arbor. Our quantitative data suggest that new ectopic arbor represents an 'unpacking' of the normally fasciculated arbor onto the epidermis. These data suggest that the nature of their local environment can change dendrite behavior from <b>self-adhesion</b> to self-avoidance. </p...|$|E
40|$|Excessive {{nitrogen}} and phosphorus loading from municipal wastewater treatment plants is an ongoing threat to water quality, which leads to more stringent environmental regulations in different countries. Microalgal mediated twin-layer system offers an interesting alternative for {{nitrogen and}} phosphorus removal since it provides a treatment to remove both nutrients efficiently coupled with the production of potentially valuable biomass. In the twin-layer system, microalgae are immobilized by <b>self-adhesion</b> on a wet, microporous, ultrathin substrate (the substrate layer). Subtending the substrate layer, a second layer, consisting of a macroporous fibrous material (the source layer), provides the growth medium. Twin-layer effectively separate microalgae from {{the bulk of their}} growth medium, yet allow diffusion of nutrients. Nylon filter cloth and glass grid reinforced lamina were selected as the suitable substrate and source layer for twin-layer system, respectively. Immobilized green algae Scenedesmus rubescens and Chlamydomonas terricola showed highest biomass productivities among 23 algae supplied by synthetic secondary wastewater and were recommended for wastewater treatment in general. Removal of {{nitrogen and phosphorus}} from the real municipal wastewater by S. rubescens was investigated. During 54 days, S. rubescens grew well (1. 05 g dry weight m- 2 day- 1), remained immobilized and removed phosphorus, nitrate and ammonium efficiently from four types of wastewater within short retention time (1 - 2 days), e. g. the residual phosphate-P was < 0. 22 mg l- 1 and nitrate-N was < 2 mg l- 1 within one day in the secondary settled wastewater. Three scenarios were proposed on integrating twin-layer system into wastewater treatment plants. In one of the three, removing phosphorus and ammonium from 100 m 3 primary settled wastewater to meet the discharge requirement i. e. <= 1 mg l- 1 P will need a minimal ground area of greenhouse of about 1369 m 2 and 16. 6 kWh electricity daily. It is concluded that immobilization of S. rubescens on twin-layers is an effective means to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the wastewater. More efforts should be focus on the selection of microalgae and co-immobilization of microalgae with microalgae/other microorganisms to reduce organic substances...|$|E
40|$|Exposing the {{elastomer}} polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to {{oxygen plasma}} creates a very thin, stiff, and brittle surface-modified layer. Nano-scale crack patterns can {{be introduced to}} this layer with tensile stress. To optimize the pattern formation for a specific nano- or bio-technology research application, the surface-modified layer must be fully characterized. A characterization method was developed, {{using a combination of}} experiments and finite-element modeling. Phase imaging and nanoindentation with the atomic force microscope showed that the surface-modified layer was graded over approximately 200 nm, with an elastic modulus at the surface approximately ten-times that of the unmodified PDMS. Finite-element analyses indicated that the toughness of the surface-modified layer is extremely low (0. 1 – 0. 3 J/m 2) and that the embrittlement extends 100 – 400 nm below that of the measured layer thickness, signifying that the cracks may extend deeper than the apparent layer thickness. Variations of the nanocrack-patterning method were used to produce functional nanoscale patterns. First, surface-modified PDMS cubes and microspheres were uniaxially compressed causing their surfaces to be decorated with nanocrack patterns. Pattern formation, due to the distribution of tensile stresses in the surface-modified layer, on the cube surfaces was associated with friction at the contacts with the platens; whereas, for the microspheres it could exclusively be attributed to the changing cross-sectional area along the axis of compression. Second, an array of parallel tunnel cracks was produced in the surface-modified layer, when sandwiched between PDMS substrates, with an applied uniaxial tensile strain. The tunnel cracks functioned as tunable nanochannels when they connected pre-patterned microchannel reservoirs. Modulated fluidic transport of single particles between the reservoirs was demonstrated and electrical resistance measurements confirmed the nanochannel adjustability (from approximately 1 μm wide to completely closed). Due to the compliance of PDMS, surface forces were able to cause the channel and tunnel cracks to close, or heal, upon removal of applied tensile strain. The <b>self-adhesion</b> of the nanochannel walls due to surface forces was studied and the conditions for collapse were determined. A method for determining and applying a non-uniform traction on the surface of bodies that are interacting due to surface forces was developed...|$|E
