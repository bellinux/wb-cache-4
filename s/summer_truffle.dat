50|$|The flavor, {{size and}} color of <b>summer</b> <b>truffles</b> (tartufo estivo) {{is similar to that}} of {{burgundy}} truffles, but their aroma is less intense and the flesh (gleba) is a paler hazel color.|$|R
50|$|As {{their name}} suggests, <b>summer</b> <b>truffles</b> are {{harvested}} earlier than burgundy truffles, from May to August. They {{are most often}} found {{in the southern part}} of the distribution area of the species, notably in the Mediterranean climate areas of France, Italy and Spain.|$|R
40|$|In {{this review}} {{the current status}} of truffle {{cultivation}} in Europe and outside Europe is reported. While the cultivation of Tuber melanosporum (Périgord black <b>truffle),</b> Tuber aestivum (<b>summer</b> or Burgundy <b>truffle)</b> and Tuber borchii (bianchetto truffle) gave good results, only the Italian white truffle (Tuber magnatum), which is the most expensive, has yet to be successfully cultivated. In future a revolutionary approach to truffle cultivation would be the application of mycelial inoculation techniques for producing Tuber infected plants which will allow to select the fungal strains adapted to specific climatic, edaphic conditions and hosts. The new insights which will be gained by the extensive Tuber genome sequencing programme will also help to improve truffle cultivation techniques...|$|R
50|$|In cuisine and commerce, {{particularly}} in France and Italy, the <b>summer</b> <b>truffle</b> (T. aestivum) is {{distinguished from the}} burgundy truffle (T. uncinatum). However, molecular analysis showed in 2004 that these two varieties of truffle are one species. The differences between them are therefore likely due to environmental factors.|$|E
5000|$|Only nine genera of fungi are {{recognised}} in the book: Agaricus, Boletus, Hydnum, Phallus, Helvella, Peziza, Clavaria, Lycoperdon, and Mucor (listed on page 645); a tenth fungal genus, Tremella is covered, but {{included among}} his algae. Scottish Fungi note that [...] "While his classification {{might be a bit}} wonky by today's understanding, most of the species he recorded can be traced to modern taxa", and that he provided the first British records for the chanterelle and the <b>summer</b> <b>truffle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{black truffle}} is morphologically {{very similar to}} the commercially less {{valuable}} Chinese truffle (Tuber indicum). To avoid fraud or misidentifications in commerce, a RFLP genetic test has been developed to distinguish the two species. Externally, they can be distinguished by their skin, which is smoother and dark red or dark brown in the Chinese truffle. Two other similar truffle species are the <b>summer</b> <b>truffle</b> (Tuber aestivum) and the winter truffle (Tuber brumale), whose flesh is of a lighter color.|$|E
40|$|<b>Summer</b> <b>truffle</b> (Tuber aestivum Vittadini) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} mycorrhizal mushrooms with underground fruit bodies. Formerly the scientific investigations were focused mainly on its specific fragrant constituents. Our work was concentrated on complex chemical characterization including different organic and inorganic components. <b>Summer</b> <b>truffle</b> has middle crude protein, low fat-, and relatively high fiber and chitin contents; its energy level is low. Distribution of protein fractions is characteristic (in % of crude protein) : 40. 98; 5. 91; 3. 85; 19. 28 and 29. 98 % for albumins, globulins, prolamins, glutelins and NPN (non protein nitrogen), respectively. We determined soluble oligo- and polysaccharides (9. 00 mg/g DM and 49. 9 mg/g DM, respectively), as well as the contents of phenoloids and flavonoids (2. 8 mg/g DM and 0. 093 mg/g DM, respectively). Mineral composition is similar to other mushrooms; four macroelements (K, P, Ca and Mg) give 97. 94 % of the all mineral content; occurrence of poisonous elements (as As, Cd, V) is not characteristic. Chemical nature of Tuber aestivum (<b>summer</b> <b>truffle)</b> fruit bodies is very characteristic, regarding not only the occurrence of fragrant components but the classical, “usual ” components, too. This rare and highly appreciated hypogaeous mycorrhizal fungus belongs to mushrooms of valuable, specific chemical composition...|$|E

40|$|This article {{highlights}} {{historical data}} regarding truffles' occurrence in Poland. Along with the soil parameters the plant communities at the sites were studied. The {{results of the}} chemical soil analyses showed that the soil water pH at 5 sites was acidic (from 4. 3 to 6. 1), and only in one, Wiązowna, was the pH (7. 2) conductive to truffle development. Similarly, the content of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) in soil samples was low (from 0 to 0. 03 %), except for Wiązowna, where CaCO 3 was 0. 12 %. Among the 24 reported species of trees and shrubs, 7 species were host-plants of <b>summer</b> <b>truffle</b> (Tuber aestivum Vitt.). Out of these 7 species, oak and hornbeam were present at four locations. Across the sites, 31 species of ground-layer plants were identified. Among these, Epipactis helleborine was only one host-species of <b>summer</b> <b>truffle.</b> Our findings indicate that the formation of truffle fruiting-bodies depends on specific habitat characteristics. The key factors determining this process are soil parameters, such as: texture, pH and calcium content. Our inventory showed that the sites we studied still persist as natural stands, although {{only one of them}} seems to be favorable for truffle development: this site is located in Wiązowna, where soil is of pH 7. 2 and E. helleborine (host species for truffles from Orchidaceae) is found, fulfills the environmental requirements of trufflesPrzemysław Szmi...|$|E
40|$|Hungary has {{outstanding}} {{environment for}} natural truffle production {{in some regions}} including plain and hilly areas. The most famous of all the natural <b>summer</b> <b>truffle</b> (Tuber aestivum Vittad.) habitats is the commonly called Jászság region. This area is situated {{in the middle of}} Hungary, between river Danube and Tisza. The flatland area is basically covered by river alluviums with main soils of chernozems, fluvisols, solonchaks and arenosols. Climate of the region is typically continental: warm and dry summers and cold winters vary. The area is traditionally of agricultural use, although strong afforestation was made in the late 1950 ’s. The English oak (Quercus robur L.) populations planted at that time gave a basis for current excellent truffle production. Nowadays the region has proved to be the best natural <b>summer</b> <b>truffle</b> (T. aestivum) producing area of Hungary with early season opening (June) and high quality truffles as early as August. In the research the best truffle producing forest blocks were selected for ecological investigation. Results of the detailed site description showed uniform climate characteristics and dominance of English oak (Q. robur) or mixed English oak-Turkey oak (Quercus cerris L.) forests. Soil types revealed differences from earlier findings: dominance of gleysols and water affected chernozems was declared. Soil chemical parameters are in accordance with literature data: pH, organic matter and active carbonate content of the examined soils fall within the range indicated as the requirement of T. aestivum...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented here}} seeks {{to describe the}} impact of wild boar to a natural truffle ground of Tuber aestivum Vittad. on Monte Amiata (Tuscany – Italy). Pedoclimatic analyses indicated that the selected area could be considered suitable for the truffle production. Then classification of the vegetation of a Quercus cerris forest was carried out exploring {{the possibility of the}} BACI (Before-After-Control-Impact) sampling design. Finally 10 plots were selected, half of which have been fenced. For the first time the impact of wild boar was evaluated by estimating the surface area turned over by its activity. Moreover in each plot the number and weight of summer truffles was performed every 10 days during the fruiting period (June-November 2006 - 2008). The hypothesis that the presence of Sus scrofa has a strong negative influence on truffle harvesting has been amply confirmed by the data presented here, given the large increase of fruiting bodies of the <b>summer</b> <b>truffle</b> collected in the fenced plots. Consequently the destructive behaviour of the wild boar imply not only an ecological but also an economic damage in areas in which non-wood forest products are an important source of income...|$|E
40|$|The {{functioning}} of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbioses {{is closely related}} {{to the development of the}} soil mycelial phase the ECM fungi. The properties and spatiotemporal dynamics of such mycelia in ecosystems is, however, poorly understood. Here we show, using a soil colony of <b>summer</b> <b>truffle</b> (Tuber aestivum) as a model, that an ECM mycelium may only grow and colonize newly-opened soil patches when soil temperatures rise above certain threshold, in this case + 10 °C, provided other requirements such as sufficient soil moisture are fulfilled. Extension rates of truffle mycelium in the fields was recorded as > 0. 3 μm min− 1, several-fold greater than that predicted from laboratory cultures. Further, we demonstrated that there was a consistent spatial differentiation in mycelium growth patterns within the fungal colony on a decimeter scale, changing from “diffusion” type of growth at the colony margin to “colony-front” pattern further away from the colony margin. This change was clearly accompanied by shifting structure of soil microbial communities with Terrimonas sp. and another unidentified bacterium correlating with the “colony-front” mycelium growth pattern, and Sphingomonas sp. and Lysobacter brunnescens with the “diffusion” type of mycelium growth. Possible implications of the observed truffle colony differentiation are discussed for processes like fruit-body formation and dispersal of this ECM fungus. Our data indicate that the thallus of T. aestivum has to be considered as a principally variable (“mutabilis”) being in space and time, whose behavior correlates with conditions in ever changing soil environment (“in mutabili”) ...|$|E
