40|$|A {{method has}} been {{described}} for obtaining the density of air quickly without resort to measurement of the prevailing atmospheric conditions and with accuracy sufficient to enable the correction for the buoyancy of air on a weighing {{to be made to}} better than one part per million. The method involves the weighing in air in quick succession of two objects, a hollow cylinder of stainless steel (density 0. 5 g. /cm. (2 ̆ 73)) and a solid counterweight of equal mass and area {{in the form of a}} stainless steel tube (density 8. 11 g. /cm. (2 ̆ 73)). The densities of these objects have been obtained from the volume as determined by high-precision hydrostatic weighing and by measurements of the dimensions and from the mass as determined by weighing in an actual vacuum (2 ̆ 2 vacuum weighing bottle 2 ̆ 2). The density of air obtained by weighing this 2 ̆ 2 absolute density cylinder 2 ̆ 2 and counterweight has been compared to the density calculated from measurements of the atmosphere, made at the same time in a constant temperature room ((+OR-) 0. 075 (DEGREES)) and with high-precision instruments, of the barometric pressure and temperature and gravimetric determination of water and carbon dioxide contents. The density of air determined by the cylinder was 3. 4 parts per thousand greater than that calculated from the prevailing conditions. Possible explanations for the discrepancy have been examined with particular reference to the oxygen content of the atmosphere; the discrepancy is left unexplained but it is recommended that for the high-precision measurement of mass that the density of air be measured with a cylinder such as the one described;A method has been proposed for the high-precision determination of the oxygen content of the atmosphere;Modifications of the Mettler <b>single-pan</b> <b>balances</b> have been described to increase capacity and sensitivity and eliminate electrostatic effects;It has been proposed to replace the International Kilogram with a kilogram mass of a corrosion-resistant stainless steel the surface of which has been rendered nonpolar by chemical treatment and to subdivide the kilogram in an actual vacuum using a set of weights constructed on the basis of the Fibonacci sequence. Fabrication of such a set of weights has been started. A mathematical theory has been developed for the calibration of this set in which advantage is taken of the numerous possible cross checks on the experimental work afforded by the characteristics of the Fibonacci numbers...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to measure kidney weight and volume among living donors of both sexes in Brazil. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a cross-sectional survey carried out between December 2001 and August 2004. METHODS: Kidney transplantations from 219 living donors were analyzed for this study. The kidneys were weighed in grams on a <b>single-pan</b> digital <b>balance</b> just after drainage of the perfusion fluid and removal of the perirenal fat. The kidney volume was determined in milliliters by water displacement. RESULTS: The mean age at nephroureterectomy was 44 ± 9. 5. The donor organs came {{from the left side}} in 172 cases and from the right side in 47 cases. The weights and volumes of the right and left kidneys were, respectively, 169. 83 ± 29. 91 g and 157. 38 ± 31. 84 ml; and 173. 00 ± 33. 52 g and 160. 34 ± 34. 40 ml. The differences between the sides were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: According to the present study, kidney weight cannot be the only factor determining the side on which nephroureterectomy is performed, {{because of the lack of}} statistical significance between the two sides. On average, females donate lower nephron doses than males do, which could in some transplants result in allograft damage...|$|R
50|$|An {{analytical}} balance is {{a class of}} balance designed to measure small mass in the sub-milligram range. The measuring pan of an {{analytical balance}} (0.1 mg or better) is inside a transparent enclosure with doors so that dust does not collect and so any air currents in the room do not affect the balance's operation. This enclosure is often called a draft shield. The use of a mechanically vented balance safety enclosure, which has uniquely designed acrylic airfoils, allows a smooth turbulence-free airflow that prevents balance fluctuation and the measure of mass down to 1 μg without fluctuations or loss of product. Also, the sample must be at room temperature to prevent natural convection from forming air currents inside the enclosure from causing an error in reading. <b>Single-pan</b> mechanical substitution <b>balance</b> maintains consistent response throughout the useful capacity is achieved by maintaining a constant load on the balance beam, thus the fulcrum, by subtracting mass {{on the same side}} of the beam to which the sample is added.|$|R
