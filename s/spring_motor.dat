No doubt also it is pleasant to contemplate the possibility of traversing space like a bird, a meteor, or a comet, and the absolute impossibility of [...] "getting off the rails;" [...] but what, we would ask, would be the result of a hitch--ever so small--in the working of the steam-engine or of the <b>spring</b> <b>motor?</b> ...|$|E

50|$|Some motors are {{powered by}} {{potential}} or kinetic energy, for example some funiculars, gravity plane and ropeway conveyors {{have used the}} energy from moving water or rocks, and some clocks have a weight that falls under gravity. Other forms of potential energy include compressed gases (such as pneumatic <b>motors),</b> <b>springs</b> (clockwork <b>motors)</b> and elastic bands.|$|R

50|$|The rotary shutter and {{the film}} drive are like those used in cine cameras. When the shutter release is pressed, a light-blocking shield lifts and the shutter disc rotates a full turn exposing the film through its open sector; when the {{pressure}} is released the light-blocking shield returns to its position behind the lens, and the <b>spring</b> <b>motor</b> advances the film and recocks the shutter. This is almost instantaneous. With practice a photographer could take 4 or 5 pictures a second. Each winding of the <b>spring</b> <b>motor</b> was good for about 25 pictures, half a roll of film. Shutter speed was determined by spring tension and mechanical delay since the exposure sector was fixed. The Robot I had an exposure range of 1 to 1/500, and provision for time exposures.|$|E
5000|$|The {{motorized}} amateur cameras {{powered by}} clockwork (<b>spring)</b> <b>motors</b> were first made in 1934, {{and ended with}} a special limited edition collector's model, [...] "Star Classic", in 1996. The Robot film cameras used 35 mm film, mostly in square 24 × 24 mm image format, but many used 18 × 24 mm (half-frame) and 24 × 36 mm (standard Leica format), and non-standard formats such as 6 × 24 mm (Recorder 6), 12 × 24 mm (Recorder 12) and 16 × 16 mm (Robot SC).|$|R

5000|$|Otto Berning {{was granted}} its first Robot patent in 1934; a US patent was granted in 1936. The camera was {{originally}} intended to come in two versions: Robot I, without motor, and Robot II with a <b>spring</b> <b>motor.</b> Its release was delayed and already the first camera [...] "Robot I" [...] included its hallmark <b>spring</b> <b>motor.</b> The first production cameras had a stainless steel body, a spring drive that could shoot 4 frames per second, and a rotary shutter with speeds from 1 to 1/500th second. The camera used proprietary [...] "Type K" [...] cartridges, not the now-standard 35 mm cartridges introduced {{in the same year}} by Kodak's Dr. August Nagel Kamerawerk for the Retina. The camera does not have a rangefinder, as it was designed for use mostly with short focal length lenses (e.g. 40 mm) with great depth of field.|$|E
50|$|Beaulieu {{established}} {{a reputation for}} producing high quality movie cameras for the advanced amateur in 8mm, 9.5mm and 16mm. Reflex viewfinders were introduced before these became common.

In 1965 the R16 Electric, an electric motor version of the R16 was introduced.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{electric}} starter motor {{was to come}} to dominate the car market, in 1912 there were several competing types of starter, with the Adams, S.C.A.T. and Wolseley cars having direct air starters, and Sunbeam introducing an air starter motor with similar approach to that used for the Delco and Scott-Crossley electrical starter motors (i.e. engaging with a toothed ring on the flywheel). The Star and Adler cars had <b>spring</b> <b>motors</b> (sometimes referred to as clockwork motors), which used the energy stored in a spring driving through a reduction gear. If the car failed to start the starter handle {{could be used to}} wind up the spring for a further attempt.|$|R

50|$|The Stafford Mineral Springs and Stafford's Wells Hotel are {{the site}} of a {{historic}} mineral springs hotel resort property in Montgomery County, Mississippi. The property was built in 1890 by Dr. Thomas Washborn and was visited for its supposed curative properties. The property was then developed by Edward Stafford and his partners, who formed Stafford Mineral Springs Company, Limited, and incorporated in Louisiana on May 19, 1892. Prior to 1916 it had well houses, bath houses, guest cottages, a dance pavilion, and gambling hall. Later the Stafford <b>Springs</b> <b>Motor</b> Lodge was developed in the area.

50|$|At first, like {{nearly all}} other early record players, all Grafonolas were {{driven by a}} <b>spring</b> <b>motor</b> that the user had to {{wind up with a}} crank before playing a record or two. In 1915, Columbia began to {{introduce}} electric-motor-driven models, as a majority of urban areas had been wired to electrical grids. The electrified Grafonolas supported both alternating and direct currents from 110 to 220 volts. Electrified Grafonolas never gained the popularity enjoyed by the spring-motor-driven versions due to substantially higher prices and lack of electrical service in rural areas.|$|E
50|$|The {{car came}} from a {{business}} called Brun, Dolo & Galtier (BDG) located at Pierrefitte. Messrs Brun, Dolo and Galtier were hitherto unknown in motor industry circles, but the car looked modern and affordable {{when compared to the}} offerings provided by the known auto-makers. The prototype had its first outing at the 1947 Salon de Paris (primarily an art fair) and six months later appeared at the Paris Motor Show in October 1947. The next year it turned up at the <b>Spring</b> <b>Motor</b> Shows at Geneva and Brussels.|$|E
5000|$|Until the mid-1920s {{records were}} played on purely {{mechanical}} record players usually {{powered by a}} wind-up <b>spring</b> <b>motor.</b> The sound was [...] "amplified" [...] by an external or internal horn that was coupled to the diaphragm and stylus, {{although there was no}} real amplification: the horn simply improved the efficiency with which the diaphragm's vibrations were transmitted into the open air. The recording process was in essence the same non-electronic setup operating in reverse, but with a recording stylus engraving a groove into a soft waxy master disc and carried slowly inward across it by a feed mechanism.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{covers the}} {{phenomenon}} of decarbonation of {{the surface of the}} diaphragm <b>springs</b> for <b>motor</b> vehicles clutches. In certain conditions, it is possible that one part of the carbon leaves the metal surface and, therefore, its mechanical characteristics will deteriorate. Thus, the thickness of the cross-section of the core is reduced, which has a direct impact on the level of strain and the durability of diaphragm spring,. An analytical and experimental approach is presented in this paper, in order to analyze the impact of decarbonated layer upon the level of strain and durability of diaphragm <b>springs</b> for <b>motor</b> vehicles’ clutches.

50|$|The Kodak Cine Special 16mm Cameras (CKS) were {{a family}} of precision, versatile, spring-wound 16mm silent movie cameras {{produced}} Eastman Kodak from the 1930s to 1960’s, and intended for advanced consumers and industry professionals. While its rectangular format was typical of earlier Kodak 16 mm cameras (such as Cine-Kodak, Kodak Models B, F and K), the CKS 'box' was formed by two joined sections: the <b>spring</b> <b>motor</b> half with the user controls, winding cranks, and gear work to the shutter. The other half was a film magazine which docked to the motor. This allowed the cinematographer to pre-load multiple magazines of film for quick interchange of film.|$|E

50|$|Pull and tilt cords are {{dangerous}} {{to young children}} and pets, as they may cause strangulation. Over 200 children have strangled on pull and tilt cords of horizontal blinds. Cord retrofit kits include cord stops, tassels and tie down devices which are used to upgrade the blind but is not considered the safest alternative according to the US.CPSC, who recommends using only cordless window coverings in homes where small children live or visit. Blinds with wand tilt are safer than blinds with traditional cord tilt. There are also cordless blinds. The dangling group of pull cords {{is replaced by a}} <b>spring</b> <b>motor</b> system.
