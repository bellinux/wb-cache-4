We report here that <b>sperm</b> <b>cells</b> from MHC class II knockout mice have a reduced ability to bind DNA compared to <b>sperm</b> <b>cells</b> from wild-type animals. Spermatozoa from CD 4 knockout mice are instead fully capable of binding exogenous DNA, yet lose the ability to further internalize it.

Moreover, we show that nuclear internalization of exogenous DNA was prevented in wild-type <b>sperm</b> <b>cells</b> preincubated with anti-CD 4 mAbs. These results support the conclusion that CD 4 and MHC class II molecules play distinct roles {{in the process of}} sperm/DNA interaction: though not present in mature <b>sperm</b> <b>cells,</b> MHC class II expression appears to be required during spermatogenesis to produce <b>sperm</b> <b>cells</b> capable of taking up foreign DNA, while CD 4 molecules present on <b>sperm</b> <b>cells</b> mediate the nuclear internalization of sperm-bound DNA...|$|R

Incubation of the <b>sperm</b> <b>cells</b> in the presence of MTT resulted after a few min in a diffuse staining of the midpiece of the <b>sperm</b> <b>cells.</b> Upon further incubation the staining of the midpiece became more intense, and gradually the formation of packed formazan granules became more visible. At the same time, a small formazan stained granule appeared medially on the sperm head, which increased in size during further incubation. After incubation for about 1 h the midpiece granules were intensely stained and more clearly distinct as granules, while aggregation of <b>sperm</b> <b>cells</b> occurred. Around 90 % of the <b>sperm</b> <b>cells</b> showed these staining events. At the end of the staining the formazan granules have disappeared from both the <b>sperm</b> <b>cells</b> and medium, whereas formazan crystals appeared as thin crystal threads, that became heavily aggregated in the incubation medium.

25|$|A form of asexual {{reproduction}} related to parthenogenesis is gynogenesis. Here, offspring {{are produced by}} the same mechanism as in parthenogenesis, but with the requirement that the egg merely be stimulated {{by the presence of}} sperm in order to develop. However, the <b>sperm</b> <b>cell</b> does not contribute any genetic material to the offspring. Since gynogenetic species are all female, activation of their eggs requires mating with males of a closely related species for the needed stimulus. Some salamanders of the genus Ambystoma are gynogenetic and appear to have been so for over a million years. It is believed that the success of those salamanders may be due to rare fertilization of eggs by males, introducing new material to the gene pool, which may result from perhaps only one mating out of a million.

Sperm production, on the other hand, was strongly predicted by parasite intensities only and these associations were mainly positive.
