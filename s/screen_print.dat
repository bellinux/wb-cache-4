2500|$|Areas {{that should}} not be {{soldered}} may be covered with solder resist (solder mask). One of the most common solder resists used today is called [...] "LPI" [...] (liquid photoimageable solder mask). A photo-sensitive coating is applied {{to the surface of the}} PWB, then exposed to light through the solder mask image film, and finally developed where the unexposed areas are washed away. [...] Dry film solder mask is similar to the dry film used to image the PWB for plating or etching. [...] After being laminated to the PWB surface it is imaged and develop as LPI.

The legend [...] "Consular Corps" [...] appears at the top, while the legend [...] "Victoria" [...] appears at the bottom. As of 20 February 2016, the design was replaced with navy blue background, reflective white with VIC embossed vertically at left hand side, reflective white bottom legend Consular Corps in <b>screen</b> <b>print</b> and Consular Corp Melbourne gold logo in the middle between CC and the three-digit number.

40|$|For this research, {{the image}} quality {{attributes}} of offset <b>printing</b> versus <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> methods for providing high-resolution premium products, such as plastic key chains, were investigated. The three substrates investigated were Polypropylene (PP), Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and Polyester (PET). Optical properties, such as dot gain, solid ink density, ink trapping, tone reproduction and print contrast, were analyzed through color measurement and visual evaluation. In addition, the end-use applications were tested using adhesion tests, water resistance tests, and heat resistance tests {{to make certain}} that the final product achieve the best quality print and meets end-use requirements. The results of this research showed that offset printing can be used in place of <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> to produce premium products. According to the research results, solid ink density, ink trapping, and <b>print</b> contrast on <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sheets show better results than offset printed sheets. However, the <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sheets had lower dot gain results than the offset printed sheets. Although the <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sheets appeared to give better optical properties than the offset printed sheet, the tone reproduction curves showed that the offset printed sheet had better visual image quality than the <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sheet. The results of the survey, which asked candidates to compare two images (<b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sheet vs. offset printed sheet), showed {{that the majority of the}} people chose the offset printed sheet more often than the <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sheet. This also supports the results of the tone reproduction curves which show that the offset printed sheet produced a higher image quality than the <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sheet. The results of the application tests determined that the offset printed sheet withstood all three tests while the <b>screen</b> <b>printed</b> sheet failed the water resistance tests and the adhesion tests...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{integration}} of blind people into society, suitable conditions should be provided for them. The expansion of Braille (BR) use could serve the purpose. Depending on the materials used for Braille, it can be formed or printed in different ways: embossing, <b>screen</b> <b>printing,</b> thermoforming, digital printing. The aim {{of this research is}} to determine the effect of thermal properties of <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> inks and inks with thermo-powder on the qualitative parameters of Braille. <b>Screen</b> <b>printing</b> inks and inks with thermo-powder were chosen for the research. Carrying out the qualitative analysis of printouts with Braille, the thermal stability was evaluated by analyzing the thermograms obtained with derivatograph Q- 1500. This paper presents the findings of the thermogravimetric (TG), differential thermogravimetric (DTG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) of printouts printed on paperboard Plike and using traditional <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> inks and <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> inks with thermo-powder. Based on the testing findings it is determined that thermal stability of printouts printed with thermo-powder ink is higher than <b>printed</b> with <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> inks. It is determined that the appropriate temperature range of <b>screen</b> <b>printing</b> inks with thermo-powder drying is 98 ºC – 198 ºC because in this case better relief of Braille dots is obtained.
