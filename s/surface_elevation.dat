5|$|Newton (test plate) {{interferometry}} {{is frequently}} {{used in the}} optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured. Fig.13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats {{at different stages of}} completion, showing the different patterns of interference fringes. The reference flats are resting with their bottom surfaces in contact with the test flats, and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source. The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands. The surface in the left photo is nearly flat, indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal intervals. The surface in the right photo is uneven, resulting in a pattern of curved fringes. Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in <b>surface</b> <b>elevation</b> of half a wavelength of the light used, so differences in elevation can be measured by counting the fringes. The flatness of the surfaces can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method. To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat, any of several procedures may be adopted. One can observe how the fringes are displaced when one presses gently on the top flat. If one observes the fringes in white light, the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation. Finally one may compare the appearance of the fringes as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position. These sorts of maneuvers, while common in the optical shop, are not suitable in a formal testing environment. When the flats are ready for sale, they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification.|$|E

Ice-rafted debris is deposited when the iceberg strands on the shore and subsequently melts, or drops out of the ice floe as it melts. Hence all erratic deposits are deposited below the actual high water level of the lake; however the measured altitude of ice-rafted debris can be used to estimate the lake <b>surface</b> <b>elevation.</b>|$|E

25|$|Concrete {{placement}} started {{around the}} clock on June 17, 1960. The last bucket of concrete was poured on September 13, 1963. Over 5 million cubic yards (4,000,000 m³) of concrete make up Glen Canyon Dam. The Dam is 710 feet (216 m) high, with the <b>surface</b> <b>elevation</b> of the water at full pool being approximately 3700 feet (1100 m). Construction of the Dam cost $155 million, and 18 lives {{were lost in the}} process. From 1970 to 1980, turbines and generators were installed for hydroelectricity. On September 22, 1966, Glen Canyon Dam was dedicated by Lady Bird Johnson.|$|E
25|$|Stokes' wave {{theory is}} of direct {{practical}} use for waves on intermediate and deep water. It {{is used in}} the design of coastal and offshore structures, {{in order to determine the}} wave kinematics (free <b>surface</b> <b>elevation</b> and flow velocities). The wave kinematics are subsequently needed in the design process to determine the wave loads on a structure. For long waves (as compared to depth) – and using only a few terms in the Stokes expansion – its applicability is limited to waves of small amplitude. In such shallow water, a cnoidal wave theory often provides better periodic-wave approximations.|$|E

In high-resolution images (<19 m/pixel), the surface of Hesperia Planum is dominated by dust and fine-grained deposits. Few boulders or bedrock outcrops are visible. Abundant, shallow craters filled with smooth, flat-lying deposits are common. No vents or volcanic constructs are identifiable, although small (<10s meters wide) channels are present.|$|E
40|$|The NASA and ESA retracking {{algorithms}} {{are compared}} with an algorithm based upon a combined surface and volume (S/V) scattering model. First, the S/V, NASA, and ESA algorithms were used to retrack over 400, 000 altimeter return waveforms from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The <b>surface</b> <b>elevations</b> from the S/V algorithm were compared with the elevations produced by the NASA and ESA algorithms to determine the relative accuracy of these algorithms when subsurface volume-scattering occurs. The {{results show that the}} NASA algorithm produced <b>surface</b> <b>elevations</b> within 35 to 50 cm of the S/V algorithm, while the performance of the ESA algorithm was slightly worse. Next, by analyzing several thousand satellite crossover points from the Antarctic data set, we determined the retracking algorithm that produced the most repeatable <b>surface</b> <b>elevations.</b> The elevations derived from the S/V algorithm had the smallest RMS error for the region of the East Antarctic plateau examined here. The ESA algorithm produced erroneous estimates of elevation change when seasonal variations were present; it measured 0. 7 to 1. 6 -m change in elevation over a 6 -month period on the East Antarctic plateau where accumulation rates are only 10 cm/year...|$|R
40|$|Soil surface {{roughness}} {{is a dynamic}} property which determines, to a large extent, erosion and infiltration rates. Although soils containing rock fragments are widespread in the Mediterranean region, {{the effect of the}} latter on {{surface roughness}} evolution is yet poorly understood. Therefore, laboratory experiments were conducted in order to investigate the effect of rock fragment content, rock fragment size and initial moisture content of the fine earth on the evolution of interrill surface roughness during simulated rainfall. <b>Surface</b> <b>elevations</b> of simulated plough layers along transects of 50 cm length were measured before and after simulated rainfall (totalling 192. 5 mm, I = 70 mm h(- 1)) with a laser microreliefmeter. The results were used to investigate whether systematic variations in interrill surface roughness along stony hillslopes in southeastern Spain could be attributed to rock fragment cover and rock fragment size. Soil <b>surface</b> <b>elevations</b> were measured along the contour lines (50 cm long transects) with a contact microreliefmeter. Roughness was expressed by two parameters related to the height and frequency of roughness elements, respectively: standard deviation of de-trended <b>surface</b> <b>elevations</b> (random roughness: RR), and correlation length (L) derived from exponential fits of the autocorrelation functions. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Stokes' second {{definition}} of wave celerity {{is for a}} frame of reference where the mean horizontal mass transport of the wave motion equal to zero. This {{is different from the}} first definition due to the mass transport in the splash zone, i.e. between the trough and crest level, in the wave propagation direction. This wave-induced mass transport is caused by the positive correlation between <b>surface</b> <b>elevation</b> and horizontal velocity. In the reference frame for Stokes' second definition, the wave-induced mass transport is compensated by an opposing undertow (so ŪE<nbsp&0 for waves propagating in the positive x-direction). This is the logical definition for waves generated in a wave flume in the laboratory, or waves moving perpendicular towards a beach.|$|E
25|$|Underneath the surface, {{there is}} a fluid motion {{associated}} with the free surface motion. While the <b>surface</b> <b>elevation</b> shows a propagating wave, the fluid particles are in an orbital motion. Within the framework of Airy wave theory, the orbits are closed curves: circles in deep water, and ellipses in finite depth—with the ellipses becoming flatter {{near the bottom of}} the fluid layer. So while the wave propagates, the fluid particles just orbit (oscillate) around their average position. With the propagating wave motion, the fluid particles transfer energy in the wave propagation direction, without having a mean velocity. The diameter of the orbits reduces with depth below the free surface. In deep water, the orbit's diameter is reduced to 4% of its free-surface value at a depth of half a wavelength.|$|E
25|$|Floodgates, {{also called}} stop gates, are {{adjustable}} gates {{used to control}} water flow in flood barriers, reservoir, river, stream, or levee systems. They may be designed to set spillway crest heights in dams, to adjust flow rates in sluices and canals, {{or they may be}} designed to stop water flow entirely as part of a levee or storm surge system. Since most of these devices operate by controlling the water <b>surface</b> <b>elevation</b> being stored or routed, they are also known as crest gates. In the case of flood bypass systems, floodgates sometimes are also used to lower the water levels in a main river or canal channels by allowing more water to flow into a flood bypass or detention basin when the main river or canal is approaching a flood stage.|$|E

The sensitivity is used to approach measured water <b>surface</b> <b>elevations</b> from the field with calculated water <b>surface</b> <b>elevations</b> using the HEC-RAS program. To analyze the Manning coefficient (n), a simple rectangle cross section is used to model a steady flow. This is intended to simplify a sample problem in predicting an more accurate Manning coefficient. This is as a procedure to get the best flow model. The Manning coefficient produced using calibrating procedure can be used to get the best steady flow model.

40|$|Accelerometers, {{which can}} be {{installed}} inside a floating platform on the sea, {{are among the most}} commonly used sensors for operational ocean wave measurements. To examine the non-stationary features of ocean waves, this study was conducted to derive a wavelet spectrum of ocean waves and to synthesize sea <b>surface</b> <b>elevations</b> from vertical acceleration signals of a wave buoy through the continuous wavelet transform theory. The short-time wave features can be revealed by simultaneously examining the wavelet spectrum and the synthetic sea <b>surface</b> <b>elevations.</b> The in situ wave signals were applied to verify the practicality of the wavelet-based algorithm. We confirm that the spectral leakage and the noise at very-low-frequency bins influenced the accuracies of the estimated wavelet spectrum and the synthetic sea <b>surface</b> <b>elevations.</b> The appropriate thresholds of these two factors were explored. To study the short-time wave features from the wave records, the acceleration signals recorded from an accelerometer inside a discus wave buoy are analysed. The results from the wavelet spectrum show the evidence of short-time nonlinear wave events. Our study also reveals that more surface profiles with higher vertical asymmetry can be found from short-time nonlinear wave with stronger harmonic spectral peak. Finally, we conclude that the algorithms of continuous wavelet transform are practical for revealing the short-time wave features of the buoy acceleration signals...|$|R
