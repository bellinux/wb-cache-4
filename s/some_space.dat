This episode was written to {{accomplish}} that, and to allow the writers <b>some</b> <b>space</b> to create other episodes they had in mind. Co-writer Glen Morgan claims the episode {{was inspired by the}} movie The Entity. The name Tom Braidwood, the show's assistant director who later played Lone Gunmen member Melvin Frohike, is used in the scene where the parking lot attendant paints over the name of Howard Graves. The episode featured guest appearances by Barry Primus, Lisa Waltz, Lorena Gale and Veena Sood.|$|E

5|$|To fit {{the program}} into the 320 words {{available}} on the chip, some significant modification was used. By not using regular floating point numbers, which require lots of instructions to keep the decimal point in the right place, <b>some</b> <b>space</b> was freed up. Trigonometric functions were implemented in about 40 instructions, and inverse trigonometric functions are almost 30 more instructions. Logarithms are about 40 instructions, with anti-log about 20 on top of that. The code to normalize and display the computed values are roughly the same in both the TI and Sinclair programs.|$|E
5|$|Data {{processing}} {{begins with}} indexing the reflections. This means identifying {{the dimensions of}} the unit cell and which image peak corresponds to which position in reciprocal space. A byproduct of indexing is to determine the symmetry of the crystal, i.e., its space group. <b>Some</b> <b>space</b> groups can be eliminated from the beginning. For example, reflection symmetries cannot be observed in chiral molecules; thus, only 65 space groups of 230 possible are allowed for protein molecules which are almost always chiral. Indexing is generally accomplished using an autoindexing routine. Having assigned symmetry, the data is then integrated. This converts the hundreds of images containing the thousands of reflections into a single file, consisting of (at the very least) records of the Miller index of each reflection, and an intensity for each reflection (at this state the file often also includes error estimates and measures of partiality (what part of a given reflection was recorded on that image)).|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>space</b> opera {{doctrines of}} Scientology are only {{provided}} by the church to experienced members, who church leaders maintain {{are the only ones}} able to correctly understand them. Several former members of the church have exposed these secret documents, leading to lengthy court battles with the church, which failed to keep the secret. Critics of the church have noted that some of the narratives are scientifically impossible, and have thus assailed the church as untrustworthy for teaching them. The space opera teachings have also been satirized in popular culture. Scholars of religion have described the space opera narratives as a creation myth designed to encourage reverence of Hubbard as a supreme messenger. Several academics have drawn attention to the similarity of the space opera myths to themes of the 1950s Cold War culture in which they were constructed.|$|E

By this time, most of the high-end retailers had moved out of Trump Tower, having been replaced with more upper-middle-class outlets such as Coach and Dooney & Bourke. The Niketown store still remained in the tower as of the 2016 election with a lease in that location until 2022. Nike also leased <b>some</b> <b>space</b> at 6 East 57th Street next to the tower, but in November 2016, it signed a $700 million contract for a new retail space a few blocks south, having intended {{to move out of}} 6 East 57th since 2013. During and after the election, there were petitions to relocate the Niketown store, created by advocacy organizations who opposed Trump's election.|$|E

She tries to dump {{him but he}} is knocked unconscious and forgets what she told him. After a while he remembers and their relationship ends. While seeing Geoff, Ruby starts to feel unwell and is diagnosed with diabetes. She later organises a rally to stop a number of refugees being deported, but the event is fire bombed by racists. After this event Geoff blames Ruby and leaves her and Summer Bay. She briefly reunites with Xavier but Mink Carpenter (Matylda Buczko) ruins it. Ruby later enlists Liam to become her music tutor. They form a strong friendship but Ruby starts to have feeling for him. Nicole Franklin (Tessa James) tells Liam, he agrees to keep tutoring her and tells her where they stand. Although Liam tells her {{they will not be}} together, she lets her feelings develop into love for Liam and tries to kiss him. He tells her again that it is wrong and decides to put <b>some</b> <b>space</b> between them. Ruby kisses Casey, but she later reveals she really wants to be with Romeo. She has sex with Romeo, but is devastated when he rejects her. She tells Charlie that she wants to hurt Romeo like he hurt her and tells Indigo about their one-night stand. Ruby then begins a relationship with Casey. She is devastated when Charlie dies, after being shot. Ruby blames Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke) for her mother's death and she pushes Casey away and their relationship ends.|$|E

T. to get information on Beauty of Nature's deal with a Japanese department store, he lets Ashley in on his and her brother Jack's (Peter Bergman) plans to obtain Beauty of Nature. Ashley and Tucker go to Japan and discover Victor's daughter, Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), bribing the Japanese Minister of Zoning with an antique gun. They commiserate over how their mother's abandoned them and make love for the first time. However, Ashley still {{wants to be with}} Neil and Tucker decides to give her <b>some</b> <b>space.</b> When Neil breaks up with Ashley, Tucker tries to cheer her up. With help from Jill, Tucker and Ashley confront Victor about Victoria bribing the Japanese official with the antique gun. However, Ashley decides against turning Victor into the feds to protect the company and her daughter, and Tucker agrees to obtain Beauty of Nature another way. Tucker supports Ashley when she must testify against Adam and helps Ashley get past her insecurities about their relationship as well her ability to work as CEO. Tucker goes ahead with his plan, and makes Jack co-CEO despite their plans for BON being stalled and they discuss using Abby to get to Victor. Despite being rejected by her family, Tucker supports Katherine when her great-grandson Chance Chancellor (John Driscoll) is presumed dead. Meanwhile, Katherine warns Tucker that she will back Victor in Abby's lawsuit and Abby becomes suspicious of Tucker when she sees him comforting Jill due Katherine cutting both of them out when her husband, Murphy (Michael Fairman), is hospitalized. Tucker is about to hire Diane Jenkins (Maura West) and they end up sleeping together; however he changes his mind when he learns that Diane lied about her previous job. Victoria reveals that she is pursuing Beauty of Nature in the lawsuit and she promises to sell it to him, on the condition that she is the CEO of the newly merged cosmetics company. Tucker buys Abby a horse for her birthday, her parents disapprove and he and Ashley get engaged on Christmas Eve.|$|E
