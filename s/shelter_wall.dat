2500|$|There are {{numerous}} caves in the easily eroded sandstone of Clarens Formation, the layer below the thick, hard basalt layer on the KwaZulu Natal-Lesotho border. Many of these caves have rock paintings by the San (Bushmen). This {{portion of the}} Drakensberg has between 35,000 and 40,000 works of San rock art and is the largest collection of such work in the world. Some 20,000 individual rock paintings have been recorded at 500 different caves and overhanging sites between the Drakensberg Royal Natal National Park and Bushman's Nek. Due to the materials used in their production, these paintings are difficult to date but there is anthropological evidence, including many hunting implements, that the San people existed in the Drakensberg at least 40,000 years ago, and possibly over 100,000 years ago. According to , [...] "n Nd edema Gorge in the Central Ginsberg 3,900 paintings have been recorded at 17 sites. One of them, Sebaayeni Cave, contains 1,146 individual paintings."

60|$|At {{the end of}} {{the slope}} he fell a {{thousand}} feet, and came down {{in the midst of a}} cloud of snow upon a snow slope even steeper than the one above. Down this he was whirled, stunned and insensible, but without a bone broken in his body; and then at last came to gentler slopes, and at last rolled out and lay still, buried amidst a softening heap of the white masses that had accompanied and saved him. He came to himself with a dim fancy that he was ill in bed; then realised his position with a mountaineer's intelligence, and worked himself loose and, after a rest or so, out until he saw the stars. He rested flat upon his chest for a space, wondering where he was and what had happened to him. He explored his limbs, and discovered that several of his buttons were gone and his coat turned over his head. His knife had gone from his pocket and his hat was lost, though he had tied it under his chin. He recalled that he had been looking for loose stones to raise his piece of the <b>shelter</b> <b>wall.</b> His ice-axe had disappeared.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some of {{the main}} numerical results obtained while simulating the wind flow over a shelter covering a coal storage. The aim of this numerical study was to evaluate the change in flow patterns caused by adding an impermeable wall to the originally open shelter. The numerical simulations of selected two-dimensional cases were performed using an open-source CFD code. The flow model is based on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations solved using a finite-volume method on a structured grid. The turbulence is parametrized using the standard k − ε model. Two <b>shelter</b> <b>wall</b> configuration variants are evaluated, and are compared with the original open shelter setup...|$|E
40|$|Along the Vandenberg {{coastal plain}} of California, Beehive Shelter overlooks the western {{shores of the}} Pacific Ocean (Figure 5. 1 colour section). In areas where {{survival}} is possible, faint black geometric lines and amorphous splodges of red pigment can be seen smeared {{on the surface of}} the <b>shelter</b> <b>wall.</b> In comparison to the vibrant and visually compelling polychrome pictographs typifying rock-art produced by the coastal indigenous peoples known as the Chumash, the pigment at Beehive Shelter hardly merits attention. There are no anthropomorphic or zoomorphic creatures to be seen, no series of deftly applied dotted or fine lined applications, nor any of the elaborate discs that typify Chumash rock-art (Grant 1965). At nearby Rattlesnake Shelter, similar splodges of non-representational swaths of red pigment also defy conventional categorisation (Figure 5. 2 colour section). These red smears cannot comfortably be interpreted as representational images of animals, plants, tools, or entoptic phenomena. The marks seem to stand in the simplest of terms for what they are – red pigment on rock...|$|E

40|$|Archaeobotanical {{studies on}} macro-remains and pollen, carried out within a {{multidisciplinary}} research framework, provided {{information on the}} past human-environment relationships and on the Holocene landscape evolution of Central Sahara. This has been repetitively obtained by the studies on rockshelters and caves which are widely distributed in this desert region. The site of Takarkori is a large rockshelter with a well preserved stratigraphic series located in the Acacus Mts. (south-western Libya, central Sahara), {{not far from the}} Algerian border. It represents an important source of information about the past Saharan environment and the human-plant relationships in that area. The archaeological excavation of this site (University of Rome “La Sapienza”, www. acacus. it) were carried out from 2003 to 2006 over a surface of ca. 120 square metres and brought to light occupation layers radiocarbon dated between ca. 4500 and 8600 uncal. years bp. It hosts a 1. 6 m thick archaeological deposit including structures, fireplaces and 15 burials of women and childs buried near the <b>shelter</b> <b>wall.</b> During the excavation 85 accumulation of plants (called “spot”) were listed and about 50 of them contain only carpological macroremains and will be useful for investigations on wild cereals. All these carpological spot samples were calculated by weight and volume; a preliminary analysis on the content was done. Spot analysis of the most interesting (for content and/or position in the archaeological site) is in progress and preliminary data are available. In the Centre for Ancient DNA Research of the University of Copenhagen, the extraction of ancient DNA was carried out on records from three spot samples. Many were the initial doubts about the preservation of DNA material so old (two of the spot samples are dated 8000 uncal. years bp; one is dated ca. 6000 - 5500 uncal. years bp) and stored in dry condition, but the excellent state of preservation (most of spikelets were wholly intact) has yet to find well-preserved DNA (only one sample did not work). Most of DNA sequences agree with the identifications {{made on the basis of}} morphological analysis...|$|E
40|$|The archaeobotanical {{record from}} the Takarkori rockshelter (Fezzan, {{south-western}} Libya) was systematically {{collected in the}} 2003 - 2006 excavation seasons. The archaeological excavation was carried out over a surface of ca. 120 square metres and brought to light occupation layers radiocarbon dated between ca. 4500 and 8900 uncal. years bp. The rockshelter hosts a 1. 6 m thick archaeological deposit including structures, fireplaces and burials {{of women and children}} interred near the <b>shelter</b> <b>wall.</b> An impressive amount of mainly desiccated and well preserved plant macroremains was brought to light from Late Acacus and Pastoral layers. Known amount of sediment (3 or 6 l) were dry sieved. Charcoals and seeds/fruits concentrations visible to naked eye were also collected. Pollen was sampled from on-site trenches including different amount of organic matter: the best results were obtained from a sequence of thirty samples. The main pollen zones were in agreement with main cultural changes in the archaeological record. Moreover, the exceptionally well-preserved fruits of Poaceae encouraged analyses on aDNA (done in the Centre for Ancient DNA Research of the University of Copenhagen). The extraction of ancient DNA was carried out on records from three samples of Poaceae fruits accumulation (spot n° 8136, 1423 and A 2908). Two of the spot samples are dated to ca. 8000 uncal. years bp; one is dated to ca. 6000 - 5500 uncal. years bp. Notwithstanding the common doubts about the possibility of DNA preservation in arid and hot environments, the lab study was quite successful, with 5 out of 6 samples extracted and with 3 out of 5 correctly identified. DNA sequences (blind analyses) from Echinochloa, Panicum and Sorghum agree with the identifications {{made on the basis of}} morphological analysis. Further elaborations of the sequences obtained allowed to reach a more detailed identification of the genus Panicum, which compared with the sequences currently available in the online database seems to be P. laetum. The integrated archaeobotanical studies on macroremains and pollen, carried out within a multidisciplinary research framework, provided information on the past human-environment relationships and on the Holocene landscape evolution of the area...|$|E

Sidsel N. Millerstrom’s groundbreaking archaeological research is based on more than 15 years of field work in the islands. Surveying the dramatic landscapes of the deep valleys and thick forests of the Marquesas, Millerstrom and her team found a significant quantity of rock art. They learned that every image was not randomly placed but rather purposefully positioned according to prehistoric Marquesan cultural norms. The images were found on public and private prehistoric architecture, on outcrops, rock <b>shelters,</b> <b>walls</b> of underground pits, narrow ridges and springs. Based on our present understanding of science, Millerstrom also explains what the prehistoric petroglyphs, pictographs and anthropomorphic sculptures probably signified to the past inhabitants...|$|R
