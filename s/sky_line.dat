But from January 1843, the public were treated to the sight of {{telegraph}} wires against the <b>sky</b> <b>line,</b> across the top of the viaduct, for the first time. Cooke had renegotiated the contract with the GWR and extended the telegraph to Slough, using a simpler two-needle instrument that could be supplied with just two wires suspended from porcelain insulators on poles.|$|E

The fall of the two redoubts enabled the troops pinned down near the lighthouse to advance towards V Beach until more wire was encountered. Troops tried to cut through but were visible on the <b>sky</b> <b>line</b> and shot down. Observers on Queen Elizabeth and Albion [...] offshore watched the attempts while unable to open fire due to ignorance of the situation ashore. After an hour the wire was cut but the troops were pinned down again on the far side.|$|E

60|$|At {{the sight}} of Jessie {{mounting}} against the <b>sky</b> <b>line</b> the people coming up the hill suddenly became excited and ended Jessie's doubts at once. Two handkerchiefs waved, and some one shouted. The riders of the tandem bicycle began to run it up hill, past the other vehicles.

60|$|The palace was a four-roomed, white-washed mud-and-timber house, {{the finest}} {{in all the}} Hills for a day's journey. The king {{was dressed in a}} purple velvet jacket, white muslin trousers, and a saffron-yellow turban of price. He gave me {{audience}} in a little carpeted room opening off the palace courtyard, which was occupied by the elephant of state.

60|$|A cold, {{piercing}} air {{seemed to}} blow right through her. Walking to the near corner, {{she paused to}} look around. Down the main street flowed a leisurely stream of pedestrians, horses, cars, extending between two blocks of low buildings. Across from where she stood lay a vacant lot, beyond which began a line of neat, oddly constructed houses, evidently residences of the town. And then lifting her gaze, instinctively drawn by something obstructing the <b>sky</b> <b>line,</b> she was suddenly struck with surprise and delight.|$|E
60|$|Sitting in {{meditation}} {{while the}} Professor went round with a sacrilegious camera, {{to the vast}} terror of the Burmese youth, I made two notable discoveries and nearly went to sleep over them.

There was one between me and the far-off <b>sky</b> <b>line,</b> and it exactly duplicated the outlines of a small grey stone building.|$|E

60|$|As {{they looked}} back, {{they saw the}} heavens red with the great flames that sprang high above the lofty towers. Immense volumes of dense smoke rolled southward across the <b>sky</b> <b>line.</b> Occasionally it would clear away from the burning castle for an instant to show the black walls pierced by their {{hundreds}} of embrasures, each lit up by the red of the raging fire within. It was a gorgeous, impressive spectacle, but one so common in those fierce, wild days, that none thought it worthy {{of more than a}} passing backward glance.|$|E

Standing upright, it turned round, and peeping out of its folds Cousin Christopher saw a child's face. And then looking closer saw that it wasn't a child. And then wasn't quite sure what it was; so that coming to a sudden halt in front of it, Cousin Christopher stared at it with round wide eyes, and then at Flight Commander Raffleton.|$|E
60|$|The city wall {{appeared}} to be about thirty feet in height, its plastered expanse unbroken except by occasional embrasures. Beyond the wall rose the domes of several structures and numerous minarets dotted the <b>sky</b> <b>line</b> of the city. The largest and central dome {{appeared to}} be gilded, while others were red, or blue, or yellow. The architecture of the wall itself was of uncompromising simplicity. It was of a cream shade and {{appeared to be}} plastered and painted. At its base was a line of well-tended shrubs and at some distance towards its eastern extremity it was vine covered to the top.|$|E

60|$|When the Highlander {{began to}} pull really hard upon the oars, Turnbull craned his {{dripping}} red {{head out of the}} boat to see the goal of his exertions. It was a sufficiently uninviting one; nothing so far as could be seen but a steep and shelving bank of shingle, made of loose little pebbles such as children like, but slanting up higher than a house. On the top of the mound, against the <b>sky</b> <b>line,</b> stood up the brown skeleton of some broken fence or breakwater.

60|$|The {{house of}} Captain Masterton Dows, at Pineville, Kentucky, {{was a fine}} {{specimen}} of Southern classical architecture, being an exact copy of Major Fauquier's house in Virginia, which was in turn only a slight variation from a well-known statesman's historical villa in Alabama, that everybody knew was designed from a famous Greek temple on the Piraeus. Not but that it shared this resemblance with the County Court House and the Odd Fellows' Hall, but the addition of training jessamine and Cherokee rose to the columns of the portico, and over the colonnade leading to its offices, showed a certain domestic distinction. And the <b>sky</b> <b>line</b> of its incongruously high roof was pleasantly broken against adjacent green pines, butternut, and darker cypress.|$|E
