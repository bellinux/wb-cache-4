40|$|Salvage {{radiation}} therapy {{is the sole}} curative treatment for patients experiencing biochemical relapse after radical surgical treatment of prostate cancer. The main dilemma in salvage {{radiation therapy}} is, whether or not biochemical relapse represents purely localized recurrent disease in the prostatic fossa or <b>systemic</b> <b>micrometastasis.</b> Initiating salvage radiation therapy at an early time point raises its chances of success, but may lead to overtreatment of patients. Target volume definition and treatment techniques are a matter of current research, with still many questions unanswered. Strategies of treatment escalation either by increasing the treatment dose or combining radiation therapy with androgen deprivation therapy are being addressed in clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Background:The role {{of surgery}} in the {{treatment}} of nonâ€“small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with clinically manifested mediastinal node metastasis is controversial even in resectable cases because it is often accompanied by <b>systemic</b> <b>micrometastasis.</b> However, surgery is occasionally indicated for cases with single-station N 2 disease or within multimodal treatment regimens, and in clinical trials. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate surgical outcomes in a modern cohort of patients with clinical (c-) stage IIIA-N 2 NSCLC whose nodal metastasis was confirmed by pathology (cN 2 /pN 2). Methods:From the central database of lung cancer patients undergoing surgery in 2004, which was founded by the Japanese Joint Committee for Lung Cancer Registration, data of patients having all conditions of NSCLC, c-stage IIIA, cN 2, and pN 2 were extracted, and the clinicopathologic profile of patients and surgical outcomes were evaluated. Results:Among 11, 663 registered NSCLC cases, 436 patients (3. 8 %) (332 men and 104 women) had been extracted. Their mean age was 65 years, and histologic types included adenocarcinoma (n = 246), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 132), and others (n = 58). The proportion of R 0 resection was 82. 5 % and the proportion of the hospital deaths among the cause of death was 2. 3 %. The 5 -year survival rate was 30. 1 % for the selected group of patients. The postoperative prognosis was significantly better than those of corresponding populations extracted from the 1994 (p = 0. 0001) and 1999 databases (p = 0. 0411). Men and women experienced a significantly different survival outcome (p = 0. 025) with 5 -year survivals of 27. 5 % and 37. 8 %, respectively. Single-station N 2 cases occupied 60. 9 % of the cohort and showed a significantly better prognosis than multistation N 2 (p = 0. 0053, 35. 8 % versus 22. 0 % survival rate at 5 years). Conclusions:The surgical outcomes of c-stage IIIA-cN 2 /pN 2 NSCLC patients in 2004 were favorable in comparison with those ever reported...|$|E
