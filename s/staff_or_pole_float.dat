50|$|A barber's pole {{is a type}} of sign used by barbers {{to signify}} the place or shop where they perform their craft. The trade sign is, by a {{tradition}} dating back to the Middle Ages, a <b>staff</b> <b>or</b> <b>pole</b> with a helix of colored stripes (often red and white in many countries, but usually red, blue, and white in the United States). The pole may be stationary or may revolve, often with the aid of an electric motor.|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time Messalina and Silius, wholly {{unconscious}} of the danger, gave themselves up with {{greater and greater}} boldness and unconcern to their guilty pleasures. On the day when Callistus and his party went to Ostia she was celebrating a festival at her palace with great gayety and splendor. It was {{in the autumn of}} the year, and the festival was in honor of the season. In the countries on the Mediterranean the gathering of grapes and the pressing of the juice for wine, is the great subject of autumnal rejoicings; and Messalina had arranged a festival in accordance with the usual customs, in the gardens of the palace. A wine-press had been erected, and grapes were gathered and brought to it. The guests whom Messalina had invited were assembled around; some were dancing about the wine-press, some were walking in the alleys, and some were seated in the neighboring bowers. They were dressed in fancy costumes, and their heads were adorned with garlands of flowers. There was a group of dancing girls who were engaged as performers on the occasion, to dance for the amusement of the company, in honor of Bacchus, the god of wine. These girls were dressed, so far as they were clothed at all, in robes made of the skins of tigers, and their heads were crowned with flowers. Messalina herself, however, was the most conspicuous object among the gay throng. She was robed in a manner to display most fully the graces of her person; her long hair waving loosely in the wind. She had in her hand a symbol, or badge, called the thyrsus, which was an ornamented <b>staff,</b> <b>or</b> <b>pole,</b> surmounted with a carved representation of a bunch of grapes, and with other ornaments and emblems. The thyrsus was always used in the rites and festivities celebrated in honor of Bacchus. Silius himself, dressed like the rest in a fantastic and theatrical costume, danced by the side of Messalina, {{in the center of a}} ring of dancing girls which was formed around them.|$|R
6000|$|To obviate {{a certain}} rolling propensity, the Tahitians, like all Polynesians, attach to them what sailors call an [...] "outrigger." [...] It {{consists}} of a <b>pole</b> <b>floating</b> alongside, parallel to the canoe, and connected with it {{by a couple of}} cross sticks, a yard or more in length. Thus equipped, the canoe cannot be overturned, unless you overcome the buoyancy of the <b>pole,</b> <b>or</b> lift it entirely out of the water.|$|R
50|$|A <b>staff,</b> <b>pole</b> <b>or</b> rod. Silat exponents {{regard it}} as the most {{versatile}} of all weapons. They are typically made of rattan, but some are made from bamboo or steel. Staves can also {{be referred to as}} tiang or kayu. The word galah refers to the pole used for knocking fruit down from trees or when punting a boat. Another term pedagang (literally meaning trader or merchant) refers to the carrying pole. The pedagang is traditionally made from ruyung, a type of palm wood. The best pedagang are said to come from the Mentawai Islands Regency where the wood is soaked in coconut oil for three years. Staves are usually 5-6 feet in length and 1.5-2 inches in diameter. A longstaff is called galah panjang.|$|R

50|$|The {{area was}} first called Governor's Right because 500 acres (200 hectares) were granted to Governor Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire. It was {{purchased}} by Er Chamberlin, who built a gristmill on the Wells River. Located {{at the head of}} navigation for the Connecticut River, Wells River developed as a center for trade. Canal boats guided by long <b>poles</b> <b>floated</b> downriver laden with lumber, clapboards and shingles, returning with goods such as iron, salt, rum and molasses.|$|R
5000|$|Walking sticks, {{also known}} as {{trekking}} poles, pilgrim's <b>staffs,</b> hiking <b>poles</b> <b>or</b> hiking sticks, are used by hikers {{for a wide variety}} of purposes: to clear spider webs, or part thick bushes or grass obscuring the trail; as a support when going uphill or a brake when going downhill; as a balance point when crossing streams, swamps or other rough terrain; to feel for obstacles in the path; to test mud and puddles for depth; and as a defence against wild animals. Also known as an alpenstock, from its origins in mountaineering in the Alps, such a walking stick is equipped with a steel point and a hook or pick on top. A walking stick can be improvised from nearby felled wood. More ornate sticks are made for avid hikers, and are often adorned with small trinkets or medallions depicting [...] "conquered" [...] territory. Wood walking sticks are used for outdoor sports, healthy upper body exercise and even club, department and family memorials. They can be individually handcrafted from a number of woods, and may be personalised in many ways for the owner.|$|R

50|$|Immunity Challenge: A rope {{having three}} knots {{was tied to}} a <b>pole</b> <b>floating</b> in the ocean. The castaways would start by {{holding on to the}} first knot and would advance to the next knot at {{specific}} time intervals. The individual {{to hold on to the}} last knot the longest would win individual immunity. JD, having the advantage of the item he had bought at the auction, would stay one knot ahead of the others. So, when the other castaways were holding on to the third knot, he would be holding on to the second knot.|$|R

50|$|The hoopoe {{starling}} {{was described}} as tame and easily hunted. In 1704, Jean Feuilley explained how the birds were caught by humans and cats: Hoopoes and merles Hypsipetes borbonicus are the same fatness as those in France, and are of a marvellous taste, which are fat {{at the same time}} as parrots, living on the same foods. In order to catch them, hunting was done with <b>staffs</b> <b>or</b> long thin <b>poles</b> from six to seven feet in length, though this hunt is infrequently seen. The marrons escaped cats destroy many. These birds allow themselves to be approached very closely, so the cats take them without leaving their places. The hoopoe starling was kept as a cagebird on Réunion and Mauritius, and although the bird was becoming scarcer, a number of specimens were obtained during the early 19th century. It is unknown whether any live specimens were ever transported from the Mascarenes. Cordemoy recalled that captive birds could be fed a wide variety of food, such as bananas, potatoes, and chayote, and wild birds would never enter inhabited areas. Many individuals survived on Mauritius after escaping there, and it was thought that a feral population could be established. However, the Mauritian population lasted less than a decade; the final specimen on the island (the last definite record of a live specimen anywhere) was taken in 1836. Specimens could still be collected on Réunion during the 1830s and, possibly, the early 1840s.|$|R
