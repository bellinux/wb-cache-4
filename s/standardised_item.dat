40|$|In the {{highlands}} of the Northern Philippines, {{a model of}} long-term relationships between potato farmers and their preferred seed suppliers is proposed. In {{the absence of any}} certified seed system that might provide some guarantee of seed quality, farmers prefer to transact with those seed suppliers with whom they have had some favourable prior experience. Such suppliers provide both the best quality seed and, since most farmers must borrow the capital to purchase the seed, the most favourable terms of repayment. As there is much uncertainty in the exchange, the farmer's relationship with their preferred seed supplier is based on trust. However, since the farmer's satisfaction with the exchange cannot be ascertained until after purchase, trust is antecedent to satisfaction. As satisfaction is derived from the economic benefits the farmer obtains, satisfaction will lead to the farmer's desire to maintain the relationship. Satisfaction is enhanced both by the seed supplier's willingness to extend credit and to provide information. As there is much variation between alternative seed supplier's offer quality, satisfaction will result in the farmer becoming more dependent upon that seed supplier who makes the best offer. Furthermore, having provided the farmer with financial assistance, seed suppliers will find that they have constrained their opportunities to use coercive influence strategies, for {{in the absence of any}} formal contract, farmer's may readily default on the loan. The use of coercive influence strategies will reduce both the farmer's trust in their preferred seed supplier and the farmer's desire to maintain the relationship. While trust is more important in the transitional economies, critical problems emerge with the use of <b>standardised</b> <b>item</b> measures and scales developed in the industrial countries. Cultural specific adjustments are necessary to ensure social constructs such a trust are functionally equivalent. However, in the context of long-term relationships where satisfaction is also cumulative, introducing measures of both economic and social satisfaction have the potential to overlap with the generally accepted measures of trust...|$|E

Analyses of reliability, cross-method coherence, taxonomic structures and socio-demographic associations highlighted substantial biases in assessments.

Focusing on adult behaviour, we propose a set of e-cigarette use items, discuss their utility and potential adaptation, and highlight e-cigarette constructs that researchers should avoid without further item development. Reliable and valid items will strengthen the emerging science and inform knowledge synthesis for policy-making. Building on informal discussions at a series of international meetings of 65 experts from 15 countries, the authors provide recommendations for assessing e-cigarette use behaviour, relative perceived harm, device type, presence of nicotine, flavours and reasons for use. We recommend items assessing eight core constructs: e-cigarette ever use, frequency of use and former daily use; relative perceived harm; device type; primary flavour preference; presence of nicotine; and primary reason for use. These <b>items</b> should be <b>standardised</b> or minimally adapted for the policy context and target population. Researchers should be prepared to update items as e-cigarette device characteristics change. A minimum set of e-cigarette items is proposed to encourage consensus around items to allow for cross-survey and cross-jurisdictional comparisons of e-cigarette use behaviour. These proposed items are a starting point. We recognise room for continued improvement, and welcome input from e-cigarette users and scientific colleagues...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and analyses}} clinicians’ assessments of workplace privacy and security (PaS) {{training in the}} context of contemporary health information system (HIS) practice. The PaS training underpins national e-health frameworks. The paper draws on findings from a forthcoming dissertation. The ‘questerview’ technique was applied to this case study of 26 clinicians in three Victorian (Australia) public hospitals. The technique relies on data collection that applies standardised questions and questionnaires during interviews. Respondents were recorded while they completed the standardised questions and questionnaires and were encouraged to discuss their responses to items in detail. Data analysis involved the scrutiny of ‘questerview’ transcripts to identify emergent themes. Responses to the <b>standardised</b> <b>items</b> led to rich sources of qualitative data. The majority of clinicians had attended workplace PaS training sessions. The sessions took a variety of forms including written handouts, system training and induction programs. Some clinicians were unaware of the training sessions or found them poorly implemented. Scheduling problems meant many clinicians found the sessions difficult to attend. Clinician feedback indicates that workplace PaS training sessions for HIS were poor. The sessions were not ongoing or related to clinical practice concerns and can best be summed up as ‘irrelevant’ to HIS practice. Irrelevant PaS training sessions hamper clinical confidence in HIS practice and the introduction of unified e-health records at national levels. The clinicians’ feedback suggests a pressing need for further research and contextual reviews of HIS PaS training protocols nationally and across the globe...|$|R

The use of these techniques in the decommissioning of nuclear facilities continues to increase this experience.

Studies attempting to understand the reasons for these differences have been somewhat hampered by the fact that different types of costing methods are used, having different data requirements.

Methods participants completed 44 items from an initial draft of the BASQID and 30 completed the items on a second occasion, 2 weeks later. Item analytic criteria, including item facility, score distributions, tests of internal consistency and reproducibility, were used to reduce the item pool, and the reliability of the reduced pool was examined. Results twenty items were removed from the item pool. All retained items had at least moderate test-retest reliability (0. 41), with 13 items displaying good to very good reliability (0. 61).

30|$|To begin with, {{we believe}} it is {{imperative}} to collect more systematic data on family involvement and its link to educational success for children of immigrants in Europe. Such a data collection would allow for a standardised analysis across a number of countries and immigrant origin groups and help to bring out country differences. The papers by Schnell and Keskiner in this volume underline the advantage of using such comparable cross-national data showing that different institutional settings determine the relevance of family involvement for educational success by children of immigrants. We further believe that immigrant specific surveys should include questions around family involvement that are geared towards non-instrumental support. Recent surveys frequently conceptualise family involvement as instrumental support, such as the amount of help with homework. However, as many contributions in this special issue highlight, immigrant parents develop alternative strategies of involvement that should be subject to future survey research (e.g. mobilising non-familial resources or the significance of parental aspirations). Moreover, our collection of papers provides evidence for the advantage of studying the importance of other family agents that significantly influence the schooling processes by children of immigrants, beyond their parents. Amongst them, older siblings seem to be of particular importance. We therefore suggest that future (survey based) studies should include measures of siblings’ involvement in school related issues for the second-generation (beyond just the number of siblings in families). At the same time, we also think it is useful to supplement quantitative findings with results from qualitative follow-up interviews. In other words, mixed-methods research designs seem to be of great advantage when investigating the correlation between types of family involvement and the educational success by children of immigrants. Alternative strategies of involvement, such as notional or emotional support by immigrant parents, are oftentimes hard to examine through <b>standardised</b> survey <b>items.</b> Instead, as convincingly shown in the contribution by Moguérou & Santelli, Rezai et al. or Keskiner in this special issue, follow-up interviews with survey respondents might help to uncover specific mechanisms by those who have overcome barriers and achieved educational success.|$|R
40|$|Objective ‐ To {{investigate}} {{the validity and}} reliability of the Information Skills Survey for Assessment of Information Literacy in Higher Education (CAUL ISS) (Catts, “Administration Manual”) for identifying the information literacy skills of first and fourth‐year medical students. The CAUL ISS is a <b>standardised,</b> 20 <b>item</b> self‐report inventory of information literacy skills of higher education students. It exists in two forms, namely a generic form and a law discipline specific form. This paper {{is concerned with the}} suitability of the generic form ofthe survey for use with medical students. Methods ‐ The generic form of the CAUL ISS was administered to 86 first‐year and 120 fourth‐year medical students and the reliabilities were computed. In addition, students {{were asked to respond to}} two open‐ended questions about their information literacy. Subsequently, having noted that the fourth‐year students rated themselves significantly more severely on seven of the 20 items, four of this cohort were interviewed to identify the extent to which the CAUL ISS addressed the range of their techniques for information use and to identify any specific content validity issues in the application of the CAUL ISS scale to this population. Results ‐ The reliability of the CAUL ISS was confirmed for both years, but the evidence from an analysis of the individual items and from the open‐ended questions and the interviews indicated that the fourth‐year students adopt a wider range of information gathering techniques, appropriate to their clinical experience than measured by the survey. The CAUL ISS demonstrated content validity for first‐year students but its scope was not sufficient for content validity for fourth‐year students. Further investigations are required todetermine the full scope of competencies required for content validity with the fourth‐year cohort. Conclusion ‐ The evidence suggests that the generic form of the CAUL ISS is suitable for use to estimate the information skills of first year medical students. For fourth‐year students, suggestions are made for the use of the CAUL ISS in the context of their additional situated information literacy...|$|R

The most important was that strict blood pressure control was a more cost-effective intervention than less strict control, as shown by six studies reporting cost savings to very low costs per life-year gained. Primary and secondary prevention of type 2 diabetes were also highly cost effective, but these results were based on very few studies. Medications to reduce weight and hyperglycaemia together were cost effective compared with conventional interventions.

DESIGN: Cross sectional, single phase survey based on a stratified cluster sample of 70 United Kingdom secondary schools during March and April 1995. Pupils completed a 406 <b>item</b> <b>standardised</b> questionnaire under examination conditions. SETTING: United Kingdom state and private secondary schools. SUBJECTS: 7722 pupils aged 15 and 16. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reported use of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. RESULTS: Almost all the pupils had drunk alcohol, 36 % (2772 / 7689) had smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days, and 42. 3 % (3264 / 7722) had at some time used illicit drugs, mainly cannabis. 43 % (1546 / 3546) of boys and 38 % (1529 / 4009) of girls had tried cannabis. Higher levels of smoking were associated with poorer school performance (20. 4 % (783 / 3840) with average performance v 44. 1 % (214 / 486) with below average performance, F = 79. 06, P < 0. 01).

Moreover, we aim to provide a complete overview of the content of the Dutch IBD Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: Since 2007, every patient with IBD treated in one of the eight Dutch university medical centres is asked to participate in the Dutch IBD Biobank in which 225 <b>standardised</b> IBD-related data <b>items</b> and biomaterials, such as serum, DNA, biopsies and a stool sample, are collected.

40|$|Rats {{and mice}} {{are the most}} {{commonly}} used species as laboratory animal models of diseases in biomedical research. Environmental factors such as cage size, number of cage mates and cage structure such as environmental enrichment can affect the physiology and behavioural development of laboratory animals and their well-being throughout their lives. Therefore compromising the animals' well-being due to inadequate environmental conditions would diminish the value of the research models. In order to improve laboratory animals' well-being and promote the quality of animal based biomedical research, it is fundamentally important that the environment of the animals meets the animals' species typical behavioural needs. Standardisation of environmental enrichment for laboratory rats and mice therefore should provide possibilities for the animals to engage in at least the essential behavioural needs such as social contact, nest building, exploring and foraging. There is a wide variety of environmental enrichment items commercially available for laboratory mice and rats. However, how these items are used by the animals, their practicality in the laboratory and whether these enrichments might lead to increased variation in experimental results have not been widely assessed. In this study, we implemented two <b>standardised</b> enrichment <b>items</b> (shelters, nesting materials) for rats and mice at different animal units. We instructed the animal care staff in monitoring the use of enrichment items by the animals by means of a daily score sheet system. The animal staff's viewpoint on practicality of the standardised enrichment program was assessed with a monthly score sheet survey. Also we assessed whether the enriched environment affected breeding results and contributed to an increase in variation of experimental data from several participating current studies. Our results show that the animals readily used the provided enrichment items. A slight increase in workload for the animal staff was reported. However, the overall judgement was mainly reported as good. Breeding results and variation in experimental data did not reveal differences as compared to data from previous housing and/or non enriched housing conditions. Overall, the results indicate that standard environmental enrichment that is species appropriate may enhance the animal's well-being without undesirable side effects on the experimental outcome and daily working routine of the animal care staff...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{feasibility}} of prospectively monitoring treatment efficacy and tolerability of infliximab, etanercept, and leflunomide over a two year period in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in clinical practice using a structured protocol. METHODS: All patients with RA at seven centres in southern Sweden, for whom at least two disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, including methotrexate, had failed or not been tolerated, who started treatment with either infliximab, etanercept, or leflunomide were included. They were evaluated at predefined times using a <b>standardised</b> protocol including <b>items</b> required for evaluating response to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) or EULAR criteria. All adverse events were recorded using World Health Organisation terminology. Concomitant treatment and survival while receiving a drug were recorded. RESULTS: During the study 166 patients were treated with etanercept, 135 with infliximab, and 103 with leflunomide. Treatment response {{as determined by the}} ACR and EULAR response criteria was similar for the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers. The TNF blockers performed significantly better than leflunomide both as determined by the response criteria and by survival on drug analysis. Thus 79 % and 75 % continued to receive etanercept or infliximab compared with 22 % of patients who started leflunomide after 20 months. The spectrum of side effects did not differ from those previously reported in the clinical trials. The initial two year experience of a protocol for postmarketing surveillance of etanercept, infliximab, and leflunomide shows that a structured protocol with central data handling can be used in clinical practice for documenting the performance of newly introduced drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy data for the TNF blockers comply with results in clinical trials, whereas leflunomide appeared to perform worse than in clinical trials.

40|$|Purpose Managers {{generally}} have discretion {{in determining how}} components of earnings are presented in financial statements in distinguishing between ‘normal’ earnings and items classified as unusual, special, significant, exceptional or abnormal. Prior {{research has found that}} such intra-period classificatory choice is used as a form of earnings management. Prior to 2001, Australian accounting standards mandated that unusually large items of revenue and expense be classified as ‘abnormal items’ for financial reporting, but this classification was removed from accounting standards from 2001. This move by the regulators was partly in response to concerns that the abnormal classification was being used opportunistically to manage reported pre-abnormal earnings. This study extends the earnings management literature by examining the reporting of abnormal items for evidence of intra-period classificatory earnings management in the unique Australian setting. Design/methodology/approach This study investigates associations between reporting of abnormal items and incentives in the form of analyst following and the earnings benchmarks of analysts’ forecasts, earnings levels, and earnings changes, for a sample of Australian top- 500 firms for the seven-year period from 1994 to 2000. Findings The findings suggest there are systematic differences between firms reporting abnormal items and those with no abnormal items. Results show evidence that, on average, firms shifted expense items from pre-abnormal earnings to bottom line net income through reclassification as abnormal losses. Originality/value These findings suggest that the standard setters were justified in removing the ‘abnormal’ classification from the accounting standard. However, it cannot be assumed that all firms acted opportunistically in the classification of items as abnormal. With the removal of the <b>standardised</b> classification of <b>items</b> outside normal operations as ‘abnormal’, firms lost the opportunity to use such disclosures as a signalling device, with the consequential effect of limiting the scope of effectively communicating information about the nature of items presented in financial reports...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{assumed that the}} social deficits {{inherent}} in autism imply that individuals with the condition will be unable fully to appreciate the emotional content of music. My aim was to test this assumption, and to explore more widely {{the similarities and differences}} between the experience of music in the normal population and those with autism. My first study used musically-induced mood changes and a behavioural measure to show that music does indeed have a more than superficial effect on cognitive processes in a control group. The second study focused on high-functioning adults on the autism spectrum, using semi-structured interviews to investigate the part that music played in their everyday lives, concluding that autism is no bar to full appreciation of the emotional uses of music, though suggesting a degree of impoverishment in the language they used to describe the emotions. The final set of experiments compared control and autism group directly, using physiological (GSR) measures of arousal together with self-report of the emotions evoked by a set of musical <b>items.</b> <b>Standardised</b> questionnaires were used to measure alexithymia (difficulty in identifying and describing feelings) in individuals. Although the autism group experienced comparable levels of physiological arousal to music, they used fewer words than the control group to describe their emotional responses, a difference which correlated strongly with their level of alexithymia. My results are consistent with the hypothesis that in autism, the basic physiological and emotional component of their reactivity to music is functioning normally, but that their ability to translate these reactions into conventional emotional language is reduced, precisely in line with the extent of their alexithymia. These results suggest that the preserved ability of music to generate emotional arousal in autism may lead to clinical applications for the treatment of alexithymia in autism and other conditions.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether {{the adoption of the}} CONSORT checklist is associated with improvement in the quality of reporting of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and reference lists of included studies and of experts were searched to identify eligible studies published between 1996 and 2005. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were eligible if they (a) compared CONSORT-adopting and non-adopting journals after the publication of CONSORT, (b) compared CONSORT adopters before and after publication of CONSORT, or (c) a combination of (a) and (b). Outcomes examined included reports for any of the 22 items on the CONSORT checklist or overall trial quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: 1128 studies were retrieved, of which 248 were considered possibly relevant. Eight studies were included in the review. CONSORT adopters had significantly better reporting of the method of sequence generation (risk ratio [RR], 1. 67; 95 % CI, 1. 19 - 2. 33), allocation concealment (RR, 1. 66; 95 % CI, 1. 37 - 2. 00) and overall number of CONSORT <b>items</b> than non-adopters (<b>standardised</b> mean difference, 0. 83; 95 % CI, 0. 46 - 1. 19). CONSORT adoption had less effect on reporting of participant flow (RR, 1. 14; 95 % CI, 0. 89 - 1. 46) and blinding of participants (RR, 1. 09; 95 % CI, 0. 84 - 1. 43) or data analysts (RR, 5. 44; 95 % CI, 0. 73 - 36. 87). In studies examining CONSORT-adopting journals before and after the publication of CONSORT, description of the method of sequence generation (RR, 2. 78; 95 % CI, 1. 78 - 4. 33), participant flow (RR, 8. 06; 95 % CI, 4. 10 - 15. 83), and total CONSORT <b>items</b> (<b>standardised</b> mean difference, 3. 67 items; 95 % CI, 2. 09 - 5. 25) were improved after adoption of CONSORT by the journal. CONCLUSIONS: Journal adoption of CONSORT is associated with improved reporting of RCTs...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Managers {{generally}} have discretion {{in determining how}} components of earnings are presented in financial statements in distinguishing between "normal" earnings and items classified as unusual, special, significant, exceptional or abnormal. Prior {{research has found that}} such intra-period classificatory choice is used as a form of earnings management. Prior to 2001, Australian accounting standards mandated that unusually large items of revenue and expense be classified as "abnormal items" for financial reporting, but this classification was removed from accounting standards from 2001. This move by the regulators was partly in response to concerns that the abnormal classification was being used opportunistically to manage reported pre-abnormal earnings. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to extend the earnings management literature by examining the reporting of abnormal items for evidence of intra-period classificatory earnings management in the unique Australian setting. Design/methodology/approach - This study investigates associations between reporting of abnormal items and incentives in the form of analyst following and the earnings benchmarks of analysts' forecasts, earnings levels, and earnings changes, for a sample of Australian, top- 500 firms, for the seven-year period from 1994 to 2000. Findings - The findings suggest there are systematic differences between firms reporting abnormal items and those with no abnormal items. Results show evidence that, on average, firms shifted expense items from pre-abnormal earnings to bottom line net income through reclassification as abnormal losses. Originality/value - The paper's findings suggest that the standard setters were justified in removing the "abnormal" classification from the accounting standard. However, it cannot be assumed that all firms acted opportunistically in the classification of items as abnormal. With the removal of the <b>standardised</b> classification of <b>items</b> outside normal operations as "abnormal", firms lost the opportunity to use such disclosures as a signalling device, with the consequential effect of limiting the scope of effectively communicating information about the nature of items presented in financial reports.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the general}} {{population}} the prevalence of bipolar and schizophrenia is 0. 24 % and 1. 4 % respectively. People with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have a significantly reduced life expectancy, increased rates of unemployment and a fear of stigma leading to reduced self-confidence. A core outcome set is a <b>standardised</b> collection of <b>items</b> that should be reported in all controlled trials within a research area. There are currently no core outcome sets available for use in effectiveness trials involving bipolar or schizophrenia service users managed in a community setting. METHODS: A three-step approach {{is to be used}} to concurrently develop two core outcome sets, one for bipolar and one for schizophrenia. First, a comprehensive list of outcomes will be compiled through qualitative research and systematic searching of trial databases. Focus groups and one-to-one interviews will be completed with service users, carers and healthcare professionals. Second, a Delphi study will be used to reduce the lists to a core set. The three-round Delphi study will ask service users to score the outcome list for relevance. In round two stakeholders will only see the results of their group, while in round three stakeholders will see the results of all stakeholder group by stakeholder group. Third, a consensus meeting with stakeholders will be used to confirm outcomes {{to be included in the}} core set. Following the development of the core set a systematic literature review of existing measures will allow recommendations for how the core outcomes should be measured and a stated preference survey will explore the strength of people's preferences and estimate weights for the outcomes that comprise the core set. DISCUSSION: A core outcome set represents the minimum measurement requirement for a research area. We aim to develop core outcome sets for use in research involving service users with schizophrenia or bipolar managed in a community setting. This will inform the wider PARTNERS 2 study aims and objectives of developing an innovative primary care-based model of collaborative care for people with a diagnosis of bipolar or schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|Survival {{following}} critical {{illness is}} associated with a significant burden of physical and psychosocial morbidity and recovery is often protracted and/or incomplete. Recovery has been measured using, almost exclusively, generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires. There is, however, an inexorable lack of consensus on the conceptual definition of HRQoL, and existing measures have tended to reflect overtly biomedical concerns such as morbidity and impairment at population level. Limited empirical or theoretical work has examined the extent to which widely used measures reflect the individual’s concerns, “health”-related and otherwise. The primary aims of this PhD are to examine HRQoL among a rarely studied sub group of the critically ill patient population: survivors of prolonged critical illness, and to explore the extent to which professionally endorsed measures capture their experiences of and perspectives on the recovery process. The implications of “patient-centredness” are both diverse and far-reaching in terms of policy, practice and critical care outcomes research, and are discussed throughout. A review of the literature among a well studied sub group of the patient population (survivors of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome) identified the widespread use of generic and ancillary measures which were invariably developed for use among other patient populations. This approach was seen to offer limited insight to the putative relationship between critical illness-related morbidity and HRQoL. Reflecting existing professional recommendations and practice, the Short Form 36 (SF- 36) and the EuroQoL were administered by post to 20 survivors of prolonged critical illness at up to 6 months following ICU discharge. Each subsequently participated in a semi-structured interview, the purpose of which was to explore experiences and perceptions of ongoing morbidity within the contexts of the critical illness “journey” and, importantly, everyday life. A small number (n= 5) participated in cognitive interview in order to explore both the everyday logistics of questionnaire completion and the often startling inconsistencies between verbal and questionnaire response. Analysis here revealed the unexpectedly diverse and normally hidden processes through which survivors interpreted and responded to <b>standardised</b> questionnaire <b>items,</b> challenging traditional (i. e. psychometric) notions of validity. Data from the semi-structured interviews were “mapped” onto the dimensions of the SF- 36, revealing the highly contextualised and complex inter-relatedness of biomedically defined and ostensibly discrete aspects of experience. Morbidity was conceptualised by survivors in terms of the adaptive and interpretive processes adopted in everyday life (as opposed to a source of loss) and was generally under-reported in questionnaire form. An alternative explanatory framework for HRQoL was subsequently developed. Data were also analysed with reference to the “biographical narrative” of critical illness, a strategy which revealed the significance of survivors’ own stock of “life experience” (health-related and otherwise) in these interpretive and adaptive processes. The unexpectedly phlegmatic nature of survivors’ accounts directed attention to the narrative form, lending credibility to survivors’ claims that “things weren’t that bad”; accounts of seemingly intolerable morbidity were perceived, for example, as “a lucky escape”. This data also revealed, however, the influence of shortfalls in the processes and delivery of acute hospital rehabilitation upon the efficacy of these interpretive and adaptive processes. Mixed methods approaches to HRQoL, in summary, offer significant insights into survivors’ conceptualisations of morbidity, recovery, quality of life and the complex inter-relationships therein. Attention to the processes of adaptation also offers significant potential for the development of patient-centred measures of outcome and the expedition of the recovery process in ways which are most meaningful to survivors...|$|R
40|$|M. A. The {{time between}} the rhyming of the Psalms in 1936 and the {{subsequent}} rhyming thereof in 2001 is approximately 70 years. From 1936 to 2001 society has undergone drastic change. Such societal change normally influences language use and structure and brings about incremental and subtle changes in the language, resulting in new meaning being given to words and phrases in the new societal context. Such changes are mostly found in the lexicon of the relevant language. The lexicon is the medium of transmitting meaning, and if {{the meaning of the}} lexical item has changed in subsequent generations {{to the extent that the}} speakers of one generation do not understand the previous generation, it has become indicative of extensive modification of the language. The singing of the Psalms is historically associated with the accuracy of meaning transmitted by the Scripture by means of user-friendly language usage. Standardised use of language is always linked to aging and closely linked to the progress of time. The renewing of an aging language is important for subsequent generations to facilitate meaningful interpretative singing of the Psalms. However, the renewal of the religious register of the Psalms should always meet the rigorous test of accuracy to the Scripture as Calvin laid it down as a primary prerequisite during the Reformation. Because of the aging of language, as is the case with Afrikaans, the 1936 rhyming of the Psalms was done to facilitate the changes in the normal use of the language and to bring it closer to the la nguage then in use. In this way the standardisation of the language used in the rhyming of the Psalms was established, in accordance with the normal use of standard Afrikaans. During the past 70 odd years the religious register of Afrikaans aged again and resulted in the need for a new rhyming of the Psalms in accordance with the changed register of the language. This resulted in the 2001 rhyming of the Psalms and other Scripture-related hymns, attempting to bridge the gap between the register of formal religion and contemporary language. Using the DE-method, the psalmographer eliminated lexical items with a low frequency of use from the religious register as understanding of and access to these items by the user of the Psalm have become limited. Lexical items with a high frequency of use were selected and these words have moved into the current religious register. Changes in a language are subject to social forces and tensions. The forces of the changing modern society have led to the need to establish a new rhyme to the Psalms. Thus the formal reformative religious register was removed from the Psalms and replaced by the 2001 rhyme, which is representative of current language usage. The use of the new register is successful in the effective transfer of meaning as the essence of the Scripture was retained. Notwithstanding the loss of the archaic expressions of the 1936 rhyme in the 2001 version, the presence and expansion of meaning of core information is very much evident in the 2001 rhyme. By elimination of the great amount of archaic lexical expressions from the 1936 rhyme from the 2001 version, a clear movement in the reformative religious register of Afrikaans was executed. The social influence of the unsatisfactory acquisition of lexical items by the younger generation, pushing out the older form from the register, is very much evident in the register of the Psalms. The 2001 rhyme accelerates the process of elimination of such archaic und inaccessible lexical items from the register. The empirical study indicates the fact that many such archaic forms are already passive in especially the older generation and that active use of such archaic items has disappeared. The study furthermore indicates that Afrikaans contains enough synonyms to facilitate an effective transfer of meaning in such a new rhyme. These synonyms are established and <b>standardised</b> lexical <b>items</b> functioning as common language since the new translation of the Bible in Afrikaans (1983). The changes in language are subject to linguistic forces. Simplification is the most prominent linguistic force that manifests itself in the 2001 rhyme of the Psalms. Simplification makes it easier to understand the core content of the psalms and makes it accessible to all speakers of Afrikaans. Simplification is not only the decrease of lexical items in the language but includes adding difficult or expanded forms that bring balance to the process of change in the language. This adds value to the lexicon, as the items chosen for the rhyme are taken from the language register in its current form. The process is also in a sense held back by the fact that some items from the 1936 rhyme are still used in the 2001 version, putting a constraint on the development of the relevant lexicon. The modification of a language through simplification is mainly the result of reduction and expansion. The skills of the psalmographer resulted in both expansion and reduction as linguistic elements being present in the 2001 rhyme. The empirical study has shown tha t the psalmographer has not used the available synonyms. Instead, the psalmographer has used a total new approach by using a selection of techniques in the 2001 rhyme. These techniques focus on a tight use of specific rhyme patterns evident in the Psalms and its concomitant language usage resulting in extending the understanding of the psalms by the reader. This has also led to the effective communication by means of the reformative religious register. The psalmographer succeeded in creating a unique psa lm register and treasure. By virtue of their imbedded sacral element religious registers are strongly preservative factors preventing the acceptance and change of common language. Acceptance of the 2001 rhyme has already taken place as the rhyme is based on sound Scriptural principles, convincing the reformist reader of the Psalms of its truthfulness and credibility. The use of the accepted common language as already manifested in the new translation of the Bible (1983) also contributes to the acceptance of the 2001 rhyme. This is further reinforced by the appearance of common language usage in authoritative dictionaries presenting such lexicon <b>items</b> as <b>standardised</b> Afrikaans in a rapidly changing society. Intense language transformation is present in the Afrikaans lexicon. Observing the presence of intense change in the most conservative register of a language, that of religion emphasises the intensity of the social and linguistic powers at work in Afrikaans...|$|R
