2500|$|Fayette Avery McKenzie was {{the first}} American {{sociologist}} to specialize in Indian affairs. McKenzie chose the American Indian people as {{the subject of his}} doctoral dissertation at the University of Pennsylvania, and decided to live among them [...] "long enough {{to get a sense of}} what the Indians problem in the concrete was." [...] In September 1903, McKenzie, then 32 years old, applied to the Indian Service and accepted a position as principal teacher at the Wind River Indian Reservation Boarding School at Fort Washakie, Wyoming. In his position as Principal Teacher on the Wind River Boarding School, shared by the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes, McKenzie oversaw instruction of approximately 170 Indian children and taught the most advanced students reading, writing, and arithmetic. As was often the case at Indian boarding schools, teachers performed several functions outside the classroom, and in addition to his teaching and <b>supervisory</b> <b>responsibilities,</b> McKenzie played the organ and piano at chapel and church services, led a band, occasionally supervised the dining hall and fed the school's chickens. By all accounts, McKenzie was well liked by both students and faculty.

At Wind River Reservation, McKenzie began a lifelong association Rev. Sherman Coolidge, an Arapaho Episcopalian priest and missionary. McKenzie often invited Rev. Coolidge and Dr. Charles Eastman to lecture in his classes at Ohio State University and at public events. They also shared their ideas about forming the first national association run by Indians for Indians.|$|E
