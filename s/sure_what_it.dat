Two songs from those sessions, [...] "Moving Targets" [...] and [...] "Eyes Like Pearls", were included on What Were You Hoping For?. After setting up his own label in 2009, Hunt began a new process for What Were You Hoping For?, writing and recording songs for 10 months. In an interview for the Chicago Tribune, {{he said of his}} expectations for the album's recording: [...] "I really wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would wind up being sonically. I love Bach cello suites, I love punk music, I love old blues, negro spiritual quartets, Muddy Waters' 'You Need Love.' There is a simplicity but also a bite that connects all that music, from the growl in the cello to the timbre in Muddy's voice. I wanted simple music, but with bite, over which I could lay my lyrical shenanigans." ...|$|E

A writer of BBC Online described her rendition as [...] "moving". On May 28, 2012, Fatai Veamatahau sang [...] "Ave Maria" [...] on The Voice (Australia). Simon Holt of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that [...] "she has a voice which brought tears to many eyes", including coach and mentor Seal's. Coach Joel Madden said: [...] "I have to be respectful. That was a very spiritual performance. I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was like for people at home, but that felt electric in here". A reviewer for Take 40 Australia called it a [...] "rousing version". Veamatahau's version peaked at number 25 on the Australian Singles Chart for the week of June 10, 2012.|$|E

500|$|... 1602, Nick Lowe and Joe Quesada, {{approached}} Gaiman after Quesada became Marvel's Editor in Chief {{with the}} intent for Gaiman {{to work on a}} project for Marvel. Gaiman eventually agreed to write a Marvel comic in August 2001, although he was not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would contain. When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, Gaiman decided {{that he did not want}} planes, skyscrapers, bombs or guns in his comic. [...] "I didn't want it to be a war story, and I didn't want to write a story in which might made right – or in which might made anything." [...] On a trip to Venice soon after, Gaiman was struck by how the [...] "past seemed very close at hand"; he returned from the trip knowing the story he wanted to tell. The time was chosen because [...] "it was a nice place to set the story. It gave me America and it gave me a lot of things that I wanted in terms of the way the world was changing. It also gave me the sense of wonder and magic." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Breakout" [...] {{was written}} by Ted Bruner, in {{collaboration}} with Trey Vittetoe and Gina Schock of the Go-Go's. It was first recorded by American pop singer Katy Perry, for her second album One of the Boys (2008), though it was never included for the album and was passed on to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals. Like most songs on Breakout, Cyrus wrote [...] "7 Things" [...] while traveling on the Best of Both Worlds Tour, reflecting on her numerous emotions about an ex-boyfriend. She claimed her {{use of the word}} [...] "hate" [...] demonstrated how furious she was, at the time. Originally, [...] "7 Things" [...] was more [...] "soft and nice" [...] but Cyrus says she [...] "went nuts" [...] during the recording process and gave the song a harder sound. She decided to record a cover version of Cyndi Lauper's [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] from the album She's So Unusual (1983), after speaking with Lauper at the 50th Grammy Awards. The two singers were conversing about music, when Lauper stated, [...] "Well, don't be scared of anything. People waste their lives being scared. Lasso the moon. But don't do it because someone tells you it's the right idea." [...] Cyrus believed Lauper's saying encompassed the direction she wanted to take Breakout, ergo she covered [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun". However, she desired for the cover to be completely different from other covers of [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] she heard. She described the process as [...] "almost [...] to relearn the song." [...] About the finished product, Cyrus said, [...] "When you listen to the song, it's, like, you're not even <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. It's something completely new." [...] "Full Circle" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Scott Cutler, and Anne Preven about Cyrus' relationship with Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers. [...] "It's about two people. They're always gonna come back together no matter what anyone says, the bad people that try to keep you apart", Cyrus said of the song's concept.|$|E

[...] IGN rated the show 6 out of 10 on their website. Seth Amitin said, [...] "it looks like Hell on Wheels still isn't <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> going to be. The Swede is an extraordinary addition to the series, though, and hopefully the series continues to build and progress as it goes on." [...] TV Fanatic's Sean McKenna approved of the episode: [...] "Thankfully, 'Immoral Mathematics' managed to focus itself on one central storyline and scatter a few smaller ones throughout. It chugged along at a much quicker pace and kept me interested for pretty much the entire episode." ...|$|R

50|$|Subjective {{impressions}} of tempo differences between different languages and dialects {{are difficult to}} substantiate with scientific data.

Consequently, {{it is likely that}} a Japanese speaker can produce more syllables in their language per second than an English speaker can in theirs.
