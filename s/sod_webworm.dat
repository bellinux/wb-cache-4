40|$|The term “sod webworm” {{refers to}} an insect complex of more than twenty {{different}} grass-infesting species. Adult <b>sod</b> <b>webworms</b> are pyralid moths, but are more {{commonly referred to as}} “snout moths” because their mouthparts are projected forward (Fig. 1). <b>Sod</b> <b>webworms</b> are distributed through the U. S., and at least seven different species occur in Utah (Table 1) ...|$|R
50|$|To be {{considered}} a serious infestation of <b>sod</b> <b>webworms,</b> 12 larvae must {{be found in a}} 0.1 m2 area. To test this, hollow pans are placed with a pyrethrum or detergent drench and allowed to sit for 10 minutes, then the larvae in the area are counted. During peak growing periods, the grass will often be able to recover by itself and not show serious damage. For high-end turf that cannot show any damage or serious infestations, predators of the <b>sod</b> <b>webworms</b> must be attracted, including birds and insect predators, such as ground beetles, robber flies, and predatory wasps. The larva is also prone to infection from microorganisms such as Beauveria bassiana and Nosema (Microsporidia). Parasitic nematodes such as Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis heliothidis can also infect <b>sod</b> <b>webworms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The genus Crambus {{includes}} around 155 {{species of}} moths {{in the family}} Crambidae distributed globally. The adult stages are called snout moths (a name shared {{with the rest of}} the family Crambidae), while the larvae of Crambus and the related genus Herpetogramma are the <b>sod</b> <b>webworms,</b> which can damage grasses.|$|R

5000|$|Herpetogramma phaeopteralis, the dusky herpetogramma or {{tropical}} <b>sod</b> <b>webworm,</b> is a moth in the Crambidae family. It {{was described}} by Guenée in 1854.|$|E
50|$|Chrysoteuchia topiarius, the topiary grass-veneer moth, {{subterranean}} <b>sod</b> <b>webworm</b> or cranberry girdler, is a moth of the Crambidae family. It {{is found}} in most of North America.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sod</b> <b>webworms</b> have a bivoltine {{life cycle}} with four stages: egg, larva, pupa and imago (adult). They overwinter as larvae {{in their final}} or {{penultimate}} instar in the thatch or soil. With the coming of warmer weather, the larvae will pupate, and moths will appear in late spring or early summer. The first generation of eggs is laid in June, with larvae appearing in June and lasting until July. Adult moths appear from July until August. Under favorable conditions, a second generation will occur, with the adult stage laying eggs in early October.|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} the most frequent unfavorable natural phenomena in the Republic of Moldova, such as drought, hot dry-winds and strong winds, dust storms, hail, frost, glaze ice, invasion of <b>sod</b> <b>webworms</b> and others. Additionally it presents a number of methods for reduction of their damaging influence {{on the results of}} agricultural activity. The article showcases the devastating effect of webworms on the seeding of agricultural crop yield in 1975 and the coping measures undertaken in those years. In 2003, {{as a result of an}} unusual combination of natural and climate factors, a great damage was done to the seeding of agricultural crops. Similarly, abnormal heat during the summer of 2007 caused a disastrously low crop yield on the territory of the republic...|$|R
50|$|Since crambids are {{relatively}} common throughout human settlements, the moths tend to affect crops and gardens, whether harmfully, beneficially or harmlessly. Beneficial crambids include the water hyacinth moth (Niphograpta albiguttalis), {{used to control}} its host (Eichhornia crassipes), the water veneer (Acentria ephemerella), a biocontrol agent used against Eurasian watermilfoil), and the bamboo borer (Omphisa fuscidentalis), of which the caterpillars are used for human consumption (see entomophagy). The mint moth (Pyrausta aurata) {{is an example of}} a harmless crambid. Crambid larvae are typically stem borers in plants of the grass family. As this family contains many important crops, some Crambidae species achieve pest status. The European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis is perhaps the best known; introduced to the United States in the early 1900s, it is now widespread in all but the westernmost states. Other pest species include the spotted stalk borer (Chilo partellus), the Asiatic rice borer (Chilo suppressalis), <b>sod</b> <b>webworms</b> (Crambus spp.), Duponchelia fovealis, the sugarcane borer (Diatraea saccharalis), bean pod borers (Maruca spp.), the rice white stemborer (Scirpophaga innotata), the southwestern corn borer (Diatraea grandiosella), and the grape leaffolder (Desmia maculalis).|$|R
50|$|Fissicrambus mutabilis, the {{changeable}} grass-veneer or striped <b>sod</b> <b>webworm,</b> is a moth of the Crambidae family. It {{is found}} from Quebec to Florida, west to Texas and Illinois and north to Ontario.|$|E
50|$|Agriphila vulgivagellus, the {{vagabond}} crambus or vagabond <b>sod</b> <b>webworm,</b> is a moth of the Crambidae family. It is found from Quebec and New England to Florida, west to Texas and north to Alberta.|$|E
50|$|After he was married, in 1939 {{and moved}} to West Los Angeles, Bohart was doing {{research}} and teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles. There Bohart was researching the <b>sod</b> <b>webworm</b> that was infesting his own front yard lawn from 1938 to 1941.|$|E
50|$|Sod webworms {{were first}} {{recognized}} as a serious pest of lawns and golf courses during the drought of 1928-1934 that affected most of the United States. Unlike {{many of the other}} more destructive turfgrass pests, the <b>sod</b> <b>webworm</b> is native to the United States and was not introduced.|$|E
50|$|Most damage {{occurs during}} the first instar, when the <b>sod</b> <b>webworm</b> only feeds on the foliage of the turfgrass. Damage is often seen as a small area of leaves that are yellow to brown. Sod webworms {{themselves}} will not be seen because of their nocturnal nature. During the day, the <b>sod</b> <b>webworm</b> {{can be found in}} its burrow {{in the center of the}} damaged area. Even though damage can be an eyesore, it does not hurt the turf because no damage is done to the crown of the plant. In closely mown turf and drought conditions, damage is more severe than in poorly maintained turf. In closely mown turf, symptoms will appear more quickly and prominently. During drought conditions, damage is more severe because the damage is often not seen until rainfall occurs.|$|E
50|$|Agriphila ruricolella, the Lesser Vagabond <b>Sod</b> <b>Webworm,</b> is a moth in the Crambidae family. It was {{described}} by Zeller in 1863. It is found in North America, {{where it has been}} recorded from Quebec and Maine to South Carolina, west to Arizona and north to Alberta. The habitat consists of grasslands, weedy areas, fields and cultivated areas.|$|E
