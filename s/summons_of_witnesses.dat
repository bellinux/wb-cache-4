50|$|Laws {{governing}} criminal {{trials are}} applied, with necessary changes, to the <b>summoning</b> <b>of</b> <b>witnesses</b> and the giving of evidence. Section 203 of the CPA applies, with its privilege against giving self-incriminating answers.|$|R
500|$|Also in 1957, the Supreme Court {{ruled on}} the case of Watkins v. United States, curtailing the power of HUAC to punish {{uncooperative}} witnesses by finding them in contempt of Congress. Justice Warren wrote in the decision: [...] "The mere <b>summoning</b> <b>of</b> a <b>witness</b> and compelling him to testify, against his will, about his beliefs, expressions or associations is a measure of governmental interference. And when those forced revelations concern matters that are unorthodox, unpopular, or even hateful to the general public, the reaction in the life <b>of</b> the <b>witness</b> may be disastrous." ...|$|R
50|$|Both sides <b>summoned</b> {{hundreds}} <b>of</b> <b>witnesses</b> {{and some}} <b>of</b> their comments were contradictory. Defense questioned kumar's sister Jyotirmayi Debi, {{who supported the}} claimant and stated that the claimant had various family characteristics and that the claimant did speak Bengali. The plaintiff's side, in turn, closely questioned Bibhabati Debi, who denied she saw any resemblance between her dead husband and the claimant. Ananda Kumari, widow {{of one of the}} other kumars, claimed that the kumar had been able to speak English and write in Bengali, neither of which the claimant could do. However, the letters that were presented as evidence of this were found to be forgeries.|$|R

During the events of Kingsglaive, Ravus attends the treaty-signing as part of Niflheim's delegation, subsequently participating in the empire's invasion of Lucis. He attempts to wield the Ring of the Lucii, but it rejects him and burns his arm. Upon the death of General Glauca, Ravus is promoted to high commander of Niflheim's armies, with his maimed arm replaced by a Magitek prosthesis. While appearing antagonistic, it is revealed that he merely deemed Noctis unworthy and resented the fact that Lunafreya's work on his behalf was killing her. After Lunafreya asks him to give Noctis Regis' sword, Ravus rebels against the empire and is sentenced to death for both this and his failure to contain the <b>summoning</b> <b>of</b> Leviathan, <b>witnessing</b> Niflheim's capital Gralea falling to Daemons. He is then killed and resurrected as a Daemon by Ardyn, before being defeated by the party.|$|R

50|$|Tiberius {{was forced}} to order an investigation, and after briefly hearing both sides, decided to defer {{the case to the}} senate. Tiberius made no effort to conceal his sentiments: the Pisones were {{longtime}} supporters of the Claudians, with their support going back to the early days of Octavian. A public trial was held, and Tiberius made allowances for Piso to <b>summon</b> <b>witnesses</b> <b>of</b> all social orders, including slaves, and he was given more time to plea than the prosecution, but it made no difference: before the sentencing, Piso had died. He committed suicide, though Tacitus supposes that Tiberius may have had him murdered, fearing his own implication in Germanicus' death.|$|R
5|$|Piso {{was rumored}} to have been {{responsible}} for his death and with accusations coming in it wasn't long before the well known accuser, Lucius Fulcinius Trio, brought charges against him. The Pisones were longtime supporters of the Claudians, and had allied themselves with Octavian early on. The continued support of the Pisones and his own friendship to Piso made him hesitant to hear the case himself. After briefly hearing both sides, Tiberius deferred the case to the Senate, making no effort to hide his deep anger toward Piso. Tiberius made allowances for Piso to <b>summon</b> <b>witnesses</b> <b>of</b> all social orders, including slaves, and he was given more time to plea than the prosecutors, but it made no difference: before the trial was over Piso died ostensibly by suicide, but Tacitus supposes Tiberius may have had him murdered before he could implicate the emperor in Germanicus' death.|$|R
