40|$|Charu Shukla, Radhika Basheer Department of Psychiatry, VA Boston Healthcare System, Harvard Medical School, West Roxbury, MA, USA Abstract: Sleep {{and energy}} balance are {{essential}} for health. The two processes act in concert to regulate central and peripheral homeostasis. During <b>sleep,</b> <b>energy</b> is conserved due to suspended activity, movement, and sensory responses, and is redirected to restore and replenish proteins and their assemblies into cellular structures. During wakefulness, various energy-demanding activities lead to hunger. Thus, hunger promotes arousal, and subsequent feeding, followed by satiety that promotes sleep via changes in neuroendocrine or neuropeptide signals. These signals overlap with circuits of sleep-wakefulness, feeding, and energy expenditure. Here, we will briefly review the literature that describes the interplay between the circadian system, sleep-wake, and feeding-fasting cycles that are needed to maintain energy balance and a healthy metabolic profile. In doing so, we describe the neuroendocrine, hormonal/peptide signals that integrate sleep and feeding behavior with energy metabolism.

40|$|Purpose: In persons {{completing}} exhaustive daily exercise, <b>sleep</b> and <b>energy</b> restriction {{have been}} highlighted as {{risk factors for}} hypothermia in cold environments. The present study therefore sought {{to determine the effect}} of sleep deprivation (SDEP), with and without energy restriction, on the thermal response to cold. Methods: In a random order, ten recreationally active men (mean ± SD: age 25 ± 6 years, body fat 17 ± 5 %) completed three 53 h trials: a control (CON: 436 min/night sleep), SDEP (0 min sleep), and <b>sleep</b> deprivation and <b>energy</b> restriction (SDEP + ER: 0 min sleep and 10 % daily energy requirements). Exhaustive exercise was completed after 5 and 29 h. After 53 h participants completed a semi-nude seated cold air test (CAT, 0 °C), for 4 h or until rectal core temperature (T re) reached 36 °C. Results: Two nights of <b>sleep</b> and <b>energy</b> restriction did not impair the thermal response to cold (T re, CON 36. 15 ± 0. 20 °C, SDEP 36. 30 ± 0. 15 °C, SDEP + ER 36. 25 ± 0. 20 °C, P = 0. 25). Rewarming was also similar as indicated by 1 h post-CAT T re (P = 0. 78). In contrast, perceived thermal discomfort during the initial hour of the CAT tended to be greater after SDEP and SDEP + ER (P ≤ 0. 1). Conclusion: <b>Sleep</b> and <b>energy</b> restriction, at least as evaluated within this experiment, should be considered minimal risk factors for hypothermia. The greater perception of cold discomfort at the same body temperature suggests that <b>sleep</b> and <b>energy</b> restriction may actually reduce cold injury risk, as people are likely to engage earlier in normal behavioral cold adaptation...|$|R

We propose a unique approach of using a power gating switch (PGS) in ultra-low regimes. Unlike the conventional manner of using PGSs, our optimization suggests using minimal-sized PGSs with a slightly higher to compensate for voltage drop across the PGS. In SPICE simulations, this reduces total energy consumption by compared to conventional approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed optimization is also confirmed by measurements taken from an ultra-low power microprocessor. Additionally, the feasibility of using minimal PGSs in ultra-low regimes is in-vestigated using SPICE simulations and silicon measurements.

40|$|Context: Peripheral {{and central}} endocannabinoids and cognate acylethanolamides (AEs) may play {{important}} but distinct roles in regulating energy balance. Objective: We hypothesized that in humans central/peripheral endocannabinoids are differently associated with adiposity and energy expenditure and differ by race. Design: We examined associations of arachindonoylethanolamide, 2 -arachidonoylglycerol, palmitoylethanolamide, and oleoylethanolamide (OEA) assayed in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with race, adiposity, and energy expenditure. Setting/Participants: In this monitored clinical inpatient study, CSF {{was obtained by}} lumbar puncture in 27 individuals (12 Caucasian, 11 American Indian, and four African-American). Twenty-four hour and <b>sleep</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure were measured by indirect calorimetry in a respiratory chamber. Main Outcome Measure: Samples were analyzed from a previous study originally designed to test a blood-brain barrier leptin transport deficit in human obesity. Results: CSF (but not peripheral) 2 - arachidonoylglycerol was significantly increased in American Indians compared with Caucasians (18. 48 ± 6. 17 vs. 10. 62 ± 4. 58 pmol/ml, P < 0. 01). In the whole group, peripheral AEs were positively but in CSF negatively associated with adiposity. However, in multivariate models adjusted for the other peripheral and CSF AEs, peripheral arachindonoylethanolamide was the only AE significantly associated with adiposity. Interestingly, CSF OEA concentrations were positively associated with adjusted 24 hour and <b>sleep</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure (r = 0. 47, P < 0. 05; r = 0. 42, P < 0. 05), but peripheral OEA was not. Conclusions: These data indicate a central alteration of the endocannabinoid system in American Indians and furthermore show that AEs in both compartments play an important but distinct role in human energy balance regulation.

Heterogeneous {{networks}} (HetNets) are proposed {{in order to}} meet the increasing demand for next generation cellular wireless networks, but they also increase the energy consumption of the base stations. In this thesis, an activity management algorithm for improving the energy efficiency of HetNets is proposed. A smart sleep strategy is employed for the operator deployed pico base stations to enter sleep and active modes. According to that strategy, when the number of users exceeds the turn on threshold, the pico node becomes active and when the number of users drop below the turn off threshold, it goes into sleep mode. Mobile users dynamically enter and leave the cells, triggering the activation and deactivation of pico base stations. The performance of the system is examined for three different cellular network architectures: cell on edge (COE), uniformly distributed cells (UDC) and macro cell only network (MoNet). Two different user distributions are considered: uniform and hotspot.

Davis Major: Nursing Degree: Doctor of Philosophy Daily {{variation}} in human processes and behaviors {{has been identified}} for centuries. Study of these circadian rhythms demonstrates their role in human health. Sickness behaviors include alterations in affect, <b>sleep</b> quality and <b>energy.</b> The study {{of the relationship between}} circadian rhythms has been limited to isolated rhythms. The role of temporal relationships among rhythms has received little attention. Sickness behaviors are prevalent in many disorders including depression, cancer, and autoimmune disorders. Two hormones that have been shown {{to play a role in}} the manifestation of sickness behaviors are cortisol and estradiol. To date the role of the relationship between cortisol and estradiol circadian rhythms and sickness behaviors remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to explore the temporal relationship between the rhythms of cortisol and estradiol and its relationship to sickness behaviors. It was hypothesized that a cortisol-estradiol phase angle difference (PAD) would exist that would correlate with optimal affect, <b>sleep</b> quality and <b>energy.</b> A small scale, comparative, correlational design was used to test the hypothesis. A sample of twenty-three university women (11 morning-types and 12 evening-types) between the ages of twenty to thirty-five were recruited from an urban university. Salivary samples were collected every two hours for a twenty-four hour period. Subjective measures of affect, <b>sleep</b> quality and <b>energy</b> were recorded. Salivary samples were assayed for cortisol and estradiol levels and fitted to a cosinor model with ultradian harmonics for each participant. Relationships between the cortisol-estradiol PAD and affect, <b>sleep</b> quality and <b>energy</b> measures were evaluated using a second degree polynomial equation. Results showed a significant correlation in affect measures (p 3 ̆c 0. 05), but not <b>sleep</b> quality or <b>energy.</b> An optimal PAD was identified for affect at 3. 6 hours. The phase relationship between cortisol and estradiol may play a role in the development of alterations in affect which manifest in many disorders. These findings are based on a small homogeneous sample of university women. More research is needed in a larger, more heterogeneous group of women...|$|R

It contains eight items: dyspnea, anxiety, depressed mood, <b>sleep,</b> <b>energy,</b> daily activities, social activities and sexual life. Psychometric properties were assessed during a clinical trial that evaluated the impact of tiotropium on HRQoL of COPD patients. These included the determination of structure, internal consistency reliability, concurrent validity with the St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), test – retest reliability, clinical validity and responsiveness to change over two weeks. Minimal important difference (MID) was calculated; cumulative response curves (CRC) were based on the dyspnea item. Psychometric analyses showed that VSRQ structure was unidimensional. The questionnaire demonstrated good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0. 84), good concurrent validity with SGRQ (Spearman = − 0. 70) and clinical validity, good test-retest reproducibility (ICC = 0. 77), and satisfactory responsiveness (standardized response mean = 0. 57; Guyatt’s statistic = 0. 63). MID was 3. 4; CRC median value of the ‘minimally improved’ patients was 3. 5.

40|$|Depressed mood is {{a common}} {{psychiatric}} complaint in persons with HIV/AIDS, with a meta-analysis indicating that the rates of depression within this group may {{be as high as}} double that of the general population. Depression may result from a biological diathesis to mood disorders, a physiological reaction to a medical illness or its treatment, and/or a psychological reaction to challenging life circumstances. Associated symptoms include <b>sleep,</b> <b>energy</b> and appetite disturbances; social withdrawal; diminished capacity to experience pleasure; diminished concentration; feelings of worthlessness, shame and guilt; and recurrent thoughts of death, including suicidal ideation. The emotionally and physically painful state of major depression is associated with decreased antiretroviral adherence and poorer HIV/AIDS disease outcomes. Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported with several of the medications taken by patients with HIV/AIDS, including lamivudine, zidovudine, interferon and, most notably, efavirenz. However, data from several sources demonstrate that neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with efavirenz use are generally transient, with onset early after treatment initiation, peaking after one week and decreasing over the first one to four months of treatment. Recent comparative studies have not found elevated incident rates of major depression in patients treated with efavirenz, but they have confirmed the typical neuropsychiatric symptoms reported in earlier open-label studies and case reports.

40|$|AbstractThe energy {{allocation}} (EA) model defines behavioral {{strategies that}} optimize the temporal utilization {{of energy to}} maximize reproductive success. This model proposes that all species of the animal kingdom share a universal sleep function that shunts waking energy utilization toward sleep-dependent biological investment. For endotherms, REM sleep evolved to enhance energy appropriation for somatic and CNS-related processes by eliminating thermoregulatory defenses and skeletal muscle tone. Alternating REM with NREM <b>sleep</b> conserves <b>energy</b> by decreasing the need for core body temperature defense. Three EA phenotypes are proposed: sleep–wake cycling, torpor, and continuous (or predominant) wakefulness. Each phenotype carries inherent costs and benefits. Sleep–wake cycling downregulates specific biological processes in waking and upregulates them in <b>sleep,</b> thereby decreasing <b>energy</b> demands imposed by wakefulness, reducing cellular infrastructure requirements, and resulting in overall energy conservation. Torpor achieves the greatest energy savings, but critical biological operations are compromised. Continuous wakefulness maximizes niche exploitation, but endures the greatest energy demands.

40|$|Health is {{a multidimensional}} landscape. If we just {{consider}} the host, {{there are many}} outputs that interest us: evolutionary fitness determining parameters like fecundity, survival and pathogen clearance as well as medically important health parameters like <b>sleep,</b> <b>energy</b> stores and appetite. Hosts {{use a variety of}} effector pathways to fight infections and these effectors are brought to bear differentially. Each pathogen causes a different disease as they have distinct virulence factors and niches; they each warp the health landscape in unique ways. Therefore, mutations affecting immunity can have complex phenotypes and distinct effects on each pathogen. Here we describe how two components of the fly’s immune response, melanization and phagocytosis, contribute to the health landscape generated by the transcription factor ets 21 c (CG 2914) and its putative effector, the signaling molecule wntD (CG 8458). To probe the landscape, we infect with two pathogens: Listeria monocytogenes, which primarily lives intracellularly, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is an extracellular pathogen. Using the diversity of phenotypes generated by these mutants, we propose that survival during a L. monocytogenes infection is mediated by a combination of two host mechanisms: phagocytic activity and melanization; while survival during a S. pneumoniae infection is determined by phagocytic activity. In addition, increased phagocytic activity is beneficial during S. pneumoniae infection but detrimental during L. monocytogenes infection, demonstrating an inherent trade-off in the immune response...|$|E

CONCLUSION [...] Self reported damp housing and ill health in adults were strongly associated, most noticeably among people in non-manual social classes living in owner occupied housing. The association met many of the epidemiological criteria necessary for suggesting causality: alternative explanations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Rodent {{experiments}} have emphasized a role of central fatty acid (FA) species, such as oleic acid, in regulating peripheral glucose and energy metabolism. Thus, {{we hypothesized that}} central FAs are related to peripheral glucose regulation and energy expenditure in humans. To test this we measured FA species profiles in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of 32 individuals who stayed in our clinical inpatient unit for 6 days. Body composition was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and glucose regulation by an oral glucose test (OGTT) followed by measurements of 24 hour (24 EE) and <b>sleep</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure (SLEEP) as well as respiratory quotient (RQ) in a respiratory chamber. CSF was obtained via lumbar punctures; FA concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. As expected, FA concentrations were higher in plasma compared to CSF. Individuals with high concentrations of CSF very-long-chain saturated FAs had lower rates of SLEEP. In the plasma moderate associations of these FAs with higher 24 EE were observed. Moreover, CSF monounsaturated long-chain FA (palmitoleic and oleic acid) concentrations were associated with lower RQs and lower glucose area under the curve during the OGTT. Thus, FAs in the CSF strongly correlated with peripheral metabolic traits. These physiological parameters were most specific to long-chain monounsaturated (C 16 : 1, C 18 : 1) and very-long-chain saturated (C 24 : 0, C 26 : 0) FAs. Conclusions: Together with previous animal experiments these initial cross-sectional huma...|$|E

5000|$|... 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy, or molly) is a euphoriant, empathogen, and {{stimulant}} of the amphetamine class. Briefly {{used by some}} psychotherapists as {{an adjunct}} to therapy, the drug became popular recreationally and the DEA listed MDMA as a Schedule I controlled substance, prohibiting most medical studies and applications. MDMA is known for its entactogenic properties. The stimulant effects of MDMA include hypertension, anorexia (appetite loss), euphoria, social disinhibition, insomnia (enhanced wakefulness/inability to <b>sleep),</b> improved <b>energy,</b> increased arousal, and increased perspiration, among others. MDMA differs from most stimulants in that its primary pharmacological effect is on the neurotransmitter serotonin rather than dopamine, or norepinephrine.
