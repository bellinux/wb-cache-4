The diameter at breast height (DBH) and the merchantable height are used to determine the total volume. Difficulties occur when estimating the form class of the tree in question. The Mesavage and Girard form classes used to classify the trees to decide which volume table should be used. These volume tables are also based on different log rules such a Scribner, Doyle, and International ¼” scale. In order to be effective, the proper form class must be selected as well as accurate DBH and height measurements.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Individual tree mapping in {{the forest}} is usually done by several {{techniques}} such as the sequential target and point origin mapping. Generally, the estimation of <b>standing</b> <b>timber</b> <b>volume</b> operation is considered a difficult task as ground survey is expensive. Most of this task is being done {{on the ground and}} {{takes a lot of time}} to be accomplished. However, the use of airborne remote sensing such as the UPM-APSB’s Airborne Imaging Spectrometers for Applications (AISA) that plays its part in Global Positioning System (GPS) could change the way on how tree mapping and <b>standing</b> <b>timber</b> <b>volume</b> estimation are done. The general objective of this study is to map the individual wild A. mangium trees and estimate their <b>standing</b> <b>timber</b> <b>volume</b> using the airborne hyperspectral imaging technique. The specific objectives were to assess the capability of UPM-APSB’s AISA airborne hyperspectral data in mapping A. mangium plantation and estimate its <b>standing</b> <b>timber</b> <b>volume</b> by delineating the individual trees crown areas. The hyperspectral image of A. mangium plan-tation in Lebuh Silikon, UPM in ENVI (. img) format taken on February 2004 was enhanced using the ENVI software. The age of the A. mangium stand was about 30 years old. Results indicated the presence of 29 canopies of A. mangium trees over a 0. 8 ha plot. A single crown or canopy represented a single tree. A set of simple linear regression model for predicting volume from the crown area was developed using the 29 samples of tree crown. The value for r was 0. 801 for this fit of the model, which showed 80. 1 % erratum data could be evaded.

The main purpose of the study is to get an {{explanation}} to why some of the members are passive in their forestry, and how Södra can stimulate them to become more active. To achieve this a questionnaire study was conducted on the members of Södra in the community of Gislaved. The result of the study shows that there are many different factors that influence whether the forest owner is active or not. Examples of those factors are timber prices, the forest owner's objectives and the forest owner's financial situation. The main goal for the forest owners in the survey was to obtain high economic result and to increase the <b>standing</b> <b>timber</b> <b>volume</b> for the next generation.

40|$|Natural {{disturbances}} like wildfire, windthrow {{and insect}} outbreaks are critical drivers of composition, structure and functioning of forest ecosystems. They are strongly climate-sensitive, {{and are thus}} likely to be distinctly affected by climatic changes. Observations across Europe show that in recent decades, forest disturbance regimes have intensified markedly, resulting in a strong increase in damage from wind, bark beetles and wildfires. Climate change is frequently hypothesized as the main driving force behind this intensification, but changes in forest structure and composition associated with management activities such as promoting conifers and increasing <b>standing</b> <b>timber</b> <b>volume</b> (i. e. ‘forest change’) also strongly influence susceptibility to disturbances. Here, we show that from 1958 to 2001, forest change contributed {{in the same order}} of magnitude as climate change to the increase in disturbance damage in Europe's forests. Climate change was the main driver of the increase in area burnt, while changes in forest extent, structure and composition particularly affected the variation in wind and bark beetle damage. For all three disturbance agents, damage was most severe when conducive weather conditions and increased forest susceptibility coincided. We conclude that a continuing trend towards more disturbance-prone conditions is likely for large parts of Europe's forests, and can have strong detrimental effects on forest carbon storage and other ecosystem services. Understanding the interacting drivers of natural disturbance regimes is thus a prerequisite for climate change mitigation and adaptation in forest ecosystem management...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{conservation}} interventions must balance potential trade-offs between multiple ecosystem services. In tropical forests, {{much attention}} {{has focused on}} the extent to which carbon-based conservation provided by REDD+ policies can also mitigate biodiversity conservation. In the nearly one-third of tropical forests that are community owned or managed, conservation strategies must also balance the multiple uses of forest products that support local livelihoods. Although much discussion has focused on policy options, little empirical evidence exists to evaluate the potential for trade-offs among different tropical forest value components. We assessed multiple components of forest value, including tree diversity, carbon stocks, and both timber and nontimber forest product resources, in forest communities across the trinational frontier of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. We installed 69 0. 5 -ha vegetation plots in local communities, and we characterized 15 components of forest value for each plot. Principal components analyses revealed two major axes of forest value, the first of which defined a trade-off between diversity of woody plant communities (taxonomic and functional) versus aboveground biomass and <b>standing</b> <b>timber</b> <b>volume.</b> The second axis described abundance of commercial species, with strong positive loadings for density of timber and nontimber forest products, including Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) and copaiba oil (Copaifera spp.).

40|$|Maps of <b>standing</b> <b>timber</b> <b>volume</b> provide {{valuable}} decision support for forest managers and have therefore {{been the subject}} of recent studies. For map production, field observations are commonly combined with area-wide remote sensing data in order to formulate prediction models, which are then applied over the entire inventory area. The accuracy of such maps has frequently been described by parameters such as the root mean square error of the prediction model. The aim {{of this study was to}} additionally address the accuracy of timber volume classes, which are used to better represent the map predictions. However, the use of constant class intervals neglects the possibility that the precision of the underlying prediction model may not be constant across the entire volume range, resulting in pronounced gradients between class accuracies. This study proposes an optimization technique that automatically identifies a classification scheme which accounts for the properties of the underlying model and the implied properties of the remote sensing support information. We demonstrate the approach in a mountainous study site in Eastern Switzerland covering a forest area of 2000 hectares using a multiple linear regression model approach. A LiDAR-based canopy height model (CHM) provided the auxiliary information; timber volume observations from the latest forest inventory were used for model calibration and map validation. The coefficient of determination (R 2 = 0. 64) and the cross-validated root mean square error (RMSECV = 123. 79 m 3 ha− 1) were only slightly smaller than those of studies in less steep and heterogeneous landscapes.

40|$|Airborne Laser Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) {{has been}} used {{extensively}} for <b>timber</b> <b>volume</b> estimation especially in temperate region. Application of such technology in tropical region specifically in developing countries faces several challenges due to low penetration of laser pulses over tree canopy and relatively low density of point clouds due to the cost constraint. This paper presents a thorough investigation on the capability of ALS data in estimating density of vegetation over Ayer Keroh recreational forest, Melaka, Malaysia. The study area covers about 2 hectare and consists of more than 30 tree species, which dominated by Merawan Siput Jantan (Hopea odorata). The airborne LiDAR data was obtained using the Optech ALTM 3100 in 2009 with a posting density of about 0. 69 point per meter squared. The estimation of forest <b>timber</b> <b>volume</b> involves five main processing stages, i. e. 1) delineation of individual trees, 2) estimation of individual tree diameter at breast height (DBH) based on allometric equation, 3) estimation of crown diameter, 4) estimation of tree height and 5) estimation of <b>timber</b> <b>volume.</b> Individual tree crown segmentation {{is based on the}} inverse watershed (IW) segmentation routine and local maximum (LM) filtering in TreeVaw. Tree height and crown diameter of individual trees are calculated by using canopy height model (CHM) and crown segments. These parameters will be used as input in the allometric equation that is specially developed over tropical region to estimate tree DBH. Based on the estimated DBH, tree height and crown diameter, the <b>timber</b> <b>volume</b> will be calculated at a certain unit area by using a multiplicative method. The final <b>timber</b> <b>volume</b> map is validated using field collected data. In this study, the results are presented as a map of average of <b>timber</b> <b>volume</b> for every one acre in the study area. Correlation between field collected tree height, DBH, crown diameter and <b>timber</b> <b>volume</b> with values extracted based on the LM individual tree delineation are 0. 59, 0. 72, 0. 72 and 0. 79 respectively.
