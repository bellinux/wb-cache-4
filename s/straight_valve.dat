50|$|The NCG system {{resembles a}} simple {{electrical}} plug in appearance. Although {{it is very}} easy to connect and disconnect, this advantage poses a risk since should it be dislodged accidentally. Additionally, its <b>straight</b> <b>valve</b> does not allow for the connection of flowmeters, necessitating the purchase and use of additional equipment.|$|E
40|$|The type {{material}} of seven taxa of Pleurosigma W. Smith were studied, including P. atlanticum Heiden & Kolbe, P. chilense Hustedt & Krasske, P. chilensis var. patagonica Ferrario & Sar, P. indicum Simonsen, P. intermedium W. Smith, P. nubecula W. Smith and P. simonsenii Hasle. All these taxa are mainly {{characterized by a}} straight or almost <b>straight</b> <b>valve</b> outline. The fine morphology of the type specimens is studied and compared with similar taxa, and appropriate taxonomic changes are proposed. The material examined included the lectotypes of P. chilense and P. atlanticum, the holotypes of P. indicum and P. simonsenii from the Friedrich Hustedt Center for Diatom Research (BRM, Germany), the isolectotypes of P. intermedium and P. nubecula from the Van Heurck Collection (BR, Belgium), and the holotype of P. chilensis var. patagonica and {{material of}} P. simonsenii collected in Argentinian coastal waters from the Herbarium of the División Ficología (LPC, Argentina). Based on light and scanning electron microscope analyses, {{it was concluded that}} P. atlanticum, P. chilense, P. indicum, P. intermedium and P. simonsenii are valid species, P. nubecula is a heterotypic synonym of P. intermedium and P. chilensis var. patagonica must be raised to specific rank under the name P. patagonicum (Ferrario & Sar) Sterrenburg & Sar stat. nov. as it differs from P. chilense in the fine morphology of the external central raphe fissures, the valve apex and the areolae near the centre...|$|E
50|$|During the 1990s, motor enthusiasts were modifying 351 Cleveland 2V {{cylinder}} heads (by rerouting the coolant {{exit from the}} block surfaces to the intake manifold surfaces) {{for use in the}} 351W, resulting in the Clevor (combining Cleveland and Windsor). This modification required the use of custom pistons by reason of differing combustion chamber terrain (canted <b>valves</b> vs. <b>straight</b> <b>valves)</b> and intake manifolds. This combination yielded the horsepower potential of the 351C with the ruggedness of the 351W small block and was possible because more 351C 2V {{cylinder heads}} were manufactured than the corresponding engine blocks (the 351M and 400 used the same head as the 351C 2V).|$|R
50|$|To {{be able to}} {{negotiate}} sharp curves, both the first and fifth pairs of coupled wheels of the Reid Tenwheeler locomotive were flangeless. The locomotive used saturated steam and was equipped with Allan <b>straight</b> link <b>valve</b> gear. The trailing Bissel truck was of the Cartazzi type, which allowed the axle some lateral movement.|$|R
50|$|The locomotive's {{trailing}} wheels were positioned {{below the}} firebox. The cylinders were arranged outside the frames, with flat Murdoch's D slide valves arranged at an incline above the cylinders and actuated by Allan <b>straight</b> link <b>valve</b> gear, driven by eccentric sheaves which were {{mounted on a}} return crank. The brakes were actuated by hand screw from the cab. The engine had 4 in thick wooden buffer beams and was equipped with cowcatchers.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Artemisia turanica. They {{create a}} leafy case, {{consisting}} of several leaf pieces, arranged very irregularly. The caudal {{end of the}} case is slightly down-curved, but is sometimes almost <b>straight.</b> The <b>valve</b> is two-sided. The length of the case is 5.5-6.5 mm and it is yellow or light chocolate-brown in color, although the caudal part is much darker and brownish. Larvae can found {{in the beginning of}} June and (after diapause) in May.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} used {{saturated steam}} and {{was equipped with}} Allan <b>straight</b> link <b>valve</b> gear. The trailing Bissel truck was of the Cartazzi type that allowed the axle some lateral movement. In order to negotiate sharp curves, both the first and fifth sets of coupled wheels were flangeless, but since the blind trailing coupled wheels {{had a tendency to}} derail while reversing, particularly over points, their tyre width was later increased from 6 in to 7 in. In 1912, after the establishment of the South African Railways, the surviving unmodified NGR locomotives were designated Class H.|$|R
5000|$|Globe valves are {{typically}} two-port valves, although three port valves are also produced mostly in straight-flow configuration. Ports are {{openings in the}} body for fluid flowing in or out. The two ports may be oriented straight {{across from each other}} or anywhere on the body, or oriented at an angle (such as a 90°). [...] Globe valves with ports at such an angle are called angle globe valves. Globe valves are mainly used for corrosive or high viscous fluids which solidify at room temperature. This is because <b>straight</b> <b>valves</b> are designed so that the outlet pipe is in line with the inlet pipe and the fluid has a good chance of staying there in the case of horizontal piping. In the case of angle valves, the outlet pipe is directed towards the bottom. This allows the fluid to drain off. In turn, this prevents clogging and/or corrosion of the valve components over a period of time.A globe valve can also have a body {{in the shape of a}} [...] "Y". This will allow the construction of the <b>valve</b> to be <b>straight</b> at the bottom as opposed to the conventional pot type construction (to arrange bottom seat) in case of other valves. This will again allow the fluid to pass through without difficulty and minimizes fluid clogging/corrosion in the long term.|$|R
50|$|To {{negotiate}} sharp curves, {{both the}} first and fifth pairs of coupled wheels were flangeless. The cylinders were arranged outside the plate frame, while the Richardson balanced type slide valves were placed between the frames. The locomotive used saturated steam and was equipped with Allan <b>straight</b> link <b>valve</b> gear, which was reversed by hand-wheel and quick screw gear. Allan valve gear was chosen chiefly because it required less space than the more usual Stephenson lifting link gear and was simpler in construction. The trailing Bissel truck was of the Cartazzi type which allowed the axle some lateral movement.|$|R
60|$|Artillery marks {{a higher}} stage than the sling and the stone. Just so, in many plants, a step {{higher in the}} {{evolutionary}} scale as regards the method of dispersion, the capsule itself bursts open explosively, and scatters its contents to the four winds of heaven. Such plants {{may be said to}} discharge their grains on the principle of the bow and arrow. The balsam is a familiar example of this startling mode of moving to fresh fields and pastures new: its capsule consists of five long <b>straight</b> <b>valves,</b> which break asunder elastically the moment they are touched, when fully ripe, and shed their seeds on all sides, like so many small bombshells. Our friend the squirting cucumber, which served as the prime text for this present discourse, falls into somewhat the same category, though in other ways it rather resembles the true succulent fruits, and belongs, indeed, to the same family as the melon, the gourd, the pumpkin, and the vegetable-marrow, almost all of which are edible and in every way fruit-like. Among English weeds, the little bittercress that grows on dry walls and hedge-banks forms an excellent example of the same device. Village children love to touch the long, ripe, brown capsules on the top with one timid finger, and then jump away, half laughing, half terrified, when the mild-looking little plant goes off suddenly with a small bang and shoots its grains like a catapult point-blank in their faces.|$|R
5000|$|By its {{introduction}} at the 1954 French GP the [...] (76.0×68.8 mm) desmodromic <b>valves</b> <b>straight</b> 8 delivered [...] The W196 {{was the only}} F1 car with such advanced fuel technology, giving it a considerable advantage over the other carburetted engines. Variable length inlet tracts were experimented with and four wheel drive considered. An eventual [...] at 10,000 rpm was targeted for the 2.5-litre F1 motor.|$|R
5000|$|The small-block {{engine that}} was {{identified}} as the Windsor engine {{was introduced in the}} 1962 Ford Fairlane. Displacing 221 cuin L, it was designed to save weight, using thin-wall casting with a block that does not extend below the centerline of the crankshaft. The engine uses a separate aluminum timing chain cover, which differentiates it from the later 335-series Cleveland engines that use an integrated timing cover. All Windsor engines use two-valve-per-cylinder heads, with [...] "2V" [...] and [...] "4V" [...] designations indicating the number of barrels (or venturi) in the carburetor. The valves are in-line and use <b>straight</b> six-bolt <b>valve</b> covers. Coolant is routed into the block by the intake manifold.|$|R
50|$|Designed by T. C. Pullinger from Darracq, Sunbeam and Humber with Fred Neale from Hillman, {{and heavily}} {{influenced}} by the Fiat 501, the 10/20 used a <b>straight</b> four, side <b>valve</b> engine of 1460 cc driving the rear wheels through either a three or four speed gearbox in unit with the engine. Suspension was by semi elliptic leaf springs at the front and quarter elliptic springs at the rear.|$|R
5000|$|The Allan <b>straight</b> link <b>valve</b> gear (invented by Alexander Allan in 1855) {{combined}} {{the features of}} the Stephenson and Gooch gears. The reversing and cut-off functions were achieved by simultaneously raising the radius rod and lowering the link or vice versa. As with the Gooch gear, this saved space but the Allan gear gave performance closer to that of the Stephenson. Moreover, the straight expansion link simplified manufacture. Once again, the Allan gear was not often used in the UK but fairly common on the Continent. Notable UK examples are the GWR 1361 and 1366 classes, and narrow gauge locomotives produced by George England (e.g. [...] "Prince" [...] & [...] "Palmerston" [...] in preservation on the Ffestiniog Railway) and Fletcher-Jennings (No 1 [...] "Tallyllyn" [...] & No 2 [...] "Dolgoch" [...] in preservation on the Talyllyn Railway).|$|R
50|$|The Vienna horn uses {{a unique}} form of double-cylinder valve {{associated}} with the Viennese firm Uhlmann of the 1840s known as a pumpenvalve. A pumpenvalve {{is similar to the}} standard piston valve, but it is not pushed directly inward. Instead, long push-rods reach across to each lever key (as with rotary valves), allowing either a fast or slow change in the valve, by lever speed. The pumpenvalve allows the air to flow <b>straight</b> when the <b>valves</b> are not actuated. When a valve is engaged, each cylinder redirects the air stream 90 degrees in one bend, lessening the resistance felt by the player. This type of valve {{is one of the many}} contributing factors to the liquid legato that is one of the trademarks of the Viennese school. However, the indirect linkage between the fingers and the valves via can make the action slow and therefore make quick technical passages more difficult for the player.|$|R
