50|$|The holiday {{is one of}} the Shalosh Regalim, {{the three}} Biblical pilgrimage festivals.

The Torah mandates the seven-week Counting of the Omer, beginning {{on the second day of}} Passover, to be immediately followed by <b>Shavuot.</b> This counting of days and weeks is understood to express anticipation and desire for the giving of the Torah. On Passover, the people of Israel were freed from their enslavement to Pharaoh; on <b>Shavuot</b> they were given the Torah and became a nation committed to serving God. The word <b>Shavuot</b> means weeks, and the festival of <b>Shavuot</b> marks the completion of the seven-week counting period between Passover and <b>Shavuot.</b> The yahrzeit of King David is traditionally observed on <b>Shavuot.</b> Hasidic Jews also observe the yahrzeit of the Baal Shem Tov.|$|R
