Nayyouf claimed that officers of the <b>Special</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> organized the smuggling in collaboration with relatives of Bashar al-Assad including Dhu al-Himma Shalish and Assif Shoakat, who is also CEO of Bhaha, an import/export company owned by the Assad family. Nayyouf identified sites near the cities of al-Baida, Tell Sinan, and Sjinsjar as alleged holding sites for Iraqi WMDs.|$|E

50|$|Because {{of their}} elite status <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> {{received}} better equipment and uniforms than their regular Army counterparts, and could often {{be identified by}} distinctive markings or items of head dress. Members of the regular <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> conventionally wore a scarlet-colored triangle insignia on both shoulders of their uniforms (sometimes backed with white material to form a white border {{around the edge of}} the triangle); they also wore black berets as did some Army personnel, but as a distinctive marking a scarlet ribbon was often sewn to the right of the National cap badge to distinguish bravery in combat and/or loyalty to the Hussein regime. The <b>Special</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards</b> wore a maroon beret with the national eagle device, and a special variation of the triangle shoulder insignia in maroon with green Arabic lettering. The bright red qardoon (shoulder cord) also distinguished Republican Guards; a similar cord with green and red bands was worn by the <b>Special</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards.</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{appeared}} in Strategic Insights, Volume II, Issue 5 (May 2003) After the 1991 Gulf War, Saddam Hussein conducted a systematic concealment operation {{to disrupt the}} mission of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), whose mandate was to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The second team of inspectors, reconstituted as the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) had the formidable task of uncovering the work of Iraq's concealment apparatus: a network of intelligence agencies, military units and government ministries assigned to procure, conceal and defend Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. It is important now to have a full understanding of this concealment apparatus, as this can help uncover where Iraq's weapons of destruction could have been hidden. At this juncture, the U. S. forces deployed in Iraq have to unravel the activities of a network that once consisted of thousands of people from Iraq's General Intelligence, Special Security Organization, Military Industry Commission and the <b>Special</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Guards...</b>|$|R
25|$|Three {{weeks into}} the invasion, U.S.-led Coalition forces moved into Baghdad. Units of the Iraqi <b>Special</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> led the defence of the city. The rest of the {{defenders}} were a mixture of Republican Guard units, regular army units, Fedayeen Saddam, and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. Initial plans were for Coalition units to surround the city and gradually move in, forcing Iraqi armor and ground units to cluster into a central pocket in the city, and then attack with air and artillery forces.|$|E
2500|$|To {{what extent}} the United States fought a {{campaign}} of shock and awe is unclear as post-war assessments are contradictory. Within {{two weeks of the}} United States' victory declaration, on April 27, The Washington Post published an interview with Iraqi military personnel detailing demoralization and lack of command. According to the soldiers, Coalition bombing was surprisingly widespread and had a severely demoralizing effect. When United States tanks passed through the Iraqi military's Republican Guard and <b>Special</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard</b> units outside Baghdad to Saddam's presidential palaces, it caused a shock to troops inside Baghdad. Iraqi soldiers said there was no organization intact by the time the United States entered Baghdad and that resistance crumbled under the presumption that [...] "it wasn't a war, it was suicide." ...|$|E
2500|$|Al-Douri {{played a}} role in the Northern Offensive as {{commander}} of the Naqshbandi Army. Reports soon surfaced that he had links with the jihadist group ISIS, helping them take the city of Tikrit and coordinating attacks against Iraqi security forces. On June 13, a Twitter account, @wikibaghdadi, claimed a [...] "Meeting between ISIS and Naqshbandi Army near al-Qayara area south of Mosul had taken place with representatives from Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi." [...] In July 2014, al-Douri issued an audio recording praising [...] "the heroes and knights of al Qaeda and the Islamic State" [...] forces in attacking Iraqi government positions within Saladin, Kirkuk, Diyala and Nineveh province. His connections with Islamist elements in Iraq is said to have emerged as far back as during Saddam's regime. According to the Soufan Group, al-Douri had close ties with senior ISIS officials Abu Muslim al-Turkmani and Abu Ayman al-Iraqi. Both men had served in the Ba'athist regime under Saddam Hussein, with al-Turkmani being a Lieutenant colonel and serving in the Istikhbarat and <b>Special</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard.</b> Al-Iraqi had been a Colonel in Iraq's Air Defense Intelligence.|$|E
5000|$|Analyst Joseph Holliday {{wrote in}} 2013 that [...] "the Assad {{government}} has {{from the beginning}} of the conflict been unable to mobilize all of its forces without risking largescale defections. The single greatest liability that the Assad regime has faced in employing its forces has been the challenge of relying on units to carry out orders to brutalize the opposition." [...] This has resulted in Bashar's following his father's precedent by attaching regular army units to more reliable forces (<b>Special</b> Forces, <b>Republican</b> <b>Guard,</b> or 4th Armored Division). When Hafez al-Assad directed the suppression of revolts in Hama in 1982, this technique was also used.|$|R
