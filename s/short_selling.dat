5|$|Little {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} and most successful practitioners of market manipulation, making his fortune by leveraging both short sales and short sellers. In the former, he would sell stocks to other traders under contract to purchase it at a later date, betting that the market value would go down in the future and he could pocket the difference (trade rules have changed, and <b>short</b> <b>selling</b> is more complicated than this today). In the latter he would execute the opposite maneuver, corner a market by buying up all of the bonds of a particular company or sector, up-ticking the price so as to make a profit at the expense of any short sales based on those stocks. Hardworking, highly ambitious, and with his eyes set on the very top from the very beginning, Little commonly spent twelve hours a day working on such maneuvers in his office and a further six during the evening engaged in currency speculation.|$|E

5|$|Tulips {{grow from}} bulbs, {{and can be}} {{propagated}} through both seeds and buds. Seeds from a tulip will form a flowering bulb after 7–12 years. When a bulb grows into the flower, the original bulb will disappear, but a clone bulb forms in its place, as do several buds. Properly cultivated, these buds will become bulbs of their own. The mosaic virus spreads only through buds, not seeds, and so cultivating the most appealing varieties takes years. Propagation is greatly slowed down by the virus. In the Northern Hemisphere, tulips bloom in April and May for about one week. During the plant's dormant phase from (Northern Hemisphere) June to September, bulbs can be uprooted and moved about, so actual purchases (in the spot market) occurred during these months. During {{the rest of the}} year, florists, or tulip traders, signed contracts before a notary to buy tulips {{at the end of the}} season (effectively futures contracts). Thus the Dutch, who developed many of the techniques of modern finance, created a market for tulip bulbs, which were durable goods. <b>Short</b> <b>selling</b> was banned by an edict of 1610, which was reiterated or strengthened in 1621 and 1630, and again in 1636. Short sellers were not prosecuted under these edicts, but their contracts were deemed unenforceable.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, the Financial Services Authority had a {{moratorium}} on <b>short</b> <b>selling</b> 29 leading financial stocks, effective from 2300 GMT, 19 September 2008 until 16 January 2009. After the ban was lifted, John McFall, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, House of Commons, made clear in public statements and {{a letter to the}} FSA that he believed it ought to be extended. Between 19 and 21 September 2008, Australia temporarily banned <b>short</b> <b>selling,</b> and later placed an indefinite ban on naked <b>short</b> <b>selling.</b> Australia's ban on <b>short</b> <b>selling</b> was further extended for another 28 days on 21 October 2008. Also during September 2008, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and Canada banned <b>short</b> <b>selling</b> leading financial stocks, and France, the Netherlands and Belgium banned naked <b>short</b> <b>selling</b> leading financial stocks. By contrast with the approach taken by other countries, Chinese regulators responded by allowing <b>short</b> <b>selling,</b> along with a package of other market reforms.|$|E
25|$|Temporary short-selling bans {{were also}} {{introduced}} in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and other European countries in 2008 to minimal effect.

Spain, Portugal and Italy introduced <b>short</b> <b>selling</b> bans in 2011 and again in 2012.

In this case, the bundle would be 1 DEM08_WTA and 1 REP08_WTA; the value of these two shares is guaranteed to be $1 (as they will be cashed out as either worth $1 and $0, or $0 and $1).

25|$|The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 {{gave the}} Securities and Exchange Commission {{the power to}} {{regulate}} short sales.

The uptick rule aimed to prevent short sales from causing or exacerbating market price declines. In January 2005, The Securities and Exchange Commission enacted Regulation SHO to target abusive naked <b>short</b> <b>selling.</b> Regulation SHO was the SEC's first update to <b>short</b> <b>selling</b> restrictions since the uptick rule in 1938.|$|E
