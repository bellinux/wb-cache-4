5|$|Marriages {{between the}} <b>Swazi,</b> Zulu and Thembu royal houses of {{southern}} Africa are common. For example, {{the daughter of}} former South African president and Thembu royal Nelson Mandela, Zenani Mandela, in 1977 married Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini, a brother of Mswati III, King of Swaziland. Elsewhere in the region, Princess Semane Khama of the Bamangwato tribe of Botswana married Kgosi Lebone Edward Molotlegi of the Bafokeng tribe of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Swaziland {{participated in}} nine Summer Olympic Games between its début at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England, with the {{exception}} of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union, the former because of a boycott relating to the New Zealand national rugby union team touring South Africa, and the latter because the country joined the United States-led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War. The highest number of athletes sent by Swaziland to a summer Games is eleven to the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. No <b>Swazi</b> athlete has ever won a medal at the Olympic Games. Swaziland participated in the London Summer Olympics from 27 July to 12 August 2012.|$|E
5|$|Born in Johannesburg to <b>Swazi</b> and Xhosa parents, Makeba {{was forced}} to find {{employment}} as a child {{after the death of}} her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognised when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government.|$|E
5|$|Swaziland {{participated in}} ten Summer Olympics between {{its debut in}} the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The only {{occasions}} in that period which they did not attend was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Soviet Union. On both occasions, it was because they had joined with international boycotts of the events. The first boycott {{was because of the}} inclusion of the New Zealand team at the Games despite the breach of the international sports boycott of South Africa by the nation's rugby union team shortly prior. In 1980, Swaziland joined with the United States led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War. The highest number of Swazis participating at any one Games was 11 at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea. No <b>Swazi</b> has ever won a medal at an Olympics.|$|E

25|$|In February 2016, it was {{announced}} that the ICC had determined that the Swaziland Cricket Association had fielded five ineligible players in the tournament, all of Asian descent. This resulted in the <b>Swazi</b> national team being disqualified from a future tournament.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the migrant}} groups, ancestral to today's Nguni peoples (the Zulu, Xhosa, <b>Swazi,</b> and Ndebele), {{preferred}} {{to live near}} the eastern coast of what is present-day South Africa. Others, {{now known as the}} Sotho–Tswana peoples (Tswana, Pedi, and Sotho), settled in the interior on the plateau known as the Highveld, while today's Venda, Lemba, and Shangaan-Tsonga peoples made their homes in the north-eastern areas of present-day South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Southeast of the Drakensberg {{mountains}} lived Nguni-speaking peoples (Zulu, Xhosa, <b>Swazi,</b> and Ndebele). They too {{engaged in}} state building, with new states developing from rivalry, disagreements, and population pressure causing movement into new regions. This 19th-century process of warfare, state building and migration later {{became known as}} the Mfecane (Nguni) or Difaqane (Sotho). Its major catalyst was the consolidation of the Zulu Kingdom. They were metalworkers, cultivators of millet, and cattle herders.|$|E
25|$|Not all coins are round. The Australian 50 cent coin, for example, has twelve flat sides. Some coins have wavy edges, e.g. the $2 and 20-cent coins of Hong Kong and the 10 cent coins of Bahamas. Some are square-shaped, {{such as the}} 15 cent coin of the Bahamas and the 50 cent coin from Aruba. During the 1970s, <b>Swazi</b> coins were minted {{in several}} shapes, {{including}} squares, polygons, and wavy edged circles with 8 and 12 waves.|$|E
25|$|On the European Tour, the ANZ Championship, {{which ran}} {{for three years}} from 2002, used the same {{modified}} Stableford scoring system as The International. The Investec Royal <b>Swazi</b> Open on the Sunshine Tour has used the same system since 2003. Two Champions Tour events also used the modified Stableford system briefly. They were the Royal Caribbean Classic in 2000 and 2001, and the Uniting Fore Care Classic in 2002. In the latter case, it {{was seen as a}} final attempt to save the failing tournament.|$|E
25|$|The annual Sibebe Survivor event {{began in}} 2004 under the {{leadership}} of Dudu Dhlamini of the International Rotary Club of Mbabane-Mbuluzi. His main purpose was to raise money for various community projects in Mbuluzi, Swaziland. For example, they have helped children from Founteyn Primary School to buy school uniforms, financed free eye-testing for <b>Swazi</b> citizens, and donated wheelchairs to people who could not afford them in rural towns.They have also financed projects for deaf people, helped provide scholarships for OVCs (Orphans and Vulnerable Children), and supported causes such as breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|People {{from all}} around the world are {{motivated}} to join in the annual climb of Sibebe Rock, which is always scheduled for the last Sunday in July. In 2012, the climb was even undertaken by an amputee using his wheelchair and crutches. In 2011, the event raised over 501 thousand Emalangeni (<b>Swazi</b> currency), equivalent to approximately 50,000 Euros. Participants are required to carry at least 1 litre of water, which is supplied {{at the start of the}} hike. The Rotary Club also provides a pre-hike breakfast and presents participants with certificates and prizes afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{sport of}} cricket would be first would play in Swaziland in the 1970s by white expatriates {{who had come}} to the country to work. The sport would not be ccepted by the locals, so its {{following}} would die out before a small group would decide to reintroduce cricket into <b>Swazi</b> society. In 2005, schools would start promoting the sport. In 2007, Swaziland would be accepted into the ICC as an affiliate member alongside Cameroon, the Falkland Islands and Peru. An affiliate member is the lowest possible membership and, , it is held by 56 countries. Affiliate members can not play Test matches.|$|E
25|$|The Zulu {{military}} {{system was}} to transform large swathes of the continent, from south east Africa, into parts of East and Central Africa through the disruptive warfare that broke {{out during the}} reign of Zulu king Shaka. The disruption, known as the Mfecane had several causes, but it was to create several powerful nations in its wake, such as the <b>Swazi,</b> the Nebebele, the Shangaan and others. Many of these new powers copied Zulu methods, weapons and tactics, and saw a measure of success against both indigenous and foreign opponents. The Shangaan for example, founded by war-leader Soshangane, were to migrate into what is now Mozambique and force the Portuguese into paying them tribute.|$|E
25|$|Nine of Hoare's {{team were}} sent to the island of Mahé, Seychelles in advance. They were to {{identify}} potential targets and rally support from dissident Seychellois soldiers. The rest would arrive on a chartered Royal <b>Swazi</b> National Airways plane in the afternoon of 25 November 1981 disguised as vacationing rugby players and members of a charitable beer drinking club. They took the name of their beer club –Ye Ancient Order of Froth-Blowers (AOFB)– from a London society that had been defunct since the 1930s. As part of their cover, the mercenaries disguised as AOFB members filled their baggage with toys that were to be supposedly distributed to local orphanages. In reality, these were meant to conceal the weight of AK-47 rifles hidden under the false bottoms of each item of luggage. Hoare ensured that the toys were as bulky as possible to best suit the purpose.|$|E
500|$|Zenzile Miriam Makeba {{was born}} on 4 March 1932 in the black {{township}} of Prospect, near Johannesburg. Her <b>Swazi</b> mother, Christina Makeba, was a sangoma, or traditional healer, and a domestic worker. Her Xhosa father, Caswell Makeba, was a teacher; he {{died when she was}} six years old. Makeba later said that before she was conceived, her mother had been warned that any future pregnancy could be fatal. Neither Miriam nor her mother seemed likely to survive after a difficult labour. Miriam's grandmother, who attended the birth, often muttered [...] "uzenzile", a Xhosa word that means [...] "you brought this on yourself", to Miriam's mother during her recovery, which inspired her to give her daughter the name [...] "Zenzile".|$|E

The duo was announced by the Swaziland Olympic and Commonwealth Games Association Vice President Adam Mthethwa on 6 July 2016, {{and they would be}} accompanied by manager Thoba Mazibuko and physiotherapist Machawe Mamba. Mthethwa said [...] "We are hopeful that the two will perform at their level best and they can break the national records and improve their personal best times". Matsenjwa was selected to carry the nation's flag during the Parade of Nations in the opening ceremony.|$|E
500|$|In 1867, Pretoria sent Kruger {{to restore}} {{law and order}} in Zoutpansberg. He had around 500 men but very low {{reserves}} of ammunition, and discipline in the ranks was poor. On reaching Schoemansdal, which was under threat by the chief Katlakter, Kruger and his officers resolved that holding the town was impossible and ordered a general evacuation, following which Katlakter razed the town. The loss of Schoemansdal, once a prosperous settlement by Boer standards, was considered a great humiliation by many burghers. The Transvaal government formally exonerated Kruger over the matter, ruling that he had been forced to evacuate Schoemansdal by factors beyond his control, but some still argued that he had given the town up too readily. Peace returned to Zoutpansberg in 1869, following the intervention of the republic's [...] <b>Swazi</b> allies.|$|E
500|$|Earning a small wage, Mandela {{rented a}} room in the house of the Xhoma family in the Alexandra township; despite being rife with poverty, crime and pollution, Alexandra always {{remained}} a special place for him. Although embarrassed by his poverty, he briefly dated a <b>Swazi</b> woman before unsuccessfully courting his landlord's daughter. To save money and be closer to downtown Johannesburg, Mandela moved into the compound of the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association, living among miners of various tribes; as the compound was visited by various chiefs, he once met the Queen Regent of Basutoland. In late 1941, Jongintaba visited Johannesburg—there forgiving Mandela for running away—before returning to Thembuland, where he died in the winter of 1942. Mandela and Justice arrived a day late for the funeral. After he passed his BA exams in early 1943, Mandela returned to Johannesburg to follow a political path as a lawyer rather than become a privy councillor in Thembuland. He later stated that he experienced no epiphany, but that he [...] "simply found [...] doing so, and could not do otherwise." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{moment of}} great {{disorder}} in southern Africa was the Mfecane, [...] "the crushing." [...] It {{was started by}} the northern Nguni kingdoms of Mthethwa, Ndwandwe, and Swaziland over scarce resource and famine. When Dingiswayo of Mthethwa died, Shaka of the Zulu people took over. He established the Zulu Kingdom, asserting authority over the Ndwandwe and pushing the <b>Swazi</b> north. The scattering Ndwandwe and <b>Swazi</b> caused the Mfecane to spread. During the 1820s, Shaka expanded the empire all along the Drakensberg foothills, with tribute being paid {{as far south as}} the Tugela and Umzimkulu rivers. He replaced the chiefs of conquered polities with indunas, responsible to him. He introduced a centralized, dedicated, and disciplined military force not seen in the region, with a new weapon in the short stabbing-spear.|$|E
2500|$|Peoples in {{the path}} of Shaka's armies moved out of his way, {{becoming}} in their turn aggressors against their neighbours. [...] This wave of displacement spread throughout southern Africa and beyond. It also accelerated the formation of several new nation-states, notably those of the Sotho (present-day Lesotho) and of the <b>Swazi</b> (now Swaziland).|$|E

2500|$|The Sibebe Survivor event allows {{many people}} to {{discover}} the remarkable Sibebe Rock, which remains relatively unknown outside of Swaziland due {{to a decline in}} foreign tourism in the post-apartheid era. [...] Rising 1,378 meters above sea level, Sibebe Rock is the second largest rock in the world. [...] In Swaziland, it is commonly compared to the Uluru Rock, or Ayers Rock, in Australia. However, the Sibebe rock is much older, having an estimated age of 3 billion years. [...] According to the archaeologist Peter Beaumont, some artifacts discovered in the late 20th century in caves of the Sibebe valley also date from the Middle Ages. The valley has an altitude of 1,400 meters. [...] A unique <b>Swazi</b> beer, Sibebe Lager, has also been named after Sibebe Rock, honoring it as a symbol of Swaziland.|$|E
2500|$|The {{regiment}} {{sailed to}} South Africa in February 1900, arriving in March. Along with the 7th Dragoon Guards and the 14th Hussars they formed the 4th Cavalry Brigade under Brigadier General Dickson. On 1 May 1900, the Boers made a {{stand in a}} strong position at Houtnek, where the forces of Ian Hamilton faced stiff competition. In a telegram of 2 May Lord Roberts said: [...] "Hamilton speaks in high terms of the services of the 8th Hussars under Colonel Clowes and a made-up regiment of Lancers, which came into Broadwood's brigade and assisted in making the Boers evacuate their position". The 8th then marched from Machadodorp to Heidelberg with the 14th Hussars and M Battery, {{under the command of}} Colonel Mahon. On 13 October, Mahon [...] "became heavily engaged near Geluk with a body of 1100 men with four guns." [...] Mahon succeeded in holding his position until the French came to his assistance, when the Boers were driven back in a south-easterly direction, having sustained some losses. The 8th lost 2 officers, Lieutenants P A T Jones and F H Wylam and 7 men, with 2 officers and 8 men wounded. Eight officers and 8 non-commissioned officers were mentioned in Lord Roberts' final despatches of 2 April and 4 September 1901.

60|$|Now {{it must be}} told of Nada that as the boy Umslopogaas was {{the strongest}} and bravest of children, so the girl Nada was the gentlest and most fair. Of a truth, my father, I believe that her blood was not all Zulu, though this I cannot say for certain. At the least, her eyes were softer and larger than those of our people, her hair longer and less tightly curled, and her skin was lighter--more of the colour of pure copper. These things she had from her mother, Macropha; though she was fairer than Macropha--fairer, indeed, than any woman of my people whom I have seen. Her mother, Macropha, my wife, was of <b>Swazi</b> blood, and {{was brought to the}} king's kraal with other captives after a raid, and given to me as a wife by the king. It was said that she was the {{daughter}} of a <b>Swazi</b> headman of the tribe of the Halakazi, and that she was born of his wife is true, but whether he was her father I do not know; for I have heard from the lips of Macropha herself, that before she was born there was a white man staying at her father's kraal. He was a Portuguese from the coast, a handsome man, and skilled in the working of iron. This white man loved the mother of my wife, Macropha, and some held that Macropha was his daughter, and not that of the <b>Swazi</b> headman. At least I know this, that before my wife's birth the <b>Swazi</b> killed the white man. But none can tell the truth of these matters, and I only speak of them because the beauty of Nada was rather as is the beauty of the white people than of ours, and this might well happen if her grandfather chanced to be a white man.|$|E
