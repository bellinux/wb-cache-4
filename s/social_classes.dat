This study did not generate evidence of a <b>Social</b> <b>Class</b> moderator relationship between warranty attitudes and behaviors and the independent variable, Locus of Control.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>class</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the context of education. Divergent <b>social</b> <b>class</b> outcomes in higher education are often assumed to be a product of differences in access to material resources or academic preparation. However, <b>social</b> <b>class</b> can influence students’ academic outcomes through psychological pathways. What is less clear from current literature is how the psychological experience of <b>social</b> <b>class</b> may vary among individuals within a particular <b>social</b> <b>class</b> background. The purpose of this dissertation was to 1) present a conceptual framework for studying <b>social</b> <b>class</b> identity within the context of higher education, 2) establish the factor structure of a measure based on the theorized dimensions, 3) examine how students’ <b>social</b> <b>class</b> identity relates to variation in their psychological and academic experience of college, and 4) examine whether the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>class</b> identity and students’ psychological and academic outcomes are moderated by race and self-identified <b>social</b> <b>class.</b> Building from sociological and psychological literatures, the proposed multidimensional framework consists of three dimensions of <b>social</b> <b>class</b> identity: identification, centrality, and affect. The affective dimension was comprised of three sub-dimensions: pride, shame, and guilt. A survey was created to measure each dimension and was administered to a sample of 356 African American and White college students. The participants also completed measures of their academic and psychological adjustment outcomes. The factor structure of the measure was examined and found to be consistent with the theoretical framework. Using hierarchical OLS regressions, the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>class</b> identity beliefs and academic and psychological outcomes and the moderating effect of race and self-identified <b>social</b> <b>class</b> were examined. Controlling for objective indicators of SES, the findings demonstrate variation in the dimensions of <b>social</b> <b>class</b> identity among individuals from similar socioeconomic backgrounds and that this variation is predictive of students’ psychological and academic outcomes. The current study provides support for a multidimensional analysis of <b>social</b> <b>class</b> identity, and particularly the examination of different affective dimensions of collective identity. Additionally, this dissertation highlights the importance of examining how <b>social</b> <b>class</b> identity may differentially relate to students’ psychological and academic outcomes as a function of race...|$|R
