50|$|Some {{performance}} tradeoffs {{are typically}} necessary {{when choosing a}} matrix card for use with mixed signals. For example, if both high frequency and low current signals must be switched, take extra care when reviewing the specifications of the card.

A single matrix card may not satisfy both requirements completely, so the <b>system</b> <b>builder</b> must decide which switched signal is more critical.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} how {{manufacturing companies}} within {{the supply chain}} are increasingly expected to provide technologically innovative solutions, rather than simple components. Large global companies are becoming <b>system</b> <b>builders,</b> but as they devolve greater responsibility for technology to suppliers, they are also squeezing cost and timescales. Planning for specific future technology requirements is becoming less relevant to the <b>system</b> <b>builders,</b> but is not a process widely recognised by suppliers. Small suppliers {{do not have the}} resources which the large, vertically integrated firms used to command. Technological innovation will however be necessary for the continuing and future success of the whole supply chain...|$|R

50|$|While PCs {{built by}} system {{manufacturers}} generally {{come with a}} pre-installed operating system, white boxes from {{both large and small}} system vendors and other VAR channels can be ordered with or without a pre-installed OS. Usually when ordered with an operating system, the <b>system</b> <b>builder</b> uses an OEM copy of the OS. Self-building white box PCs are still popular among users of the Linux operating system to ensure hardware support and avoid the Microsoft tax, though some manufacturers such as Asus, Lenovo, and Dell offer Ubuntu pre-installed.|$|E

These product keys are either intended for use with one copy (for retail and <b>system</b> <b>builder),</b> for one OEM (for BIOS locked copies) or to one company (for volume license copies) and are included with the product. However a number of volume licence product keys (which as mentioned above avoid the need for activation) were posted on the Internet and were then used for {{a large number of}} unauthorized installations. The service packs contain a list of these keys and will not update copies of Windows XP that use them.|$|E

50|$|As {{a village}} {{with a central}} place function, three {{bakeries}} with “colonial wares” (originally, products from the “colonies”, thus coffee, tea, cane sugar, tobacco, rice and so on), two butcher’s shops and one Asko Europa-Stiftung branch covered basic demands after the Second World War and until about 1975. Available for further needs were two bank branches, a postal agency, a pharmacy, two textile shops, a shoe shop, an electrical shop, two retail and housewares shops, a stationery shop, a jewellery and watch shop, two shoemaker’s shops, an installation and heating <b>system</b> <b>builder,</b> a locksmith and blacksmith, a cabinetmaker, a painting shop, two hairdressing salons, three tailor’s shops, two dressmaker’s shops, an automotive workshop with a filling station, a Pfalzwerke AG (energy supplier) works and a Raiffeisen yard. These offerings were for a while bolstered by six inns and a cinema. Business and crafts ensured many jobs at that time. There was also work on farms, at the stone quarry and at the many diamond-cutting shops. With the mayoralty, the taxation ofﬁce, the constabulary, the primary school and the Hauptschule, Herschweiler-Pettersheim was a place with good infrastructure. With administrative restructuring in 1972, the village lost its central-place function. The mayoralty and the taxation ofﬁce were, {{in the face of}} the local populace’s opposition, dissolved and by law reassigned to the Verbandsgemeinde of Glan-Münchweiler, a great loss for the municipality, which now had to make do with being nothing more than a population centre. A further cause of this decline was the rising industrial output and mass production of daily needs, the rise of supermarkets, the population’s shift towards the throw-away society, unfavourable wage-price development in agriculture, craft occupations and the diamond industry, which sealed agriculture’s and local business’s fate. Even the post withdrew from the village and the area. Only a few survived the ruinous competition. Of all the businesses that were running just after the war, only one butcher’s shop (with a one-year interruption), one hairdressing salon, the pharmacy (run by Otto Carius) and two inns that both serve meals survived to the turn of the millennium. However, there were some new businesses that came to Herschweiler-Pettersheim in the meantime. Since 1982, a food market with baked goods and meat departments, two branch shops selling baked goods, a drink shop, a florist’s shop, a Turkish produce shop, a kebab shop and a tanning salon have located in the village. Also, in 1973, the Chalou GmbH clothing factory located on the Bockhof, manufacturing ladies’ outerwear. Following the general economic development, the actual production (sewing) was shifted to Eastern Europe, while designing, precutting, pattern creation, ﬁnal inspection, sales and distribution are all things that are handled at the Herschweiler-Pettersheim facility, which in 2004 employed roughly 70 women (but almost 100 in 1986). It is currently the biggest employer in the village and the biggest business tax payer in the Verbandsgemeinde. There are not very many job opportunities for villagers in the village itself nowadays. Indeed, Herschweiler-Pettersheim’s economic structure must be deemed to be rather weak. Most people in the workforce must therefore seek livelihoods in the Saarland and in the Kaiserslautern area, commuting to jobs.|$|E
