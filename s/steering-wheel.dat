5|$|Magnussen made {{a second}} pit {{stop at the}} end of lap 16 for a <b>steering-wheel</b> change. On lap 17 Ricciardo went to the outside of Massa on the S-curves and moved inside, passing Massa to move into sixth. Rosberg was {{informed}} by team radio that more rain was expected within eight minutes. Vettel overtook Bottas around the outside for fourth place on the next lap. Bottas fell to fifth on the 19th lap, when Ricciardo passed him around the outside on the S-curves. Vettel began to reduce the time deficit to third-place Button, and Ricciardo was driving at a speed similar to his teammate. Bottas was caught by his Williams teammate Massa, who pulled away from Hülkenberg (who went off the track at the second turn). Both Red Bull drivers were the fastest by lap 21, but were 13 seconds behind Button and a further five seconds behind Rosberg (who, despite running off the track at 130R corner, had a shrinking one-second advantage over Hamilton). A dry line began to emerge by this time as some drivers drove through standing water to keep their tyre temperatures down.|$|E
25|$|He tinkered {{further with}} motor engines when he {{acquired}} an army-type jeep {{and proceeded to}} invent a second <b>steering-wheel</b> mechanism, adjoined to the pre-existing engine at the rear end, so that the vehicle was able to move in both forward and backward directions with all four pre-existing gears.|$|E
25|$|The Marlin {{emphasized}} the stretched-out hardtop (pillar-less) roofline {{that followed the}} contemporary styling vogue. Automobile Quarterly magazine thought the car very ugly and expressed dislike for the inadequacy of the rear-view window, {{the positions of the}} <b>steering-wheel</b> and stoplights, the softness of the front seats, and the design of the pedals.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{the years}} that Durand was {{designing}} cars he was also involved in other projects. At various times he applied his experience with fibre-reinforced plastics to making sailboats, sports <b>steering-wheels,</b> tool-boxes, mud-flaps and radiator shrouds.|$|R
25|$|The V8 Vantage retailed for £79,000, US$110,000, or €104,000 in 2006, Aston Martin {{planned to}} build up to 3,000 per year. Included was a {{six-speed}} manual transmission and leather-upholstery for the seats, dash, <b>steering-wheel,</b> and shift-knob. A six-speed sequential manual transmission, similar to those produced by Ferrari and Lamborghini, called Sportshift was introduced later as an option.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} {{research objective}} {{which could not}} be achieved with either cadavers or live humans was a means of reducing the injuries caused by impalement on the steering column. By 1964, over a million fatalities resulting from steering wheel impact had been recorded, a significant percentage of all fatalities; the introduction by General Motors in the early 1960s of the collapsible steering column cut the risk of <b>steering-wheel</b> death by fifty percent. The most commonly used animal subjects in cabin-collision studies were pigs, primarily because their internal structure is similar to a human's. Pigs can also be placed in a vehicle in a good approximation of a seated human.|$|E
500|$|Since Steinberg {{settled in}} Ireland, {{she has been}} {{involved}} in a number of projects, including doing the lighting for a Royal Hibernian Academy fringe gallery exhibition in 2001 and for Rex Levitates' dance production Bread & Circus in 2007, which showcases her collaborator Liz Roche. A short dance film she directed, Unsung, which featured Roche's choreography, won a 2008 Dance on the Box award from RTÉ and was shown on that channel as part of the Dublin Dance Festival. [...] Steinberg provided the inspiration behind the dropped-from-on-high <b>steering-wheel</b> microphone that was a striking visual feature of the 2009–2011 U2 360° Tour.|$|E
2500|$|Adult Occupant: [...] – 21 {{calculated}} as 3 for front plus 15 for side, with a struck out star: [...] "The driver's chest {{made contact with}} the <b>steering-wheel,</b> distorting the rim. Compression of the driver's chest indicated an unacceptably high risk of life-threatening injury. As a result, the final star of the adult occupant rating is struck through." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{dashboard}} of the SD1 {{features an}} air vent, unusually, directly facing the passenger. The display binnacle sits {{on top of}} the dashboard in front of the driver to aid production in left-hand drive markets, since it avoided the expense of producing two different dashboard mouldings for LHD and RHD versions. The air vent doubles as a passage for the <b>steering-wheel</b> column, and the [...] "podular" [...] display binnacle can be easily fitted {{on top of the}} dashboard on either the left or right-hand side of the car. This concept was not entirely new; it had also been used on the Range Rover and was used again on the Mk.1 Austin Metro, both of which were also designed by David Bache.|$|E
2500|$|The pilot sat {{immediately}} {{forward of}} the wing and controlled the aircraft by a combination a movable column and a wheel mounted on that column. Pitch was controlled by fore and aft movement of the column, which, by means of wires, moved the elevator mounted at the forward end of the front boom. Yaw control was effected by twisting the column about its vertical axis (by means {{of pressure on the}} steering wheel), which turned the vertical rudder (mounted above the elevator) left or right. Lateral control was achieved by rotating the wheel: When the pilot turned the <b>steering-wheel</b> to port, the linkage (shown below and here) retracted the port wingtip, at the same time extending the starboard extension by the same amount. Thus {{there was no need for}} a rudder bar (or pedals); the pilot’s feet were not used for controlling the aircraft. Also mounted on the control column was a throttle lever; a button on the wheel enabled [...] "the Bosch high-tension magneto to be switched off for the purpose of switching off the engine". There was a fixed tail-plane surface with an area of 10.5 sq.ft. (0.98 sq.m.) at the end of the rear boom to provide [...] longitudinal stability.|$|E
60|$|He {{pushed back}} the {{throttle}} on his <b>steering-wheel</b> {{and stopped the}} engine. Then he turned toward her.|$|E
60|$|Phrases and {{paragraphs}} {{began to}} shape themselves {{in his mind}} as he sat with one arm on his <b>steering-wheel.</b>|$|E
60|$|Tim's back supples visibly to this oiling. Captain George on the c. p. winks {{and points}} to the {{portrait}} of a singularly attractive maiden pinned up on Tim's telescope-bracket above the <b>steering-wheel.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oliver," [...] he said, and as {{he spoke}} he threw over his <b>steering-wheel</b> towards the homeward way.... He {{finished}} his sentence when he had negotiated the corner safely. [...] "Oliver must have her...." ...|$|E
60|$|Deep in {{the iron}} {{chambers}} below, Edgar Berrington stood--not in his wonted dreamy mood, beside the great crank, but close to the <b>steering-wheel</b> of the engine,--alert, steady, {{with his hand on}} the wheel, his eye on the index.|$|E
60|$|On {{reaching}} Sixty-First Street {{she found}} her way blocked by a lumbering delivery wagon. She followed it slowly for a while; then, growing tired of being merely a unit in a procession, tugged at the <b>steering-wheel,</b> {{and turned to the}} right.|$|E
6000|$|Oh, gallant was our galley {{from her}} carven <b>steering-wheel</b> [...] To her figurehead {{of silver and}} her beak of {{hammered}} steel; [...] The leg-bar chafed the ankle, and we gasped for cooler air, [...] But no galley on the water with our galley could compare! ...|$|E
6000|$|Tinka {{sat beside}} him in the car, {{with one hand on}} the <b>steering-wheel,</b> pretending to help him drive, and he shouted back to his wife, [...] "I'll bet the kid will be the best chuffer in the family! She holds the wheel like an old professional!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{watching}} out all I can," [...] was the grim reply. Dave was bending over the <b>steering-wheel,</b> trying {{his best to}} see through the windshield. [...] "I guess I'll have to open it a little," [...] he went on, nodding {{in the direction of the}} glass.|$|E
60|$|Kirk blinked. He {{closed his}} eyes and opened them again. The {{automobile}} was still there, and he was still in it. Ruth was still gazing at him with the triumphant look in her eyes. The chauffeur, silent emblem of a substantial bank-balance, still sat stiffly at the <b>steering-wheel.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{words were}} scarce {{out of my}} mouth as we swept beneath the pitch-black opening. I threw the bow hard up, dragged the speed lever to its last notch, and {{clutching}} a stanchion with one hand and the <b>steering-wheel</b> with the other hung on like grim death and consigned my soul to its author.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your hand {{is asleep}} in my hand's arms," [...] he whispered. The ball of his thumb pressed her thumb, and he whispered once more: [...] "See. Now our hands are kissing each other--we--we must watch them better.... Your thumb {{is like a}} fairy." [...] Again his thumb, {{hardened}} with file and wrench and <b>steering-wheel,</b> touched hers. It was startlingly like a kiss of real lips.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned the}} <b>steering-wheel</b> of his chair, and with Miss Price {{by his side}} passed across the dining-room, out of the Oasis of rose-shaded lights into the shadows, and through the open door. From there {{he turned his head}} before he disappeared, as though to watch his guest. Mrs. Fentolin was busy fondling one of her dogs, which she had raised to her lap, and Hamel was {{watching}} her with a tolerant smile.|$|E
60|$|Kirk, blissfully {{unconscious}} {{that his}} future was being arranged {{for him and}} the <b>steering-wheel</b> of his life quietly taken out of his hands, passed his days {{in a state of}} almost painful happiness. It never crossed his mind that he had ceased to be master of his fate and captain of his soul. The reins were handled so gently that he did not feel them. It seemed to him that he was travelling of his own free will along a pleasant path selected by himself.|$|E
60|$|Even {{before his}} uncle had spoken Dave had pressed down both feet hard, thus {{putting on the}} foot-brake and {{releasing}} the gear-clutch. Now his hand shot over to the emergency brake, and this came {{up with all the}} power at his command. But the grade was downward, and the road slippery from the rain, and instead of stopping, the touring-car went on, sliding through the mud and over the rocks until it was practically on top of the tree. Then came a jar that threw everybody forward. The <b>steering-wheel</b> saved Dave, but his uncle's elbow struck the windshield, cracking it in several places.|$|E
6000|$|George buckles {{him into}} the Frame and {{switches}} on the Direct Control. Now under Tim's left toe lies the port-engine Accelerator; under his left heel the Reverse, and so with the other foot. The lift-shunt stops stand out {{on the rim of}} the <b>steering-wheel</b> where the fingers of his left hand can play on them. At his right hand is the midships engine lever ready to be thrown into gear at a moment's notice. He leans forward in his belt, eyes glued to the colloid, and one ear cocked toward the General Communicator. Henceforth he is the strength and direction of [...] "162," [...] through whatever may befall.|$|E
60|$|The solitary man {{who drove}} this curious car was broad and burly. He sat hunched {{up over his}} <b>steering-wheel,</b> with the brim of a Tyrolean hat drawn down over his eyes. The red end of a {{cigarette}} smouldered under the black shadow thrown by the headgear. A dark ulster of some frieze-like material was {{turned up in the}} collar until it covered his ears. His neck was pushed forward from his rounded shoulders, and he seemed, as the car now slid noiselessly down the long sloping road, with the clutch disengaged and the engine running free, to be peering ahead of him through the darkness in search of some eagerly-expected object.|$|E
60|$|She {{reached the}} Fifth Avenue corner {{just as the}} {{policeman}} {{out in the middle}} of the street swung his Stop-and-Go post round to allow the up-town traffic to proceed on its way. A stream of cars which had been dammed up as far as the eye could reach began to flow swiftly past. They moved in a double line, red limousines, blue limousines, mauve limousines, green limousines. She stood waiting for the flood to cease, and, as she did so, there purred past her the biggest and reddest limousine of all. It was a colossal vehicle with a polar-bear at the <b>steering-wheel</b> and another at his side. And in the interior, very much at his ease, his gaze bent courteously upon a massive lady in a mink coat, sat Uncle Chris.|$|E
60|$|Austin {{was very}} busy between his comrade's room, forecastle, and stoke-hold {{during the rest}} of that day, and he had very little time for rest at night, but though half the men were sick, and his own limbs were aching portentously, it was with a little thrill of exultation he climbed to the bridge early on the {{following}} morning. The windlass was rattling on the forecastle, Wall-eye stood by the winch astern, and the surfboat was sliding towards the mangroves, where a big wire hawser was made fast, in the rain. Austin was not a professional sailor, but he could handle surfboat and steam launch, and in the good days had sailed his yacht along the coast at home. He also had confidence in the grizzled, olive-faced Spaniard who stood gravely behind him, gripping the <b>steering-wheel.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The {{portable}} {{table was}} being put together for dinner {{to the left}} of the wheel by two pig-tailed [...] "boys," [...] who as usual snarled at each other over the job, while another, a doleful, burly, very yellow Chinaman, resembling Mr. Massy, waited apathetically with the cloth over his arm and a pile of thick dinner-plates against his chest. A common cabin lamp with its globe missing, brought up from below, had been hooked to the wooden framework of the awning; the side-screens had been lowered all round; Captain Whalley filling the depths of the wicker-chair seemed to sit benumbed in a canvas tent crudely lighted, and used for the storing of nautical objects; a shabby <b>steering-wheel,</b> a battered brass binnacle on a stout mahogany stand, two dingy life-buoys, an old cork fender lying in a corner, dilapidated deck-lockers with loops of thin rope instead of door-handles.|$|E
60|$|This hall is {{the living-room}} of the house, and walls and roof are of stout logs. Across the joists {{supporting}} the roof are laid many home-made implements, such as spades, saws, fishing-rods, and from hooks in the joists are suspended cured foods, of which hams are specially in evidence. Deep recesses half {{way up the}} walls contain various provender in barrels and sacks. There are some skins, trophies of the chase, on the floor, which is otherwise bare. The chairs and tables are in some cases hewn out of the solid wood, and in others the result of rough but efficient carpentering. Various pieces of wreckage from the yacht have been turned to novel uses: thus the <b>steering-wheel</b> now hangs from {{the centre of the}} roof, with electric lights attached to it encased in bladders. A lifebuoy has become the back of a chair. Two barrels have been halved and turn coyly from each other as a settee.|$|E
60|$|Epochal as {{starting}} {{the car was}} the drama of parking it before he entered his office. As he turned from Oberlin Avenue round the corner into Third Street, N.E., he peered ahead for a space {{in the line of}} parked cars. He angrily just missed a space as a rival driver slid into it. Ahead, another car was leaving the curb, and Babbitt slowed up, holding out his hand to the cars pressing on him from behind, agitatedly motioning an old woman to go ahead, avoiding a truck which bore down on him from one side. With front wheels nicking the wrought-steel bumper of the car in front, he stopped, feverishly cramped his <b>steering-wheel,</b> slid back into the vacant space and, with eighteen inches of room, manoeuvered to bring the car level with the curb. It was a virile adventure masterfully executed. With satisfaction he locked a thief-proof steel wedge on the front wheel, and crossed the street to his real-estate office {{on the ground floor of}} the Reeves Building.|$|E
60|$|He {{gave me the}} amused hand-shake and {{encouraging}} smile which the head master bestows upon the small boy, and, having greeted the others and helped to collect their bags and their cylinders of oxygen, he stowed us and them away in a large motor-car which was driven by the same impassive Austin, the man of few words, whom I {{had seen in the}} character of butler upon the occasion of my first eventful visit to the Professor. Our journey led us up a winding hill through beautiful country. I sat in front with the chauffeur, but behind me my three comrades {{seemed to me to be}} all talking together. Lord John was still struggling with his buffalo story, so far as I could make out, while once again I heard, as of old, the deep rumble of Challenger and the insistent accents of Summerlee as their brains locked in high and fierce scientific debate. Suddenly Austin slanted his mahogany face toward me without taking his eyes from his <b>steering-wheel.</b>|$|E
60|$|The stone {{houses were}} nearest him upon his right. The first was locked; {{in the second}} he could dimly perceive, through a window, a certain {{accumulation}} of pearl-shell piled in the far end; the third, which stood gaping open on the afternoon, seized on the mind of Herrick with its multiplicity and disorder of romantic things. Therein were cables, windlasses, and blocks of every size and capacity; cabin-windows and ladders; rusty tanks, a companion hutch; a binnacle with its brass mountings and its compass idly pointing, in the confusion and dusk of that shed, to a forgotten pole; ropes, anchors, harpoons: a blubber-dipper of copper, green with years; a <b>steering-wheel,</b> a tool-chest with the vessel's name upon the top, the Asia: a whole curiosity-shop of sea-curios, gross and solid, heavy to lift, ill to break, bound with brass and shod with iron. Two wrecks at the least must have contributed to this random heap of lumber; and as Herrick looked upon it, {{it seemed to him}} as if the two ships' companies were there on guard, and he heard the tread of feet and whisperings, and saw with the tail of his eye the commonplace ghosts of sailor men.|$|E
60|$|The {{sky above}} the indistinct horizons of this cloud sea {{was at first}} starry and then paler with a light that crept from north to east as the dawn came on. The Milky Way was {{invisible}} in the blue, and the lesser stars vanished. The face of the adventurer at the <b>steering-wheel,</b> darkly visible ever and again by the oval greenish glow of the compass face, had something of that firm beauty which all concentrated purpose gives, and something of the happiness of an idiot child that has at last got hold of the matches. His companion, a less imaginative type, sat with his legs spread wide over the long, coffin-shaped box which contained in its compartments the three atomic bombs, the new bombs that would continue to explode indefinitely and which no one so far had ever seen in action. Hitherto Carolinum, their essential substance, had been tested only in almost infinitesimal quantities within steel chambers embedded in lead. Beyond the thought of great destruction slumbering in the black spheres between his legs, and a keen resolve to follow out very exactly the instructions that had been given him, the man's mind was a blank. His aquiline profile against the starlight expressed nothing but a profound gloom.|$|E
6000|$|At the Nobby Men's Wear Shop he {{took his}} left hand off the <b>steering-wheel</b> to touch his scarf, and thought well of himself as one who bought {{expensive}} ties [...] "and could pay cash for 'em, too, by golly;" [...] and at the United Cigar Store, with its crimson and gold alertness, he reflected, [...] "Wonder if I need some cigars--idiot--plumb forgot--going t' cut down my fool smoking." [...] He looked at his bank, the Miners' and Drovers' National, and considered how clever and solid he was to bank with so marbled an establishment. His high moment came in the clash of traffic when he was halted at the corner beneath the lofty Second National Tower. His car was banked with four others {{in a line of}} steel restless as cavalry, while the cross town traffic, limousines and enormous moving-vans and insistent motor-cycles, poured by; on the farther corner, pneumatic riveters rang on the sun-plated skeleton of a new building; and out of this tornado flashed the inspiration of a familiar face, and a fellow Booster shouted, [...] "H' are you, George!" [...] Babbitt waved in neighborly affection, and slid on with the traffic as the policeman lifted his hand. He noted how quickly his car picked up. He felt superior and powerful, like a shuttle of polished steel darting in a vast machine.|$|E
