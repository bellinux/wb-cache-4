We assessed the effect <b>of</b> <b>cumin</b> <b>seed</b> essential oil on the biofilm-forming ability of Klebsiella pneumoniae strains and on the integrity of a native resistance plasmid DNA from K. pneumoniae isolates, treated with essential oil. Antibacterial coaction between the essential oil and selected antibiotic disks were determined for inhibiting K. pneumoniae.

Samples of blood, digesta and intestinal tissues were analysed to determine antioxidant activity, bacteria growth and intestinal histomorphology, respectively. The results showed that at 0 - 21 days of age the birds performed better on the diets up to 0. 25 % of herbal inclusion level. Increasing the inclusion level from 0. 5 to 1. 5 % for Origanum minutiflorum, Thymbra spicata and partially for Rosmarinus officinalis increased feed consumption with lower weight gain and depressed efficiency of feed conversion, but not for Salvia tomentosa, Mrytus communis and Cumin. The results further showed that broilers could better perform on the diets up to 0. 5 % of inclusion level at 42 days. All levels (except 1. 5 %) for Cumin and Salvia tomentosa did not cause any impairment in performance of broilers. High inclusion levels (0. 5 to 1. 5 %) reduced E. coli count. The selected herbs did not cause an oxidative stress at a given inclusion level. Of the plants Rosmarinus officinalis clearly demonstrated strong antioxidant effect. The high doses of Origanum minutiflorum caused depression in growth rate associated with shortened villus development of intestinal epithelium in broilers.

40|$|Introduction: Cumin, {{sometimes}} spelled cummin (Cuminum cyminum L.; Apiaceae), {{also known}} as Zeera is native from the East Mediterranean to India. Its seeds {{are used in the}} cuisines of many different cultures, and it is also used as a medicinal plant, serving as a digestant, as well as being used to treat anemia and the common cold. Cumin is a drought tolerant plant, has a short growth season of 100 – 120 days, with optimum growth temperature ranges between 25 °C and 30 °C. Drought {{is one of the most}} important environmental factors that influences <b>seed</b> yield <b>of</b> crop plants in arid and semi-arid regions,through physiological response of plant. To reduce drought stress damages, some synthetic materials like hydroplus superabsorbent polymers, highly hydrophilic due to low cross-links in their structure, can be used to save soil moisture. Thus, superabsorbent polymer may have great potential in restoration and reclamation of soil and storing water available for plant growth and production. Materials and Methods: To evaluate accumulation of photosynthetic pigments and <b>seed</b> yield <b>of</b> <b>cumin,</b> a factorial experiment was conducted based on randomized complete blocks design with three replications at the Research Farm of Urmia University (latitude 37. 53 ° N, 45. 08 ° E, and 1320 m above sea level). - The soil texture of experimental site was clay loam (28...|$|R

The chromosomes {{of the different}} varieties have morphological similarities with no distinct variation in length and volume. Most of the varieties available today are selections. The variabilities of yield and yield components are high. Varieties are developed by sib mating in enclosed chambers or by biotechnology.Cumin is a cross-pollinator, i.e. the breeds are already hybrids. Therefore, methods used for breeding are in vitro regenerations, DNA technologies, and gene transfers. The in vitro cultivation <b>of</b> <b>cumin</b> allows the production of genetically identical plants. The main sources for the explants used in vitro regenerations are embryos, hypocotyl, shoot internodes, leaves, and cotyledons.One goal <b>of</b> <b>cumin</b> breeding is to improve its resistance to biotic (fungal diseases) and abiotic (cold, drought, salinity) stresses. The potential genetic variability for conventional breeding <b>of</b> <b>cumin</b> is limited and research about cumin genetics is scarce.|$|R

The aim this study, was to evaluate the effect <b>of</b> <b>cumin</b> (Cuminum cyminum) essential oil and nisin on the growth of S. iniae. For this purpose, the fillets of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were inoculated with 103 of S. iniae and afterwards were treated with the different concentrations <b>of</b> <b>cumin</b> essential oil (0, 0. 005, 0. 135 and 0. 405 %) as well as nisin (0, 0. 25 and 0. 75 µg/ml). The samples were stored at 4 and 10 ºC for 15 days. Results revealed that in the samples stored at 4 °C the solo application of each <b>of</b> nisin and <b>cumin</b> essential oil could inhibit the growth of S. iniae until day 9; meanwhile, in combining form the inhibition of bacterial growth was occurred for 3 days. In the samples stored at 10 ºC, nisin and cumin essential oil hindered the bacterial growth for 3 and 6 days, respectively. Moreover, combination of the two materials inhibited the bacterial growth until day 6. The highest synergistic effect was observed in 0. 405 % <b>of</b> <b>cumin</b> essential oil and 0. 75 µg/ml of nisin at 4 ºC. However, at 10 ºC, 0. 135 and 0. 405 % <b>of</b> <b>cumin</b> essential oil together with 0. 75 µg/ml of nisin had the highest synergistic effect. As a significant (...|$|R

40|$|Abstrak Ns-D 1 /Ns-D merupakan protein {{defensin}} dalam biji jinten hitam (Nigella sativa) dengan berat molekul (BM) 5, 4763 kDa/ 5, 4924 kDa. Penelitian ini bertujuan menganalisis defensin dari ekstrak protein biji N. sativa dan mencit (Mus musculus) yang diberi ekstrak protein biji N. sativa. M. musculus dibagi menjadi kelompok K (kontrol) yang tidak diberi ekstrak protein biji N. sativa. Kelompok D 1, D 2 dan D 3 diberi ekstrak protein biji N. sativa dalam dosis rendah (0, 35 mg/bb), dosis sedang (0, 7 mg/bb) dan dosis tinggi (1, 4 mg/bb) selama 7 hari dan pada hari ke- 8 dilakukan pengambilan darah. Analisis protein defensin dilakukan melalui teknik SDS-PAGE pada gel poliakrilamid 17 % terhadap sampel darah K, D 1, D 2, D 3 dan sampel ekstrak protein biji N. sativa (T). Hasil menunjukkan pada sampel T terdapat pita protein BM 3, 4 – 10 kDa, pada sampel K terdapat pita protein dengan BM 6, 1486 kDa dan pada sampel D 1, D 2 dan D 3 terdapat pita protein dengan BM 5, 5973 kDa. Munculnya pita protein dengan BM< 6 kDa pada D 1, D 2 dan D 3 menunjukkan adanya Ns-D 1 /Ns-D 2 pada M. musculus yang diberikan ekstrak protein biji N. sativa. Abstract Ns-D 1 /Ns-D 2 are defensins {{protein in}} the <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> black <b>cumin</b> (Nigella sativa) with molecular masses 5. 4763 kDa/ 5. 4924 kDa. This study aimed {{to analyze the}} profile of defensin from black cumin seed extract and its presence in blood of mice (Mus musculus) treated with black cumin seed. The mice were divided into 4 groups (K, D 1, D 2, D 3) and each group consisted of 5 mice. K {{was a group of}} controlled mice, which was not treated by black cumin seed protein extract, while the D 1, D 2, and D 3 were groups of mice which were treated by black cumin seed protein extract with a low dose (0. 35 mg/bw), medium dose (0. 7 mg/bw) and high dose (1. 4 mg/bw). The treatments were conducted for 7 days. Blood of the treated mice were collected at 8 th day. The defensin profiles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The results showed that protein bands within 3. 4 kDa– 10 kDa were found from black cumin seed protein extract (T), at 5. 5973 kDa from all treatments and at 6. 1486 kDa in control (K 1) was detected. The appearance of protein bands lowered than 6 kDa in T, D 1, D 2 and D 3 showed the possibility of the presence <b>of</b> black <b>cumin</b> <b>seed</b> protein extract in the mice blood. </p...|$|R
