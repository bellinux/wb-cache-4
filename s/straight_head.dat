50|$|Bailey is the {{youngest}} member of the Turner family. He is portrayed as inquisitive and a nerd. He enjoys applying himself academically.

Mackenzie enjoyed the storyline, calling it one of his favourites. Bailey became involved in a love triangle with his best friend, Callum (Morgan Baker), and Rani Kapoor (Coco Cherian), that ended in him almost losing his life. Towards the end of 2013, Bailey found himself being manipulated by his teacher Gem Reeves (Kathryn Beck).|$|E
50|$|It {{is a large}} seal, with bulls in {{the eastern}} Atlantic populations {{reaching}} 2.5 - 3.3 m long and weighing 170 - 310 kg; the cows are much smaller, typically 1.6 - 2.0 m long and 100 - 190 kg in weight.

Males are generally darker than females, with lighter patches and often scarring around the neck. Females are silver grey to brown with dark patches.|$|E

5000|$|Bailey is the {{youngest}} child of Lauren and Matt Turner (Josef Brown). Before his on-screen introduction, Kendall described Bailey as being [...] "a brain". A writer for the show's official website stated [...] "Cheeky, left-of-centre and inquisitive, Bailey Turner is one switched on teen. A self described nerd, Bailey loves flexing his brain muscles and has a unique take on everything." [...] Bailey enjoys applying himself academically and he loves astronomy and physiology. Mackenzie called Bailey [...] "the glue" [...] of the Turner family, explaining [...] "If Dad or Mason can't fix it, Bailey will always try. He {{is the one who}} keeps a <b>straight</b> <b>head</b> in the family." [...] He stated that Bailey gets on well with his siblings Amber (Jenna Rosenow) and Mason (Taylor Glockner), but there is a competitive spirit amongst them and sometimes they wind each other up. Bailey loves his parents equally and always wants the best for them.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} newborns’ {{sensitivity to}} the direction of gaze of another’s face by using a preferential looking technique. This study extends earlier work on a preference for faces with direct gaze in newborns. In Experiment 1, we replicate the basic finding of Farroni and colleagues that newborns prefer to look at faces with direct gaze. In Experiments 2 and 3, we establish that a preference for faces with direct gaze in newborns is present only {{within the context of}} an upright face and a <b>straight</b> <b>head,</b> suggesting that relatively primitive configuration-sensitive mechanisms may be operating. Overall, these results further the view that relatively simple perceptual biases in newborns may be an essential foundation for later social-cognitive development...|$|E

50|$|From {{the later}} {{part of the}} 15th century, some of the Welsh castles {{underwent}} a transformation into grand houses. Some of these such as Chirk Castle and Powis Castle have remained as houses, but others such as Raglan Castle in Monmouthshire and Carew Castle in Pembrokeshire are ruins which can provide some idea of their grandeur. At Carew Sir Rhys ap Thomas from about 1480 onwards undertook a grand re-modelling including an almost entire re-fenestration with <b>straight</b> <b>headed</b> windows. This was continued after 1558 by Sir John Perrot who replaced the north range with a splendid frontage with a long gallery at the second floor level in the fashion of Robert Smythson.|$|R
