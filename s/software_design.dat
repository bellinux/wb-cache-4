25|$|Several schemes assist {{managing}} programmer activity so {{that fewer}} bugs are produced. Software engineering (which addresses <b>software</b> <b>design</b> issues as well) applies many techniques to prevent defects. For example, formal program specifications state the exact behavior of programs so that design bugs may be eliminated. Unfortunately, formal specifications are impractical {{for anything but}} the shortest programs, because of problems of combinatorial explosion and indeterminacy.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{research}} is to analyze musical software for a personal computer and create software to educate students’ musical rhythm. We have carried out music teachers’ and students’ survey, using internet site, also analysis of <b>software,</b> <b>designed</b> to teach music, using extended ITC criteria was made. The research proved, that Lithuanian secondary schools demand Lithuanian <b>software</b> <b>designed</b> to educate rhythm greatly, also there exist {{many different kinds of}} <b>software</b> <b>designed</b> to educate rhythm in foreign languages, but they are paid and do not correspond certain ITC criteria. There is not Lithuanian <b>software</b> <b>designed</b> to educate rhythm. We chose programming language Delphi and <b>designed</b> <b>software</b> “Rhythm”, which has a purpose to help a music teacher to teach music topic “Rhythm” and to enable a student to analyze tasks of rhythmical course by himself. It was found in the experimental part of {{the research}}, that software “Rhythm” suits for teaching rhythm theory in five lesson types. It is found, that students, who used educational software “Rhythm” during a music lesson, learning motivation and progress were higher than those, who didn’t use the software...|$|R

25|$|Dijkstra's {{ideas about}} {{programming}} methodology (especially the structured programming movement) helped lay {{the foundations for}} the birth {{and development of the}} professional discipline of software engineering (in particular the <b>software</b> <b>design</b> and development), enabling programmers to organize and manage increasingly complex software projects. In the late 1960s Dijkstra discussed the concept of program families. And in the mid 1970s David Parnas and others clarified the idea and showed how to apply it in software engineering principles.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the general purpose computer <b>software</b> <b>design</b> environment, a primary characteristic of embedded environments is {{the sheer number of}} different platforms available to the developers (CPU architectures, vendors, operating systems and their variants). Embedded systems are, by definition, not general-purpose designs: they are typically developed for a single task (or small range of tasks), and the platform is chosen specifically to optimize that application. Not only does this fact make life tough for embedded system developers, it also makes debugging and testing of these systems harder as well, since different debugging tools are needed in different platforms.|$|E

25|$|Karnaugh {{maps are}} used to simplify {{real-world}} logic requirements {{so that they can}} be implemented using a minimum number of physical logic gates. A sum-of-products expression can always be implemented using AND gates feeding into an OR gate, and a product-of-sums expression leads to OR gates feeding an AND gate. Karnaugh maps can also be used to simplify logic expressions in <b>software</b> <b>design.</b> Boolean conditions, as used for example in conditional statements, can get very complicated, which makes the code difficult to read and to maintain. Once minimised, canonical sum-of-products and product-of-sums expressions can be implemented directly using AND and OR logic operators.|$|E
25|$|Like the H/ZBJ-1 combat data {{system on}} board, the JRSCCS is {{distributed}} and redundant and reflects both Russian and Western influence. From the Russian/Soviet tradition, each sensor handles {{as much of}} its own data processing as possible. While this potentially allows the design of individual system components to be simplified, the Chinese followed the Western tradition by ensuring central components can still process all information from the sensors {{in the event of}} sensor hardware malfunction. The cost of such redundancy is such that half the price of the ship is in its C4I systems. Another Western design tradition incorporated was the use of an open architecture <b>software</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{application}} of CSP to <b>software</b> <b>design</b> has usually focused on dependable and safety-critical systems. For example, the Bremen Institute for Safe Systems and Daimler-Benz Aerospace modeled a {{fault management system}} and avionics interface (consisting of some 23,000 lines of code) intended for use on the International Space Station in CSP, and analyzed the model to confirm that their design was free of deadlock and livelock. The modeling and analysis process was able to uncover a number of errors {{that would have been}} difficult to detect using testing alone. Similarly, Praxis High Integrity Systems applied CSP modeling and analysis during the development of software (approximately 100,000 lines of code) for a secure smart-card Certification Authority to verify that their design was secure and free of deadlock. Praxis claims that the system has a much lower defect rate than comparable systems.|$|E
