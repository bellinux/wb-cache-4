40|$|Abstract First {{version of}} Invenio {{considered}} albums as a first-class citizen {{of a system}} while treating photos as a <b>subrecord</b> of an album limiting user’s ability to add extra metadata to single pictures or index/search them. Additionally, management issues came into play, when user wanted to place one photo in multiple albums {{the only way to}} achieve that was to upload it twice, therefore introducing high redundancy. The goal of photo albums changes in Invenio 2 is to solve aforementioned issues, by extracting pictures from albums, creating new records out of them and translating them to JSON from previous marc 21 format to gain even more flexibility...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} the {{consistency}} of a frequency-domain, errors-in-variables estimator using data ex-tracted from overlapping <b>subrecords.</b> While the classical approach without overlap needs six consecutive periods, we show in this paper that by using overlapping <b>subrecords,</b> consistent models can be found with only two periods of the steady-state response of a periodic excitation. Moreover, the system identification procedure used for data extracted from independent experiments is shown to be valid for data extracted from overlapping <b>subrecords.</b> This allows the user to considerably reduce the measurement time or the measurement uncertainty without changing the identification procedure.

40|$|The {{algorithm}} {{is useful for}} measuring net system damping levels in stochastic processes and {{for the development of}} equivalent linearized system response models. The algorithm works by summing together all <b>subrecords</b> which occur after predefined threshold level is crossed. The random decrement signature is normally developed by scanning stored data and adding <b>subrecords</b> together. The high speed implementation of the random decrement algorithm exploits the digital character of sampled data and uses fixed record lengths of 2 (n) samples to greatly speed up the process. The contributions to the random decrement signature of each data point was calculated only once and in the same sequence as the data were taken. A hardware implementation of the algorithm using random logic is diagrammed and the process is shown to be limited only by the record size and the threshold crossing frequency of the sampled data. With a hardware cycle time of 200 ns and 1024 point signature, a threshold crossing frequency of 5000 Hertz can be processed and a stably averaged signature presented in real time...|$|R
40|$|From {{previous}} {{analysis of}} the daily minimum, meam and maximum temperatures in Modena, Italy, over more than 100 years, {{it has already been}} demonstres that each time series may be well represented by the sum of a seasonal deterministic function and a stationary gaussian stochastic signal. The latter was found to be autocorrelated and well represented by an autoregressive, moving-average process of order 2 and 1 respectively, AR(2) -MA(1). In this paper, starting from <b>subrecords</b> of daily temperatures, taken from the whole record available in Modena, long-term and short-term predictions have been compared with the actually measured values. The positive results obtained by using the previous model suggest that such statistical forecasting can be performed also in other locations of similar climatic behavior, even if only short records of daily temperatures are available...|$|R
40|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{necessary to determine}} {{the manner in which}} materials and structures deteriorate with respect to time when subjected to sustained random dynamic loads. In such cases a system's fatigue characteristics can be obtained by continuously monitoring its modal parameters. This allows for any structural deterioration, often manifested as a loss in stiffness, to be detected. Many common structural integrity assessment techniques make use of Fourier analysis for modal parameter extraction. For continual modal parameter extraction, the Fourier transform requires that a compromise be made between the accuracy of the estimates and how frequently they can be obtained. The limitations brought forth by this compromise can be significantly reduced by selecting suitable values for the analysis parameters, mainly <b>subrecord</b> length and number of averages. Further improvements may also be possible by making use of spectral enhancement techniques, specifically overlapped averaging and zero padding. This paper uses the statistical analysis of results obtained from numerous physical and numerical experiments to evaluate the influence of the analysis parameters and spectral enhancement techniques on modal estimates obtained from limited data sets. This evaluation will assist analysts in selecting the most suitable inputs for parameter extraction purposes. The results presented in this paper show that when using the Fourier transform to extract modal characteristics, any variation in the parameters used for analysis can have a significant influence on the extraction of natural frequency estimates from systems subjected to random excitation. It was found that for records containing up to 10 % noise, <b>subrecord</b> length; hence spectral resolution, has a more pronounced influence on the accuracy of modal estimates than the level of spectral averaging; therefore spectral uncertainty. It was also found that while zero padding may not increase the actual spectral resolution, it does allow for improved natural frequency estimates with the introduction of interpolated estimates at the nondescribed frequencies. Finally, it was found that for modal parameter extraction purposes (in this case natural frequency), increased amounts of overlapped averaging can significantly reduce the variance of the estimates obtained. This is particularly useful as it allows for increased precision without compromising temporal resolution...|$|E
40|$|Autonomically-mediated baroreflex {{control of}} heart rate has been {{extensively}} studied (cardiac BRS, cBRS), but peripheral control of blood pressure is less well known. Total peripheral resistance (TPR) was derived from pulse contour stroke volume (SVPC) using non-invasive blood pressure (Finapres). The beat-to-beat variability of Finapres SVPC was evaluated in cardiac catheterisation patients against aortic blood pressure SVPC. Correlations were generally good (mean R = 0. 75), but regression slopes tended {{to be less than}} unity and several aortic recordings were significantly affected by the dynamic response of the measurement system. Finapres SVPC was also compared to Doppler stroke distance (SD) in healthy volunteers. Both measures followed respiratory movements well, although SVPC had higher coherence with respiration. Discrepancies between the results were considered to be mainly due to errors in the Doppler method. Coherence thresholds for spectral cBRS were determined {{as a function of the}} number of <b>subrecords</b> available for ensemble averaging and the effect of ventricular ectopics on cBRS estimates was investigated. Pulse contour TPR data was then used to determine peripheral BRS (pBRS) in healthy controls and neurocardiogenic syncope patients (NCS) using methods adapted from cardiac BRS analysis. Diastolic pressure produced greater pBRS estimates than systolic pressure and pBRS was generally higher in patients and fainters than in controls and non-fainters. Tilt did not have a consistent effect on pBRS and it was not linearly related to age or resting blood pressure, although it may be increased in hypertension and the elderly. pBRS was able to discriminate between the subject groups when cBRS methods showed no difference...|$|R
