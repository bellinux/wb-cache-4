5|$|This {{species is}} a <b>secondary</b> <b>host</b> of the {{parasitic}} great spotted cuckoo, the European magpie being the preferred host. However, {{in areas where}} the latter species is absent, such as Israel and Egypt, the hooded crow becomes the normal corvid host.|$|E
5|$|In {{the life}} cycle of Plasmodium, a female Anopheles {{mosquito}} (the definitive host) transmits a motile infective form (called the sporozoite) to a vertebrate host such as a human (the <b>secondary</b> <b>host),</b> thus acting as a transmission vector. A sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to liver cells (hepatocytes), where it reproduces asexually (tissue schizogony), producing thousands of merozoites. These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles (blood schizogony) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, at which point the cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies are {{affected}} by three major groups of parasites: water mites, gregarine protozoa, and trematode flatworms (flukes). Water mites, Hydracarina, can kill smaller dragonfly larvae, and may also be seen on adults. Gregarines infect the gut and may cause blockage and secondary infection. Trematodes are parasites of vertebrates such as frogs, with complex life cycles often involving a period as a stage called a cercaria in a <b>secondary</b> <b>host,</b> a snail. Dragonfly nymphs may swallow cercariae, or these may tunnel through a nymph's body wall; they then enter the gut and form a cyst or metacercaria, which remains in the nymph {{for the whole of}} its development. If the nymph is eaten by a frog, the amphibian becomes infected by the adult or fluke stage of the trematode.|$|E

50|$|Specificity for soybean aphids {{to feed on}} soybean {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} by Han and Yan (1995) in an experiment utilizing an electrical penetration graph. While {{no difference in the}} amount of time spent probing between soybean and other non-host plants was observed, the ingestion of phloem by soybean aphids was either greatly reduced or did not happen at all on non-host plants. Nevertheless, some alternate <b>secondary</b> <b>hosts</b> have been observed for soybean aphids. The most widespread of these alternate <b>secondary</b> <b>hosts</b> is wild soybean (Glycine soja), which has been known to support colonies of soybean aphids in Asia. In Korea and the Philippines, kudzu (Pueraria montana) and tropical kudzu (Pueraria javanica) have been described as alternate <b>secondary</b> <b>hosts,</b> respectively.|$|R
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid has both sexual and asexual generations in its life cycle. It also {{alternates}} hosts {{at different times}} of year. The primary host plants are woody shrubs, and eggs are laid on these by winged females in the autumn. The adults then die and the eggs overwinter. The aphids that hatch from these eggs in the spring are wingless females known as stem mothers. These are able to reproduce asexually, giving birth to live offspring, nymphs, through parthenogenesis. The lifespan of a parthenogenetic female is about 50 days and during this period, each can produce as many as 30 young. The offspring are also females and able to reproduce without mating, but further generations are usually winged forms. These migrate to their <b>secondary</b> <b>host</b> plants, completely different species that are typically herbaceous plants with soft, young growth.|$|E
25|$|The Bay checkerspot {{depends upon}} plants in two {{different}} genera as a larva. The primary host plant is of the genus Plantago while the <b>secondary</b> <b>host</b> plants occur in the genus Castilleja.|$|E
25|$|Gynoparae (heteroecious {{only and}} {{produced}} on <b>secondary</b> <b>host</b> {{in response to}} longer nights and falling temperature). Nymphs can only feed on secondary hosts, and are unable to consume the primary host.|$|E

50|$|Pseudothlepshusids are of {{significance}} to humans because many species are <b>secondary</b> <b>hosts</b> for lung flukes {{of the genus}} Paragonimus. Predators of pseuthelphusid crabs include the yellow-spotted river turtle and the tufted capuchin.|$|R
50|$|Gymnosporangium libocedri (Pacific Coast Pear Rust) is a plant pathogen. It {{produces}} orange gelatinous growths (telia) on {{incense cedar}} in the spring. Its <b>secondary</b> <b>hosts</b> include apple, crabapple, hawthorn, mountain ash, pear, quince and serviceberry.|$|R
25|$|Alate exules are {{produced}} on <b>secondary</b> <b>host</b> if heteroecious, if autoecious will be produced on host anyway. For the alate exules the same factors apply as for emigrants EXCEPT that crowding is more important.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifecycle}} of sugarbeet root aphids involves {{primary and}} <b>secondary</b> <b>host</b> plants. Galls are formed on the primary host, cottonwood, {{in the spring}} by the stem mother. Her wingless offspring, called apterae, feed on the gall until giving rise to winged individuals called alatae. These alatae {{break out of the}} gall and colonize the roots of their secondary hosts, sugarbeet.|$|E
25|$|These {{individuals}} then {{suck the}} sap from the sugarbeet roots, which {{causes them to}} lose their color, wilt, and die. Infestation is apparent where they appear as circular patches in which plants and leaves are wilted and dying. During dry years when cracks form in the soil, the <b>secondary</b> <b>host</b> roots become much more accessible to the aphids, {{which can lead to}} severe yield loss.|$|E
50|$|The {{genes in}} the phagocytosed eukaryote's nucleus are often {{transferred}} to the <b>secondary</b> <b>host's</b> nucleus.Cryptomonads and chlorarachniophytes retain the phagocytosed eukaryote's nucleus, an object called a nucleomorph, located between {{the second and third}} membranes of the chloroplast.|$|R
25|$|Males are {{produced}} on <b>secondary</b> <b>hosts</b> in heteroecious and in autoecious, normal hosts. These, too, {{are produced}} {{in response to}} longer nights and decreased temperature. Of these, only 0.6% of autumn alate migrants find host plants, i.e. gynoparae.|$|R
50|$|On the <b>secondary</b> <b>hosts,</b> {{the fungus}} {{produces}} yellowish depressions on the leaves. It also infects the fruit, which grows whitish tubes like a Medusa head. These are the spore tubes. The spores must then infect a juniper {{to complete the}} life cycle.|$|R
25|$|After {{securing}} a sponsorship {{deal with the}} Chicago-based retailer Sears, Roebuck & Co., Soul Train premiered on WCIU-TV on August 17, 1970, as a live show airing weekday afternoons. The first episode of the program featured Jerry Butler, the Chi-Lites, and the Emotions as guests. Cornelius was assisted by Clinton Ghent, a local professional dancer who appeared on early episodes before moving behind the scenes as a producer and <b>secondary</b> <b>host.</b>|$|E
25|$|Plantago erecta, or dwarf {{plantain}}, {{is one of}} {{the primary}} host plants in the genus Plantago for the Bay checkerspot butterfly. In many years, the plantain dries up causing the checkerspot larvae to seek a <b>secondary</b> <b>host</b> plant. P. erecta is native to California and only found in western North America. As the primary host plant for the Bay checkerspot, it is an important species for conservation of the butterfly. P. erecta is known variously as California plantain, English plantain, foothill plantain, dotseed plantain, and dwarf plantain. It is typically found in coastal sage scrub, foothill woodland, and chaparral biomes.|$|E
25|$|In {{heteroecious}} species, the aphids spend winter on tree or bush primary hosts; in summer, they {{migrate to}} their <b>secondary</b> <b>host</b> on a herbaceous plant, then the gynoparae {{return to the}} tree in autumn. The pea aphid has a primary host of a perennial vetch and secondary of the annual pea. This is likely due to the decline of food quality in trees during the summer, as well as overcrowding amongst aphids which they sense when they bump into each other too often. The heteroecious life cycle (which is mainly linked to consumption of angiosperms and represents 10% of all aphids) {{is believed to have}} evolved from the ancestral autoecious form (on conifers); this is believed to have reverted to the ancestral form in some species that were once heteroecious.|$|E
25|$|Sugarbeet roots {{have become}} a common crop for sucrose {{production}} in the northern United States. A concern among farmers is the impact that sugarbeet root aphids can have on these crops, which are colonized by and used as <b>secondary</b> <b>hosts</b> for sugarbeet root aphids.|$|R
50|$|Nasonovia ribisnigri is {{a species}} of aphid. Their primary hosts are currant plants, {{including}} blackcurrants (Ribes nigrum) and gooseberries (Ribes uva-crispa), while the <b>secondary</b> <b>hosts</b> are {{a wider range of}} plants, including members of the Compositae (Hieracium, Lapsana, Crepis, Leontodon and Cichorium), Lamiales (Veronica and Euphrasia) and Solanaceae (Nicotiana and Petunia).|$|R
5000|$|A {{polyphagous}} species, this beetle has {{a variety}} of host plants from several different families.

2500|$|A form of FCV {{has been}} found to cause a {{particularly}} severe systemic disease in cats, similar to rabbit hemorrhagic disease (which is also caused by a calicivirus). [...] This virus has been called virulent systemic feline calicivirus (VS-FCV) or FCV-associated virulent systemic disease (VSD). [...] The disease is caused by direct viral invasion of epithelium and endothelium and <b>secondary</b> <b>host</b> immune response. Strains of VS-FCV have seemingly risen independently of one another since first being described, meaning that not all cases of VS-FCV have spread from a single case. [...] Most of the outbreaks of VS-FCV {{have been reported in the}} United States. [...] It was originally described in 1998 in Northern California.|$|E
50|$|Contrarily, host-shift is {{a gradual}} {{change of the}} {{relative}} role of a particular host species as primary versus <b>secondary</b> <b>host,</b> {{in case of a}} multi-host parasite species. The former primary host slowly becomes a <b>secondary</b> <b>host</b> or even becomes totally abandoned, while the former <b>secondary</b> <b>host</b> becomes a new primary host species. This process is slower and more predictable, and it does not increase parasite diversity. Predictably, it more often occurs in shrinking host populations that harbours a relatively (considering the small host population size) rich parasite/pathogen fauna.|$|E
5000|$|Another feature {{shared by}} the Eucharitidae and Perilampidae is the first-instar larvae are called [...] "planidia" [...] and are {{responsible}} for gaining access to the host, rather than the egg-laying females. Those species which are hyperparasitoids burrow into a <b>secondary</b> <b>host's</b> body and seek out endoparasitoid larvae, such as tachinid flies or ichneumonoid wasps, and attack them.|$|R
40|$|BALB/c mice, {{which are}} {{normally}} highly susceptible to growth of Leishmania mexicana parasites in vivo, can be vaccinated with avirulent temperature-sensitive mutants of L. mexicana so that challenge with virulent organisms results in markedly diminished {{growth of the}} latter. Parasites extracted from the lesions which do appear in these mice are able to produce active infection in <b>secondary</b> <b>hosts,</b> although the rate of progression of these lesions is slower than that seen with the original virulent cloned organism. Interestingly, when irradiated parasites from the <b>secondary</b> <b>hosts</b> are themselves used to vaccinate naive BALB/c mice, less protection is seen than when irradiated virulent organisms from the initial infecting clone are used. These data suggest that when infection does take place in mice vaccinated with avirulent clones of parasite, the organisms which develop in lesions in these animals are substantially modified from those present in the initial infecting inoculum...|$|R

50|$|A <b>secondary</b> <b>host</b> or {{intermediate}} host is a host that harbors the parasite {{only for a}} short transition period, during which (usually) some developmental stage is completed. For trypanosomes, the cause of sleeping sickness, strictly, humans are the <b>secondary</b> <b>host,</b> while the tsetse fly is the primary host, given {{that it has been}} shown that reproduction occurs in the insect. Cestodes (tapeworms) and other parasitic flatworms have complex life-cycles, in which specific developmental stages are completed in a sequence of several different hosts.|$|E

5|$|Mites and {{nematodes}} feed on ticks, {{which are}} also a minor nutritional resource for birds. More importantly, they carry diseases as the primary hosts of pathogens such as spirochaetes, and without their agency, the organisms could not reach their <b>secondary</b> <b>hosts.</b> The diseases caused may debilitate their victims, and ticks may thus be assisting in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing.|$|R
50|$|Brachycaudus helichrysi overwinters as fertilised eggs which hatch {{during the}} winter or early spring, before the plum and damson trees on which they are laid come into leaf. The fundatrices (viviparous {{parthenogenetic}} females produced on the primary host) feed at first {{at the base of}} buds but as the buds begin to expand, they move on to softer tissues, and later on to the new shoots and underside of the foliage. By May, some winged forms are beginning to appear and these fly to <b>secondary</b> <b>hosts,</b> such as Asteraceae, Chrysanthemum and Trifolium, where they found new colonies. The colonies on the primary host gradually die out. Further generations develop on the <b>secondary</b> <b>hosts</b> and in the autumn, winged forms fly back to the primary host. Here sexual forms develop, mating takes place and eggs are laid on twigs and spurs of the plum and damson trees. Natural enemies include ladybirds, lacewings, soldier beetles and hoverflies.|$|R
5000|$|A its {{common name}} implies, rice caseworm {{is one of}} the major pests of rice {{throughout}} the world. Larvae is the infective stage, where they cut leaf tips to make leaf cases.
