Simpson's assistant manager was Peter Ward, who was previously assistant manager at the club between 2005 and 2009 under Gannon, and who also played over 100 games for the club in the 1990s. On 4 January 2011 <b>Simpson</b> <b>was</b> sacked, his place taken by Peter Ward on a caretaker basis. Ward was replaced by Ray Mathias after 12 games and two wins.

5|$|<b>Simpson</b> <b>was</b> {{killed on}} 9 May 2013, during {{training}} for the 34th America's Cup, when the Swedish Artemis Racing team yacht he was aboard capsized near Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay. The yacht, a 72-foot catamaran with a rigid, wing-like sail, was turning downwind and bearing away when it flipped over and broke into pieces. <b>Simpson</b> <b>was</b> trapped underneath its hulls for approximately ten minutes, and attempts to revive him by doctors afloat and subsequently ashore were unsuccessful. The cause of the accident is unknown. An investigation was initiated by the United States Coast Guard which involved San Francisco police and the America's Cup management.|$|E
5|$|After Simpson's {{decision}} {{to focus on}} Fightstar, the band entered Criterion Studios in London with producer Mark Williams to begin work on their first EP, They Liked You Better When You Were Dead. It was released as a mini-album, containing nine tracks written during the six months Simpson and Westaway lived together. Recording sessions were often interrupted, since <b>Simpson</b> <b>was</b> {{in the midst of}} a sold-out series of Wembley shows with Busted.|$|E
5|$|Goddard had a weak {{heart and}} had never flown before, so he asked his doctor, William Kirkwood, to {{accompany}} him on the trip. As Kirkwood was a resident at a maternity hospital, his presence led to false speculation that <b>Simpson</b> <b>was</b> pregnant, and even {{that she was having}} an abortion. The press excitedly reported that the solicitor had flown to Simpson accompanied by a gynaecologist and an anaesthetist (who was actually the lawyer's clerk).|$|E

5|$|Initially, coach <b>Simpson</b> <b>was</b> not informed; when {{he found}} out, he was angry that the ACB had not trusted him enough {{to tell him what}} his players had done. Captain Mark Taylor was also aware of the issue by the time he took the team to the West Indies, as were vice-captain Ian Healy and Waugh's brother Steve.|$|E
5|$|Brian Charles Booth (born 19 October 1933) is {{a former}} Australian cricketer who played in 29 Tests from 1961 to 1966, and 93 {{first-class}} matches for New South Wales.

5|$|Colin Hall <b>Simpson</b> <b>was</b> born in St Kilda, Victoria, on 13 April 1894, {{the son of}} Colin Simpson, a plumber, and {{his wife}} Elizabeth Fulton Simpson, née Jordan. He was educated at St Kilda Primary School, and, from 1911, at Caulfield Grammar School. While at Caulfield Grammar, Simpson joined the Australian Army Cadets, rising {{to the rank of}} sergeant.

5|$|Counsel {{assisting}} the Inquiry, Henry Winneke, advocated {{that the cause}} of the accident was Spence's diabetes. Justice <b>Simpson</b> <b>was</b> critical of the Director-General's investigation panel for considering 25 possible causes of the accident but failing to consider that the Department's negligence in licensing a diabetic pilot might have been the root cause of the accident. After the inquiry had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice Simpson said the insulin reaction of the pilot might have had a considerable bearing on the accident.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Loxton {{helped to}} select David Hookes {{to make his}} debut in the Centenary Test, after {{receiving}} a recommendation from Bradman, who had retired from the panel. Hookes famously struck five consecutive fours in one Tony Greig over in an Australian win. The later period of Loxton's tenure was thrown into chaos {{when most of the}} leading players abandoned the existing establishment to sign contracts with the breakaway World Series Cricket—which offered substantially more remuneration—meaning that an almost-entirely new team had to be cobbled together; the 42-year-old Bob <b>Simpson</b> <b>was</b> brought out of a decade of retirement to lead the outfit. During this time, Australia's depleted team suffered many heavy defeats.|$|E
5|$|In {{the thirteenth}} {{stage of the}} 1967 Tour de France, Simpson {{collapsed}} and died during the ascent of Mont Ventoux. He was 29 years old. The post-mortem examination found that he had mixed amphetamines and alcohol; this diuretic combination proved fatal when combined with the heat, the hard climb of the Ventoux and a stomach complaint. A memorial near where he died has become a place of pilgrimage for many cyclists. <b>Simpson</b> <b>was</b> known to have taken performance-enhancing drugs during his career, when no doping controls existed. He is held in high esteem by many cyclists for his character and will to win.|$|E

In 2012, The <b>Simpsons</b> <b>was</b> the sixth-most expensive television series in the United States to sponsor. The top five were (in ascending order) American Idol (Thursday), New Girl, Modern Family, American Idol (Wednesday), and NBC Sunday Night Football.

5|$|The New York stage {{has seen}} two {{productions}} {{derived from the}} film. A musical based on the film opened on Broadway on 14 December 1969, but closed after one performance. Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart <b>Simpson,</b> <b>was</b> so impressed by Giulietta Masina's work in La Strada that she attempted to obtain theatrical rights to the film in order to mount a stage production in New York. After traveling to Rome in an unsuccessful attempt to meet with Fellini, she created a one-woman play, In Search of Fellini.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons shorts first {{appeared}} in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. Another family member, Grampa <b>Simpson,</b> <b>was</b> introduced in the later shorts. Years later, during the early seasons of The Simpsons, {{when it came time}} to give Grampa a first name, Groening says he refused to name him after his own grandfather, Abraham Groening, leaving it to other writers to choose a name. By coincidence, they chose Abraham, unaware that it was the name of Groening's grandfather.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} originally asked Anthony Hopkins and Clint Eastwood {{to provide}} {{the voice of the}} dentist, Dr. Wolfe, but they both turned the role down. Anthony Perkins was later asked to fulfill the role and he agreed, but died before the role could be recorded. In the end, the role went to Simpsons regular Hank Azaria. As well, the original panelist on Smartline was supposed to be O. J. Simpson, but he turned it down, much to the relief of the writers when <b>Simpson</b> <b>was</b> later tried for murder.|$|E
5|$|Within days, <b>Simpson</b> <b>was</b> heading east again, {{taking a}} flying boat to Batavia, where {{he joined the}} advance party of the I Corps, which was being sent from the Middle East to the Dutch East Indies to counter the Japanese threat. He met there with the local {{authorities}} regarding signals arrangements for the defence of Java. These were soon well in hand, but the tactical situation rapidly deteriorated {{to the extent that}} the I Corps was ordered to leave Java on 21 February 1942. Simpson departed on the troop ship Orcades, which arrived in Adelaide on 14 March.|$|E
