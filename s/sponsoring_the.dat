5|$|The club first {{introduced}} shirt sponsorship in the 1985–86 season when future chairman Eddie Thompson's VG chain sponsored {{the club in}} the first of a two-year deal. A six-year association with Belhaven then ensued with a sponsorless 1993–94 season. Rover began a two-year deal early in time for the 1994 Scottish Cup final, <b>sponsoring</b> <b>the</b> club {{until the end of the}} 1995–96 season. Telewest took over sponsorship from 1996 for six years until Eddie Thompson's Morning, Noon and Night started <b>sponsoring</b> <b>the</b> club in 2002. This association continued until 2006 when Anglian Home Improvements began a two-year deal with an optional third year. At the same time, Ole International became the first shorts sponsors.

The society merged with other {{charitable}} organizations to form the Family Welfare Society of Indianapolis, a forerunner to the Family Service Association of Central Indiana and the United Way. The associated group organized charitable groups under a central leadership structure that allowed them to easily interact and better assist people by coordinating their efforts and identifying areas with the greatest need.|$|E

Other companies that were <b>sponsoring</b> <b>the</b> tournament were Coca-Cola, who committed Ksh. 6.5 million, and UAP Insurance, who committed Ksh. 5.5 million.|$|E
5|$|Promotion: A {{communication}} with the market should put stress on environmental aspects, for example that the company possesses a CP certificate or is ISO 14000 certified. This may be publicized to improve a firm’s image. Furthermore, {{the fact that a}} company spends expenditures on environmental protection should be advertised. Third, <b>sponsoring</b> <b>the</b> natural environment is also very important. And last but not least, ecological products will probably require special sales promotions.|$|E
5|$|To {{open the}} West to European immigration, {{parliament}} also approved <b>sponsoring</b> <b>the</b> construction of three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), opening the prairies to {{settlement with the}} Dominion Lands Act, and establishing the North-West Mounted Police to assert its authority over this territory.

5|$|During the war it {{had become}} clear that private {{patronage}} {{was no longer a}} practical means of sustaining Britain's musical life; a state body, the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts – the forerunner of the Arts Council – was established, and given a modest budget for public subsidy. The council made it a condition of <b>sponsoring</b> <b>the</b> LSO that the profit-sharing principle should be abandoned and the players made salaried employees. This renunciation of the principles for which the LSO had been founded was rejected by the players, and the offered subsidy was declined.|$|E
5|$|Further {{down the}} supply chain, members of The World Federation of Diamond Bourses (WFDB) {{act as a}} medium for {{wholesale}} diamond exchange, trading both polished and rough diamonds. The WFDB consists of independent diamond bourses in major cutting centers such as Tel Aviv, Antwerp, Johannesburg and other cities across the USA, Europe and Asia. In 2000, the WFDB and The International Diamond Manufacturers Association established the World Diamond Council to prevent the trading of diamonds used to fund war and inhumane acts. WFDB's additional activities include <b>sponsoring</b> <b>the</b> World Diamond Congress every two years, {{as well as the}} establishment of the International Diamond Council (IDC) to oversee diamond grading.|$|E
5|$|General Motors is <b>sponsoring</b> <b>the</b> Pecan Street {{demonstration}} project in Austin, Texas. The project {{objective is to}} learn the charging patterns of plug-in electric car owners, and to study how a residential fleet of electric vehicles might strain the electric grid if all owners try to charge them at the same, {{which is what the}} preliminary monitoring found when the plug-in cars return home in the evening. The Mueller neighborhood is the test ground, and , the community has nearly 60 Chevrolet Volt owners alone. This cluster of Volts was achieved thanks to GM's commitment to match the federal government's $7,500 rebate incentive, which effectively halves the purchase price of the plug-hybrid electric cars.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} when Monteverdi {{received}} the libretto from Badoaro, but this was presumably during or before 1639 since the work was being prepared for performance in the 1639–40 carnival. In keeping with the general character of Venetian opera, the work was written for a small band—around five string players and various continuo instruments. This reflected the financial motives of the merchant princes who were <b>sponsoring</b> <b>the</b> opera houses—they demanded commercial as well as artistic success, and wanted to minimise costs. As was common at the time, precise instrumentation is not indicated in the score, which exists in a single handwritten manuscript discovered in the Vienna National Library in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural Music City bowl {{marked the}} first meeting of Alabama and Virginia Tech on the {{football}} field since 1979, when the No. 1 Crimson Tide defeated Virginia Tech, 317. Prior to the Music City Bowl, Alabama had defeated Virginia Tech in all 10 meetings of the two schools, and some Virginia Tech players cited that record as motivation in the game. For American General, <b>sponsoring</b> <b>the</b> game was part of an overall marketing strategy intended to boost the company's national profile. Spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win the game by five points. In exchange for appearing in the game, each team received $750,000, minus expenses. Media coverage in {{the weeks leading up to}} the game focused on Virginia Tech's tough defense and Alabama's recovery from NCAA-imposed sanctions.|$|E
5|$|After Trump {{withdrew from}} <b>sponsoring</b> <b>the</b> event, DuPont became the primary sponsor. Between 1991 and 1995, {{national}} amateur teams took part alongside professional teams. The event attracted well-known competitors, including Lance Armstrong and Greg LeMond, and {{was attended by}} high-profile European-based professional cycling teams. In 1996, the Union Cycliste Internationale upgraded it to a 2.1 ranked race, meaning that amateurs could no longer compete. This made the race the highest ranked outside of Europe and the first North American stage race to be ranked 2.1. The 1996 race {{was the subject of}} a number of legal issues, including a dispute over rights to its profits between the race owners, Billy Packer and president of the United States Cycling Federation Mike Plant, which resulted in them suing each other. DuPont itself was involved in a dispute about the anti-homosexual employment policies of the local government in Greenville, South Carolina, with the company insisting that the race organizers exclude the city from the route. After 1996, DuPont dropped its sponsorship and the race has not been run since.|$|E
