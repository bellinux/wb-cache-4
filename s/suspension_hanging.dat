40|$|Pluripotent human {{embryonic}} stem cell (hESC) lines are a promising model system in developmental and tissue regeneration research. Differentiation of hESCs towards the three germ layers and finally tissue specific cell types is often performed through the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs) in <b>suspension</b> or <b>hanging</b> droplet culture systems. However, these systems are inefficient regarding embryoid body (EB) formation, structural support to the EB and long term differentiation capacity. The present study investigates if agarose, as a semi solid matrix, can facilitate EB formation and support differentiation of hESC lines. The results showed that agarose culture is able to enhance EB formation efficiency with 10 % and increase EB growth by 300 %. The agarose culture system was able to maintain expression of the three germ layers over 8 Â weeks of culture. All of the four hESC lines tested developed EBs in the agarose system although with a histological heterogeneity between cell lines as well as within cell lines. In conclusion, a 3 -D agarose culture of spherical hESC colonies improves EB formation and growth in a cost effective, stable and non-laborious technique...|$|R

40|$|AbstractApplications of {{differentiated}} progeny {{generated from}} {{human embryonic stem}} cells (hESCs) broadly span cell replacement therapies and screening studies (toxicology, disease-drug modeling). These applications require differentiation into lineage-specific cell types from hESCs that are largely dependent on several reported embryoid body (EB) formation methods. However, methodologies for in vitro EB differentiation have not been quantitatively evaluated and compared. Using the hematopoietic lineage as a test for differentiation competency, we performed multiparameter comparisons of three prevalent EB methods: (1) <b>suspension</b> (SP), (2) <b>hanging</b> drop (HD), and (3) forced aggregation (FA). Although FA improved the homogeneity between hEBs, the highest hematopoietic induction efficiencies were observed in EBs formed in SP culture independent of {{the presence or absence}} of serum. Despite the EB formation method used, EB-based hematopoietic differentiation could be potently influenced by EB size and was augmented by paracrine signaling between cocultured EBs. Our study identifies physical and physiological parameters contributing to the efficiency of hESC differentiation in EB formats and reveals that EB methods are best tailored to specific applications unique to cell replacement vs small molecule screening or early human development...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesDeaths {{in police}} custody are a global {{phenomenon}} {{which continues to}} beset policing services worldwide. Research into these deaths has provided insight into the complexity of detention {{and led to the}} institution of preventative strategies which have seen a reduction in mortality internationally. An improved understanding of the South African detention milieu may similarly assist in reducing the mortality burden in this country. This study retrospectively reviewed deaths in custody in the Cape Town Western Metropole between 2000 and 2009, with the aim of identifying local, modifiable factors to aid in death prevention. Sixty two (62) cases were reviewed. Males predominated (90. 3 %) in the sample, with the racial profile mirroring that of the general population. The median age of the detainees was 30. 5 years. Unnatural causes of death accounted for 82 % (n= 51) of cases, with suicidal hanging the commonest cause (n= 40). Items of clothing were used as ligatures in 80 % of hangings, with gate and window bars the most common points of suspension. Time in detention averaged 863 minutes for the sample. Clinical signs of intoxication at the time of arrest was identified as a statistically significant determinant (p= 0. 02) of a shorter detention time (446 minutes). Ten (10) detainees were identified as either injured at the time of arrest or physically ill during detention, of which 9 succumbed to their injuries or disease. Only three of these detainees received medical attention. These findings highlight the need for urgent review of local police cell architecture to ensure an environment conducive to safe detention, with particular attention to reducing potential points of <b>suspension</b> for <b>hangings.</b> Further, the healthcare needs of detainees must be prioritised through effective training of police personnel with regard to the assessment and management of ill detainees, particularly those intoxicated at the time of arrest...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{importance}} {{to get a}} correct measurement of all variables involved in different metrological processes, takes major importance every day. In order to improve the uncertainty of some processes in metrology of density, the surface tension (ST) arises as the new important one in the uncertainty budget. In density measurements different variables like {{the properties of the}} liquids are involved (density, viscosity, compressibility coefficient, and surface tension), especially for the reference materials used for the calibration of hydrometers, and their characterization in density (density calibration). The ST appears in those methods were a <b>suspension</b> wire is <b>hanging</b> from a balance {{and at the same time}} is holding a solid (density standard or a mass) which is introduced/immersed into a liquid. This method is usually known as hydrostatic weighing. Nowadays there are diverse methods for the determination of the ST, and various devices to do these measurements based on these methods. The present work focuses on two methods to measure the ST (Method of rupture and hydrostatic weighing method), whose modifications and adjustments were realized in order to reduce the uncertainties of the resulting values. In this paper the measurement systems an...|$|R
50|$|The necks {{of hanging}} {{participants}} are usually marked with furrows where the ligature had constricted the neck. An inverted V mark is also often seen. Because {{of the pressure}} on the jaw, the tongue is sometimes protruding, causing it to dry. Depending on the circumstances, petechiae may be present on the eyes, face, legs, and feet. Cervical spine fractures are rare unless the hanging is a drop hanging, which usually causes an injury known as hangman's fracture. <b>Suspension</b> <b>hanging</b> usually results in cerebral hypoxia and decreased muscle tone around the neck. According to Aufderheide et al., {{the most common cause of}} death of hangings is cerebral hypoxia.|$|E
5000|$|Hanging {{is divided}} into <b>suspension</b> <b>hanging</b> and the much rarer drop hanging; this method can kill in various ways. Suicide attempters who survive, because the cord or {{ligature}} point breaks, or because they are discovered and cut down can face a range of serious injuries, including cerebral anoxia (which can lead to permanent brain damage), laryngeal fracture, cervical spine fracture, tracheal fracture, pharyngeal laceration, and carotid artery injury. Ron M. Brown writes that hanging has a [...] "fairly imperspicuous and complicated symbolic history". There are commentaries on hanging in antiquity, and it has various cultural interpretations. Throughout history, numerous famous people have committed suicide by hanging.|$|E
50|$|The aim of drop hanging, {{which is}} also {{frequently}} used in executions, is to break the neck. Participants fall vertically with a rope attached to their neck, which when taut applies a force sufficient to break the spinal cord, causing death. The length of the drop, usually between five and nine feet long, is calculated such that it is long enough to allow a less painful death, but short enough to avoid a decapitation. This form of suicide is much rarer than <b>suspension</b> <b>hanging</b> {{and is likely to}} be less painful. It can be done by affixing {{the other end of the}} rope to a fixed structure located at least 3 meters high, e.g. a balcony railing on a building, and jumping down with the noose around oneâs neck.|$|E
40|$|In {{forensic}} practice, it {{is required}} to distinguish between suicidal or accidental hanging and simulated hanging. Conventional macroscopic and histological findings may be unreliable; vital signs are often absent, {{and they can be}} produced postmortem. The application of immunohistochemical techniques opened up a new field of investigation in the issue of ligature marks. We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of a panel of cytokines and inflammatory cells in skin specimens in autopsy cases of death due to hanging, to discuss their significance in assessing whether hanging mark and signs occurred before or after the death of the victim. We selected 21 cases in which broad, soft and yielding materials were used and 28 cases in which materials used for hanging were hard. The control group included the following 21 cases: 14 cases of sudden cardiac death and 7 cases of post- mortem <b>hanging</b> (<b>suspension)</b> of bodies (drug overdose or suffocation as cause of death in all the cases). An immunohistochemical investigation of skin samples was performed utilizing antibodies anti-tryptase, fibronectin, TNFÎ±, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10, MCP- 1, IL- 15, IL- 1 Ã, CD 45, CD 4, CD 3, CD 8, CD 68, CD 20, CD 15. We conclude that tryptase, IL- 15, and CD 15 appear to be reliable parameters in the determination of ligature marksâ vitality with the accuracy needed for forensic purposes. This fact especially applies to soft marks which are particularly difficult to evaluate on the basis of gross examination and of conventional histological studies...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to rope, other materials {{can easily be}} fashioned into an improvised noose e.g. a bed-sheet, ripped T-shirt, shoelaces or telephone extension cable. Regardless of the material used to form the noose, <b>suspension</b> <b>hanging</b> will kill its victims in three ways: compression of the carotid arteries, the jugular veins, or the airway. About 11 lb of pressure is required to compress the carotid artery; 4.4 lb for the jugular veins; and at least 15 kg for the airway. The {{amount of time it}} takes to lose consciousness and die is difficult to predict accurately and depends on several factors. Some believe unconsciousness occurs in five seconds, though Alan Gunn writes that it generally takes longer. It took a man who filmed his hanging 13 seconds to become unconscious, 1 minute and 38 seconds to lose muscle tone, and 4 minutes and 10 seconds for muscle movement to cease. Full suspension is not required; most hanging suicides are done by partial suspension, according to Wyatt et al. Geo Stone, author of Suicide and Attempted Suicide: Methods and Consequences, suggests that death by obstruction of the airway is more painful than by the other ways.|$|E
