50|$|Scrapers are {{typically}} formed by chipping {{the end of}} a flake of stone in order to create one sharp side and to keep the rest of the sides dull to facilitate grasping it. Most scrapers are either circle or blade-like in shape. The working edges of scrapers tend to be convex, and many have trimmed and dulled lateral edges to facilitate hafting. One important variety of scraper is the thumbnail scraper, a scraper shaped much like its namesake. This scraper type is common at Paleo-Indian sites in North America.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} COFFE (Circuit Optimiza-tion For FPGA Exploration), a new fully-automated {{transistor}} <b>sizing</b> <b>tool</b> for FPGAs. Automated transistor-level CAD tools {{are an important}} part of the architecture exploration flow because they provide accurate area and delay estimates of low-level FPGA circuitry, which must be obtained for each architecture. We show that modeling transistors as linear resistances and capacitances as has been done in previous FPGA transistor <b>sizing</b> <b>tools</b> is highly inaccurate for fine-grained transistor-level design in advanced process nodes. Therefore, COFFE’s transistor sizing algorithm maintains circuit non-linearities by relying exclusively on HSPICE simulations to measure delay. Area is estimated with a transistor size-based model that incorporates a number of improvements to enhance its accuracy in advanced process technologies versus prior methods. In addition to more accurate area and delay estimation, COFFE considers more layout effects than prior published work by automatically accounting for tran-sistor and wire loads, which are computed based on architectural parameters and layout area. This new FPGA transistor <b>sizing</b> <b>tool</b> requires only several hours to produce high-quality transistor sizing results for an entire FPGA tile; a task that would normally take months of manual effort.

40|$|AbstractSingle point {{incremental}} forming (SPIF) {{is a new}} {{innovative and}} feasible solution for the rapid prototyping and the manufacturing of small batch sheet parts. The process is carried out at room temperature and requires a CNC machining centre, a spherical headed tool and a simple support to fix the sheet being formed. In incremental Sheet Metal Forming the blank is incrementally deformed in to a desirable shape by hemispherical or ball nose tool traveling along a prescribed path. Due to the various advantages including the reduced production cost and time of prototypes, improved formability, easy modification of part design etc. the ISF is being popular as a new innovative forming technology.

40|$|A {{discussion}} of Systems Engineering tools brings out numerous preferences and reactions regarding tools of choice {{as well as}} the functions those tools are to perform. A recent study of Systems Engineering Tools for a new Program illustrated the need for a generic template for use by new Programs or Projects to determine the toolset appropriate for their use. This paper will provide the guidelines new initiatives can follow and tailor to their specific needs, to enable them to make their choice of tools in an efficient and informed manner. Clearly, those who perform purely technical functions will need different tools than those who perform purely systems engineering functions. And, everyone has tools they are comfortable with. That degree of comfort is frequently the deciding factor in tools choice rather than an objective study of all criteria and weighting factors. This paper strives to produce a comprehensive list of criteria for selection with suggestions for weighting factors based on a number of assumptions regarding the given Program or Project. In addition, any given Program will begin with assumptions for its toolset based on Program <b>size,</b> <b>tool</b> cost, user base and technical needs. In providing a template for tool selection, this paper will guide the reader through assumptions based on Program need; decision criteria; potential weighting factors; the need for a compilation of available tools; the importance of tool demonstrations; and finally a down selection of tools. While specific vendors cannot be mentioned in this work, it is expected that this template could serve other Programs in the formulation phase by alleviating the trade study process of some of its subjectivity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Crows and ravens (Passeriformes: Corvus) are large-brained {{birds with}} {{enhanced}} cognitive abilities {{relative to other}} birds. They are among the few non-hominid organisms on Earth to be considered intelligent and well-known examples exist of several crow species having evolved innovative strategies and even use of tools {{in their search for}} food. The 40 Corvus species have also been successful dispersers and are distributed on most continents and in remote archipelagos. Results This study presents the first molecular phylogeny including all species and a number of subspecies within the genus Corvus. We date the phylogeny and determine ancestral areas to investigate historical biogeographical patterns of the crows. Additionally, we use data on brain size and a large database on innovative behaviour and tool use to test whether brain size (i) explains innovative behaviour and success in applying tools when foraging and (ii) has some correlative role in the success of colonization of islands. Our results demonstrate that crows originated in the Palaearctic in the Miocene from where they dispersed to North America and the Caribbean, Africa and Australasia. We find that relative brain size alone does not explain tool use, innovative feeding strategies and dispersal success within crows. Conclusions Our study supports monophyly of the genus Corvus and further demonstrates the direction and timing of colonization from the area of origin in the Palaearctic to other continents and archipelagos. The Caribbean was probably colonized from North America, although some North American ancestor may have gone extinct, and the Pacific was colonized multiple times from Asia and Australia. We did not find a correlation between relative brain <b>size,</b> <b>tool</b> use, innovative feeding strategies and dispersal success. Hence, we propose that all crows and ravens have relatively large brains compared to other birds and thus the potential to be innovative if conditions and circumstances are right. </p...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{discharge}} of patients from {{the intensive care}} unit (ICU) to a hospital ward is a common transition of care that is associated with error and adverse events. Risk stratification tools may help identify high-risk patients for targeted interventions, but it is unclear if proper tools have been developed. METHODS: We searched Ovid EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, PUBMED and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the earliest available date through March 2013, plus reference lists and citations of all studies included in the systematic review. Cohort studies were selected that described the derivation, validation or clinical impact of tools for predicting medical emergency team activation, ICU readmission or mortality following patient discharge from the ICU. Data were extracted on the study design, setting, population, sample <b>size,</b> <b>tool</b> (components, measurement properties) and outcomes. RESULTS: The literature search identified 9, 926 citations, of which eight studies describing eight tools met the inclusion criteria. Reported outcomes included ICU readmission (n= 4 studies), hospital mortality (n= 3 studies) and both ICU readmission and hospital mortality (n= 1 studies). Seven of the tools were comprised of distinct measurable component variables, while one tool used subjective scoring of patient risk by intensive care physicians. The areas under receiver operator curves were reported for all studies and ranged from 0. 66 to 0. 92. A single study provided a direct comparative analysis between two tools. We did not find any studies evaluating the impact of risk prediction on processes and outcomes of care. CONCLUSIONS: Eight risk stratification tools for predicting severe adverse events following patient discharge from ICU have been developed, but have undergone limited comparative evaluation. Although risk stratification tools may help clinician decision-making, further evaluation of the existing tools' effects on care is required prior to clinical implementation...|$|E

40|$|Presented at the 2002 Missile Sciences Conference, Monterrey, CA, November 5 - 7, 2002. This paper {{illustrates}} {{the use of}} a conceptual <b>sizing</b> <b>tool</b> for the design of tactical missiles. The <b>sizing</b> <b>tool,</b> called the Tactical Missile Design (TMD) spreadsheet, was developed to allow the user to quickly generate estimates of a missile configuration?s performance and other measures of merit such as lethality. This capability allows the user to get a first order estimate of a missile?s ability to meet a set of requirements and allows for fast trade-studies to quickly identify the performance drivers of a system. In order to generate reasonable estimates for missile range and speed, a <b>sizing</b> <b>tool</b> must have analysis methods for aerodynamics, propulsion, weight, and trajectory. In order for the <b>sizing</b> <b>tool</b> to remain useful for conceptual tradeoffs, these analyses must be robust enough to handle a wide range of inputs, yet simple enough to be executed quickly. The analysis methods were constructed with these requirements in mind. The aerodynamics analysis is based upon several physics-derived analytical expressions as outlined in the text ?Tactical Missile Design? by Eugene Fleeman. Propulsion uses a simplified cycle analysis to relate engine parameters (maximum inlet temperature, fuel heating value, expansion ratio) to overall specific impulse (Isp). The propulsion analysis can handle either air-breathing and solid-rocket systems, or a combination thereof. For trajectory, a constant flight path is assumed, with a boost, cruise, and coast phase. These straightforward analysis methods combine to produce a very powerful, yet robust, conceptual missile design tool. The paper first lays out the analysis methods, assumptions, and limitations in the Tactical Missile Design spreadsheet. Next, a comparison is made between the results of the TMD spreadsheet and the performance of historical missile systems. In addition, the paper explores some example trade studies to identify the drivers of a rocket and a ramjet missile system. Finally, the TMD spreadsheet is used to show how easily a tactical missile can be optimized at the conceptual level...|$|R

40|$|Sliding {{shoulder}} {{friction stir welding}} (SSFSW) is {{an alternative}} joining technique to the conventional friction stir welding process. The welding mechanism comprises of a rotating probe and a non-rotating shoulder. The shoulder therefore does not contribute to any heat generation or plastic deformation. When welding thicker section material, the contribution of heat generation from the shoulder becomes less significant {{and most of the}} heat and plastic deformation must be generated by the tool probe. For this reason it was decided to develop the process for thick section AA 6082 -T 6. Due to the stationary (non-rotating) shoulder the weld track is smooth and there is no reduction in cross-sectional area. This research is based on the development of a sliding shoulder friction stir welding tool with the ability to create joints of up to 25 mm thick on aluminium alloy 6082 -T 6 plate as well as the associated process development. The sliding shoulder friction stir welding tool was designed, manufactured and tested by initially performing partial penetration welds with various <b>size</b> <b>tool</b> probes and then finally by performing a sliding shoulder friction stir butt weld on 25 mm thick plate. As welds were performed and more knowledge gained about the process, design modifications were made. These included varying the clearance between the tool probe and stationary shoulder; the profile of the shoulder which contributes to material flow during the process; and supporting the tool probe to prevent deflection when welding thicker sections at high forge forces. From the sliding shoulder friction stir welds performed, an understanding of material flow during the process was gained when analysing the macro-sections and exit holes of the welds. Typical process forces and torques associated with the process were measured to assist with future head unit and tool designs with regard to sliding shoulder friction stir welding...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A detailed study {{has been made of}} titanium carbide (TiC) coatings chemically vapour deposited on powder metallurgy (PM) BT 42 grade high speed steel (HSS) indexable cutting tool inserts, in collaboration with Edgar Allen Tools, Sheffield. Initially, the characteristics of a TiC coating deposited under the standard conditions employed by Edgar Allen Tools were determined, {{both before and after the}} obligatory HSS substrate heat treatment. This was done using various techniques including x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, micro-hardness testing, profilometry, optical microscopy and scratch-adhesion testing. Although the characteristics of the TiC coating were found not to be significantly affected by the HSS substrate heat treatment, some of them were different to those presented in the literature for TiC coatings chemically vapour deposited on cemented carbide substrates. A comprehensive survey of the literature revealed that the process parameters employed during the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of TiC coatings, particularly the CHy/TiCly mole ratio and deposition temperature, have a significant effect on coating characteristics. Consequently, it was decided to investigate the effect of these parameters on the characteristics of the TIC coatings chemically vapour deposited on the PM HSS inserts and, further, their effect on the tool lives exhibited by the coated inserts. The latter were determined from a series of turning tests on 817 M 40 workpiece material, carried out under conditions of builtup- edge (bue) formation, at cutting speeds in the range 37. 5 - 60 m min 1. Both process parameters were found to have a marked effect on the characteristics of the TiC coatings and on the tool lives exhibited by the coated inserts. The reasons for this are discussbd. The TiC coated inserts which displayed the most favourable combination of coating characteristics and tool life were used in two further series of turning tests carried out to investigate tool wear, bue <b>size,</b> <b>tool</b> forces, apparent coefficient of friction and workpiece surface finish.

40|$|The Building Construction Products (BCP) Division of Caterpillar makes 12 {{different}} loader, excavator, and tractor {{products with}} 10 manufacturing facilities worldwide. With relatively high volume machines, BCP saw that their supply base {{continued to have}} challenges in managing their inventory levels when machine volume and mix would change. Challenges included poor Supplier Shipping Performance (SSP), Point of Use (POU) availability, and inventory turns. These failures translated into poor Committed Ship Date (CSD) performance; which also directly impacted the overall cost of production and profitability of BCP. For example, {{coming out of the}} 2009 recession, suppliers were unable to keep up with BCP's increasing demand; which was attributed to supplier's lack of confidence in the BCP forecast, and only reviewing a 13 -week capacity outlook. Therefore, BCP would like to have visibility into their supplier's planning processes, and through enhanced collaboration and communication, improve both BCP and their supplier's performance. To obtain the expected result, the scope of the project was to evaluate the Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP) processes of two identified suppliers. While the primary goal of the project was to develop a robust BCP Supplier S&OP process, the performance improvements were generated from Inventory and Operations Management tool creation and process improvement. The project followed the 6 Sigma approach of DMAIC to clearly evaluate the S&OP processes at both BCP Leicester and the two identified suppliers. The study concluded, through the development of a Supplier S&OP process that there were several important factors hindering the implementation of S&OP. These factors included capacity planning, planning parameters and inventory management policies. To enable implementation, the following tools were created: 1. Capacity Planning Tool enabled £ 30 k annual cost avoidance on labor, logistics, and equipment through proactive management and scenario planning 2. Batch <b>Size</b> <b>Tool</b> enabled £ 20 k+ reduction of inventory holding costs while also reducing near-term schedule variation to 2 nd tier supplier 3. Safety Stock Tool provided inventory levels to align customer service with lead-times Through looking at the current BCP S&OP process at Caterpillar several key issues were identified with the quality of the output. These included lack of accountability for forecast accuracy and a lack of clear BCP Supply Chain strategy. To improve the identified issues the following actions were taken: 1.
