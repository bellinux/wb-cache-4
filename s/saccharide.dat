30|$|Herein, we {{describe}} a convenient and highly efficient magnetic solution that can selectively enrich <b>saccharides</b> in one step for glycomic analysis. In this approach, 2 -(2 -aminoethoxy) ethanol-blocked phenylboronic acid-functionalized Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles (blocked PMNPs) with high magnetic responsibility were fabricated. The phenylboronic acid (PBA) group can specifically recognize the cis-diols moieties of <b>saccharides,</b> forming a reversible covalent boronate ester bond (Kaur et al. 2006; Springsteen and Wang 2002; Yan et al. 2004). The blocking molecule, 2 -(2 -aminoethoxy) ethanol, can deplete nonspecific binding during the separation process. The enriched <b>saccharides</b> were detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), {{which is a}} high-throughput platform with high sensitivity, (Caprioli et al. 1997; Franc et al. 2012) desired salt tolerance, and allowing for detailed analysis of <b>saccharides</b> structures (Jeong et al. 2012; Selman et al. 2012). Unlike currently used methods, the enriched <b>saccharides</b> on the PMNPs can be directly analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS without extra steps to remove the PMNPs. For <b>saccharides</b> analysis, the PMNPs method was utilized to isolate different types of <b>saccharides,</b> including simple sugar, N-glycans, and oligosaccharides.|$|R

In addition, many <b>saccharide</b> units can undergo various chemical modifications, such as amination, and can even form parts of other molecules, such as glycoproteins.|$|E
25|$|Pectins, {{also known}} as pectic polysaccharides, are rich in galacturonic acid. Several {{distinct}} polysaccharides have been identified and characterised within the pectic group. Homogalacturonans are linear chains of α-(1–4)-linked D-galacturonic acid. Substituted galacturonans are characterized {{by the presence of}} <b>saccharide</b> appendant residues (such as D-xylose or D-apiose in the respective cases of xylogalacturonan and apiogalacturonan) branching from a backbone of D-galacturonic acid residues. Rhamnogalacturonan I pectins (RG-I) contain a backbone of the repeating disaccharide: 4)-α-D-galacturonic acid-(1,2)-α-L-rhamnose-(1. From many of the rhamnose residues, sidechains of various neutral sugars branch off. The neutral sugars are mainly D-galactose, L-arabinose and D-xylose, with the types and proportions of neutral sugars varying with the origin of pectin.|$|E

40|$|<b>Saccharides</b> and {{furfural}} {{are derived}} from biomass burning and contribute to aerosol composition. This study examined the potential of <b>saccharides</b> and furfural to be tracers of biomass combustion. Furfural {{is likely to be}} oxidized quickly so comparison with <b>saccharides</b> may give a sense of the age of the aerosols in biomass smoke. However, few furfural emissions are available for biomass combustion. <b>Saccharides</b> and furfural were determined in coarse aerosols (diameter> 2. 4 /lm) and fine aerosols (diameter < 2. 4 /lm) collected in 24 hour periods during different seasons in the United Kingdom and PMIO collected from Thailand and Malaysia including biomass burning areas such as haze episodes and forest fires. Also total suspended particulate matter (TSP) was collected from Taiwan. <b>Saccharides</b> and furfural dominated in fine fractions, especially in the UK autumn. The Principle component analysis showed that the fine mode UK aerosols probably originate from long-range transport emissions from Europe. This was also an important contribution for the crustal group and the biomass burning emission. Sea salt and combustion emission may contribute to coarse mode aerosols. Fraction of <b>saccharides</b> and furfural in aerosols were higher during Southeast Asian haze episodes and forest fires. They were also correlated to potassium and total carbon. Collection of aerosol particles led to blackening on filter papers. The oxidation processes in the atmosphere may lead to more yellowness of aerosols. The yellowness of aerosols collected from forest fires correlated with <b>saccharides</b> and furfural. This may indicate that the organic carbons from forest fires are related to the oxidation process. Although the emission rates of <b>saccharides</b> and furfural from biomass burning were found to have similar levels, furfural was detected at low concentration suggesting loss from atmospheric aerosols. Laboratory experimental simulation suggested furfural is more rapid destroyed by UV, sunlight and ozone than <b>saccharides.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Normally the {{detection}} of biologically important molecules such as <b>saccharides</b> is difficult.

2500|$|The term is {{most common}} in biochemistry, where it is a synonym of 'saccharide', a group that {{includes}} sugars, starch, and cellulose. The saccharides are divided into four chemical groups: monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. Monosaccharides and disaccharides, the smallest (lower molecular weight) carbohydrates, are [...] {{commonly referred to as}} sugars. The word <b>saccharide</b> comes from the Greek word σάκχαρον (sákkharon), meaning [...] "sugar". While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex, the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix -ose. For example, grape sugar is the monosaccharide glucose, cane sugar is the disaccharide sucrose, and milk sugar is the disaccharide lactose.|$|E
2500|$|In sucrose, the {{components}} glucose and fructose are linked via an ether bond between C1 on the glucosyl subunit and C2 on the fructosyl unit. The bond {{is called a}} glycosidic linkage. Glucose exists predominantly as two isomeric [...] "pyranoses" [...] (α and β), but {{only one of these}} forms links to the fructose. Fructose itself exists as a mixture of [...] "furanoses", each of which having α and β isomers, but only one particular isomer links to the glucosyl unit. What is notable about sucrose is that, unlike most disaccharides, the glycosidic bond is formed between the reducing ends of both glucose and fructose, and not between the reducing end of one and the nonreducing end of the other. This linkage inhibits further bonding to other <b>saccharide</b> units. Since it contains no anomeric hydroxyl groups, it is classified as a non-reducing sugar.|$|E

2500|$|Nutritionists often {{refer to}} {{carbohydrates}} as either simple or complex. However, the exact distinction between these groups can be ambiguous. The term complex carbohydrate {{was first used}} in the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs publication Dietary Goals for the United States (1977) where {{it was intended to}} distinguish sugars from other carbohydrates (which were perceived to be nutritionally superior). However, the report put [...] "fruit, vegetables and whole-grains" [...] in the complex carbohydrate column, despite the fact that these may contain sugars as well as polysaccharides. This confusion persists as today some nutritionists use the term complex carbohydrate to refer to any sort of digestible <b>saccharide</b> present in a whole food, where fiber, vitamins and minerals are also found (as opposed to processed carbohydrates, which provide energy but few other nutrients). The standard usage, however, is to classify carbohydrates chemically: simple if they are sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) and complex if they are polysaccharides (or oligosaccharides).|$|E
2500|$|Bacteria in a person's mouth convert glucose, fructose, {{and most}} {{commonly}} sucrose (table sugar) into acids such as lactic acid through a glycolytic process called fermentation. If left {{in contact with}} the tooth, these acids may cause demineralization, which is the dissolution of its mineral content. [...] The process is dynamic, however, as remineralization can also occur if the acid is neutralized by saliva or mouthwash. [...] Fluoride toothpaste or dental varnish may aid remineralization. [...] If demineralization continues over time, enough mineral content may be lost so that the soft organic material left behind disintegrates, forming a cavity or hole. The impact such sugars have on the progress of dental caries is called cariogenicity. Sucrose, although a bound glucose and fructose unit, is in fact more cariogenic than a mixture of equal parts of glucose and fructose. This is due to the bacteria utilising the energy in the <b>saccharide</b> bond between the glucose and fructose subunits.
