"The Gold-Bug" [...] {{includes}} a cipher {{that uses a}} <b>simple</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher.</b> Though he did not invent [...] "secret writing" [...] or cryptography (he was probably inspired by an interest in Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe), Poe certainly popularized it during his time. To {{most people in the}} 19th century, cryptography was mysterious and those able to break the codes were considered gifted with nearly supernatural ability. Poe had drawn attention to it as a novelty over four months in the Philadelphia publication Alexander's Weekly Messenger in 1840. He had asked readers to submit their own substitution ciphers, boasting he could solve all of them with little effort. The challenge brought about, as Poe wrote, [...] "a very lively interest among the numerous readers of the journal. Letters poured in upon the editor {{from all parts of the}} country." [...] In July 1841, Poe published [...] "A Few Words on Secret Writing" [...] and, realizing the interest in the topic, wrote [...] "The Gold-Bug" [...] as one of the few pieces of literature to incorporate ciphers as part of the story. Poe's character Legrand's explanation of his ability to solve the cipher is [...] very like [...] Poe's explanation in [...] "A Few Words on Secret Writing".|$|E

[...] Abrams also revealed that the seemingly unrelated frogs which have the Greek letter Phi (Φ) imprinted on their back appeared in promos for the show have significance {{within the context of the}} series, saying [...] "it's part of the code of the show." [...] The glyph code was cracked by an editor at the technology site Ars Technica, who discovered it to be a <b>simple</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>cipher</b> used to spell out a single thematic word for each episode; for example, the pilot episode's eight glyphs spell out the word [...] "observer". Whether there is a further second-order code to be solved remains to be seen. Additionally, the glyphs are representative of some of the means by which Walter solves a case (such as the moth/butterfly from [...] "Johari Window", the seahorse strain of DNA from [...] "The Bishop Revival").

40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} the applications of two swarm-inspired artificial life optimization techniques in cryptology. In particular, {{we investigate}} {{the use of}} both Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for automated cryptanalysis of <b>simple</b> classical <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers.</b> We also use PSO to construct Boolean functions with some desirable cryptographic properties. Both ACO and PSO based attacks proved to be effective for the cryptanalysis of <b>simple</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>ciphers</b> encoded with various sets of encoding keys. Purely uni-gram and bi-gram statistics are used for solving this problem. Boolean functions are vital components of symmetric-key ciphers such as block ciphers, stream ciphers and hash functions. When used in cipher systems, Boolean functions should satisfy several cryptographic properties such as balance, high nonlinearity, resiliency and high algebraic degree. Using PSO, with an unorthodox approach of spectral inversion, {{we are able to}} construct Boolean functions that achieve the maximum possible nonlinearity (Bent function) and several other important resilient functions. In fact, we were able to construct, for the first time, a 9 -variable Boolean function with nonlinearity 240, algebraic degree 5, and resiliency degree 3. This construction affirmatively answers the open problem about the existence of such function...|$|R

By adding 8 bits (one byte) for each byte using a function and another mathematical function to position the bits in a binary tree and using its in-order tour, this cipher can be made protected. Using an in-order tour of binary tree can diffuse the eight bits (includes 7 bits produced by the function and 1 random bit) and eight bits of the plaintext. This can highly protect the cipher. However, if the key management processes are not secured the strongest ciphers can easily be broken...|$|R
