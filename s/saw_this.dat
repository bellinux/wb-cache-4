5|$|After {{the judges}} {{returned}} home, Lawrence {{was made a}} Baron for his work at Nuremberg, but Birkett received nothing. The lack of reward for his work pushed him into depression, which he took many months to recover from. He was eventually made a Privy Counsellor in the 1947 Birthday Honours list, but he <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> as poor reward for the work he had put in at Nuremberg.|$|E
5|$|Bo {{took up the}} Chongqing post on 30 November, a month {{following}} {{the conclusion of the}} Congress, even though Wang Yang had vacated the position on 13 November. Whilst some <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> transfer as a 'banishment' from the central government to the hinterlands to keep Bo's perceived arrogance and high-profile antics out of Beijing's view, others considered it a promotion since being the party chief in one of the four direct-controlled municipalities came with an ex officio seat on the Politburo.|$|E

60|$|I <b>saw</b> in <b>this,</b> wretched {{though it}} made me, and bitter {{the sense of}} {{dependence}} and even of degradation that it awakened,--I <b>saw</b> in <b>this</b> that Estella was set to wreak Miss Havisham's revenge on men, {{and that she was}} not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term. I <b>saw</b> in <b>this,</b> a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her out to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers, and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I <b>saw</b> in <b>this</b> that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even while the prize was reserved for me. I <b>saw</b> in <b>this</b> the reason for my being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian's declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme. In a word, I <b>saw</b> in <b>this</b> Miss Havisham as I had her then and there before my eyes, and always had had her before my eyes; and I <b>saw</b> in <b>this,</b> the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden from the sun.|$|R
6000|$|... "Courage of the body, nothing, Maiden; {{courage of}} the spirit much, perhaps. If thou <b>sawest</b> <b>this</b> lover of thine, and knew for certain that he lives on beneath the world {{awaiting}} thee, would it bring thee comfort?" ...|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} Sri Lanka became {{independent}} in 1948, about {{sixty percent of}} government jobs were held by Tamils, who formed barely fifteen percent of the population. The elected Sinhalese leaders of the country <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> {{as the result of}} a British stratagem to control the majority Sinhalese, and deemed it a situation that needed correction by implementation of the Policy of standardization.|$|E
5|$|Early critics, such as Thomas Campbell in 1838, <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> {{constant}} {{allusion to}} the theatre as an indication that Prospero was meant to represent Shakespeare; the character's renunciation of magic thus signalling Shakespeare's farewell to the stage. This theory persists among later critics, and remains solidly within the critical canon.|$|E
5|$|He won {{his first}} five decisions, a streak snapped May 22 by the New York Mets. He {{followed}} with another five-game win streak, the last coming against the Mets on June 19. After missing a start, he <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> win streak {{come to an end}} June 29 against the Seattle Mariners.|$|E
50|$|In 1879 Reeves {{worked in}} a sawmill in Columbus. He noticed that workers could not control {{the speed of the}} pulleys used to power the <b>saws.</b> <b>This</b> caused the wood to split and a large amount of wastage. After some months of study and experimentation, Reeves invented a variable-speed {{transmission}} to control the saws speed.|$|R
50|$|In 1939, the {{workforce}} was 6 persons. By late 1945, this {{had risen to}} 8. The first machines built at the plant were ones for woodworking, such as firewood cutting machines, carpenter's circular saws, wood drilling machines and long band <b>saws.</b> <b>This</b> production stopped in 1945 after more than 200 machines had been completed.|$|R
60|$|Granbury Lapham had had {{practically}} {{no experience with}} horses and in the present trying emergency he was as helpless as an infant. He <b>sawed</b> <b>this</b> way and that on the reins, and yelled {{at the top of}} his lungs. This merely served to frighten the steeds still more, and away they sprang at a greater speed than ever.|$|R
5|$|In July 1941, Blenheims from Bomber Command's No. 2 Group {{joined the}} campaign. They claimed 104 vessels sunk and 72 damaged. Only 73 vessels totalling 178,000 tons were {{credited}} destroyed and 62 vessels, totalling 96,780 tons damaged. Intelligence in August 1941 <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> drop to 31 destroyed (73,348 tons) and 58 (148,000 tons) damaged. Post-war assessments reveal even this was over stated. Final figures were seven sunk (9,556 tons) and six (13,088) seriously damaged.|$|E
5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the neutralization of the 'either/or'. The dialectic structure of becoming renders existence far too easy, in Hegel's theory, because conflicts are eventually mediated and disappear automatically through a natural process that requires no individual choice {{other than a}} submission {{to the will of}} the Idea or Geist. Kierkegaard <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> as a denial of true selfhood and instead advocated the importance of personal responsibility and choice-making.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{highlighted}} {{the failure of}} EMPG, the holding company for US publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and the potential impact on the Irish taxpayers of the loans given by Anglo Irish Bank to the investors in EMPG on 13 January 2010. Lee <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> as another example for the urgent need of {{an investigation into the}} Irish banking crisis.|$|E
5000|$|Dōzuki [...] - [...] a Japanese backsaw, {{used for}} centuries by {{carpenters}} and cabinetmakers in Japan. Although <b>this</b> <b>saw</b> {{does not share}} an ancestry with the other backsaws in this group, the concept is the same. Like most Japanese saws, the dōzuki cuts on the pull stroke, allowing for much straighter and narrower cuts than those achieved with push-stroke <b>saws.</b> <b>This</b> is due to tension on the blade during the cut (versus compression for a western saw), so less thickness is required to keep the saw blade straight.|$|R
40|$|Plank shoot – back is an {{undesirable}} {{phenomenon that}} occurs in the sawing of planks with table <b>saws.</b> <b>This</b> paper shows {{the results of an}} study of the phenomenon to establish its causes, frequency of occurrence, and its consequences. A theoretical energy analysis of the phenomenon was used to explain the results obtained from interviews with table – saw operators. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Interdigital {{transducers}} (IDTs) {{have found}} numerous applications in electronic devices for excitation and detection of {{surface acoustic waves}} (<b>SAWs).</b> <b>This</b> paper discusses the methods of solution of the electrostatic problem arising in modelling of the IDT most important characteristic — its frequency re-sponse. Numerical results are presented based on the so-called spectral approach. Computation difficulties are discussed and their solutions are proposed. 1...|$|R
5|$|Marriage was {{considered}} a civil ceremony, rather than a religious one. Such an arrangement {{may have been a}} habit that had developed during the Leiden years, as civil marriage was common in the Netherlands. However, the Pilgrims <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> arrangement as biblical, there being no evidence from Scripture that a minister should preside over a wedding.|$|E
5|$|On November 19, the British {{flotilla}} was captured, but Carleton narrowly escaped {{and made}} his way to Quebec City. Montgomery's kind treatment toward the captured British prisoners caused several officers to express their concern. Montgomery <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> as a challenge to his authority and this, along with the lack of discipline in the army, caused Montgomery to threaten resignation. Letters from Washington in which Washington also expressed his troubles with the discipline of troops convinced Montgomery to continue his command.|$|E
5|$|Roman Polanski's 1971 {{film version}} of Macbeth {{contained}} many parallels to his personal life in its graphic and violent depictions. His wife Sharon Tate had been murdered two years earlier by Charles Manson and three women. Many critics <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> as a clear parallel to Macbeth's murders {{at the urging of}} the Three Witches within the film.|$|E

5|$|Sabina {{ran out of}} {{the house}} with a hammer, {{periodically}} hitting herself over the head with it. A passing motorist, Joshua Grattage, <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> extraordinary behaviour and decided to tackle her in an attempt {{to take control of the}} hammer. While wrestling with Grattage, Sabina took a roof tile out of her pocket and struck him on the back of the head with it, stunning him temporarily.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the reign}} of Septimius Severus, sun worship had {{increased}} throughout the Empire. Elagabalus <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> {{as an opportunity to}} install Elagabal as the chief deity of the Roman pantheon. The god was renamed Deus Sol Invictus, meaning God the Undefeated Sun, and honored above Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|That day we saw horror, but we {{also saw}} quiet acts of courage. We <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> courage in a teacher named Liviu Librescu. With the gunman set to enter his class, this brave {{professor}} blocked the door with his body while his students fled to safety. On the Day of Remembrance, this Holocaust survivor gave his own life so that others may live. And this morning we honor his memory and we take strength from his example.|$|E

60|$|The {{stranger}} <b>saw</b> all <b>this</b> {{with eyes}} as keen as Ridgeley's. A cheerless and strange smile came upon his face.|$|R
5|$|The Kentish royal legend, {{probably}} 11th-century, {{contains the}} story of a villainous reeve of Ecgberht of Kent called Thunor, who is swallowed up by the earth at a place from then on known as þunores hlæwe (Old English 'Thunor's mound'). Gabriel Turville-Petre <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> as an invented origin for the placename demonstrating loss of memory that Thunor had been a god's name.|$|E
5|$|To appease {{those who}} {{considered}} her sex {{to be the}} most serious obstacle, Maria Theresa assumed masculine titles. Thus, in nomenclature, Maria Theresa was archduke and king; normally, however, she was styled as queen. No 18th-century commentary <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> crossing of gendered titles as inappropriate or impossible.|$|E
5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E

50|$|In the 1990s, in {{accordance}} with the START I treaty, the center was tasked with eliminating 365 B-52 bombers. The progress of this task was to be verified by Russia via satellite and first-person inspection at the facility. Initially, the B-52s were chopped into pieces with a 13,000-pound guillotine winched by a steel cable, supported by a crane. Later on, the tool of choice became K-12 rescue <b>saws.</b> <b>This</b> more precise technique afforded AMARG with salvageable spare parts.|$|R
