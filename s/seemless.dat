Considered by Billboard to be [...] "the biggest album {{in the history}} of Century Media Records", it was {{acclaimed}} by music critics and magazines. Corresponding with the release of the new album, Lacuna Coil toured with Rob Zombie throughout North America in early 2006. After their tour with Zombie, they performed main stage at Ozzfest 2006 along with System of a Down, Ozzy Osbourne, and Hatebreed, becoming the first female-fronted band to co-headline the heavy-metal festival. That summer they also played on the main stage of the Download Festival (a three-day music festival in England's Donington Park), which was headlined by Metallica, Tool, and Guns N' Roses. That December, Lacuna Coil teamed up with In Flames, The Sword and <b>Seemless</b> for a US tour, as well as The Blackest of the Black 2006 Tour.|$|E
40|$|The video {{performance}} {{benefits of}} burst-by-burst adaptive modulation are studied, employing a {{higher order modulation}} mode, when the channel is favourable, {{in order to increase}} the system's bits per symbol throughput and conversely, invoking a more robust, lower order modulation mode, when the channel exhibits inferior channel quality.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{an approach}} to the design and implementation of linear logic based agent systems via the linear logic semantics of Constraint Handling Rules (CHR). The intuition behind our approach is simple: Linear logic provides strong logical foundations to reason, verify and specify agent systems beyond the limitations of classical logics, while with CHR, one can implement and analyse agent systems in a concise and compact manner by executable inference rules. We discuss necessary refinements of the CHR semantics to allow for sequential computations of actions and the verification of action determinism. Our approach can possibly provide a <b>seemless</b> integration of the formal specification and implementation of agent programs via CHRs. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{analysis}} {{provided in}} this paper provides depth and demonstrates the evolution of IP-enabled technology and the constantly emerging challenges. This evolution leads to the distinct feature of having {{a wide spectrum of}} options for connectivity. Although WSNs equipped with IPs has long researched, the constantly evolving properties of innovative applications in IoT is constantly pressing for new findings to accommodate the new mechanism. Striking a balance between accommodating the growing complexity, sophistication and the constrained properties of the physical dimensions of the network is a constant challenge. The power of IoT resides in the ability to cater and make the demands of mobility <b>seemless.</b> The orientation between fostering responsibilities to the network from the host will constantly provide an evolving provision of ideal solutions.|$|E
30|$|RLC Acknowledged Mode (AM), {{which is}} a Selective Repeat Automatic Repeat Request protocol, is used between the UE and SRNC [22]. RLC AM does not include {{congestion}} control functionality, because it assumes that RLC PDUs are transmitted by MAC-d layer according to the available capacity. RLC AM was originally included in order to retransmit lost Uu data frames in case of traditional DCH, where frame loss over the air is {{in the order of}} 1 – 10 %. For E-DCH the frame loss on the air interface is significantly reduced by the HARQ retransmissions, but RLC AM was kept to allow <b>seemless</b> channel swithing between traditional DCH and E-DCH. The place of RLC AM and HARQ is depicted in Figure 2.|$|E
40|$|Networks of {{workstations}} are now viable {{environments for}} running distributed and parallel applications. Recent advances in software interconnection technology enables programmers to prepare applications {{to run in}} dynamically changing environments because module interconnection activity is regarded as an essentially distinct and different intellectual activity so as isolated from that of implementing individual modules. But there remains {{the question of how}} to optimize the performance of those applications for a given execution environment: how can developers realize performance gains without paying a high programming cost to specialize their application for the target environment? Interconnection technology has allowed programmers to tailor and tune their applications on distributed environments, but the traditional approach to this process has ignored the performance issue over gracefully <b>seemless</b> integration of various software components...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we are {{considering}} the web-based services related to product brands, so-called Brand Services, more closely, and propose {{a framework for}} the provision of such services. The framework is suited to the particular needs of such services, in particular for supporting brand protection against forgeries, as well as the sustainability of market competition by covering product quantity and quality related information. Main idea is the separation between an application service, and a brand service guarding service. With the addition of storing information in a logo or scheme by Gestalt based information hiding, entailment and control over the distributed information can be achieved.

40|$|It is {{extremely}} important that a university participates in community improvement. However, among the many published reports, the great majority come from architectural/design universities. Therefore, we examined the possibility of universities specializing in the life science participating more in this research in the future. The {{aim of this study}} was, through a questionnaire distributed among Fuji University students regarding community improvement, to obtain research material on future methods for implementing community improvement in universities specializing in life science through the investigation of community improvement activities implemented to date. First, we found that students have the desire and ability to undertake a variety of activities based on their areas of expertise. Second, the university requires a system by which engagement in community improvement programs is made easy. Third, it is necessary to make a <b>seemless</b> system of cooperation with the administration toward community improvement...|$|E
40|$|Prehension is {{proposed}} {{to consist of}} two movements mediated by separate neural pathways – a Reach transports the hand to the target while a Grasp shapes the hand for target purchase – but under vision the two movements appear as a <b>seemless</b> act. The {{purpose of the present}} thesis was to examine prehension under conditions of limited visual feedback. Removing vision in adults caused prehension to decompose into an open handed Reach followed by a haptically mediated Grasp, suggesting that haptics also access the Reach and Grasp pathways. That Grasp, but not Reach, formation is equally accurate under haptic versus visual control indicates that the sensory control of the two movements can be differentiated. Finally, young infants perform haptic Reach and Grasp movements before integrating them together under vision. These results suggest that the Reach and the Grasp, with their requisite neural pathways, originate under haptic control with secondary access by vision. AIHS, NSER...|$|E
40|$|This brief {{announcement}} {{focuses on}} interoperability of software transactions with ad hoc nonblocking algorithms. Specifically, we modify arbitrary nonblocking operations so that (1) {{they can be}} used both inside and outside transactions, (2) external uses serialize with transactions, and (3) internal uses succeed if and only if the surrounding transaction commits. Interoperability enables <b>seemless</b> integration with legacy code, atomic composition of nonblocking operations, and the equivalent of hand-optimized, closed nested transactions. The key to transaction safety is to ensure that memory accesses of operations called from inside a transaction occur (or appear to occur) if, only if, and when the surrounding transaction commits. We do this by making writes manifestly speculative, with their fate tied to that of the transaction, and by logging reads for re-validation immediately before the transaction commits. (Because correct nonblocking code is designed to tolerate races, additional, intermediate validation is not required.) When called from outside a transaction, operations behave {{as they did in the}} original nonblocking code, except that they aggressively abor...|$|E
40|$|Science and {{technology}} depend on true statements. Most {{of these are}} obtained via reasoning from experimental data using mathematics (models). Therefore the notion of proof that warrants correctness plays a highly important role. Even if a statement is proved, {{it may not be}} true; simply because a proof can be incorrect. Therefore a reliable technique of proof-checking has been proposed. For this method one needs fully formalised proofs. Since provability is undecidable, proofs in general cannot be generated automatically by machines. They have to be developed in an interactive fashion between a human and a machine. First a short description of the methodology of the development and verification of proofs is given. Then a class of formal systems is introduced that is particularly useful for this goal: various systems of dependent type theory. One of the reasons for this is that in type theory there is a <b>seemless</b> collaboration between computations and statements. Other reasons a [...] ...|$|E
