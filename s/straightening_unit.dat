40|$|ESAB is a {{world leader}} in {{production}} of welding consumables and equipment. The company manufactures, among other things, welding electrodes. A roller <b>straightening</b> <b>unit</b> {{is used in the}} cutting process to straighten the wire, which the welding electrode consists of, by adjusting some of the rollers during operation. According to ESAB’s standard and the European machinery directives, moving parts of machinery, such as rollers of the roller <b>straightening</b> <b>unit,</b> must be out of the operator’s reach. Guards and protective devices should achieve their safety function with minimal downtime and the least reduction in productivity. The main purpose with this project is to draw up protection device proposals for roller straightening units and based on drawings implement one suitable concept...|$|E
40|$|Regarding <b>straightening</b> <b>unit</b> as the {{research}} object, considered the different of roller spacing, {{a mathematical model}} of intermesh schedule suitable to the 2800 seven-roller strong heavy plate straightening machine was deduced by the geometric method. According to the mathematical model, the intermesh schedules of several specifications of plate were calculated, and the finite element model of straightening process {{was established in the}} finite element analysis software Abaqus. By analysing, it was found that those plates after straightening cannot meet the requirement of flatness, due to the existence of the work hardening. The bending deflection of the last <b>straightening</b> <b>unit</b> was modified and the new calculation formula of intermesh schedule was obtained. The values of the modified coefficients were determined by the finite element method. The intermesh schedules of other specifications of plate were calculated by the modified calculation formula and then verified it in Abaqus. The simulation results showed that those plates after straightening meet the requirement of flatness. So, {{the research}} results provide a theoretical basis for development of a new plate straightening machine and formulation of intermesh schedule...|$|E

Use of the block to decrease of internal tension in production of cold-shaped fittings allows to increase significantly its plastic properties, i. e. a power factor. At the same time combination of such device with the <b>straightening</b> <b>unit</b> similar to one used in production of thin wire and also minimization of specific reduction opens prospects for obtaining all necessary parameters of the fittings of a class «B» produced by cold rolling.  </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the process}} of the heavy rail roller straightening, the roller {{leveller}} only presses the plastic deformation on the web of heavy rail. Because the stiffness of flanges which are in both sides is stronger than the web, the heavy rail always has the phenomenon of web falling. In that case, we can not achieve the desired effect of straightening by the theoretic bending deflection. In this paper, a finite element model of one <b>straightening</b> <b>unit</b> was built by the ANSYS, the straightening process was simulated and the web falling affect with the bending deflection and the roller spacing was analyzed. Some pictures of curve were drew through the relationships of bending deflection and web falling, the relationships of roller spacing and web falling. In order to gain the better straightening effect, the actual bending deflection can be the sum of the theoretical bending deflection and web falling from the curve once the roller spacing was defined...|$|E
