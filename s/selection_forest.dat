40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} impact of two <b>selection</b> <b>forest</b> types with {{different}} tree species composition and their static stability against the windstorm that has affected the forest stands of High Tatra National Park in 2004 and uprooted more than 12 000 ha of the forest. The research objects were compartment 707 in protective district Vyšné Hágy and compartment 12041 in protective district Kežmarské žľaby. Studied stands had different tree species composition. In compartment 707, Norway spruce was the dominant tree species with the admixture of Silver fir and Scots pine. In compartment 12041, the Silver fir ratio reached 25 % and Norway spruce as the main tree species accounted for 65 %. In 1986 permanent research plots (PRP) of 0. 25 ha were established in both compartments. This article reports the structure of both selection forests before the calamity (year 1996) and after it (year 2009). Despite the high values of the static stability indicator, which were in the stands nearly equal, the trees of the upper and middle layer were uprooted or broken. In both stands, the lower layer of <b>selection</b> <b>forest</b> was preserved. In compartment 12041, where the fir ratio in tree species composition of the <b>selection</b> <b>forest</b> was 25 %, the current amount of fir in the next tree generation increased up to 41 % after the windstorm. The regeneration processes in the <b>selection</b> <b>forest</b> structure were sufficient and created conditions for securing the following stand generation. The research results in both investigated stands showed, that the silvicultural interventions in the forests of High Tatra NP should form a selection or mosaic structure in the stands respectively. Their natural tree species composition creates good conditions {{for the application of}} close-to-nature management and the maintaining of the next forest generation without additional silvicultural interventions...|$|E
40|$|The {{wind gust}} {{velocity}} of the windstorm that has affected High Tatra in 2004 reached almost 200 km. h− 1. This wind has uprooted more than 12 000 ha of the forest. In NP High Tatra the Department of Silviculture at the Forestry Faculty of TU Zvolen had established and observed a set of the permanent research plots (PRP), that were formed by {{the application of the}} selection cut during the long term period. The evaluation of the <b>selection</b> <b>forest</b> structure in the protection area Štrbské pleso is the object of this paper. In 1977 the permanent research plot of 0. 5 ha with the transect of 10 × 70 m was established in the investigated stand. The measurements were conducted in years 1977, 1998 and 2008. All dendrometric characteristics of each tree i. e. tree height, crown base height, dbh and tree crown radius by using 4 vectors along with the position of each tree were measured on the transect. On the rest of the research plot only dbh of the trees was recorded. Besides this the regeneration processes on the transect were quantified and the individuals were classified into particular categories. The changes of the <b>selection</b> <b>forest</b> structure after the windstorm, the crown ratio of the trees of the <b>selection</b> <b>forest</b> as the stability indicator (Tab. 4) and regeneration processes are analyzed in this paper. The trees uprooted due to the windstorm were distributed almost evenly over all diameter classes up to 54 cm. The results of the research have confirmed, that the high crown ratio over 66 % does not affect the maintenance of the tree or his uprooting, respectively, during such a wind velocity as was recorded in the High Tatra. It can be said, that the single tree <b>selection</b> <b>forest</b> has showed relatively high stability during the windstorm. This fact can be demonstrated also by the stand remnant, which can be considered sufficient for fulfilling the protection function of this stand for the future. The spruce regeneration processes are good after the windstorm and create a precondition for the next generation. No doubt, that this stand is able to fulfil the prescribed functions and at the moment no significant intervention of the forest manager is needed...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a wealth}} of smaller-scale studies {{on the effects of}} forest {{management}} on plant diversity. However, studies comparing plant species diversity in forests with different management types and intensity, extending over different regions and forest stages, and including detailed information on site conditions are missing. We studied vascular plants on 1500 20 m × 20 m forest plots in three regions of Germany (Schwäbische Alb, Hainich-Dün, Schorfheide-Chorin). In all regions, our study plots comprised different management types (unmanaged, selection cutting, deciduous and coniferous age-class forests, which resulted from clear cutting or shelterwood logging), various stand ages, site conditions, and levels of management-related disturbances. We analyzed how overall richness and richness of different plant functional groups (trees, shrubs, herbs, herbaceous species typically growing in forests and herbaceous light-demanding species) responded to the different management types. On average, plant species richness was 13 % higher in age-class than in unmanaged forests, and did not differ between deciduous age-class and <b>selection</b> <b>forests.</b> In age-class forests of the Schwäbische Alb and Hainich-Dün, coniferous stands had higher species richness than deciduous stands. Among age-class forests, older stands with large quantities of standing biomass were slightly poorer in shrub and light-demanding herb species than younger stands. Among deciduous forests, the richness of herbaceous forest species was generally lower in unmanaged than in managed forests, and it was even 20 % lower in unmanaged than in <b>selection</b> <b>forests</b> in Hainich-Dün. Overall, these findings show that disturbances by management generally increase plant species richness.

However generally (regardless of tree layer) {{the impact of}} tree species is not significant. The results have revealed the tree layer has no significant influence on the stem diameter increment as well.

40|$|The growth {{characteristics}} of silver fir are of high importance for <b>selection</b> <b>forest</b> management, {{and for the}} current aims laid out in Serbia’s forest management focused on increasing the share of silver firs in Serbia’s growing stock. With the objective of increasing {{the understanding of the}} growth {{characteristics of}} silver fir, the growth of two silver fir trees felled during forest site production research on Mt. Goč, located in Central Serbia, have been analyzed. Both trees showed significant differences in their growth dynamics over long periods as results of micro-site and micro-stand effects (primarily ambient light regime). The common growth characteristic of the two trees, a 450 -year-old tree as the main study object (labeled Tree A) and a 270 -year-old Tree B is a long stagnation stage. For Tree A the latent phase, with small interruptions, lasted 410 years; one phase lasted 330 years in continuity, which is the longest period of silver fir stagnation recorded in Europe. Tree B showed a long-lasting stagnation stage that lasted 170 years. The long stagnation stage of Tree A, characterized by an average diameter increment of 1. 4 mm/year (average growth ring width of 0. 7 mm) and an average height increment of 0. 08 m/year, shows the extraordinary silver fir capacity for physiological survival in complete shade. This study adds to the existing knowledge of the shade tolerance of the silver fir. Therefore, the silver fir belongs to the group of extremely shade-tolerant tree species. This characteristic makes silver fir an irreplaceable tree species in the <b>selection</b> <b>forest</b> structure. It offers a wide range of silvicultural flexibility in the management of these forests, and is applicable to silver fir selection Serbia’s forests. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

40|$|Abstract- The control method, one of {{the most}} {{reliable}} methods of <b>selection</b> <b>forest</b> management, has been applied in selection forests of western Serbia in a somewhat modified form (Goč variety) for fifty years. This paper analyzes the effects of the control method, i. e. its Goč variety, in the period from 1960 / 70 – 2000. It is based on the data of five successive complete inventories of the Forest Management Unit (FMU) “Tara”, whose high <b>selection</b> <b>forest</b> of spruce, fir and beech (Piceo-Abieti-Fagetum subass. typicum) trees on diluvium, brown and illimerised soil on limestone, and on limestone in formation with hornfels, are the best quality and the most spacious forests in the Management Class MC 491 / 1. The effects were monitored through the changes in the distribution of the number of trees and volume per diameter classes, separately for fir as the protagonist of the selection structure, and collectively at the level of a compartment, a typical representative of MC 491 / 1. Also, the analysis included the changes in the number of trees, volume, current volume increment, yield, and number of recruited trees per unit area (1 ha) by tree species in MC 491 / 1, occupying an area of 2, 648. 78 ha. The study results show that in the study period the average volume in MC 491 / 1 increased by 18. 8 %, the percentage of conifers increased from 66. 0 % to 78. 5 %, and the bearer of the changes was fir. The volume of the mean fir tree increased by 35. 9 % and it attained 1. 086 m 3. The volume increment increased by 15. 7 %. The selection structure of conifers was satisfactory, but there were problems with beech regeneration, in its stable presence and in its achievement of the targeted structure.

40|$|For this study, 18 {{permanent}} research plots in Switzerland with an {{area between}} 0. 5 and 2. 5 ha {{that have been}} installed between 1905 and 1931 were analysed using annuities. The plots cover {{a wide range of}} uneven-aged forest-types from pure Norway spruce to classical single-tree <b>selection</b> (plenter) <b>forests</b> dominated by Silver fir in different elevations (575 - 1810 m a. s. l). The areas have been managed according to an uneven-aged silvicultural system and growth and yield characteristics have been assessed on a single-tree basis every 5 - 11 years. Net revenues of timber harvesting were computed as a time series from the installation of the plots until today and transformed into net present values and subsequently into annuities for each assessment interval. Three types of annuities: (1) for cutting cycles; (2) forward; (3) backward for the whole assessment period were calculated together with internal rates of return. The results display that annuities were usually positive with an interest of 2 per cent. High elevation (> 1400 m) Norway spruce dominated forests as well as heavily overstocked (> 900 - 1000 m 3 ha− 1) plots showed the lowest or even negative annuities. The reduction of overstocks lead in the mid-term to an increase, but resulted in a short-term decrease of the annuities. For many of the research plots, especially those in higher elevations, there is a trend towards an increase of the annuities over time.

30|$|The {{results of}} forest spatial {{analyses}} {{show that most}} tree species exhibit {{a high degree of}} spatial mingling; that the spatial distribution of small and large trees is clustered; and that horizontal and vertical forest structures are very irregular. Observed spatial tree mark associations seem to be highly linked with seed dissemination processes, the relative shade tolerance of some tree species, and specific preferences for particular soil types. On the other hand, repulsive interactions could be an indication of competition processes that impose minimum distances between marks of trees. Selective tree removal is a major cause of spatial structuring (Longuetaud et al. 2008). For this reason, balanced structure areas are defined as the minimum contiguous area that is required for sustainable management of a multi-sized <b>selection</b> <b>forest</b> (Wehenkel et al. 2011).

The whole research area was regenerated on average 31 %, of which 21 % was damaged. We found a higher density of designated and undesignated skid trails on larger regeneration areas. Damage to young forest and damage to remaining productive stands were compared. In this respect the whole rotation period was divided into three time intervals, {{the first of which}} designated a mixed pattern of young forest area and younger phases prior to commercial thinning, in which the last of the old mature trees are removed. The second phase is a mix of currently productive stands and some young forest, in which the first and second commercial thinnings begin, until the final stage, in which young forest becomes increasingly abundant and perspective. In the last period, damage to productive stands is high (around 70 %), since they have accumulated over a long time period.

This outcome may be due to short transition zones, small rock sizes, low rock source heights and low resolution of the digital elevation model. Modelling requires more initial input than formalised expert assessment but gives spatially explicit results that enable comparison of silvicultural alternatives, coordination of silviculture and forest operations, and delineation of protection forests. Modelling also supported prioritising of silvicultural measures, where the necessity of silvicultural measures increases with increasing rockfall susceptibility and decreasing long-term stability of stands...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{phenotypic}} {{variation of the}} Atlantic Forest passerine Xiphorhynchus fuscus (Aves: Dendrocolaptidae) with the broad aim of addressing whether the history and type of forest affected the evolution of endemic taxa. We also tested whether the different subspecies and genetic lineages of X. fuscus could be considered full species. We collected plumage and body size measurements and, in combination with genetic data, used multivariate tests to evaluate the working hypotheses. Our results, combined with previous biogeographic analyses, indicate that vicariant events have been important determinants {{in the evolution of}} phenotypic characters of X. fuscus, once genetic isolation was complete. Our analysis also suggests that forest heterogeneity and ecotones are important factors in the early evolution of Atlantic Forest taxa, perhaps via divergent <b>selection.</b> <b>Forest</b> instability during the Pleistocene was critical in the evolution of phenotypic traits. We confirm that the subspecies atlanticus should be considered a full species. Other lineages or populations are also phenotypically differentiated but we do not suggest considering them as full species. They share high levels of gene flow and are part of a continuous latitudinal cline of phenotypic variation. Our study suggests that not all the historic events in the Atlantic Forest that affected the evolution of genetic lineages also influenced the evolution of phenotypic characters in the same direction and intensity. Undoubtedly, natural selection {{played a major role in}} the evolution of Atlantic Forest organisms...|$|E
40|$|Description Variable <b>selection</b> {{from random}} <b>forests</b> using both {{backwards}} variable elimination (for {{the selection of}} small sets of non-redundant variables) and selection based on the importance spectrum (somewhat similar to scree plots; for the selection of large, potentially highly-correlated variables). Main applications in high-dimensional data (e. g., microarray data, and other genomics and proteomics applications). You can use rpvm instead of Rmpi if you want but I’ve only tested with Rmpi...|$|R
30|$|Large-scale remote sensing-based {{inventories}} of forest cover are usually {{carried out by}} a combination of unsupervised classification of satellite imagery and subsequent manual (visual on-screen) enhancements with the highest classification accuracy taken as ground truth (e.g. Hansen et al. 2013). Because visual on-screen operations are time expensive procedures, manual classification may, as a rule, be performed only for a sample of imagery segments at a first stage <b>selection,</b> while <b>forest</b> cover within each selected segment is estimated at a second stage from a sample of pixels selected within the segment. The forest cover data arising from unsupervised classification of the satellite imagery available over the whole survey area (wall-to-wall data) are likely to be good proxies of the manually classified cover data (sample data), {{so that they can be}} adopted as suitable auxiliary information (e.g. Sannier et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Species <b>selection</b> for <b>forest</b> {{restoration}} {{is often}} supported by expert knowledge on local distribution patterns of native tree species. This {{approach is not}} applicable to largely deforested regions unless enough data on pre-human tree species distribution is available. In such regions, ecological niche models may provide essential information to support species selection {{in the framework of}} forest restoration planning. In this study we used ecological niche models to predict habitat suitability for native tree species in "Tierra de Campos" region, an almost totally deforested area of the Duero Basin (Spain). Previously available models provide habitat suitability predictions for dominant native tree species, but including non-dominant tree species in the forest restoration planning may be desirable to promote biodiversity, specially in largely deforested areas were near seed sources are not expected. We used the Forest Map of Spain as species occurrence data source to maximize the number of modeled tree species. Penalized logistic regression was used to train models using climate and lithological predictors. Using model predictions a set of tools were developed to support species <b>selection</b> in <b>forest</b> restoration planning. Model predictions were used to build ordered lists of suitable species for each cell of the study area. The suitable species lists were summarized drawing maps that showed the two most suitable species for each cell. Additionally, potential distribution maps of the suitable species for the study area were drawn. For a scenario with two dominant species, the models predicted a mixed forest (Quercus ilex and a coniferous tree species) for almost one half of the study area. According to the models, 22 non-dominant native tree species are suitable for the study area, with up to six suitable species per cell. The model predictions pointed to Crataegus monogyna, Juniperus communis, J. oxycedrus and J. phoenicea as the most suitable non-dominant native tree species in the study area. Our results encourage further use of ecological niche models for forest restoration planning in largely deforested regions...|$|R
