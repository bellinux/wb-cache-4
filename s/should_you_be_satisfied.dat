How can anyone else be impressed with his painting if he himself <b>is</b> not <b>satisfied</b> with his own performance? Not only that the others will not be impressed with his efforts but he will also be ridiculed. Thus, the painter would fall prey to restlessness, anxiety, and uneasiness. Therefore, do such things that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>satisfied</b> with them and don’t let your conscience grow dead. This is the secret for becoming a source of guidance to others.|$|R
