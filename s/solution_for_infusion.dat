40|$|Purpose: In {{order to}} {{identify}} methods for preventing phlebitis caused by intravenous administration of vinorelbine (VNR), we established a procedure for estimating the severity of phlebitis in an animal model. Methods: Four different factors (administration rate, dilution, flushing, and infusion of fat emulsion) were evaluated for alleviation of phlebitis caused by VNR infusion. VNR was diluted with normal saline to prepare test solutions with concentrations of 0. 6 mg/mL or 0. 3 mg/mL for infusion into the auricular veins of rabbits. Two days after VNR infusion, the veins were subjected to histopathological examination. Results: VNR did not cause obvious loss of venous endothelial cells, the most sensitive and common feature of phlebitis, but VNR infusion led to inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, and epidermal degeneration. Tissue damage was significantly decreased by shortening the administration time and by diluting the VNR <b>solution</b> <b>for</b> <b>infusion</b> from 0. 6 mg/mL to 0. 3 mg/mL. However, there was no effect of flushing with normal saline after VNR infusion, while treatment with fat emulsion before and after VNR infusion only had a minimal effect.

Methods: A decision model depicting the preparation pathways for branded docetaxel and generic docetaxel was constructed using published evidence and pharmacist-derived resource utilisation estimates. The model was used to {{estimate the}} net resource implications and budget impact to hospital pharmacies in Spain of using generic docetaxel instead of branded docetaxel. Results: Reconstituting branded docetaxel into a <b>solution</b> <b>for</b> <b>infusion</b> was estimated to take a pharmacy technician a mean 25 minutes, whereas generic docetaxel is a ready made-up solution. Use of generic docetaxel instead of branded docetaxel in an average Spanish hospital pharmacy preparing 1, 400 docetaxel infusions annually would potentially release 560 pharmacy technician man-hours per annum for alternative use and afford an annual cost-saving of € 0. 4 million. This equates to 40, 480 pharmacy technician man-hours per annum for all hospital pharmacies across Spain preparing 97, 000 docetaxel infusions annually and a costsaving of € 28. 4 million.

It is known to exert several important physiological and pharmacological functions. Among them, the antioxidant properties seem to be of paramount importance as they may be implied in the potential beneficial effects that have been observed in the critical care and hepatological settings. The specific antioxidant functions of the protein are closely related to its structure. Indeed, they are due to its multiple ligand-binding capacities and free radical-trapping properties.

Mice were intraperitoneally administered each photodegradation product, then number of stretching reactions or writhing reactions as types of pain behaviors was counted. Only Diazo-IC clearly induced the pain reactions in mice in a concentration-dependent manner: the other products caused no pain reaction.

On day 7 he was diagnosed with classical PKU (genotype IVS 10 - 11 G>A/IVS 12 + 1 G>A) due to highly elevated phenylalanine (Phe) level in newborn screening (2800 micromol/L). His maximum plasma Phe level reached 3696 micromol/L. Phe intake was stopped for 4 days. During this time the boy received intravenous glucose and lipids as well as little amounts of Phe-free formula by a nasogastric tube. Due to a deficit of essential amino acids and insufficient growth, a parenteral nutrition rich in branched-chain amino-acids and relatively poor in Phe was added, in order to promote protein synthesis without overloading in Phe.

Carrageenan was later infused into 3 D porous scaffolds under vacuum pressure and freeze-drying process. Five carrageenan concentrations were prepared and its physicochemical properties such as pH and viscosity were carried out on each concentration to determine the best solutions to produce a new composite 3 D structure. The preliminary result shows that carrageenan concentrations of 2, 4, and 6 % (w/v) were considered the best <b>solutions</b> <b>for</b> the <b>infusion</b> process due to its stable rheology properties. The pH and viscosity profiles of three selected carrageenan solutions were exhibited in the range of 9. 00 – 9. 20 and 0. 047 – 1. 144 [*]Pa·s, respectively. Moreover, the incorporated carrageenan gel fraction was in the range of 4. 30 % to 14. 95 % (w/w) which was determined by gravimetric analysis and dye staining method (visual assessment). The well-infused carrageenan 3 D scaffold was further characterized based on its internal morphology and degradability study. The vertical cross-sections of the scaffolds revealed homogeneous accumulation of dried gelatinous carrageenan which was covered throughout its pores wall. The degradation rate (K) of the carrageenan infused 3 D scaffold was between 0. 01 ± 1. 66 (mg/day) and 0. 03 ± 3. 23 (mg/day). The higher the carrageenan concentration used, the faster the degradation rate occurring (p 2 weeks). In conclusion, the usage of carrageenan as a composite material exhibits its great potential to be used in tissue engineering application and 3 D cell culture model...|$|R

It also includes ensuring quality, effective and safe drugs. In this case, the role of pharmacies is reduced to providing the population with ready-made products of industrial production. The problem of improving the technology of infusion solutions assigned in stationary conditions, including combined drugs of individual manufacture is especially acute. The aim of this work was to study and analyze the options for the extemporaneous manufacture of combined drugs <b>for</b> <b>infusion</b> introduction in hospital pharmacies. Materials and methods. The methodological basis {{of the study was}} a systemic approach, which makes it possible to identify the key elements of two different options for the extemporaneous manufacture of combined drugs <b>for</b> <b>infusion</b> administration. The research uses methods of logical and functional analyses. Results and discussion. The analysis of scientific sources on the issues of manufacturing of combined <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions</b> <b>for</b> the needs of stationary patients showed that manufacturing is carried out according to the traditional scheme for the Russian Federation, i. e. in the conditions of the procedural room of the department. In pharmacies of medical organizations, two variants of small-scale extemporal manufacture of combined infusion solutions are permissible using pharmaceutical substances and using sterile drugs of industrial production. The presence of a number of critical points of the first variant shows the irrationality and limitations of the use of such a scheme for the manufacture of combined infusion solutions in the pharmacy of a medical organization. The second version of the extemporal manufacture of combined infusion solutions is characterized by the simplicity of the technological scheme, the absence of complex calculations, a number of preparatory operations, filtration and sterilization steps, a simplified version of quality control, and the lack of complex equipment. This allows the rapid and large-scale production of various combinations of drugs <b>for</b> <b>infusion.</b> Conclusion. Manufacturing intravenous admixtures from commercial medicines allows the rapid and large production of various combinations of drugs <b>for</b> <b>infusion</b> introduction, does not contradict the current legislation, which makes it possible to consider it as the main variant of manufacturing of combined infusion solutions in hospital pharmacies. </p...|$|R
