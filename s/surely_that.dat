2500|$|Two days later, Emperor Wenzong {{summoned the}} senior officials, {{including}} {{the heads of}} the various key agencies of the imperial government, to inquire them as to what they opined. [...] A number of advisory officials, including Cui Xuanliang (崔玄亮), Li Guyan, Wang Zhi (王質), Lu Jun (盧均), Shu Yuanbao (舒元褒), Jiang Xi (蔣係), Pei Xiu (裴休), and Wei Wen (韋溫), begged Emperor Wenzong to reopen the discussions with chancellors and move the entire investigations to the proper governmental authorities. [...] Emperor Wenzong told them that he had already discussed with the high level officials and ordered them to withdraw. [...] Cui bowed and wept, stating, [...] "One should be careful even when executing a commoner, and even more care should be paid when killing a chancellor." [...] Emperor Wenzong's anger somewhat subsided, and he summoned the chancellors again. [...] Niu then stated, [...] "The highest that a subject can reach is chancellor, and Song Shenxi is already a chancellor. [...] If the accusations were true, he could still only be chancellor, and why would he pursue that? [...] <b>Surely</b> <b>that</b> was not what he was planning." [...] Meanwhile, Zheng, fearing that the officials would win out and that a second round of investigations would show the truth, suggested to Wang Shoucheng that no executions be carried out, and instead Song should be exiled.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Simeon bar Abba in {{the name}} of Rabbi Johanan taught that every time Scripture uses the {{expression}} “and it was” (vayechi), it intimates the coming of either trouble or joy. [...] If it intimates trouble, there is no trouble to compare with it, and if it itimatres joy, there is no joy to compare with it. [...] Rabbi Samuel bar Nahman made a distinction: [...] In every instance where Scripture employs “and it was” (vayechi), it introduces trouble, while when Scripture employs “and it shall be” (vehayah), it introduces joy. [...] The Sages raised an objection to Rabbi Samuel’s view, noting that to introduce the offerings of the princes, [...] says, “And he that presented his offering [...] [...] [...] was (vayechi),” and <b>surely</b> <b>that</b> was a positive thing. [...] Rabbi Samuel replied that the occasion of the princes’ gifts did not indicate joy, because it was manifest to God that the princes would join with Korah in his dispute (as reported in [...] ). [...] Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi Simon said {{in the name}} of Rabbi Levi ben Parta that the case could be compared to that of a member of the palace who committed a theft in the bathhouse, and the attendant, while afraid of disclosing his name, nevertheless made him known by describing him as a certain young man dressed in white. [...] Similarly, although [...] does not explicitly mention the names of the princes who sided with Korah in his dispute, [...] nevertheless refers to them when it says, “They were princes of the congregation, the elect men of the assembly, men of renown,” and this recalls [...] “These were the elect of the congregation, the princes of the tribes of their fathers [...] [...] [...] ,” where the text lists their names. [...] They were the “men of renown” whose names were mentioned in connection with the standards; as [...] says, “These are the names of the men who shall stand with you, of Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur; of Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai [...] [...] [...] [...]” ...|$|E
