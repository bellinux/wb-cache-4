The Berezis merged shortly after with ETA(m), following that the resulting organization became the main branch of ETA and was called from then on ETA(m).

2500|$|Although {{his name}} and work might have been forgotten, Charles Bettelheim has left some tracks. His heterodox Marxist {{thinking}} has helped bring into doubt the [...] "Progressivism" [...] and [...] "Productivism" [...] of classic leftism, giving rise to [...] "alternative" [...] thinking, which not only {{gave birth to the}} idea of [...] "social emancipation from industrial growth" [...] as an end in itself, but aspired to put productive development into the context of social consciousness (basically, it was no more than the idea originated by Karl Marx: to end the <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> social <b>action</b> to the process of production, in favor <b>of</b> conscious <b>submission</b> to production for social needs). Thus, Bettelheim was an intermediary between [...] "red" [...] thinking and [...] "green", between socialism and ecology.

40|$|Local governments play {{a crucial}} role in {{mitigating}} the effects of climate change, all the more so when considering that 80 % of energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions is associated with urban activity. The Covenant of Mayors (CoM) is the mainstream European movement involving local authorities, voluntarily committing to meet and exceed the European Union 20 % CO 2 reduction objective by 2020 by increasing energy efficiency and through the use of renewable energy sources on their territories. In order to achieve its CO 2 reduction objective, a city that signs the CoM commits to a number <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> such as: to prepare a Baseline Emission Inventory (BEI); to submit a Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP); to adapt city structures in order to undertake the necessary actions, and to mobilise the civil society in their respective geographical areas to take part in implementing the Action Plan. A regular Monitoring of Emission Inventories in which progress towards target is measured is also required. Finally signatories of CoM have to submit an action report at least every second year after <b>submission</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Action</b> Plan. So far, over 5000 cities have signed up to participate in the CoM and over 3000 cities have submitted their SEAPs. 1850 SEAP have been analysed and approved. The paper presents the evaluation of the CoM intiative after 5 years, including the expansion of the scheme to ex-CIS countries and North Africa. JRC. F. 7 -Renewables and Energy Efficienc...|$|R

At the national level, direct democracy has never been used for either type of enactment. At the state and local level, however, its use dates back to colonial times and has been increasing gradually (though still not universal) ever since.
