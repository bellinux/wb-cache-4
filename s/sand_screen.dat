The corrosion rate and the slot width increment increase with the increasing of the ClG concentrations. However, the corrosion rate and slot width increment decrease with the increasing of the Ca 2 + concentrations. The complexity of the HCO 3 - hydration results in the corrosion complexity.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the theories of}} piston effect and ballooning {{and how they can}} impact on the success of a completions integrity test. Piston effect caused by pressure changes induced during integrity tests in a tubing string stabbed into a packer bore can cause a reduction in the length of the tubing string. Internal pressure applied to the tubing string in the course of an integrity test can balloon the tubing string also causing a reduction in effective length. The results from this study have clearly shown that the combined effect of piston and ballooning can unseat the tubing seals from the packer bore leading to an unsuccessful integrity test. This was the case here and the (NPT) non productive time cost of this failure was over 450, 000 dollars.

Sand screens are not a perfect completion, they can be damaged by a collapsed borehole, plugged by reservoir fines or be eroded by sand. The idea behind this thesis is to investigate the effects of rate constraints on reservoir performance due to erosion of sand screens in a cased hole. This is done by incorporating an analytical <b>sand</b> <b>screen</b> erosion model with a completion model in NETool and a reservoir model in ECLIPSE.

Two molded and welded emitters showed the worst performance: one non-pressure-compensated with the lowest passage section, and the other pressure-compensated that, after 800  h working at higher dripline flow and particle load, experienced an important decrease in flow rate. Only with the effluent that had a higher number of particles, did the filter and the interaction of filter and emitter location have a significant effect.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this master thesis is borehole stability in the Åre Formation of the Heidrun reservoir, in connection with open hole <b>sand</b> <b>screen</b> completions. Due to operational limitations this type of completion will be more sensitive for borehole stability problems, and each failure or misrun will {{cost a lot of}} money in lost equipment, downtime, side tracking and delayed production. To find a best practice for drilling and completing these wells will therefore be of key importance for the further field development. The purpose of this Master Thesis was to perform literary studies on coal, borehole stability of fractured formations and previous coal experience, and tie this back to the experienced problems with running screens in the Åre reservoir. Some of the main results are shown below: o Coal is a combustible, organic rock with large heterogeneities and anisotropydue to a very characteristic cleat system. With confining strengths Heidrun coal are quite strong with a UCS of 37 MPa from rock mechanical laboratory testing performed by SINTEF. However, due to the cleat system coal appearsas an easily friable rock, which can cause significant problem downhole whenrunning equipment like open hole screen completions, as is the case on Heidrun. o The presence of coal in the Heidrun reservoir has been investigated, as has the coal appearance in Åre problem wells. The coalbed thickness is mostly quite small, about 0, 5 mTVD, and this would most likely not cause a problem inlow to medium angle wells. Almost horizontal wells on the other hand canhave severe differences with this thickness, well illustrated by well A- 24 T 2. o Due to the unpredictable nature of the coal abundance and cleat orientation some uncertainties can not be eliminated in the planning phase. o Even though there are at least 4 of the problem wells that seemingly has nocoal in them, the general assumption from CPI logs is that coal is the mainproblem geology regarding hole enlargements and possible ledge problematic. o Due to the cleat system, coal can be particularly sensitive to pressure transients, caused by surge/swab and ECD variations. This also applies to other geologies, but to a much smaller degree. The solution can prove to be implementing a good mud system that can prevent pressure equalization through the cleat system of coal. Also LEDO drilling and “finesse” during drilling operations are recommended. o The increase in failure wells in the recent years can possibly explained by an increase in ECD and other pressure transients. In addition, depletion in thereservoir can in case of a permeable borehole wall and high angles have a negative effect on stability. </p...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThis thesis aims to give {{a general}} insight into sand control and various sorts of sand control {{measures}} and applications of sand control tools. Special focus {{will be given to}} expandable sand screens – a technology which came about in the late 1990 ’s through the use of flexible, expandable tubulars as base pipe in sand screens. More specifically Darcy’s Hydraulic Endurance Screens, a compliant <b>sand</b> <b>screen</b> system using hydraulic activation, and the future use of these will be discussed. This technology has been successfully deployed in a test rig environment(System Integration Test) 14 and was planned to be field tested for Statoil on the Statfjord field(Well B- 03) 14, an operation which eventually was delayed as the 9 5 / 8 “ casing above the reservoir could not be cemented due to heavy losses. Insight will be given into possible future use of the Hydraulic Endurance screens - specifically in water injector wells. Sand control {{is one of the key}} aspects to be considered when planning the completion of a well. Sand control tools may not always be necessary in a well - at least not from the start – and whether or not these are to be installed is one of the first things that need to be decided on. However, in poorly consolidated or unconsolidated sandstone reservoirs sand production is one of the biggest challenges for the completion and production engineers and some sort of sand control tools will almost always have to be installed at some point during the wells lifecycle. These tools or sand control methods may include, but are not limited to, slotted or pre-drilled liners, gravel packs, frac packs, selective perforations, oriented perforations or as mentioned above, different types of sand screens. All of these sand control measures and their use will be discussed. In water injectors, sand production poses certain specific challenges. These challenges usually arise not during the actual water injection, but when for various reasons the injection has to be stopped and the well is shut-in. These “water injector”-specific challenges include reservoir cross-flow between formation layers of different permeability, the “water hammer” phenomenon, well-to-well backflow, thermal fractures and gravel loss into fracture systems. If one or more of these factors come into play, sand production may be initiated and a situation where the injection well is filled with sand may be the case. It is the aim of this thesis to discuss and analyze whether or not the Darcy’s Hydraulic Endurance Screens may solve or improve on these challenges in water injectors and how they compare to the Open Hole Gravel Pack and the Stand Alone Screen, specifically with a possible use at the Johan Sverdrup field in mind. A theoretical case of a field installation of Darcy’s Hydraulic Endurance Screens in a water injector well at the Johan Sverdrup field will be presented. It was found that Darcy’s Hydraulic Endurance Screen is a fully viable alternative to Open Hole Gravel Packs and Stand Alone Screens in water injector wells. It is particularly well suited for the Johan Sverdrup field as the innovative utilization of a solid base pipe together with a compliant screen design enables among other things injection selectivity with the possibility of future shut-off, integration of Inflow Control Devices and easier filter cake removal - factors that may be vital in the two-zone reservoir encountered at the Johan Sverdrup field. Uncertainties with the Hydraulic Endurance screens mostly relate to the lack of experience running the system...|$|E
40|$|Borehole sonic {{measurements}} {{are an important}} tool to characterize formation and completion properties of hydrocarbon or water reservoirs. Such measurements can provide direct information about rock physical parameters such as permeability or elastic moduli. These properties are obtained from guided waves propagating along boreholes. The so called tube wave or Stoneley wave is a symmetric mode which compresses the fluid column leading to a piston like motion. If the medium around the borehole wall is permeable, the radial expansion of the fluid column will result in fluid flow across the borehole wall. This results in a sensitivity of the tube wave signature to the permeability of the surrounding formation which manifests itself in a characteristic dispersion and attenuation of the tube wave. Information about the permeability of the surrounding formation provides essential knowledge for reservoir characterization. In addition to the traditional method of using tube wave signatures for formation permeability estimations, the same approach {{may be used for}} production monitoring. In sand reservoirs a complicated borehole completion is installed during the production phase for the purpose of controlling sand production. In such a setup highly permeable layers such as a <b>sand</b> <b>screen</b> or a gravel pack are used to prevent sand production. The problem with such completions is that they are very expensive to install and susceptible to plugging or corrosion. No permanent surveillance tool exists to date which allows diagnosis of problems in sand-screened deepwater completions. However, the recently proposed Real-Time Completion Monitoring (RTCM) uses the signature of tube waves to identify permeability changes: the increase of the tube wave velocity can indicate a decrease of permeability and vice versa. Therefore, RTCM has potential to identify problems in sand-screened deepwater completions. In order to understand the acoustic response of such deepwater completions, the dispersion and attenuation of tube waves in this complicated setup needs to be studied. To this end I have developed a modelling algorithm based on a spectral method. The developed algorithm computes the dispersion and attenuation of borehole modes propagating in a cylindrically layered structure with an arbitrary number of fluid, elastic and poroelastic layers. The numerical algorithm discretizes the medium along the radial axis using Chebyshev interpolation points derived from Chebyshev polynomials. The differential operators are discretized using spectral differentiation matrices. Thus, for any number of layers, the corresponding equations can be expressed as a generalized algebraic eigenvalue problem. For a given frequency, the eigenvalues correspond to the wavenumbers of different modes. The eigenvectors, computed along with the eigenvalues, correspond to the displacement potentials. They can be used to obtain the variation of displacement and stress components along the radius of the structure. In this thesis the spectral method was first developed for structures with an arbitrary number of fluid and elastic layers. Subsequently, the algorithm was extended for poroelasticity. The results produced by the modelling program are benchmarked against analytical solutions. Such analytical solutions are known for elastic and poroelastic cylinders as well as fluid filled tubes. The tube wave dispersion in a fluid-filled borehole surrounded by an elastic or poroelastic formation obtained with the spectral method was compared to the analytical low-frequency solution. I obtained the dispersion of the two tube waves propagating in a four layer completion model: fluid – permeable sand-screen – fluid – elastic casing. Varying the permeability of the sand-screen layer allowed me to account for the effect of fluid flow across this layer. Being able to obtain the acoustic response can help to identify broken fluid communication which increases the tube wave velocity. A corroded sand-screen has an extremely attenuated tube wave signature. Furthermore, I have implemented the more complex model of a borehole surrounded by an altered zone in the algorithm. Due to drilling damage the altered zone is an area of reduced permeability. In order to account for the effect of the altered zone on the tube wave signature, up to ten layers were used with stepwise increase of permeability from the borehole towards the formation. Overall, the spectral method proved to be a valuable algorithm to model wave propagation in cylindrical structures. Using borehole modes to evaluate the physical properties of the formation or completions is an important application. However, in borehole seismic modelling, such as crosshole or VSP, {{it is also important to}} account for the effect of boreholes and the associated modes. Since the borehole radius is a thousand times smaller then the investigated volume it would require a prohibitively small grid size to explicitly model the borehole. However, it is possible to effectively represent a borehole as a superposition of point sources. This mimics the presence of borehole modes. In order to implement this technique for poroelasticity, it is necessary to model source signatures in poroelastic media. To this end I have analyzed the radiation characteristics and moment tensor solutions for various source types. Together with the spectral method these point source representations can be used to model the effect of boreholes. This will pave the way for more efficient poroelastic seismic modelling in various fluid-filled boreholes and completions...|$|E

Therefore, some from of sand control is employed of which the mechanical sand retention, i. e. gravel pack and <b>sand</b> control <b>screen</b> are the most popular. The use of sand control devices inevitably causes decline in well productivity, which is characterized by the additional pressure drop across the device(s).

Recent advances in laser cutting means that slotting can now be done much cheaper to much smaller slot widths and in some situation slotted liner is now used for the same functionality as <b>sand</b> control <b>screens.</b>|$|R
40|$|An Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) well {{is planned}} for the Ormen Lange field in order to tap {{isolated}} reserves and maintain production. However Low fracture gradient, poorly consolidated formation and high fines content all act to compromise the current sand control design. The {{aim of this study}} is to propose a recommendation for the sand-face completion type for the planned ERD well. To facilitate this, a number of new solutions and techniques were evaluated with a focus on well productivity, performance and the requirement for a 30 year+ well life. Specifically the scope of this study covers: Size of production liner and dimensions of <b>sand</b> <b>screens</b> based on torque and drag. Fluid testing performed to evaluate the rheological properties and filter-cake dissolution capability of the carrier fluid. Finally a production performance study was performed to recommend a final completion solution for the ERD-well based on production rates. After careful consideration the shunt-tube system was selected for use in the planned ERD well. This system was found to best overcome the challenge of low fracture gradient, unconsolidated formation and high fines content. It provides a tight and complete gravel pack which limits movement of unconsolidated sand and gives good retention quality. A new carrier fluid was successfully developed with the required rheological properties and dissolution qualities. Based on production performance and a successful torque and drag analysis was the 9 - 5 / 8 in-liner selected. </p...|$|R
50|$|From {{the machine}} chest stock is pumped {{to a head}} tank, {{commonly}} called a head box, whose purpose is to maintain a constant head (pressure) on the stock as it feeds the basis weight valve. The head box also provides a means allowing air bubbles to escape. The basis weight valve meters the stock to the recirculating stream of water that is pumped, by the fan pump, from a whitewater chest through to the flow box. On {{the way to the}} flow box the pulp slurry may pass through centrifugal cleaners, which remove heavy contaminants like <b>sand,</b> and <b>screens,</b> which break up fibre clumps and remove over-sized debris.|$|R
25|$|This is {{selected}} where the liner {{is required to}} mechanically hold back the movement of formation sand. There are many variants of openhole sand control, the three popular choices being stand-alone screens, openhole gravel packs (also known as external gravel packs, where a sized sand 'gravel' is placed as an annulus around the <b>sand</b> control <b>screen)</b> and expandable screens. Screen designs are mainly wire-wrap or premium; wire-wrap screens use spiral-welded corrosion-resistant wire wrapped around a drilled basepipe to provide a consistent small helical gap (such as , termed 12 gauge). Premium screens use a woven metal cloth wrapped around a basepipe. Expandable screens are run to depth before being mechanically swaged to a larger diameter. Ideally, expandable screens will be swaged until they contact the wellbore wall.|$|R
