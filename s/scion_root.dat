For the experiment, we selected six farmers who have outbreak of <b>scion</b> <b>root</b> in their Shiranuhi mandarin orchards and surveyed the difference of fruit quality of shiranuhi mandarin hybrid between <b>scion</b> <b>root</b> and control (trifoliate orange root).

Therefore, the Jjak Kkung rootstock caused aboveground growth reduction, water conservation and increased photosynthetic tolerance of mild drought. These data show that different rootstocks can change the photosynthetic responses to drought of a high yielding, commercial tomato line.

Detached leaflets, and control and steam-girdled intact plants, were left turgid or were wilted in air. Detached leaflets and the leaflets and roots of the intact plants were analyzed for their abscisic acid (ABA) content. Turgid RR leaflets contained about 2. 9 ng ABA per milligram dry weight. On average, the flc and sit leaflets contained 33 and 11 % of this amount, respectively. The lack of ABA approximately correlated with {{the severity of the}} mutant phenotype.

Chili pepper grafting for disease manage- ment is attracting {{increased interest in}} recent years. Using the tube grafting technique, different compatible scion/rootstock combinations were obtained with the wild-type pepper SCM 334 and the local chili pepper cultivars ‘Beldi’ and ‘Baker’. SCM 334 was resistant to P. nicotianae, while the cultivars Beldi and Baker were susceptible. Plant inoculations were performed with P. nicotianae zoospores, and severity of root rot was rated 30 days post- inoculation using a 0 (healthy plant) to 5 (dead plant) severity score. On SCM 334 rootstock and with ‘Beldi’ or ‘Baker’ scions, the intensity of root rot was very low (mean score 0. 1 – 0. 2) and plants were healthy. However, with Baker or Beldi rootstocks and SCM 334 <b>scions,</b> <b>root</b> rot was severe (mean score 3. 1 – 4. 6), leading to high numbers of wilting and dead plants. This severe root rot {{was similar to that}} observed on non-grafted plants of ‘Baker’ and ‘Beldi’ inoculated with the pathogen. Under greenhouse conditions, measurements of agronomic characters indicated non-consistent improvement of these features on the scion cultivar when SCM 334 was the rootstock.

40|$|Breeding {{plants that}} produce {{equivalent}} growth with reduced water input (improved water use efficiency (WUE)) {{is necessary for}} sustained future crop production. Water deficit induces redistribution and synthesis of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) thereby restricting transpiration. ABA is synthesised via cleavage of oxygenated carotenoids (xanthophylls). This work involved two approaches and three key ratelimiting enzymes in the ABA biosynthesis pathway: 9 -cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) β-carotene hydroxylase (BCH); and phytoene synthase (PSY). Increasing ABA production under optimal conditions by overexpressing SlNCED 1 {{has been shown to}} reduce stomatal conductance and improve WUE. The first approach, part of a larger programme exploring the allelic variation of NCED 1 in wild tomato species, describes the introgression of S. galapagense and S. neorickii NCED 1 alleles into the cultivated tomato background S. lycopersicum cv. Ailsa Craig. Plants homozygous for SgNCED 1, SnNCED 1 and SlNCED 1 alleles were compared for water use gravimetrically. It was concluded that SgNCED 1 and SnNCED 1 did not improve WUE. The second approach involved creating a transgenic rootstock that might provide sufficient extra root-sourced ABA under non-stressed conditions to improve WUE of a non-transgenic <b>scion.</b> <b>Root</b> tissues contain less carotenoids than photosynthetic tissues, which may limit increases in root ABA biosynthesis. To increase precursor flux through the pathway, transgenic lines simultaneously over-expressing SlPSY 1, SlBCH 2, and SlNCED 1 were created by crossing two double transgenic lines. Isolated roots of a selected triple line (H- 22 - 8 - 8) accumulated increased concentrations of carotenoids, ABA and ABA catabolites. Gravimetric water use trials revealed that WT/H- 22 - 8 - 8 (scion/rootstock) grafts frequently showed improved; TEp, δ 13 C, exudate flow rate and ABA concentration. H- 22 - 8 - 8 rootstock conferred a consistent, modest, daily water saving; significant in the absence of water stress.

In this study, the short-term effects of amendments were evaluated in a trial combining three substrates (biochar, compost, peat-based media) with three doses (30, 70, 100 %) along a time sequence on 1 -year-old bare root cuttings of grapevine. Amendments were analyzed for elemental composition. Soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), chlorophyll (CHL), flavonoids (FL), anthocyans (ANT) and nitrogen balance index (NBI) were measured. Biochar differed from other amendments for stable C structures, where nutrients and lignin residues were high in compost. Biochar increased soil pH, whereas biochar plus compost mixture augmented EC. The amended plants had detrimental effects on root, true and lateral leaves. Nevertheless, at the lowest rate biochar increased the primary shoot and total <b>scion</b> to <b>root</b> biomass ratio. Among biochemicals, ANT and NBI were mostly affected by biochar, while compost gave only slight increments.

40|$|Strigolactones are {{considered}} {{a new group of}} plant hormones. Their role as modulators of plant growth and signalling molecules for plant interactions first became evident in Arabidopsis, pea, and rice mutants that were flawed in strigolactone production, release, or perception. The first evidence in tomato (Solanum lycopersicon) of strigolactone deficiency is presented here. Sl-ORT 1, previously identified as resistant to the parasitic plant Orobanche, had lower levels of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (Glomus intraradices) colonization, possibly {{as a result of its}} reduced ability to induce mycorrhizal hyphal branching. Biochemical analysis of mutant root extracts suggested that it produces only minute amounts of two of the tomato strigolactones: solanacol and didehydro-orobanchol. Accordingly, the transcription level of a key enzyme (CCD 7) putatively involved in strigolactone synthesis in tomato was reduced in Sl-ORT 1 compared with the wild type (WT). Sl-ORT 1 shoots exhibited increased lateral shoot branching, whereas exogenous application of the synthetic strigolactone GR 24 to the mutant restored the WT phenotype by reducing the number of lateral branches. Reduced lateral shoot branching was also evident in grafted plants which included a WT interstock, which was grafted between the mutant rootstock and the <b>scion.</b> In <b>roots</b> of these grafted plants, the CCD 7 transcription level was not significantly induced, nor was mycorrhizal sensitivity restored. Hence, WT-interstock grafting, which restores mutant shoot morphology to WT, does not restore mutant root properties to WT.

Results from grafts between wild-type (WT) and rms 4 plants indicate that the concentration of cytokinins in the xylem sap of the roots is determined almost entirely by the genotype of the shoot.

This paper proposes a {{protocol}} of rejuvenation of four Sahelian ligneous species : Acacia senegal, Faidherbia albida, Tamarindus indica and Ziziphus mauritian. It consists in aseptically removing a small scion (5 - 10 mm in length) and in micrografting {{it on to}} a seeding grown in vitro used as rootstock. The main elements of success are {{the age of the}} rootstock (two to six weeks depending on species), the level of grafting (on hypocotyl instead of epicotyl) and the origin of the scion (apex have higher growth after micrografting than axillary buds). The method developed was applied to the restoration of juvenile traits of adult trees. The main criterion is the rooting ability of microcuttings sampled on <b>scions,</b> after micrografting. <b>Rooting</b> competence restoration depends on the species, the nature of the first copy of the donor tree and the number of cycles of micrografting. The rejuvenation was more definite for F. albida, mobilised by root cuttings. In this case, one third of the microcuttings rooted after the first cycle of micrografting and 75 % after the second.

The multiple functions of TCTP have been inferred from its involvement in several cell pathways, but the specific function of TCTP is still not known in detail. On the other hand, TCTP seems {{to respond to a}} plethora of external signals, and appears to be regulated at the transcriptional and/or translational levels by mechanisms yet to be determined. In the present work, we analyzed the capacity of AtTCTP 2 gene products (mRNA and protein) to translocate long distance through tobacco heterografts (Transgenic/WT and WT/Transgenic). The results indicate that both AtTCTP 2 mRNA and protein are capable of moving long distance in both directions (stock-scion and scion-stock) with a tendency for movement from source to sink tissue (stock to <b>scion).</b> Interestingly, aerial <b>roots</b> emerged only in heterografts where the protein was detected in both stock and scion, suggesting a correlation between the presence of AtTCTP 2 and appearance of aerial adventitious roots. More detailed analysis showed that these adventitious aerial roots harbored the transgene and expressed both transcript and protein. In addition, the protein localization pattern in transgenic aerial and primary roots was basically the same, indicating specific nuclear destination in roots, but also in leaves. These findings provide an approach to understand the role of long-distance movement in the function of plant TCTPs, supporting the notion that some of these act in a non-cell autonomous manner, as the human counterpart, the Histamine Releasing Factor (HRF) ...|$|R

Tissue samples collected on harvest dates and from cuttings undergoing root initiation, were analysed for endogenous, plant growth regulators. Promotion of root formation by a concentrated, quick-dip treatment of Indole-butyric acid (IBA) was only observed in shoots with a high natural ability to initiate roots, when planted as cuttings. Root initiation potential appeared to be directly related to endogenous levels of an indole-acetic acid (IAA) -like growth promoter. No positive correlation between root initiation and bud dormancy, endogenous Abscisic Acid, Cytokinin or Rooting Cofactor levels was established. Reciprocal donor-grafting experiments showed that a root promoting stimulus was graft transferable from MM 106 into EM XII and that a promoter chromatographically similar to IAA accumulated in EM XII stocks grafted with MM 106 <b>scions.</b> No active <b>rooting</b> inhibitors were located from the seasonal or donor-grafted tissue samples. A separation of the modes of action of IAA and IBA in promoting root formation was shown. IAA {{appeared to be the}} fundamental physiological promoter of adventitious root formation; the number of roots increasing with an increased concentration of IAA. IBA seemed to have a supporting role in promoting root formation, and could not further promote rooting if applied at increasing concentrations above a threshold level. IBA appeared to be active in the root initiation process by protecting the endogenous IAA levels in the cutting base. Studies of the metabolism of 14 C-IAA in the cuttings base indicated that IAA was protected from enzymic degradation and conjugation (both inactivation processes) by the application of IBA prior to planting. IBA was only active in promoting rooting if an optimum level of IAA was present.

The {{first part of this}} study investigates various rootstocks for their ability to influence production and quality throughout the year. The mutual influence between <b>scion</b> and <b>root</b> system during normal practical growing management in soil without artificial light was followed and its physiological background studied. In the second part attention was mainly focussed on shoot-root ratio, root carbohydrates and mortality and regeneration of roots. In Part I, in one long term experiment, the effect of 17 root systems on plant behaviour of the scion cultivar Rosa 'Varlon' grown in soil without supplementary lighting was studied for three years under conditions of relatively low greenhouse temperatures. It became clear that the root system influenced the building up of the rose bush, and that this particularly took place during the first year after planting. Considering only the plants propagated by stenting, the number of bottom-breaks for R. 'Varlon' plants varied between 1. 5 for R. 'Motrea' and 2. 3 per plant for R. indica 'Major'. About 90 % of all the bottom-breaks were formed in the initial months after planting. The quality of these bottom- breaks, e. g. the diameter at the time they were harvested, was 15 percent higher for the best rootstock, R. 'Mme Alfred Carrière', compared with the least, R. 'Paul's Lemmon Pillar'. The percentage of secondary thickening of bottom-breaks after three years varied somewhat per rootstock and was on average about 20 %. Eventually, the difference between rootstocks with respect to bottom-break diameter was about the same as obtained during their harvest. After three years it became apparent that plants on R. 'Moonlight' produced the highest number of branches per bottom-break, i. e. 2. 4, whereas the bottom-breaks of R. zigrii had only 1. 4 laterals. The diameter of these laterals varied from 10. 2 mm for plants on R. 'Fredica' to 8. 6 mm. for plants on R. 'Paul's Lemmon Pillar'. The number of shoots at 60 cm above ground level and exceeding 0. 5 cm, diameter, the socalled structural shoots, was 6. 6 per plant for R. 'Moonlight', which means that it exceeded the least R. zigrii by 60 %. This means that the same tendency was found here as was noticed for the number of branches per bottom-break. It became clear that competition existed between the number of structural shoots per plant; the more shoots produced, the more eventually died off. The diameter of the structural shoots reached a maximum when grown on R. 'Mine Alfred Carrière' and a minimum when grown on R. 'Paul's Lemmon Pillar'. This result is comparable with that found for the diameter of the bottom-breaks. The method of propagation proved to be an important factor with respect to the building up of the plant; the plants bench grafted on R. canina 'Inermis' produced the highest total number of bottom-breaks but their diameter, secondary thickening and weight remained behind all the other rootstocks including the root-grafted R. canina 'Inermis' plants. In the same R. 'Varlon' experiment differences of more than 100 % between rootstocks, irrespective of the method of propagation, were found for the period with the lowest production, i. e. winter. The differences between rootstocks in average production per year was less (about 60 %). The highest production was found for R. 'Varlon' on its own roots and R. indica 'Major', the lowest for both R. canina types, irrespective of the method of propagation, and R. zigrii. Further, it proved that some of the rootstocks exceeded others during the whole year, whereas some diverged only in some periods. The high production of R. 'Varlon' might be related to the abscence of the graft union. The number of axillary buds per plant and the number of released buds, but also the readiness to break out and, thereafter, the time required to develop a harvestable flower, are important factors in determining the total amount of flowers produced. In this study it was shown that the differences found in bud break between rootstocks during the year explained, at least partly, the differences found in production between rootstocks and between the seasons of the year. Also, flower stem development after axillary bud break proved to be dependent on rootstock. The importance of the presence of the subtending leaf and the diameter of the parent shoot depends on the chosen rootstock. This in turn depends on the method of carbohydrate supply (from actual photosynthesis or from storage) for the release of the bud and the development of the young shoot. The effect of rootstock on production (number of flowers) {{as well as on the}} quality of the harvested flower (length and weight) was more pronounced in winter than it was in summer. The quality parameters used were well correlated. However, the flower stem length was less influenced by season than flower weight. Finally, using the data from the long term R. 'Varlon' experiment, production and quality were quantified by linear regression models, using the plant development parameters, irrespective of the rootstock, as regressors. Production as well as quality was (partly) explained, for each season, by the transverse sections of the branches of the bottom-breaks. The number of bottombreaks was less important for production, even less than the number of their laterals; the former parameter is only of importance for production in spring and summer. The importance of the transverse sections is probably due to their role in the storage of reserves and transport capacity. Therefore, easiness of bud break and the time required for flower development is better when emerging from thick parent shoots. This is especially emphasized by the more pronounced role of the transverse section of the shoot for production in winter and for production by older bushes. It was suggested, when comparing the data concerning bush development parameters at the start and after three years, that the development of the plant in the first six months after planting was important for the building up of the rose bush and therefore for production and quality throughout its whole life. In Part II, examination of the plant's root system revealed that root fresh weight for the root systems used as rootstock for R. 'Varlon' differed markedly after three years. The root system of R. 'Mme Alfred Carrière' had 40 % less weight compared with R. 'Moonlight'. Further, some evidence was found to suggest that propagation technique may play a role in root characteristics, such as root number and average root length. In this study, the shoot-root ratio of young rose plants (younger than one year), varied between three and six and proved to depend on growing technique, environmental factors and the combination of rootstock and scion cultivar used. With progressing plant age shoot-root ratio increased to 10 - 15 for three years old plants. It can be stated that the mutual influence of shoot and root, with respect to partitioning of assimilates between shoot and root, depends on the combination and can be influenced by climatic conditions, plant age and growing technique. For R. 'Varlon' grown on different root systems, a close relationship was found to exist between the plant's shoot-root ratio after three years and the ratio between total flower weight produced over three years and final root weight. It was suggested that a fixed share of assimilates of the upper parts is used for flower formation irrespective of the root genotype used. From several experiments it became clear that disturbance of the balance between shoot and root, either by shoot or root pruning, was followed by a re-establishment of the original shootroot ratio. This is achieved independently of the scion-rootstock combination used, or the age of the plant. When frequently repeated intervention was carried out by removing upper parts, the shoot- root ratio reached a new stable balance but at a lower level. It was suggested that in this case storage of reserves was taken over by the roots. In experiments with rooted leaf cuttings it was found that a surplus of assimilates can be reflected in a higher root mass. On the other hand, it was also found that a higher root mass can indicate that the sink activity and/or storage capacity of the root is higher. The amount of carbohydrates stored in the roots of a rose plant during the year is related to the development of the shoot and root and the photosynthetic activity of the leaves. It was shown that apart from the time of year the combination of scion and rootstock used also had a prominent effect. With respect to the storage of carbohydrates in rose roots, it became clear that rootstocks originating from 'winter active' plants, such as R. multiflora 'Multic' and R. indica 'Major' showed a less pronounced variation during winter, compared with the originally hardier ones such as the R. canina types. Further, aspects such as the difference in storage capacity, sink activity, redistribution and climatic factors may play a role in the storage of carbohydrates in roots. Root growth was related to the presence of leaves. Consequently the removal of leaves by harvesting flower stems or other methods of shoot pruning, resulted in inhibited root growth within one or two weeks. Additionally, root mortality may occur depending on the severity of pruning. The extent of root mortality proved to be dependent to some degree on the rootstockused. Their susceptibility to root mortality depended on the amount of carbohydrates stored, internal competition between roots and shoot-root competition. After root mortality the best root regeneration was observed when more carbohydrates were available. This means that a root system with a higher storage capacity (i. e. mostly thicker roots), plants with more leaves, plants grown under a higher light intensity, or plants treated with supplementary sucrose, showed better root regeneration. Stimulating the root's sink activity by application of auxin improved root regeneration too. The optimal concentration of auxin (IBA) applied for root regeneration was dependent on the temperature used for plant growth. With respect to temperature, root regeneration was optimal around 17 °C. Root growth of R. canina 'Inermis' plants grown in peat was not limited between pH values 4 to 8. Root growth for plants grown on hydroculture was optimal when pH was about 6. Dormant plants only remained inactive at a pH of 3. 5 or lower, but young active roots disintegrated within a few hours at this pH value. Bud release was inhibited at pH levels that hampered root growth, probably because production of cytokinin remained behind. Reduced root growth during a short period or to a relatively low extent was not necessarily damaging for the plant. In fact, shoot growth was enhanced when root mass was decreased temporarily by removing root ends. The emergence after a while of a higher number of root apices, suggested that the imroved shoot growth was due to a higher production of cytokinin. A more pronounced reduction of root growth led to less shoot development, more water stress and a higher susceptibility to disease. In conclusion, it may be said that the whole life of a rose plant and therefore also flower production and quality, is influenced by competition between upper parts and roots. Good development requires not only an adequate assimilating system but also good storage and redistribution capabilities. Storage capacity is of especial importance during unfavourable conditions. For optimal production throughout the year, the roots should be active and after mortality, a quick recovery is required to ensure the correct balance between shoot and root. In this respect the behaviour of the rootstock plays an important role. Therefore, new scion cultivars should be assessed when growing on rootstocks which have adapted properly to the grower's method of plant management and his growing conditions. Cultivars for year round production for instance should never be tested on R. canina selections, due to their poor winter activity. For the correct balance between shoot and root, plant management should he carried out in dependence of climatic conditions, <b>rooting</b> medium, <b>scion</b> and rootstock combination and plant condition itself. The requirements for the ideal rootstock as well as for the ideal scion cultivar are tremendous. Therefore, it is more practical to select rootstock and scion cultivars in separate programmes. Finally, the most suitable combination for a certain situation could then be combined by grafting...|$|R
