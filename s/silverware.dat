5|$|Around 1830, Providence had {{manufacturing}} {{industries in}} metals, machinery, textiles, jewelry, and <b>silverware.</b> Manufacturing has declined since, {{but the city}} {{is still one of}} the largest centers for jewelry and <b>silverware</b> design and manufacturing. Services also make up a large portion of the city's economy, in particular education, healthcare, and finance. Providence also is the site of a sectional center facility (SCF), a regional hub for the U.S. Postal Service. It is the capital of Rhode Island, so the city's economy additionally consists of government services.|$|E

5|$|As of 2017, it is {{the only}} {{instance}} in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The match is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for <b>silverware</b> regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, church {{officials}} threatened to close St Peter's Church after being refused permission to sell <b>silverware</b> {{to pay for}} urgent repairs. The Archdeacon, the Venerable Michael Adie, ruled that such sales were against church policy, and that funds must be raised locally.|$|E

5|$|After {{the players}} had {{collected}} their medals, UEFA president Lennart Johansson {{handed over the}} trophy to Bülent Korkmaz. Korkmaz celebrated by raising the <b>silverware,</b> together with Şükür {{and the rest of}} the Galatasaray squad on the podium, including the ejected Hagi himself as golden confetti rained down. In a press conference room, a selected UEFA panel named Taffarel as the man of the match, by awarding him a match trophy.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, Providence {{was one of}} the wealthiest cities in the United States. Immigrant labor powered one of the nation's largest {{industrial}} manufacturing centers. Providence was a major manufacturer of industrial products from steam engines to precision tools to <b>silverware,</b> screws, and textiles. Giant companies were based in or near Providence, such as Brown & Sharpe, the Corliss Steam Engine Company, Babcock & Wilcox, the Grinnell Corporation, the Gorham Manufacturing Company, Nicholson File, and the Fruit of the Loom textile company.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this was}} another {{temporary}} home. The club stayed here until 1905, when they moved into Windsor Park. The club's first <b>silverware</b> at Windsor arrived in the 1906–07 season, with the club lifting both the league title and the County Antrim Shield. This {{would be the first}} of a trio of league titles, with the 1907–08 and 1908–09 league titles to follow.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday morning 20 June two {{defendants}} were indicted for stealing <b>silverware</b> {{from the home}} of Rev. J. Vachell in Littleport and one was charged with receiving the stolen goods. Four witnesses called were Elizabeth Carter following which Mr Justice Burrough summed up. Lavender was pronounced guilty of the theft and Beamiss and Butcher received not guilty verdicts.|$|E
5|$|Rosický {{began the}} season with his second <b>silverware</b> for Arsenal, playing the last 20 minutes of the 30 win over Manchester City in the 2014 FA Community Shield, in place of Santi Cazorla. In his first league start of the season, on 26 December 2014, Rosický scored Arsenal's second goal in a 21 home win against Queens Park Rangers, set up by Alexis Sánchez.|$|E
5|$|<b>Silverware</b> is common, but food is {{traditionally}} manipulated {{with the right}} hand. Breakfast consists of leftovers of bread and fruit with coffee or tea. Generally breakfast is made from wheat flour in various different foods such as puff-puff (doughnuts), accra banana made from bananas and flour, bean cakes and many more. Snacks are popular, especially in larger towns where they may be bought from street vendors.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} serving pieces was also symbolic. In 2009, the group used <b>silverware</b> from the Truman administration, remembering Truman {{as the first}} President to {{recognize}} Israel. In 2013, Israel First Lady Sara Netanyahu gave as a gift a Seder Plate, which was used each year at the dinner. Those in attendance read from the Maxwell House Haggadah, which is widely used in Jewish homes.|$|E
5|$|The church {{contains}} a 6th-century inscribed stone found near the village, a medieval font, and some 17th-century decorated wooden panels from Jesus College, Oxford, which was formerly {{connected with the}} church. St Edern's also owns three pieces of 19th-century church <b>silverware,</b> but a silver chalice dated 1574 was lost some time during the 19th century. An 18th-century gallery at the west end rests on two oak crossbeams, {{one of which was}} previously used to support the rood loft.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} executions Calcraft carried out is unrecorded, {{but it has}} been {{estimated}} at 450, of whom 35 were women, making him one of the most active of British executioners. Among his better-known victims was François Courvoisier, executed on 6 July 1840 outside Newgate Prison. Courvoisier had been valet to Lord William Russell, and had murdered his master after being caught stealing <b>silverware</b> from the household.|$|E
5|$|Argo Tea {{advocates for}} sustainability, {{demonstrates}} concern {{and awareness of}} environmental issues in their business plan and uses charitable donations to promote research as noted above. The company has an environmentally friendly business plan that includes encouraging use of reusable service-ware such as ceramic mugs and plates and washable <b>silverware</b> by its dine-in customers. Argo also markets reusable tea tumblers, which enable its customers to obtain discounted pricing on its drinks. The company considers sustainability and environmental consciousness in all phases of its business including supplier, operations, store design and product decisions.|$|E
5|$|During 2013–14, Wenger {{celebrated his}} 1,000th game {{in charge of}} Arsenal {{and in the process}} became the fourth manager in English {{football}} (after Sir Matt Busby, Dario Gradi and Sir Alex Ferguson) to do so. The match however did not go as Wenger planned, as the team were beaten 6–0 by Chelsea. Wenger guided Arsenal to further FA Cup success {{at the end of the}} season, after a period of nine years without <b>silverware.</b> His team retained the cup the following year, and victory against Chelsea in the 2017 final placed Wenger as the most successful manager in the competition's history with seven trophies. Wenger is contracted to Arsenal until 2019.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Mangnall was {{the first}} man to bring any major <b>silverware</b> to the club, winning the club's first ever Football League title in 1908. This was {{followed}} by the FA Cup the following season, and another league title in 1911. Despite this success, though, he left the club a year later to join local rivals Manchester City. Coincidentally, Mangnall's last match in charge of United was the Old Trafford derby of 7 September 1912. John Bentley took over as club secretary, but was replaced two years later by Jack Robson, who became the club's first full-time manager. He remained in the post for seven years, but resigned in December 1921 after succumbing to a bout of pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|Following a spell in England {{playing for}} Sheffield Wednesday and Grimsby Town, Roy Coyle joined the club as player-manager, {{taking over the}} reigns from {{outgoing}} manager Billy Campbell. After a tough start to his managerial career at the club, Coyle {{went on to become}} the most successful Linfield manager in history, winning numerous trophies during his time at Windsor Park. His first season in charge was without <b>silverware.</b> In fact, having been Irish Cup runners-up the previous season when Coleraine defeated the Blues 1–0 after two replays, Linfield suffered one of the biggest upsets in Northern Irish football history when B Division club Carrick Rangers defeated the Blues 2–1 in the 1975–76 Irish Cup final on 10 April 1976. This giant-killing act in which a junior club defeated a senior club in the Irish Cup final had only happened twice before in the cup's history, and not since 1955 – 21 years earlier. The club stuck by Coyle however, and it was not long before he brought <b>silverware</b> to the club. His first honour arrived in the 1976–77 season in the form of the County Antrim Shield. However, the Blues suffered defeat in the Irish Cup final for the third consecutive season when they once again lost out against Coleraine – losing 4–1. The 1977–78 season saw the club win an Irish League, Irish Cup and Ulster Cup treble. Runners-up in the last three Irish Cup finals, this time they were not to be denied. A 3–1 victory over Ballymena United secured the club's third trophy of the season.|$|E
5|$|Gourcuff {{began the}} 2009–10 season {{claiming}} his fourth <b>silverware</b> with Bordeaux on 25 July 2009, winning the 2009 Trophée des Champions title in a 2–0 victory over Guingamp. As {{a result of}} his performance, he was named Man of the Match. Two weeks later, he scored a double in the club's opening match of the league season against Lens. The final result was 4–1. The victory set a record in league play for most consecutive wins for the club with 12. On 23 August, he scored another set of goals, this time against Nice in a 4–0 victory.|$|E
5|$|He {{began his}} career at Corinthians, and after winning the 2012 Copa Libertadores he moved to Roma for an {{eventual}} fee of €3million. Marquinhos was a regular in his only season as Roma reached the Coppa Italia Final. In July 2013, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain for €31.4million on a five-year contract, {{one of the highest}} fees for a player under the age of 20. He won 12 items of <b>silverware</b> at the club, including the Ligue 1 title in each of his first three seasons. Marquinhos played less frequently after the acquisition of compatriot David Luiz in 2014, returning to an integral role after the latter was sold in 2016.|$|E
5|$|In 1955–56, Porto {{lifted the}} Taça de Portugal {{for the first}} time, {{and in doing so}} secured their first league and cup double. The {{following}} season saw the club's international stage premiere in the European Cup. Thirty years later, Porto beat Bayern Munich in the 1987 European Cup Final to win their maiden European <b>silverware.</b> The following season brought the club further successes in the UEFA Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup. Since taking their first Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira title in 1981, Porto have a record of 20 wins in 29 appearances, more than any other winner combined.|$|E
5|$|In the 1959–60 season, the K's {{had their}} first Wembley Stadium {{appearance}} in the FA Amateur Cup final, which was lost to Hendon F.C. 2–1. In 1963, Kingstonian won the double; the Surrey and London Senior Cup. The 1970s were a period of decline for the club, and despite becoming professional in 1975, they were relegated to Division One in 1979. In 1985 Kingstonian were once again promoted to the Isthmian League, finishing second. In 1987, 20 years without <b>silverware</b> was ended by the K's winning the London Senior Cup.|$|E
5|$|It was contested by Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur in {{a repeat}} of the 2008 Football League Cup Final, which the latter team won. Chelsea won 2–0 in the 2015 final, with a goal from captain John Terry {{at the end of the}} first half, and a second from Diego Costa in the 56th minute. It was Chelsea's fifth League Cup win, and their first <b>silverware</b> in the second {{managerial}} spell of José Mourinho at the club. Chelsea qualified for the next season's UEFA Europa League by winning the match, but eventually qualified for the UEFA Champions League by winning the Premier League. The Europa League place went to Liverpool, who finished sixth in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Leeds {{qualified}} for the UEFA Cup through finishing fourth in the 1998–99 Premier League. They reached the semi-final after defeating Partizan, Lokomotiv Moscow, Spartak Moscow, Roma and Slavia Prague. Galatasaray {{qualified for}} the UEFA Cup by finishing third in the group stage in the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League. They entered the third round defeating Bologna, Borussia Dortmund and Mallorca {{en route to the}} semi-final. Galatasaray had a reputation of a creating a hostile atmosphere surrounding their home matches and Leeds travelled there aiming to reach the UEFA Cup Final in order to win in their last chance of <b>silverware</b> of their season.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{became the}} first team to win the European Cup or Champions League without being the champions of Europe or champions of their country the {{preceding}} season. They had finished second in the 1997–98 season to Arsenal, but had qualified through UEFA's expanded format, which had been introduced a season earlier. Had Bayern won the cup, they would have become {{the first team to}} achieve this feat, having also finished second in the Bundesliga to Kaiserslautern the season before. While Manchester United finished the season as Treble champions, Bayern ultimately lost the DFB-Pokal final to Werder Bremen, which meant they finished the season with the Bundesliga title as their only <b>silverware.</b>|$|E
5|$|Silver {{is used in}} {{numerous}} applications other than as currency, such as solar panels, water filtration, jewellery, ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term <b>silverware),</b> and as an investment medium (coins and bullion) Silver is used industrially in electrical contacts and conductors, in specialized mirrors, window coatings, and in catalysis of chemical reactions. Silver compounds are used in photographic film and X-rays. Dilute silver nitrate solutions and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides (oligodynamic effect), added to bandages and wound-dressings, catheters, and other medical instruments.|$|E
5|$|Sir Robert Menzies, the Australian politician, {{became the}} Lord Warden in 1965 and visited the castle {{on an annual}} basis, staying in the flat there. Elizabeth the Queen Mother {{followed}} Menzies in 1978, initially visiting the castle from the Royal Yacht, but from 1986 onwards taking over the entire castle for three days each July. This required moving furniture, <b>silverware</b> and other furnishings from London and caused difficulties for English Heritage, who managed the property. The current Lord Warden, Admiral the Lord Boyce, took up his post in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Socially, {{economic}} dynamism {{opened up}} one of the avenues of social mobility in the Roman Empire. Social advancement was thus not dependent solely on birth, patronage, good luck, or even extraordinary ability. Although aristocratic values permeated traditional elite society, a strong tendency towards plutocracy is indicated by the wealth requirements for census rank. Prestige could be obtained through investing one's wealth in ways that advertised it appropriately: grand country estates or townhouses, durable luxury items such as jewels and <b>silverware,</b> public entertainments, funerary monuments for family members or coworkers, and religious dedications such as altars. Guilds (collegia) and corporations (corpora) provided support for individuals to succeed through networking, sharing sound business practices, and a willingness to work.|$|E
5|$|Success {{finally arrived}} during the 2001–02 season. Arsenal {{finished}} seven points above Liverpool {{to win the}} Premier League title, and defeated Chelsea 2–0 in the FA Cup Final. Henry became the league's top goalscorer and netted 32 goals in all competitions as he led Arsenal to a double and his first <b>silverware</b> with the club. There was much expectation that Henry would replicate his club form for France during the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but the defending champions suffered a shock exit at the group stage.|$|E
5|$|The 2011–12 {{season was}} Gary Mills' first full season as York City manager, having {{taken over the}} role in October 2010. York {{finished}} the season with two major trophies after victories in the 2012 FA Trophy Final and the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final, {{both of which were}} staged at Wembley Stadium. The FA Trophy victory represented York's first piece of <b>silverware</b> in 19 years and was achieved with a 2–0 victory over York's Conference Premier rivals Newport County. With goals from Ashley Chambers and Matty Blair, York beat Luton Town 2–1 in the play-off final to return to the Football League after an eight-year absence with promotion to League Two.|$|E
5|$|The {{indirect}} {{exchange of}} goods on land along the Silk Road and sea routes included Chinese silk, Roman glassware and high-quality cloth. Roman coins minted from the 1st century AD onwards {{have been found in}} China, as well as a coin of Maximian and medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius in Jiaozhi in modern Vietnam, the same region at which Chinese sources claim the Romans first landed. Roman glassware and <b>silverware</b> have been discovered at Chinese archaeological sites dated to the Han period. Roman coins and glass beads have also been found in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} to Virginia House is elegant with oak {{furnishings and}} an assortment of English and Spanish antiques, oriental carpets, silks, and <b>silverware.</b> The first floor consists mainly of large, elaborate rooms, intended for social meetings and to house the functions and exhibits of the Virginia Historical Society. The second floor was mainly designed to be used as the private living quarters of the Weddells and their staff and featured a large library, which now functions as the boardroom and research facility of the Virginia Historical Society.|$|E
5|$|The major use {{of silver}} besides coinage {{throughout}} most of history was {{in the manufacture of}} jewellery and other general-use items, and this continues to be a major use today. Examples include table silver for cutlery, for which silver is highly suited due to its antibacterial properties. Western concert flutes are usually plated with or made out of sterling silver; in fact, most <b>silverware</b> is only silver-plated rather than made out of pure silver; the silver is normally put in place by electroplating. Silver-plated glass (as opposed to metal) is used for mirrors, vacuum flasks, and Christmas tree decorations.|$|E
