5|$|Breathing air is {{primarily}} {{of use to}} fish that inhabit shallow, <b>seasonally</b> variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may <b>seasonally</b> decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that {{is little more than}} wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns.|$|E
5|$|Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical <b>seasonally</b> wet or flooded lowland grassland, swamps, mangroves, and heavily degraded former forest. It may wander over dry fields and clearings. It is not generally found in high-altitude regions.|$|E
5|$|Like most seabirds, the {{majority}} of procellariids breed once a year. There are exceptions; many individuals of the larger species, such as the white-headed petrel, will skip a breeding season after successfully fledging a chick, {{and some of the}} smaller species, such as the Christmas shearwaters, breed on a nine-month schedule. Among those that breed annually, there is considerable variation as to the timing; some species breed in a fixed season while others breed all year round. Climate and the availability of food resources are important influences on the timing of procellariid breeding; species that breed at higher latitudes always breed in the summer as conditions are too harsh in the winter. At lower latitudes many, but not all, species breed continuously. Some species breed <b>seasonally,</b> to avoid competition with other species for burrows, to avoid predation or to take advantage of <b>seasonally</b> abundant food. Others, such as the tropical wedge-tailed shearwater, breed <b>seasonally</b> for reasons unknown. Among the species that exhibit seasonal breeding there can be high levels of synchronization, both of time of arrival at the colony and of lay date.|$|E
5|$|Main pond, dug in 1986, with <b>seasonally</b> {{fluctuating}} water levels. Most vegetation has colonised naturally, with {{among others}} common reed, purple loosestrife, yellow iris, water-plantain, water figwort, soft rush, gypsywort, water starwort, curled pondweed, common duckweed, water forget-me-not, water mint, brooklime.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eastern}} side is a <b>seasonally</b> {{inhabited}} permanent fishers' camp. There is an unnamed lighthouse on the western side, a trig point on {{the eastern side}}, and a gravel airstrip near the centre.|$|E
5|$|The Alamogordo Family Recreation Center, at 1100 Oregon Avenue, is a city-owned {{facility}} {{offering a}} weight room, swimming pool (open <b>seasonally),</b> and basketball gym. There are outdoor tennis courts {{north of the}} building.|$|E
5|$|The Newark Boys Chorus, {{founded in}} 1966, {{performs}} {{regularly in the}} city. The African Globe Theater Works presents a new works <b>seasonally.</b> The biennial Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival took place in Newark {{for the first time}} in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The species migrates <b>seasonally,</b> at night, and can {{be carried}} {{downwind}} up to 400km. Pupae can make use of diapause to wait out adverse environmental conditions, especially at high latitudes and in drought.|$|E
5|$|As with Boumba-Bek to the northeast, {{the main}} type of forest is semi-evergreen {{with an open}} canopy {{dominated}} by the 50–60 m Triplochiton, though it is mixed with large patches of closed evergreens. There are also some <b>seasonally</b> flooded Uapaca trees along the Dja River.|$|E
5|$|In many decapods, {{the first}} (and {{sometimes}} the second) pair of pleopods are specialised {{in the male}} for sperm transfer. Many terrestrial crustaceans (such as the Christmas Island red crab) mate <b>seasonally</b> {{and return to the}} sea to release the eggs. Others, such as woodlice, lay their eggs on land, albeit in damp conditions. In most decapods, the females retain the eggs until they hatch into free-swimming larvae.|$|E
5|$|The Depot Town Farmers' Market, one of Ypsilanti's two farmers' markets, began near {{downtown}} in 1919, moving {{several times before}} settling in the freighthouse in the late 1970s. Inside the freighthouse, the market operated year-round, and included a coffee shop and frequent live music. Since the 2004 closure of the freighthouse due to structural concerns, the farmers' market has operated <b>seasonally</b> only, in the courtyard just outside the freighthouse.|$|E
5|$|The United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics {{unemployment}} rate (not <b>seasonally</b> adjusted) for the Mobile Metropolitan Statistical Area was 7.5% for July 2013, {{compared with an}} unadjusted rate of 6.6% for Alabama {{as a whole and}} 7.4% for the entire nation.|$|E
5|$|The holly-leaved banksia gives {{its name}} to the Banksia ilicifolia {{woodlands}} ('community type 22'), a possibly threatened ecological community found in the Bassendean and Spearwood systems in the central Swan Coastal Plain north of Rockingham. These are low-lying areas which are <b>seasonally</b> waterlogged. The habitat is open woodland and with an open understorey, and such trees as B. ilicifolia, B. attenuata and stout paperbark (Melaleuca preissiana).|$|E
5|$|The last {{family to}} live in the home was the Longfellow family, who {{established}} the Longfellow Trust in 1913 for its preservation. In 1972, the home and all of its furnishings was donated to, and was made part of, the National Park Service. The home, which represents the mid-Georgian architectural style, is <b>seasonally</b> open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The {{power station}} {{is on the}} A85 road, about 8 km or 5 miles west of Dalmally, on a branch of Loch Awe leading to the River Awe, which is the outflow from the loch, at its NW corner. There is a <b>seasonally</b> open Falls of Cruachan railway station nearby.|$|E
5|$|The shrub grows amongst {{scrubland}} in <b>seasonally</b> wet lowland {{areas of}} the coastal sandplain between Badgingarra and Serpentine in Western Australia. A little studied species, not much is known of its ecology or conservation biology. Reports do suggest, however, that it is pollinated {{by a variety of}} birds and small mammals. Like many members of series Abietinae, it has not been considered to have much horticultural potential and is rarely cultivated.|$|E
5|$|The western painted turtle's {{consumption}} {{of plants and}} animals changes <b>seasonally.</b> In early summer, 60% of its diet comprises insects. In late summer, 55% includes plants. Of note, the western painted turtle aids in the dispersal of white water-lily seeds. The turtle consumes the hard-coated seeds, which remain viable after passing through the turtle, and disperses them through its feces.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{relatively}} mild temperate climate with ample precipitation, the areas around Image Lake boast rich natural habitats with many species of plants, insects, rodents, and large mammals. Native Americans took advantage of these resources, and may have inhabited the area <b>seasonally.</b> However, human activity such as hunting, fishing, and mining, and recreational overuse increased after the arrival of Europeans. As a result, some areas experienced significant environmental degradation {{near the end of the}} nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, including the eradication of large predatory animals. Recreational overuse and the presence of livestock were especially problematic in the early to mid-twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the greater}} {{investment}} in raising the young and because foraging for food may occur far from the nest site, in all seabird species except the phalaropes, both parents participate in caring for the young, and pairs are typically at least <b>seasonally</b> monogamous. Many species, such as gulls, auks and penguins, retain the same mate for several seasons, and many petrel species mate for life. Albatrosses and procellariids, which mate for life, take many years to form a pair bond before they breed, and the albatrosses have an elaborate breeding dance {{that is part of}} pair-bond formation.|$|E
5|$|Burrowing seabirds such as petrels, prions, and shearwaters {{share the}} tuatara's island habitat during the birds' nesting seasons. The tuatara use the birds' burrows for shelter when available, or dig their own. The seabirds' guano helps to {{maintain}} invertebrate populations on which tuatara predominantly prey; including beetles, crickets, and spiders. Their diets also consist of frogs, lizards, and bird's eggs and chicks. The eggs and young of seabirds that are <b>seasonally</b> available as food for tuatara may provide beneficial fatty acids. Tuatara {{of both sexes}} defend territories, and will threaten and eventually bite intruders. The bite can cause serious injury. Tuatara will bite when approached, and will not let go easily.|$|E
5|$|Disturbance {{has been}} implicated in the {{formation}} of vegetation dominated by large Attalea species. In <b>seasonally</b> dry Amazonian forests the density of large adult A.maripa palms was correlated with canopy openness; the species also dominates savannas formed by repeated forest fires in Trinidad and Tobago. Attalea speciosa forms pure stands in many parts of Brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared. Similarly, stands of A.funifera in Bahia, Brazil (which are cultivated for piassava fibre) are managed using fire—the seedlings survive cutting and burning, and are able to dominate burned forest patches.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, {{he became}} {{co-owner}} of a jazz club and bar that operated <b>seasonally</b> in Maine; {{he spent the}} off-season acting on stage in southern California. He auditioned for the television series M*A*S*H (1972–83) without success. By 1980, he was working in Los Angeles as an actor, appearing in films, television programs, live performances, and commercials. He portrayed roles in commercials for stock brokerage firms Dean Witter, as the company spokesman, and Paine Webber, as an executive.|$|E
5|$|Forest fires <b>seasonally</b> {{clear the}} park of dead vegetation, making way for new growth. These fires damage the income {{generated}} by tourism. The Summer of Fire saw more resources {{dedicated to the}} subject of wildfire than ever before or since in the United States. The Rim Fire in 2013 destroyed nearly $2 billion in assets and revenue, though natural woodland assets are renewable, and closed off much of the park to tourists. This rim fire was the third largest on record, and burned nearly 500 acres of wild habitat.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, 14.43% of {{the houses}} in Juniata County were vacant. 9.42% of the county's houses were vacant for {{seasonal}} or recreational reasons. The county's vacancy rate is higher than average for Pennsylvania. Mifflintown had the lowest vacancy rate of any township or borough in the county (5.18%). Lack Township had the highest vacancy rate (48.77%). 66.49% of the county's houses are occupied by their owner and 19.08% are occupied by a renter. Many {{of the houses}} in the southwestern {{part of the county}} are <b>seasonally</b> occupied.|$|E
5|$|In the First World War, firing and {{observation}} positions were hand-painted in disruptive patterns by artists known as camoufleurs, and they sometimes varied their patterns <b>seasonally.</b> Uniforms were largely {{of a single}} colour, such as the British khaki; but snow camouflage clothes came into use in some armies by 1917. For example, Austro-Hungarian troops on the Italian front used skis and wore snow camouflage smocks and overtrousers over their uniforms, and improvised white cloths over their uniform caps.|$|E
5|$|In the Pacific, {{migration}} {{patterns are}} poorly characterized. Although some fin whales are apparently present year-round in the Gulf of California, {{there is a}} significant increase in their numbers in the winter and spring. Southern fin whales migrate <b>seasonally</b> from relatively high-latitude Antarctic feeding grounds in the summer to low-latitude breeding and calving areas in the winter. The location of winter breeding areas is still unknown, since these whales tend to migrate in the open ocean.|$|E
5|$|Industrialized {{societies}} generally {{follow a}} clock-based schedule for daily activities {{that do not}} change {{throughout the course of}} the year. The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change <b>seasonally</b> because of the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of the tropics daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the further one moves away from the tropics.|$|E
5|$|Intercity bus {{services}} run {{by multiple}} private companies connect all major cities. They {{are the most}} popular means of transportation followed by the rail service Camrail. Rail service runs from Kumba in the west to Bélabo in the east and north to Ngaoundéré. International airports are located in Douala and Yaoundé, with a third under construction in Maroua. Douala is the country's principal seaport. In the north, the Bénoué River is <b>seasonally</b> navigable from Garoua across into Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|It {{is a white}} bird {{adorned with}} buff plumes in the {{breeding}} season. It nests in colonies, usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds. The nest is a platform of sticks in trees or shrubs. Cattle egrets exploit drier and open habitats more than other heron species. Their feeding habitats include <b>seasonally</b> inundated grasslands, pastures, farmlands, wetlands and rice paddies. They often accompany cattle or other large mammals, catching insect and small vertebrate prey disturbed by these animals. Some populations of the cattle egret are migratory and others show post-breeding dispersal.|$|E
5|$|Mint is {{a premium}} airline product offered by JetBlue on some flights between the West Coast and the East Coast of the {{contiguous}} United States, and <b>seasonally</b> on some flights between the United States and Caribbean destinations. The service is operated with {{a fleet of}} Airbus A321 aircraft in a premium configuration, with lie-flat seats in premium class. As of May 2016, JetBlue is the only low cost airline in the Americas offering a dedicated premium product.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bears are}} {{opportunistic}} omnivores and consume more plant than animal matter. They eat anything from leaves, roots, and berries to insects, carrion, fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems and teeth adapted {{to such a}} diet. At the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. However, all bears feed on any food source that becomes <b>seasonally</b> available. For example, Asiatic black bears in Taiwan consume large numbers of acorns when these are most common, and switch to ungulates at other times of the year.|$|E
5|$|Only {{insects that}} live in nests or colonies {{demonstrate}} any true capacity for fine-scale spatial orientation or homing. This can allow an insect to return unerringly to a single hole a few millimeters in diameter among thousands of apparently identical holes clustered together, after a trip of up to several kilometers' distance. In a phenomenon known as philopatry, insects that hibernate have shown the ability to recall a specific location {{up to a year}} after last viewing the area of interest. A few insects <b>seasonally</b> migrate large distances between different geographic regions (e.g., the overwintering areas of the monarch butterfly).|$|E
5|$|Otters {{may prefer}} {{to feed on}} crustaceans, {{especially}} crayfish (Cambarus, Pacifasticus, and others) more than fish where they are locally and <b>seasonally</b> plentiful. In Georgia, crayfish accounted for two-thirds of the prey in the summer diet, and their remnants were present in 98% of the summer spraint. In the winter, crayfish made up one-third of the otter's diet. A study conducted on North American river otters in a southwestern Arkansas swamp identified a correlation between crayfish consumption, fish consumption, and water levels.|$|E
5|$|P.simplex inhabits open, usually humid {{tropical}} and subtropical lowlands. In Argentina, it {{is mainly}} {{a species of}} the eastern Chaco and in Brazil it {{is found in the}} Cerrado and Caatinga. Most specimens for which habitat data are known were caught on the ground in humid grassland, some in <b>seasonally</b> flooded areas; an Argentinean specimen was captured in dense swamp vegetation. It is terrestrial and semiaquatic, living on the ground but also spending time in the water.|$|E
5|$|Population size {{is usually}} largest {{during the summer}} and declines during winter, {{although}} populations in Texas and Louisiana may be more <b>seasonally</b> stable. Animals also often lose weight during winter. Population size varies dramatically from year to year in southern Texas. In coastal Mississippi, storms probably do not cause the population to decline substantially, and in Texas, inundation of its habitat did not significantly influence population density. However, in Mississippi, flooding did cause a marked decline in rice rat abundance.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, the Natal {{red rock}} hare has been rated {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is because it is widespread, having a large range—more than —and {{although}} its range and population are decreasing, the number of mature individuals in the wild is above 10,000. It is abundant within its range in provincial parks, national parks, and wildlife refugees, and is also protected by Provincial Nature Conservation agencies <b>seasonally,</b> as a game species.|$|E
