60|$|Thus, as {{it seems}} to me, the leading facts in embryology, which are <b>second</b> in {{importance}} <b>to</b> <b>none</b> in natural history, are explained on the principle of slight modifications not appearing, in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor, at a very early period in the life of each, though perhaps caused at the earliest, and being inherited at a corresponding not early period. Embryology rises greatly in interest, when we thus look at the embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of the common parent-form of each great class of animals.|$|R

It is otherwise little mentioned in ancient literature.

By nature Munch was very introvert, and not one who would easily connect with other people.

His work ethic was, however, <b>second</b> <b>to</b> <b>none,</b> and his output in terms of books, pamphlets, articles (both academic and for newspapers), letters, diaries and other notes, is immense.|$|E

25|$|As the Scots Greys were {{returning}} home, Britain {{was in the}} process of reorganising the army in the aftermath of the Union of England and Scotland. The British government was trying to make it more uniform, as well as sorting out the question of which regiment took precedence over which. An examination of the records revealed that the designation of the Scots Greys as the 4th regiment of dragoons was improper. At the time they entered the service, in 1685, there had been only one other regiment of dragoons in service. However, the senior English dragoon regiment was raised after the Scots Greys was first formed. Although this would mean that the Scots Greys should be designated as the first dragoon regiment, there was a problem. The Royal Scots were already due to be redesignated as the first regiment of infantry. To blend the English and Scottish military establishments together, a compromise was reached. The English dragoon regiment would be designated as the first, and the Scots Greys would become the second. Therefore, the Scots Greys were redesignated as the 2nd Royal North British Dragoons (and hence the motto <b>Second</b> <b>to</b> <b>None).</b>|$|E

The game finally kicked off an hour late, finishing goalless in front of 32,000 spectators. The Birmingham Daily Post editorial next day suggested that [...] "the {{fact that so many}} spectators attended under such adverse conditions augurs well for the step that the directors have taken", and that the directors were [...] "to be congratulated in having provided their supporters with a ground <b>second</b> <b>to</b> <b>none</b> in the country".|$|E
500|$|Alexander rebuilt Lincoln Cathedral {{after it}} had been {{destroyed}} by fire at an unknown date. He had the roof done with stone vaulting and began construction of the west front of the cathedral, which was finished under his successor. The only remaining major traces of Alexander's work on the west end are the carved doors and the frieze on the west front. The author of the Gesta Stephani claimed that Alexander's additions made Lincoln Cathedral [...] "more beautiful than before and <b>second</b> <b>to</b> <b>none</b> in the realm". Traditionally, Alexander has been credited with the commissioning of the baptismal font in Lincoln Cathedral, made of Tournai marble. Recent scholarship, however, has cast doubt upon this theory and suggests that the font was carved on the orders of Alexander's successor, Robert de Chesney.|$|E
500|$|John Lester {{helped to}} lift Philadelphia cricket {{to the highest}} levels of {{international}} play with his leadership and understanding of the sport. He {{is one of the few}} American cricketers noted in Cricket Scores and Biographies, which said that he was [...] "a watchful batsman who could hit well and had plenty of strokes and strong defence." [...] In 1951 he authored A Century of Philadelphia Cricket, which was a definitive history of the game in the area. Lester was also integral in the foundation of the C.C. Morris Cricket Library when he proposed that cricket, [...] "with a history and literature <b>second</b> <b>to</b> <b>none</b> should be given a permanent home in the United States." [...] In 1969, he made his final public appearance at a cricket function when the library was opened at Haverford. Lester received his PhD in education from Harvard University in 1902 and for many years was head of the English department at The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania and served as a university professor. He died in 1969 and as a lasting memorial, the pavilion at Cope Field is named in his honor.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the federation in 1964, Southern Rhodesia then started calling itself Rhodesia and adopted a new flag {{at the behest of the}} Prime Minister of Rhodesia as a protest against the federation and the British government. The new flag used the same details as the previous one, but instead used a sky-blue background rather than the traditional dark blue. The new flag used the same colour as the Royal Air Force Ensign because the government wanted to make the Rhodesian flag more recognisable and it was chosen as a way to protest against the British government's treatment of Southern Rhodesia during their time as part of the Federation. After the breakup of the federation, black Rhodesians viewed the new flag as a symbol of white supremacy as it was created by Prime Minister Ian Smith's minority government and the British government did not veto the change despite having the power to do so. Following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965, Rhodesia continued to use the flag of Southern Rhodesia as a symbol of loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II, despite the British government not recognising UDI. Smith said: [...] "Let there be no doubt that we in this country stand <b>second</b> <b>to</b> <b>none</b> in our loyalty to the Queen, and whatever else other countries may have done or may yet do, it is our intention that the Union Jack will continue to fly in Rhodesia and the national anthem continue to be sung." ...|$|E

[...] Similarly, Nancy Malitz of The Detroit News wrote that [...] "you move the characters around and invent the scenarios, but in the end you might feel your creativity wasn't heavily challenged. The whole deal is essentially a cut-and-paste operation. You can't create characters of your own, and the kind of automatic synchronization of sounds with movement that you see in a simple product like Video Jam isn't available, so things look sort of choppy no matter how hard you try." ...|$|R
