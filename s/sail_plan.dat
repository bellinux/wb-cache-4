25|$|Although {{sailboat}} terminology has varied across history, many terms {{have specific}} meanings {{in the context}} of modern yachting. A great number of sailboat-types may be distinguished by size, hull configuration, keel type, purpose, number and configuration of masts, and <b>sail</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E
25|$|Orinoco {{had only}} a small amount of deck housing and was the last square-rigged sail-steamer to be built for RMSP. The Napier ships were more modern, each with a full {{superstructure}} deck and rigged as a three-masted schooner. The smaller <b>sail</b> <b>plan</b> was based on the increasing economy and reliability of their engines.|$|E

50|$|The Zephyr is a New Zealand one-design 3.35 m sailing dinghy. Zephyrs are a {{national}} class, {{administered by the}} Zephyr Owners' Association. Hull form and <b>sail</b> <b>plans</b> are restricted, to ensure all boats have the same potential speed.|$|R
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century {{people began}} to use these small boats for sport and {{recreational}} sailing, utilising the opportunities for leisure afforded by the industrial revolution. Larger privately used sailing boats had developed separately, and have resulted in the yachts of today. There has been some crossover, in that the sloop <b>sail</b> <b>plan</b> was adopted as standard and most convenient by early dinghy designers.|$|E
25|$|The {{services}} of Charles Ernest Nicholson {{were once again}} employed to design the challenger and she was constructed at the Camper and Nicholsons yard in Gosport. Shamrock V was built from wood, with mahogany planking over steel frames and, most significantly, a hollow spruce mast. As a result of rule changes, {{she was the first}} British contender for the America's Cup to carry the Bermuda rig. Following her launch on 14 April 1930 she showed early promise on the British Regatta circuit winning 15 of 22 races. She also underwent continuous upgrading with changes to her hull shape, rudder, and modifications to the rig to create a more effective racing <b>sail</b> <b>plan</b> before departing to America in time for the 15th America's Cup.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of her}} {{conversion}} to a troopship in 1851, a forecastle and poop deck {{were added to the}} Birkenhead to increase her accommodation, and a third mast added, to change her <b>sail</b> <b>plan</b> to a barquentine. [...] Although she never served as a warship, she was faster and more comfortable than any of the wooden sail-driven troopships of the time, making the trip from the Cape in 37days in October 1850.|$|E
50|$|The {{designer}} will typically {{produce an}} overall plan, a general specification describing {{the peculiarities of}} the vessel, and construction blueprints to be used at the building site. Designs for larger or more complex vessels may also include <b>sail</b> <b>plans,</b> electrical schematics, and plumbing and ventilation plans.|$|R
5000|$|Deviation Report - {{should be}} sent as soon as any voyage {{information}} changes, which could affect AMVER's ability to accurately predict the vessel's position. Changes in course or speed due to weather, ice, change in destination, or any other deviations from the original <b>Sailing</b> <b>Plan</b> should be reported as soon as possible.|$|R
50|$|Triangular sails {{have names}} {{for each of}} three edges and three corners. Rigs with such sails include Bermuda, cutter, lateen and vessels with mixed <b>sail</b> <b>plans</b> that include jibs and other staysails. Most {{triangular}} sails are classified as asymmetrical and fore and aft; symmetric spinnakers are symmetrical triangular sails that are designed for off-the-wind use.|$|R
500|$|Her {{propulsion}} system {{consisted of two}} compound steam engines that drove a pair of propellers. Steam for the engines was provided by eight coal-fired, cylindrical water-tube boilers. The boilers were split into four separate, watertight boiler rooms, and both of the steam engines were in individual engine rooms. The engines were rated at [...] and produced {{a top speed of}} [...] Almirante Brown had the capacity to store up to [...] of coal for the boilers. In addition to her steam engines, Almirante Brown was fitted with a sailing rig for auxiliary cruising. The <b>sail</b> <b>plan</b> had an area of [...]|$|E
500|$|Like other steamships of the era, Great Britain was {{provided}} with secondary sail power, consisting of one square-rigged and five schooner-rigged masts—a relatively simple <b>sail</b> <b>plan</b> {{designed to reduce}} the number of crew required. The masts were of iron, fastened to the spar deck with iron joints, and with one exception, hinged to allow their lowering to reduce wind resistance in the event of a strong headwind. The rigging was of iron cable instead of the traditional hemp, again with a view to reducing wind resistance. Another innovative feature was the lack of traditional heavy bulwarks around the main deck; a light iron railing [...] both reduced weight and allowed water shipped in heavy weather to run unimpeded back to sea.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "Laser" [...] {{is often}} used to refer to the Laser Standard (the largest of the <b>sail</b> <b>plan</b> rigs {{available}} for the Laser hull). [...] However, there are two other <b>sail</b> <b>plan</b> rigs available for the Laser Standard hull and a series of other [...] "Laser"-branded boats which are of completely different hull designs. Examples include the Laser 2 and Laser Pico. [...] The Laser Standard, Laser Radial and Laser 4.7 are three types of 'Laser' administered by the International Laser Class Association.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origins of}} the craft are not clear. A major spark in the revival of {{interest}} was the publication in 1983 of [...] "The Galway Hookers , Sailing work boats of Galway Bay" [...] (Richard J. Scott, d 24/01/08), now in its fourth edition. For the first time detailed construction and <b>sail</b> <b>plans</b> were published.|$|R
50|$|Walls {{are called}} {{bulkheads}} or ceilings, while the surfaces {{referred to as}} ceilings on land are called overheads or deckheads. Floors are called soles or decks. The toilet is traditionally called the head, the kitchen is the galley. When lines are tied off, this may {{be referred to as}} made fast or belayed. Sails in different <b>sail</b> <b>plans</b> have unchanging names, however. For the naming of sails, see sail-plan.|$|R
5000|$|The Milwaukee Community Sailing Center (...) {{is located}} north of {{downtown}} {{in the heart of}} Veterans Park at McKinley Marina. The sailing area crosses the McKinley Mooring Basin as Light and Medium Air sailors remain inside the breakwater. Heavy air sailors may sail outside the breakwater; however, before leaving the docks, sailors must develop a <b>sailing</b> <b>plan</b> based on the wind direction, keeping the safest and shortest route in mind.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fundamental}} {{cause of}} [...] "helm", be it weather or lee, {{is the relationship}} of the center of pressure of the <b>sail</b> <b>plan</b> to the center of lateral resistance of the hull. If the center of pressure is astern of the center of lateral resistance, a weather helm, the tendency of the vessel is to want to turn into the wind.|$|E
2500|$|Slocum {{normally}} sailed the Spray {{without touching}} the helm. Due {{to the length}} of the <b>sail</b> <b>plan</b> relative to the hull, and the long keel, the Spray was capable of self-steering (unlike faster modern craft), and he balanced it stably on any course relative to the wind by adjusting or reefing the sails and by lashing the helm fast. He sailed [...] west across the Pacific without once touching the helm.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} 1840s, Howland & Aspinwall gave Waterman {{command of the}} clipper Sea Witch. [...] Waterman worked with the ship's designer, John W. Griffiths, {{designing}} much of the Sea Witchs rig and <b>sail</b> <b>plan,</b> specifying [...] masts and more square footage of sail than a 74-gun warship. [...] In 1847, he brought the Sea Witch from Hong Kong to New York in 77 days, beating his previous record by a day.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} with clinker built hulls, where planked edges overlap, carvel construction gives a stronger hull, {{capable of taking}} a variety of full-rigged <b>sail</b> <b>plans,</b> albeit one of greater weight. In addition, it enables greater length and breadth of hull and superior sail rigs because of its strong framing, {{and is one of}} the critical developments that led to the preeminence of Western European seapower during the Age of Sail and beyond.|$|R
50|$|Whilst {{the cutter}} rig with twin foresails {{was once the}} {{standard}} rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began {{to be replaced by}} the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around 15 m and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the yawl, ketch, schooner and even unusual <b>sail</b> <b>plans</b> such as the junk rig.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, smaller sloop and cat rigged scows became popular sailboats on inland lakes {{throughout}} the midwestern United States. First popularized by Johnson Boat Works in Minnesota, these boats were distinguished by their larger <b>sail</b> <b>plans,</b> retractable bilgeboards, and (in some classes) twin rudders. There are many active racing classes throughout the Midwest, Western New York, the New Jersey Shore {{and parts of}} the South. These boats are traditionally identified by their class letters: ...|$|R
2500|$|A smaller <b>sail</b> <b>plan</b> for the Laser was {{developed}} {{about a decade}} later. [...] The sail area was reduced by 35% from the Standard with a shorter pre-bent bottom mast section, allowing even lighter sailors to sail. The same formula as the Radial is kept. The hull {{is the same as}} the Standard and Radial. [...] Optimal weight for this rig is 121–159lb (55–72kg), thus becoming an ideal boat for young sailors moving from the Optimist/RS Tera, this is better for people who are too big for an Optimist/RS Tera and too light for a normal Laser. The Laser 4.7 rig has a UK Portsmouth Yardstick number of 1200.|$|E
2500|$|The wooden sloops of the Cruizer {{class were}} {{designed}} {{under the direction}} of Lord John Hay, and after his [...] "Committee of Reference" [...] was disbanded, their construction was supervised by the new Surveyor of the Navy, Sir Baldwin Walker. [...] Ordered together with her sister-ship Falcon on 2 April 1853, she was laid down at the Royal Dockyard, Pembroke in January 1855. [...] She was fitted at Chatham with a two-cylinder horizontal single-expansion steam engine, which was supplied by Ravenhill & Salkeld at a cost of £6,052 and generated an indicated horsepower of driving a single screw, this gave a maximum speed of [...] [...] The class was given a barque-rig <b>sail</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Wild Oats XI is a {{state-of-the-art}} maxi yacht designed by Reichel/Pugh and built by Mcconaghy Boats, {{five months after}} her near-sistership Alfa Romeo II, from which she borrowed extensively. She was launched in December 2005 after a 9-month build and won her first Sydney-Hobart the same month. She is distinctively narrow with a [...] beam and originally featured [...] "canting ballast twin foil" [...] appendages enabling her to carry a large <b>sail</b> <b>plan</b> without compromising stability. She has undergone many modifications over time to keep her competitive: In 2009 she was lengthened at bow and stern from 98ft to 100ft to meet the new limit in the Sydney-Hobart. In 2011 her forward balanced spade canard was removed and twin daggerboards were added amidships. In 2012 she received a bow centreboard as well as caudal fin winglets on her torpedo bulb. In 2013 she was equipped with a Dynamic Stability System (DSS) foil, which is a retractable horizontal foil deployed on the leeward side of the boat. In 2015 her stern was shortened by 2m and her 12m forward sections were replaced by a 14m longer, sleeker bow, keeping her midship sections unmodified and in effect moving her entire existing sailplan aft by 2m.|$|E
5000|$|Galleons were large, multi-decked sailing ships used as armed cargo {{carriers}} primarily by European {{states from the}} 16th to 18th centuries during the age of sail and were the principal fleet units drafted for use as warships until the Anglo-Dutch wars of the mid-1600s. Galleons generally carried three or more masts with a lateen fore-and-aft rig on the rear masts, were carvel built with a prominent squared off raised stern, and used square-rigged <b>sail</b> <b>plans</b> on their fore-mast and main-masts.|$|R
40|$|To study new <b>sail</b> <b>plans</b> it is {{a common}} {{practice}} to use advanced CFD tools which are able to simulate in a accurate way almost all the aerodynamic complex phenomena typical of those systems. However, these analisys are very time consuming and this could make prohibitive their massive usage for long series of analysis. A way to solve this drawback could be found in Vortex Lattice Methods (VLM) : with this technique it is possible to develop a lot of analysis, in a relative short time, in order to choose which will be the best configurations to test in detail. In the present article the results of analysis of <b>sail</b> <b>plans,</b> made with a in house software based on the VLM theory (Katz & Plotkin, 1991 and Fiddes & Gaydon, 1996) are shown. It is included an algorithm for wake relaxation. The validation of the method has been done comparing the results of the computation with those derived by the theory of elliptic wing and with available experimental tests at the wind tunnel on the sail rig of a modern racing yacht. Finally, the fluid dynamic code has been integrated with a non linear membrane FEM and an example of this application is presented...|$|R

60|$|The Arangi was a labour-recruit {{ship that}} carried the new-caught, cannibal blacks from remote islands to labour on the new {{plantations}} where white men turned dank and pestilential swamp and jungle into rich and stately cocoanut groves. The Arangi's two masts were of Oregon cedar, so scraped and hot-paraffined that they shone like tan opals {{in the glare of}} sun. Her excessive <b>sail</b> <b>plan</b> enabled her to sail like a witch, and, on occasion, gave Captain Van Horn, his white mate, and his fifteen black boat's crew {{as much as they could}} handle. She was sixty feet over all, and the cross beams of her crown deck had not been weakened by deck-houses. The only breaks--and no beams had been cut for them--were the main cabin skylight and companionway, the booby hatch for'ard over the tiny forecastle, and the small hatch aft that let down into the store-room.|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR BOB, - My {{extremely}} foolhardy venture {{is practically}} over. [...] How foolhardy it was I don't think I realised. We {{had a very}} small schooner, and, like most yachts, over-rigged and over-sparred, and like many American yachts on a very dangerous <b>sail</b> <b>plan.</b> The waters we sailed in are, of course, entirely unlighted, and very badly charted; in the Dangerous Archipelago, through which we were fools enough to go, we were perfectly in ignorance of where we were for a whole night and half the next day, and this {{in the midst of}} invisible islands and rapid and variable currents; and we were lucky when we found our whereabouts at last. We have twice had all we wanted in the way of squalls: once, as I came on deck, I found the green sea over the cockpit coamings and running down the companion like a brook to meet me; at that same moment the foresail sheet jammed and the captain had no knife; this was the only occasion on the cruise that ever I set a hand to a rope, but I worked like a Trojan, judging the possibility of haemorrhage better than the certainty of drowning. Another time I saw a rather singular thing: our whole ship's company as pale as paper from the captain to the cook; we had a black squall astern on the port side and a white squall ahead to starboard; the complication passed off innocuous, the black squall only fetching us with its tail, and the white one slewing off somewhere else. Twice we were a long while (days) in the close vicinity of hurricane weather, but again luck prevailed, and we saw none of it. These are dangers incident to these seas and small craft. What was an amazement, {{and at the same time}} a powerful stroke of luck, both our masts were rotten, and we found it out - I was going to say in time, but it was stranger and luckier than that. The head of the mainmast hung over so that hands were afraid to go to the helm; and less than three weeks before - I am not sure it was more than a fortnight - we had been nearly twelve hours beating off the lee shore of Eimeo (or Moorea, next island to Tahiti) in half a gale of wind with a violent head sea: she would neither tack nor wear once, and had to be boxed off with the mainsail - you can imagine what an ungodly show of kites we carried - and yet the mast stood. The very day after that, in the southern bight of Tahiti, we had a near squeak, the wind suddenly coming calm; the reefs were close in with, my eye! what a surf! The pilot thought we were gone, and the captain had a boat cleared, when a lucky squall came to our rescue. My wife, hearing the order given about the boats, remarked to my mother, 'Isn't that nice? We shall soon be ashore!' Thus does the female mind unconsciously skirt along the verge of eternity. Our voyage up here was most disastrous - calms, squalls, head sea, waterspouts of rain, hurricane weather all about, and we in the midst of the hurricane season, when even the hopeful builder and owner of the yacht had pronounced these seas unfit for her. We ran out of food, and were quite given up for lost in Honolulu: people had ceased to speak to Belle about the CASCO, as a deadly subject.|$|E
