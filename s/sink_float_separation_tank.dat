The {{current state of}} practice comprises four steps. Liquids from battery, gearboxes casing, brake fluid, coolant and air conditioning circuit are first collected. Tyres, catalysts, windscreens and windows are then manually removed, prior to the shredding of the car. A magnetic separation is processed on the shredded materials, to recover valuable ferrous components. The remaining part (Automotive Shredder Residue - ASR) undergoes successive separation steps, leading among others to two potentially valuable fractions, one mostly composed of plastics (P 1) and the other of iron oxides (P 2). Currently, P 2 and P 1 are respectively landfilled or used as a fuel source in various processes. In the blast furnace (BF) and the electric arc furnace (EAF) routes, P 1 {{could be used as}} substitute for coal or coke, and P 2 could replace part of the ore, provided some elements (Cl, Cu, Zn) are removed. Chlorinated compounds (PVC) can release toxics (dioxin) or corrosive metal chlorides, detrimental to the installations and the environment. Copper can spoil the cast-iron produced, and zinc favors the development of scabs that modify the flow configuration inside the BF. The whole objective of REFORBA is to assess the possibility of using "purified" fractions P 1 and P 2 in the BF and the EAF, as reducing agents or "iron ore". This would provide steelmakers with raw materials cheaper than coke. As additional potential benefits the amount of CO 2 generated in the processes and the volume of landfilled shredded residues would be lowered. Representative fractions of P 1 and P 2 are obtained by sampling an industrial line of treatment. Comprehensive chemical characterization (ICP-AES, SEM, FTIR, thermal analyses) is performed to know the global content and localization of materials containing chemicals to remove. Sorting operations (grinding, screening, magnetic, eddy current, and <b>sink</b> <b>float</b> <b>separations)</b> are then performed on P 1 and P 2, until the modeled BF global heat and flow profiles match the classical configuration. The possibility of using P 1 in place of C and CO is evaluated by a lab-scale thermochemical characterization of the iron oxides reduction, and {{of the quality of the}} cast-iron processed with some percent of P 2 in the ore feed. This will give estimations of P 1 and P 2 nominal contents to use in the BF, and assess the feasibility of a pilot-scale demonstration...|$|R
40|$|The Jameson cell is a {{relatively}} new flotation device that has been successfully used in several applications, ranging from mineral recovery to de-oiling dairy effluents. The cell comprises a plunging jet bubble column (downcomer) which discharges in a <b>separation</b> <b>tank.</b> The effect of operating variables on Jameson cell performance, e. g., gas holdup in the downcomer and interaction between the downcomer and <b>separation</b> <b>tank,</b> was investigated in this thesis. Gas holdup in the downcomer of the Jameson cell was determined using conductivity measurements with ring-shaped electrodes installed in the interior wall of the downcomer. The Maxwell model was used to calculate the gas holdup from the conductivity measurements. In both two-phase and three-phase tests, the conductivity signal was also shown to be able to detect process disturbances (e. g., changes in flow regime). Interaction between the downcomer and the <b>separation</b> <b>tank</b> was studied by altering the level in the <b>separation</b> <b>tank.</b> When gas flowrate was not controlled, the level affected the gas flowrate, pressure, pool level/free jet length, mixing zone length, and gas holdup in the downcomer. A pressure technique was used to determine the mixing zone length. The effect of the superficial gas velocity on the froth/pulp interface position in the <b>separation</b> <b>tank</b> was also studied. Although no relationship could be drawn between gas flowrate and <b>separation</b> <b>tank</b> level, froth flooding or loss of froth interface was observed at a superficial gas rate (with respect to the <b>separation</b> <b>tank)</b> $ ge$ 1. 2 cm/s...|$|R

50|$|Forced/Natural Circulation Evaporation is {{used when}} boiling of base liquids is undesired. It was {{developed}} specifically for processing and separation of liquids in which crystallising and scaling occurs. The evaporator uses separate parts {{to create the}} overall system; a heat exchanger, <b>separation</b> <b>tank</b> and for the forced circulation system (as opposed to the natural circulation system) a circulation pump are standard although can be subject to change depending on the liquids properties of the mixtures being separated and specific design. The units in the heat exchanger (where thermal transfer takes place) are called the heating units or calandria (for single tube heat exchangers). The liquid-vapor <b>separation</b> <b>tank</b> is called a flash separator, flash chamber or flash vessel.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} grade-eight students' conceptions of <b>sinking</b> and <b>floating.</b> Firstly, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 students to determine students’ difficulties and to develop a multiple-choice diagnostic test. In designing the content of the interview questions, grade-eight science curriculum, research on students' understanding of the subject, and primary school science teachers' views were taken into account. A diagnostic MCQ test was developed and administered to 108 students to determine the extent of the misconceptions revealed from the students' responses in the interviews. From the data, it was found that primary school students' misconceptions on <b>sinking</b> and <b>floating,</b> determined by earlier studies, were also held by grade-eight students in this study. In this paper, we have discussed the reasons that may lead to misconceptions and what should be done as science educators or teachers.

50|$|Most sample {{analysis}} is conducted after the experiment is quenched and {{removed from the}} multi-anvil. However, {{it is also possible}} to perform measurements in-situ. Circuits, including thermocouples or pressure variable resistors, can be built into the assembly to accurately measure temperature and pressure. Acoustic interferometry can be used to measure seismic velocities through a material or to infer density of materials. Resistivity can be measured by complex impedance spectroscopy. Magnetic properties can be measured using amplified nuclear magnetic resonance in specially configured multi-anvils. The DIA multi-anvil design often includes diamond or sapphire windows built into the tungsten anvils to allow x-rays or neutrons to penetrate into the sample. This type of device gives researchers at synchrotron and neutron spallation sources the capacity to perform diffraction experiments to measure the structure of samples under extreme conditions. This is essential for observing unquenchable phases of matter because they are kinetically and thermodynamically unstable at low temperatures and pressure. Viscosity and density of high-pressure melts can be measured in-situ using the <b>sink</b> <b>float</b> method and neutron tomography. In this method a sample is implanted with objects, such platinum spheres, that have different density and neutron scattering properties compared to the material surrounding them, and the path of the object is tracked as it <b>sinks,</b> or <b>floats,</b> through the melt. Two objects with contrasting buoyancy can be used simultaneously to calculate the density.|$|R
30|$|To better {{understand}} the role of hands-on experiences, we focused specifically on the physics domain of sinking objects. Inhelder and Piaget (1958) {{were among the first}} to look systematically at the development of people’s understanding of <b>sinking</b> and <b>floating.</b> They presented children with a series of everyday objects (e.g., utensils, tools, toys, materials) and asked them to decide whether they would <b>sink</b> or <b>float</b> in water. Since then, the range of tasks employed in this domain has expanded considerably. It includes making predictions about a single object (e.g., Kohn, 1993; Rappolt-Schlichtmann, Tenenbaum, Koepke, & Fischer, 2007; Skoumios, 2009; Unal, 2008), comparing pairs of objects (e.g., Castillo, Kloos, Richardson, & Waltzer, 2015; Kloos & Somerville, 2001; Penner & Klahr, 1996), and providing explicit explanations about predictions (e.g., Hsin & Wu, 2011; Meindertsma, 2014; Smith, Carey, & Wiser, 1985).|$|R
30|$|These {{findings}} {{have implications for}} reservoir souring management strategies (Nemati et al. 2001). For example, under conditions encountered in oilfields, where there is an abundance of electron donors, sulfate reduction to sulfide is more favorable than sulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur. Sulfide oxidation to intermediate sulfur species is, on the other hand, most problematic in oil/water topside <b>separation</b> <b>tanks</b> where nitrate levels are low. The occurrence and behaviour of these intermediate sulfur species {{and their impact on}} souring/scaling process need to be investigated for developing souring control strategies. This could be achieved through identifying the possible compounds involved and studying the thermodynamic and reaction rate data with respect to these species present.|$|R
