25|$|The next {{process is}} to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to {{strengthen}} the resulting <b>slubbing</b> such {{that it can be}} wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the <b>slubbing</b> is for double knitting yarn, the <b>slubbing</b> must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to build}} a computer-based system for measuring <b>slub</b> yarn characteristics and evaluating the results using statistical methods. The measuring system {{was based on the}} electrical condenser of the Uster evenness tester as a measuring sensor. A digital storage oscilloscope was used to convert the analogue output signals into digital data to be recorded on a computer. A designed computer program was constructed using MatLab language for signal analysis based on a proposed method. Final results from this system contained graphical plots for the three measured <b>slub</b> yarn geometrical parameters <b>slub</b> length, <b>slub</b> distance, and <b>slub</b> thickness and a final report for all the measured <b>slub</b> yarn characteristics. The results of tested <b>slub</b> yarn samples showed that actual <b>slub</b> geometrical parameters differ from nominal values and the difference had two level: prevailing difference and outlier values. Outliers which are considered <b>slub</b> yarn defects were detected and counted in a final report using the box plot statistical method which could be an effective industrial tool for evaluation of both yarn quality and machine performance. The prevailing difference was assessed using histogram comparison which could help in adjusting the setting of <b>slub</b> yarn device to obtain the required appearance...|$|R
40|$|Strength and {{elongation}} have a {{great effect}} on <b>slub</b> yarn performance in production and usage. The main {{aim of this study}} is to determine the statistically significant descriptive parameters that have an effect on the breaking force and elongation of <b>slub</b> yarn using the full factorial design method. In addition, the effects of the significant parameters on the breaking force and elongation were investigated. <b>Slub</b> yarn samples were produced by using a ring spinning frame on which an original <b>slub</b> attachment was designed and mounted. After the samples were produced, dimensional measurements and image analysis were made. Then quality tests were applied to all samples and the results analysed. As a re-sult, the parameters that have an effect on the breaking force of the <b>slub</b> yarn samples were obtained as the <b>slub</b> length, <b>slub</b> distance and base yarn count. The parameters affecting the breaking elongation of the <b>slub</b> yarn samples were obtained as the <b>slub</b> multiplier, base yarn count and twist coefficient. The relationship between the breaking force and elonga-tion and the parameters selected have been explained by statistically significant regression equations.

25|$|The machines, {{known as}} boxes, {{in the drawing}} section reduce the combed tops from thick slivers to thinner roving ready for spinning. This is done by {{drafting}} them between slow back rollers to faster front rollers, and controlling the fibres between these rollers. The first boxes where the ends are thickest are the double head can gill box (where the wool ends up in a can) and the 2-spindle gill box (where the wool ends up twisted and on spindles). On these machines the rollers are heavily fluted to control the sliver, and the front rollers padded with leather to cushion the wool. Between {{the front and back}} rollers are fallers or bars which control the roving by holding it with fine pins. The roving is now called <b>slubbing</b> which needs twist for strength, and is dealt with by a second set of boxes: a 2-spindle draw-box, 4-spindle weigh box, 8-spindle finisher/reducer and 8-spindle rover. In these boxes the principle of two sets of rollers with controlled fibre in between is the same, but the yarn is now twisted onto a bobbin via a flyer.|$|E

In addition, <b>slubs</b> do not compromise the integrity of the fabric, and therefore they are not viewed as a defect. However, the very finest linen has very consistent diameter threads, with no <b>slubs</b> at all.|$|R

50|$|The {{spinning}} jenny succeeded {{because it}} held {{more than one}} ball of yarn, making more yarn in a shorter time and reducing the overall cost. The spinning jenny {{would not have been}} such a success if the flying shuttle had not been invented and installed in textile factories. Its success was limited in that it required the rovings to be prepared on a wheel, and this was limited by the need to card by hand. It continued in common use in the cotton and fustian industry until about 1810. The spinning jenny was superseded by the spinning mule. The jenny was adapted for the process of <b>slubbing,</b> being the basis of the <b>Slubbing</b> Billy.|$|E

5000|$|The {{occurrence}} of many <b>slubs</b> in the yarn {{was well known}} to the weavers in the Hollins factory in Glasgow for they knew that much labor had to be spent after the weaving on “burling and mending” of the fabric in order to remove as many faults as possible. But in the spinning mill at Pleasley Vale yarn clearing was regarded as an undesirable and costly process. [...] The yarn production people in Pleasley believed that their <b>slub</b> catchers were effective - {{it was obvious to}} them that a <b>slub</b> up to an eighth in diameter could not pass through a slot only 10 thousandths of an inch wide. They never saw the evidence of their erroneous belief since they did not see the woven fabric with the many <b>slubs</b> that had passed through their yarn cleaners.|$|R
5000|$|In 1839 Hartmann {{fell out}} with Illing and founded {{the firm of}} [...] "Götze & Hartmann" [...] with August Götze, in which Götze was {{responsible}} for the commercial side and Hartmann for the technical aspects. In the same year Hartmann secured the rights to a <b>slubbing</b> frame (a type of wool spinning machine) for 1000 talers from a penniless inventor. This proved to {{be the beginning of a}} breakthrough for the company, which at that time numbered about 30 workers. These <b>slubbing</b> frames established Hartmann's reputation as a spinning machine producer beyond the Chemnitz area. In 1840 the growing company, which already had 76 employees, moved to new premises in Gablenz, but just a year later it outgrew those and the firm moved again to Chemnitz's Klostermühle. Its range of products had expanded in the meantime. In 1840 the firm delivered its first steam locomotive. In 1843 Richard Hartmann was awarded a gold medal for a new spinning machine. In 1844 Hartmann moved his company again and found new sheds at what later became Hartmannstrasse. At that time he employed about 350 workers. That year the company also set up its own iron foundry.|$|E
50|$|A {{breakthrough}} {{was made}} with the ring doffer, where the surface was covered by alternating continuous rings of clothing about an inch wide, separated by spacing rings of some material like leather. The idea seems to have originated with Louis Martin in Europe in 1803, {{and may have been}} used by Arnold Pawtucket in 1812 in Rhode Island. Ezekial Hale of Haverhill, Massachusetts patented the idea in 1825. With this design, it became possible to produce continuous lengths of <b>slubbing</b> to feed into the next stage.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of its closure in April 1981, Coldharbour Mill still had its textile {{machinery}} in position. The majority of these machines have been preserved (though not all are exhibited), and have been augmented with weaving machines rescued from the closure of the Tonedale site. The lowest part of the site, the level 1 combing shed, dealt with the initial cleaning and combing of the unwashed wool. The process involved a number of separate stages, each with a specialised machine. The eight opening gill machines (made by Taylor Wadsworth & Co)opened up the fleeces and prepared the wool for washing in a large back-washer with steam heated rollers. Following the washing, further gill boxes produced successively combed fibres, which were passed to a circular Noble combing machine. This machine separated the fibres into long [...] "Tops" [...] and the short poor quality fibres. Although these machines are preserved on site, they are no longer in use today. British wool tops are purchased in, dyed into standard colours, and then up to ten strands of tops are fed into the Intersecting Gill Box (manufactured by Prince Smith and Stells in 1959). The gill box starts the process of drawing out the fibres, and also enables new colours to be created by blending together the standard colours. The output of the gill box is termed a sliver. This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant. The next process is to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to strengthen the resulting <b>slubbing</b> such that it can be wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the <b>slubbing</b> is for double knitting yarn, the <b>slubbing</b> must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{commercial}} premises {{were built in}} Broomfields {{in the second half}} of the 19th century. In 1863 Ladywell Foundry was expanded and became Ladywell Mills. At the same time Globe Mills were built on the opposite side of Hall Lane close to Hall Lane Mills. All these mills were built for renting out on a room and power basis. Ladywell usually had three main tenants, each renting one of the three mill buildings. The 1912 Street directory lists the tenants as J&C Crabtree, Ltd commission wool comber, Ladywell <b>Slubbing</b> & Combing Co, and J.W Firth Ltd commission wool combers. Firths are still (2014) in occupation. At the same date Globe Mills had as tenants J & W Lister & Sons, worsted yarn spinners and the Bradford Steel Pin Manufacturing Co. Ltd. Later in the 20th century Globe mills was occupied by metal manufacturing and engineering companies - but no textile companies. The same directory states that Hall Lane Mills was solely occupied by W.H Wilkinson and Son, cabinet makers, who had occupied the premises since about 1880. Another [...] "Prospect Mill" [...] (in Usher Street) had also abandoned textiles and was occupied by Jas. Burroughs and Sons, wood-turners. Textile industries seemed not to flourish in Broom Fields so well as engineering and the furniture and timber trades. One of the biggest industrial sites in Broomfields in 1912 was the Prospect Saw Mills (founded 1811) - next to Prospect Foundry.|$|E
