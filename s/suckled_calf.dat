The herd included 23 Hereford cows ranging in age from 2 to 12 years and 14 Simmental-Hereford half-blood cows aged 3 to 9 years. The suckling calves were sired by Hereford bulls. The average daily milk yield of 6. 16 kg was affected by the cow breed. Simmental-Hereford cows produced 7. 11 kg of milk per day, while the Herefords produced 5. 21 kg per day. Milk production declined with increased days in lactation. The decline was linear in the Simmental- Hereford cows and quadratic in the Herefords. Milk production was also affected by the sex of the <b>suckling</b> <b>calf.</b> Heifer calves received 6. 44 kg per day compared t o 5. 80 kg per day for bull calves. Calf birth weight and test day weight influenced milk yield as cows nursing heavier calves produced more milk. Cow breed affected milk composition.

Bull calves weighed 33. 89 kg at birth, while heifers weighed 32. 14 kg. At weaning, bulls weighed 188. 63 kg, while heifers weighed 177. 14 kg.

40|$|The {{variability}} of onset of puberty, among and within breeds, {{has resulted in}} inconsistent reproductive performance of young bulls. To promote the successful use yearling bulls, {{it is very important}} to understand pubertal changes and factors that affect pubertal development. In the male <b>suckling</b> <b>calf</b> the seminiferous cords of the testes contain primordial germ cells and Sertoli cells that generate the seminiferous epithelium. A lumen is established in the seminiferous cords by about 5 mo of age and spermatogenesis is established by about 8 mo of age (1). An initial rise in FSH between 3 and 5 mo of age results in proliferation of Sertoli cells, seminiferous tubule lengthening and an increase in tubule diameter. At the same time, there is a rise in LH secretion resulting in increased testosterone production by the Leydig cells. Between 5 and 8 mo of age, FSH and LH remain low and then rise again with the onset of puberty. It has recently been shown that the greater the rise in LH at 3 to 5 mo of age, the earlier the onset of puberty and the larger that testis size will be at 1 y of age (2). In well-fed bulls testis growth is almost linear between 7 and 12 mo of age and scrotal circumference (SC) increases at a rate of 0. 06 – 0. 07 cm per day (3, 4). The rate of testis growth declines after 12 mo of age, but by 24 mo of age, the testes will be approximately 90 % of mature size (5). Onset of puberty has been defined as the first time when the ejaculate has at least 50 x 106 sperm/ml with at least 10 % having progressive motility (6).

40|$|Savanna {{elephants}} currently inhabit some of {{the hottest}} environments in Africa. Because of climate change, these environments are likely to get hotter. Due to their large body size and small body surface area to volume ratio, elephants may face difficulties in dissipating heat. Despite this suggestion, {{we do not understand}} how elephants in their natural environment respond to present day climatic extremes, which limits our ability to predict how elephants may respond to climate change. The goal of my study was to quantify behavioural responses of elephants to environmental temperature and to investigate the thermal benefits thereof. In so doing, I aimed to assess the potential consequences of environmental temperature on habitat selection and individual fitness, as well as their ability to adapt to climate change. I used continuous behavioural observations and ambulatory temperature recording devices to quantify and assess daytime behavioural responses to environmental temperature in seven tame, free-ranging savanna elephants in Botswana’s Okavango Delta. The elephants were unrestrained and free to roam in their natural environment. I found that environmental temperature {{played a significant role in}} dictating elephant behaviour within a day. At about 30 °C, elephants adjusted their behaviour aimed at reducing environmental heat loads and increasing heat dissipation (e. g. shade use, wetting behaviour). I further found that resting increased and feeding decreased with environmental temperature. Age was not a significant factor dictating elephant behaviour. However, the presence of a <b>suckling</b> <b>calf</b> influenced family group behaviour by increasing the probability of shade use and decreasing the probability of walking. The clear flexible ability of elephants to respond behaviourally to present day environmental temperatures is a promising observation in the face of climate change. However, I suggest that environmental temperature is likely a key determinant of habitat selection and space use in elephants that may have potential consequences for calf survival, sexual segregation and individual fitness. Further investigation of these consequences is warranted. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015. tm 2015 Zoology and EntomologyMScUnrestricte...|$|R

All calves were bottle-fed mother's colostrum once before first suckling occurred. Heifers' calves received a supplementary number of three such artificial meals, while cows' calves needed only one. The overall median time to first licking of the calf by the mother was 3. 3 min without any effect of parity. The mean licking frequency was 29. 2 +/- 15. 8 per 24 h: heifers licked their calf less frequently than cows, respectively 23. 4 +/- 15. 3 per 24 h versus 35. 1 +/- 14. 5 per 24 h (P< 0. 05).

40|$|In beef cows the {{interval}} from calving to first ovulation, or postpartum interval, {{is affected by}} nutrition and by the suckling effect of the <b>calf.</b> • The <b>suckling</b> effect is the biggest determinant of this interval, comprising: (i) physical contact and (ii) maternal bonding between cow and <b>calf.</b> Restricted <b>suckling</b> and <b>calf</b> isolation induce a rapid resumption of oestrous cycles. • Prepartum nutrition is the next most important determinant of the postpartum interval. Cows that calve in poor body condition have a longer interval than cows that calve in good body condition. • Increasing the level of nutrition in the postpartum period has only a limited effect in shortening the postpartum interval. • In most cows the first postpartum ovulation is silent and is succeeded by a short oestrous cycle of approximately 8 - 10 days. The first observed oestrus occurs prior to the second ovulation. • When used in combination with calf isolation and restricted suckling, progesterone pre-treatment for 6 days induces oestrus {{in the majority of}} cows and eliminates the short oestrous cycle. • The prolonged postpartum interval in beef cows is not due to failure of ovarian follicle development but to failure of successive dominant follicles to ovulate due to the inadequate frequency of LH pulses.

For successful beef production, the farmer must ensure his cows produce a calf every 12 months. One aspect of the research is to manipulate the cow/calf relationship to improve the conception rate. Researchers {{are looking at the}} delay in ovulation while a cow is <b>suckling</b> her <b>calf.</b> Either temporary weaning or the removal of the calf {{for two or three days}} at a time increases the onset of oestrus, particularly in Afrikaner cows, which are used for much of the breeding in Zimbabwe. Researchers are also looking at the endocrine profiles of a number of indigenous and exotic animals, in order to map out acceptable profiles and help explain fertility problems. Zimbabwe has an indigenous cattle breed called Mashona a highly productive and very fertile small cow. But in terms of production of beef for export, the Mashona presents drawbacks, mainly on account of its size. But exotic species like an Afrikaner cross are suitable breeds for export.
