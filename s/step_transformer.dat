40|$|Planar {{electromagnetic}} lenses {{like the}} Rotman lens are attractive candidates for beambeam forming networks forming networks {{because of their}} high bandwidth of operation and their capability to form multiple beams at lower cost as comparable electronic phase shifting networks. The principles of Rotman lenses have been studied for several decades and examples have been successfully built using different technologies, including parallel plate cavities fed by rectangular waveguides or microstrip lines on dielectric substrate. Due to the true time delay nature of Rotman lenses they theoretically exhibit extremely large bandwidth. However, lenses with rectangular waveguides as ports suffer from propagation of higher order modes inside the waveguide which limits the bandwidth to less than one octave in practical applications. Higher order waveguides, e. g. single or double ridged waveguides, allow for the propagation of a transversal electromagnetic (EM) mode and thus incorporate a larger bandwidth. But the symmetric nature of the TEM mode {{and the presence of}} the ridge complicate integration in the lens. The proposed paper outlines the design of a novel feed network based on higher order waveguides suited for multi- octave operation in Radar or Electronic Support Measures (ESM) applications. Each port includes coaxial feeding, a <b>step</b> <b>transformer</b> and a tapered section leading into the parallel plate section of the lens. An overview over the system will be given and numerical as well as experimental results on matching, insertion loss, mutual coupling and expected bandwidth obtained for a laboratory sample will be shown...|$|E
40|$|Geomagnetic {{disturbances}} {{that result}} from solar activities can affect technological systems such as power networks. They may cause DC currents in power networks and saturation of the core in power transformers that leads to destruction in the transformer performance. This phenomena result in unwanted influences on power transformers and the power system. Very asymmetric magnetization current, increasing losses and creation of hot spots in the core, in the windings, and the metallic structural parts are adverse effects that occur in transformers. Also, increasing demand of reactive power and malfunction of protective relays menaces the power network stability. Damages in large power transformers and blackouts in networks have occurred due to this phenomenon. Hence, studies regarding this subject have taken the attention of researchers during the last decades. However, a gap of a comprehensive analysis still remains. Thus, the main aim of this project is to reach to a deep understanding of the phenomena and {{to come up with}} a solution for a decrease of the undesired effects of GIC. Achieving this goal requires an improvement of the electromagnetic models of transformers which include a hysteresis model, numerical techniques, and transient analysis. In this project, a new algorithm for digital measurement of the magnetic materials is developed and implemented. It enhances the abilities of accurate measurements and an improved hysteresis model has been worked out. Also, a novel differential scalar hysteresis model is suggested that easily can be implemented in numerical methods. Two and three dimensional finite element models of various core types of power transformers are created to study the effect of DC magnetization on transformers. In order to enhance the numerical tools for analysis of low frequency transients related to power transformers and the network, a novel topological based time <b>step</b> <b>transformer</b> model has been outlined. The model can employ a detailed magnetic circuit and consider nonlinearity, hysteresis and eddy current effects of power transformers. Furthermore, the proposed model can be used in the design process of transformers and even extend other application such as analysis of electrical machines. The numerical and experimental studies in this project lead to understanding the mechanism that a geomantic disturbance affects power transformers and networks. The revealed results conclude with proposals for mitigation strategies against these phenomena. QC 20150210 </p...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{computer}} {{modeling of}} passive circular or rectangular waveguide components is often required during the design phase for optimizing frequency response and/or determining the tolerance required on components {{in order to}} meet radio frequency specifications. RWGSCAT/CWGSCAT is capable of modeling both types of waveguide components. The Scattering Matrix Program for Circular Waveguide Junctions, CWGSCAT, computes the scattering matrix for a circular waveguide. This includes a dual mode horn and certain types of corrugated horns. RWGSCAT, Rectangular WaveGuide junction SCATtering program, solves for the scattering properties of a rectangular waveguide device, such as a smooth or corrugated rectangular horn, <b>step</b> <b>transformer,</b> or filter. RWGSCAT and CWGSCAT are also available separately as NPO- 19091 and NPO- 18708, respectively. Many circular waveguide devices can be represented either exactly or approximately as a series of circular waveguide sections which have a common center. In addition, smooth tapers and horns of arbitrary profile may be approximated by a series of small steps. Devices that may be analyzed in this fashion include a simple waveguide step discontinuity, such as that used in a dual mode horn, a stepped matching section, or a corrugated waveguide section with constant varying slot depth. CWGSCAT will accurately predict the reflection and transmission characteristics of such devices, taking into account higher order mode excitation if it occurs as well as multiple reflections and stored energy at each discontinuity. For large devices, with respect to a wavelength where many modes may propagate, the reflection and transmission properties may be required for a higher order mode or series of modes exciting the device. Such interactions are represented best by defining a scattering matrix for the device. The matrix can be determined by using mode matching at each discontinuity present. The results for individual discontinuities are then cascaded to get the matrix for the entire device. Frequently, rectangular waveguide components may be represented either exactly or approximately as a number of different size rectangular waveguides which are connected in series. RWGSCAT will model such devices and accurately predict the reflection and transmission characteristics, taking into account higher order (other than dominant TE 10) mode excitation if it occurs, as well as multiple reflections and stored energy at each discontinuity. For devices which are large with respect to the wavelength of operation, the characteristics of the device may be required for computing a higher order mode or a number of higher order modes exciting the device. Such interactions can be represented by defining a scattering matrix for each discontinuity in the device, and then cascading the individual scattering matrices {{in order to determine the}} scattering matrix for the overall device. The individual matrices are obtained using the mode matching method. RWGSCAT and CWGSCAT are written in FORTRAN 77 for IBM PC series and compatible computers running MS-DOS. They have been successfully compiled and implemented using Lahey FORTRAN 77 under MS-DOS. Sample MS-DOS executables and sample input data files are provided on the distribution media. RWGSCAT requires 377 K of RAM for execution. CWGSCAT requires 355 K of RAM for execution. The standard distribution medium for this program is a set of two 5. 25 inch 360 K MS-DOS format diskettes. The contents of the diskettes are compressed using the PKWARE archiving tools. The utility to unarchive the files, PKUNZIP. EXE, is included. An electronic copy of the documentation is included on the distribution medium in LaTEX format. RWGSCAT was developed in 1993. CWGSCAT was developed in 1987, and this version was released in 1991.

This system was developed into the modern 3-phase system by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky and Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft and Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown in Europe, starting in 1889. The simplicity of polyphase generators and motors meant that besides their efficiency they could be manufactured cheaply, compactly and would require little attention to maintain. Simple economics would drive the expensive, balky and mechanically complex DC dynamos to their ultimate extinction.
