40|$|The extreme {{variation}} {{in the amount of}} annual precipitation and rainfall during single events is typical of the East Asian monsoon climate and may greatly influence the characteristics of the <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load.</b> The turbidity in Lake Imha which is the eighth largest multipurpose dam in Korea has been the cause of major water quality problems for use as drinking water. The turbidity rose to 882 NTU, and it remained over 30 NTU continuously for 170 days during 2002, as the result of significant amounts of soil erosion from the watershed during the Asian monsoon typhoon. In this study, characteristics of <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate was investigated by comparing the variation of yearly <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> and the ratio of maximum <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> in a single event to yearly <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> from Lake Imha watershed using the Hydrologic Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF). The model calibration is performed according to the 2009 – 2010 events, and simulation results characterized <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate for 2001 – 2010. Water sampling and flow rate measurements were performed every 4 – 6 h, and calibration was performed using hourly simulated sediment loads. The calibration results demonstrated good agreement with the observed data. The characteristics of <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate are a high variance of the yearly <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> and a significant of amount of <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> during a single event influenced by the typhoon intensity.

The aims of this work are (1) to determine what is the critical <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> needed {{in order to maintain the}} land balance of the Yellow River Delta for two periods before and after 1976 (the last time the channel shifted), and (2) to examine the variation in the channel geometry and gradient in response to changes in <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> and delta area at the river mouth. In order to estimate these critical values, we used statistical method to analyze the relationships between land area increment, and <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> and channel geometry. In order to examine the variation in the channel geometry, the channel cross-sections of the Q 1 and Q 6 were compared. The results show that to maintain the land area balance between 1953 and 1973, when the river mouth was the Diaokouhe, the critical annual <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> entering the delta was 4. 21 * 10 (8) tonnes/a. After the main channel switched to Qingshuigou in 1976, the critical value to maintain the Qingshuigou mouth between 1976 and 1997 was 1. 51 * 10 (8) tonnes/a. To maintain the land area balance for the entire Yellow River Delta between 1976 and 1997 the critical <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> was 3. 18 * 10 (8) tonnes/a. The annual mean channel thalweg elevation and channel gradient at the fiver delta increase with increasing land area increment at the Qingshuigou mouth. The critical channel gradient at the channel reach between cross sections Q 1 and Q 6 is 0. 000095. The channel has narrowed during the time period from 1976 to 1997. Also, lateral channel migration has decreased remarkably, resulting in enhanced hydraulic efficiency of the deltaic channel and artificial levees. This channel geometry evolution was influenced by river adjustment and human activities. These results are of importance for the management of the lower Yellow River channel and the delta.

Rates of aggradation during floods are several {{orders of magnitude}} larger than the time-averaged rate.

40|$|A catchment-scale {{framework}} {{was developed}} to assess the contribution of sediment sources from farm management actions, gully and streambank erosion on the <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> delivered to rivers and associated wetlands and floodplains for two catchments (Avon Richardson, 2885 square km and Avoca, 4550 square km) in Victoria, south-eastern Australia. After considering commonly available data sets, outputs from the point-scale model (HowLeaky 2008) were coupled to a catchment scale framework (CatchMODS). Spatially constant, linear scaling factors were used to link point-scale water surplus to streamflow and gross soil loss to hillslope erosion. The model was calibrated against discharge and <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> estimated at water quality monitoring gauging stations. Following calibration, estimates of annual and monthly streamflow and 10 -year average annual sediment loads were in good agreement with observations. Catchment-scale outputs, particularly sediment loads, were sensitive to scaling factors. The high sensitivity coupled with limited data hindered tight identification of sediment scaling parameters, therefore sediment outputs were uncertain, particularly in the Avoca catchment. Propagation of uncertainty in parameter estimation to model estimates was assessed qualitatively. The boundaries of model estimations were assessed by retaining predictions of behavioural parameter sets, defined as parameter sets that resulted in efficiencies of sediment load and specific sediment yield estimations not more than 5 % lower than {{the efficiency of the}} optimal parameter set. Under current management conditions, mean annual <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> at the Avon-Richardson catchment outlet was estimated to be 3350 (3300 - 3700) t y - 1, of which hillslope erosion contributed 65 % (60 - 80 %) and gully erosion 35 % (20 - 40 %). In the Avoca catchment, annual <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> was estimated to be 4000 (3500 - 5100) t y - 1, of which hillslope erosion contributed 17 % (5 - 24 %), gully erosion 72 % (55 - 93 %), and streambank erosion 11 % (1 - 21 %). In the Avon-Richardson catchment management scenarios showed that alternative farming systems focussed on retaining vegetation cover throughout the year would yield a 50 per cent reduction of <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load,</b> estimated at 1700 t y - 1. In contrast, fencing and revegetation of connected gullies was estimated to yield the largest reduction in <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> (1770 t y - 1, 44 % of current load) in the Avoca catchment. The framework provides an improved tool to make more informed decisions about how much <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> can be reduced in response to farm management actions, gully and streambank protection. Its primary strength lies in the ability to propagate farm management impacts to the catchment scale. Other valuable features for use by natural resource management agencies include a high level of transparency, availability of user-friendly interfaces, and a modular structure that provides flexibility and adaptability to new systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{processing of}} measured concentrations of <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> in three hydrological stations {{on the river}} Drava, Croatia. Measurement data were available for discrete moments during 17 -year period (1990 - 2007) in gauging stations Botovo, Terezino polje, and Donji Miholjac. The data were provided by the National hydrometeorological Institute (DHMZ), which carried out the sampling and initial calculations of concentration. Data processing includes only ¨profile ¨ measurements where sediment sampling was done on several verticals and at several depths of the discharge profile. Data processing shows adjustment of the theoretical curve of distribution of concentration of values measured at each station. Mathematical concentrations used in further processing were obtained by excluding outliers in measured data. Further, the paper shows the dependence water surface elevation- discharge, as well as discharge- <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> concentration in the stations, and interdependence of sediment concentrations between the three stations for small, medium and high water flows. Based on the resulting dependence of concentrations between the stations, the estimate is given of concentration of <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> in the downstream station Belisce. Finally, based on the estimated discharge- sediment concentration dependence on gauging station Donji Miholjac, estimate is given of total annual <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> for the period 990 – 2007...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Sediment-discharge {{rating curve}} {{is well known}} method in {{predicting}} <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> discharge. The correlation is usually developed as a relationship between <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> and discharge. Ideally, the measured of discharge and sediment concentration are carried out continuously, as <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> is more depended on the sources, i. e. the erosion rate on the catchment rather than the river hydraulic. In practice, the discharge and sediment concentration are carried out intermittently or in spot, as it is time and cost consuming. Therefore, the use of sediment-discharge rating curve to predict <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> may generate an error. This study is stressed to evaluate the accuracy of sediment-discharge rating curve in predicting <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment.</b> The estimated sediment was compared to measured reservoir sedimenation. Sediment was estimated based on various sediment-discharge rating curves. The result showed that the present sediment-discharge rating curve (year 2002) produced a higher sediment reservoir estimation than that was measured. By using continue daily discharge the error was less than using the daily discharge from average three point measurement. The different varies from 13. 53...|$|R

The Dee estuary, located in the eastern Irish Sea, is 20 km long, 8 km wide at the mouth and {{is characterized by a}} 10 m tidal range. <b>Suspended</b> and seabed <b>sediments</b> in the Dee contain a diverse assemblage of non-cohesive and cohesive sediments, and therefore the threshold of motion at the bed could be a complex process, dependent on several factors.

Human activities included methods of agricultural policy, i. e. land use and management practices. Finland started to follow EU&# 39;s agricultural policy in 1995. In this study our main objective was {{to find out whether}} the original targets of the Finnish Agri-Environmental Programme (FAEP) were achieved. We analyzed trends in discharge, water quality and climate parameters in 37 years long time-series in two catchments. We focused on the <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> and phosphorus concentrations and loads, the main interests to FAEP. We found an increasing trend in mean annual temperature, especially in spring and late summer-early autumn. There was no statistical significant change in annual runoff. Increasing winter runoff in the other catchment could be explained by the increased number of days when temperature was above zero degrees making snowmelt possible. In this area high potential sediment delivery occurred in early winter. FAEP succeeded in decreasing the <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> by reduced tillage and wintertime vegetation cover. In controlling the phosphorus loads FAEP succeeded only in the catchment with erosion sensitive soils. In the catchment where soils were less sensitive for erosion increase in the dissolved reactive phosphorus load exceeded the benefits of the reduced particulate phosphorus load. Climate change may increase the <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>load</b> by increasing winter runoff. Even then, instead of decreasing the <b>suspended</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>loads</b> FAEP should rather focus on dissolved nutrients as they cause eutrophication in receiving waters...|$|R
