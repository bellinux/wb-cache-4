After an infusion at knee and elbow joints, there has been made a tissue receipt from the <b>synovial</b> <b>layer</b> of these joints, and a study of them at the electron microscope within a predetermined time difference. The findings of this research mainly underline the stable characteristics of a normal <b>synovial</b> <b>layer.</b> In these are included a relatively normal cellular limb with numerous microvillus processes, plenty rough endoplasmatic reticulum in a regular order of petaloid, clear-sighted Golgi structures, plenty cytoplasmic glycogen, normal mitochondria, moderately big cores with a slight variation in size and shape, minimum inwards plications of the nuclear membrane, loose chromatin with a small accretion, isolated nucleus and lack of a mitotic activity. Chondrocells tended to be dispread in a somehow loose, amorphous foundation substance. Moreover, we have to mention that cells in the hyaline cartilage’s nodules showed the ultramicroscopic characteristics of a typical mature cartilage. Very close to the nodule’s cartilages were observed areas of numerous cells, resembling fibroblasts within the intracellular substance, which was rich in rough cartilage. Some areas included cells with an intermediate modification between chondrocells and fibroblasts - prolongated cells with good shaped Golgi complexes. ...|$|E

40|$|Immunohistochemical {{study showed}} {{selective}} localisation of human {{epidermal growth factor}} (hEGF) to the <b>synovial</b> lining <b>layer.</b> Although the <b>synovial</b> lining <b>layer</b> of the rheumatoid, osteoarthritic, and traumatic joints was hEGF positive, hEGF staining was especially dense at the rheumatoid synovial lining layer; the staining increasing linearly according {{to the degree of}} stratification of the lining layer (r = 1). Human epidermal growth factor was ultrastructurally localised to cytoplasm, especially to rough endoplasmic reticulum, of the synovial lining fibroblast-like (type B) cell. Only the cell surface of macrophage-like (type A) cells was hEGF positive. When different histological variables were compared with each other a positive correlation was found between hEGF staining of the <b>synovial</b> lining <b>layer</b> and the degree of neovascularisation of rheumatoid synovium (r = 0. 72). Although some lymphocytes were weakly hEGF positive, neovascularisation did not correlate with the extent of lymphocyte infiltration or of hEGF staining of lymphocytes. Lymphocyte infiltration or hEGF staining of lymphocytes did not correlate with hEGF staining of the <b>synovial</b> lining <b>layer,</b> whereas the lymphocyte infiltration correlated positively with the extent of perivascular accumulation of lymphocytes (r = 0. 89). These findings suggest that (a) hEGF is synthesised by and secreted through endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus from the synovial lining type B cell; (b) hEGF is at least partially responsible for the pathogenesis of stratification of the rheumatoid <b>synovial</b> lining <b>layer,</b> and perhaps of neovascularisation of the rheumatoid synovium, whereas it is not responsible for lymphocyte accumulation to the rheumatoid synovium...|$|R

40|$|Developmental {{anomalies}} of {{the long}} head of the biceps tendon are rare and have been described in the literature mainly dealing with anatomy and embryology.

These data were compared with the scarce case descriptions of developmental anomalies {{of the long}} head of the biceps tendon. An additional case illustration from our own experience was provided. From the literature, it appears that during the embryologic phase of development, a staged migration of the long head of the biceps tendon occurs from a position between the fibrous capsule and <b>synovial</b> <b>layer</b> to an intraarticular position.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo study whether {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) in {{the knee}} {{is associated with a}} change of the innervation pattern in the <b>synovial</b> <b>layer.</b> DesignIn synovial tissue from the normal knee joint of rat and sheep we studied the presence of vessels and of nerve fibres using transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Synovial material was also obtained from patients who underwent total knee replacement surgery. This material was examined for inflammatory changes, and the presence of vessels and nerve fibres was assessed. ResultsThe synovium in the parapatellar region of the normal knee joint of rat and sheep exhibited a dense capillary and neuronal network. It was entered by calcitonin gene-related peptide containing sensory fibres and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive sympathetic nerve fibres. Synovial material from patients with knee OA exhibited different degrees of inflammation. Synovial material without inflammation exhibited a similar vascular and neuronal network as the normal knee joint from rat and sheep. However, in synovium with inflammatory changes we found a significant decrease of nerve fibres in depth ranges close to the synovial lining layer depending on the degree of inflammation whereas deeper regions were less affected. ConclusionsInflammatory changes in the synovium of OA joints are associated with a massive destruction of the capillary and neuronal network which is present in normal synovium. Due to the disappearance of the sensory fibres it is unlikely that OA pain is initiated directly in the synovium. The loss of normally innervated vascularisation may have multiple consequences for the physiological functions of the synovium...|$|E
40|$|The healthy <b>synovial</b> lining <b>layer</b> {{consists}} of a single cell layer that regulates the transport between the joint cavity and the surrounding tissue. It {{has been suggested that}} abnormalities such as somatic mutations in the p 53 tumor-suppressor gene contribute to synovial hyperplasia and invasion in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study, expression of epithelial markers on healthy and diseased synovial lining tissue was examined. In addition, we investigated whether a regulated process, resembling epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) /fibrosis, could be responsible for the altered phenotype of the <b>synovial</b> lining <b>layer</b> in RA. <b>Synovial</b> tissue from healthy subjects and RA patients was obtained during arthroscopy. To detect signs of EMT, expression of E-cadherin (epithelial marker), collagen type IV (indicator of the presence of a basement membrane) and α-smooth muscle actin (α-sma; a myofibroblast marker) was investigated on frozen tissue sections using immunohistochemistry. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) from healthy subjects were isolated and subjected to stimulation with synovial fluid (SF) from two RA patients and to transforming growth factor (TGF) -β. To detect whether EMT/fibrotic markers were increased, expression of collagen type I, α-sma and telopeptide lysylhydroxylase (TLH) was measured by real time PCR. Expression of E-cadherin and collagen type IV was found in healthy and arthritic synovial tissue. Expression of α-sma was only found in the <b>synovial</b> lining <b>layer</b> of RA patients. Stimulation of healthy FLSs with SF resulted in an upregulation of α-sma and TLH mRNA. Collagen type I and TLH mRNA were upregulated after stimulation with TGF-β. Addition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) - 7 to healthy FLS stimulated with SF inhibited the expression of α-sma mRNA. The finding that E-cadherin and collagen type IV are expressed in the lining layer of healthy and arthritic synovium indicates that these lining cells display an epithelial-like phenotype. In addition, the presence of α-sma in the <b>synovial</b> lining <b>layer</b> of RA patients and induction of fibrotic markers in healthy FLSs by SF from RA patients indicate that a regulated process comparable to EMT might cause the alteration in phenotype of RA FLSs.

Objectives: To assess the presence and biological potential of mesehchymal stem cells in three tissues (subchondral bone, <b>synovial</b> <b>layer,</b> periarticular adipose tissue) in late stages osteoarthritic patients. Material and Methods: Samples were collected from subjects undergoing total knee replacement (TKR). MSCs were isolated and cultured in complete αMEM with β FGF. Cell morphology and growth potential was assessed. Flow cytometry was used for detection of several relevant cell surface markers. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of differentiation potential towards three mesenchymal lineages (osteogenesis adipogenesis chondrogenesis) was performed. Time lapse life cell imaging of nondiferentiated cells over 24 hours period {{was used to determine}} cell kinetics. Results: Mesenchymal cells derived from all donors and tissue types showed morphology, growth and surface cell markers associated with stemness. All cell types underwent differentiation toward three mesenchymal lineages with significant differences between tissues of origin, not between donors.

40|$|The fibrous {{components}} of the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint including the palmar plate, the collateral ligament and the dorsal plate were studied with particular attention paid to the fibrous structure of the fibrous tendon sheath and the deep transverse metacarpal ligament. The tough fibrillar structure around the MP joint, especially the force nucleus, consisted of three types of mixed fibers: the fibrous tendon sheath of the A 1 pulley, the deep transverse metacarpal ligament, and the palmar plate. The tendon sheath was located on the ulnar side in the index and middle fingers, on the central position in the ring finger, and on the radial side in the little finger.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this paper}} was to examine the {{macroscopic}} and microscopic characteristics of the paratendineous tissues (paratenon, epitenon and endotenon) of the calcaneal tendon to better understand their role in the pathogenesis of "tendinopathy". Ten non-embalmed legs from cadavers were used. Histological and immunohistochemical studies were done at the middle third of the tendon. Magnetic resonance images of the hind foot were made in 60 living subjects to analyze the morphological alterations of tendon and paratenon. The paratenon is a thick fibrous layer with few elastic fibers, continuous with the crural fascia, well vascularized and innervated. It forms a sheath around the tendon similar to a <b>synovial</b> <b>layer,</b> but less organized. Indeed, it has no complete epithelium, but only some cells producing hyaluronan, called fasciacytes. Crural fascia and paratenon can be clearly observed by MRI, appearing as homogeneous, low signal intensity bands, sharply defined in the context of subcutaneous tissue in T 1 -weighted sequences. The mean thickness of the crural fascia was 1. 11 mm in healthy subjects and 1. 30 mm in patients (p < 0. 005). The mean value of paratenon thickness in patients was 1. 34 mm, 0. 85 in healthy (p < 0. 0001). The paratenon is more highly vascularized and innervated than the tendon, supporting the hypothesis that it is the origin of pain in tendinopathy. The imaging study suggests that, an increase in the thickness of the paratenon more than 1. 35 mm is predictive of paratendinopathy, even before tendon damage...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that osteoarthritis (OA) is induced by mechanical stress followed by cartilage destruction, and it is generally accepted that there is little involvement of an immune response in OA compared with that in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We have previously found clonally expanded transcripts of Vβ chain of the T cell receptor (TCR) in the synovium of patients with OA. To test the hypothesis that an immune response is involved in OA, we determined: (a) whether CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + T-cells were infiltrating the synovial membrane of patients with OA; (b) the Th 1 /Th 2 -type cytokines produced at the protein level in the synovium of patients with OA. Methods Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to identify T-cells that infiltrated the synovium of patients with OA using specific antibodies against CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + T-cell differential antigens, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ as a marker for Th 1 cells, and interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) as a marker for Th 2 cells. Results CD 4 + T-cells were strongly detected in the sublining layer of the synovium of patients with OA compared with the number detected in the same <b>synovial</b> <b>layer</b> of normal subjects. The number of IFN-γ+ cells was significantly higher than that of IL- 4 + cells in the synovium of patients with OA (P< 0. 05). Conclusions These observations suggest that Th 1 cells predominate in the synovium of patients with OA, which clearly indicates that immune regulation occurs and may play critical roles in inflammation and cartilage destruction in patients with OA...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although the {{efficacy}} of standard fish oil {{has been the subject}} of research in arthritis, the effect of krill oil in this disease has yet to be investigated. The objective of the present study was to evaluate a standardised preparation of krill oil and fish oil in an animal model for arthritis. Methods: Collagen-induced arthritis susceptible DBA/ 1 mice were provided ad libitum access to a control diet or diets supplemented with either krill oil or fish oil throughout the study. There were 14 mice in each of the 3 treatment groups. The level of EPA + DHA was 0. 44 g/ 100 g in the krill oil diet and 0. 47 g/ 100 g in the fish oil diet. Severity of arthritis was determined using a clinical scoring system. Arthritis joints were analysed by histopathology and graded. Serum samples were obtained at the end of the study and the levels of IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL- 7, IL- 10, IL- 12 p 70, IL- 13, IL- 15, IL- 17 and TGF-β were determined by a Luminex™ assay system. Results: Consumption of krill oil and supplemented diet significantly reduced the arthritis scores and hind paw swelling when compared to a control diet not supplemented with EPA and DHA. However, the arthritis score during the late phase of the study was only significantly reduced after krill oil administration. Furthermore, mice fed the krill oil diet demonstrated lower infiltration of inflammatory cells into the joint and <b>synovial</b> <b>layer</b> hyperplasia, when compared to control. Inclusion of fish oil and krill oil in the diets led to a significant reduction in hyperplasia and total histology score. Krill oil did not modulate the levels of serum cytokines whereas consumption of fish oil increased the levels of IL- 1 α and IL- 13. Conclusions: The study suggests that krill oil may be a useful intervention strategy against the clinical and histopathological signs of inflammatory arthritis...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{simultaneously}} assessed ultrasonography (US) {{and magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) in comparison with histopathological changes in the knee joints of long-lasting arthritis patients. METHODS: We studied 15 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 5 patients with osteoarthritis, who underwent total knee arthroplasty. On the day before surgery, the joints were examined by US and contrast-enhanced MRI. In US, synovitis was graded with 0 – 3 grey scale (GSUS) and power Doppler (PDUS). In MRI, synovitis was graded according to OMERACT-RAMRIS (grade 0 – 3). Synovial tissue samples were obtained during arthroplasty and evaluated {{on the basis of}} inflammatory cell infiltrates (grade 0 – 3), <b>synovial</b> lining <b>layer</b> thickness (grade 0 – 3) and vascularity (grade 0 – 3). RESULTS: Positive findings of PDUS and contrast-enhanced MRI were 45 % and 85 % of 20 operated joints, respectively. GSUS, PDUS and MRI synovitis were well correlated with overall histopathological grades of synovitis (Spearman correlation coefficients 0. 48, 0. 84 and 0. 48, p< 0. 05, p< 0. 01 and p< 0. 05, respectively). Moreover, positive PDUS findings were closely associated with all pathological comportments of synovitis including inflammatory cell infiltrates, <b>synovial</b> lining <b>layer</b> thickness and vascularity. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that positive PDUS findings more faithfully illustrated active synovitis than MRI, whereas contrast-enhanced MRI was more sensitive in detecting synovitis in patients with long-lasting arthritis. It is important to understand distinct features of the both modalities for clinical assessment of chronic joint diseases...|$|R

A correlation between both the intensity of <b>synovial</b> lining <b>layer</b> thickening and mononuclear cell infiltration and the clinical status {{at the time of}} biopsy was seen.

40|$|The current gold {{standard}} for {{the reconstruction of the}} human anterior cruciate ligament are autografts. Those autografts are associated with high donor-site morbidity. To avoid this disadvantage, a xenogenic collagen implant was developed in the laboratory of Meike Haddad-Weber at the University of Wuerzburg. This study presents a systematic histological analysis of the healing as well as osseous integration of the ligament in the minipig model. Methods: Xenogenic implants were prepared from rat collagen and used in minipigs as anterior cruciate ligament replacement. Fixation of the implants was achieved via Endobutton. The animals were sacrificed at six weeks and six months post operation, respectively. 13 minipigs were used for histological analysis. Paraffin-embedded sections of the implants as well as paraffin- and plastic-embedded sections of the Ossa femura were prepared and evaluated descriptively by transmitted light microscopy. Furthermore, immunohistological staining for collagen I and factor-VIII-related antigen was performed with semi-quantitative assessment of the factor-VIII-related antigen staining. Results: In the six-week group (n= 7) all samples were well vascularized, covered by a <b>synovial</b> <b>layer</b> and vital. Early ligament remodeling was observed. An interface fibrous layer and Sharpey’s fibers had formed in all samples. Moreover, in all samples first signs of direct ligament insertion were found. In the six-month group (n= 6) the number of vessels had increased and the original implant tissue could not be detected anymore. Newly formed reticulated bone constricted the drill channel and in none of the samples an interface fibrous layer was detectable. In this group, five out of six samples showed signs of a direct ligament insertion. No signs of synovialitis were found. Discussion: The course of the revascularization and ligament remodeling as well as ligament healing corresponds to the results obtained with autografts described in the literature. Furthermore, the detection of pig collagen I in the preparations verifies the complete integration of the implants. In summary, it appears that the implant used in this study integrates completely and without inflammation, and is substituted by ligament tissue of the recipient. Further studies have to show if this is a suitable method for cranial cruciate ligament reconstruction in humans...|$|E
30|$|The {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee joint is frequently ruptured and may often require reconstruction with autologous tendon grafts to treat chronic knee instability (Beynnon et al. 2005; Woo et al. 2006). The clinical and functional outcome of ACL reconstruction is generally satisfactory, allowing {{the majority of the}} patient population to return to work and a part to return to pre-injury level sports activity. However, ACL reconstruction does not fully restore the function of the intact ACL. Additionally, there are several drawbacks (Busam et al. 2008; Drogset et al. 2010; von Porat et al. 2004). Though, it is commonly believed that the ACL does not have a healing response and cannot heal, some researchers are re-exploring methods to repair the ACL in the acute phase (Fisher et al. 2012; Fleming et al. 2009; Murray et al. 2007; Nguyen et al. 2013; Kohl et al. 2013). In a previous study, our research group reported that the treatment of the transected ACL with a new suture repair technique in combination with the small intestinal submucosa (SIS) bioscaffold lead to healing in a goat model (Nguyen et al. 2013). The ACLs in both experimental groups were healing and continuous. Biomechanical testing showed that the repaired ACLs contributed to the knee function (Nguyen et al. 2013). The total AP translation of the repaired ACL was 290 % to 440 % of the intact control under 67  N anterior and posterior tibial load (AP load). The normalized stiffness of the healing ACLs was about half of the control ACLs. The ACLs were retained for this study with the aim to histologically investigate whether the healing ACL has histologically characteristics as the healing medial collateral ligament (MCL). The comparison with the MCL was made as the MCL is regarded as the knee ligament that has a healing response and that can heal spontaneously. As such, the first research question of this study was whether the ACLs treated with the triple X suture alone or combined with small intestine submucosa (SIS) resemble the histological healing characteristics as observed in the healing MCL. Secondly, does the combined treatment with SIS leads to improved histological healing characteristics, in terms of the morphology of the fibrous <b>synovial</b> <b>layer,</b> the extracellular matrix (ECM), collagen fiber orientation, cellularity, ratio of myofibroblasts over total cell count, and collagen type 3 staining. These parameters provide a general evaluation of the healing process in ligaments. Myofibroblasts have shown {{to play an important role}} in the healing and remodeling of MCL, with an initial increase in density after injury and steadily normalization during the remodeling phase. Myofibroblasts have also been shown in the injured but non-healing ACL, though the density remained low (< 1.5 %) (Menetrey et al. 2011). SIS bioscaffold is mainly composed of collagen type 1 and contains endogenous growth factors such as fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and TGF-β, as well as other chemoattractants which enhances the healing (Hodde et al. 1996; Hodde et al. 2005; Voytik-Harbin et al. 1997). Several studies have shown that SIS can act as a provisional scaffold to promote cell migration and to enhance revascularization and repair (Gilbert et al. 2007; Liang et al. 2008; Zantop et al. 2006; Liang et al. 2011; Raeder et al. 2002). It was thus hypothesized that SIS enhances the healing of the ACL and that the SIS-treated ACL is closer to the normal ACL histologically, i.c. compacter ECM, less voids, more cells, less myofibroblasts and less collagen type 3 staining.|$|E

Immunohistological staining of MMP- 2, MMP- 14 and TIMP- 2 localized to corresponding areas in the <b>synovial</b> lining <b>layer</b> and was almost absent in normal synovium.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{determine}} the synovial mast cell response in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during clinical improvement, {{and to examine}} for relations with clinical and histological parameters of disease activity.  METHODS—Twenty two synovial samples were obtained from six patients with RA using needle arthroscopy. The mean disease duration at baseline was eight months, and two to three further samples were obtained over a mean follow up period of 15  months during which treatment initiated clinical improvement occurred. Sections were immunostained to detect MCT and MCTC mast cells and correlations were sought between clinical and histological data.  RESULTS—The overall mean synovial mast cell density was 40. 3  cells/mm 2, with regional densities of 60. 6  and 34. 2  mast cells/mm 2 in the superficial and deeper <b>synovial</b> <b>layers</b> respectively. The MCT subset predominated, outnumbering MCTC by 3 : 1. There was a significant correlation between the histological inflammation index and the MCT density, (r =  0. 4, p <  0. 05) but not the MCTC subset. The regional distribution and predominant subset of mast cells varied in individual patient's synovia over time, with a trend towards restriction of the mast cell response to the superficial synovium during clinical improvement.  CONCLUSIONS—The mast cell response in early RA is characterised by substantial expansion of predominantly MCT mast cells that correlates with histological indices of inflammation. During clinical improvement, this expansion tended to become more superficial. Taken together with previous studies of long duration RA, which implicate MCTC cells in synovial damage and disease progression, {{these results suggest that}} MCT and MCTC mast cells may possess distinct functions in the spectrum of inflammatory events occurring during RA. ...|$|R
