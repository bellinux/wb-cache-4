25|$|In 1972, Hal Varian {{suggested}} that the law {{could be used to}} detect possible fraud in lists of <b>socio-economic</b> <b>data</b> submitted in support of public planning decisions. Based on the plausible assumption that people who make up figures tend to distribute their digits fairly uniformly, a simple comparison of first-digit frequency distribution from the data with the expected distribution according to Benford's Law ought to show up any anomalous results. Following this idea, Mark Nigrini showed that Benford's Law could be used in forensic accounting and auditing as an indicator of accounting and expenses fraud. In practice, applications of Benford's Law for fraud detection routinely use more than the first digit.|$|E

40|$|The Wales Institute of <b>Socio-Economic</b> Research, <b>Data</b> and Methods (WISERD) is an interdisciplinary, cross-institutional {{academic}} research {{group based in}} Wales, UK. One of the key objectives of WISERD {{is to develop a}} spatial framework that enhances a researcher's ability to discover <b>socio-economic</b> research <b>data</b> relating to Wales with the aim of encouraging collaborative research and re-use of existing data. This article describes the development of an online geoportal designed to meet this objective. Using free and open-source software (FOSS) components and services, a range of software tools has been developed to capture standards-compliant metadata for a variety of data sources. The geoportal is unique in that, in our review of over 120 geoportals worldwide, we have not previously encountered a geoportal dedicated to supporting quantitative and qualitative social science academic and policy research. A particularly innovative aspect of the geoportal has involved the building of a rich meta-database of government surveys, geo-referenced semantically-tagged qualitative data (generated from primary research), ‘grey’ data (e. g. from transcripts, journal publications, books, PhD theses) and Government administrative data. This article describes the challenges faced during the development of the WISERD Geoportal which can be accessed via [URL]...|$|R
