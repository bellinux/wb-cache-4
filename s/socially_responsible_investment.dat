40|$|Institutional {{investors are}} {{increasing}} their ownership in corporations and therefore {{their influence on}} financial markets is expanding. The Swedish public pension funds are one of Sweden’s largest institutional investors, holding capital for pension savers that amount to 1 123 billion Swedish Kronor. Media and non-governmental organizations’ attention on institutional investors’ corporate engagement have put pressure on their work with <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investments.</b> The Swedish public pension funds are no exception. Recent reports reveal that the pension funds are still owners in fossil fuel intensive corporations as well as firms connected with human rights violations. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify factors that influence pension funds’ view on <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investments.</b> Particular focus is directed towards the funds’ view on corporations that are highly involved in fossil fuel emissions. The study is presented as a case study in which a comparison of management between two of Sweden´s public pension funds is made in order to define how the attitude towards <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investments</b> affect the choices of instruments of influence that are used in corporate engagement. The findings of the study argue that the two funds use similar instruments of influence in their corporate engagement. However, differences in how the instruments are applied exist and the study reveals that the two funds’ approaches to corporations that are highly involved in fossil fuel emissions are different. Conclusions from the study are that the funds’ work with <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investments</b> is based on the mandate to serve the Swedish citizens and manage their retirement money in a desirable way. The study argues that the funds’ view on <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investments</b> is based on their role as representatives for the majority of individuals in Sweden and that the funds actions, consequently, should reflect the majority opinion of the Swedish society...|$|R

We observe significant unidirectional volatility transmissions from conventional to sustainable equities, suggesting that the criteria applied for <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investments</b> do not necessarily shield these securities from common market shocks. While significant dynamic correlations are observed between sustainable and conventional stocks, particularly in Europe, the analysis of both in- and out-of-sample dynamic portfolios suggests that supplementing conventional stock portfolios with sustainable counterparts improves the risk/return profile of stock portfolios in all regions. The findings overall suggest that sustainable investments can indeed provide diversification gains for conventional stock portfolios globally...|$|R

It appears that the financial performance of {{the various types of}} <b>socially</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investments</b> differs considerably. We construct a proxy for mutual funds' CSR policies and use information about the environmental and social impact of activities financed by "green" financial institutions. We find preliminary evidence that financial and CSR performance substantially differs per category of financial instrument analysed. In the Netherlands, tax policy significantly affects financial results and the government can affect the CSR impact of some financial instruments too. More coherent and consistent information about CSR is required to establish whether financial and social performance interact.
