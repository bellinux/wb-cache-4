5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany in November 1918, {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet's ships, {{under the}} command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Cöln was among the ships interned. On the voyage there, her captain radioed the fleet commander that one of the ship's steam turbines had a leaking condenser. Reuter dispatched another light cruiser to remain with the ship in the event that <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> towed. Despite the problematic turbine, Cöln managed to steam into port, the last ship in the German line.|$|E
5|$|At about eleven o'clock, Cox began urging Ashford to leave. When the two did leave, it {{was with}} Thornton, who {{accompanied}} Ashford closely, while Cox walked behind them. Instead of returning to Erdington, Ashford announced that {{she would go to}} her grandfather's house, stating that it was closer to work. This was true, but ignored the fact {{that she would have to}} return to Erdington to obtain her working clothes in the morning. Cox journeyed to Erdington, while Ashford and Thornton went off together. At about a quarter to three, a labourer saw Thornton leaving a friend's house with a woman, and greeted Thornton, but the woman (undoubtedly Ashford) held her bonnet over her face. Just before 4a.m., Cox was awakened by Ashford, seeking her working clothes. Ashford changed and hurried off, stating that <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> home before her uncle left for market. A returning reveller from Tyburn House saw her walking quickly. He was the last person known to see her alive.|$|E

25|$|Springer's move to {{her home}} waters needed to be well timed to {{maximize}} her chances of re-integrating into a wild pod.

She did not disclose what her vote would be on the Syrian war, but said that it was an important decision and one which <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there for.|$|E
500|$|The {{repercussions of}} the {{euthanasia}} for Dot's character {{have been described}} as [...] "extremely serious" [...] as she suffered from [...] "untold guilt and felt that <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> punished for the action." [...] The Executive Producer overseeing this storyline, John Yorke, has discussed the storyline in a speech given at the Bishops' Conference for clergy and other ministers in the Diocese of St Albans: [...] "Dot, as a good Christian, refused to help, until her love for her friend overcame her own fear of damnation. Riddled with an intolerable burden of guilt, she felt there was only one person she could talk to [...] The Dot and Ethel storyline played out in over four months with many similar scenes, to an average audience of 16 million viewers. Dot [...] explored the full panoply of religious belief before coming back to terms with her maker. When Alan Bookbinder took over as head of religious broadcasting at the BBC he described EastEnders for the weeks the Dot and Ethel story ran as 'the best religious programme on television' and compared [...] to Graham Greene. While we felt a little uncomfortable in such exalted company, what it did show is that handled properly an audience is able to engage in, and relate to profound ethical debate." ...|$|E

500|$|New {{cast members}} include Ian McShane, {{who plays the}} notorious pirate and primary {{antagonist}} of the film, Blackbeard, and Penélope Cruz, who plays Angelica, Jack Sparrow's love interest. According to Marshall, McShane was chosen because [...] "he can play something evil but there's always humor behind it as well" [...] and the actor accepted the job due to both the [...] "very funny and charming" [...] script {{and the opportunity to}} work with Marshall. The beard took one {{hour and a half to}} get applied, and McShane likened the character's costume to [...] "a real biker pirate—it's all black leather.” Marshall said Cruz was the only actress considered for the role, as she fit the description as [...] "an actress who could not only go toe to toe with Johnny and match him, but also needed to be all the things that Jack Sparrow is in a way. <b>She</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> funny and clever and smart and crafty and beautiful", and invited her for the role as they wrapped the production of Nine. The actress spent two months working out and learning fencing for the role. During filming, Cruz discovered she was pregnant, leading the costume department to redesign her wardrobe to be more elastic, and the producers to hire her sister Mónica Cruz to double for Penélope in risky scenes. Depp recommended Stephen Graham, who worked with him in Public Enemies, to play Scrum, a Machiavellian pirate and sidekick to Jack Sparrow, and Richard Griffiths for the role of King George II, as Depp was a fan of Griffiths' work on Withnail and I. Sam Claflin, a recent drama school graduate with television experience, was chosen to play the missionary Philip, and British actor Paul Bazely also joined the cast. Spanish news website El Pais reported that the film had four Spanish actors: Cruz, Bergès-Frisbey, Óscar Jaenada, and Juan Carlos Vellido. Jaenada was picked for both his work in The Losers and a recommendation by Cruz.|$|E

2500|$|In 1949, despite {{protests from}} the medical establishment, the Portuguese {{neurologist}} António Egas Moniz received the Physiology or Medicine Prize for his development of the prefrontal leucotomy, which he promoted by declaring the procedure's success just 10 days postoperative. Due largely to the publicity surrounding the award, it was prescribed without regard for modern medical ethics. Favorable results were reported by such publications as The New York Times. [...] It is estimated that around 40,000 lobotomies were performed in the United States before the procedure's popularity faded. Joseph Kennedy, the father of John Kennedy, subjected his daughter, Rosemary, to the procedure which incapacitated her {{to the degree that}} <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> institutionalized {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E

Private cabins were available at £1 extra and refreshments were available on board.

2500|$|Krassovska feuded with {{management}} regularly, raising {{the possibility of}} a sudden promotion for Tallchief. [...] She nearly quit the company late in 1942 and Tallchief was told she would go on in her place. [...] Krassovska was persuaded to return, but the incident made it clear to Tallchief <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ready to perform Krassovska's technically difficult role on short notice– something for which she was not yet ready. In the spring of 1943, Krassovska argued with Denham and left the company. [...] "Unprepared, I was numb with terror," [...] Tallchief recalled. When the company returned to New York, Tallchief received positive reviews. The New York Times dance critic John Martin wrote [...] "Tallchief gave a stunning account of herself in Nijinkska's Chopin Concerto... She has an easy brilliance that smacks of authority rather than bravura", and predicted she would be a big star in the near future. Glory, however, was short lived as Tallchief returned to the corps when the staging of Chopin Concerto was complete.|$|E
