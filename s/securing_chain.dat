50|$|The harbour at Llanelly was {{prone to}} silting, and as {{the output of the}} Great Mountain Colliery {{increased}} in the 1890s this became a serious constraint, much output being diverted to Swansea. In 1892 and again in 1895 the reclaimed spit of land leading to the light tower was breached by the sea, further reducing the utility of the rail access to the harbour facilities. In 1896 the Harbour Commissioners obtained Parliamentary powers to extend and improve the harbour by the construction of a North Dock. The shipping entrance to the dock was to be {{at the point where the}} L&MMR passed along the waterfront. Work did not start promptly, and in fact it was not until 1899 that it started. The work immediately interfered with the L&MMR operation, the track being undermined at the site of construction. Peaceful negotiation having failed, the L&MMR secured wagons to their track at the point of construction, but the Harbour Commissioners’ contractor struck off the <b>securing</b> <b>chain</b> and removed the obstruction. The matter was eventually resolved in the High Court, where the finding went in favour of the L&MMR.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{issue in the}} design of <b>secure</b> supply <b>chains</b> is the understanding of the relation between supply chains and the organizational responsibility of specific parts of these supply chains. Organizational boundaries change over time by means of vertical and/or horizontal (des) -integration and so do the related organizational responsibilities. This paper provides an overview of possible intra- and inter-decoupling points in supply chain organizational responsibilities. All these decoupling positions will have implications on establishing supply chain security. Several reference models were explored and assessed on there usability to identify supply chain organizational relationships. Finally an extension on The Balanced Scorecard was proposed as reference model to identify <b>secure</b> supply <b>chains</b> organizational responsibility issues.

Therefore, in forensic use of digital evidence {{it is necessary to}} carefully check that the probative force of the evidence is sufficient.

This paper introduces the notion of <b>secure</b> digital <b>chains</b> of evidence and proposes a high-level architecture for systems that can provide such chains of evidence. Finally, possible building blocks are explored for the realisation of a distributed and heterogeneous system with support for <b>secure</b> digital <b>chains</b> of evidence...|$|R

50|$|Legal specialists {{say that}} the U.S. {{government}} is unlikely to allow a trial in the Iraqi courts, because there is little confidence that trials would be fair. Contractors accused of crimes abroad could be tried in the United States under either military or civilian law; however, the applicable military law, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, was changed in 2006, and appears to now exempt State Department contractors that provide security escorts for a civilian agency. Prosecution under civilian law would be through the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, which allows the extension of federal law to civilians supporting military operations; however, according to the deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's criminal division, Robert Litt, trying a criminal case in federal court would require a <b>secure</b> <b>chain</b> of evidence, with police securing the crime scene immediately, while evidence gathered by Iraqi investigators would be regarded as suspect.|$|R
