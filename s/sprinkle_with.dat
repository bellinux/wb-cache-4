The first three deities refuse, saying Inannas fate is her own fault, but Enki is deeply troubled and agrees to help.

5000|$|Snorri's Gylfaginning gives a prose {{explanation}} and a variant form of these stanzas. Brodeur's translation renders:A witch dwells {{to the east}} of Midgard, in the forest called Ironwood: in that wood dwell the troll-women, who are known as Ironwood-Women Iárnvidjur. The old witch bears many giants for sons, and all in the shape of wolves; and from this source are these wolves sprung. The saying runs thus: from this race shall come one that shall be mightiest of all, he that is named Moon-Hound Mánagarm; he shall be filled with the flesh of all those men that die, and he shall swallow the moon, and <b>sprinkle</b> <b>with</b> blood the heavens and all the lair; thereof-shall the sun lose her shining, and the winds in that day shall be unquiet and roar on every side. So it says in Völuspá:Eastward dwells the Old One in Ironwood,And there gives birth to Fenrir's brethren;There shall spring of them all a certain one,The moon's taker in troll's likeness.He is filled with flesh of fey men.Reddens the gods' seats with ruddy blood-gouts;Swart becomes sunshine in summers after,The weather all shifty.
