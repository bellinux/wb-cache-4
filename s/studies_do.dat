5|$|Czech mycologist Josef Šutara {{circumscribed}} {{the genus}} Mariaella in 1987, assigning Mariaella bovina as the type species. Mariaella contained Suillus species in section Fungosi. Molecular <b>studies</b> <b>do</b> {{not support the}} existence of Mariaella, {{and so it is}} considered synonymous with Suillus. Older synonyms for S.bovinus include those resulting from generic transfers to Agaricus by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1783, and the now-obsolete Ixocomus by Lucien Quélet in 1888.|$|E
5|$|Early on, Lull {{postulated}} that the frills may {{have served as}} anchor points for the jaw muscles to aid chewing by allowing increased size and thus power for the muscles. This has been put forward by other authors over the years, but later <b>studies</b> <b>do</b> not find evidence of large muscle attachments on the frill bones.|$|E
5|$|While the {{previous}} grouping had good morphological support, molecular <b>studies</b> <b>do</b> not corroborate the monophyly of this group. Previously Mysida included two other families, Lepidomysidae and Stygiomysidae, but these {{have now been}} placed in a separate order, Stygiomysida.|$|E

According to <b>studies</b> <b>done</b> on university students in KSA, higher headache prevalence (92 %) was reported from a <b>study</b> <b>done</b> on female university students at Taibah University (2015) [19].|$|R

5|$|TCDD was {{classified}} in 1997 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a carcinogen for humans (group 1). In the occupational cohort studies {{available for the}} classification, the risk, even at very high exposures, was weak and borderline detectable. Therefore, human data were not deemed sufficient, and the classification was, in essence, based on animal experiments and mechanistic considerations. This has been criticized as a deviation from IARC classification rules. It is much debated whether TCDD is carcinogenic only at high doses which also cause toxic damage of tissues. Moreover, a recent review concludes that, after 1997, further <b>studies</b> <b>do</b> not support an association between TCDD exposure and cancer risk. New studies include the update of Vietnam veteran studies from Ranch Hand operation, which concluded that after 30 years the results do not provide evidence of disease.|$|E

30|$|For {{migraine}} prevalence, {{a higher}} prevalence {{was reported in}} previous Saudi <b>studies</b> <b>done</b> on university students of King Faisal University (58.4 %) [7] and Taibah University (61.8 %) [19]. The lower prevalence found in our study (32.5 %) {{could be explained by}} the fact that we only describe a 3 -month prevalence. In the same time, lower migraine prevalence was reported from other <b>studies</b> <b>done</b> on university students in other Arab and foreign countries [10, 21], and in a <b>study</b> <b>done</b> in KSA [17].|$|R

25|$|Intersex can be {{contrasted with}} {{homosexuality}} or same-sex attraction. Numerous {{studies have shown}} higher rates of same sex attraction in intersex people, with a recent Australian study of people born with atypical sex characteristics finding that 52% of respondents were non-heterosexual, thus research on intersex subjects {{has been used to}} explore means of preventing homosexuality. However, current <b>studies</b> <b>do</b> not support a statistical correlation between genetic intersex traits and transsexual persons.|$|E

25|$|In the past, some {{research}} suggested that geographic tongue {{was associated with}} diabetes, seborrheic dermatitis and atopy, however newer research does not corroborate these findings. Others suggest allergy as a major factor, e.g. to nickel sulphate. Some studies have reported a link between geographic tongue and psoriasis, although 90% {{of children who are}} diagnosed with geographic tongue do not develop psoriasis. Again however, modern research <b>studies</b> <b>do</b> not support any link between psoriasis and geographic tongue. Lesions that are histologically indistinguishable from geographic tongue may also be diagnosed in reactive arthritis (arthritis, uveitis/conjunctivitis and urethritis).|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of deception {{has been challenged}} by some psychologists who maintain that deception under any circumstances is unethical, and that other research strategies (e.g., role-playing) should be used instead. Unfortunately, {{research has shown that}} role-playing <b>studies</b> <b>do</b> not produce the same results as deception studies and this has cast doubt on their validity. In addition to deception, experimenters have at times put people into potentially uncomfortable or embarrassing situations (e.g., the Milgram experiment and Stanford prison experiment), and this has also been criticized for ethical reasons.|$|E
25|$|With {{global demand}} for {{biofuels}} {{on the increase}} due to the oil price increases taking place since 2003 {{and the desire to}} reduce oil dependency as well as reduce GHG emissions from transportation, there is also fear of the potential destruction of natural habitats by being converted into farmland. Environmental groups have raised concerns about this trade-off for several years, but now the debate reached a global scale due to the 2007–2008 world food price crisis. On the other hand, several <b>studies</b> <b>do</b> show that biofuel production can be significantly increased without increased acreage. Therefore, stating that the crisis in hand relies on the food scarcity.|$|E

25|$|Prospective {{epidemiological}} <b>studies</b> <b>do</b> {{not support}} the hypotheses that comorbidity of substance use disorders with other psychiatric illnesses is primarily a consequence of substance abuse or dependence or that increasing comorbidity is largely attributable to increasing use of substances. Yet emphasis is often {{on the effects of}} substances on the brain creating the impression that dual disorders are a natural consequence of these substances. However addictive drugs or exposure to gambling will not lead to addictive behaviors or drug dependence in most individuals but only in vulnerable ones, although, according to some researchers, neuroadaptation or regulation of neuronal plasticity, and molecular changes, may alter gene expression in some cases and subsequently lead to substance use disorders.|$|E
25|$|The National Academy of Sciences {{released}} a report in 2004 supporting the use of clinical studies under strict regulations; the regulations mandated that the study's benefit to society outweigh the risk to the individual, that the study be conducted under a strict ethical code, that there be reasonable certainty that no harm will come to participants {{and that it has}} been shown that no other study will work. In 2005, adhering to a congressional directive, the EPA adopted the Human Studies Regulation; the regulations permit human <b>studies,</b> <b>do</b> not allow the use of pregnant women or children in human studies, mandate that a strict ethical code be followed and establish a Human Studies Review Board to oversee the use of human studies. The EPA considers the regulations as a major accomplishment in public policy.|$|E
25|$|NMR {{involves}} the quantum mechanical {{properties of the}} central core ("nucleus") of the atom. These properties depend on the local molecular environment, and their measurement provides a map of how the atoms are linked chemically, how close they are in space, and how rapidly they move with respect to each other. These properties are fundamentally {{the same as those}} used in the more familiar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the molecular applications use a somewhat different approach, appropriate to the change of scale from millimeters (of interest to radiologists) to nanometers (bonded atoms are typically a fraction of a nanometer apart), a factor of a million. This change of scale requires much higher sensitivity of detection and stability for long term measurement. In contrast to MRI, structural biology <b>studies</b> <b>do</b> not directly generate an image, but rely on complex computer calculations to generate three-dimensional molecular models.|$|E

25|$|VEP {{testing of}} acuity is {{somewhat}} similar to preferential looking in using {{a series of}} black and white stripes (sine wave gratings) or checkerboard patterns (which produce larger responses than stripes). Behavioral responses are not required and brain waves created by the presentation of the patterns are recorded instead. The patterns become finer and finer until the evoked brain wave just disappears, which is considered to be the endpoint measure of visual acuity. In adults and older, verbal children capable of paying attention and following instructions, the endpoint provided by the VEP corresponds very well to the psychophysical measure in the standard measurement (i.e. the perceptual endpoint determined by asking the subject when they can no longer see the pattern). There is an assumption that this correspondence also applies to much younger children and infants, though this does not necessarily have to be the case. <b>Studies</b> <b>do</b> show the evoked brain waves, as well as derived acuities, are very adult-like by one year of age.|$|E
25|$|Many tumors express {{mutations}}. These mutations potentially {{create new}} targetable antigens (neoantigens) {{for use in}} T cell immunotherapy. The presence of CD8+ T cells in cancer lesions, as identified using RNA sequencing data, is higher in tumors with a high mutational burden. The level of transcripts associated with cytolytic activity of natural killer cells and T cells positively correlates with mutational load in many human tumors. In non–small cell lung cancer patients treated with lambrolizumab, mutational load shows a strong correlation with clinical response. In melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, long-term benefit is also associated with a higher mutational load, although less significantly. The predicted MHC binding neoantigens in patients with a long-term clinical benefit were enriched {{for a series of}} tetrapeptide motifs that were not found in tumors of patients with no or minimal clinical benefit. However, human neoantigens identified in other <b>studies</b> <b>do</b> not show the bias toward tetrapeptide signatures.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} has established {{the existence of}} primary progressive apraxia of speech caused by neuroanatomic motor atrophy. For a long time, this disorder was not distinguished from other motor speech disorders such as dysarthria and in particular primary progressive aphasia. Many {{studies have been done}} trying to identify areas in the brain in which this particular disorder occurs or at least to show that it occurs in different areas of the brain than other disorders. One study observed 37 patients with neurodegenerative speech disorders {{to determine whether or not}} it is distinguishable from other disorders, and if so where in the brain it can be found. Using speech and language, neurological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging testing, the researchers came to the conclusion that PAS does exist and that it correlates to superior lateral premotor and supplementary motor atrophy. However, because PAS is such a rare and recently discovered disorder, many <b>studies</b> <b>do</b> not have enough subjects to observe to make data entirely conclusive.|$|E
