40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} the usage of high viscosity polymeric hydrogels in varnish removal on paper objects, for conservation purposes. Varnishing paper artefacts was a common practice between the 18 th and 20 th century. However, the procedure has resulted in degradation and discoloration of paper artefacts, which usually results in the removal of the varnish by conservators. The study aims to investigate the solvent-based poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and borate gel as an alternative for removing shellac varnish on paper artefacts. Different solvent-based gels are frequently used in fine arts conservation but are not commonly used in paper conservation. Traditional conservation methods with <b>solvent</b> <b>baths</b> may have negative consequences in terms on the effect on the paper substrate. The hydrogel PVA-borax will be compared to traditional <b>solvent</b> <b>baths</b> commonly used in paper conservation. The study includes a disciplinary literature study of PVA-borax usage for cleaning works of art and the historical usage of varnish on paper objects. Artificial aging of shellac samples are carried out in order to provide sufficient materials and samples for analysis. The chosen analysis methods are Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Ultraviolet (UV) Fluorescence imaging, which both can be used to indicate the presence of shellac residues left after removal. The FTIR analysis shows that PVA-borax is an insufficient substrate for removal of varnish on paper samples due to the low percentage of solvents of the total moisture content carried out in the gel. However, a case study on a varnished wall map shows that PVA-borax gel sufficiently removes aged varnish from the paper substrate. Further studies are needed to analyse the gels sufficiency as a varnish removal agent on paper substrates.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cross-linked polymer networks, {{irrespective}} of the method of cross-linking, contain a fraction of unattached polymer (sol macromolecules). During swelling in a solvent of low molecular weight, the sol macromolecules participate in the swelling process as an athermal solvent. Also, sol macromolecules begin to diffuse out of the swollen polymer into the surrounding <b>solvent</b> <b>bath</b> until equilibrium is reached between the sol macromolecules within the polymer specimen and the molecules in the surrounding bath. Thus, a partially cross-linked polymer during swelling {{should be treated as}} a ternary system consisting of polymer network, a high molecular weight solvent, and a low molecular weight solvent. On the basis of the Flory-Rehner theory, a first model has been developed to predict the swelling behavior of such ternary system. Transient states are considered as quasi-steady state, and the final condition of equilibrium is evaluated. The effect of polymer molecules in the surrounding <b>solvent</b> <b>bath</b> on the swelling behavior was also studied. Swelling experiments of partially cross-linked high-density polyethylene in p-xylene were performed to evaluate the model predictions. The presence of sol macromolecules within the swollen gel increased the swelling while sol molecules in the surrounding bath decreased the swelling of the partially cross-linked polymer...|$|E

40|$|Our {{research}} {{is centered on}} creating synthetic fibers with our spider silk proteins (MaSp 1 /MaSp 2) incorporated into them. This is done through two processes; Electrospinning and Wet Spinning. A liquid dope is created using our two proteins and different solvents. The first process for creating synthetic fibers is using our electrospinning instrument, in which our dope is placed into a syringe and a positive electrode is attached to it while the target (rotating spindle or stationary target) has the negative electrode attached. The flow rate, spindle rotation, and current (approximately 28 kV) can {{vary depending on the}} desired situation. Once all three parameters have been chosen, the voltage ejects the dope at an incredibly quick rate inducing nanofiber formation on the spindle, which can then be collected and rolled into tough fibers. The second method is that of wet spinning, in which the dope is ejected into a solution of either water, IPA, or methanol. As the fiber forms within the liquid it is then taken and placed onto Godets, a system which allows for different rates of stretch within different <b>solvent</b> <b>baths.</b> Both techniques are used to combine our 2 proteins with different fibers such as nylon, with the potential to increase the fibers mechanical properties...|$|R

Novel here are the abnormally high coagulation <b>bath</b> <b>solvent</b> compositions investigated, which surpass those often reported in the literature. In addition, the coagulation bath was maintained at a slightly chilled temperature, contrary to reported methods to produce round fibers. Further, by altering the composition of the bath in a step-wise fashion during a single spinning run, variations in all other process parameters were minimized. We found that with increasing solvent composition in the coagulation bath, the fibers not only became round in cross section, but also became smaller in diameter, which persisted down the spin line. With this decrease in diameter, all else equal, came an accompanying increase in apparent fiber density via a reduction in microvoid content. In addition, molecular orientation and tensile properties also increased. Therefore, it was found that inadequate understanding of the coagulation bath effects, and spinning at low coagulation <b>bath</b> <b>solvent</b> compositions, can hinder the ability of the fiber to reach optimum properties...|$|R

The distance-dependent pair diffusion coefficient describes the hydrodynamic interactions between particles in a fluid that are central to theories of polymer and colloid dynamics.

At distances exceeding 3 molecular diameters, the calculated pair diffusion coefficients are in excellent agreement with predictions from exact macroscopic hydrodynamic theory for large Brownian particles suspended in a <b>solvent</b> <b>bath,</b> as well as the Oseen approximation. However, the asymptotic 1 /r distance dependence of D(r) associated with hydrodynamic effects emerges only after the pair distance dynamics has been followed for relatively long times, indicating non-negligible memory effects in the pair diffusion at short times. Deviations of the calculated D(r) from the hydrodynamic models at short distances r reflect the underlying many-body fluid structure, and are found to be correlated to differences in the local available volume.

30|$|To date, {{a series}} of methods have been {{developed}} to produce graphene, such as micromechanical cleavage [7], reduction of graphene oxide [8, 9], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [10], and liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) [11 – 14]. Micromechanical cleavage can be used to prepare high-quality large-area GNPs but has the disadvantages of low production yield and poor throughput. Reduction of graphene oxide is widely used to produce GNPs; however, the reduction process does not remove all of the oxygen functional groups. Thus, the GNPs produced by reduction of graphene oxide still retain a high defect density, which degrades their properties. CVD is a promising method for large-scale production of monolayer or few-layer graphene with high quality; however, the method requires harsh chemical reaction conditions, such as high temperature and vacuum, which may increase the costs and cause safety problems.

Continual development of new membrane materials is crucial to sustain and expand the growing interest in this technology and modern polymer chemistry is highly proficient in tailoring polymers with desired properties such as increased mechanical, thermal and chemical stability. Cellulose acetate (CA) is one of the membrane polymers that has been used for aqueous based separation and used as both reverses osmosis (RO) and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes. This paper presents investigation of influence of casting machine speed in membrane preparation. CA is used in this study. That was CA- 398 - 30 with average acetyl content 39. 8 wt %. Non solvent used is water and the solvent is 99. 7 % organic Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO). The homogenous CA/DMSO solutions were prepared by dissolving CA in DMSO solvent. The CA concentration were varied 13 and 16 % while casting solution speed were varied from 20 to 80 mm/sec with distance cutting machine were fixed at 14 cm. In addition, non <b>solvent</b> in coagulation <b>bath</b> also were varied by 100 % water and 10 % DMSO in water. The results of this experiment describe effect of casting machine speed to water permeability. The effect of CA concentration to water permeability shows the adversative result between 13 and 16 % CA in 100 non solvent water. The similar result also observed in 10 % DMSO in water...|$|R
