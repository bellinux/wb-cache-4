5|$|While in Kuwait, Manning {{was placed}} on suicide watch after her {{behavior}} caused concern. She was moved from Kuwait to the Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, on July 29, 2010, and classified as a maximum custody detainee with Prevention of Injury (POI) status. POI status is one <b>stop</b> <b>short</b> of suicide watch, entailing checks by guards every five minutes. Her lawyer, David Coombs, a former military attorney, said Manning {{was not allowed to}} sleep between 5 am (7 am on weekends) and 8 pm, and was made to stand or sit up if she tried to. She was required to remain visible at all times, including at night, which entailed no access to sheets, no pillow except one built into her mattress, and a blanket designed not to be shredded. Manning complained that she regarded it as pretrial punishment.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September, U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke and U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter W. Galbraith {{met with}} Croatian President Franjo Tuđman in Zagreb. Holbrooke was {{directed}} by the United States to urge Tuđman to stop offensive operations by the HV in western Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, Holbrooke and Galbraith thought the instructions unwise and saw the opportunity to defeat the VRS and establish a new military balance in the country. Holbrooke also considered that the changing {{situation on the ground}} allowed him and Galbraith to ignore the instructions. Holbrooke urged Tuđman to capture Sanski Most, Novi Grad and Prijedor from the VRS, and to do so quickly, but asked him to <b>stop</b> <b>short</b> of capturing Banja Luka. Holbrooke and Galbraith considered it would be advantageous for them and that justice would be served if the VRS lost Banja Luka, but decided against encouraging it, fearing there would be another 200,000 refugees from the city or that Croatia would not be willing to relinquish control of Banja Luka later on. They were also hoping that more moderate Bosnian Serb leadership might be found in the city, as it was the most urban Bosnian Serb area.|$|E

25|$|The canal had {{originally}} been planned to <b>stop</b> <b>short</b> of central Glasgow, to avoid descending to the lower level there; a causeway was authorised, envisaging horse and cart haulage to the city, {{but it was not}} built. In 1786 when the completion of the canal was being proposed, the idea was repeated; however it was never carried out.|$|E
25|$|When a train {{stopped at}} a red stop signal, its {{presence}} on the track started a time delay relay. At {{the conclusion of the}} time delay, the red marker light was extinguished and replaced by the miniature yellow (the upper red aspect remained lit). The train stop also lowered. The calling on aspect authorised the driver to proceed, but to be prepared to <b>stop</b> <b>short</b> of another train.|$|E
25|$|In addition, resorts may ban {{individuals}} who have broken the rules, but either <b>stop</b> <b>short</b> of a criminal offense, or would not be worth the effort to involve law enforcement.

25|$|The reviews did, however, <b>stop</b> <b>short</b> of proclaiming {{it one of}} Ayckbourn's best plays. In {{spite of}} the praise for Susie Blake, the Financial Times review felt the twists were {{familiar}} when they came, and the characters' inflexions becoming tedious. Dominic Cavendish for the Daily Telegraph, although broadly positive of the play itself, criticise Ayckbourn for allowing the Stephen Joseph Theatre's programme {{to be dominated by}} his work.|$|E

Poems, {{such as the one}} where he sent an urgent demand that his beloved return if he wished the speaker to remain faithful to him, have been interpreted to indicate that more than poetic invention was involved.|$|E
25|$|Rafał A. Ziemkiewicz. In the 1990s {{he was one}} of {{the most}} popular Polish science fiction authors. For his novels Pieprzony los kataryniarza (1995) and Walc stulecia (1998), as well as his short story Śpiąca królewna (1996) he was awarded the prestigious Zajdel Award. A popular theme in his works is the fate of Poland and more broadly, Europe, in the near future (from several to several dozen years). His books often paint the future in dark colours, showing the Commonwealth of Independent States {{disintegrate}} into a civil war, European Union becoming powerless in the face of Islamic terrorism, and predatory capitalism and political correctness taken ad absurdum leading to the erosion of morality and ethics. Thus his books are often classified as political fiction and social science fiction, although they <b>stop</b> <b>short</b> of being seen as dystopian fiction.|$|E

25|$|Shunting signals allow a {{train to}} move forward onto a line which may already be occupied, for example the {{platform}} of a station, a siding, or a particular road in a marshaling yard. Modern ones comprise of three lenses in a triangular formation. They may be attached to a main signal in which case they are only cleared when the shunting movement is required (known as a subsidiary signal). When cleared they display two white lights at an angle of 45° indicating that the driver may pass the signal with caution, even if the main signal is showing danger, but at a speed that allows the train to <b>stop</b> <b>short</b> of any obstruction. When not cleared these signals would be unlit, displaying nothing, and the train driver would simply obey the aspect of the main signal.|$|E
25|$|Maidens sing a delicate, sentimental song ("On {{the blue}} Vistula") to {{entertain}} Marina as her chambermaid dresses her hair. Marina declares her preference for heroic songs of chivalry. She dismisses everyone. Alone, she sings of her boredom ("How tediously and sluggishly"), of Dmitriy, {{and of her}} thirst for adventure, power, and glory. The Jesuit Rangoni enters, bemoans the wretched state of the church, attempts to obtain Marina's promise that when she becomes Tsaritsa she will convert the heretics of Moscow (Russian Orthodox Church) to the true faith (Roman Catholicism), and encourages her to bewitch the Pretender. When Marina wonders why she should do this, Rangoni angrily insists that she <b>stop</b> <b>short</b> of nothing, including sacrificing her honor, to obey the dictates of the church. Marina expresses contempt of his hypocritical insinuations and demands he leave. As Rangoni ominously tells her {{she is in the}} thrall of infernal forces, Marina collapses in dread. Rangoni demands her obedience.|$|E
25|$|A small {{attack on}} Arrow Head Copse failed, part of ZZ Trench {{into the village}} from the north was taken and the French {{captured}} Angle Wood. The attack on 21 August failed and the plan for 24 August, was changed late on 22 August. The French would attack from the Somme to Maurepas, the 35th Division would conform but <b>stop</b> <b>short</b> of the German second position and the 20th Division would take the north edge of Guillemont and the south-west of Ginchy. A German artillery bombardment and counter-attack late on 23 August, led to the cancellation of the XIV Corps attack, except {{on the right of}} the 35th Division, the French attack mostly being repulsed. On 25 August, Rawlinson announced a series of divisional reliefs, which delayed the attack to the end of August, when it was arranged that XIV Corps would attack the German second position, from Falfemont Farm to Guillemont. Heavy rain began to fall on 25 August and turned the ground into a swamp, preventing the digging of assembly trenches, blocking routes to the front line and severely slowing the flow of supplies. The bombardment opened in the morning of 29 August and the attack was postponed again to 1 September, then postponed again to 3 September, because of a thunderstorm on 29 August.|$|E

500|$|Occasionally, a {{train is}} {{launched}} with not enough speed {{to clear the}} crest. This typically happens in cool, wet, or breezy weather, or when the wind is working against it. In these conditions, the launch often does not provide it with enough speed to climb over the hill, which causes it to <b>stop</b> <b>short</b> of the top, and roll back down the hill in reverse, hence the term [...] "rollback". The launch track is equipped with retractable magnetic braking fins which are raised after the train is launched in order to slow one that did not crest the hill.|$|E
500|$|The book {{states that}} Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Robert Jastrow were all {{fiercely}} anti-communist and they viewed government regulation {{as a step}} towards socialism and communism. The authors argue that, {{with the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, they looked for another great threat to free market capitalism and found it in environmentalism. They feared that an over-reaction to environmental problems would lead to heavy-handed government intervention in the marketplace and intrusion into people's lives. Oreskes and Conway state that the longer the delay the worse these problems get, and the more likely it is that governments will need to take the draconian measures that conservatives and market fundamentalists most fear. They say that Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Jastrow denied the scientific evidence, contributed to a strategy of delay, and thereby helped to bring about the situation they most dreaded. The authors have a strong doubt about the ability of the media to differentiate between false truth and the actual science in question; however, they <b>stop</b> <b>short</b> of endorsing censorship in the name of science. The journalistic norm of balanced reporting has helped, according to the authors, to amplify the misleading messages of the contrarians. Oreskes and Conway state: [...] "small numbers of people can have large, negative impacts, especially if they are organised, determined and have access to power".|$|E
500|$|When the {{campaign}} season opened in May 1777, General Washington moved {{most of his}} army from its winter quarters in Morristown, New Jersey to a strongly fortified position in the Watchung Mountains. In June 1777, Howe {{began a series of}} odd moves in New Jersey, apparently in an attempt to draw Washington and his army out of that position onto terrain more favourable for a general engagement. His motives for this are uncertain; historian John Buchanan argues that Howe was determined to attempt to draw Washington into a major engagement while both were in northern New Jersey, writing that [...] "Washington's shift in position had whetted Howe's appetite for a major action when, if everything went right, he would finally accomplish what he and his brother's policies had denied him the previous year: the destruction of the Continental Army", but that Howe's underlying campaign goal for the season was Philadelphia. [...] One British major wrote that [...] "he report circulated by those in power is that it was thought necessary to march to Hilsborough to offer Washington battle." [...] Americans like Henry Knox were perplexed but also concluded that was its purpose: [...] "It was unaccountable that [...] should <b>stop</b> <b>short</b> when they had gone only nine miles ... In {{the course of a day}} or two [...] discovered that they ... had come out with an intention of drawing us into the plain." [...] Washington had intelligence that Howe had moved without taking the heavy river-crossing equipment, and was apparently not fooled at all.|$|E
