5|$|The basic {{technical}} {{reason for this}} difficulty is that the frequency response of a simple filter approaches a fall of 6 dB/octave far {{from the point of}} resonance. This means that if telephone channels are squeezed in side-by-side into the frequency spectrum, there will be crosstalk from adjacent channels in any given channel. What is required is a much more sophisticated filter that has a flat frequency response in the required passband like a low-Q resonant circuit, but that rapidly falls in response (much faster than 6dB/octave) at the transition from passband to stopband like a high-Q resonant circuit. Obviously, these are contradictory requirements to be met with a single resonant circuit. The solution to these needs was founded in the theory of transmission lines and consequently the necessary filters did not become available until this theory was fully developed. At this early stage the idea of <b>signal</b> <b>bandwidth,</b> and hence the need for filters to match to it, was not fully understood; indeed, it was as late as 1920 before the concept of bandwidth was fully established. For early radio, the concepts of Q-factor, selectivity and tuning sufficed. This was all to change with the developing theory of transmission lines on which image filters are based, as explained in the next section.|$|E

50|$|Transmitting {{a signal}} at high {{modulation}} rate through a band-limited channel can create intersymbol interference. As the modulation rate increases, the <b>signal's</b> <b>bandwidth</b> increases.

2500|$|As {{the name}} implies, {{wideband}} FM (WFM) requires a wider <b>signal</b> <b>bandwidth</b> than amplitude modulation by an equivalent modulating signal; this {{also makes the}} signal more robust against noise and interference. Frequency modulation is also more robust against signal-amplitude-fading phenomena. As a result, FM {{was chosen as the}} modulation standard for high frequency, high fidelity radio transmission, hence the term [...] "FM radio" [...] (although for many years the BBC called it [...] "VHF radio" [...] because commercial FM broadcasting uses part of the VHF band—the FM broadcast band). FM receivers employ a special detector for FM signals and exhibit a phenomenon known as the capture effect, in which the tuner [...] "captures" [...] the stronger of two stations on the same frequency while rejecting the other (compare this with a similar situation on an AM receiver, where both stations can be heard simultaneously). However, frequency drift or a lack of selectivity may cause one station to be overtaken by another on an adjacent channel. Frequency drift was a problem in early (or inexpensive) receivers; inadequate selectivity may affect any tuner.|$|E

50|$|Frequencies {{within a}} {{coherence}} bandwidth {{of one another}} tend to all fade in a similar or correlated fashion. One reason for designing the CDMA IS-95 waveform with a bandwidth of approximately 1.25 MHz is because in many urban signaling environments the coherence bandwidth Bc is significantly less than 1.25 MHz. Therefore, when fading occurs it occurs only over a relatively {{small fraction of the}} total CDMA <b>signal</b> <b>bandwidth.</b> The portion of the <b>signal</b> <b>bandwidth</b> over which fading does not occur typically contains enough signal power to sustain reliable communications.
