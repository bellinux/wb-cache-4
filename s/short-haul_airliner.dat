25|$|In the mid-to-late 1950s, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry {{identified}} {{a requirement for}} a <b>short-haul</b> <b>airliner</b> to replace Douglas DC-3s flying on Japan's domestic routes, and encouraged companies in Japan's aircraft industry to collaborate to develop and produce the new airliner. A joint venture between Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries (now {{better known as the}} parent company of automobile manufacturer Subaru), Shin Meiwa, Showa Aircraft Industry Company and Japan Aircraft Industry Company was set up in 1957, being formalised as the Nihon Aeroplane Manufacturing Company (NAMC) in 1959.|$|E
25|$|The BAe 146/Avro RJ is a high-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with a T-tail. It {{has four}} turbofan engines mounted on pylons underneath the wings, and has retractable tricycle landing gear. The aircraft has very quiet operation, {{and has been}} marketed under the name Whisperjet. It sees wide usage at small city-based airports such as London City Airport. In its primary role {{it serves as a}} regional jet, <b>short-haul</b> <b>airliner</b> or regional airliner. The BAe 146/Avro RJ is in wide use with several European-based airlines, such as Brussels Airlines, CityJet and Swiss Global Air Lines.|$|E
25|$|The British Aerospace 146 (also BAe 146) is a <b>short-haul</b> <b>airliner</b> and a {{regional}} airliner that was {{manufactured in the}} United Kingdom by British Aerospace, later part of BAE Systems. Production ran from 1983 until 2002. Manufacture of an improved version known as the Avro RJ began in 1992. A further-improved version with new engines, the Avro RJX, was announced in 1997, but only two prototypes and one production aircraft were built before production ceased in 2001. With 387 aircraft produced, the Avro RJ/BAe 146 is the most successful British civil jet airliner programme.|$|E

50|$|Regional airliners {{typically}} seat {{fewer than}} 100 passengers {{and may be}} powered by turbofans or turboprops. These airliners are the non-mainline counterparts to the larger aircraft operated by the major carriers, legacy carriers, and flag carriers and are used to feed traffic into the large airline hubs or focus cities. These particular routes may need {{the size of a}} smaller aircraft to meet the frequency needs and service levels customers expect in the marketed product that is offered by larger airlines and their modern narrow and widebody aircraft. Therefore, these <b>short-haul</b> <b>airliners</b> are usually equipped with lavatories, stand up cabins, pressurization, overhead storage bins, reclining seats, and have a flight attendant to look after the in-flight needs of the passengers during Point-to-point transit or routes.|$|R
50|$|The Cessna 208 Caravan is an American single-engined turboprop, fixed-tricycle landing gear, <b>short-haul</b> {{regional}} <b>airliner</b> {{and utility}} aircraft that is built by Cessna.

50|$|The British Aircraft Corporation One-Eleven, {{also known}} as the BAC-111 or BAC 1-11, was a British {{short-range}} jet airliner used during the 1960s and 1970s. It was the second <b>short-haul</b> jet <b>airliner</b> to enter service, following the French Sud Aviation Caravelle. The aircraft was also produced under license in Romania during the 1980s as the Rombac One-Eleven.|$|R
50|$|The de Havilland DH.104 Dove was a British <b>short-haul</b> <b>airliner</b> {{developed}} and manufactured by de Havilland. It was a monoplane {{successor to the}} prewar de Havilland Dragon Rapide biplane. The design came about from the Brabazon Committee report which, amongst other aircraft types, called for a British-designed short-haul feeder for airlines.|$|E

2500|$|British Aerospace {{promoted}} the BAe 146 to airlines as a [...] "feederliner" [...] and <b>short-haul</b> regional <b>airliner.</b> The airframe {{of the aircraft}} and many other key areas were designed to {{be as simple as}} possible. The engines lack thrust reversers due to their perceived reduced effectiveness in anticipated conditions. Instead, the BAe 146 features a large airbrake with two petals below the tail rudder {{at the rear of the}} fuselage, which has the advantage of being usable during flight and allowing for steep descent rates if required. In addition, the aircraft has full width wing spoilers which are deployed immediately on landing.|$|R

50|$|Within {{four years}} of {{entering}} airliner service, a total of 172 Caravelles had been sold {{to a range of}} operators. Aviation author M.G. Douglas attributed the type's favourable early sales record to the effective marketing campaign of performing demonstrations to prospective customers using the two prototypes, as well to the Caravelle having effectively no jet-powered rivals, being the only <b>short-haul</b> <b>airliner</b> for several years following its introduction. Several models of the Caravelle were developed and produced over the lifetime of the production run, often in response to the increasing power of the available engines, which had allowed for higher takeoff weights to be adopted.|$|E
50|$|Condor added Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 jets to its fleet, {{operated}} {{from the}} production workshop of Südflug, a 100% subsidiary of Condor. In 1991, {{as the first}} leisure carrier, Condor introduced a separate and more comfortable Comfort Class (Business Class) to its Boeing 767 long-haul fleet. The Südflug subsidiary was integrated into Condor in autumn 1992. In 1995, Condor expanded its shareholdings: Alpha Holding GmbH (30%), Kreutzer Touristik GmbH (37.5%), Fischer Reisen GmbH (100%) and Öger Tours GmbH, with 10%, {{became part of the}} Condor Tourism Group. Condor also acquired Lufthansa’s 40% holding in the Turkish charter airline SunExpress, which was later increased to 50%. In 1996, commemorating the 40th birthday of the airline, US painter James Rizzi created a special paint scheme which was applied to one of Condor's Boeing 757s. With an order for 12 aircraft, the airline became the launch customer of the enlarged Boeing 757-300. In 1998, Condor Flugdienst GmbH was owned by C&N Touristic AG (later Thomas Cook AG). With the merger of Condor Flugdienst GmbH and NUR Touristic GmbH, Deutsche Lufthansa AG and KarstadtQuelle AG created the basis for an integrated tourism group with a European format - both partners have a 50% holding in the company. In 1998, Condor Berlin GmbH was founded as a wholly owned subsidiary with headquarters at Berlin Tegel Airport. As with all other German airlines, Condor was not allowed to operate into West Berlin until 1990. It used Airbus A320 aircraft, which had recently been added to the fleet, replacing the Boeing 737 <b>short-haul</b> <b>airliners.</b> In the early 2000s, the Berlin business was moved to Schönefeld Airport.|$|R
50|$|The Dragon proved very {{attractive}} as a <b>short-haul</b> low capacity <b>airliner</b> {{and was soon}} in service worldwide. From the 63rd aircraft late in 1933, the Dragon 2, with improvements including individually framed windows and faired undercarriage struts, was produced. Even though these changes were largely cosmetic the streamlining improved the aircraft's speed by about 5 mph (8 km/h), allowed 250 lb (113 kg) more payload to be carried and added 85 mi (137 km) of range.|$|R
50|$|In Britain, the de Havilland Dragon was a {{successful}} aircraft during the 1930s. Its simple design used a plywood box fuselage. It could carry six passengers each with 45 lb of luggage on the London-Paris route on a fuel consumption of just 13 gal (49 l) per hour. The wing panels outboard of the engines could be folded for storage. The type was attractive as a <b>short-haul</b> low capacity <b>airliner</b> and was soon in service worldwide. British production of the DH.84 ended when it was replaced {{on the assembly line}} by the more powerful and elegant de Havilland Dragon Rapide.|$|R
50|$|During 1951 and 1952, British European Airways (BEA) {{internally}} formulated is own {{requirement for}} a passenger-carrying rotorcraft, {{commonly referred to}} the Bealine-Bus or BEA Bus. This {{was to be a}} multi-engined rotorcraft capable of serving as a <b>short-haul</b> <b>airliner,</b> BEA envisioned the type as being typically flown between major cities and carrying a minimum of 30 passengers in order to be economical; keen to support the initiative, the Ministry of Supply proceeded to sponsor a series of design studies to be conducted in support of the BEA requirement. Both civil and government bodies had predicted the requirement for such rotorcraft, and viewed it as being {{only a matter of time}} before they would become commonplace in Britain's transport network.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, {{with the}} issuing of backing by the French government, Dassault decided to {{commence}} work on its <b>short-haul</b> <b>airliner</b> concept. During 1968, the initial studies {{performed by the}} company's research team were orientated around a 110 to 120-seat airliner which was powered {{by a pair of}} rear-mounted Rolls Royce Spey turbofan engines; as time went on, a specification for a 150-seat aircraft with a 1000-km range (540 nm) was developed. As envisioned, the new airliner would attack this market segment at the upper end with a 140-seat jetliner, contrasting against the 100-seat Boeing 737-100 and the 115-seat Boeing 737-200 variants then in production. In April 1969, the development programme was officially launched.|$|E
50|$|Accordingly, the committee, {{which had}} become known simply as the Brabazon Committee, {{delivered}} its report, which was likewise known as the Brabazon Report. This report called {{for the construction of}} a total of four of five designs they had studied. Of these designs, the Type I was a very large transatlantic airliner, the Type II was a <b>short-haul</b> <b>airliner,</b> the Type III was a medium-range airliner for the multiple-hop 'Empire' air routes, and the Type IV was an innovative jet-powered 500 mph (800 km/h) airliner. In particular, the Type I and Type IV were regarded as being of very high importance to the industry, particularly the jet-powered Type IV which would give Britain a commanding lead in the field of jet transportation. An outline of the parameters for the various envisioned aircraft, including the gigantic Type I, was issued by the Committee.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the conceptual and detail {{design of the}} A- 90 <b>Short-haul</b> 500 seat <b>airliner</b> project. It started with a market investigation which then led to the specification of the aircraft. The author performed a conceptual design process, to derive the configuration - a twin-engined jet transport with a swept wing, shoulder mounted to a large double-bubble fuselage. Aerodynamic, mass and geometric work was then performed {{prior to the start}} of the main design programme in October 1990. The main programme involved 23 MSc students and 5 members of staff and lasted for 8 months. Each student was given responsibility for the detail design of a major component such as outer wing, fuel system, etc. This work is described together with the final design that emerged. This description is aided by the reproduction of numerous engineering drawings. The work was complemented by extra studies, performed by 15 Flight Dynamics students. The report then discusses the final configuration of the A- 90. The project showed the potential of meeting mass, cost and airport requirements. It should exceed the range requirements and carry 620 passengers for 1700 n miles, 500 for 2260 n miles or 345 for 3500 n miles. The design showed considerable flexibility and could be relatively easily developed to carry some 1000 passengers. Investigations were performed of several applications of new technology, including variable camber flaps, fibre optic flight controls, "all electric" systems and modern materials. They all looked feasible, and should be investigated further. The main concern was the provision of bleed air and secondary power following the loss of one engine, on such a large aircraft. Careful system design overcame this problem. The A- 90 project proved again the validity of Cranfield's group design project as a powerful means of educating design students...|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s, Swedish {{aircraft}} manufacturer Saab AB became increasingly {{interested in the}} civil aircraft market. In 1974, the company decided to proceed with developing its first major civilian aircraft, having previously focused almost entirely upon military aircraft. During the late 1970s, internal studies had determined that a <b>short-haul</b> <b>airliner</b> should be optimised to seat around 30 passengers. Likewise, {{it was decided that}} to make use of turboprop propulsion, which was slower but more economical than turbofan engines, and to optimise the airliner {{to take advantage of this}} type of powerplant; this decision may have been influenced by high oil prices during that decade, such as the 1973 oil crisis. According to author Gunnar Elisson, the selection of a turboprop engine made the type less attractive to airlines than jet-powered competitors, however recognised that the General Electric CT7-5A2 engine picked was quite competitive with the jet engines of that era. As conceived, the airliner was to match the performance of jets within its short-haul role.|$|E
50|$|For {{the growing}} provincial routes, {{it was a}} Dutch-built 30-seat {{airliner}} {{that would be the}} true successor to the DC-3. The Fokker F27-100 <b>short-haul</b> <b>airliner</b> suited the NAC provincial network perfectly and, like the Viscount, was Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop-powered would prove popular. The 'Friendship' had been flying since 1956. However the British government attempted to force NAC's hand into purchasing the similar Handley Page Herald, reminding their New Zealand counterparts of possible trade tariffs being imposed on purchasing a 'foreign' aircraft. A British European Airways-owned Herald was flown out to New Zealand and participated in the opening of Wellington's rebuilt airport, putting on a short field and extreme manoeuvering air display. BEA management offered to leave the demonstration Herald with NAC for a year to trial on proposed routes. The New Zealand government intervened saying the Fokker aircraft had already proved itself while the Herald was still in test mode for its changed powerplants. The Fokker F27s were also Rolls-Royce powered while most of its electronic and mechanical components were made in the United Kingdom, thus negating tariff restrictions. So the Dutch built airliner won the day and a large order over time.|$|E
