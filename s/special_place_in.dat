He was High Sheriff of Essex and of Hertfordshire in the years 1265–67, and as such became involved in the Second Barons' War (1264–1267). Southchurch has earned a <b>special</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the historiography of the period due to an episode during the war where he allegedly planned to attack London with incendiary cocks.|$|E
5|$|The Toy Story {{films and}} {{characters}} will always hold a very <b>special</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> {{our hearts and}} we're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy {{in a whole new}} way thanks to the latest in 3-D technology.

5|$|The local Cathars held a <b>special</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> their {{religion}} for horses, especially through {{their belief in}} the transmigration of souls. There was also a belief in Pamiers that knights took their horses {{with them when they}} died. In the 12th century, the Cathar princess Esclarmonde of Foix climbed to the fortress of Château de Montségur {{on the back of a}} small, sure-footed black horse. In the 14th century, the same small black horses are mentioned as accompanying the armies of Gaston III, Count of Foix.|$|E

Many social and religious institutions support homeless people and panhandlers and the Portuguese Social Security normally gives them a survival monetary subsidy.|$|R
5|$|Karnataka {{also has}} a <b>special</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the world of Indian {{classical}} music, with both Karnataka (Carnatic) and Hindustani styles finding place in the state, and Karnataka has produced a number of stalwarts in both styles. The Haridasa movement {{of the sixteenth century}} contributed significantly to the development of Karnataka (Carnatic) music as a performing art form. Purandara Dasa, one of the most revered Haridasas, is known as the Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha ('Father of Karnataka a.k.a. Carnatic music'). Celebrated Hindustani musicians like Gangubai Hangal, Mallikarjun Mansur, Bhimsen Joshi, Basavaraja Rajaguru, Sawai Gandharva and several others hail from Karnataka, and some of them have been recipients of the Kalidas Samman, Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan awards. Noted Carnatic musicians include Violin T. Chowdiah, Veena Sheshanna, Mysore Vasudevachar, Doreswamy Iyengar and Thitte Krishna Iyengar.|$|E
5|$|Karnataka {{occupies}} a <b>special</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> {{the history of}} Indian radio. In 1935, Aakashvani, the first private radio station in India, was started by Prof. M.V. Gopalaswamy in Mysore. The popular radio station {{was taken over by}} the local municipality and later by All India Radio (AIR) and moved to Bangalore in 1955. Later in 1957, AIR adopted the original name of the radio station, Aakashavani as its own. Some of the popular programs aired by AIR Bangalore included Nisarga Sampada and Sasya Sanjeevini which were programs that taught science through songs, plays and stories. These two programs became so popular that they were translated and broadcast in 18 different languages and the entire series was recorded on cassettes by the Government of Karnataka and distributed to thousands of schools across the state. Karnataka has witnessed a growth in FM radio channels, mainly in the cities of Bangalore, Mangalore and Mysore, which has become hugely popular.|$|E

Coach Doug Dickey added the {{familiar}} block letter T onto {{the side of}} the helmets in his first year in 1964; a rounded T came in 1968. Johnny Majors modified the famous orange helmet stripe to a thicker stripe in 1977.|$|R

25|$|The {{spirituality and}} sacredness of the island, its {{relative}} remoteness, and its legendary {{claim to be}} the burial site of King Arthur, have given it a <b>special</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the cultural life of Wales, attracting artists, writers and musicians to its shores. It has inspired award-winning literature, and attracted internationally renowned singers.|$|E
25|$|Possession holds a <b>special</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> that it {{has been}} criminalized but under common law does not {{constitute}} an act. Some countries like the United States have avoided the common law conclusion in Regina v. Dugdale by legally defining possession as a voluntary act. As a voluntary act, it fulfills the requirements to establish actus reus.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995, {{a second}} edition of The 100 Best Small Towns in America, written by Norman Crampton, {{featured}} Elkins among the <b>special</b> <b>places</b> <b>in</b> the United States.

5000|$|Passage tomb {{architecture}} spatially constrains {{the number}} of people who can simultaneously occupy their chambers, effectively restricting access to specialist kinds of knowledge [...] and unusual combinations of sensory experience. Whether these sites embody astronomical orientations, occupy <b>special</b> <b>places</b> <b>in</b> the landscape, or acted as the receptacles for ancestral remains, the camera obscura theory expands the significance and meaning of light entering these monuments.|$|R
50|$|During {{the time}} they worked out their penances, the penitents often had <b>special</b> <b>places</b> <b>in</b> church and wore special {{garments}} to indicate their status. Like the catechumens who were preparing for baptism, they were often dismissed from the Sunday assembly after the Liturgy of the Word. The use of ashes {{at the beginning of}} Lent is an extension of the use of ashes with those entering the Order of Penitents.|$|R
25|$|Jonas is {{the only}} Jewish philosopher who has fully {{integrated}} philosophy, science, theology and environmental ethics. He maintained that humans have a <b>special</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> Creation, manifest in the concept that humans are created {{in the image of}} God. His philosophy is very similar to that of Alfred North Whitehead, who believed that God is not static but dynamic, in a continual process of becoming as the universe evolves.|$|E
25|$|While the Lower East Side {{has been}} a place of {{successive}} immigrant populations, many American Jews relate to the neighborhood in a strong manner, much as Chinatown in San Francisco holds a <b>special</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the imagination of Chinese Americans, and Astoria {{in the hearts of}} Greek Americans. It was a center for the ancestors of many people in the metropolitan area, and it was written about and portrayed in fiction and films.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson's ground sloth has a <b>special</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> modern paleontology, for Thomas Jefferson's {{letter on}} Megalonyx, read before the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia in August 1796, marked the {{beginning}} of vertebrate paleontology in North America. When Lewis and Clark set out, Jefferson instructed Meriwether Lewis to {{keep an eye out for}} ground sloths. He was hoping they would find some living in the Western range. Megalonyx jeffersonii was appropriately named after Thomas Jefferson.|$|E
40|$|<b>Special</b> <b>places</b> {{are places}} {{that people feel}} strongly. These places hold {{significance}} for them based on experiences that they had there that changed their lives. These places can have restorative and therapeutic qualities. That makes these places valuable to counselors and teachers because they need to reach people in a more effective way. I analyzed place-based qualitative data from thirty-four participants about <b>special</b> <b>places.</b> I also did a literature review on <b>special</b> <b>places</b> {{to get a good}} background on the subject {{and to be able to}} compare my findings to.

50|$|Two of the {{instruments}} which held <b>special</b> <b>places</b> <b>in</b> Dodgson's were the guitar and the harpsichord. His introduction to harpsichord writing came {{through one of the}} instrument's first twentieth-century exponents, the Czech player and musicologist, Stanislav Heller. In 1959, four years after writing his first pieces for the instrument he married Jane Clark, herself a harpsichordist and an authority on François Couperin. His wife fostered an increasing fascination with early and Baroque music.|$|R
50|$|On December 3, Chichibu {{holds an}} annual night festival(Intangible {{cultural}} heritage). It attracts crowds from Chichibu, Saitama prefecture, neighboring Tokyo, and the Kantō region. Kawase matsuri is Chichibu shrine's summer festival. It takes place every July 19 and July 20. Eight groups carrying special dashi floats march along to festival music around the city. Mikoshi (sacred portable shrines) {{are brought to}} <b>special</b> <b>places</b> <b>in</b> each neighborhood where they are enshrined. Neighborhood association heads wash the mikoshi in the Arakawa River.|$|R
25|$|Most {{scholars}} {{take these}} observations {{as a strong}} clue to the literary relationship among the synoptics and Mark's <b>special</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> that relationship. The hypothesis favored by most experts is Marcan priority, that Mark was composed first and that Matthew and Luke each used Mark and incorporated most of it, with adaptations, into their own gospels. A leading alternative hypothesis is Marcan posteriority, that Mark was formed primarily by extracting what Matthew and Luke shared in common.|$|E
25|$|Another Antarctic {{explorer}} with a <b>special</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> South Georgia's {{history was}} Duncan Carse. His comprehensive 1951–57 South Georgia Survey {{resulted in the}} classical 1:200000 topographic map of South Georgia, occasionally updated but never superseded since its first publication by the British Directorate of Overseas Surveys in 1958. For several months in 1961, Carse experimented on living alone at a remote location, Ducloz Head on the southwest coast of the island. Mount Carse, the island's third highest peak is named for him.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the veneration of household Niños Dios during the Christmas season, {{there are a number}} of Child Jesus images that have year-round devotion. These Niños Dios often have a <b>special</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the worship by Mexican Catholics, but sometimes they have been the objects of “kidnapping” and disputes. Most of the best-known images are in Mexico City and central Mexico. Offerings to these images are usually toys or candy, a tradition related to offerings made to the dead for the afterlife in pre-Hispanic times.|$|E

25|$|US66 {{has come}} to stand for the collective, American tourist {{experience}} and holds a <b>special</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> American popular culture. There is a certain nostalgic appeal to Route66 {{that is associated with}} the thrill of the open road that has contributed to its popularity. Looking at the historic roadway through Illinois from a different perspective, it reveals a unique history that tells the story of movement and road building across the prairie. Study of the highway in Illinois also reveals the evolution of the Interstate Highway System and the growing popularity of automobiles.|$|E
25|$|The rest of McAllister's time at Leeds saw {{the club}} fail to {{recapture}} those heights. The highest the club finished {{during this period}} was fifth in the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons and the lowest was 17th in the 1992–93 Premier League – one of the lowest-placed finishes of a defending league champion in English football history. Despite this, he captained the side for two seasons and won a <b>special</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the hearts of Leeds United fans with his fine attitude, blistering long-range strikes and trademark free kicks.|$|E
25|$|The general {{assembly}} (or general synod) {{is the highest}} court of presbyterian polity. Each presbytery selects a number of its members to be commissioners to the {{general assembly}}. The general assembly is chaired by its own moderator, who is usually elected to a single term. He or she is addressed as moderator during meetings, but like the other moderators, his/her position has no bearing outside of the assembly meeting and affords him/her no <b>special</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> other courts. He or she presides over meetings of the assembly, and may be called on in a representative function {{for the remainder of}} the year.|$|E

30|$|The {{distribution}} of zeros {{in the character}} table of a group is a classical problem with an extensive literature {{that goes back to}} the well-known theorem of Burnside stating that any non-linear irreducible character of a finite group vanishes at some element of the group. Hence it is interesting to investigate the properties of a finite group with ‘many’ zeros or without zeros at some <b>special</b> <b>places</b> <b>in</b> its character table. There are many results about the number of zeros in the rows of a character table (see [2, 3, 6, 17] and [7], etc.).|$|R

[...] In churches such images were often given a side-chapel, and sometimes are given <b>special</b> <b>places</b> <b>in</b> the rituals of Holy Week.
