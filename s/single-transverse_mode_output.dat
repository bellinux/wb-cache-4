40|$|The {{emission}} {{characteristics of}} a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) operated in a <b>single-transverse</b> <b>mode</b> and coupled to an external cavity with a diffraction grating as a frequency-selective element are analyzed experimentally, numerically and analytically. The experiments yield a rather abrupt turn-on of the VCSEL to a high-amplitude emission state and hysteresis phenomena. The experimental results are explained by numerical simulations and analytical calculations demonstrating the possibility of bistability between lasing and non-lasing states close to threshold. Hence, the scheme might be useful in all-optical photonic switching applications. A detailed bifurcation analysis near threshold is given by superimposing the numerical results with analytical steady-state curves.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} experimentally {{the existence}} of the elliptically polarized injection-locked (EPIL) state. This state is observed when a <b>single-transverse</b> <b>mode</b> VCSEL is subject to orthogonal optical injection. The spectral feature of the EPIL state is verified and the power of each polarization is measured. The regime of the EPIL state is identified in the parameter plane of frequency detuning and injection power for different bias currents. As current decreases the frequency detuning range for the EPIL to exist is narrower and shifts toward the negative frequency detuning. Periodic dynamics of the VCSEL is found in the neighborhood of the EPIL regime.

40|$|We {{report a}} {{theoretical}} and experimental {{analysis of the}} polarization switching found in a <b>single-transverse</b> <b>mode</b> VCSEL when subject to parallel optical injection. We have found a novel situation in which injection locking of the parallel polarization and excitation of the free-running orthogonal polarization of the VCSEL are simultaneously obtained.

We show that considering two linear polarization modes in {{a model of a}} VCSEL subject to parallel optical injection leads to simpler expressions than those found for a VCSEL with only a single linear polarization.

40|$|An {{analysis}} is performed {{of the effects}} of strong optical feedback on the characteristics of <b>single-transverse</b> <b>mode</b> VCSELs. Consideration is given to the cases of short (1. 5 cm) and long (15 cm) external cavities. When the laser is operated well above threshold in a short external cavity with high reflectivity, a strong dependence on the accumulated external cavity phase is observed. Stable operation is found for an optimum phase while for other values of the phase chaotic dynamics is observed. Such behaviour is not seen near threshold where the laser output is stable for any accumulated phase. For the longer external cavity the influence of the phase term is found to be insignificant: chaotic behaviour is seen in the output over a wide range of operating currents. Advances in the design and fabrication of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) has resulted in bringing these devices from the research laboratory into commercial production and marketing.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we report on}} a {{theoretical}} investigation of the nonlinear dynamics of the polarization of multitransverse mode vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) under current modulation. Special attention {{is given to the}} comparison with a previously studied case of <b>single-transverse</b> <b>mode</b> VCSEL emitting in two orthogonal polarizations. The consideration of spatial effects in VCSEL modifies the polarization dynamics that accompanies the period doubling route to chaos for large modulation amplitudes. Depending on the modulation parameters, the excitation of a higher order transverse mode may either induce chaotic pulsing in an otherwise regularly pulsating VCSEL, or induce a time-periodic pulsing dynamics in an otherwise chaotic VCSEL. Bifurcation diagrams obtained for different modulation frequencies, several values of the dichroism, and different transverse mode characteristics allow us to identify the different scenarios of polarization dynamics in a directly modulated VCSEL. Temporal analysis of carrier number radial profile reveals considerable changes for the multitransverse mode case only constituting the physical origin of the reported changes in the temporal and polarization dynamics...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report a new method of {{photonic}} generation of microwave signals using a multi-transverse mode VCSEL subject to twofrequency optical injection. Numerical simulations show that double injection locking involving two transverse modes {{can be obtained}} in these systems. We show that the higher-order transverse mode is excited with a much larger amplitude {{than that of the}} fundamental transverse mode. The comparison with the case of a <b>single-transverse</b> <b>mode</b> VCSEL subject to similar two-frequency optical injection shows that multi-transverse mode operation of the VCSEL enhances the performance of the photonic microwave generation system. Broad tuning ranges, beyond the THz region, and narrow linewidths are demonstrated in our system.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Single-transverse</b> <b>mode</b> lasing is {{demonstrated}} in a broad-area PT-symmetric semiconductor microring arrangement. The proposed scheme is versatile, robust to fabrication errors, {{and allows for}} high brightness operation while maintaining spectral purity. OCIS codes: (140. 3570) Lasers, single-mode; (140. 3948) Microcavity devices; (140. 3410) Laser resonators Broad-area lasers provide high output powers while managing the thermal load and reducing the impact of optical nonlinearities [1, 2]. Unfortunately, enlarging the cross section of a waveguide inevitably introduces higher order transverse modes and leads to undesired filamentation [3], thus compromising the spectral and spatial fidelity of the laser and limiting {{the brightness of the}} output beam. These limitations exist on all scales, and may even be exacerbated in chip-scale semiconductor lasers, where the large gain bandwidths afforded by the active media already pose a challenge in promoting single-mode operation. Tapering along the direction of propagation and/or engineering the refractive index in the cross section have been extensively pursued as possible techniques to enforce single mode operation in such broad area semiconductor arrangements. Despite their success in suppression of higher order modes, the application of these techniques is quite limited because of their inherent sensitivity to perturbations. Lately, the selective breaking of parity-time (PT) symmetry has been proposed as a viable strategy for obtaining single transverse mode operation [4]. Along these lines, by pairing an active resonator/waveguide with a lossy but otherwise identical partner, it is possible to enforce single-spatial-mode performance, even in the presence of strong mode competition i...|$|R
