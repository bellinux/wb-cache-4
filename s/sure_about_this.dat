500|$|When {{composing}} {{tracks for}} Meet Miley Cyrus, Cyrus was originally very apprehensive {{in regards to}} adding [...] "See You Again" [...] to the album. [...] "I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> song. I don't think I {{want to put it}} on the album. I don't really like it that much. It's just O.K.", she said. However, she was convinced to record it and, once she listened to the finished product, she changed her mind. She thought it was odd, but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says [...] "See You Again" [...] is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008).|$|E
2500|$|... "Dumb Head" [...] was Arnell's fifth solo single, {{released}} {{over three}} years after her solo debut, and her second for MGM Records, following [...] "Trouble's Back In Town". [...] Her earlier records had been commercial failures, never charting and receiving little press. [...] The record company teamed her with arranger Al Gorgoni and producer Jim Vienneau. [...] Arnell initially disliked the song [...] "Dumb Head", later saying in an interview:I said to my manager, [...] "I'm not so <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> song." [...] I didn't like calling myself a dumb head, especially as I had just graduated high school with high honours. [...] How could I call myself dumb and feel good about it? [...] But when we recorded it, with the kazoos {{in the background and}} all, it was fun. [...] It came out really good...|$|E

"Bishop," [...] he said, [...] "there is {{one point}} in what Mr. Stenson has been saying which I think we might and ought to {{consider}} a little more fully, and that is, what guarantees have we that Freistner really has {{the people at the}} back of him, that he'll be able to cleanse that rat pit at Berlin of the Hohenzollern and his clan of junkers--the most accursed type of politician who ever breathed? We ought to be very <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> <b>this.</b> Fenn's our man. What about it, Fenn?" ...|$|E

You keep talking about this chap at Cannes, and there never was a chap at Cannes, and I'll tell you why I'm so <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> <b>this.</b> During those two months on the Riviera, it so happens that Angela and I were practically inseparable.

5000|$|Svetlana’s {{performances}} {{have received}} consistently positive reviews from music critics around the world. In response to Souvenir D’un Lieu Cher, Robert Maxham from [...] "Fanfare Magazine" [...] wrote that [...] "This is superb recital, guaranteed to raise goose flesh on {{anything but a}} corpse - and I am not so <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the corpse. <b>This</b> is significant recording powerful in its emotional impact, is recommended with special urgency.".

He {{did not like}} to go to the Hotel Mazarin lest the cardinal should obtain news of what was going to take place, so he waited in the neighbourhood, knowing that some of Mazarin's personal friends would be <b>sure</b> to arrive <b>about</b> <b>this</b> hour. Presently he saw a colonel who, like himself, was spending the winter in Paris, and who frequently attended the cardinal's levees.|$|R

Of course you shall be made fully aware of every detail, and nothing shall be done without your approval. In fact all will depend on your own co-operation.

60|$|Since Oz {{became a}} fairyland, no man, woman or child ever dies in that land nor is anyone ever sick. Likewise the beasts {{of the forests}} never die, so that long years add to their cunning and wisdom, {{as well as to}} their size and strength. It is {{possible}} for beasts--or even people--to be destroyed, but the task is so difficult that it is seldom attempted. Because it is free from sickness and death is one reason why Oz is a fairyland, but it is doubtful whether those who come to Oz from the outside world, as Dorothy and Button-Bright and Trot and Cap'n Bill and the Wizard did, will live forever or cannot be injured. Even Ozma is not <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> and so the guests of Ozma from other lands are always carefully protected from any danger, so as {{to be on the safe}} side.|$|E

Well, {{he is a good}} boy; and he has gone home for a week's holiday with his friends. The proper person to supply his place with the boots and shoes and other small employments, is of course the youngest footman, a lad only {{a few years older than}} himself. What do you think Moody does? Engages a stranger, with the house full of idle men-servants already, to fill the page's place. At intervals this morning I heard them wonderfully merry in the servants hall--so merry that the noise and laughter found its way upstairs to the breakfast-room. I like my servants to be in good spirits; but it certainly did strike me that they were getting beyond reasonable limits. I questioned my maid, and was informed that the noise was all due to the jokes of the strangest old man that ever was seen. In other words, to the person whom my steward had taken it on himself to engage in the page's absence. I spoke to Moody on the subject. He answered in an odd, confused way, that he had exercised his discretion to the best of his judgment and that (if I wished it), he would tell the old man to keep his good spirits under better control. I asked him how he came to hear of the man. He only answered, 'By accident, my Lady'--and not one more word could I get out of him, good or bad. Moody engages the servants, as you know; but on every other occasion he has invariably consulted me before an engagement was settled. I really don't feel at all <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> person who has been so strangely introduced into the house--he may be a drunkard or a thief. I wish you would speak to Moody yourself, Mr. Troy. Do you mind ringing the bell?" ...|$|E
50|$|The {{story begins}} with Betty dealing {{with trying to}} get into an {{elevator}} full of models only to exceed the elevator limits. As Betty prepares to help Daniel to manage his first solo Fashion Week, she has to give Justin's class a tour of MODE. Justin's classmates only seem interested in celebrities, high fashion, and being thin, so they're naturally attracted to Amanda after they see her. When Betty sees the young schoolgirls throwing their lunches in the trash, including a bewildered Hilary, who seems to pressured by a pair of classmates and gives in, she tells Daniel that they have to change MODE and suggests that they use healthy normal looking models for their Fashion Week show, but Daniel isn't so <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> doing <b>this</b> because of one person that would have to agree on changing it, and that would be Alexis, who just gave Daniel a new chair as a gesture to bury the hatchet.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, a dejected-looking Johnson, {{the first of}} the two sprinters to be interviewed post-race by CBS in their live broadcast, {{explained}} that he pulled a quad muscle. Asked to comment on claims that are now <b>sure</b> to follow <b>about</b> <b>this</b> clearly proving that Bailey is the world's fastest man, Johnson responded: [...] "Even if I had won it, and I feel very confident that I could have, some people would've said that. Everyone is always entitled to their opinion and, you know, I can't do anything about that".|$|R
5000|$|Only three horses {{appeared}} to oppose Churchill when the colt started at odds of 1/4 for the Group Two Futurity Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 21 August. Ridden by Seamie Heffernan {{he took the}} lead inside the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win by two lengths from the Jim Bolger-trained Radio Silence. After the race O'Brien commented [...] "He's lazy and doesn't do a lot {{when he gets to}} the front, but he quickened nicely to get there. He'll come back here for the National Stakes next month. We think he's a Guineas horse and that he'll get further than a mile. He might get {{a mile and a half}} but the way he works you wouldn't be <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> that at <b>this</b> stage".|$|R

60|$|After that Weston sat {{very still}} for several minutes, though {{he found it}} {{exceedingly}} difficult. He had more than once {{during the last few}} weeks doubted that Grenfell had ever found the quartz-reef at all, for it seemed quite possible that he had, as the track-grader suggested, merely fancied that he had done so, and the man's manner had borne out that supposition. Cut off from the whisky, he had now and then fallen into fits of morbid moodiness, during which he seemed very far from <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the gold. <b>This</b> had naturally occasioned Weston a good deal of anxiety. He had thrown up his occupation and sunk his last dollar in the venture, and the finding of the quartz-reef would, he commenced to realize, open up to him alluring possibilities. At length his companion spoke slowly.|$|R
40|$|The {{notion of}} real {{radicals}} {{is a fundamental}} tool in Real Algebraic Geometry. It takes {{the role of the}} radical ideal in Complex Algebraic Geometry. In this article I shall describe the zero-dimensional approach and efficiency improvement I have found during the work on my diploma thesis at the University of Kaiserslautern (cf. [6]). The main focus of this article is on maximal ideals and the properties they have to fulfil to be real. New theorems and properties about maximal ideals are introduced which yield an heuristic prepare_max which splits the maximal ideals into three classes, namely real, not real and the class where we can't be sure whether they are real or not. For the latter we have to apply a coordinate change into general position until we are <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> realness. Finally <b>this</b> constructs a randomized algorithm for real radicals. The underlying theorems and algorithms are described in detail...|$|R
5000|$|However, Karłowicz was not <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> rather extreme gesture.

30|$|The {{findings}} highlight {{a slight}} drop in confidence level {{for those in}} the experimental group compared to the control group in the post-test phase. The potential reason for this may be the feeling of being tested, which in turn may have impacted the radiographers’ inherent confidence levels in their responses. For example, radiographers may have initially felt confident, but this may have translated to under-confidence as they perceived their knowledge was being tested. In addition to, access to the app and the retest experiment may have created uncertainty in radiographers’ responses. For example, radiographers may have thought that they knew enough about a particular topic, but on accessing the app, they felt they were not <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> their knowledge. <b>This</b> finding is contrary to the recent studies undertaken by Ling et al., (2014) and Kim et al., (2017) who refer to higher scores on confidence in students’ performance and knowledge following engagement with prescribed learning materials [20, 25].|$|R
