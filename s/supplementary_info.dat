The large nonlinear inductance of the SQUID {{gives rise to}} strong Kerr nonlinearity in {{the response of the}} SSR, which in turn results in strong coupling between different modes of the SSR. We experimentally demonstrate that such intermode coupling gives rise to dephasing of microwave photons. The dephasing rate depends periodically on the external magnetic flux applied to the SQUID, where the largest rate is obtained at half integer values (in units of the flux quantum).

40|$|We outline a {{new method}} to derive a "snapshot" {{metallicity}} estimate of stellar systems (providing one resolves {{at least the}} brightest part of the CMD) just {{on the basis of}} low-resolution (i. e., 6 - 8 A FWHM) spectroscopy of a small stellar sample. Our method relies on the Fe 5270 Lick index measurements and takes advantage of the special behavior of this spectral feature, that reaches its maximum strength among the ubiquitous component of K-type giants. This makes the Fe 5270 (max} estimate a robust and model-independent tracer of cluster [Fe/H], being particularly insensitive to the age of the stellar population. A comparison of the Fe 5270 (max) distribution derived from globular and open clusters, {{as well as from the}} field giant population in the Galaxy disk, confirms a tight correlation of the index maximum vs. cluster [Fe/H] allover the entire metallicity range for stellar population with [Fe/H] >~ - 2. 0. Relying on a theoretical calibration of the feature, we trust to effectively infer cluster metallicity within a typical uncertainty of 0. 1 - 0. 2 dex, depending on RGB luminosity sampling of the observations.

For smaller N, only the gap at the critical point is relevant, where it scales polynomially, as long as the phase transition is second order.

We found that the lattice distortion ((c-a) /a) of L 10 martensite monotonously changes with the substitution of Mn for Ga atoms and shows a kink behavior at Ga(at. %) = 25 due to the weakened covalent effect between main-group and transition-metal atoms. Moreover, owing to the competition between covalence hybridization and magnetic ordering of introduced Mn atoms, the molecular magnetic moment and Curie temperature coincidently show maximums at Ga(at. %) = 25 as well.

We find that the dynamics of a driven Kagome Mott insulator is well-captured by an effective Floquet spin model, with heating strongly suppressed, inducing a scalar spin chirality S_i · (S_j × S_k) term which dynamically breaks time-reversal while preserving SU(2) spin symmetry.

We provide a counterexample by analyzing the non-adiabatic separation of a localized quantum state from a Fermi sea due to a closing tunnel barrier. We identify the relevant energy scales and suggest ways to separate the contributions of quantum non-adiabatic excitation and backtunneling to the rare non-capture events. In the optimal regime of balanced decay and non-adiabaticity, our simple electron trap turns into a single-lead Landau-Zener-backtunneling interferometer, revealing the dynamical phase accumulated between the particle capture and leakage. The predicted "quantum beats in backtunneling" may turn the error of a single-electron source into a valuable signal revealing essentially non-adiabatic energy scales of a dynamic quantum dot.

Recently, {{by taking advantage of}} the spin dependent thermoelectric properties of magnetic materials, novel means of generating spin-currents from temperature gradients, and their associated thermal spin torques (TSTs) have been proposed, but so far these TSTs have not been large enough to influence MTJ switching. Here we demonstrate significant TSTs in MTJs by generating large temperature gradients across ultrathin MgO tunnel barriers that considerably affect the switching fields of the MTJ. We attribute the origin of the TST to an asymmetry of the tunneling conductance across the zero-bias voltage of the MTJ. Remarkably, we estimate through magneto-Seebeck voltage measurements that the charge-currents that would be generated due to the temperature gradient would give rise to STT that is a thousand times too small to account for the changes in switching fields that we observe.

A homogeneous, straight cylinder below a critical line mass is marginally stable. However, if the cylinder is bent, e. g. with a slight sinusoidal perturbation, an otherwise stable configuration starts to oscillate, is triggered into fragmentation and collapses. This previously unstudied behavior allows a filament to fragment at any given scale, {{as long as it}} has slight bends. We call this process `geometrical fragmentation'. In our realization the spacing between the cores matches the wavelength of the sinusoidal perturbation, whereas up to now, filaments were thought to be only fragmenting on the characteristical scale set by the mass-to-line ratio. Using first principles, we derive the oscillation period as well as the collapse timescale analytically. To enable a direct comparison with observations, we study the line-of-sight velocity for different inclinations. We show that the overall oscillation pattern can hide the infall signature of cores.

While recent experiments have suggested {{the existence of the}} requisite broken symmetry phase in the high-T_c cuprates, the signature of quantum-critical fluctuations in the electronic structure has thus far remained elusive, leaving their importance for high-T_c superconductivity in question. We use magnetic fields exceeding 90 tesla to access the underlying metallic state of the cuprate YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 +_δ over an unprecedented range of doping, and magnetic quantum oscillations reveal a strong enhancement in the quasiparticle effective mass toward optimal doping. This mass enhancement is a characteristic signature of quantum criticality, and identifies a quantum-critical point at p_crit ≈ 0. 18. This point also represents the juncture of the vanishing pseudogap energy scale and the disappearance of Kerr rotation, the negative Hall coefficient, and the recently observed charge order, suggesting a mechanism of high-T_c that is strongest when these definitive experimental signatures of the underdoped cuprates converge at a quantum critical point.

We find they are universal functions of the chemical potential. Despite arising from the strongly correlated regime of the Hubbard model, these functions are given by the weakly interacting, dilute Fermi gas model. These observables and their derivatives are the only expected universal static observables of this universality class, which we also confirm by verifying there is no scaling collapse of the kinetic energy, fraction of doubly occupied sites, and nearest neighbor spin correlations. Our work resolves the universality class of the intermediate temperature Mott/metal crossover, which had alternatively been proposed to be described by more exotic theories.

Here we investigate a new class of granular interactions: rapid intrusions by objects that change shape (self-deform) through passive and active means. Systematic studies of a simple spring-mass robot jumping on dry granular media reveal that jumping performance is explained by an interplay of nonlinear frictional and hydrodynamic drag as well as induced added mass (unaccounted by traditional intrusion models) characterized by a rapidly solidified region of grains accelerated by the foot. A model incorporating these dynamics reveals that added mass degrades the performance of certain self-deformations due to a shift in optimal timing during push-off. Our systematic robophysical experiment reveals both new soft matter physics and principles for robotic self-deformation and control, which together provide principles of movement in deformable terrestrial environments.

40|$|Globular {{clusters}} {{trace the}} formation {{history of the}} spheroidal components of both our Galaxy and others, which represent the bulk of star formation over {{the history of the}} universe. They also exhibit a range of metallicities, with metal-poor clusters dominating the stellar halo of the Galaxy, and higher metallicity clusters found within the inner Galaxy, associated with the stellar bulge, or the thick disk. Age differences between these clusters can indicate the sequence in which the components of the Galaxy formed, and in particular which clusters were formed outside the Galaxy and later swallowed along with their original host galaxies, and which were formed in situ. Here we present an age determination of the metal-rich globular cluster 47 Tucanae by fitting the properties of the cluster white dwarf population, which implies an absolute age of 9. 9 (0. 7) Gyr at 95 % confidence. This is about 2. 0 Gyr younger than inferred for the metal-poor cluster NGC 6397 from the same models, and provides quantitative evidence that metal-rich clusters like 47 Tucanae formed later than the metal-poor halo clusters like NGC 6397.

40|$|Giant stellar clumps are {{ubiquitous}} in high-redshift galaxies. They {{are thought to}} play an important role in the build-up of galactic bulges and as diagnostics of star formation feedback in galactic discs. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) blank field imaging surveys have estimated that these clumps have masses up to 10 ^ 9. 5 M_ and linear sizes larger than 1 kpc. Recently, gravitational lensing has also been used to get higher spatial resolution. However, both recent lensed observations and models suggest that the clumps properties may be overestimated by the limited resolution of standard imaging techniques. A definitive proof of this observational bias is nevertheless still missing. Here we investigate directly the effect of resolution on clump properties by analysing multiple gravitationally-lensed images of the same galaxy at different spatial resolutions, down to 30 pc. We show that the typical mass and size of giant clumps, generally observed at ∼ 1 kpc resolution in high-redshift galaxies, are systematically overestimated. The high spatial resolution data, only enabled by strong gravitational lensing using currently available facilities, support smaller scales of clump formation by fragmentation of the galactic gas disk via gravitational instabilities.

40|$|Solutes {{added to}} {{solutions}} often dramatically impact molecular processes {{ranging from the}} suspension or precipitation of colloids to biomolecular associations and protein folding. Here we revisit {{the origins of the}} effective attractive interactions that emerge between and within macromolecules immersed in solutions containing cosolutes that are preferentially excluded from the macromolecular interfaces. Until recently, these depletion forces were considered to be entropic in nature, resulting primarily from the tendency to increase the space available to the cosolute. However, recent experimental evidence indicates the existence of additional, energetically-dominated mechanisms. In this review we follow the emerging characteristics of these different mechanisms. By compiling a set of available thermodynamic data for processes ranging from protein folding to protein-protein interactions, we show that excluded cosolutes can act through two distinct mechanisms that correlate to a large extent with their molecular properties. For many polymers at low to moderate concentrations the steric interactions and molecular crowding effects dominate, and the mechanism is entropic. To contrast, for many small excluded solutes, such as naturally occurring osmolytes, the mechanism is dominated by favorable enthalpy, whereas the entropic contribution is typically unfavorable. We review the available models for these thermodynamic mechanisms, and comment on the need for new models that would be able to explain the full range of observed depletion forces.
