40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a market model {{which is based}} on {{reputation}} and reinforcement learning algorithms for buying and <b>selling</b> <b>agents.</b> Three important factors: quality, price and delivery-time are considered in the model. We take into account the fact that buying agents can have different priorities on quality, price and delivery-time of their goods and <b>selling</b> <b>agents</b> adjust their bids according to buying agents preferences. Also we have assumed that multiple <b>selling</b> <b>agents</b> may offer the same goods with different qualities, prices and delivery-times. In our model, <b>selling</b> <b>agents</b> learn to maximize their expected profits by using reinforcement learning to adjust product quality, price and delivery-time. Also each <b>selling</b> <b>agent</b> models the reputation of buying agents based on their profits for that seller and uses this reputation to consider discount for reputable buying agents. Buying agents learn to model the reputation of <b>selling</b> <b>agents</b> based on different features of goods: reputation on quality, reputation on price and reputation on delivery-time to avoid interaction with disreputable <b>selling</b> <b>agents.</b> The model has been implemented with Aglet and tested in a large-sized marketplace. The results show that selling/buying agents that model the reputation of buying/selling agent...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{reinforcement}} learning {{is used in}} order to model the reputation of buying and <b>selling</b> <b>agents.</b> Two important factors, quality and price, are considered in the proposed model. Each <b>selling</b> <b>agent</b> learns to evaluate the reputation of buying agents, based on their pro ts for that seller and uses this reputation to dedicate a discount for reputable buying <b>agents.</b> Also, <b>selling</b> <b>agents</b> learn to maximize their expected pro ts by using {{reinforcement learning}} to adjust the quality and price of the products, {{in order to satisfy}} the buying agents' preferences. In contrast, buying agents evaluate the reputation of <b>selling</b> <b>agents</b> based on two di erent factors: Reputation based on quality and price. Therefore, buying agents avoid interacting with disreputable <b>selling</b> <b>agents.</b> In addition, the fact that buying agents can have di erent priorities on the quality and price of their goods is taken into account. The proposed model has been implemented with Aglet and tested in a large-sized marketplace. The results show that selling/buying agents that use the proposed algorithms in this paper obtain more satisfaction than the other selling/buying agents...|$|R
5000|$|In {{markets where}} the average selling time of a luxury {{property}} is high, buying agents tend to split the fee with the <b>selling</b> <b>agent</b> and therefore the service has no additional cost to the buyer. This happens because the <b>selling</b> <b>agent</b> typically prefers splitting his commission with the buying agent rather than waiting longer to find another buyer and sell the same property. In case the buying agent sources a private deal then they charge up to the <b>selling</b> <b>agent</b> commission (for instance the full 5% in the French Riviera [...] up to 2% in Spain.|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} default {{rule in the}} United States {{has been}} that, where two brokerage firms participate {{in the sale of}} a piece residential real estate, both firms are fiduciaries of the seller. This article provides original empirical evidence showing to be erroneous a common assumption - that, in conflicts between their principals and third parties, real estate agents promote their principals 2 ̆ 7 interests - underlying revisions made in a number of jurisdictions to those principles in the last twenty years. This article examines whether agents act in accordance with their duties along two dimensions: First, we hypothesize that <b>selling</b> <b>agents</b> may secure business by taking actions that promote the interests of buyers to the detriment of <b>selling</b> <b>agents</b> 2 ̆ 7 principals, the sellers, in ways that decrease sales prices. Second, we examine whether sellers receive worse sales prices where the selling and listing functions are divided between two firms. Such a relationship would be consistent with <b>selling</b> <b>agents</b> improperly seeking to promote buyers 2 ̆ 7 interests, with intra-firm relationships restraining that misconduct better than inter-firm relationships. The results support the conclusion that, to secure business, <b>selling</b> <b>agents</b> who are fiduciaries of sellers use actions that decrease the returns to their principals, with some evidence that the participation of a listing agent in the same firm as the <b>selling</b> <b>agent</b> partially restrains this activity. In sum, some economically significant malfeasance is not restrained by the duties imposed by law...|$|R
5000|$|In very liquid markets(like London or Paris) {{the buying}} agent fee is charged {{on top of}} the <b>selling</b> <b>agent</b> fee, so the buying agent service comes at an {{additional}} cost to the property buyer unless the buying agent is able to find a property that is not sold by an agent.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a scenario for a distributed marketplace whose scope {{can be the}} whole Web where resource discovery agents find out about resources that may {{want to join the}} marketplace and electronic commerce is realised through buying agents representing the customers and the <b>selling</b> <b>agents</b> representing the resources like electronic catalogs.

In this architecture, the resources expose their metadata using Resource Description Framework (RDF) to be accessed by the resource discovery agents and their content through Extensible Markup Language (XML) to be accessed by the <b>selling</b> <b>agents</b> by using Document Object Model (DOM).

40|$|Electronic markets {{hold the}} {{potential}} for great economic efficiency, with a free flow of goods between autonomous buying and <b>selling</b> <b>agents.</b> The general challenge is how, given {{a set of rules}} governing the market, we can best design these agents so as to maximize their individual utility. An issue which arises in this domain is that self-interested sellers may deceive buyers about the quality of goods being sold. This research will develop techniques for buying <b>agents</b> to avoid <b>selling</b> <b>agents</b> with low quality goods by modeling the reputation of <b>selling</b> <b>agents.</b> The domain of reputation modeling in electronic markets has inherent uncertainty due to possible deception on the part of other agents. This uncertainty has previously been addressed using a variety of statistical techniques such as the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence [6] and beta probability density functions [2]. This research will examine how Bayesian techniques {{can be applied to the}} problem. Specifically, how belief networks can be used to model how different observations made by an agent, such as the type of good and the price at which it is offered, can be combined to form a single seller reputation and how this can inform the expected quality of a good bought from that seller. We will investigate how the belief network can be updated to reflect the results of any purchase decisions made by a buying agent...|$|R

In our mechanism, buying agents model other buyers and select the most trustworthy ones as their neighbors from which they can ask advice about sellers. In order to build reputation, sellers will model the reputation of buyers {{based on the number}} of their neighborhoods and increase values of products to satisfy reputable buyers. In consequence, our mechanism creates incentive for buyers to provide fair ratings of sellers. We also discuss how a marketplace designed in this way leads to better profit both for buyers and sellers and as such fosters trust between the agents and their human users...|$|R
