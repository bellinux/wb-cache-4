500|$|<b>Several</b> <b>estate</b> cottages near Weston Lodge were {{designed}} by W. E. Nesfield between 1860 and 1866, and are among his earliest works. They include Stowford and Magnolia Cottages (1864–65), which Nikolaus Pevsner describes as [...] "cheerful and just a little Kate Greenaway", Smithy Cottage (around 1865) and Fir Tree Cottage (1865), all listed at grade II, {{as well as a}} half-timbered farmhouse on Weston Road. Rather than either the Jacobean mansion or its High Victorian interiors, their style derives from buildings of the Home Counties, with tile hanging, incised pargetting, half-hipped gables and high chimneys.

2500|$|During the Second World War and after, the Nyasaland {{government}} faced increasing African opposition. Many grievances {{came from}} the tenants on European-owned estates who increasingly resented the imposition of thangata, originally a form of labour rent but now often a form of sharecropping. Not only was thangata itself hated, but <b>several</b> <b>estate</b> managers increased tensions by denying the sons-in-law of existing tenants the right to settle, delaying payment of wages, demanding that tenants grow cash crops rather than food or by large-scale evictions. Smallholders living on Native Trust Land often suffered overcrowding, made worse by new conservation practices and the eviction of former estate tenants. [...] The colonial Agricultural Department had advocated new methods of cultivation and soil conservation. As these were not generally accepted, the department decided to use compulsion, Smallholders disliked the imposed rules designed to limit soil erosion which involved them in considerable extra labour, and widely opposed them.|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{the cost}} of the {{conversion}} (about GB£800) it would appear that most were carried out on the 3500 rather than on the 2000, with even fewer 2200s made.

The quality of the conversion also left a great deal to be desired, with the estate conversion being pop-riveted on to the back end of the modified vehicle, with little rust-proofing or paint applied. As a result, the back end of the vehicles often rusted out, and <b>several</b> <b>estate</b> [...] "pods" [...] were subsequently transferred from one car to another.|$|E
