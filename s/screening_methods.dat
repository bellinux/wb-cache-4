5|$|Approaches to {{the design}} of {{genome-wide}} RNAi libraries can require more sophistication than the design of a single siRNA for a defined set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for genome annotation and has triggered the development of high-throughput <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> based on microarrays. However, the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E

25|$|The {{two most}} {{commonly}} used <b>screening</b> <b>methods,</b> physical examination of the breasts by a healthcare provider and mammography, can offer an approximate likelihood that a lump is cancer, and may also detect some other lesions, such as a simple cyst. When these examinations are inconclusive, a healthcare provider can remove {{a sample of the}} fluid in the lump for microscopic analysis (a procedure known as fine needle aspiration, or fine needle aspiration and cytology—FNAC) to help establish the diagnosis. The needle aspiration may be performed in a healthcare provider's office or clinic using local anaesthetic if required. A finding of clear fluid makes the lump highly unlikely to be cancerous, but bloody fluid may be sent off for inspection under a microscope for cancerous cells. Together, physical examination of the breasts, mammography, and FNAC can be used to diagnose breast cancer with a good degree of accuracy.|$|E
25|$|PSA {{can also}} be found at low levels in other body fluids, such as urine and breast milk, thus setting a high minimum {{threshold}} of interpretation to rule out false positive results and conclusively state that semen is present. While traditional tests such as crossover electrophoresis have a sufficiently low sensitivity to detect only seminal PSA, newer diagnostics tests developed from clinical prostate cancer <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> have lowered the threshold of detection down to 4ng/mL. This level of antigen {{has been shown to be}} present in the peripheral blood of males with prostate cancer, and rarely in female urine samples and breast milk. No studies have been performed to assess the PSA levels in the tissues and secretions of pre-pubescent children. Therefore, the presence of PSA from a high sensitivity (4ng/mL) test cannot conclusively identify the presence of semen, so care must be taken with the interpretation of such results.|$|E
25|$|Screening by {{hysteroscopy}} {{to obtain}} cell samples obtained for histological examination is being developed. This {{is similar to}} the current pap smear that is used to detect cervical cancer. The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening is testing a screening technique that combines CA-125 blood tests with transvaginal ultrasound. Other studies suggest that this screening procedure may be effective. However, it's not yet clear if this approach could actually help to save lives—the full results of the trial will be published in 2015. One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery. The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population. Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} effort was to explore the usefulness of a new saliency metric in a new saliency <b>screening</b> <b>method.</b> The new metric, the SN saliency metric, is based upon signal-to-noise ratios and incorporates the neural network's treatment of a reference noise feature into the calculation. The SN saliency metric, in turn, was used in a new saliency <b>screening</b> <b>method,</b> the SN saliency <b>screening</b> <b>method,</b> which attempts to identify salient features in one <b>screening</b> run. This <b>method</b> actually interrupts the screening run at certain intervals, determines the least salient feature, removes that feature and continues the screening run. A feature's saliency is indicated by {{the order in which}} it is removed and the classification error rate's reaction to its removal. No statistical validation of this saliency <b>screening</b> <b>method</b> is developed, but confidence in the method is bolstered empirically through its application to two example problems: Fisher's Iris Classification problem and the XOR problem. A designed experiment explores the consistency of the SN saliency metric across a range of neural network architectures.

40|$|Background: Podiatrists {{routinely}} perform non-invasive {{lower limb}} vascular assessment, however frequently cite {{time as a}} major barrier in performing regular assessment. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop an evidence-based vascular assessment method to guide podiatrists’ decision-making processes to aid in timely vascular assessment in at risk populations. Method: The sample underwent brachial pressure measurement, ankle pressures, toe pressure and Doppler waveform with colour duplex ultrasound (CFDU) used as the reference standard. Both the targeted <b>screening</b> <b>method</b> and the American Heart Association (AHA) guideline for vascular screening were then applied to the data set and sensitivity and specificity of each method was calculated. Results: One hundred nineteen participants were included. Sensitivity of the targeted <b>screening</b> <b>method</b> (62 %, 95 % CI 47. 17 – 75. 35) was higher than the AHA method (49 %, 95 % CI 34. 75 – 63. 40), however, specificity of the AHA method (94 %, 95 % CI 85. 62 – 98. 37) was higher than the targeted <b>screening</b> <b>method</b> (85 %, 95 % CI 74. 26 – 92. 60).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Seismic <b>Screening</b> <b>Method</b> {{is to provide a}} comprehensive, rational, and {{inexpensive}} method for evaluating the relative seismic integrity of a large building inventory using substantial life-safety as the minimum goal. The substantial life-safety goal is deemed to be satisfied if the extent of structural damage or nonstructural component damage does not pose a significant risk to human life. The screening is limited to Performance Category (PC) - 0, - 1, and - 2 buildings and structures. Because of their higher performance objectives, PC- 3 and PC- 4 buildings automatically fail the LANL Seismic <b>Screening</b> <b>Method</b> and will be subject to a more detailed seismic analysis. The Laboratory has also designated that PC- 0, PC- 1, and PC- 2 unreinforced masonry bearing wall and masonry infill shear wall buildings fail the LANL Seismic <b>Screening</b> <b>Method</b> because of their historically poor seismic performance or complex behavior. These building types are also recommended for a more detailed seismic analysis. The results of the LANL Seismic <b>Screening</b> <b>Method</b> are expressed in terms of separate scores for potential configuration or physical hazards (Phase One) and calculated capacity/demand ratios (Phase Two). This two-phase method allows the user to quickly identify buildings that have adequate seismic characteristics and structural capacity and screen them out from further evaluation. The resulting scores also provide a ranking of those buildings found to be inadequate. Thus, buildings not passing the screening can be rationally prioritized for further evaluation. For the purpose of complying with Executive Order 12941, the buildings failing the LANL Seismic <b>Screening</b> <b>Method</b> are deemed to have seismic deficiencies, and cost estimates for mitigation must be prepared.
