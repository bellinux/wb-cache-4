40|$|The {{number of}} {{processors}} embedded on high performance computing platforms is continuously increasing to accommodate user desire to solve larger and more complex problems. However, {{as the number of}} components increases, so does the probability of failure. Thus, both scalable and fault-tolerance of software are important issues in this field. To ensure reliability of the software especially under the failure circumstance, the reliability analysis is needed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a high-availability system architecture called INDRA — an INtegrated framework for Dependable and Revivable Architecture that enhances a multicore processor (or CMP) with novel security and fault recovery mechanisms. INDRA represents the first {{effort to create}} remote attack immune, <b>self-healing</b> <b>network</b> services using the emerging multicore processors. By exploring the property of a tightly-coupled multicore system, INDRA pioneers several concepts. It creates a hardware insulation, establishes finegrained fault monitoring, exploits monitoring/backup concurrency, and facilitates fast recovery services with minimal performance impact. In addition, INDRA’s fault/exploit monitoring is implemented in software rather than in hardware logic, thereby providing better flexibility and upgradability. To provide efficient service recovery and thus improve service availability, we propose a novel delta state backup and recovery on-demand mechanism in INDRA that substantially outperforms conventional checkpointing schemes. We demonstrate and evaluate INDRA’s capability and performance using real network services and a cycle-level architecture simulator.

Runtime: 48 : 49 minutesModern industrial control systems (ICSes) are increasingly adopting Internet technology to boost control efficiency, which unfortunately opens up a new front for a potential “cyber Pearl Harbor. ” People typically applied existing security techniques, such as firewalls or anti-virus software to secure ICSes.

40|$|The optical {{networks}} {{provide the}} backbone infrastructure for telecommunication networks. Because of the high-speed of optical networks, network failure {{such as a}} cable cut or node failure {{may result in a}} tremendous loss of data and hence revenue received. The p-cycle is a novel approach reported for design of survivable optical WDM networks. They are preconfigured protection structure, combining fast restoration speed of ring and mesh protection efficiency. The main issue in p-cycle network design is to find a set of p-cycles to protect a given working capacity distribution so that total spare capacity used by the p-cycles is minimized. An Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is the most efficient method reported in the literature for designing of optimal p-cycles. Where complexity of ILP increases as the size of network increases, i. e., it is not so efficient in case of large networks.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade botnets survived by {{adopting}} a sequence of increasingly sophisticated strategies to evade detection and take overs, and to monetize their infrastructure. At the same time, the success of privacy infrastructures such as Tor {{opened the door to}} illegal activities, including botnets, ransomware, and a marketplace for drugs and contraband. We contend that the next waves of botnets will extensively subvert privacy infrastructure and cryptographic mechanisms. In this work we propose to preemptively investigate the design and mitigation of such botnets. We first, introduce OnionBots, what we believe will be the next generation of resilient, stealthy botnets. OnionBots use privacy infrastructures for cyber attacks by completely decoupling their operation from the infected host IP address and by carrying traffic that does not leak information about its source, destination, and nature. Such bots live symbiotically within the privacy infrastructures to evade detection, measurement, scale estimation, observation, and in general all IP-based current mitigation techniques. Furthermore, we show that with an adequate <b>self-healing</b> <b>network</b> maintenance scheme, that is simple to implement, OnionBots achieve a low diameter and a low degree and are robust to partitioning under node deletions. We developed a mitigation technique, called SOAP, that neutralizes the nodes of the basic OnionBots.

In light of the potential of such botnets, we believe that the research community should proactively develop detection and mitigation methods to thwart OnionBots, potentially making adjustments to privacy infrastructure.

At first glance the complexity of such applications is overwhelming, given the serious resource limitations of sensor nodes, in terms of computational power, storage space, radio performance and battery power. However, WSNs have a unique feature that balances the inherent resource limitations: the ability of in-network collaboration at scale. Through collaboration WSNs can organize efficiently, prolong system lifetime, handle dynamics, detect and correct errors, all with the final goal of eventually executing reliably the user application. Following this line, researchers devised an impressive number of collaborative WSN algorithms and protocols in recent years. Significant progress has also been made on the market side, so that nowadays we can claim that WSNs are no longer just lab prototypes. Standardization initiatives (such as IEEE 802. 15. 4) are being put into practice and the general industry trend strongly suggests that the epoch of pioneering research in building and experimenting with “motes” is approaching an end.

Inspired by the metal-coordination chemistry found in byssus coating, scientists have synthesized an array of self-healing hydrogels with catechol-modified, 4 -branched PEG (4 cPEG) and various metal ions, primarily Fe 3 +. While considerable testing has been conducted with 4 cPEG, the effects of changing the polymer backbone have not been investigated extensively. Here, alginate was chemically modified with catechol attachments (Alg-C), and metal-coordinated with Fe 3 + to yield a <b>self-healing</b> <b>network</b> with similar qualities to 4 cPEG gels. Rheological measurements indicated that metal-coordination played a dominant role in the bulk mechanics of the network, although the ionic crosslinking caused the gel {{to act as a}} solid across all frequencies, in contrast to 4 cPEG. In addition, the stiff alginate backbone caused the metal-coordinate bond in itself to act on a longer time scale. Color changes in the Alg-C gel indicated that excess catechol on the backbone was oxidizing. While rheology confirmed the metal-coordination in the Alg-C network, UV-vis absorption measurements provided less certain data. Nonetheless, this study shows that metal-coordination is highly dependent on the polymer backbone, but may still be used in a variety of polymer networks. by Stephanie E. Marzen. Thesis: S.
