Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{destroying}} confiscated ivory, a government {{could choose to}} sell it, and put the funds to use in one of several ways. Several of the countries involved in the ivory trade, especially those on the <b>supply</b> <b>side</b> in Africa, are also some of the nations which struggle the most with poverty. Destroying ivory in those countries is thus often a controversial decision for internal stakeholders as well as external commentators, as the funds gained by selling the material {{could be used to}} improve the quality of life for human citizens.|$|E
5|$|On the <b>supply</b> <b>side,</b> since 2005 the {{gasoline}} fuelling stations selling more than 3 million liters of fuel {{a year are}} required to sell at least one type of biofuel, resulting in more than 1,200 gas stations selling E85 by August 2008. Despite all the sharp growth of E85 flexifuel cars, by 2007 they represented just {{two percent of the}} four million Swedish vehicles. In addition, this law also mandated all new filling stations to offer alternative fuels, and stations with an annual volume of more than one million liters are required to have an alternative fuel pump by December 2009. Therefore, the number of E85 pumps is expected to reach by 2009 nearly 60% of Sweden's 4,000 filling stations.|$|E

25|$|Biggeri and Mehrotra {{have studied}} the {{macroeconomic}} factors that encourage child labour. They focus their study on five Asian nations including India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines. They suggest that child labour {{is a serious problem}} in all five, {{but it is not a}} new problem. Macroeconomic causes encouraged widespread child labour across the world, over most of human history. They suggest that the causes for child labour include both the demand and the <b>supply</b> <b>side.</b> While poverty and unavailability of good schools explain the child labour <b>supply</b> <b>side,</b> they suggest that the growth of low-paying informal economy rather than higher paying formal economy is amongst the causes of the demand side. Other scholars too suggest that inflexible labour market, sise of informal economy, inability of industries to scale up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour.|$|E

The existing schemes—including the one developed in this research—are based on a fixed pricing rate, that is, the prices of tour options are fixed at all times irrespective of demand and fleet availability. It is of highest importance to develop a sophisticated, flexible and dynamic pricing mechanism (similar to those used for airline tickets) to carefully take both the demand and <b>supply</b> <b>sides</b> into consideration. This would greatly promote the business by accommodating long-term tourist demand.|$|R

40|$|First paragraph: Traditionally applied {{local labor}} market analysis, in both {{academic}} and policy circles, has {{focused primarily on}} either demand or supply factors, with often only a relatively token recognition of the other. This is surprising considering that the two are inexorably linked. For example, a policy proposal to increase high-skilled jobs in a given region requires a response of both the <b>supply</b> and demand <b>sides</b> {{of the labor market}} and of their complex interactions. In a regional context, this lack of attention is even more surprising. Cities and regions are particularly open systems and as such, local labor market imbalances within them on either the demand or <b>supply</b> <b>sides</b> can often be met by inter-regional mobility (migration) or intraregional mobility (e. g., commuting) as well as by occupational mobility...|$|R
