Michael Westmore made the headpiece simpler, and Dorn took to wearing a headband under the headpiece to reduce a <b>skin</b> <b>rash</b> on his forehead. The headpiece was then glued down around the edges.|$|E
5|$|In those {{receiving}} heparin {{through an}} intravenous infusion, {{a complex of}} symptoms ("systemic reaction") may occur when the infusion is started. These include fever, chills, high blood pressure, a fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and chest pain. This happens in {{about a quarter of}} people with HIT. Others may develop a <b>skin</b> <b>rash</b> consisting of red spots.|$|E
5|$|Shingles, {{also known}} as herpes zoster, {{is a viral disease}} {{characterized}} by a painful <b>skin</b> <b>rash</b> with blisters in a localized area. Typically the rash occurs in a single, wide stripe either on the left or right of the body or face. Two to four days before the rash occurs there may be tingling or local pain in the area.|$|E

5|$|Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne {{tropical}} disease {{caused by the}} dengue virus. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic <b>skin</b> <b>rash.</b> Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In {{a small proportion of}} cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.|$|E
5|$|The parsnip {{is usually}} cooked, {{but can also}} be eaten raw. It is high in {{vitamins}} and minerals, especially potassium. It also contains antioxidants and both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. It can be cultivated in deep, stone-free soils. It is attacked by the carrot fly and other insect pests, viruses, and fungal diseases, of which canker is the most serious. Handling the stems and foliage can cause a <b>skin</b> <b>rash</b> if the skin is exposed to sunlight after handling.|$|E
5|$|Allan Cunningham sent seed of G.juniperina to England in 1820; it {{was grown}} there the {{following}} year. Baron Charles von Hügel grew the species in Vienna in 1831. It has been grown outdoors in southern England, particularly G. juniperina subspecies sulphurea. Grevillea juniperina adapts easily to cultivation and {{grows in a}} wide range of soils and aspects in locations with good drainage. Long-flowering, it attracts birds such as honeyeaters with its nectar. The prickly dense foliage is also a good nesting site and shelter, particularly for smaller birds, such as finches. Many forms and hybrids have been commercially propagated and sold, some having more horticultural appeal than others. Low winter temperatures promote more prolific flowering and pruning promotes dense foliage. Plants are readily propagated by cuttings or seed, although propagation by cuttings is required to ensure the new plants have the same characteristics of the parent. Direct contact with the plant may cause a <b>skin</b> <b>rash.</b>|$|E

25|$|If {{an unusual}} black scab (eschar) {{develops}} {{at the site}} of a tick bite, or if there are any other signs of illness occurring within a few weeks of a tick bite (especially 'flu-like' symptoms, fever, generalised <b>skin</b> <b>rash,</b> muscular or joint pain), it is recommended that a doctor be consulted and informed about the tick bite – a Rickettsial infection (Rickettsia australis, or Rickettsia honei) may be the cause. Whilst many such Rickettsial infections are self-limiting, early treatment with antibiotics can prevent longer-term problems in some individuals. Doctors in Australia may also wish to investigate the possibility of a Lyme-like disease, particularly if there is also a 'bullseye' or 'target' shaped <b>skin</b> <b>rash</b> (known as erythema migrans).|$|E
25|$|Relapsing fever {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a possible cause. This disease, which is spread by ticks and lice, occurs most often during the summer months, as did the original sweating sickness.

25|$|Common {{side effects}} include rash, headache, nausea, feeling tired, and liver {{problems}}. The liver problems and <b>skin</b> <b>rash</b> may be severe {{and should be}} checked for {{during the first few}} months of treatment. It appears to be safe for use during pregnancy. It is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and works by blocking the function of reverse transcriptase.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundAs of 2014, routine {{vaccination}} strategies in Japan {{have included the}} varicella vaccine. Given {{the widespread use of}} the vaccine, it is important to investigate the safety profile of the vaccine strain, Oka/Biken varicella, in Japanese patients. MethodsReports of adverse events associated with varicella vaccination between 2005 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Virological analysis was performed on clinical specimens collected from some of the reported cases to determine whether the etiological agent was the wild-type or Oka vaccine–strains. ResultsThere were 351 reports (3. 71 / 100, 000 doses) of adverse events during the observation period. Among the 351 reports, there were 88 reports (0. 93 / 100, 000 doses) of varicella-like and 66 reports (0. 70 / 100, 000 doses) of zoster-like <b>skin</b> <b>rashes.</b> The wild-type strain induced varicella-like <b>skin</b> <b>rashes</b> earlier than the Oka vaccine strain. The Oka vaccine strain induced zoster-like <b>skin</b> <b>rashes</b> in younger patients compared to the wild-type strain. The onset of zoster-like <b>skin</b> <b>rashes</b> after vaccination was earlier in patients vaccinated with the Oka vaccine–type strain. ConclusionThe Oka/Biken vaccine is generally safe and well tolerated in Japan. Clinical aspects of adverse reactions caused by the Oka vaccine strain were consistent with previous reports from the United States and Europe...|$|R
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{clinical study}} was performed documenting {{the incidence of}} diarrhea, vomiting, and <b>skin</b> <b>rashes</b> relative to varied dosage schedules of orallyadministeredampicillin. Four hundred children were treated by randomization with one of four doses; 100 each received 50, 100, 150, or 200 mg. per kilogram per day administered in four equally divided doses, {{for a period of}} at least seven days. Vomiting or severe diarrhea was rare and was not dose related. Mild or moderate diarrhea was commonly encountered in patients regardless of dose. Erythematous maculopapular <b>skin</b> <b>rashes</b> occurred in 3 to 7 per cent of patients; there was some increase in incidence with increasing dosages but not to a significant degree. Urticarial <b>skin</b> <b>rashes</b> occurred in 1 per cent of patients and were unrelated to dose. Perineal moniliasis occurred exclusively in infants in diapers, usually with associated mild diarrhea; the incidence was significantly dose related...|$|R
25|$|Bed bug bites or cimicosis {{may lead}} to a range of skin manifestations from no visible effects to {{prominent}} blisters. Effects include <b>skin</b> <b>rashes,</b> psychological effects, and allergic symptoms.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, U.S. FDA {{recommends}} monitoring closely {{for first}} 6 weeks of therapy for above symptoms {{as there is}} high risk during this time. Monitor for {{up to the first}} 18 weeks of treatment and if a patient experiences 1) hepatitis plus rash or other systemic symptoms or 2) severe hypersensitivity or <b>skin</b> <b>rash,</b> nervirapine should not be restarted.|$|E
25|$|Other {{symptoms}} due to sarcoidosis {{of other}} organs may be uveitis (inflammation of the uveal layer in the eye), dyspnoea (shortness of breath), arthralgia (joint pains), lupus pernio (a red <b>skin</b> <b>rash,</b> usually of the face), erythema nodosum (red skin lumps, usually on the shins), {{and symptoms of}} liver involvement (jaundice) or heart involvement (heart failure).|$|E
25|$|Maize {{contains}} lipid transfer protein, an indigestible {{protein that}} survives cooking. This protein {{has been linked}} to a rare and understudied allergy to maize in humans. The allergic reaction can cause <b>skin</b> <b>rash,</b> swelling or itching of mucous membranes, diarrhea, vomiting, asthma and, in severe cases, anaphylaxis. It is unclear how common this allergy is in the general population.|$|E
50|$|It {{can also}} cause serious {{hypersensitivity}} reactions include anaphylactic shock, urticaria, serious <b>skin</b> <b>rashes,</b> including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, facial edema, bronchospasm, granulomatous hepatitis, and itchiness.|$|R
50|$|Eperisone is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} with known hypersensitivity to the drug.Side effects: 'very rare' excessive relaxation, stomachache, nausea, vertigo, anorexia, drowsiness, <b>skin</b> <b>rashes,</b> diarrhoea, vomiting, indigestion, GI disturbances, insomnia, headache, constipation etc.|$|R
5|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} a type of {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Signs and symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss. Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include anemia, <b>skin</b> <b>rashes,</b> arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and tiredness. The <b>skin</b> <b>rashes</b> may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction also commonly occurs and those with the disease are at greater risk of bowel cancer.|$|R
25|$|Inherited {{metabolic}} disorders {{characterized by}} deficient activities of biotin-dependent carboxylases are termed multiple carboxylase deficiency. These include {{deficiencies in the}} enzymes holocarboxylase synthetase or biotinidase. Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency prevents the body's cells from using biotin effectively, and thus interferes with multiple carboxylase reactions. Biochemical and clinical manifestations include: ketolactic acidosis, organic aciduria, hyperammonemia, <b>skin</b> <b>rash,</b> feeding problems, hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay, alopecia, and coma.|$|E
25|$|Possible {{side effects}} of 5-ASA include, nausea and vomiting, reduced sperm count and damage to red or white blood cells, or to the liver, kidneys, pancreas, nerves or hearing. Allergic {{reactions}} to sulfasalazine characterized by dizziness, fever and <b>skin</b> <b>rash</b> {{have been reported in}} a small percentage of patients. In some cases, sulfasalazine can exacerbate ulcerative colitis resulting in diarahea, abdominal cramps and discomfort.|$|E
25|$|Biotin {{deficiency}} can {{be caused}} by inadequate dietary intake or inheritance of one or more inborn genetic disorders that affect biotin metabolism. Subclinical deficiency can cause mild symptoms, such as hair thinning or <b>skin</b> <b>rash</b> typically on the face. Neonatal screening for biotinidase deficiency began in the United States in 1984 and today many countries test for this disorder at birth. Individuals born prior to 1984 are unlikely to have been screened, thus the true prevalence of the disorder is unknown.|$|E
