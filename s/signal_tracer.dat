Their largest secondary market was audio equipment. EICO produced amateur radio equipment often in kit form, such as the EICO 720 and 730 transmitters. Later in the 1960s they made the EICO 753 SSB transceiver for amateur radio use.

An electrochemical ELISA system was constructed using anti-AFP antibodies immobilized on microwell plates as the capture antibody (Ab 1) and multi-label bioconjugates as <b>signal</b> <b>tracer.</b> The bioconjugates were synthesized by attaching glucoamylase and the secondary anti-AFP antibodies (Ab 2) to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). After formation of the sandwich complex, the Ab 2 -glucoamylase-AuNPs conjugates converted starch into glucose in the presence of AFP. The concentration of AFP can be calculated based on the linear relation between AFP and glucose, the concentration of which can be detected by the glucose biosensor.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate and optimize spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) MR sequences for the use of gadolinium (Gd-DTPA) as a kinetic tracer. Methods. Water-gadolinium phantoms were constructed for a physiologic range of gadolinium concentrations. Observed and calculated SPGR signal to concentration curves were generated. Using a percentage error determination, optimal pulse parameters for signal to concentration mapping were obtained. Results. The accuracy of the SPGR equation is a function of the chosen MR pulse parameters, particularly the time to repetition (TR) and the flip angle (FA). At all experimental values of TR, increasing FA decreases the ratio between observed and calculated signals. Conversely, for a constant FA, increasing TR increases this ratio. Using optimized pulse parameter sets, it is possible to achieve excellent accuracy (approximately 5 %) over a physiologic range of concentration tracer concentrations. Conclusion. Optimal pulse parameter sets exist and their use is essential for deriving accurate signal to concentration curves in quantitative MRI...|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} {{of a range}} of <b>tracer</b> <b>signals</b> in a simple model of the deep western boundary current is examined. Analytical expressions are derived in certain limits for the transit-time distributions and the propagation times (tracer ages) of tracers with exponentially growing or periodic concentration histories at the boundary current’s origin. If mixing between the boundary current and the surrounding ocean is either very slow or very rapid, then all <b>tracer</b> <b>signals</b> propagate at the same rate. In contrast, for intermediate mixing rates tracer ages generally depend {{on the history of the}} tracer variations at the origin and range from the advective time along the current to the much larger mean age. Close agreement of the model with chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and tritium observations in the North Atlantic deep western boundary current (DWBC) is obtained when the model is in the intermediate mixing regime, with current speed around 5 cm s 1 and mixing time scale around 1 yr. In this regime anomalies in temperature and salinity of decadal or shorter period will propagate downstream at roughly the current speed, which is much faster than the spreading rate inferred from CFC or tritium–helium ages (approximately 5 cm s 1 as compared with 2 cm s 1). This rapid {{propagation of}} anomalies is consistent with observations in the subpolar DWBC, but is at odds with inferences from measurements in the tropical DWBC. This suggests that observed tropical temperature and salinity anomalies are not simply propagated signals from the north. The sensitivity of the tracer spreading rates to tracer and mixing time scales in the model suggests that tight constraints on the flow and transport in real DWBCs may be obtained from simultaneous measurements of several different tracers—in particular, hydrographic anomalies and steadily increasing transient tracers. 1...|$|R

40|$|This report {{covers the}} fiscal year 1999 portion of our ongoing project to develop tracer {{spectral}} diagnostics of ablator conditions in the hohlraum radiation environment. The overall goal of the experimental campaign is to measure the turn-on times of K{sub a} absorption features from tracers buried in planar witness plates. The tracers are thin and at a specific, known depth in the witness plates so that the turn-on times are indicators of {{the arrival of the}} Marshak wave at the specified depths. Ultimately, we intend to compare the delay in the turn-on times of the <b>tracer</b> <b>signals</b> between doped and undoped ablator materials, and thus study the effect of ablator dopants on the Marshak wave velocity. During FY 1999, our primary goal was to simply measure an absorption <b>signal,</b> matching <b>tracer</b> depth to drive temperature and testing the overall feasibility of our experimental scheme. In indirect-drive inertial confinement fusion (ICF) energy is deposited rapidly on the outside of a spherical capsule, ablating the outer layers of the capsule and compressing the interior. If this process is carefully controlled, then hydrogen fuel {{at the center of the}} capsule can be compressed and heated such that fusion reactions may proceed. The efficiency of the compression depends crucially on the time-dependent energy deposition onto the ablator material on the outside of the capsule. The nature of this coupling can be controlled through the use of ablator dopants, which modify the density and opacity of the ablator layer. Clearly, it is crucial to the success of indirect-drive ICF to have a means for testing the effects of ablator dopants, and more generally for having a diagnostic that is capable of determining time-dependent ablator properties. To this end, we are adapting tracer spectroscopy techniques to make time-dependent measurements of the ionization state of planar ablator materials mounted on the sides of hohlraums. Specifically, we are doing backlighter point-projection spectroscopy of K{sub a} features from tracers placed in the interiors of planar witness plates made of ablator materials. As the radiation wave, or Marshak wave, diffuses into the ablator material it drives a shock ahead of it. When the shock arrives at a given point in the witness plate it heats the tracer to roughly 20 eV. Soon after, the radiation wave arrives, heating the tracer to well above 100 eV nearly instantaneously. Thus, the ''turn-on'' of tracer absorption from high ionization states is an indicator that the radiation wave has arrived at the tracer. Furthermore, the time-dependent ionization balance in the tracer is, our simulations show, indicative of the efficiency with which the radiation field couples to the ablator material. Note that this technique holds out the possibility of making a determination of the instantaneous impact of the radiation field on the ablator physics, as opposed to something like a shock breakout measurement, in which the observed signal reflects the integrated time-history of the impact of the radiation field on the ablator...|$|R

Analytical solutions have been developed for tracer transport in both single-fracture and multiple-fracture systems associated with these reactions under transient and steady-state transport conditions. These solutions also take into account advective transport in fractures and molecular diffusion in the rock matrix. For studying distributions of disturbed tracer concentration (the difference between actual concentration and its equilibrium value), effects of precipitation-dissolution {{reactions are}} mathematically equivalent to a 'decay' process with a decay constant proportional to the corresponding bulk reaction rate. This important feature significantly simplifies the derivation procedure by taking advantage of the existence of analytical solutions for tracer transport associated with radioactive decay in fractured rock. It is also useful for interpreting tracer breakthrough curves, because the impact of a decay process is relatively easy to analyze.

The BVP models the displacement of water by another aqueous solution with a different density in a rectangular, vertical cross section of a homogeneous porous medium. A rectangular sandbox analog model was used to verify the validity of the nondimensional solution for the case of a moving interface during the displacement of water by a heavier-than-water aqueous solution. A constant flow rate was maintained by applying constant heads at a fully penetrating vertical inflow and outflow chamber. The theory, which can be applied as a prediction tool for laboratory experiments, permits us to explore the implications of using denser-than-water tracers for determining aquifer hydraulic conductivity and dispersion coefficient values.

For analysing the bubble swarm behaviour and simultaneously evaluating the flow structure and bubble-induced turbulence in a bubble column of 140 mm diameter and a height of 650 mm (initial water level) Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was applied. The bubble column was aerated with relatively fine bubbles with a size distribution between about 0. 3 and 4. 0 mm. The gas hold-up was varied in the range between 0. 5 and 4 %. A two-phase PIV-system was developed to evaluate instantaneous flow fields of both rising bubbles and the continuous phase (Fig. 1). The measurement of the liquid velocities in the bubble swarm was done by adding fluorescing seed particles. Images of bubbles and fluorescing tracer particles were acquired by two CCD cameras. The <b>signals</b> from <b>tracers</b> and bubbles were separated by optical interference filters with a band width corresponding to the emitting wavelength of the fluorescing tracer particles and the wavelengths of the applied Nd-YAG pulsed laser.

In wild-type mice at all ages, there was neither aortic thickening nor targeted <b>tracer</b> <b>signal</b> enhancement. In DKO mice, lesions progressed from sparse mild intimal thickening at 10 weeks to widespread severe lesions with luminal encroachment at 40 weeks. Molecular imaging for P-selectin and VCAM- 1 demonstrated selective signal enhancement (P> 0. 01 versus nontargeted agent) at all ages for DKO mice. P-selectin and VCAM- 1 signal in DKO mice were greater by 3 -fold at 10 weeks, 4 - to 6 -fold at 20 weeks, and 9 - to 10 -fold at 40 weeks compared to wild-type mice. En face microscopy demonstrated preferential attachment of targeted microbubbles to regions of lesion formation. CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive ultrasound molecular imaging of endothelial activation can detect lesion-prone vascular phenotype before the appearance of obstructive atherosclerotic lesions...|$|R
