5|$|Decompression <b>sickness</b> <b>and</b> {{arterial}} gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated}} with certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression <b>sickness</b> <b>and</b> arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Previous {{research}} on the association between adjustment latitude (defined as the opportunity to adjust work efforts in case of illness) <b>and</b> <b>sickness</b> absence <b>and</b> <b>sickness</b> presence has produced inconsistent results. In particular, low adjustment latitude {{has been identified as}} both a risk factor and a deterrent of sick leave. The present study uses an alternative analytical strategy with the aim of joining these results together. Material and Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, a random sample of employees covered by the Upper Austrian Sickness Fund (N = 930) was analyzed. Logistic and ordinary least square (OLS) regression models were used to examine the association between adjustment latitude <b>and</b> days of <b>sickness</b> absence, <b>sickness</b> presence, <b>and</b> an estimator for the individual <b>sickness</b> absence <b>and</b> <b>sickness</b> presence propensity. Results: A high level of adjustment latitude was found to be associated with a reduced number of days of <b>sickness</b> absence <b>and</b> <b>sickness</b> presence, but an elevated propensity for sickness absence. Conclusions: Employees with high adjustment latitude experience fewer days of health complaints associated with lower rates of sick leave <b>and</b> <b>sickness</b> presence compared to those with low adjustment latitude. In case of illness, however, high adjustment latitude is associated with a higher pro­bability of taking sick leave rather than sickness presence...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether {{organizational}} justice lowers productivity loss <b>and</b> <b>sickness</b> absence, <b>and</b> whether there are reverse effects of productivity loss <b>and</b> <b>sickness</b> absence on organizational justice. METHOD: A longitudinal study with 2 years of follow-up was conducted among employed persons aged 45 - 64 years from the Study on Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation (STREAM). Participants (N[*]=[*] 7011) yearly filled out an online questionnaire. Structural equation modeling in LISREL was conducted to assess the longitudinal relationships between distributive justice of salary, distributive justice of appreciation, procedural justice, productivity loss, <b>and</b> <b>sickness</b> absence. RESULTS: Both distributive justice of appreciation and procedural justice contributed to lower productivity loss <b>and</b> lower <b>sickness</b> absence at 1 -year follow-up. Productivity loss increased perceptions of distributive justice of appreciation at 1 -year follow-up, whereas sickness absence lowered both perceptions of distributive justice of appreciation and procedural justice at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Improving organizational justice lowers the risk of productivity loss <b>and</b> <b>sickness</b> absence <b>and</b> may be a useful tool to improve the productivity of organizations...|$|R

5|$|A {{procedure}} {{for dealing with}} omitted decompression stops is described in the US Navy Diving Manual.

Divers who become symptomatic before they can be returned to depth are treated for decompression <b>sickness,</b> <b>and</b> do not attempt the omitted decompression procedure as the risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) {{is primarily}} {{caused by the}} consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates, single-celled protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters. Saxitoxin is the most virulent of these. In mild cases, PSP causes tingling, numbness, <b>sickness</b> <b>and</b> diarrhoea. In more severe cases, {{the muscles of the}} chest wall may be affected leading to paralysis and even death. In 1937, researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these phytoplankton and PSP. The biotoxin remains potent even when the shellfish are well-cooked. In the United States, there is a regulatory limit of 80µg/g of saxitoxin equivalent in shellfish meat.|$|E

5|$|The ribs {{are bound}} to the spine by {{flexible}} cartilage, which allows the ribcage to collapse rather than snap under high pressure. While sperm whales are well adapted to diving, repeated dives to great depths have long-term effects. Bones show the same pitting that signals decompression sickness in humans.

This damage may indicate that sperm whales are susceptible to decompression <b>sickness,</b> <b>and</b> sudden surfacing could be lethal to them.|$|E
