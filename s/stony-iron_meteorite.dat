2500|$|Opportunity Rover found meteorites {{just sitting}} on the plains. [...] The first one {{analyzed}} with Opportunity's instruments was called [...] "Heatshield Rock," [...] as it was found near where Opportunity's heatshield landed. [...] Examination with the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES), Mossbauer spectrometer, and APXS lead researchers to, classify it as an IAB meteorite. [...] The APXS determined it was composed of 93% iron and 7% nickel. [...] The cobble named [...] "Fig Tree Barberton" [...] {{is thought to be}} a stony or <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorite</b> (mesosiderite silicate), while [...] "Allan Hills," [...] and [...] "Zhong Shan" [...] may be iron meteorites.|$|E

50|$|It is a <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorite</b> of the Main Group Pallasite (MGP) group.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites</b> {{constitute}} the remaining 1%. They are {{a mixture of}} iron-nickel metal and silicate minerals. One type, called pallasites, {{is thought to have}} originated in the boundary zone above the core regions where iron meteorites originated. The other major type of <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites</b> is the mesosiderites.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites</b> are all differentiated, {{meaning that}} they show signs of alteration. They are {{therefore}} achondrites.|$|R
40|$|Asteroidal material, {{delivered}} to Earth as meteorites, preserves {{a record of}} the earliest stages of planetary formation. High-precision oxygen isotope analyses for the two major groups of <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites</b> (main-group pallasites and mesosiderites) demonstrate that each group is from a distinct asteroidal source. Mesosiderites are isotopically identical to the howardite-eucrite-diogenite clan and, like them, are probably derived from the asteroid 4 Vesta. Main-group pallasites represent intermixed core-mantle material from a single disrupted asteroid and have no known equivalents among the basaltic <b>meteorites.</b> The <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites</b> demonstrate that intense asteroidal deformation accompanied planetary accretion in the early Solar System...|$|R
50|$|The Vermillion {{meteorite}} is a pallasite (<b>stony-iron)</b> <b>meteorite</b> {{and one of}} {{two members}} of the pyroxene pallasite grouplet.|$|E
50|$|Łowicz is an <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorite</b> (mesosiderite) {{which fell}} on 12 March 1935 at 0:50 {{in the area}} of Krępa Rzeczyce and Wrzeczko villages, south of Łowicz. Numerous {{specimens}} were recovered.|$|E
50|$|Itqiy is a <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorite</b> {{consisting}} of 78% enstatite and 22% meteoric iron. The meteoric iron is kamacite with 5.77% nickel. Small amounts of other minerals include troilite, Mg-Mn-Fe sulfides and Fe-Cr sulfides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites</b> or siderolites are meteorites that {{consist of}} nearly equal parts of {{meteoric}} iron and silicates. This distinguishes {{them from the}} stony meteorites, that are mostly silicates, and the iron meteorites, that are mostly meteoric iron.|$|R
25|$|Most meteorites are stony meteorites, classed as chondrites and achondrites. Only about 6% of meteorites are iron meteorites or a {{blend of}} rock and metal, the <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites.</b> Modern {{classification}} of meteorites is complex. The review paper of Krot et al. (2007) summarizes modern meteorite taxonomy.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} these <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites</b> formed when a 50 - 150 km {{diameter}} projectile disrupted a 200 - 400 km diameter asteroid with a molten core. Several mineralogical features of mesosiderites need reinterpreting if our model is correct. Additional information {{is contained in}} the original extended abstract...|$|R
50|$|Brenham is a pallasite {{meteorite}} {{found near}} Haviland, {{a small town}} in Kiowa County, Kansas, United States. Pallasites are a type of <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorite</b> that when cut and polished show yellowish olivine (peridot) crystals.|$|E
50|$|The settlement's {{name was}} used to {{identify}} a huge olivine bearing <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorite</b> of over 800 pounds, called the Seymchan meteorite, which was discovered {{in the bed of}} a brook in the summer of 1967.|$|E
50|$|The Fukang {{meteorite}} is {{a meteorite}} {{that was found}} in the mountains near Fukang, China in 2000. It is a pallasite—a type of <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorite</b> with olivine crystals. It is estimated to be 4.5 billion years old.|$|E
50|$|The cores {{of planets}} are inaccessible, studied {{indirectly}} by seismometry, gravimetry, {{and in some}} cases magnetometry. However, iron and <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites</b> are likely fragments from the cores of parent bodies which have partially or completely differentiated, then shattered. These meteorites are thus the only means of directly examining deep-interior materials and their processes.|$|R
40|$|The (still largely incomplete) shock {{histories}} of 18 <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites</b> (classified as mesosiderites) are studied.

50|$|Mesosiderites are a {{class of}} <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites</b> {{consisting}} of about equal parts of metallic nickel-iron and silicate. They are breccias with an irregular texture; silicates and metal occur often in lumps or pebbles {{as well as in}} fine-grained intergrowths.

50|$|Peter Pallas was {{a famous}} naturalist {{who took part in}} the {{discovery}} and the study of the first pallasite, a type of <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorite</b> named after him. Coincidentally, Pallasovka is a pallasite meteorite found near the town and named after it.|$|E
40|$|Sixty-four chondrites (14 H, 25 L, 17 LL and 8 C), 32 achondrites and 2 rare <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites</b> from Antarctica were {{analyzed}} by standard wet chemical analysis method. In the present paper the analyses of the chondrites and the <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites</b> are reported. Many Antarctic meteorites {{are more or less}} weathered or oxidized. Analyses of fresh and weathered parts of three chondrites indicate that abundances of most major elements are essentially the same between the two parts except for the proportions of Fe, FeO and Fe_ 2 O_ 3. The analyses of the chondrites show that H chondrites and L and LL chondrites are distinct in several components (e. g., Na_ 2 O is separated at 0. 85 wt%). When iron and FeS are subtracted, however, all the ordinary chondrites have essentially the same compositions, although H chondrites are slightly higher in Mg and lower in Si than L and LL chondrites. The compositions of the eight carbonaceous chondrites indicate that they comprise both C 2 and C 3 types in equal number. The analyzed carbonaceous chondrites are distinctly lower in SiO_ 2,Na_ 2 O and K_ 2 O and higher in MgO, Al_ 2 O_ 3 and CaO than the ordinary chondrites. The <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites</b> analyzed are similar to lodranite; however, one differs from lodranite in SiO_ 2,Al_ 2 O_ 3 and CaO, and the other differs in SiO_ 2 and Fe/Mg ratio...|$|R
40|$|Use of {{metallographic}} and X-ray diffraction {{techniques to}} study the shock histories of 119 iron and <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites,</b> and measurement of the hardness of kamacite in these specimens and in artificially shocked-unannealed and annealed meteorite specimens. Shock increases kamacite hardness, but complications introduced by other {{physical and chemical properties}} of meteorites limit its utility as a shock indicator. About 50 % of the meteorites studied show evidence for preterrestrial shock loading to pressures of {{greater than or equal to}} 130 kb, and 40 % have not been shocked to such high pressures. The remaining meteorites have been heat-altered in such a way that their shock histories cannot be determined explicitly. These results, together with those obtained previously, indicate that the plurality, if not the majority, of all iron and <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites</b> sampled by the earth were shocked to pressures of greater than or equal to 130 kb during preterrestrial collisions between asteroidal-sized objects...|$|R

50|$|The town of Pallasovka {{was named}} after Peter Pallas (1741-1811), a famous naturalist {{who took part in}} the {{discovery}} and the study of the first pallasite, a type of <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorite</b> named after him. Coincidentally, Pallasovka is a pallasite meteorite named after a town named after the discoverer of pallasites.|$|E
50|$|In 1772, Pallas {{was shown}} a 680-kg lump of metal {{that had been}} found near Krasnoyarsk. Pallas {{arranged}} {{for it to be}} transported to St Petersburg. Subsequent analysis of the metal showed it to be a new type of <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorite.</b> This new type of meteorite was called pallasite after him; the meteorite itself is named Krasnojarsk or sometimes Pallas Iron (the name given to it by Ernst Chladni in 1794).|$|E

50|$|Modern {{meteorite}} classification was {{worked out}} in the 1860s, based on Gustav Rose's and Nevil Story Maskelyne's classifications. Gustav Rose worked on the meteorite collection of the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin and Maskelyne on {{the collection of the}} British Museum, London. Rose was the first to make different categories for meteorites with chondrules (chondrites) and without (nonchondrites). Story-Maskelyne differentiated between siderites, siderolites and aerolites (now called iron <b>meteorites,</b> <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites</b> and stony meteorite, respectively).|$|R

5000|$|Dalgaranga crater {{is a small}} {{meteorite}} impact crater located on Dalgaranga pastoral station 75 km west of Mount Magnet (or north of Yalgoo) in Western Australia. It is only 24 m in diameter and 3 m deep, making it Australia's smallest impact crater (with exception of the smallest members of the Henbury crater field). Though discovered in 1921, it was not reported in the scientific literature until 1938. The bedrock at the site is weathered Archaean granite of the Yilgarn Craton. The discovery of fragments of mesosiderite <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorite</b> around the crater confirms an impact origin, making this crater unique as the only one {{known to have been}} produced by a mesosiderite projectile. Asymmetries in the crater structure and the ejecta blanket imply that the projectile impacted at low angle from the south-southeast. The age is not accurately constrained but must be young because it is so well preserved for its small size, and the meteorite fragments have not weathered away; some authors suggest an age of as young as 3000 years.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} results of {{broadband}} visual and infrared photometry of the Apollo-Amor asteroid 1943 Anteros during its 1980 apparition. By means of a radiometric model, we calculate a diameter of 2. 3 ± 0. 2 km and a visual geometric albedo of 0. 13 ± 0. 03. The albedo and reflectance spectrum of Anteros imply {{that it is a}} type S asteroid. Thus, Anteros may have a silicate surface similar to other Apollo-Amor asteroids as well as some <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites...</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>stony-iron</b> <b>meteorites</b> Bencubbin and Weatherford contain {{nitrogen}} with a {{ratio of}} nitrogen- 15 to nitrogen- 14 larger than normal {{by as much as}} a factor of 2. The excess nitrogen- 15 may be due either to a nucleosynthetic origin or to extreme isotopic fractionation.
