25|$|The most {{important}} of feathers in central Mexico were the long green feathers of the resplendent quetzal which were reserved for deities and the emperor. One reason for their rarity was that quetzals could not be domesticated as they died in captivity. Instead wild birds were caught, plucked and released. Other tropical birds were used as well. Bernardino de Sahagún {{made a list of}} the species used for fine feathers, many of which are now either threatened or locally extinct. These include the mountain trogon, lovely cotinga, roseate spoonbill, <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> red-legged honeycreeper, emerald toucanet, agami heron, russet-crowned motmot, turquoise-browed motmot, blue grosbeak, golden eagle, great egret, military macaw, scarlet macaw, yellow-headed amazon, Montezuma oropendola and the over 53 species of hummingbird found in Mexico.|$|E
50|$|P. melanogaster {{is often}} {{confused}} with the <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Piaya cayana) because both species share the same habitat. The <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo</b> is more frequently observed in the canopy. They differ because P. cayana is seen more frequently in the canopy forest of firm land; also because the <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo</b> has exposed yellow-greenish skin in the orbital area, the chest plumage is grey and it lacks the characteristic hood of the black-bellied cuckoo.|$|E
50|$|The genus Playa is {{considered}} paraphyletic. The little cuckoo (P. minuta) doesn't cluster with the <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo</b> and the black-bellied cuckoo, {{as it was}} traditionally classified.|$|E

50|$|It {{feeds on}} large insects such as cicadas, wasps and {{caterpillars}} (including those with stinging hairs or spines), and occasionally spiders and small lizards, rarely taking fruit. Its static prey is typically {{taken off the}} foliage with a quick lunge, but wasps may be picked out of the air. <b>Squirrel</b> <b>cuckoos</b> are often observed to forage peacefully alongside small mammals such as common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) {{during the dry season}} for cocoa beans. In particular, they can be seen to attend army ant columns together, picking off prey flushed by the ants, and occasionally will join mixed-species feeding flocks.|$|R
40|$|Centrorhynchus microcephalus (Bravo-Hollis, 1947) Golvan, 1956 (Acanthocephala: Centrorhynchidae) {{originally}} {{was described as}} Gordiorhynchus microcephalus Bravo-Hollis, 1947 {{on the basis of}} 8 worms collected from the small intestine of a single great-tailed grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus) from the state of Puebla, Mexico. Acquisition of 48 specimens collected from the groove-billed ani (Crotophaga sulcirostris) in Tlacotalpan, Veracruz, Mexico permitted a more complete description of the species. Nine of 10 (90 %) birds examined were infected with 2 – 13 individuals of Centrorhynchus microcephalus with a mean intensity of 5. 3. Examination of the type material of Centrorhynchus crotophagicola Schmidt and Neiland, 1966 revealed this species, described from groove-billed anis and <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoos</b> (Piaya cayana) from Nicaragua, to be conspecific with C. microcephalus...|$|R

50|$|The <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo</b> {{is found}} in {{woodland}} canopy and edges, second growth, hedges and semi-open habitats from sea level to as high as 2500 m, although it is uncommon above 1200 m.|$|E
50|$|The <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Piaya cayana) is a {{large and}} active species of cuckoo found in wooded {{habitats}} from northwestern Mexico to northern Argentina and Uruguay, and on Trinidad. Some authorities have split off the western Mexican form as the Mexican squirrel-cuckoo (Piaya mexicana).|$|E
50|$|These are vocal {{species with}} {{persistent}} and loud calls. They feed on large insects such as cicadas, wasps and caterpillars (including those with stinging hairs or spines which are distasteful to many birds). <b>Squirrel</b> and black-bellied <b>cuckoos</b> {{are large and}} powerful species, and occasionally take vertebrate prey such as small lizards.|$|R
50|$|Os Tincoãs were a Brazilian {{popular music}} band from Bahia, {{primarily}} {{active in the}} 1960s and 1970s. They are named after the Tincoã bird, a subspecies of the <b>Squirrel</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> native to Brazil. Surviving member Mateus Aleluia is still very active in singing and songwriting.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the thousands of}} varieties of insects like Trosia Dimas and Lonomia Obliqua, there are over a hundred species of indigenous birds that occupy the grounds of AkahtiLândia such as the Green-headed tanager, Green-billed toucan, <b>Squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> Brazilian tanager, Blue-and-yellow tanager. White-tailed trogon, the Blue-winged parrotlet, etc.|$|E
50|$|The <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo</b> is {{plentiful}} {{in most of}} {{its range}} {{and appears to be}} quite tolerant of human disturbance, as long as wooded land remains. Compared to many cuckoos in the world, it is relatively bold and conspicuous, although it most often encountered skulking about within vegetation. Owing to its wide range, it is considered a species of Least Concern by the IUCN.|$|E
50|$|Other birds {{observed}} in the park include the rufous-tailed jacamar (Galbula ruficauda), <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Piaya cayana), southern beardless tyrannulet (Camptostoma obsoletum), purple-throated euphonia (Euphonia chlorotica), grey-headed tanager (Eucometis penicillata), barred antshrike (Thamnophilus doliatus), pale-breasted thrush (Turdus leucomelas), toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), white-throated spadebill (Platyrinchus mystaceus), sepia-capped flycatcher (Leptopogon amaurocephalus), silver-beaked tanager (Ramphocelus carbo), planalto tyrannulet (Phyllomyias fasciatus), bananaquit (Coereba flaveola) and red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus).|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} about 27 cm long and weighs 40 g. The adult is mainly {{chestnut}} brown, with a greyish lower belly, browner tail and white tips to the tail feathers. The bill is yellow, short, and decurved; the iris {{of the eyes}} is red. Immature birds are dark brown with a black bill and no white tail tips. It is smaller and the throat is darker than in the <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{black-bellied cuckoo}} or black-bellied <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Piaya melanogaster) is a bird {{of the family}} Cuculidae found in the Amazon region. The genus Playa is {{considered}} part of the cuckoos of the New World. Even though this species has a wide distribution, little is known about its ecology and natural history. This species is considered as monotypic. The word melanogaster means [...] "black belly"; it has Greek roots, melas meaning [...] "black" [...] and gaster meaning [...] "belly".|$|E
50|$|These {{birds are}} birds with {{relatively}} slender bodies, long tails and strong legs. The black-bellied cuckoo is essentially restricted to rainforest, {{but the more}} widespread <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo</b> also occurs in other forest types, woodlands or mangroves. Piaya cuckoos, unlike many Old World species, are not brood parasites; they build their own nests in trees and lay two eggs. Parasitic cuckoos lay coloured eggs to match those of their passerine hosts, but the non-parasitic Piaya species, like most other non-passerines, lay white eggs.|$|E
50|$|The ESEC is {{an urban}} {{conservation}} area of 114 ha holding typical semi-deciduous forest and cerrado vegetation.It has very diverse flora and fauna, including mammals such as capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), black-tufted marmoset (Callithrix penicillata) and opossum (Didelphis), {{amphibians and reptiles}} such as Tupinambis lizards and False coral snakes, and about 150 species of birds including <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Piaya cayana), toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), Penelope, Saíra and cinnamon tanager (Schistochlamys ruficapillus).Vegetation includes native species such as Guazuma ulmifolia (Mutamba), Cedar, Ipê, Cotieira and exotic species such as Eucalyptus, Mango (Mangifera indica) and Baobab (Adansonia).|$|E

50|$|The {{guira cuckoo}} is a bird of open {{habitats}} and therefore {{has expanded its}} range on human-altered wooded areas, being found even in suburban parks and gardens. It feeds on large arthropods, frogs, eggs, small birds (especially nestlings) and small mammals such as mice. As {{it is not an}} accomplished flier, mostly gliding or hopping from one perch to another - clumsier, but otherwise similar to the related <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo</b> - it acts as an opportunistic predator, gathering small prey items on the ground or searching for them among branches. The guira cuckoo is often seen in small groups in open habitats, gliding from one treetop to another foraging, while vocalizating loudly. The bird's call is unmistakable for being long and shrill, something between a long whistle and a wailing.|$|E
50|$|The {{feathers}} {{of the piece}} have deteriorated over the centuries. It is 116 cm high and 175 cm across and has the form of concentric layers of different colored feathers arranged in a semicircle. The smallest is made from blue {{feathers of}} the Cotinga amabilis (xiuhtōtōtl) with small plates of gold in the shapes of half moons. Behind this is a layer of Roseate spoonbill (tlāuhquechōlli) feathers, then small quetzal feathers, then a layer of white-tipped red-brown feathers of the <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> Piaya cayana, with three bands of small gold plates, and finally two of 400 closely spaced quetzal tail feathers, some 55 cm long. The quetzal feathers {{in the center of}} the headdress are raised relative to the sides. Leather straps attach the crown to the head of the wearer.|$|E
50|$|Gnateaters are {{notable for}} their absence from these flocks, while swifts and {{swallows}} rarely join them, but will {{if there is}} for example an ant or termite swarm. Cotingidae (cotingas) are mainly opportunistic associates which rarely join flocks for long if they do so at all; {{the same holds true}} for most Muscicapoidea (mockingbirds and relatives), though some thrushes may participate on more often. And though most Tityridae rarely join mixed flocks, becards do so regularly. Tapaculos are rarely seen with mixed flocks, though the collared crescentchest, doubtfully assigned to that family, may be a regular member. Icteridae (grackles and relatives) are also not too often seen to take part in these assemblages, though caciques like the golden-winged or red-rumped cacique join mixed flocks on a somewhat more regular basis. Cuculiformes (cuckoos and allies) are usually absent from mixed feeding flocks, but some - for example, the <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo</b> - can be encountered not infrequently.|$|E
50|$|The park {{is popular}} with birdwatchers {{due to its}} {{abundance}} of bird species; some 525 bird species are found here. Pipeline Road extends for 17.5 km north-south through the park and passes through old-growth and secondary forest. Pipeline Road {{is one of the}} best places to see tropical birds in the Americas, with a bird species list exceeding 400. Birds regularly seen along Pipeline Road include double-toothed kite, slaty-backed forest-falcon, orange-chinned parakeet, brown-hooded parrot, blue-headed parrot, red-lored parrot, <b>squirrel</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> white-necked jacobin, violet-bellied hummingbird, crowned woodnymph, blue-chested hummingbird, white-tailed trogon, gartered trogon, black-throated trogon, black-tailed trogon, slaty-tailed trogon, black-mandibled toucan, keel-billed toucan, collared aracari, black-cheeked woodpecker, cinnamon woodpecker, crimson-crested woodpecker, white-whiskered puffbird, broad-billed motmot, rufous motmot, northern barred woodcreeper, cocoa woodcreeper, black-striped woodcreeper, fasciated antshrike, black-crowned antshrike, checker-throated antwren, dot-winged antwren, white-flanked antwren, spotted antbird, bicolored antbird, ocellated antbird, chestnut-backed antbird, black-faced antthrush, southern bentbill, brownish twistwing, olivaceous flatbill, ruddy-tailed flycatcher, bright-rumped attila, purple-throated fruitcrow, red-capped manakin, blue-crowned manakin, golden-collared manakin, bay wren, song wren, gray-headed tanager, white-shouldered tanager, red-throated ant-tanager, blue-black grosbeak, scarlet-rumped cacique, and yellow-rumped cacique.|$|E
