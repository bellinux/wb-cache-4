[...] said Aunt Keziah, taking a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> beloved liquid, and {{grinning}} {{at him with a}} face and eyes as yellow as that she was drinking. In fact the idea struck him, that in temper, and all appreciable qualities, Aunt Keziah was a good deal like this drink of hers, having probably become saturated by them while she drank of it. And then, having drunk, she gloated over it, and tasted, and smelt of the cup of this hellish wine, as a winebibber does of that which is most fragrant and delicate. [...] "And {{you want to know how}} I make it? But first, child, tell me honestly, do you love this drink of mine? Otherwise, here, and at once, we stop talking about it." ...|$|E
60|$|She said 'Perhaps' {{between the}} <b>sips</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> coffee. And the sound <b>of</b> <b>her</b> taking her breath in the word, was nauseous to him. He rose quickly {{to be away}} from her.|$|R
60|$|For {{some time}} Mrs. Crupp could only lay her hand upon her nankeen bosom, and fortify herself against {{returning}} pain with <b>sips</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> medicine. At length she spoke again.|$|R

60|$|Sam {{understood}} all this, of course, {{so he said}} at once, that {{he never}} could drink before supper, unless a lady drank with him. A great deal of laughter ensued, and Mrs. Sanders volunteered to humour him, so she took a slight <b>sip</b> out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> glass. Then Sam said it must go all round, so they all took a slight sip. Then little Mrs. Cluppins proposed as a toast, 'Success to Bardell agin Pickwick'; and then the ladies emptied their glasses in honour of the sentiment, and got very talkative directly.|$|R
60|$|Julien {{turned his}} head half unwillingly. The girl was leaning across the table, her eyes fixed steadfastly upon his. Her lips were parted, her eyebrows were {{slightly}} raised, as though in question. She had been holding a menu before her face to shield her from the casual observer, but the moment Julien {{turned his head}} she lowered it. He inclined his head slowly. A curious expression of relief took the place of that appearance <b>of</b> strained anxiety. <b>Her</b> face became natural once more. She laid down the menu and took a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> wine from <b>her</b> glass. Kendricks looked across at Julien and raised his glass to his lips.|$|R
50|$|Guddu Bahadur (Shah Rukh Khan) is {{the only}} child in the Bahadur family, {{consisting}} of Advocate Vikram (Mukesh Khanna) and his wife, Kavita (Deepti Naval). While Kavita is a devout and a religious Hindu, Vikram is an atheist. Guddu and Salina Gupta (Manisha Koirala) are in love. One day while driving, they have an accident and Salina loses her sight. Guddu blames himself and so do Salina's parents. Guddu is asked to keep away from Salina. Salina herself knows that the accident was not Guddu's fault, but {{would not like to}} meet Guddu and be a burden on him. Guddu overhears a conversation between their family doctor and his dad and he comes to know that he has brain tumor. He has only a few more months to live. He wants to donate his eyes to the hospital so Salina can benefit from them, but his dad will not even consider this. Things take a turn for the worse, when Guddu decides to go to court to assert his right to donate his eyes, his dad ends in the hospital and so does Guddu. Kavita couldn't bear the trauma <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband's illness and her son's disease, thus she decides to devote herself to god for five days without drinking a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> water. <b>Her</b> prayers get answered and her husband's life is saved and her son's operation is successful. She dies in the feet of god while praying and her eyes get donated to Salina. Salina and Guddu get married and are blessed with twins and they live happily ever after.|$|R

60|$|However, that's neither here nor there, just now. She {{went home}} to breakfast, and had {{scarcely}} caught the full flavour <b>of</b> <b>her</b> first <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> tea, when the servant announced a gentleman, whereat Miss La Creevy, at once imagining a new sitter transfixed by admiration at the street-door case, was in unspeakable consternation at {{the presence of the}} tea-things.|$|R
60|$|There {{is nothing}} so {{troublesome}} {{as a hero}} on a small scale, or, rather, a hero in a small town. Dolph soon became the abhorrence of all drowsy, housekeeping old citizens, who hated noise, and had no relish for waggery. The good dames, too, considered him as little better than a reprobate, gathered their daughters under their wings whenever he approached, and pointed him out {{as a warning to}} their sons. No one seemed to hold him in much regard, excepting the wild striplings of the place, who were captivated by his open-hearted, daring manners, and the negroes, who always look upon every idle, do-nothing youngster as a kind of gentleman. Even the good Peter de Groodt, who had considered himself a kind of patron of the lad, began to despair of him; and would shake his head dubiously, as he listened to a long complaint from the housekeeper, and <b>sipped</b> a glass <b>of</b> <b>her</b> raspberry brandy.|$|R
