We would use the same basic inspection concept that had been prepared for July; the intelligence on both sites, I was assured by sources, was still valid but not for much longer. I would make use of some twenty-five inspectors resident in Baghdad with the monitoring groups, and I added twelve experts, {{selected on the basis of}} what the team needed for the planned inspection. I had a five-person command element fly to Bahrain with the twelve experts to train them. They were to stay in Bahrain after the training to carry out last-minute preparations and receive intelligence updates until they flew into Iraq on the same plane that would take Butler out on August 5. <b>Somehow</b> <b>it</b> all came together.

After setting off on 24 April 1916 [...] with just the barest navigational equipment, they reached South Georgia on 10 May 1916. Shackleton, in his later account of the journey, recalled Crean's tuneless singing at the tiller: [...] "He always sang when he was steering, and nobody ever discovered what the song was... but <b>somehow</b> <b>it</b> was cheerful".|$|E

She commented, [...] "My music is for the time when people want to turn out the lights, listen and escape into another world ... to dream places ... to little magical places in which the listener can participate and become involved." [...] Regarding a potential audience, Hubbard said, [...] "My music is for intelligent listeners, who don't mind if I change chords, and are willing to see what happens next." [...] Explaining why written text did not accompany the songs, Hubbard said, [...] "I wrote lots of poetry.

500|$|The phrase [...] "hail to the thief" [...] {{was used}} by anti-George W. Bush protesters during the {{controversy}} surrounding the 2000 US presidential election as a play on [...] "Hail to the Chief", the American presidential anthem. Yorke described hearing the phrase {{for the first time}} as a [...] "formative moment" [...] for the album. Radiohead chose the title partly to [...] "state the bleeding obvious... that the most powerful country on earth is run by somebody who stole an election", but also in response to [...] "the rise of doublethink and general intolerance and madness, and feeling very much like individuals were totally out of control of the situation that <b>somehow</b> <b>it</b> was a manifestation of something not really human." [...] The title also references the leak of the album before its completion. Yorke worried the title might be misconstrued as referring solely to the US election controversy, but his bandmates felt it [...] "conjured up all the nonsense and absurdity and jubilation of the times." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Love & Monsters" [...] {{is noted}} {{for having a}} divided reception. Nick Setchfield of SFX rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, noting how it [...] "finally gives Doctor Who a whole new {{vocabulary}} as a television programme." [...] He wrote, [...] "This may be Russell T Davies’s smartest, funniest script. It’s certainly the warmest, and <b>somehow</b> <b>it</b> feels like the most personal." [...] While Setchfield was {{not a fan of}} Kay, he found his performance in this episode funny. IGN's Ahsan Haque gave the episode a score of 9.5 out of 10, particularly praising the dialogue. However, he felt that some of the sadder aspects [...] "seemed out of place in {{what should have been a}} purely light-hearted comedic episode". Slant Magazine reviewer Ross Ruediger was positive towards [...] "Love & Monsters", saying that [...] "there's no reason the series can't do something this quirky and beautiful when an inspired mind conjures up such a scenario." [...] Ruediger commented on the truths of meeting other fans on the Internet and praised the depth of Jackie's character.|$|E
500|$|However, {{many critics}} were displeased with Minogue's lack of {{innovation}} on Aphrodite. Helen Clarke from MusicOMH gave the album an overall positive review and appreciated Minogue for [...] "just what she does, and <b>somehow</b> <b>it</b> works", but did mention that it [...] " [...] fails to quite hit the spot". Jon Parales from The New York Times found the album too {{similar to the}} work of Madonna, especially her studio albums Like a Virgin (1984) and Ray of Light (1998), and commented that [...] "No one's asking for reality in this (Minogue's) pop bubble — {{just a little bit more}} innovation". Kitty Empire from The Observer enjoyed the album and complimented Price for [...] "lending a sleek cohesion to the whole (album)", but opined that Aphrodite [...] " [...] lacks the depth and chutzpah of some of her rivals' efforts". Slant Magazine critic Sal Cinquemani noted it to be [...] "more stylistically coherent than the abovementioned albums" [...] and predicted that it would [...] "no doubt please longtime fans", but also criticized Price's shallow [...] "antiseptic" [...] production which he felt was not able to complement Minogue's voice.|$|E
500|$|The seventh {{track on}} the album {{comes in the form}} of another medley, this time called [...] "Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)" [...] / [...] "Housetop Celebration". Guerra noted that Carey adds some [...] "club bounce" [...] to [...] "Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)", while Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine thought that the [...] "Housetop Celebration" [...] part of the medley [...] "recycles the {{monolithic}} beat from Kurtis Blow’s instructive [...] "Christmas Rappin'." [...] "Charlie Brown Christmas" [...] is a variation of the A Charlie Brown Christmas animated musical television special. A piece of nostalgia, as described by Guerra, it also makes use of traditional religious carols. A fourth medley titled [...] "O Come All Ye Faithful" [...] / [...] "HallelujahChorus" [...] features Carey's mother, Patricia, who performs opera during the [...] "Hallelujah Chorus" [...] section. According to Bill Lamb of About.com, [...] "Here Mariah Carey is at her best as she threatens to take everything too far sonically with operatic tones, impossibly high notes, and melisma in full force, but <b>somehow</b> <b>it</b> all holds together in exhilarating fashion." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{writer of}} Rolling Stone {{described}} the video as [...] "quite a hot mess", further comparing the dancers with the {{ones from the}} video for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". The writer finished the review calling it [...] "a four-minute art-school film unworthy of her Sasha Fierceness". Jennifer Cady of E! Online commented that the video was [...] "all about being gritty and edgy, like strutting around a downtown L.A. warehouse in crazy designer fashion and chewing bubblegum. Hard-core style". Cady further described the dance in the video for [...] "Diva" [...] as [...] "way easier to learn than [...] in 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)'". However, she chose the C-3PO-inspired mannequins, the lack of Beyoncé's robot hand and the [...] "obnoxious camera work or car explosion" [...] as the worst parts of the video. Entertainment Weeklys Michael Slezak commented: [...] "The video has the production values of the clearance bin at Family Dollar, and yet <b>somehow</b> <b>it</b> works." [...] Slezak further described the set as a [...] "trunk full of mannequins, Cylon-y fringed sunglasses, and angry-lady dancing {{on display in the}} accompanying video". The video was ranked at number 13 on Black Entertainment Television's (BET's) Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E
500|$|IndieWire's Ben Travers praised Legion as [...] "the most intricate, {{intimate}} superhero {{story to}} date", highlighting {{its focus on}} [...] "an emotional journey for our leading lad", the central love story that turns the show [...] "from a 12 Monkeys mind-fuck to a Romeo & Juliet romance {{at the drop of}} a hat", and its cast. At Variety, Maureen Ryan stated that Stevens' performance [...] "is the glue that keeps Legion from flying apart", and the relationship between Haller and Barrett provides [...] "moments of solace in a viewing experience that can otherwise be exceptionally intense." [...] After the first three episodes, Ryan said that [...] "the challenge of Legion will be to make David’s quest for wholeness more than the sum of its flashy and often captivating parts. But the humane core of the drama offers a reason to hope for the best." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "It might seem weird to have a Marvel show on FX, or to have it star that upper-crust Brit from Downton Abbey, filtered through the creator of Fargo, but <b>somehow</b> <b>it</b> all works." [...] He praised Stevens performance, and Hawley's [...] "optical hijinks" [...] even after the first episode, where the story starts to become more clear.|$|E
500|$|There's a Riot Goin' On was {{included}} on several music publications' [...] "End of the Year" [...] lists and critics' polls, including The Village Voices Pazz & Jop albums list at number seven. The album achieved commercial success with two hit singles and debuting at number-one on the Billboard Pop Albums and Soul Albums chart. It later {{came to be}} viewed by critics {{as one of the}} greatest and most influential albums. Christgau wrote in 2007 that the [...] "temptations and contradictions" [...] of commercial stardom consumed Sly Stone and resulted in [...] "the prophetic 1971" [...] album, [...] "its taped-over murk presaging Exile on Main St., its drum-machine beats throwing knuckleballs at [...] and , it was darker than the Velvet Underground and Nico and funkier than shit, yet <b>somehow</b> <b>it</b> produced two smash hits, including the stark, deep 'Family Affair'." [...] AllMusic described the album as [...] "funk at its deepest and most impenetrable," [...] stating that [...] "what makes Riot so remarkable is that it's hard not to get drawn in with him, as you're seduced by the narcotic grooves, seductive vocals slurs, leering electric pianos, and crawling guitars." [...] Zeth Lundy of PopMatters deemed it [...] "a challenging listen, at times rambling, incoherent, dissonant, and just plain uncomfortable" [...] with [...] "some episodic moments of pop greatness to be found". Lundy went on to discuss its radical departure from the band's past music: ...|$|E

500|$|The Edge of Glory was {{met with}} general acclaim from critics. While {{previewing}} the song Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone wrote a positive review: [...] "This one sounds crazy in print , but <b>somehow</b> <b>it</b> all seems totally natural when you actually hear it." [...] Perpetua added {{that there is an}} element of cheesiness in the song, but nevertheless, it is captivating and catchy when one listens to it. He complimented the inclusion of Clemons as an [...] "inspired touch that amplifies the song's Eighties stadium rock vibe," [...] and Clemons' actual performance was described as amazing and among the best of his career. In another review, Perpetua noted that [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] is [...] "an immediate pop anthem". Fellow Rolling Stone journalist Jody Rosen complimented the hook, the chorus and Clemens' saxophone playing on the song. Jocelyn Vena from MTV News asserted that the song showed a softer side to Gaga, as opposed to her previous singles from Born This Way. Willa Paskin from New York was impressed with the track, saying: [...] "If the first two tracks off the forthcoming Born This Way were all jangly dance-rock, this is as smooth as an '80s jam straight off the Flashdance soundtrack, and it has the saxophone breakdown to prove it." [...] Paskin also believed that the song had potential to be a summer hit, but could face competition from singer Katy Perry's single, [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)".|$|E
500|$|Grant's {{appeal was}} unusually broad, among {{both men and}} women; Kael remarked that men wanted to be him and women dreamed of dating him. She noticed that Grant treated his female co-stars {{differently}} {{to most of the}} leading players at the time, regarding them as subjects with multiple qualities rather than [...] "treating them as sex objects". For writer David Shipman, he seemed to meet the requirement for every figure to aspire to be, whether it was an uncle, best friend or lover, and [...] "more than most stars he belonged to the public". A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one. Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal in his review for Mr. Lucky (1943) stated that if it [...] "weren't for Cary Grant's persuasive personality the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all". For McCann Hollywood had [...] "found its ideal gentleman, a gentleman for a democratic culture. He was an amalgam of tradition and modernity, wealth and virtue, elite and mass, high and low, great and good". He states that Grant's delivery should [...] "not have worked, but <b>somehow</b> <b>it</b> did", commenting: [...] "As he sits and faces the camera during that early scene in The Awful Truth, he looks at us with an expression that suggests he knows as well as we do that the audacious trick has, against all the odds, actually come off. He smiles at us, sharing with us his extraordinary good fortune. He smiles a smile like Gatsby's smile." [...] Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a [...] "new and very important symbol", a new type of Englishman who differed from the Leslie Howard and Ronald Coleman gentleman types, who represented the [...] "freedom, natural grace, simplicity and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan", which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America.|$|E

[...] The Diamondbacks Michael Greenwald reported that [...] "SexyBack" [...] was [...] "lyrically, musically and vocally the weakest song" [...] on the album. A writer of The State Journal-Register was not impressed with the song and concluded, with SexyBack' is the most annoyingly dumb song to hit Billboards No. 1 since 'Hollaback Girl'". Guy Blackman of The Sunday Age wrote: [...] "The distorted vocals and stilted production of first single 'Sexyback' make Timberlake's claim to be 'bringing sexy back'... seem almost laughable."
