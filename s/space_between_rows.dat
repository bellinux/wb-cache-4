50|$|Erysiphe cruciferarum {{produces}} {{well when}} it is in moderate to high humidity with moderate temperatures. Temperatures between 70-80 °F (22-27 °C) with low relative humidity {{during the day and}} high relative humidity at night are favorable ranges. This pathogen has a wide host range. It can infect many wild plants along with cash crops. It has the ability to jump from field weeds to cultivated crops within a single season if the conditions are right. It will reduce photosynthesis and affect yields on cultivated crops. With that, this pathogen can be very troublesome in a greenhouse and protected environment, as these spaces provide ideal growing conditions. Protected growing environments tend to have temperatures and humidity within the pathogen's desired range to reproduce. Wind and rain can also spread the spores of E. cruciferarum. Adding vegetative wind barriers can impede the spores' travel into the cultivated field and possibly lower the chance of infection. High planting densities will decrease the distance and time needed to travel to a new healthy host. Lowering the planting density or adding <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> can aid in slowing the spores' spread.|$|E

5000|$|... "Stadium seating", {{popular in}} modern multiplexes, {{actually}} {{dates back to}} the 1920s. The 1922 Princess Theatre in Honolulu, Hawaii featured [...] "stadium seating," [...] sharply raked rows of seats extending from in front of the screen back towards the ceiling. It gives patrons a clear sight line over the heads of those seated in front of them. Modern [...] "stadium seating" [...] was utilized in IMAX theaters, which have very tall screens, beginning in the early 1970s.Rows of seats are divided by one or more aisles so that there are seldom more than 20 seats in a row. This allows easier access to seating, as the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> is very narrow. Depending on the angle of rake of the seats, the aisles have steps. In older theaters, aisle lights were often built into the end seats of each row to help patrons find their way in the dark. Since the advent of stadium theaters with stepped aisles, each step in the aisles may be outlined with small lights to prevent patrons from tripping in the darkened theater. In movie theaters, the auditorium may also have lights that go to a low level, when the movie is going to begin. Theaters often have booster seats for children and other short people to put on the seat, to sit higher, for a better view. Many modern theaters have accessible seating areas for patrons in wheelchairs. See also luxury screens below.|$|E

This announcement was prompted by a five million dollar donation from the international philanthropic organization, the Stavros Niarchos Foundation. Renovations on the Parkway Theatre began in early 2012, but this recent donation has greatly assisted the process. The theater will be renamed the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Parkway Film Centre and will contain three screens, six hundred twenty seats, and a live performance area, the main auditorium will have a seating capacity of 420 seats and the new building next door will contain two smaller 100 seat theatres bringing {{the total number of}} seats to 620. The center will not only be dedicated to exhibiting films; it will also be a space for education. It will aid both (JHU) Johns Hopkins University and the MICA’s film programs by allowing them to study the production of filmmaking and documentation [...] It is also envisioned as a site of the Maryland Film Festival. Updates to the center will include new projection, sound, and movie viewing technology also including heating and air conditioning ventilation systems. Although there will be modern additions to the center, the goal of the renovation is to maintain the theater’s historical integrity, as Jed Dietz puts it [...] "we're not exactly Restoring it, It's more about Rescuing it". [...] Current construction updates are as follows: The old flooring of the lobby, orchestra and stage areas have been removed and new flooring has been laid, the old deteriorated stage curtain has been removed and will be replaced with a brand new one after construction is completed, all the old seats on the balcony level have been removed and will be replaced with new wider comfortable seats that will have cup holders to accommodate patrons, the platforms on the balcony level has been deepened to create more legroom and better walking <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>rows,</b> the tea room on the second floor has been expanded twice its regular size to include a bar and lounge area, the building at 1 West North Avenue which formerly housed a pharmacy store and restaurant will be demolished and replaced by a new building which will house two smaller sized 100 seat theatres and a small lounge in the foyer area which will be connected with the SNF Parkway.. The design phase of the project was completed in January 2015. The Parkway celebrated its 100th birthday on October 23rd 2015 marking the 100th anniversary of its grand opening on October 23rd 1915 with the showing of Pauline Frederick in Zaza. The Parkway is expected to have its Grand reopening in mid-2017, Station North is aiming to attract as many patrons for its Inaugural Grand Reopening. The estimated total cost of the renovation is $18.2 million. The current status of the construction phase is nearly complete, the corner building that formerly housed a pharmacy and restraurant has been demolished and the new structure that will house the 2 smaller 100 seat theatres along with the lounge is nearing completion, the interior of the Parkway has been partially restored (new paint as well as the original paint can be seen on the walls and ceiling surrounding the dome), as well as the addition of a replicated 1915 marquee with a nicely clean facade illuminated by replicated light bulbs on top above the original name PARKWAY THEATRE carved into the building. The Maryland Film Festival is currently seeking volunteers and employees to help with the exciting event taking place on May 3rd 2017, which will be the Grand Opening of the SNF Parkway Film Center as well as the 19th annual Maryland Film Festival.|$|E

A reduction in row spacing provided better spatial distribution of plants, but did not alter morphological composition or dry matter production. The corn with most equidistant spatial distribution (lowest row spacing) showed an increase in lignin concentration, neutral detergent fiber, and total carbohydrates, and showed a decrease in total digestible nutrients when compared with 80 cm row spacing. However, the organic digestibility matter was not affected by the treatments.

Alongside the development of the trees, the Marandu palisade grass pasture was reestablished. In February 2015, the animals were removed from the experimental area and, in March, the pasture degradation, the density and the mass of tillers was assessed. The following variables were evaluated: sward height; forage mass, percentage of leaf blade, stem+sheath and senescent material; leaf blade:stem+sheath ratio; and live:dead material ratio. The experimental design was completely randomized, with 12 replicates. Treatments consisted of two systems (silvopastoral and monoculture). The total forage accumulation was higher in the monoculture system. The sward height and the percentage of stem+sheath were higher in the integrated system, while the percentage of leaf blade and the leaf blade:stem+sheath ratio were higher in the system exclusively with forage. In conclusion, Marandu palisade grass tolerates shading in a high density spacing silvopastoral system, but the degradation process is more intense compared to grass in monoculture, and the use of Marandu palisade grass in silvopastoral systems changes the forage mass and the structure of the produced forage...|$|E

The low yield of wheat is the consequence of many factors including rust diseases that cause yield along with quality losses. Most of breeding programs in the country lack facilities for screening against rust diseases. Usually, selection is done with inadequate rust epidemic or improper pathotypes. As a result, only a few of released cultivars exhibit desired resistance against the prevailing rust diseases. A study was conducted during 2013 rainy season at sodo zuria woreda to provide information on the level of resistance in 20 released bread wheat varieties against rust diseases.

Alley cropping is an agroforestry practice that utilizes the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> of trees to produce an alternate crop. Tall fescue demonstrates shade tolerance and may be well suited for the production of certified seed in alley-cropping systems in Missouri. The objective was to evaluate tall fescue seed production in alley cropping. Three management practices associated with grass seed production were also evaluated; row spacing, N fertilization, and post-harvest residue management. In 2004 seed yields in the alley-cropped plots were similar to the open plots; in 2005, all plots had reduced yield and the alley-cropped plots yielded significantly less than the open plots. We attribute the decrease of the second year harvest to poor soil moisture and increased competition from trees. Seed yield was closely related to the number of reproductive culms m- 1 of row; however, there were no differences among treatments for seed weight and seeds culm- 1. This research shows that tall fescue seed yield in an alley-cropping system can be equal to yields from pasture until competition for resources from trees has a negative influence on the crop. A producer who is interested in establishing an orchard should find that certified turf-type tall fescue is a viable crop for an alley-cropping system...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{information on the}} findings relating to the Thraco-Getian period, which {{have been identified as}} a result of archaeological excavations in 2009 - 2012 on the site of Saharna Mare. In examining orthophotomaps and the results and geomagnetic prospecting there was discovered a new defensive line traced over 650 m to the north, east and south sides of the cape. Its ends are connected to the "wall" on the west side, thus forming an integral defensive system surrounding the fortress on all sides and having an area of approximately 6 hectares. This recently discovered defensive line represents a "rampart" barely visible on the current surface of the soil, having at the base a width of 3 m and a height of about 0. 3 - 0. 4 m. Toward the east this "rampart" meanders, forming eight bastions grouped in four on the northern and southern flanks. As a result of archaeological investigation {{it was found that the}} identified "rampart" is the remains of a defensive wall built of two rows of wooden poles dug vertically into the mainland. The <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> was filled with stones and earth, thus forming a fortification of about 1. 1 - 1. 6 m width. In the settlement there were also examined two above-ground structures, 36 household pits and fairly rich and varied inventory attributable to the 8 th/ 7 th - 3 rd centuries BC. Judging by its strategic location, powerful defensive structures, and by the findings found in the area of the site, it can be assumed that the fortified settlement of Saharna Mare was an important economic, political, administrative and military center of the Middle Dniester region. ...|$|E

The system has an integrated sensor suite for problem-drum detection, and is linked to a site database both for inspection planning and for data correlation, updating, and report generation. The system is capable of departing on an assigned mission, collecting required data, recording which portions of its mission had to be aborted or modified due to environmental constraints, and reporting back when the mission is complete. Successful identification of more than 96 % of drum defects has been demonstrated in a high fidelity waste storage facility mockup. Identified anomalies included rust spots, rust streaks, areas of corrosion, dents, and tilted drums. All drums were positively identified and correlated with the site database. This development effort is separated into three phases of which phase two is now complete. The first phase demonstrated an integrated system (maturity level IVa) for monitoring and inspection activities for waste storage facility operations. The second phase demonstrated a prototype system appropriate for operational use in an actual storage facility. The prototype provides an integrated design that considers operational requirements, hardware costs, maintenance, safety, and robustness. The final phase will demonstrate commercial viability using the prototype vehicle in a pilot waste operations and inspection project. This report summarizes the design and evaluation of the new IMSS Phase 2 system and vehicle...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Tobacco with {{scientific}} name of (Nicotiana tabacum L.) belongs to Solanaceae family {{is one of}} the important industrial crops in the world that plays a critical role in economy of producing countries and its income from various products had a major share of the national income. Tobacco is an annual, short day length and self pollinated crop that its chromosomal number is 2 n= 48. The yield of plants depends upon several production factors. Among these proper, balanced nutrition plays a significant role. The main purpose of fertilization in tobacco plants not only the quantity but quality should be considered. Now tobacco farmers apply a large amount of fertilizer to improve yields, but these actions not only decrease tobacco leaf quality, but also cause fertilizer pollution. Organic and chemical fertilizers use has {{played a significant role in}} increase of crop yield. The use of compost and vermicompost in the soil, generally in order to maintain and increase aggregate stability and fertility of soils for farming and gardening in the past decade has been of particular importance. Increasing soil organic matter stocks and stability by addition of organic amendment offers a good way to substantially improve soil quality and therefore agricultural sustainability. The objective of this study was evaluate the effect of chemical and organic fertilizer on morpho-physiological and yield of tobacco in field conditions. Materials and Methods In order to study the effects of organic and chemical fertilizers on morpho-physiological traits of baurley tobacco cultivar, an experiment was counducted as based on a randomized complete block design with three replications during growing season of 2012 - 2013 at the research field of Shahrekord University located in 50 º 49 ´ E longitude and 32 º 21 ´ N latitude. with sea level of 2116 meter. Treatments included chemical fertilizers based on the tobacco needs and soil test results, compost based on the tobacco needs and soil test results, 50 percent compost + 50 percent chemical fertilizer, vermicompost based on the tobacco needs and soil test results, 50 percent vermicompost + 50 percent chemical fertilizer and control (no use of fertilizer). Sowing in nursery was done in March 2013 and transplanted to field May 2013. After plowing and disking and leveling by rotary, tobacco seedling were transplanted in main field. In current study the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>rows</b> was 80 cm and between plants on rows was 50 cm. Number row planting in each plots were 6 rows. The area of every plot was 5 × 4 m 2.
