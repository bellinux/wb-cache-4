40|$|The study got two {{modified}} blades {{by changing}} the structure {{and shape of the}} rotor blade of the pressure screen. Pulp flow field in the same condition is numerically simulated by the fluid dynamics software FLUENT. The pressure distribution is showed especially in the location of the <b>sieve</b> <b>drum</b> circle. The ideal blade structure is obtained by the pressure field compared with conventional blades. It has strong cleaning ability and not easy to blockage <b>sieve</b> <b>drum.</b> The shape of the rotor blade is optimized. The blade shape is analyzed to the influence law of energy consumption. It is proved that the new rotor has energy-saving advantages. It is significant to improve the performance of pulp screening equipment. The theoretical support for select of blade shape of bars is provided by analysis of flow field...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the 3 -D {{features}} of the thermal-hydraulic system code CATHARE 2 were thoroughly assessed against the OECD/PKL- 2 ROCOM tests T 1. 1, T 2. 1 and T 2. 2 which focus on {{the evaluation of the}} thermal mixing in the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) under asymmetric buoyant cooling loop conditions. Furthermore, the calculation of the recent ROCOM test T 2. 3 (OECD/PKL- 3), which aims at detailed investigation of the thermal-hydraulic behavior inside the RPV during the emergency core cooling injection from accumulator to the cold leg, was performed in the framework of OECD/NEA/CSNI international benchmark activity. A successful application of CFD code to support a set-up of best estimate 3 -D SYS-TH nodalization of RPV was demonstrated. This was achieved by using ANSYS CFX code to evaluate the pressure losses throughout the vessel with further application of additional loss coefficients for the <b>sieve</b> <b>drum</b> and core support plate in CATHARE reference model in order to match the pressure drops predicted by the CFD model. The effect of nodalization refinement (axial, radial and azimuthal) of the ROCOM pressure vessel as well as the influence of the singular pressure losses in the <b>sieve</b> <b>drum</b> and core support plate on the predicted results was studied. It was observed that the number of azimuthal nodes is the most influential parameter on the mixing scalar. It also important to notice that the calculations conducted with refined grids show better general agreement with the experimental data. This {{is due to the fact}} that an increase of the node numbers causes a decrease of the numerical diffusion, which plays a vital role in the simulations. The performed qualitative analysis has shown the ability of CATHARE 3 -D models to capture the main {{features of the}} mixing phenomena in reactor pressure vessel using appropriate modelling, however from the quantitative point of view, the effectiveness of the thermal mixing is generally overpredicted. The obtained results are qualitatively comparable to the ones obtained with CFD codes, like ANSYS CFX, CODE_SATURNE, STAR-CCM+, however require considerably less computational resources. It also important to notice that applicability of the findings of the present studies to NPP scale has to be further investigated both experimentally and analytically, due to scaling distortions which are inevitably present in any scaled test facility...|$|E
50|$|In Afghanistan, the Nausar {{worked as}} tinkers and animal dealers. Ghorbat men mainly made <b>sieves,</b> <b>drums,</b> and bird cages, {{and the women}} peddled these {{as well as other}} items of {{household}} and personal use; they also worked as moneylenders to rural women. Peddling and the sale of various goods was also practiced by men and women of various groups, such as the Jalali, the Pikraj, the Shadibaz, the Noristani, and the Vangawala. The latter and the Pikraj also worked as animal dealers. Some men among the Shadibaz and the Vangawala entertained as monkey or bear handlers and snake charmers; men and women among the Baluch were musicians and dancers, and Baluch women also practiced prostitution. Jogi men and women had diverse subsistence activities, such as dealing in horses, harvesting, fortune-telling, bloodletting, and begging.|$|R

[...] Ricers are often used to puree food for babies.|$|R
50|$|The {{rectangular}} mill {{stands on}} a fieldstone foundation. The wooden body of the mill is faced with shingles. The boat-shaped roof is also covered with shingles. It has latticed vanes with a span of 60 ft, designed to be covered with sailcloth. The mill can be rotated {{by means of a}} manually operated yaw. For a period, a bakery was attached to the mill. The workings of the mill have been preserved and include grinders, an oat roller, a <b>drum</b> <b>sieve,</b> a cap wheel, a crown drive and a vane shaft.|$|R
5000|$|A tamis (pronounced [...] "tammy", {{also known}} as a <b>drum</b> <b>sieve,</b> or chalni in Indian cooking) is a kitchen utensil, shaped {{somewhat}} like a snare drum, that acts as a strainer, grater, or food mill. A tamis has a cylindrical edge, made of metal or wood, that supports a disc of fine metal, nylon, or horsehair mesh. To use one, the cook places the tamis above a bowl and adds the ingredient to be strained {{in the center of the}} mesh. The food is then pushed through using a scraper or pestle. Tamises have been in use since the Middle Ages.|$|R

40|$|To treat (polluted) {{water for}} any application, an {{overview}} is needed {{of the most}} cost-effective solutions for contaminations in terms of water-treatment techniques. This thesis has determined {{the contribution of the}} water filtration techniques; reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, sand filtration and <b>drum</b> <b>sieves,</b> based on the Modified Fouling Index (MFI), in removing suspended and colloidal particles from the feed water, taking the composition and application of the water sources into account. The MFI is a tool used to predict the fouling rate of water. It is an improvement of the commonly used Silt Density Index (SDI), which has some deficiencies. Previous research on the subject has not established a widely accepted test method to determine the optimal treatment method for a random source of water, based on the MFI. To determine the particles removed by the filter techniques, the MFI of the feed water and the effluent were measured and the difference in particles was determined. This was done for all filter techniques. To scientifically and statistically back this approach, different water treatment plants were visited to do these measurements and multiple calibrations were performed to determine the accuracy of the measurement method used. The measurements were performed using the MFI Forecaster for MFI and SDI. The results of the different techniques were compared with each other in order to draw a conclusion about a filtration technique regardless of type and location. As a result, a conclusion could be drawn regarding the removal of suspended and colloidal particles by the <b>drum</b> <b>sieves,</b> all proper functioning ultrafiltration systems and two of the three reverse osmosis types. A statistically backed conclusion was also drawn regarding the particle removal of the sand filters between the locations but not between the sand filters on a location itself. Further research is suggested on the relation between clean membrane resistance and the use of different support mediums on the MFI, {{as well as on the}} range of the measurement device, the usage of flocculant and the difference in the particle removal of the sand filters...|$|R
