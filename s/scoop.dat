5|$|In 1800 {{the civil}} {{engineers}} William Jessop and John Rennie assisted local engineers {{with plans for}} improvements, the chief of which was for a steam pumping station. This plan was not implemented immediately, but two steam engines fitted with <b>scoop</b> wheels were installed at Pode Hole in 1823. The pumping station was {{the largest in the}} Fens at the time, and remained so for many years. Steam gradually gave way to diesel engines and <b>scoop</b> wheels were replaced by centrifugal pumps, and the diesel engines were then replaced by electric motors. However, the beam engine and <b>scoop</b> wheel at Pinchbeck Marsh, which ran from 1833 to 1952, was not scrapped, and can be visited by the public.|$|E
5|$|The next match saw WWE Cruiserweight Champion Nunzio {{defend his}} title against Juventud. After a {{back and forth}} match between the two, Juventud pinned Nunzio after a sit-out <b>scoop</b> slam piledriver to win the match and the Cruiserweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on October 20, 2006, receiving positive reviews and strong box office results, and received Academy Award nominations for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction. Along with The Illusionist and <b>Scoop,</b> The Prestige {{was one of three}} films released in 2006 to explore the world of stage magicians.|$|E
50|$|Various <b>scooping</b> game {{variants}} are found, including turtle <b>scooping</b> (kame-sukui), jelly <b>scooping</b> (puyopuyo-sukui), {{which features}} small jelly-like rubber balls, super ballscooping (sūpābōru-sukui), which features bouncy balls, and character <b>scooping</b> (kyarakutā-sukui), which features small plastic figurines in {{the shapes of}} various cartoon characters, particularly manga and anime.|$|R
5000|$|In kitchenware, certain {{ice cream}} <b>scoops</b> are called spades {{due to the}} shape. These <b>scoops</b> are used more in making hand-scooped milkshakes or desserts {{where a lot of}} ice cream can be <b>scooped</b> at once and the typical [...] "ball" [...] shape of <b>scooped</b> ice cream (i.e., <b>scoops</b> on a cone) is not needed. The spade-shaped head also helps scrape off the ice cream stuck to the sides of the cartons.|$|R
5000|$|Tostitos <b>Scoops</b> - a tortilla chip molded {{into the}} shape of a bowl that allows for easier <b>scooping</b> of salsas and dips. Also {{available}} in Baked, advertised to have half the fat of normal tostitos <b>scoops.</b> Recently released [...] "Hint Of Jalapeño".|$|R
5|$|Andre Marhold, a {{small forward}} {{and the first}} of two {{incoming}} freshmen, signed with Duquesne on April 16. Marhold, a native of Pittsburgh who moved to North Carolina for High School, averaged 17.0 points and 10.0 rebounds per game his senior year, in which his team was the regular season champion. He was ranked 188 in the top 1000 high school seniors by Hoop <b>Scoop.</b> Marhold turned down scholarship offers from Clemson, Charlotte, and Purdue.|$|E
5|$|Ben Nevis is {{becoming}} popular with ski mountaineers and boarders. The Red Burn (Allt Coire na h-Urcaire) {{just to the}} North of the tourist path gives the easiest descent, but {{most if not all}} of the easier gullies on the North Face have been skied, as has the slope once adorned by the abseil poles into Coire Leis. No 4 gully is probably the most skied. Although Tower <b>scoop</b> makes it a no-fall zone, Tower Gully {{is becoming}} popular, especially in May and June when there is spring snow.|$|E
5|$|Bus chassis {{production}} {{began in}} 1950. VAT {{made the first}} prototypes of rear-engined buses in 1956. The company made two prototype chassis, which were designated model VAT-4800; the superstructures were made by coach builders Ajokki Oy and Nummela Oy. The solution caused several technical problems, including proper cooling and transfer of heating to {{the front end of}} the body. The cooling problem was finally solved by a large air <b>scoop</b> located at the back of the roof; this was not regarded as an aesthetically pleasing arrangement. As the solution was found, VAT produced ten more rear-engined chassis called type VAT-5200.|$|E
50|$|Bunny chow is a <b>scooped</b> out loaf with fufu or atchar {{inside and}} with the <b>scooped</b> out bread placed on top.|$|R
50|$|Some higher-end {{ice cream}} <b>scoops</b> have a {{thermally}} conductive liquid in the handle {{to help keep}} the ice cream from freezing to the <b>scoop's</b> metal.|$|R
40|$|Algae <b>scooping</b> is a {{behaviour}} in which wild chimpanzees in Bossou (Guinea) use tools {{to feed on}} aquatic algae by <b>scooping</b> and wrapping algae round the stick. Algae <b>scooping</b> has been suggested to require social learning to develop due to its rarity across other chimpanzee sites in Africa and differences in techniques within the community of Bossou. Here we argue that algae <b>scooping</b> does not necessarily require social transmission to develop but instead is within the chimpanzee’s ‘Zone of Latent Solutions’: their cognitive repertoire...|$|R
5|$|Following the {{rallying}} {{successes of}} the Simca 1000 and the Talbot Sunbeam, PSA launched the Samba Rallye. Fitted with the 1219cc XW version of the X engine, delivering 66kilowatt (90PS), it came in either white or red, with a hood <b>scoop</b> and side stripes. In 1985, a version with the 1360cc unit producing 59kilowatt (80PS) was launched, without the stripes. A special rallye-only Group B model, officially called the Peugeot Talbot Sport Samba Rallye preceded the later Peugeot 205 T16, with a 1285cc, 96kilowatt engine (130PS).|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Pennsbury High School, {{where he}} was coached by Frank Sciolla. Former Temple player Dalton Pepper was his high school teammate. In ninth grade, Allen decided {{that he wanted to}} be great, and put in much more practice time. He became a starter on the varsity team in his sophomore year. As a junior, he averaged 12 points and nine rebounds per game, and was named a Top 150 player in his class by Hoop <b>Scoop.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mouse lemurs (Microcebus), sifakas (Propithecus), and the indri (Indri) {{use their}} toothcombs to <b>scoop</b> up fruit pulp. Other small lemuriforms, such as fork-marked lemurs (Phaner), the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus), and galagos (particularly the genera Galago and Euoticus) use their toothcombs to tooth-scrape plant exudates, such as gum and sap. In fork-marked lemurs, the toothcomb is {{specially}} adapted to minimize food trapment since the interdental spaces are greatly reduced. The herbivorous colugos in the genus Cynocephalus may also use their toothcomb for food procurement.|$|E
50|$|In the Zubrin/Andrews interplanetary ramjet design, they {{calculated}} that the drag force d/dt(mv1) equals {{the mass of the}} <b>scooped</b> ions collected per second multiplied by the velocity of the <b>scooped</b> ions within the solar system relative to the ramscoop. The velocity of the (<b>scooped)</b> collected ions from the solar wind was assumed to be 500,000 m/s.|$|R
25|$|In Japan, {{during summer}} festivals and {{religious}} holidays (ennichi), a traditional game called goldfish <b>scooping</b> is played, {{in which a}} player <b>scoops</b> goldfish from a basin with a special scooper. Sometimes bouncy balls are substituted for goldfish.|$|R
5000|$|Goldfish <b>scooping</b> (Kingyo-sukui) is a {{traditional}} Japanese game in which a player <b>scoops</b> goldfish with a special scooper. It is also called, [...] "Scooping Goldfish", [...] "Dipping for Goldfish" [...] or [...] "Snatching Goldfish". [...] "Kingyo" [...] means goldfish and [...] "sukui" [...] means <b>scooping.</b> Sometimes bouncy balls are used instead of goldfish. Japanese summer festivals or ennichi commonly have a stall for this activity. Both children and adults enjoy the game.|$|R
5|$|On June 18, 2015, Manitoba Premier Greg Selinger {{became the}} first {{politician}} to issue a formal apology for the government's role in the Sixties <b>Scoop.</b> Class action lawsuits have been brought against the Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario governments for the harm caused to victims of the large-scale adoption scheme that saw thousands of Indigenous children forcibly removed from their parents in the 1960s. Indigenous leaders responded by insisting that while apologies were welcomed, action – including a federal apology, reunification of families, compensation and counselling for victims – must accompany words {{for them to have}} real meaning.|$|E
5|$|Palestinians bake {{a variety}} of {{different}} kinds of breads: they include khubz, pita and markook and taboon. Khubz is an everyday bread and is very similar to pita. It often takes the place of utensils; It is torn into bite size pieces and used to <b>scoop</b> various dips such as hummus or ful. Markook bread is a paper-thin unleavened bread and when unfolded it is almost transparent. Taboon receives its name from the ovens used to bake them.|$|E
5|$|The Czerkases {{contacted}} paleontologist Phil Currie, who {{contacted the}} National Geographic Society. Currie agreed {{to study the}} fossil on condition that it was eventually returned to China. The National Geographic Society intended to get the fossil formally published in the peer-reviewed science journal Nature, and then follow up immediately with a press conference and an issue of National Geographic. Editor Bill Allen asked that {{all members of the}} project keep the fossil secret, so that the magazine would have a <b>scoop</b> on the story.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to their tea, American Tea Room carries a host of porcelain, glass, and cast iron teapots, tea cups, and tea accessories for <b>scooping,</b> steeping, and storing tea. They also carry a range of matcha related bowls, whisks, and <b>scoops.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On August 4, 2010, <b>Scoops</b> quit {{on the air}} {{after being}} confronted by Afentra about being two hours late to work. On the morning of August 16, 2010, Danny Boi {{returned}} to [...] "Afentra's Big Fat Morning Buzz" [...] in place of <b>Scoops.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The first British {{science fiction}} {{magazine}} {{was launched in}} 1934, when Pearson's launched <b>Scoops,</b> a weekly in tabloid format aimed at the juvenile market. [...] Soon Dimmock, <b>Scoops</b> editor, began to receive more sophisticated stories, targeted at an adult audience; he tried to change the magazine's focus to include more mature fiction but within twenty issues falling sales led Pearson's to kill the magazine. [...] The failure of <b>Scoops</b> gave British publishers the impression that Britain could not support a science fiction publication.|$|R
5|$|The main {{hydraulic}} system provided pressure for undercarriage raising and lowering and bogie trim; nosewheel centring and steering; wheelbrakes (fitted with Maxarets); bomb doors opening and closing; and (B.2 only) AAPP air <b>scoop</b> lowering. Hydraulic pressure {{was provided by}} three hydraulic pumps fitted to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines. An electrically operated hydraulic power pack (EHPP) {{could be used to}} operate the bomb doors and recharge the brake accumulators. A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.|$|E
5|$|Most birds <b>scoop</b> {{water in}} their beaks {{and raise their}} head to let water run down the throat. Some species, {{especially}} of arid zones, belonging to the pigeon, finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads. Some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes. Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers. Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. The pigeon family, flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match was}} a Pinfalls Count Anywhere {{match for the}} WWE Championship, as John Cena defended against The Great Khali. Khali had control {{for most of the}} contest, {{performing}} a spin kick and a leg drop onto Cena. The contest went into the crowd, as Khali hit Cena with a television monitor. Cena gained the advantage, swinging the boom camera by the crew set into Khali. Cena attempted to perform the FU, but Khali blocked it with his elbow. Khali regained the upper hand, <b>scoop</b> slamming Cena onto a crane. Cena fought back while on the crane and performed an FU to Khali off the crane onto the arena floor. Cena got the pinfall and the victory.|$|E
25|$|Savonius wind turbine: These are drag-type devices {{with two}} (or more) <b>scoops</b> {{that are used}} in anemometers, Flettner vents (commonly seen on bus and van roofs), and in some high-reliability low-efficiency power turbines. They are always {{self-starting}} if {{there are at least three}} <b>scoops.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} flies at {{high speed}} (approximately 100 mph) just above {{the surface of a}} lake or reservoir, <b>scooping</b> up copious amounts of water into its belly. In just 12 seconds, the plane can accumulate 1,600 gallons of water, to be subsequently dropped onto nearby fires raging out of control. This <b>scooping</b> ability obviates the need to return to a water [...] "refilling station" [...] which could possibly be very far away. A pilot must be certified to operate a seaplane, to ensure water conditions are safe for <b>scooping</b> (i.e., not having choppy waves).|$|R

5|$|Touchstone Pictures {{opted to}} move the release date up a week, from the {{original}} October 27, to October 20, 2006. The film earned $14.8 million on opening weekend in the United States, debuting at #1. It grossed $109 million, including $53 million from the United States. The film received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction (Nathan Crowley and Julie Ochipinti) and the Academy Award for Best Cinematography (Wally Pfister), {{as well as a}} nomination for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form in 2007. Along with The Illusionist and <b>Scoop</b> (also starring Jackman and Johansson), The Prestige was one of three films in 2006 to explore the world of stage magicians.|$|E
5|$|Upgrading of {{the plant}} {{occurred}} several times. The Kesteven and Holland engines were overhauled in 1881 and 1883 respectively. Flow into the wheel pits was restricted by the provision of shuttles, and rising breasts were fitted on the outflow, so that the height at which the water was discharged could be varied as the water level in Vernatt's drain varied. Five new boilers, which could supply either engine, were fitted in 1883, and {{had been replaced by}} five more some time before 1928, for the new boilers failed in that year. The Kesteven engine had its <b>scoop</b> wheel removed, although the rest {{of the plant}} was not scrapped until 1952.|$|E
5|$|Ursa Minor is {{bordered by}} Camelopardalis to the west, Draco to the west, and Cepheus to the east. Covering 256square degrees, it ranks 56th of the 88 constellations in size. Ursa Minor is colloquially {{known in the}} US as the Little Dipper because its seven {{brightest}} stars seem to form {{the shape of a}} dipper (ladle or <b>scoop).</b> The star {{at the end of the}} dipper handle is Polaris. Polaris can also be found by following a line through the two stars—Alpha and Beta Ursae Majoris—that form the end of the 'bowl' of the Big Dipper, for 30 degrees (three upright fists at arms' length) across the night sky. The four stars constituting the bowl of the Little Dipper are of second, third, fourth, and fifth magnitudes, and provide an easy guide to determining what magnitude stars are visible, useful for city dwellers or testing one's eyesight.|$|E
