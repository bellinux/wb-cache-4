5|$|Narayan's {{greatest}} {{achievement was}} making India {{accessible to the}} outside world through his literature. He is {{regarded as one of the}} three leading English language Indian fiction writers, along with Raja Rao and Mulk Raj Anand. He gave his readers <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> with Malgudi and its residents and is considered to be one of the best novelists India has ever produced. He brought small-town India to his audience in a manner that was both believable and experiential. Malgudi was not just a fictional town in India, but one teeming with characters, each with their own idiosyncrasies and attitudes, making the situation as familiar to the reader as if it were their own backyard. In 2014, Google commemorated Narayan's 108th birthday by featuring a doodle showing him behind a copy of Malgudi Days.|$|E
5|$|In The King of Fighters XIII, Iori's {{gameplay}} mechanics were {{modified to}} {{be a close}} range fighter. Despite losing his flaming techniques, he was given brutal moves using his nails to emphasize his character's ferociousness. His strongest technique in the game, , is a new move that focuses on violent combos {{and serves as a}} reference to the character's ending from The King of Fighters '96 in which he brutally murders his teammates. Iori's 10th color scheme in the game matches his classic outfit's scheme, and during development of the game, details were added to increase the similarities. The ending of the character {{at the end of the}} game was also pointed by developers as <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to.</b> His version, featuring his classic techniques, was designed with the intention of not surpassing the current Iori so that players would choose the fighting style they prefer in the game. This was further emphasized in the console version of The King of Fighters XIII where Iori had his moveset adjusted for better balancing by not using flaming techniques.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{characters}} that could {{appear in the}} season, Bell said in May 2015 that [...] "The idea of some familiar faces with some new faces is <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to.</b> I also think finding some new Marvel characters to pull into the universe would be cool. Fans seem to respond when there are characters from the Marvel comics and Marvel Cinematic Universe." [...] He later explained that the series {{has the opportunity to}} explore the Inhumans outside of the Royal Family (who are the major focus of the comics, television series and previously planned film). The season mentions the character Eden Fesi as an Inhuman, who is a mutant in the comics. The change was due to 20th Century Fox controlling the film and television rights to the majority of Marvel's X-Men and mutant characters.|$|E

500|$|Bourque {{has been}} {{involved}} in many charitable endeavours both in Calgary and Lac La Biche. He says this lifestyle was tough growing up, which is why he started the Bourque Buddies charity to help Metis children have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> and work towards. “You see the effects of stuff that goes on in small towns or even in reserves and it’s a tough life for a lot of those kids,” Bourque says. He started the Rene Bourque Hockey Fund with the goal of providing hockey equipment to underprivileged kids, and has appeared as a spokesman for Native Americans in sport at youth symposiums. His fund led to the donation of 50 sets of equipment to underprivileged children in Northern Alberta during the 2008–09 season, and over 100 sets in 2010–11. [...] Also in 2010–11, he started a program called [...] "Bourque's Buddies" [...] that rewards kids from the Tsuu T'ina Nation who have made positive contributions in their schools with tickets to Flames games.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 December Satono Diamond was matched against older {{opposition}} {{when he was}} one {{of sixteen}} horses invited to contest the Arima Kinen over 2500 metres at Nakayama. He was made the 2.6/1 favourite ahead of the four-year-old Kitasan Black and the 2015 winner Gold Actor. The other runners included Sounds of Earth (second in 2015), Cheval Grand (Hanshin Daishoten, Copa Republica Argentina), Marialite (Queen Elizabeth II Cup, Takarazuka Kinen) and Mikki Queen (Yushun Himba, Shuka Sho). Satono Diamond raced in mid-division on the outside as the Maltese Apogee set the pace from Kitasan Black. He moved up to third place entering the straight before producing a late burst of acceleration to overtake Kitasan Black well inside the last 100 metres and win by a neck with Gold Actor half a length away in third place. Lemaire said [...] "He is such an easy ride. He makes my job so easy. He was a little slow to react on the last turn. But he was so strong in front of goal. He has such a big heart", whilst Ikee commented [...] "It’s a huge relief. He’ll be able to take it up a notch or two next season. He should really come into his own by the fall. He just beat the best horses in all of Japan as a 3-year-old, which is great and gives us <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> next year." ...|$|E

40|$|The current {{investigation}} explored both {{the process and}} content of four separate online support groups run through CancerChatCanada, with a national sample of caregivers of individuals with advanced-stage cancers. A grounded theory analysis of the chat transcripts led to the generation of the core category, ""Logging In Strained, Logging Out Sustained"", which captures {{the essence of the}} group experience, and is characterized by the following main categories: (I) The Life of a Caregiver; (2) Group as <b>Something</b> <b>to</b> <b>Look</b> <b>Forward</b> to; and (3) Facilitator as Guarantor of Maximal Group Utility. Altogether, the findings that emerged from this study provide insight into the range and depth of the cancer caregiver experience, the meaning of online caregiver support groups to those who utilize them, and the various ways in which facilitators skillfully manage group sessions so to enhance their value. ...|$|R

Martin-Green felt that Sasha learned how to [...] "entertain hope and connect with people" [...] more through Bob. He also showed her that there's {{more to life than}} just [...] "survival." [...] An event which later takes place comes into fruition where she tries to entertain hope with one of the group's hostages, a police officer with the name of Bob who takes advantage of her grief and knocks her out, managing to escape from the group's clutches thereafter. Martin-Green felt that this turned Sasha back to where she had been before forming a bond with Bob, but even less trusting.|$|R

Gabriel Tate called it a [...] "truly scattershot affair" [...] in Time Out, with Jean Reno its sole saving-grace, and awarded it two out of five stars. Eurodrama called it [...] "A visually arresting series with a tightly controlled central performance from Jean Reno, that takes us on a whistle-stop tour of Paris' most sensational locations, and its most depraved, but never shifts its focus from {{the story of a man}} who will always be enslaved by anguish.". ZombieHamster said: [...] "There's plenty to enjoy within the eight episodes. Joe is wonderfully engrossing and thrilling with lavish set pieces, and is carried by a marvelous central performance by Reno who is at his surly and cantankerous best." [...] Munya Vomo in the South African Independent Online labeled the series as [...] "definitely <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to".|$|R

And while we live in this retreat of ours, over here the very name of Harry Norland will have been forgotten. Queer, that! We shall go on living long after we are dead and buried and forgotten.
