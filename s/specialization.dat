5|$|With {{economies of}} scale, the PPF would curve inward, with the {{opportunity}} cost of one good falling as more of it is produced. <b>Specialization</b> in producing successive units of a good determines its opportunity cost (say from mass production methods or <b>specialization</b> of labor).|$|E

5|$|Skin {{toxicity}} evolved alongside bright coloration, perhaps preceding it. Toxicity {{may have}} relied on a shift in diet to alkaloid-rich arthropods, which likely occurred {{at least four times}} among the dendrobatids. Conspicuous coloration in these frogs is further associated with diet <b>specialization,</b> body mass, aerobic capacity, and chemical defense. Either aposematism and aerobic capacity preceded greater resource gathering, making it easier for frogs to go out and gather the ants and mites required for diet <b>specialization,</b> contrary to classical aposematic theory, which assumes that toxicity from diet arises before signaling. Alternatively, diet <b>specialization</b> preceded higher aerobic capacity, and aposematism evolved to allow dendrobatids to gather resources without predation.|$|E

40|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} use {{a variety}} of foraging <b>specializations</b> to detect and pursue prey. Like other mammals, individual dolphins may use specialized foraging techniques that are shaped in response to habitat or particular prey resources. The long duration of the mother-calf bond presents an opportunity for mothers to transmit such <b>specializations</b> to their calves, and cases of observational learning by dolphins are well known from captive colonies. This study explored how <b>specializations</b> may influence choices of habitat use and on how such <b>specializations</b> may spread within a community. A focal follow technique was used to document the foraging behavior of five resident females and their calves from June-August 2003 in Sarasota, FL. Females significantly differed in their selection of foraging habitats. Three of the five focal females used known foraging <b>specializations,</b> kerplunking and barrier feeding, and exhibited a preference for only one type. Females also increased the use of foraging habitats associated with their preferred foraging <b>specializations.</b> Limited observations, as well as anecdotal evidence from past studies, suggest that maternal transmission {{may play a role in}} the spread of kerplunking and barrier feeding within a community. Findings suggest that the use of foraging <b>specializations</b> is associated with foraging habitat preferences in Sarasota Bay as well as support the importance of incorporating knowledge of social behavior into the management structure for bottlenose dolphins. Many questions still remain concerning the prey specificity, stability, and sex-specific nature of foraging <b>specializations</b> and future studies should concentrate on these areas of research...|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of {{graduation}} all officers are qualified for operational service. However, each employee must undergo 40 hours of yearly training, including firearms practice, to keep their operational certification. Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent of police officers in 2012 lacked such certification. The main {{reason is that the}} police districts see it as a waste of resources to train investigation and administrative staff which do not participate in operative duty, and that a higher quality is achieved through <b>specialization</b> of tasks, such as dedicated investigation personnel.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, legal scholars disagree about whether circuit splits are detrimental or beneficial.

5|$|Killer {{whales are}} apex predators, {{meaning that they}} {{themselves}} have no natural predators. They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea, because they hunt in groups like wolf packs.
