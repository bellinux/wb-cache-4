40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{performance of}} a <b>solid</b> <b>vane</b> was experimentally determined in a full-annular cascade, where three-dimensional effects could be obtained. This vane was {{of the same size}} and profile as the cooled vanes to be subsequently tested. The vanes were tested over a pressure ratio range that corresponded to mean-radius ideal aftermixed critical velocity ratios of 0. 71 to 0. 89. Overall vane aftermixed efficiencies were obtained over this range of critical velocity ratios and compared with results from a four-vane annular-sector cascade. The variation in vane aftermixed conditions and vane aftermixed efficiency with radius were also obtained and compared with design values. Vane surface static-pressure distributions were measured and compared with theory and with the results obtained in the four-vane cascade...|$|E
40|$|Volvo Aero Corporation {{designs and}} {{manufactures}} components for civil jet engines. Design solutions for intermediate cases with integrated outlet guide vanes, {{which has the}} job to both carry load and direct the by pass air, are considered competitive for the future. Critical factors when designing integrated outlet guide vanes are weight, cost, structural stiffness, sound damping and operating life. Historically, the outlet guide vane (OGV) configuration has been solid vanes manufactured in materials like aluminium and titanium. A <b>solid</b> <b>vane</b> design will make the target weight for the outlet guide vanes to be exceeded, especially when engines are getting larger in diameter due to a desire to increase the by-pass flow. One way of reducing {{the weight of the}} OGV design is to make them hollow. The question is if a hollow vane will fulfil the mechanical requirements that an OGV configuration must withstand. Several concepts of OGV configurations have been developed and analyzed. <b>Solid</b> <b>vane</b> concepts have also been analyzed for reference purposes. The different concepts have also been evaluated with respect to material selection. Both the use of aluminium and titanium has been considered, since these are the most commonly used materials in outlet guide vanes. The chosen concept is made in titanium with a sheet thickness of 2 mm and has solid leading and trailing edge. The vane also has a polymer-foam core to increase the stiffness even further. By making the vanes hollow in titanium, the weight can be decreased with 10 % compared to making them solid in aluminium. The analysis showed that the configuration with a foam core has better strength properties and is more resistance to buckling than the configuration without a foam core.

40|$|Increasing the {{combustor}} exit {{temperature in}} gas turbines {{is an effective}} means to increase engine power. While occasional metallurgical advances allow gradual temperature increases, improving the internal/external cooling of the blades {{is the only way}} to permit significant temperature gains. In this work, a methodology for aerodynamic and conjugate heat transfer computational analysis of cooled turbine blades is developed. Flow solutions are obtained using an implicit, three-dimensional, finite-element Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes flow solver. Efficient non-reflecting boundary conditions are derived and implemented to reduce the size of the solution domain and accelerate convergence. These are shown to be essential for the accurate capturing of shock waves and wakes. The methodology is demonstrated on the convection-cooled NASA-C 3 X turbine vane, by coupling heat conduction in the <b>solid</b> <b>vane</b> with heat transfer from the internal cooling flow and the external hot-gas flow. Both aerodynamic and heat transfer results are compared against experimental data...|$|E

40|$|The {{vane shear}} {{strength}} and total solids content of dewatered sludge from Hong Kong were determined {{in order to}} evaluate their geotechnical suitability for disposal in landfills. The results obtained indicate that (i) the total <b>solids</b> and <b>vane</b> shear strength of dewatered sludge from different treatment plants varied considerably {{depending on the type}} of sludge and dewatering method; and, (ii) percent total solids alone is not sufficient to guarantee geotechnical stability in terms of vane shear strength. The critical state model for soils provided a good fit for the characteristics relationship between vane shear strength and total solids, which can be used to estimate vane shear strength from total solids only. No relationship between volatile <b>solids</b> and <b>vane</b> shear strength was found. The results of the laboratory vane shear test correlated well with those obtained by a pocket shearmeter indicating the usefulness of this method for rapid determination of vane shear strength on site. Some factors that influence vane shear strength were briefly evaluated. Implications of the results for sludge management with special emphasis on dewatering and landfilling were discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

This paper explores dendrite coherency and the cracking transition during the equiaxed dendritic solidification of Mg alloy AZ 91 using the continuous-torque technique and vane rheometry.

5000|$|Fletching is {{traditionally}} made from bird feathers, but <b>solid</b> plastic <b>vanes</b> and thin sheet-like spin vanes are used. They are attached near the nock (rear) {{end of the}} arrow with thin double sided tape, glue, or, traditionally, sinew. The most common configuration in all cultures is three fletches, though {{as many as six}} have been used. Two makes the arrow unstable in flight. When the arrow is three-fletched, the fletches are equally spaced around the shaft, with one placed such that it is perpendicular to the bow when nocked on the string, though variations are seen with modern equipment, especially when using the modern spin vanes. This fletch is called the [...] "index fletch" [...] or [...] "cock feather" [...] (also known as [...] "the odd vane out" [...] or [...] "the nocking vane"), and the others are sometimes called the [...] "hen feathers". Commonly, the cock feather is of a different color. However, if archers are using fletching made of feather or similar material, they may use same color vanes, as different dyes can give varying stiffness to vanes, resulting in less precision. When an arrow is four-fletched, two opposing fletches are often cock feathers, and occasionally the fletches are not evenly spaced.|$|R

The structure and operating principle of the innovational vane extruder are completely different with conventional screw extruders. The process of conveying materials in vane extruder is based on volume transportation. Solids conveying zone is {{the first section of}} polymer processing in extruder. Large amounts of energy are consumed in the zone. The solids conveying process is composed of feeding, compacting and discharging process in the vane extruder. The discharging process is very unique and worthy of further study because of the particularity of the vane extruder. A mathematical model has been developed to analyze the power consumption in the process. The model shows the structural parameters have significant influence on the power consumption. In addition, the model is verified by experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the High-Pressure Turbine Fabrication Program was to demonstrate the application and feasibility of Pratt & Whitney Aircraft-developed two-piece, single crystal casting and bonding technology on the turbine blade and vane configurations required for the high-pressure turbine in the Energy Efficient Engine.

Screw compressor rotors are available in various profiles out of which “N” profile with 3 / 5 configurations is taken for the modeling and fabrication purpose.

40|$|The flow of an {{incompressible}} inviscid fluid {{through a}} turbomachine with {{infinite number of}} blades is investigated in this paper {{in order to determine}} the effects of radial forces resulting from the twist of the blades on the flow through the machine. Prandtl's method of replacing blade rows by distributed vorticity is used and the mathematical problem is treated from that point of view. The flow through the annulus between hub and outer casing of the machine is treated as two-dimensional flow between two parallel flat plates. By assuming a reasonable vorticity distribution throughout the blade row, equations are given which may be applied to calculate the flow induced by radial forces through stationary blade rows. Examples are presented for flow through free vortex and <b>solid</b> body prerotation <b>vanes</b> with radial leading edges. These examples show the effect of the radial force resulting from twist is of negligible magnitude. The effect of leaning the blades in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation is investigated. Examples shown indicate that this may be of considerable importance since by leaning the blades it is possible to reduce the axial velocity at the first stage rotor tip and thereby the relative Mach number on the rotor tip...|$|R
40|$|The jet acting {{perpendicular}} to a cross-flow boundary layer is a commonly studied complex turbulent flow. Our research {{was motivated by}} their potential application in separation delay devices, where jets {{can be used to}} produce streamwise vortices in a similar manner to conventional <b>solid</b> vortex generating <b>vanes.</b> This thesis addresses two problems; firstly the generation of inflow conditions for the simulation of a spatially developing turbulent boundary layer, and secondly the simulation of low velocity ratio jets interacting with the boundary layer. Our approach involved refining a popular turbulent inflow generation technique, validating the accuracy of our improved method against well established direct numerical simulation data. This turbulent boundary layer was used to simulate a low velocity ratio perpendicular jet test-case, which was validated against experimental data. Finally, a pitched and skewed jet model was investigated. Our modifications to the turbulent boundary layer inflow generation method were successful, addressing problems described by various authors regarding the stability and accuracy of the technique. Secondly we have found excellent agreement in our perpendicular jet in cross flow test-case, and have produced what we believe to be the first documented unsteady numerical simulation of the flow field behind a low velocity ratio pitched and skewed jet.
