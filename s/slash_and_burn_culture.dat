40|$|Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT) has {{conducted}} since 1994 several census ’ {{on the population}} of the Alaotran gentle lemur to observe the development of the population in time and space. ALAOTRA GENTLE LEMUR AND ITS THREATS The Alaotra gentle lemur or Bandro (Hapalemur griseus alaot-rensis) (Figure 1) is confined to the papyrus and reed beds of the Lake Alaotra (see Figure 2). This type of vegetation is most found in the southern parts of the lake. The population of the Alaotra lemur is suffering severe anthropogenic threats: The major pressures derive from habitat destruction mainly through fires. <b>Slash</b> <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> <b>culture</b> is mostly used to convert marshy habitat into rice paddies and to gain better access to fish ponds. Since the beginnings of the 1980 ’s, there has been a significant reduction in rain precipitation which prolongs the dry season and therefore leads to a desiccation of substantial parts of the marshes. This enhances and further propagates the <b>slash</b> <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> <b>culture.</b> Another direct population pressure is the hunting of the lemurs mainly for protein supply...|$|E
40|$|Education {{can play}} a {{critical}} role in moving farmers in developing countries away from environmentally harmful <b>slash</b> <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture. The present research examines the extent to which extension education can promote adoption of cropping systems other than <b>slash</b> <b>and</b> <b>burn.</b> Choice of cropping system by farmers in Cameroon, whether <b>slash</b> <b>and</b> <b>burn,</b> multiple crops, or mono-cropping, is modeled as a function of farm size, farmer educational level, and visits by extension personnel. Results indicate that higher visitation rates by extension personnel reduce not only the likelihood of farmers choosing <b>slash</b> <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture, but also promotes movement into mono-cropping. Since mono-cropping represents a move toward export-oriented agriculture in Cameroon, this movement may assist in promoting greater economic development across western Africa. Continued efforts in extension education are, therefore, critical in both reducing the environmental damage from <b>slash</b> <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture <b>and</b> promoting adoption of more profitable cropping systems. conservation, <b>slash</b> <b>and</b> <b>burn,</b> production technology, economic development, Farm Management,...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} paper was to document the regeneration of SF in <b>slash</b> <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture <b>and</b> to develop policy and technological recommendations for conserving forest cover on small farms and improve farmer welfare. Results confirmed that substantial areas of SF exist on <b>slash</b> <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> farms during the first few decades after settlement. As a result, over a third of the farm area is under the forest cover. This implies that deforestation in <b>slash</b> <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> farming may be less than previously believed. Soil recuperation is the most important reason for the existence of SF in <b>slash</b> <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> agriculture. The conclusion is that improved short-rotation fallows may recuperate the soil at the expense of forest cover, particularly in areas where most forest cover consists of SF...|$|R

The proposed optimal control model for charcoal production is built upon the agricultural model of <b>slash</b> <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> by Pascual <b>and</b> Barbier (2007). This theoretical model is calibrated with data from the community of Chunkanán, Campeche, Mexico. The simulation and comparison of the traditional forestry <b>slash</b> <b>and</b> <b>burn</b> management with the Forest Management Program for the Exploitation of Timber Resources (FMETR), proposed by the regulatory authority as a policy of use and conservation of forest resources, showed that the former is indeed sustainable from an ecological point of view and efficient from an economic point of view, implying that households allocate an optimal amount of work and forest biomass. ...|$|R
