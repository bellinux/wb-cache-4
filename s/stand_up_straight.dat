2500|$|The {{passengers}} mostly {{slept and}} lived in the low-ceilinged great cabins and on the main deck, which was 75 by 20 (23 m × 6 m) at most. The cabins were thin-walled and extremely cramped, and the total area was 25 ft by 15 ft (7.6 m × 4.5 m) at its largest. Below decks, any person over five feet (150 cm) tall {{would be unable to}} <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight.</b> The maximum possible space for each person would have been slightly less than the size of a standard single bed.|$|E
2500|$|Genie's {{gross motor}} skills were {{extremely}} weak; she could neither <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> nor fully straighten {{any of her}} limbs, and had very little endurance. Her movements were very hesitant and unsteady and her characteristic [...] "bunny walk", in which she held her {{hands in front of}} her like claws while ambulating, suggested extreme difficulty with sensory processing and an inability to integrate visual and tactile information. Kent was somewhat surprised to find her fine motor skills were significantly better, determining they were at approximately the level of a two-year-old. She could not chew and had very severe dysphagia, totally incapable of swallowing solid or even soft food and barely able to swallow liquids. When eating she held anything she could not swallow in her mouth until her saliva broke it down, and if this took too long she spat it out and mashed it with her fingers. She was also completely incontinent, and did not respond to extreme temperatures.|$|E

60|$|Then he <b>stood</b> <b>up,</b> <b>straight</b> and burly, {{though his}} face was a trifle flushed.|$|R
60|$|Anson's big horse <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight,</b> pawing the air, {{and came}} down with a crash. The other horses shook with terror.|$|R
60|$|No one {{had time}} to speak; for {{suddenly}} the three little shadows on the sunny wall behind them <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight,</b> and began to bow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Major, <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> {{and behave}} yourself! How {{do you expect}} me to sponge your vest when you're wriggling around in that way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{makes you}} think, Rollo," [...] said his father, without {{replying}} to James's question--"what {{makes you think}} that we could not <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> without gravitation?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you help?" [...] he asked, {{stopping}} suddenly with a {{look that}} made her <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> and strong as she answered with an eager voice: [...] "I will." ...|$|E
6000|$|They were {{obliged to}} tell Sophy {{of the state of}} things. She <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight,</b> and said, slowly and clearly, 'I do not like the world at all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She spoke not, nor turned not, [...] Nor {{any sign}} she cast, [...] Only she <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> and free, [...] Between the flowers in Athelney, [...] And the river running past.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bill <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> {{and wiped}} ’is {{face with his}} shirt-sleeve and started digging again, and then his wife just put {{something}} on and rushed downstairs {{as fast as she}} could go.|$|R
6000|$|Toto growled {{fiercely}} {{and made}} his ears <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight,</b> but the little man did not seem in the least afraid of the dog. He merely repeated: [...] "I'm the ferryman, and it's my business to carry people across the lake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, father," [...] said Rollo, [...] "that is what I meant, when I said {{we could}} not <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight.</b> I meant the houses. I read in a book that houses would be blown away, if the {{gravitation}} did not hold them down." ...|$|E
60|$|I believe 'e {{told his}} 'ands wot I said; anyway, two bits o' coke missed me by 'arf an inch next evening, {{and for some}} weeks not one of 'em spoke a word to me. When they see me coming they just used to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> and twist their nose.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the bottom}} of the blade flat on the ice, a higher lie value causes the shaft to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straighter.</b> [...] Typical values range from 5 to 7; most sticks now are near 5.5. [...] Goalie sticks {{typically}} have a lie between 11 and 15.|$|R
60|$|They {{were close}} {{to the line of}} surf now; they had passed it, indeed, a little on the left, and the boat was drifting. She <b>stood</b> <b>up,</b> <b>straight</b> and stern, and her face, as she looked towards the land, was lit with the fire of the prophetess.|$|R
6000|$|Peggy <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight,</b> let {{her arms}} hang {{close to her}} sides, and looked steadfastly forth. [...] "Wot's comin', Miss Rob," [...] said she, [...] "is the buggy 'longin' to Mister Michaels, at de Springs, an' his ole mud-colored hoss is haulin' it. Dem dat's in it is Mahs' Junius an' Mister Crof'." ...|$|R
60|$|So well I am, dear Mr. Westwood, and {{so happy}} after a year's {{trial of the}} stuff of marriage, happier than ever, perhaps, and the {{revolution}} is so complete {{that one has to}} learn to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> and steadily (like a landsman in a sailing ship) before one can do any work with one's hand and brain.|$|E
6000|$|... "The boy {{served the}} young fellow right, sir," [...] growled Fred Bayham in his deepest voice. [...] "Come along, young man. <b>Stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight,</b> {{and keep a}} civil tongue in your head next time, mind you, when you dine with gentlemen. It's easy to see," [...] says Fred, looking round with a knowing air, [...] "that this young man hasn't got the usages of society--he's not been {{accustomed}} to it:" [...] and he led the dandy out.|$|E
6000|$|Next spoke Undabuko, Dabulamanzi and Magwenga, {{brothers}} of the king, who all favoured war, {{though the two}} last were guarded in their speech. After these came Uhamu, the king's uncle--he who {{was said to be}} the son of a Spirit--who was strong for peace, urging that the king should submit {{to the demands of the}} English, making the best terms he could, that he [...] "should bend like a reed before the storm, so that after the storm had swept by, he might <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> again, and with him all the other reeds of the people of the Zulus." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{she spoke}} the steamer slid and lifted off the reef. For {{a few moments}} she wallowed; then {{suddenly}} her stern settled, her prow rose slowly in the air till it <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight,</b> fifty or sixty feet of it. Then, with a majestic, but hideous rush, down went the Trondhjem and vanished for ever.|$|R
6000|$|High in {{the wreck}} I held the cup, [...] I {{clutched}} my rusty sword, [...] I cocked my tattered feather [...] To {{the glory of}} the Lord. [...] Not undone were the heaven and earth, [...] This hollow world thrown up, [...] Before one man had <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight!</b> [...] And drained it like a cup.|$|R
60|$|The next {{instant the}} {{automobile}} {{had come with}} a catastrophic jar against an iron object. The instant after that four men had crawled {{out from under a}} chaos of metal, and a tall lean lamp-post that had <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> {{on the edge of the}} marine parade stood out, bent and twisted, like the branch of a broken tree.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then Susie {{uttered a}} cry of grief, and {{understood}} the truth. Her husband was indeed dead, but had been stuffed and mounted upon the limb to appear as he had in life. Small wires had been pushed through his legs to make his poor body <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight,</b> and to Susie's horror she discovered that his eyes were only bits of glass! All the other birds in the room were stuffed in the same way. They {{looked as if they}} were alive, at the first glance; but each body was cold and every voice mute. They were mere mockeries of the beautiful birds that this heartless and cruel man had deprived of their joyous lives.|$|E
60|$|This {{place was}} a {{tolerable}} long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most {{up to the top}} on the side towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together, and Jim could <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> in it. It was cool in there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.|$|E
6000|$|... was {{of such a}} kind as to astonish {{the natives}} among whom he dwelt. The {{recollection}} of a fall he once had, when his skate caught on a stone, still lingers in the district. A boy {{had been sent to}} sweep the snow from the White Moss Tarn for him. ‘Did Mr. Wudsworth gie ye owt?’ he was asked, when he returned from his labour. ‘Na, but I seed him tumlle, though!’ was the answer. ‘He was a ter’ble girt skater, was Wudsworth now,’ says one of Mr. Rawnsley’s informants; ‘he would put one hand i’ his breast (he wore a frill shirt i’ them days), and t’ other hand i’ his waistband, same as shepherds does to keep their hands warm, and he would <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> and sway and swing away grandly.’ ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was as much}} {{moved as}} he. ‘I could almost beg you to do otherwise,’ I said. ‘I was a brute to come to you, a brute and a coward. You are a noble enemy; you will make a noble soldier.’ And with rather a happy idea of a {{compliment}} for this warlike youth, I <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> {{and gave him the}} salute.|$|R
60|$|So we circled {{him once}} more. The sea was beautifully smooth, with the slow swells gently heaving. The {{swordfish}} rode them lazily and indifferently. His dorsal <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> and stiff, {{and the big}} sickle-shaped tail-fin wove to and fro behind. I gazed at them longingly, in despair, as unattainable. I knew of nothing in the fishing game as tantalizing and despairing as this sight.|$|R
60|$|And Hob put a stout {{headless}} lance in the boy's hand, while Simon <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> before him. Hob {{adjusted the}} weapon in his inert hand, {{and told him}} how and where to strike. But 'It is not in sooth. I don't want to hurt Master Simon,' said the child, as they laughed, and yet with displeasure as his blow fell weak and uncertain.|$|R
60|$|Two {{of these}} winding tunnels stand {{as proof of}} Nature's mining abilities. Their floors are level, they are seven feet wide, and their roofs are gently arched. Their height is not uniform, however. We passed through one a hundred feet long, which leads through a spur {{of the hill and}} opens out well up in the sheer wall of a precipice whose foot rests in the waves of the sea. It is a commodious tunnel, except that there are {{occasional}} places in it where one must stoop to pass under. The roof is lava, of course, and is thickly studded with little lava-pointed icicles an inch long, which hardened as they dripped. They project as closely together as the iron teeth of a corn-sheller, and if one will <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> and walk any distance there, he can get his hair combed free of charge.|$|E
60|$|Health {{is simply}} Nature, and no naturalist {{ought to have}} the impudence to {{understand}} it. Health, one may say, is God; and no agnostic has any right to claim His acquaintance. For God must mean, among other things, that mystical and multitudinous balance of all things, by which they are at least able to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> and endure; and any scientist who pretends to have exhausted this subject of ultimate sanity, I will call the lowest of religious fanatics. I will allow him to understand the madman, for the madman is an exception. But if he says he understands the sane man, then he says he has the secret of the Creator. For whenever you and I feel fully sane, we are quite incapable of naming the elements that make up that mysterious simplicity. We can no more analyse such peace in the soul than we can conceive in our heads the whole enormous and dizzy equilibrium by which, out of suns roaring like infernos and heavens toppling like precipices, He has hanged the world upon nothing.|$|E
6000|$|Outside, {{he walked}} a few steps, then stood {{looking back at}} the windows of the hall through some trees, the shadows of whose trunks, in the light of a street lamp, were spilled out along the ground like the splines of a fan. A church clock struck eleven. For hours yet she would be there, going round and round in the arms of Youth! Try as he might he could never {{recapture}} for himself the look that Oliver's face had worn--the look that was the symbol of so much more than he himself could give her. Why had she come into his life--to her undoing, and his own? And the bizarre thought came to him: If she were dead should I really care? Should I not be almost glad? If she were dead her witchery would be dead, and I could <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> again and look people in the face! What was this power that played with men, darted into them, twisted their hearts to rags; this power that had looked through her eyes when she put her fan, with his flowers, to her lips? ...|$|E
5000|$|It is {{permissible}} {{to make the}} qunut before going into ruku (bowing), {{or it may be}} recited when one <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> after the ruku. Humaid says: [...] "I asked Anas: 'Is the qunut before or after the ruku?' he said: 'We would do it before or after." [...] This hadith was related by Ibn Majah and Muhammad ibn Nasr. In Fath al-Bari, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani comments that its chain is faultless.|$|R
50|$|The lie of a stick {{refers to}} the angle between the shaft and the blade. A lie value of 5 {{corresponds}} to a 135° angle, and each additional lie value corresponds to a 2° smaller angle.With {{the bottom of the}} blade flat on the ice, a higher lie value causes the shaft to <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>straighter.</b> Typical values range from 5 to 7; most sticks now are near 5.5. Goalie sticks typically have a lie between 11 and 15.|$|R
6000|$|At {{once the}} Master became grave, and he leaned upon his ax and stroked his grizzled beard thoughtfully for many minutes. Then {{suddenly}} he <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight,</b> and poised his powerful head with firm resolve, {{and stretched out}} his great right arm as if determined on doing some mighty deed. For a thought {{had come to him}} so grand in its conception that all the world might well bow before the Master Woodsman and honor his name forever! ...|$|R
