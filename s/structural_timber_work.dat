The stiffness and strength distributions were compared with the typical distribution of wood density, which reveals that the wood density alone does not reflect the mechanical properties of radiata pine <b>structural</b> <b>timber,</b> because: 1) the denser butt logs exhibited the lowest stiffness among all log types; 2) the butt logs were not the strongest logs compared with other log types.

In order to estimate the failure strength non-destructively, this study examined the failure features of the weakest point in detail, including the local stiffness at the failure zone, the failure pattern of knots and the failure frequency in relation to growth and features of knots. The results of this study reveal that non-destructive estimation of strength at the likely weakest point in <b>structural</b> <b>timber</b> is possible...|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} method of roof framing {{employed}} by Australian builders in modern construction {{is the use}} of pre-fabricated nail plated timber roof trusses. These trusses are predominantly manufactured from <b>structural</b> framing <b>timber</b> limited in length to a maximum of 6 metres. The style and size of houses increasingly preferred by Australian homeowners means that trusses are regularly required to span further than 6 metres. Truss manufacturers therefore use larger or additional nail plates to splice members during fabrication, and the assembly process becomes far more complex. Finger jointing of sawmill off-cuts and other short lengths of timber is a means of manufacturers economically producing timber in longer lengths. This dissertation investigates the suitability of using finger jointed <b>structural</b> <b>timber</b> for the fabrication of nail plated roof trusses. Physical testing and statistical analysis has been used to compare the performance of finger jointed <b>structural</b> <b>timber</b> with standard <b>structural</b> framing <b>timber</b> normally used in truss fabrication. This study involved characterizing the mechanical properties of the timber, as well as assessing the performance of joints including mechanical fasteners. These methods, along with the static modelling of loading situations, were also used to quantify the probability of inducing failures unique to finger jointed timber, during the truss fabrication and erection process. These investigations concluded that finger jointed timber could be produced with equivalent mechanical properties to standard framing timber. Joints manufactured from finger jointed and solid <b>structural</b> <b>timber</b> also exhibited no significant difference in performance. Furthermore, failures unique to finger jointed timber could occur during fabrication and erection, however, the probability of these, under normal use conditions, is generally quite low. ...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of the {{three-dimensional}} orthogonal directions of wood material at any position within a tree {{is necessary for}} the understanding of strength reducing effects of knots and essential for the continuation of research in areas which relate small clear wood specimen behavior to the behavior of full size <b>structural</b> <b>timber.</b> A complete three-dimensional paradigm describing the geometry of knots and related fiber distortion, initially derived to predict the strength-reducing behavior of knots in <b>structural</b> <b>timber</b> of Norway Spruce with the finite element method, is presented in this article. Besides strength prediction analyses, it is believed that the paradigm may be useful in other areas of research on <b>structural</b> <b>timber</b> that are effected by fiber orientation, such as drying and form change of <b>structural</b> <b>timber.</b> The paradigm generates fiber orientation in any position within a log or lumber from assumed fiber patterns in planes parallel to the longitudinal direction of the original tree. Fiber patterns in the radial and tangential directions are derived from physical restraints related to fiber production within the annual increase surfaces of the tree and from theories of knot formation. The adaptability of the paradigm allows practically any softwood knot to be modeled with an accuracy that is limited only by input-data. The knot-axis may be non-linear, and the knot cross-section oval with its vertical and horizontal axis increasing from the pith of the stem at chosen rates. Spiral grain may also be included in the paradigm and vary with the annual growth layers. Investigations presented in this article showed that generated fiber orientations for Picea abies complied well with measured fiber distortions, and that the general trends of fiber orientation, explained by the applied knot formation theory, is reflected in the measured specimens...|$|R
40|$|This is the author's {{accepted}} manuscript. The {{final version}} {{has been published}} in Architectural Research Quarterly here: [URL] Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2014 Architects, engineers, and researchers alike often cite practical reasons for building with wood. Since the development of curved glulam beams and columns over a century ago, {{the widespread use of}} massive <b>structural</b> <b>timber</b> elements has allowed architects and engineers to design and build in wood with unprecedented speed and scale. Moreover, rising concerns of climate change and the carbon dioxide emissions associated with construction encourage the use of wood as a viable alternative to steel and concrete, due to CO 2 sequestration in trees. In mid- and high-rise buildings, the current shift from steel and concrete towards massive <b>structural</b> <b>timber</b> elements like glulam, laminated-veneer lumber (LVL), and cross-laminated timber (CLT) is evident in a number of recently completed timber buildings in Europe, ranging from seven to nine storeys. Several speculative design proposals have also been made for ‘timber towers’ of 30, 42 and even 65 storeys, recognising that designing with massive <b>structural</b> <b>timber</b> elements in high-rise buildings is still in its infancy. This paper offers a new perspective on building with wood at this scale, beyond carbon sequestration and construction. Criticism of existing projects and proposals, including the authors’ own previous design work, is used to highlight the shortcomings of thinking about wood purely as a substitute material for steel and concrete in tall buildings. Two positive case studies are used to further show how wood offers new opportunities for architects and engineers to engage with the materiality, tectonics, and structure of mid- and high-rise without neglecting wider urban, cultural, and social issues. This discussion seeks to begin a debate on the future role and wider use of <b>structural</b> <b>timber</b> in contemporary architecture...|$|R
40|$|Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) {{represents}} around 16 % of {{the area}} of commercial conifer plantations in Great Britain, but around 30 % in north and north-eastern Scotland. Most of the timber produced from these forests goes into lower-value markets such as fencing and panel products, and only a small proportion is converted into high-value <b>structural</b> <b>timber.</b> In order to maximise financial returns from this resource in the medium and long term, {{it will be necessary}} to increase the outturn of <b>structural</b> <b>timber.</b> However, this requires knowledge of the variation in those wood properties that influence <b>structural</b> <b>timber</b> performance and of the effects of silviculture on wood quality. Changes in silvicultural practices in recent decades—wider initial spacings, a preference for artificial regeneration, and an increased use of mechanised thinnings, have led to concerns about the suitability of Scots pine timber for use in structural applications due to potentially poorer stem form, a greater proportion of juvenile wood and larger, more numerous knots. As part of the research presented here, novel predictive equations were developed for the key physical, mechanical and branching properties that determine <b>structural</b> <b>timber</b> quality in Scots pine, namely: microfibril angle, wood density, clearwood bending strength and stiffness, and branch number, size, insertion angle and status (alive or dead). Simulations were carried out using these equations to examine the effects of different silvicultural regimes on each wood and branch property of interest. Based on these simulations it is recommended that in order to produce high quality Scots pine timber, trees are planted at narrower initial spacings and grown on longer rotations than currently prescribed, and, where appropriate, thinnings should be delayed. Together, these measures will restrict final branch size and the amount of mechanically inferior juvenile wood in the final crop. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
