40|$|ABSTRACT. A decisive {{criterion}} for {{the selection of}} the optimal press line within the press shop's layout plan is the required press force. The press force necessary to form the component is defined significantly by the <b>stroke</b> <b>range</b> and the corresponding bottom dead centre. The latter finalises the embossing process commonly used for reinforced structures on body components. The high forces required hereby strongly impact the deformation behaviour of the tool and the press and result in force requirements specific to individual presses. This paper examines the significant influences on the maximum force requirements. Examinations of the force requirements using parameter studies on bending, bulge test as well as embossing tests will be presented. The impact of the presses and tools rigidity was determined by way of extensive measurements performed on a mechanical and on a hydraulic press. The decisive criterion here is the bottom dead centre, which can be reproducibly determined using a simple and reliable measurement technique...|$|E

40|$|Background & objectives: There {{has been}} more than 100 per cent {{increase}} in incidence of stroke in low- and middle-income countries including India from 1970 - 1979 to 2000 - 2008. Lack of reliable reporting mechanisms, heterogeneity in methodology, study population, and small sample size in existing epidemiological studies, make an accurate estimation of stroke burden in India challenging. We conducted a systematic review of epidemiologic studies on stroke conducted in India to document the magnitude of stroke. Methods: All population-based, cross-sectional studies and cohort studies from India which reported the stroke incidence rate or cumulative stroke incidence and/or the prevalence of stroke in participants from any age group were included. Electronic databases (Ovid, PubMed, Medline, Embase and IndMED) were searched and studies published during 1960 to 2015 were included. A total of 3079 independent titles were identified for screening, of which 10 population-based cross-sectional studies were considered eligible for inclusion. Given the heterogeneity of the studies, meta-analysis was not carried out. Results: The cumulative incidence of <b>stroke</b> <b>ranged</b> from 105 to 152 / 100, 000 persons per year, and the crude prevalence of <b>stroke</b> <b>ranged</b> from 44. 29 to 559 / 100, 000 persons {{in different parts of the}} country during the past decade.

For a lightning stroke, {{the ratio of}} its electrical and magnetic fields at ground is theoretically {{a function of the}} frequency and distance to the stroke. Distance of the stroke can then be obtained by fitting the theoretical function with the observed data. The approach was examined by applying it to broadband VLF/LF electrical and magnetic fields observed simultaneously at one station for several <b>strokes</b> in <b>ranges</b> of 10 - 50 km. Furthermore, a prototypal single-station lightning location system (S-LLS), which can be analogized to a modified VLF/LF broadband magnetic direction-finder programmed with the proposed lightning stroke distance determining approach, was built up and tested.

Case reportA case is presented in which on-table intra-cranial angiography and catheter directed thrombolysis were used for a thromboembolic occlusion of the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) and proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA). An 83 -year-old lady developed a dense right hemiparesis while undergoing a CEA under local anaesthetic (LA). Immediate re-exploration of the endarterectomy did not reveal technical error. Intraoperative duplex scanning of the internal carotid artery revealed no detectable diastolic flow. On-table angiogram showed complete occlusion of the distal ICA and proximal MCA. Catheter directed administration of TPA was undertaken. The entire ICA and MCA were completely clear on a completion angiogram. The patient made a full neurological recovery.

The onset time of {{swallowing}} rehabilitation following stroke {{has an important}} role in the recovery of dysphagia and preventing of its complications, but it was either highly variable or was not stated in previous trials. The aim of this study was investigation effects of onset time of swallowing therapy on recovery from dysphagia following stroke. Methods: Sixty dysphagia patients due to <b>stroke</b> <b>range</b> of age 60 - 74 (67. 1 ± 3. 8), participated in this randomized clinical trial study. The patients allocated in Early, Medium and Late groups, on the base of initiation of swallowing therapy after the stroke. After basic clinical and video fluoroscopic swallowing study assessments, traditional swallowing therapy was initiated 3 times per week for 3 months. The outcome measures were North-Western dysphagia patient check sheet, functional oral intake scale, video fluoroscopy, and frequency of pneumonia. Statistical analysis was done by repeated measure ANOVA, Bonferroni and χ 2 tests. Results: Three groups of patients in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in the pre-treatment P > 0. 050. Onset time of swallowing therapy after stroke was effective on swallowing recovery on the main outcome variables. So that in first group patients, recovery was rather than other groups P < 0. 050.

Although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) effectively treats SDB, compliance is low. The objective {{of the present study}} was to assess the tolerance and the efficacy of a continuous high-flow-rate air administered through an open nasal cannula (transnasal insufflation, TNI), a less-intrusive method, to treat SDB in acute stroke patients. METHODS: Ten patients (age, 56. 8 ± 10. 7 years), with SDB ranging from moderate to severe (apnea-hypopnea index, AHI, > 15 /h of sleep) and on a standard sleep study at a mean of 4. 8 ± 3. 7 days after ischemic <b>stroke</b> (<b>range,</b> 1 - 15 days), were selected. The night after, they underwent a second sleep study while receiving TNI (18 L/min). RESULTS: TNI was well tolerated by all patients. For the entire group, TNI decreased the AHI from 40. 4 ± 25. 7 to 30. 8 ± 25. 7 /h (p = 0. 001) and the oxygen desaturation index > 3 % from 40. 7 ± 28. 4 to 31 ± 22. 5 /h (p = 0. 02). All participants except one showed a decrease in AHI. The percentage of slow-wave sleep significantly increased with TNI from 16. 7 ± 8. 2 % to 22. 3 ± 7. 4 % (p = 0. 01). There was also a trend toward a reduction in markers of sleep disruption (number of awakenings, arousal index). CONCLUSIONS: TNI improves SDB indices, and possibly sleep parameters, in stroke patients. Although these changes are modest, our findings suggest that TNI is a viable treatment alternative to CPAP in patients with SDB in the acute phase of ischemic stroke...|$|E

The TIAregistry. org project was designed to describe the contemporary profile, etiologic factors, and outcomes in patients with a TIA or minor ischemic stroke who receive care in health systems that now offer urgent evaluation by stroke specialists. We recruited patients who had had a TIA or minor stroke within the previous 7 days. Sites were selected if they had systems dedicated to urgent evaluation of patients with TIA. We estimated the 1 -year risk of stroke and of the composite outcome of stroke, an acute coronary syndrome, or death from cardiovascular causes. We also examined the association of the ABCD(2) score for the risk of <b>stroke</b> (<b>range,</b> 0 [lowest risk] to 7 [highest risk]), findings on brain imaging, and cause of TIA or minor stroke with the risk of recurrent stroke over a period of 1 year. From 2009 through 2011, we enrolled 4789 patients at 61 sites in 21 countries. A total of 78. 4 % of the patients were evaluated by stroke specialists within 24 hours after symptom onset. A total of 33. 4 % of the patients had an acute brain infarction, 23. 2 % had at least one extracranial or intracranial stenosis of 50 % or more, and 10. 4 % had atrial fibrillation. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the 1 -year event rate of the composite cardiovascular outcome was 6. 2 % (95 % confidence interval, 5. 5 to 7. 0). Kaplan-Meier estimates of the stroke rate at days 2, 7, 30, 90, and 365 were 1. 5 %, 2. 1 %, 2. 8 %, 3. 7 %, and 5. 1 %, respectively. In multivariable analyses, multiple infarctions on brain imaging, large-artery atherosclerosis, and an ABCD(2) score of 6 or 7 were each associated with more than a doubling of the risk of stroke.

The NuDrive is a detachable lever-propulsion system that enables an upright posture, potentially beneficial in preventing back problems. It also provides a continuous grip, very suitable for users with a limited hand function. These advantages make the NuDrive an interesting option for rehabilitation. However, using the NuDrive adequately is suggested to require a process of adaptation, i. e. motor learning. Therefore, we investigated the effects of three weeks of practice on technique and efficiency. Methods Inexperienced able-bodied male participants were randomly divided over an experimental (EXP, n= 8) and a control group (CON, n= 8). Pre- and posttest for both groups were three weeks apart and consisted of three consecutive 4 min bouts of sub-maximal exercise, with 2 min rest in between. EXP performed seven practice trials spread over the three weeks, to {{become more and more}} familiarized to the lever-propulsion. These trials consisted of two consecutive 4 min bouts of sub-maximal exercise, with 2 min rest in between. All tests and trials were performed on a motorized treadmill (0. 30 W/kg, 1, 11 m/s). Changes in technique were measured using: stroke frequency, push time(PT), cycle time(CT), hand-speed and lever range of motion (lever ROM). Learning effects were quantified using gross mechanical efficiency (GME). Statistics: ANOVA p> 0. 05 Results PT(EXP:CON;+ 0. 11 (� 0. 10) s:+ 0. 02 (� 0. 02) s) and lever ROM (+ 12. 8 (� 14. 1) deg: + 1. 1 (� 4. 3) deg) increased, where maximal hand-speed during the push phase (EXP:CON;- 0. 17 (� 0. 14) m/s: 0. 0 (� 0. 09) m/s) decreased more in EXP compared to CON, indicating that EXP participants shifted to a movement pattern with a longer <b>stroke</b> <b>range</b> and slower movement of the hands: a longer-slower movement pattern. Some indication of an increased GME was found, however, nothing conclusive, potentially due to a low participant number in the GME analysis (EXP, n= 5; CON, n= 7).

40|$|Introduction: Different {{models of}} {{tractors}} have been imported from foreign countries or assembled in Iran for many years. Consistency of foreign manufactured products with native specifications and {{the improvement of}} locally manufactured tractors are important problems that must be considered. Moreover, tractor dimensions, sitting space and some other important {{factors such as the}} ability of Iranian users to operate them must be taken into consideration. In this study, we surveyed the proper proportion of tractors dimension, location of control tools and driver’s work space, with Iranian users’ anthropometric data of drivers from five provinces. Human factors are of paramount importance in developing farm machinery given that these machines will often be operated by persons with minimum skills. Therefore, farm machinery should be made simple to operate and as free from hazards as possible. Materials and methods: Firstly, the anthropometric data for 250 users 20 - 60 years old was calculated. The drivers were selected randomly. Then the specifications of 4 tractors including: Ferguson 285, Ferguson 399, Valtra and New Holland were compared with the anthropometric data of user in 5 th and 95 th percentile value and their adaptation was studied. Anthropometric Data of subjects consisted of: standing height, full hand length, popliteal length, seat pan width, seat pan depth, elbow height, seat back support height, hand pan width, hand grip and full-leg length. Getting on the tractor is the first contact of an operator with a tractor. In assessing the suitability of the provision made for getting on the tractor, an experiment was arranged in which operators tried to get on 3 tractors. The mode of getting on the tractors, the agony on the operator’s face, the muscular reactions and individual opinion on the difficulties or comfort while undertaking the task were observed and recorded. The specifications of tractors compared with Anthropometric Data were measured, whiles the tractors were positioned on a level ground for measurements after the tires had been ganged. These specifications were tractor height, steering wheel height, footrest height, foot set height; tractor seat geometry as seat pan width, seat pan depth and seat pan support height; steering geometry as distance of steering wheel from seat reference point, steering wheel radius, steering wheel thickness, steering wheel inclination to the horizontal and seat reach adjustment; levers and pedals distance from seat reference point as gear lever, parking brake lever, hydraulic control lever, clutch pedal, accelerator pedal, brake pedal, front panel, workspace width and workspace length. Results and Discussion: The experiment that was conducted with operators attempting to get on the tractors indicated that tractor steps heights were higher than the desirable limit. Therefore, based on the ideas of the researcher and tractors drivers, getting on all tractors is difficult. With {{an increase in the number}} of steps or a decrease in their heights, the desirable condition can be created. Seat depth of new Holland and Valtra tractors were great for drivers in the 5 th percentile value. A variable thickness pad can solve this problem. Results of studies indicated that Seat depth of Massey Ferguson 285 and 399 was shorter than driver’s leg length of 95 th percentile value. To solve the problem an increase of 10 centimeters to pad height of these tractors was suggested. Seat pad of tractors were short for drivers in the 95 th percentile value. Distance of steering wheel from seat reference point (SRP) in Massey Ferguson 285 and Valtra was further than drivers hand length in the 5 th percentile value. Therefore, the drivers hand is short for driver’s good operation. Surveys indicated that drivers had problems for gear lever access in Massey Ferguson 399. Therefore, for good access on gear lever we must increase seat <b>stroke</b> <b>range</b> by 5 - 10 centimeters. The record available from Meteorological Organization indicated that air temperature and rain throughout the year in the study area is between 20 to 40 degrees Celsius and 100 to 300 mm change. Valtra and New Holland tractors having a driver cabs with heating and cooling equipment have the ideal space for the performance of their driver. Massey Ferguson 285 tractor does not have any driver cab and Roll Over Protection Structure (ROPS). Conclusions: This research was conducted in five provinces of Iran to assess ergonomics of some commonly and new used tractors in Iran containing Ferguson 285, Ferguson 399, Valtra and New Holland. As there was no data base with required details, data was collected directly by personal contact with tractor users. A questionnaire was filled out for each person and anthropometric data was calculated in all provinces for 250 users 20 - 60 year old that were selected at random. Then relevant specifications of 4 tractors were measured and compared with the relevant anthropometric data of users in the 5 th and 95 th percentile value and their adaptation was studied. The results indicated that tractor steps, Seat depth, distance of steering wheel and distance of some levers and pedals from seat reference point should be amended...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There is an {{important}} need {{to better understand the}} activities of individual patients with stroke outside of structured therapy since this activity is likely to have a profound influence on recovery. A case-study approach was used to examine the activity levels and associated physiological load of patients with stroke throughout a day. Methods Activities and physiologic measures were recorded during a continuous 8 hour period from 4 individuals in the sub-acute stage following <b>stroke</b> (<b>ranging</b> from 49 to 80 years old; 4 to 8 weeks post-stroke) in an in-patient rehabilitation hospital. Results Both heart rate (p = 0. 0207) and ventilation rate (p Conclusion Activity levels of individuals with stroke during the day were generally low, though task-related changes in physiologic measures were observed. Large variability in the physiological response to even the activities deemed to be greatest intensity suggests that inclusion of such extended measurement of physiologic measures may improve understanding of physiological profile that could guide elements of the physical therapy prescription. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{test the}} {{reproducibility}} of the ABILOCO questionnaire. To validate the patient self-reporting method and the third-party {{assessment of the}} stroke patients' locomotion ability by a treating physical therapist. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Adult stroke patients (N= 28; 59 +/- 13 y). The time since <b>stroke</b> <b>ranged</b> from 3 to 253 weeks. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The ABILOCO questionnaire. RESULTS: The results of patient self-assessment {{and the results of}} the third-party assessments by the physiotherapists at a 2 -week interval were highly correlated (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=. 77 and ICC=. 89, respectively). The results of the patient self-assessment and the third-party assessment by the physical therapist were both well correlated to assessment by an independent medical examiner who observed the patient during the 13 ABILOCO activities (ICC=. 69 and ICC=. 87, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The use of ABILOCO as a self-reporting questionnaire is a valid and reproducible method for assessing locomotion ability in patients with stroke in daily clinical practice and research...|$|R
40|$|The {{reported}} {{annual incidence}} of juvenile <b>stroke</b> <b>ranges</b> from 9 to 47 cases per 100, 000 inhabitants. We sought {{to estimate the}} incidence of first-ever stroke in young adults through a population-based stroke registry in a well-defined and stable population. We planned to collect all cases of new stroke in people aged 15 - 44  years in Ferrara, Italy, over the period 2002 - 2007. During the surveillance period, a first-ever stroke was diagnosed in 39 patients, giving a mean annual crude incidence rate of 12. 1 cases per 100, 000 person-years (95 % CI 8. 6 - 16. 5), 9. 1 when adjusted to the European population. The overall 30 -day case fatality rate was 7. 7, 21. 4 % for hemorrhagic stroke. The incidence rate was {{in the range of}} estimates detected in western countries. The case-fatality rate was lower than that reported in less recent studies. The stroke subtype predicted the probability of death and the outcome...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effect of BWSTT on paretic limb {{function}} using the outcome measures of overground walking velocity, paretic leg propulsion, and the mechanical work produced by the hip, knee, and ankle of the paretic limb. Thirteen participants with chronic <b>stroke,</b> <b>ranging</b> in age from 40 to 80 years, completed 24 sessions of BWSTT over eight weeks. Overground walking velocity and bilateral kinematics and kinetics were collected prior to and following completion of the BWSTT intervention. All participants exhibited statistically significant increases in overground walking velocity post BWSTT. Neither the propulsive impulse of the paretic limb, relative to total propulsive impulse, nor the relative contribution of the paretic hip, knee, and ankle to total positive work significantly changed post BWSTT. The results suggest that paretic limb function remains unchanged following BWSTT, despite improvements in overground walking velocity.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop a}} {{questionnaire}} (ABILOCO), {{based on the}} Rasch measurement model, that can assess locomotion ability in adult stroke patients (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health activity domain). DESIGN: Prospective study and questionnaire development. SETTING: A faculty hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Adult stroke patients (N= 100) (age, 64 +/- 15 y). The time since <b>stroke</b> <b>ranged</b> from 1 to 260 weeks. INTERVENTION: A preliminary questionnaire included 43 items representing a large sample of locomotion activities. This questionnaire was tested on the 100 stroke patients, and their responses were analyzed using the Rasch model (RUMM 2020 software) to select items that had an ordered rating scale and fitted a unidimensional model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The ABILOCO questionnaire. RESULTS: The retained items resulted in a 13 -item questionnaire, which includes {{a wide range of}} locomotion abilities well targeted to the sample population, leading to good reliability (R=. 93). The item calibration was independent of age, sex, time since stroke, and affected side. The concurrent validity of ABILOCO was also investigated by comparing it with well-known, criterion standard scales (Functional Walking Category, Functional Ambulation Categories, item 12 of the FIM instrument evaluating walking ability) and the walking speed measured with the 10 -meter walk test. CONCLUSIONS: The ABILOCO questionnaire presents good psychometric qualities to measure locomotion ability in adult <b>stroke</b> patients. Its <b>range</b> and measurement precision make it attractive for clinical use throughout the rehabilitation process and for clinical research...|$|R
