40|$|The {{color of}} natural dyes, as anthocyanins, is very easily {{changing}} as he temperature changes. The color {{change can be}} used as a color indicator to provide information about product deterioration due to its sensitivity toward temperature and light. This indicator is called <b>smart</b> <b>label</b> of color indicator. This film label can be made of chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol and extract of erpa (Aerva sanguinolenta) leaves. The extraction was done under various leaf:water ratios. The filming was done in 2 methods, i. e. (i) by mixing the extract into film solution and drying the film at 50 C; and (ii) by brushing the extract on the film surface. The leaf extract had a pH of 5. 09 and the total yield of 116. 65 mg anthocyanin/ 100 g leaves. Filming of color indicator in mixing method and dried at 50 C resulted a colorless film. Brushing method was the best method to produce <b>smart</b> <b>label</b> with quite stable property and 1 mL extract could be applied evenly per 40 cm 2 film area.

40|$|Abstract—The {{development}} of Organic Electronics (OE) is pro-moted {{by the promise}} of being ultra-low cost technology in the future. One key application scenario is item level tagging, e. g., smart packaging, where items are equipped with organic printed tags using Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology. However, current OE allows the printing of simple tags with ultra-low hardware complexity, but the printing of RFID chips with large numbers of transistors that implement RFID anti-collision protocols are far away from realization. In this paper, we present one sensor-based and fully functional passive RFID tag implementing collective communications a proprietary transmis-sion protocol. Based on OE constraints, we describe the printable passive <b>smart</b> <b>label</b> down to the logic gate layer. Further on, we present an external clock synchronization strategy required by the passive reader system. Additionally, we provide a feasibility assessment towards printing the <b>smart</b> <b>label,</b> and conclude with simulating the proposed reader system.

40|$|Abstract—For item-level tagging in supply {{chains and}} {{logistics}} the massive deployment of current RFID tags {{is still too}} costly despite a drastic decline in price. Therefore, efforts are made in developing organic and printed electronics to enable the vision of item-level tagging. This novel technology promises to overcome the current cost constraints and become ubiquitous. However, the constraints of organic and printed electronics allow merely the design of simple circuitry, which means that neither processor nor larger integrated circuits can be printed. In addition, the lack of high-performance in organic electronics does not even allow the application of traditional communication protocols. The high communication load between reader and tags based on traditional communication schemes is not practical e. g. for regular compliance checks of pallets with up to 1000 items. In this paper, we propose a solution for a <b>smart</b> <b>label</b> system based on {{the constraints of the}} organic and printed electronics. The communication scheme uses simultaneous transmission of sensory data. We further present an analog circuitry for an tag specially tailored for the deployment of smart labels in a scenario such as the maintenance of perishables in a cool chain. The approach exploits the possibilities of printing irreversible sensor indicators and randomized structures when using organic electronics. Further on, we show first experimental results per-formed in our <b>smart</b> <b>label</b> test bed, and illustrate its business relevance towards managing massive amounts of tags in a short time frame.

40|$|Dye based {{solar cells}} {{have been studied}} {{thoroughly}} in recent years. However, using this technology for dye based light sensors in polymer based systems offers several advantages compared to classical devices. A printable light sensor could be easily integrated into current <b>smart</b> <b>label</b> fabrication processes. Moreover, printable light sensors combined with novel conductive polymers could solve reliability issues resulting from bonding processes. In this paper {{we report on the}} fabrication of dye based light sensors using Ruthenium 535 -bis-TBA as active dye and Iodide solution as charge transporting layer. A prototype has been developed and tested successfully. In order to improve the technology towards <b>smart</b> <b>label</b> integration, silica gel has been used to harden the Iodide liquid electrolyte. Depending on the silica gel concentrations, different stiffness levels can be achieved. Whereas the first light sensor prototypes have been made on glass substrates, the new ones are based on polymer substrates. The polymer foil KAPTON by Du Pont has been used as substrate. Special care has to be taken regarding the preparation of the transparent electrodes. The transparent conductive oxide (TCO) Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), which has been used as transparent electrode, has to be cured at elevated temperatures. In conclusion we have shown that dye based light sensors can be used for the integration into smart labels. Moreover modifications in the process lead to a light sensor which is compatible to future polymer based systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} {{monitoring of}} sensitive and valuable goods requires, besides {{the storage of}} logistic data, the record of climate and ambient conditions. Therefore the acquisition of physical values like temperature, humidity, pressure, acceleration and inclination is necessary. Commercially available data logger devices are expensive and sizable. A cost effective alternative are active smart radio frequency identification (RFID) label containing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). By integration of sensors, display and autonomous energy supply in a passive RFID <b>label,</b> wireless <b>smart</b> systems are created. However, the integration of MEMS into <b>smart</b> <b>labels</b> causes special requirements concerning power consumption and packaging. The power consumption {{of the system is}} limited due to the autonomous energy supply and so energy efficiency of the sensor is a key requirement. The special demands to the packaging are caused by the assembly of <b>smart</b> <b>labels.</b> The devices are integrated by flip chip bonding on an interposer, which is laminated between the capping layers of the label. Furthermore, usual roll to roll fabrication demands flexibility of the layers. This assembly technique limits the height of the components and hence, no additional housing of the chips is applicable. Therefore, wafer level packaging of the MEMS transducer providing hermetic sealing by minimizing chip geometry is necessary. For realizing a semi-active <b>smart</b> RFID <b>label</b> monitoring temperature, mechanical shock and inclination during transport processes, a MEMS based capacitive inertial sensor has been developed. For low energy consumption of the system sensor functionalities have been integrated and a low-power mixed-signal ASIC for sensor signal processing has been developed. Hermetic sealing of the microstructures has been done by seal glass bonding and a wafer level thin film encapsulation (TFE) technology based on CF-polymer as sacrificial layer material...|$|R
