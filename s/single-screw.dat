25|$|Despite {{her efforts}} the 930-ton <b>single-screw</b> Murtaja was not deemed {{powerful}} {{enough to keep the}} southernmost port of Finland open every winter, and the winter navigation committee appointed by the Senate came to a conclusion that a second icebreaker would be needed. The new icebreaker, equipped with propellers in both bow and stern, was built in 1898 and given the name Sampo.|$|E
25|$|Western Spirit {{was laid}} {{down as the}} steel-hulled, <b>single-screw</b> {{commercial}} cargo ship SS Western Spirit by the Northwest Steel Company in Portland, Oregon, under a United States Shipping Board contract. She was launched on 6 May 1918 and completed in mid-July 1918. The Shipping Board transferred her to the U.S. Navy on 19 July 1918 for use during World War I. The Navy assigned her the naval registry identification number 3164 and commissioned her at Portland on 30 July 1918 as USS Western Spirit (ID-3164) {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Commander Howard H. Rees, USNRF.|$|E
25|$|The harsh {{operating}} {{conditions of the}} arctic seas place high requirements on the strength, reliability and redundancy of the hull and propulsion machinery, especially for <b>single-screw</b> ships operating independently without icebreaker escort. For this reason the hull form of the SA-15 class freighters resembles that of icebreakers and their robust propulsion system has several innovative features and prototype arrangements to improve the ships' operational capability. Special attention has also been paid on the ships' general purpose characteristics by designing the cargo storage and handling facilities to allow various different types of cargo.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{building}} Sampo, Finland {{had only one}} state-owned icebreaker, Murtaja, which was built in 1890 {{and was one of}} the first purpose-built icebreakers in the world. However, the 930-ton <b>single-screw</b> vessel was not powerful enough to keep even the southernmost port of Finland, Hanko, open during severe winters and the icebreaking characteristics of its spoon-shaped bow were not as good as was hoped for. A committee, appointed by the Senate of Finland in 1895 to find a solution to the problem, came to a conclusion that a second state-owned icebreaker would be needed.|$|E
25|$|SS Western Star {{was laid}} {{down as a}} steel-hulled, <b>single-screw</b> Design 1013 {{commercial}} cargo ship by J. F. Duthie and Company in Seattle, Washington, under a United States Shipping Board contract for the French Compagnie Générale. She was launched on 4 July 1918 and completed late in August 1918. Upon her completion, the Shipping Board transferred her immediately on 28 August 1918 to the U.S. Navy for use during World War I. The Navy assigned her the naval registry identification number 4210 and commissioned her at Seattle on 28 August 1918 as USS Western Star (ID-4210) {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Commander Richard E.

25|$|Sause Bros. {{opened a}} shipyard, Southern Oregon Marine (SOMAR), in 1979, east of Coos Bay, Oregon. The SOMAR {{division}} of Sause Bros. constructs, modifies, repairs, and maintains the company's fleet of tugs and barges, including line-haul and ship-assist tugs, lumber barges, covered house barges, and double hull liquid cargo barges. During the mid-'70s, Sause Bros. had two <b>single-screw</b> 104ft (32m) tugs, the Joseph Sause and the Henry Sause, built in Louisiana. Over the years, SOMAR has lengthened these two tugs, increased the beam, and added new engines and twin screws {{to gain more}} working deck space fore and aft. These changes also made possible a larger pilot house, located {{near the center of}} the boat.|$|E
500|$|Feth-i Bülend (Ottoman Turkish: [...] "Great Victory") was an Ottoman ironclad warship {{built in}} the late 1860s, the lead ship of her class. The Ottoman Navy ordered her from the British Thames Iron Works, and she was laid down in 1868, {{launched}} in 1869, and commissioned in 1870.

500|$|Fredericton {{was built}} with a {{water-tube}} boiler. Ships built from 1939–1940 used a Scotch marine boiler. The revised design used a water-tube boiler {{that had not}} been available earlier. These boilers subsequently became standard in future ships as they were smaller, safer and easier to maintain than the Scotch marine, and produced a more reliable supply of steam. Fredericton was [...] long, which was about [...] longer than earlier designs. This allowed for a longer forecastle that added more living space and dry quarters. She was [...] wide and she had a draught of [...] forward and [...] aft. She was driven by a <b>single-screw,</b> triple-expansion reciprocating engine of , which gave her a top speed of [...]|$|E
500|$|HMS Minotaur was {{the lead}} ship of the [...] {{armoured}} frigates built for the Royal Navy during the 1860s. They were the longest <b>single-screw</b> warships ever built. Minotaur took nearly four years between her launching and commissioning because she was used for evaluations of her armament and different sailing rigs. The ship spent the bulk of her active career as flagship of the Channel Squadron, including during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee Fleet Review in 1887. She became a training ship in 1893 and was then hulked in 1905 when she {{became part of the}} training school at Harwich. Minotaur was renamed several times before being sold for scrap in 1922 and broken up the following year.|$|E
500|$|At about 9 p.m. on 6 May, {{during a}} fierce storm, the men aboard heard two [...] "explosive reports" [...] {{as the main}} hawsers parted from the anchors. The {{combined}} forces {{of the wind and}} the rapidly moving ice had torn Aurora from its berth and, encased in a large ice floe, the ship was adrift in the Sound. Stenhouse ordered that steam be raised in the hopes that, under engine power, Aurora might be able to work back to the shore when the gale abated, but the engines had been partly dismantled for winter repairs, and could not be started immediately. In any event the [...] engine and <b>single-screw</b> propeller lacked the required power. Slowly, the ship drifted further from the shore; the noise of the storm meant that the scientific party ashore at Cape Evans hut heard nothing; it would be morning before they found the ship had gone.|$|E
500|$|Mukaddeme-i Hayir (Ottoman Turkish: Great Abundance) was {{the second}} of two s built for the Ottoman Navy in the 1860s. The Ottoman Navy ordered her from the Imperial Arsenal in Constantinople, and she was laid down in 1870, {{launched}} in 1872, and commissioned in 1874. She was armed with four [...] guns, was powered by a <b>single-screw</b> compound steam engine with {{a top speed of}} [...] The ship saw action during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, but was [...] from 1878 to 1897. At the start of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, the Ottoman Navy mobilized Mukaddeme-I Hayir {{and the rest of the}} ironclad fleet but found almost all of the ships to be in unusable condition. Mukaddeme-i Hayir was disarmed the following year and converted into a stationary training ship in 1911. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, she became a barracks ship, and served in this capacity until 1923, when she was broken up.|$|E

2500|$|Comus was a <b>single-screw</b> {{corvette}} (later {{classified as}} a third-class cruiser) designed for distant cruising service for the British Empire. Built with iron frames and steel plating, she was sheathed with wood and coppered. [...] The hull was unprotected except for a 1.5 in (38mm) of armour over the machinery spaces. with some additional protection offered by the coal bunkers flanking the engine spaces and magazines.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} visit of Bryderen, the Senate sent a call for bids for several Finnish and foreign shipyards for the {{construction}} of a steam-powered icebreaker capable of breaking a [...] channel. Bids for a <b>single-screw</b> [...] "European-type" [...] icebreaker similar to the German icebreaker Eisbrecher I were received from German shipbuilder AG Vulcan Stettin, Danish Burmeister & Wain and Swedish shipyards Kockums AB and Bergsunds Mekaniska Verkstads AB. An expert committee appointed by the Senate recommended the second Swedish design, which was the second cheapest at 445,000 Swedish kronor, and the contract was signed with Bergsundet on 25 May 1889.|$|E
2500|$|The Nimbin is {{a vessel}} of [...] with {{a length of}} , a width of , and a depth of [...] She has a total cargo space of 60,900 cubic feet, and is fitted for the {{carrying}} of refrigerated cargo. She ¡s a <b>single-screw</b> vessel, propelled by a Burmeister and Wain 6-cylinder 4-cycle Diesel marine engine, with two auxiliary engines for maintaining the electric light and refrigerating services, and for working the winches and other gear. At her speed trials she developed 12.1 knots. A feature of the vessel is the accommodation for the crew, who have, for Instance, a bathroom fitted with hot and cold showers, in fresh and salt water. The three lifeboats are fitted with patent disengaging gear, which it is claimed, can be set afloat by unskilled hands {{in the space of}} half a minute.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was built}} as a <b>single-screw</b> steam-powered topsail {{schooner}} by Oregon Iron Works at Albina (Portland) Oregon in 1876 [...] and commissioned at San Francisco in 1877. She was constructed of fir and [...] "fastened with copper, galvanized iron, and locust tree nails". [...] Her appearance was typical of revenue cutters of the period, flush-decked (or nearly so) with clipper bow, fantail stern, two sail-bearing masts, pilot house and funnel amidships and a deckhouse (probably including the upper parts of the engine and boiler rooms) beneath and extending behind the pilot house. The boiler powering the propulsion machinery was of the Scotch marine boiler type {{and was the first}} instance of that type of boiler on a Revenue Cutter Service vessel. The addition of steam jackets on the cylinders to reduce condensation losses was another innovation new to the service. [...] Her cost and displacement were somewhat greater than the Dexter-class (1874) cutters of similar length and overall design.|$|E
2500|$|The Elbe had a 3-cylinder {{compound}} engine which provided power to her <b>single-screw</b> propeller. She was a fast ship for her time, {{being able to}} reach the speed of 15 knots, but small cargo capacity, along with her high consumption of coal, would soon make her uneconomical. She had a straight bow, two funnels and four masts. She was launched on 2 April 1881, {{the first of a}} series of eleven express steamers known as the [...] "Rivers Class", as they were all named after German rivers. After sea trials she made her maiden voyage on 26 June 1881, leaving Bremen for New York City via Southampton. The Elbe had accommodation for 179 First Class passengers, 142 in Second Class, and 796 in Steerage. She was a very popular ship with immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe to the United States and was virtually always sold out in steerage. The Elbe spent most of the next ten years working the North Atlantic service, but she also made three voyages to Adelaide in Australia, two of which were in December 1889 and 1890.|$|E
2500|$|The harsh {{operating}} {{conditions of the}} arctic seas placed high requirements on the strength, reliability and redundancy of the propulsion machinery, especially for <b>single-screw</b> ships operating independently without icebreaker escort. For this reason the robust propulsion system had several innovative features and prototype arrangements to improve the ship's operational capability. Propulsion power was provided by two 14-cylinder Wärtsilä-Sulzer 14ZV40/48 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines running on heavy fuel oil, each with a maximum continuous output of [...] at 560 rpm. As a precaution against failure of the propeller pitch control mechanism the main engines were directly reversible. The main engines were connected to a single propeller shaft through a double input/single output single-stage reduction gear equipped with separate multi disc clutches and Voith fluid couplings. The hydrodynamic couplings that allowed over 100% slipping between {{input and output shafts}} were used in difficult ice conditions to increase propeller torque and protect the main engines from large torque variations resulting from propeller blades hitting the ice. The fully locking mechanical clutches were used to improve fuel efficiency when the ship was operating in open water or light ice conditions. Because the power output per shaft of the SA-15 class freighters was at that time one of the highest among icebreaking ships, second only to the Arktika class nuclear icebreakers, the propeller of the ship was of extremely robust design. The four-bladed stainless steel controllable-pitch propeller was developed and manufactured by KaMeWa specially for the SA-15 project.|$|E
60|$|I {{sent you}} a short letter from Liverpool, saying {{that by the}} {{unprecedented}} delays of the Urania, which I had taken {{because it was the}} swiftest boat of the Neptune line, we had failed to pass the old, ten-day, <b>single-screw</b> Galaxy liner which Aristides had sailed in. I had only time for a word to you; but a million words could not have told the agonies I suffered, and when I overtook him on board the Orient Pacific steamer at Plymouth, where she touched, I could just scribble off the cable sent Mr. Makely before our steamer put off again. I am afraid you did not find my cable very expressive, but I was glad that I did not try to say more, for if I had tried I should simply have gibbered, at a shilling a gibber. I expected to make amends by a whole volume of letters, and I did post a dozen under one cover from Colombo. If they never reached you I am very sorry, for now it is impossible to take up the threads of that time and weave them into any sort of connected pattern. You will have to let me off with saying that Aristides was everything that I believed he would be and was never really afraid he might not be. From the moment we caught sight of each other at Plymouth, he at the rail of the steamer and I {{on the deck of the}} tender, we were as completely one as we are now. I never could tell how I got aboard to him; whether he came down and brought me, or whether I was simply rapt through the air to his side. It would have been embarrassing if we had not treated the situation frankly; but such odd things happen among the English going out to their different colonies that our marriage, by a missionary returning to his station, was not even a nine days' wonder with our fellow-passengers.|$|E
