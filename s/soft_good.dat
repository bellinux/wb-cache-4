He married Louise Nielo, {{the daughter of a}} wealthy well known business family. Together they started their business, known as Tjin-Kon-Fat - Nielo & Co. After a fire in 1899 destroyed their business on Waterkant,he,and especially his wife,lost everything. Fortunately,they could start over again,using the Nielo family store on Saramaccastraat. In later years he left his wife and her family in bankruptcy. He predominantly was a plantation owner taking charge of at least three plantations in Oldenburg, Nieuw Meerzorg, and Monsort. His plantations grew assortments of rice, vegetables, coffee and coco. In the town of Oldenburg, his own rice/peeling factories/mills processed the raw materials into retail goods in which he sold in the supermarkets that he owned throughout the towns of Oldenburg, Nieuw Meerzorg, Waterkant, Poeloepantje, and Paramaribo.

40|$|This project {{centered}} on inventory optimization for operative custom surgical packs and <b>soft</b> <b>good</b> supplies for Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), a 947 -bed medical center. Custom surgical packs {{are used in}} every surgical case and delivered to the hospital by a vendor who manufactures them off site. These large packs contain unwrapped surgical items (drapes, gown, sutures, etc.) delivered to each operating room {{prior to the start}} of surgery. Once a surgical pack is opened, the items inside are consumed or wasted. MGH uses the custom packs to reduce the amount of time warehouse associates spend picking individual items and to reduce preparation time in the operating rooms prior to the patient arriving. To augment the custom packs, individually packaged and sterilized items (called soft goods) are requested by the surgeon for each case. Specific case information, surgeon's preferences for materials, and patient needs dictate these <b>soft</b> <b>good</b> supply requirements. Soft goods are ordered from separate vendors and together with the custom packs comprise a surgeon's preference card. The hospital orders custom packs and soft goods with the intent to keep three days of supply on hand or to fill shelf space, whichever is greater. This situation triggers bloated and redundant inventory stores throughout MGH. Despite the sub-optimality of this policy, no analysis had informed hospital leadership of the correct levels of inventory or the best ways to cover preference cards. To solve these challenges, we formalized an optimization model that minimized the purchasing and holding costs of custom packs and soft goods while satisfying the supply requirements of all preference cards. As an input, the model used all current pack configurations and new pack configurations born from the overlaps of current surgical packs. Base stock reductions are achievable through covering "sibling" procedures with the new combined pack configurations and picking displaced items as soft goods. The model results revealed a modular pack structure as the most cost effective method to cover all preference cards. The new modular pack structure prescribed replacing 14 of the 65 current packs with 16 smaller packs to reduce overall value of inventory on hand. Currently, we estimate that this work will save the hospital in excess of $ 1. 3 M annually by reducing inventory on the shelf and lowering associated holding costs through risk pooling. by Matthew R.

40|$|The MAX {{phase is}} a group of layered ternary compounds, which has {{combined}} properties of metals and ceramics. Like metals they are ductile, readily machinable, relatively <b>soft,</b> <b>good</b> thermal and electrical conductive and has good damage tolerance. Li ke ceramics they have good high temperature strength, high elastic modulus and good oxidation and corrosion resistance. Cr 2 AlC {{is one of the most}} promising candidate in the MAX phase group. Due to its unique combination of properties, it has potential appl ications for diverse field of applications, especially as high temperature materials and protective coatings, etc. Since last two decades, a lot of research has been carried out on synthesis, sintering and property evolution, but commercial exploitation of these materials is still limited. Recent reports on MAX phases revealed the importance of powder production and development of sintering methods. Producing Cr 2 AlC powders with high purity, has been a major challenge; whereas reaction kinetics and thermody namics have been rarely explored. Moreover, understanding the sintering mechanism in multi - element system is difficult, whereas identification of a particular element which would be controlling the sintering is still a major challenge. The present investig ation has been initiated with three major objectives: i) to synthesize the high purity ultrafine Cr 2 AlC powders through mechanically activated synthesis route, ii) to study the reaction kinetics and thermodynamic aspects of Cr 2 AlC formation, and iii) to de termine the sintering mechanisms of Cr 2 AlC powders. Powder synthesis was done in three stages: firstly, CrC x (x = 0. 5) powder was prepared from Cr and C (graphite) at 1100 ºC. CrC x powder consists mainly two types of carbides, Cr 7 C 3 and Cr 3 C 2 phases in eq uimolar ratio, as represented by a chemical reaction: 10 Cr + 5 C  Cr 7 C 3 + Cr 3 C 2. Secondly, these synthesized CrC x powders were milled for 15 and 30 h using high energy planetary ball mill, with the aim of particle size refining and increasing the chemical reactivity of the powder. Finally, these mechanically activated carbide powders were reacted with pure Al powders at various temperatures. The formation reaction can be represented as: Cr 7 C 3 + Cr 3 C 2 + 5 Al  5 Cr 2 AlC. Milling energies (during milling of chro mium carbide powders) were estimated for 15 h and 30 h duration as 1. 6 kJ/g and 3. 2 kJ/g respectively. Effect of mechanical activation (i. e., milling durations) of chromium carbide powders on the reaction with pure Al powder was clearly noticed. Nearly pur e Cr 2 AlC powders with xii submicron particles (below 400 nm) were produced at 800  C, using 15 h milled carbides. Little excess amount (about 0. 4 mol) of Al was required to achieve very high purity Cr 2 AlC phase. DSC technique was employed to assess the thermod ynamic factors for Cr 2 AlC formation. Cr 2 AlC formation reaction was exothermic in nature, which occurred as soon as aluminium started melting. Changes in enthalpy of reaction was found from - 53 kJ/mol (for 15 h milled) to - 66 kJ/mol (for 30 h milled). The G ibb’s free energy of reaction was found to become more negative with increasing milling time; it changed from - 107 kJ/mol to - 139 kJ/mol, when milling was increased from 15 h to 30 h. This has enabled the conversion at relatively lower temperature of about 700 °C. Reaction kinetics was analysed through the activation energies of 366 - 369 kJ/mol and 315 - 316 kJ/mol for Cr 2 AlC formation from 15 h and 30 h milled carbides respectively. The Cr 2 AlC powder produced at 800 ºC using 15 h milled reactants, was subjec ted to further sintering studies. Green compacts (of about 61...|$|E
