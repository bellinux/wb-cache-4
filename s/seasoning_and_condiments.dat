40|$|The {{study was}} purposed to {{determine}} the consumer acceptance of common carp (Lepotobarbus hoevenii Blkr) atom crackers that added with fish meat compared to that added with fish meal. The fish meal was obtained from traditional markets. The fish initially was processed into fish meal and mixed with tapioca flour, water, <b>seasoning</b> <b>and</b> <b>condiments</b> and then fried. The quality of fish crackers produced was assessed for their consumer acceptance and their chemical composition. The fish cracker added with the fish meat showed the highest consumer acceptance {{at the rate of}} 100 %. The fish cracker added with the fish meat contained 6, 10 % moisture, 29, 46 % protein, 7, 00 % fat and 2, 17 % ash...|$|E
40|$|<b>Seasonings</b> <b>and</b> <b>condiments</b> can be {{candidate}} {{vehicles for}} micronutrient fortification if consumed consistently and if dietary practices ensure bioavailability of the nutrient. In this review, we identify {{factors that may}} affect the bioavailability of iron, vitamin A, zinc, and folic acid when added to <b>seasonings</b> <b>and</b> <b>condiments</b> <b>and</b> evaluate their effects on micronutrient status. We {{take into consideration the}} chemical and physical properties of different forms of the micronutrients, the influence of the physical and chemical properties of foods and meals to which fortified <b>seasonings</b> <b>and</b> <b>condiments</b> are typically added, and interactions between micronutrients and the physiological and nutritional status of the target population. Bioavailable fortificants of iron have been developed for use in dry or fluid vehicles. For example, sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (NaFeEDTA) and ferrous sulfate with citric acid are options for iron fortification of fish and soy sauce. Furthermore, NaFeEDTA, microencapsulated ferrous fumarate, and micronized elemental iron are potential fortificants in curry powder and salt. Dry forms of retinyl acetate or palmitate are bioavailable fortificants of vitamin A in dry candidate vehicles, but there are no published studies of these fortificants in fluid vehicles. Studies of zinc and folic acid bioavailability in <b>seasonings</b> <b>and</b> <b>condiments</b> are also lacking...|$|R

5000|$|A 1991 {{report by}} the European Community's (EC) Scientific Committee for Foods reaffirmed monosodium glutamate's safety and {{classified}} its [...] "acceptable daily intake" [...] as [...] "not specified", the most favorable designation for a food ingredient. In addition, the EC Committee said, [...] "Infants, including prematures, {{have been shown to}} metabolize glutamate as efficiently as adults and therefore do not display any special susceptibility to elevated oral intakes of glutamate." [...] Legislation in effect since June 2013 classifies glutamic acid and glutamates as salt substitutes <b>and</b> <b>seasonings</b> <b>and</b> <b>condiments</b> with a maximum level of consumption of 10g/kg expressed as glutamic acid.|$|R
40|$|Umami {{is one of}} {{the basic}} taste {{produced}} by monosodium glutamate (MSG). Generally, commercial MSG products did not specify the amount of a certain dose to produce palatable food. This problem could lead to uncontrolled and excessive use of MSG by consumers. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the values for the detection and preference threshold of umami taste from commercial MSG products at different salt level. The detection threshold was determined using R-index method in salt solutions. The preference threshold was determined by using hedonic rating in food model. A food model selected in this case is spinach soup that is commonly consumed by Indonesian. The salt concentrations for detection and preference threshold experiment were 0. 42 and 0. 30 g/ 100 mL. Umami taste preference threshold value using Fechner’s psychophysic equation for 0. 30 g/ 100 mL salt concentration is 0. 25 g MSG/ 100 mL, while for 0. 42 g/ 100 mL salt concentration, the umami taste preference threshold value is 0. 06 g MSG/ 100 mL. Detection threshold value using R-index method for 0. 30 g/ 100 mL salt concentration is 0. 05 g MSG/ 100 mL, while for 0. 42 g/ 100 mL salt concentration is 0. 02 g MSG/ 100 mL. Different salt concentrations leads to differences in the values of threshold preferences and detection threshold of the umami taste of MSG. Increasing salt concentration tends to decrease the detection and preference threshold of umami taste from MSG. This research results could be used as the basic information in food product formulation such as <b>seasoning</b> <b>and</b> <b>condiment</b> using mixtures of salt and MSG...|$|R

This paper underscores equity considerations for the implementation of large-scale fortification of <b>condiments</b> <b>and</b> <b>seasonings</b> as a public health strategy by examining nonexhaustive examples of programmatic experiences and pilot projects in various settings. An overview of conceptual elements in implementation research and equity is presented, followed by an examination of equity considerations for five implementation strategies: (1) enhancing the capabilities of the public sector, (2) improving the performance of implementing agencies, (3) strengthening the capabilities and performance of frontline workers, (3) empowering communities and individuals, and (4) supporting multiple stakeholders engaged in improving health. Finally, specific considerations related to intersectoral action are considered. Large-scale fortification of <b>condiments</b> <b>and</b> <b>seasonings</b> cannot be a standalone strategy and needs to be implemented with concurrent and coordinated public health strategies, which should be informed by a health equity lens...|$|R
