40|$|We {{identify}} two likely normal faults on Europa, of lengths z 30 and 11 km. A simple ßexural {{model of}} fault-related topography gives effective elastic thicknesses of 1. 2 and 0. 15 km, respectively, {{and the resulting}} inferred fault strength is of order 1 MPa. The maximum fault displacement: length ratio for each fault is z 0. 02, comparable with values on silicate planets. We combine this observation with a modiÞed linear elastic fracture mechanics model {{to conclude that the}} shear modulus of the Europan surface must be signiÞcantly less than that for unfractured ice. The low value of the modulus is probably due to near-surface fracturing or porosity, which will affect the materialÕs radar properties and seismic velocities. For a likely reduction in shear modulus of an order of magnitude, the driving stresses inferred are about 6 e 8 MPa, much higher than present-day diurnal tidal stresses. However, stresses approaching these values can be generated by non-synchronous rotation or polar wander, while stresses exceeding these values arise during ice <b>shell</b> <b>freezing.</b> If the entire larger fault breaks, it will generate an event of seismic magnitude Msz 5. 3...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{two different}} works. The first part introduces a thermal multimeter which measures heat capacity, thermal conductivity and density. The instrument gives continuous measurement data within a temperature range. With some exceptions this also holds for {{the prototype of}} a thermal multimeter which is built and tested. The measuring method is constant heating of {{one side of a}} slab. The slab is insulated on all other sides. After some time there will be equilibrium where there is a constant temperature difference over the slab. The thermal conductivity can be calculated from this temperature difference. The heat capacity can be calculated from how fast the temperature rises. Measurements of the slab thickness give density as function of temperature. The second part discusses a practical method for measuring the heat transfer coefficient (α). The method is based on <b>shell</b> <b>freezing</b> of clear jelly which has the same shape as the product of interest. Transparent jelly is transparent before it freezes and white when frozen. If the sample is removed from the freezer and cut through before it is completely frozen thefreezing front is distinct and the thickness of the frozen layer can be measured. By measuring time the jelly sample was in the freezer and thicknessof the frozen layer the heat transfer coefficient can be calculated by using Plank's equation. The method is suitable for measuring local α because it can be shown that tangential heat flow can be neglected when the frozen layer is thin. Computer simulations, automated data acquisition and data processing are a considerable part of this thesis, even though it is not obvious from the results presented. There are more lines in the data code written to obtain the results presented here then the number of lines in this thesis. The size of selected simulation results and processed data from the measurements are 6. 3 GB. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{superchilling}} {{process is}} defined as a method of preserving food by partial ice-crystallization. The product quality of superchilled food is very promising, and has nearly the same sensorial attributes and nutritional value as the original product. However, more research is required to make the technology more suitable to the preservation of food. The optimal degree of superchilling and information {{on the development of the}} ice crystals during the superchilling process and storage are needed because of their large influence on the quality of the final superchilled food. The main objective of this thesis was modelling and studying of ice crystallization/recrystallization of food during the superchilling process and storage. In order to fulfil the objective the following research activities have been carried out: A one-dimensional model for predicting partial freezing time necessary to achieve an optimal degree of superchilling in foods was developed. The degree of superchilling is the amount of free water frozen (5 - 30 %) inside the food and is among the most important parameters which influence the quality of superchilled product. The study of the ice crystallization/recrystallization of food in superchilling technology was studied based on the superchilling rate, and the state of food muscle. The relationship between the development of ice crystals in salmon and quality parameters during the superchilled storage was also studied. The final research activity in this thesis was to study differences in the superchilling storage methods, <b>shell</b> <b>freezing</b> and non- <b>shell</b> <b>freezing.</b> The developed model was sufficient to study the thermal behaviour of food, and had the advantage that it was simple, very fast and detailed enough to estimate the superchilling time and behaviour of food. The model was validated experimentally using salmon, and there was good agreement between the numerical and experimental results. Further study to quantify the model using other food products is recommended. The characteristics of ice crystals have a large influence on the quality of the final superchilled food. At a high superchilling rate (227 W/m 2. K, - 30 ℃ and 2. 1 min), smaller and well distributed ice crystals within and outside the cell were formed compared to a slow superchilling rate (153 W/m 2. K, - 20 ℃ and 4. 2 min), where larger and extra-cellular ice crystals were formed. The state of muscle also has an influence on the characteristics of ice crystals. In pre-rigor muscle, the ice crystals were formed inside the cells regardless of the superchilling rate. However, at a slow superchilling rate the ice crystal size was larger than at a high superchilling rate. The formation of the ice crystals inside the cells, regardless of the superchilling rates, is the most important factor for reducing the damage of food muscles and hence maintaining the quality. New information was discovered in this work on the development of ice crystals during the superchilling process and storage of salmon. There was a significant increase in ice crystal size between the superchilling process (day 0) and superchilled storage (after 1 day of storage). The ice crystals formed in the surface layer were 4 times larger after only 1 day of storage than those formed at day 0. Prior to temperature equalisation, ice crystals growth progressed from the surface to the centre of the superchilled food. Different layers with different sizes of ice crystals within the superchilled salmon were also observed. This was due to thermal behaviour within the superchilled sample, and because we have both ice at the surface and water at the centre, the diffusion process should occur. The recrystallization at this time (between day 0 and 1) is unavoidable however, after temperature equalization (after 1 day of storage) and control of temperature during storage there was no significant growth of ice crystals for the entire storage time. The development of ice crystals in red salmon muscle was also studied during the superchilling process and storage. The size of the ice crystals formed in the red salmon muscle was smaller than those formed in the white salmon muscle. In addition, the ice crystals formed in the pre-rigor red muscle was smaller than that formed in the post-rigor red salmon muscle. These findings are significant for the industry because small ice crystals indicate better quality. Quality changes have been studied with a focus on physical measurements, water holding capacity (WHC) and drip loss. The disappearance of liquid water is a major factor affecting the protein changes during superchilled storage. It was observed that the drip loss was lower in superchilled salmon compared to conventional chilled salmon, and frozen salmon between 1 and 14 days of storage. No significant differences were found in WHC and drip loss between 1 and 14 days of storage in superchilled salmon. The two superchilling storage methods showed differences in the development of ice crystals within the superchilled salmon. In non-shell frozen samples, the ice crystals were mainly formed in the extracellular spaces. Fine and well distributed ice crystals were formed in both the intracellular and extracellular spaces in shell frozen samples. Generally, the results found in this study have given more information in the superchilling area. The developed model which can be scaled-up to the industrial level, together with information on the development of the ice crystals, which has a large influence on the quality of the final superchilled food are useful for the industry in estimating the refrigeration requirements for a superchilling system and designing the necessary equipment. In addition, the quality study revealed that the superchilling is practicable if the product is partially freezing fast, with an optimal degree of superchilling (5 - 30 %), good packaging and a strict control of the temperature during superchilled storage.

50|$|Most {{materials}} shrink as they solidify, but, as {{the adjacent}} table shows, a few materials do not, such as gray cast iron. For the materials that do shrink upon solidification {{the type of}} shrinkage depends on how wide the freezing range is for the material. For materials with a narrow freezing range, less than 50 C, a cavity, known as a pipe, forms {{in the center of}} the casting, because the outer <b>shell</b> <b>freezes</b> first and progressively solidifies to the center. Pure and eutectic metals usually have narrow solidification ranges. These materials tend to form a skin in open air molds, therefore they are known as skin forming alloys. For materials with a wide freezing range, greater than 110 C, much more of the casting occupies the mushy or slushy zone (the temperature range between the solidus and the liquidus), which leads to small pockets of liquid trapped throughout and ultimately porosity. These castings tend to have poor ductility, toughness, and fatigue resistance. Moreover, for these types of materials to be fluid-tight a secondary operation is required to impregnate the casting with a lower melting point metal or resin.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Bread {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{consumed}} foods in the world, and alternatives have been sought to extend its <b>shell</b> life, and <b>freezing</b> {{is one of the}} most popular methods. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of freezing rate and trehalose concentration on the fermentative and viscoelastic properties of dough and bread quality. Dough was prepared and trehalose was added at three concentrations (0, 400, 800 ppm); dough was pre fermented and frozen at two freezing rates then stored for 42 days. Frozen dough samples were thawed every two weeks. CO 2 production and elastic and viscous modulus were determined. In addition, bread was elaborated and specific volume and firmness were evaluated. High trehalose concentrations (400 and 800 ppm) produced dough with the best viscoelastic and fermentative properties. Greater bread volume and less firmness were observed when a slow freezing rate (-. 14 °C/min) was employed...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a core/shell bi-layered calcium {{phosphate}} cement (CPC) -based composite scaffold with adjustable compressive strength, which mimicked {{the structure of}} natural cortical/cancellous bone, was fabricated. The dense tubular CPC shell was prepared by isostatic pressing CPC powder with a specially designed mould. A porous CPC core with unidirectional lamellar pore structure was fabricated inside the cavity of dense tubular CPC <b>shell</b> by unidirectional <b>freeze</b> casting, followed by infiltration of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and immobilization of collagen. The compressive strength of bi-layered CPC-based composite scaffold can be controlled by varying thickness ratio of dense layer to porous layer. Compared to the scaffold without dense shell, the pore interconnection of bi-layered scaffold was not obviously compromised because of its high unidirectional interconnectivity but poor three dimensional interconnectivity. The in vitro {{results showed that the}} rat bone marrow stromal cells attached and proliferated well on the bi-layered CPC-based composite scaffold.

A portion of the innner layer, where daily growth lines are observed under a microscope, was cut out vertically from the inner surface. A stick measuring 20 x 1 x 2 mm was then placed in water and frozen. Using a microtome, 50 um interval samples were pealed off the stick in a room maintained at - 20 ℃. We determined {{the date of the}} formation of each sample by measuring the distance from the inner surface of the shell and by counting the daily growth lines. The water temperatures estimated from the oxygen isotopic values at 1 - 2 day intervals agreed very well (correlation coefficient: 0. 90) with the observed water temperatures which have a seasonal temperature range between about 20 ℃ and 32 ℃. This implies that the Tridacna precipitates its shell in isotopic equilibrium with the surrounding sea water and that the oxygen isotope values are mainly determined by the water temperature...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFrom an ontogenetic {{point of}} view, {{invertebrate}} eggs are generally the most freezing intolerant {{stage of a}} species. Development state, water content and acclimation may affect their supercooling ability. In this study, we measured fresh mass, water content and temperature of crystallisation (Tc) of eggs of the edible land snail Cantareus aspersus, depending on its form (‘‘aspersa'' vs. ‘‘maxima''), incubation temperature (20, 12 and 7 C) and physiological age (as part of the complete development). We also tested their tolerance to freezing. Despite {{a high number of}} individual observations (n = 759) and significant differences of fresh mass and water content between both subspecies, no effect of origin, incubation temperature or development state has been found in this study. Tc remained constant whatever the condition, with an overall mean of 5. 40 ± 0. 24 C (mean ± SD). We suggest that fresh mass is important, a high water content and a constantly wet surface confer to land snail eggs a poor ability to supercool. Moreover, the presence of ice nucleating agents at the egg surface (microorganisms present in the soil, calcium carbonate crystals of the egg <b>shell)</b> might induce <b>freezing.</b> Thus, considering the present results, to delay hatching by cryopreservation of eggs does not seem possible...|$|R
40|$|Turnip {{yellow mosaic}} virus (TYMV) {{is a small}} {{isometric}} plant virus which decapsidates by releasing its RNA {{through a hole in}} the capsid, leaving behind an empty shell [R. E. F. Matthews and J. Witz, (1985) Virology 144, 318 - 327]. Similar empty shells (artificial top component, ATC) can be obtained by submitting the virions to various treatments in vitro. We have used differential scanning calorimetry, analytical sedimentation, and electron microscopy to investigate the thermodenaturation of natural empty shells (NTC, natural top component) present in purified virus suspensions, and of several types of ATCs. ATCs divided in two major classes. Those obtained by alkaline titration, by the action of urea or butanol behaved as NTC: their thermograms contained only one peak corresponding to the irreversible dissociation of the shells and the denaturation of the coat protein. The temperature of this unique transition varied significantly with pH, from 71 degrees C at pH 4. 5 to 84 degrees C at pH 8. 5. The thermograms of ATCs obtained by freezing and thawing, or by the action of high pressure, contained two peaks: shells dissociated first into smaller protein aggregates at 57 degrees C (at pH 5. 0) to 61 degrees C (at pH 8. 5), which denatured at the temperature of the unique transition of NTC. Shells obtained by heating virions to 55 degrees C at pH 7. 6, changed conformation after the release of the viral RNA, as upon continuous heating to 95 degrees C, their thermograms were similar to those of the <b>shells</b> obtained by <b>freezing</b> and thawing, whereas after purification they behaved like NTC. Structural implications of these observations are discussed...|$|R
