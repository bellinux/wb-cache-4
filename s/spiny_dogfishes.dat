50|$|The Squalidae, {{also called}} dogfish sharks or <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfishes,</b> are {{a family of}} sharks in the order Squaliformes. They have two dorsal fins, each with smooth spines, but no anal fin, and their skin is {{generally}} rough to the touch.

40|$|From 1978 to 1988, {{approximately}} 71, 000 <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> (Squalus acanthias) were tagged off {{the west}} coast of Canada.

As of December 2000, 2940 tagged fish (4. 1 %) have been recaptured. <b>Spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> were tagged in three major areas: Strait of Georgia, west coast Vancouver Island, and northern British Columbia waters. Generally, <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> were recaptured close to their release site; however, extensive migrations (up to 7000 km) did occur.

40|$|Abstract. —Large {{numbers of}} <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> Squalus acanthias {{moved into the}} area {{near the mouth of}} the Big Qualicum River, British Columbia, at the time hatchery-reared smolts of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and coho salmon O. kisutch were leaving the river in 1988 and 1989. A small {{percentage}} of the <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> preyed on the smolts, but the resulting smolt mortality {{is believed to have been}} large because of the large numbers of <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> in this area. <b>Spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> also fed on adult salmon in the fall. The long-term decline in survival of chinook salmon produced at the Big Qualicum Hatchery was similar to the pattern of survival of other hatchery-produced salmon. We propose that this long-term decline in survival results from predation. <b>Spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> Squalus acanthias are abundant in the Strait of Georgia. The biomass of the pop-ulation is about 60, 000 tonnes (Fargo and Tyler 1989), representing 35 million <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> (based on an average weight of 1. 7 kg).

40|$|The <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish,</b> Squalus acanthias, is a {{small shark}} found in {{temperate}} waters worldwide, where it is or has been important in commercial fisheries. It is exceptionally slow-growing and long-lived and therefore especially prone to rapid over-exploitation and long-lasting depletion. The sustainability of <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish</b> fisheries is further hampered by the tendency for directed fisheries to target large, mature females. Reproductive biomass in the Northwest has declined by 75 % in the past 15 years and total biomass has fallen by 95 % in the Northeast Atlantic since fisheries began over one hundred years ago. Demand for <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish</b> meat, primarily from Europe where depleted stocks may no longer meet market demand, is driving targeted fisheries around the world, none of which are effectively managed. <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish</b> fins also enter international trade for use in shark fin soup. There are no regional or international management measures in place for <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish.</b> Biology The <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish</b> is a temperate, cosmopolitan species with principal populations found in the North Atlantic, the eastern South Pacific, the South Atlantic off South America, the Cape coast of South Africa, the southern coasts of Australia and New Zealand, and the North Pacific. Although they are highly migratory, little mixing occurs among populations. <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish</b> travel in large schools, segregated by size and sex. They are found from the intertidal zone to depths of 900 m. Usually coastal and demersal, they migrate north and south as well as nearshore and offshore in 7 – 15 o C water (Compagno 1984). <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish</b> are very long-lived. Individuals in the Pacific are thought to grow more slowly and larger {{than those in the}} Atlantic (Nammack et al. 1985). Life history characteristics are summarized below. Smith et al. (1998) found <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish</b> to have the lowest intrinsic rebound potential of 26 shark species analyzed.

40|$|Dorsal fins have diverse morphologies across shark species. However, {{little is}} known about the ability of sharks to control fin {{movements}} and the nature of the balance of forces during swimming. White-spotted bamboo sharks, Chiloscyllium plagiosum, and <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish,</b> Squalus acanthias, are two unrelated species that inhabit different habitats and have strikingly different dorsal fin morphologies. Previous studies that have used a shark model in a wind tunnel have hypothesized that median fins function in stabilization during steady swimming. ^ The dorsal fin anatomy of benthic white-spotted bamboo sharks and benthopelagic <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> reflects their different swimming habits. White-spotted bamboo sharks live in complex reef habitats and thus have requirements for high maneuverability. <b>Spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> occupy a variety of coastal and continental shelf habitats and are known to form schools, spending more time in open water environments. Principal component analysis separates these two species in morphospace. Bamboo sharks are characterized by a second dorsal with larger area and proportionally more muscle inserting onto first and second dorsal fins in comparison to <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish.</b> The two species also differ in the morphology of the skeletal support of the dorsal fin. Basals and radials in <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> are almost indistinguishable, while radials in bamboo sharks are more numerous and are arranged in two rows of elongate, plate-like elements that articulate with one another. The muscle of the dorsal fin in <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> is composed of one large muscle mass that extends to all of the proximal radials in <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish,</b> while in bamboo sharks distinct individual muscle bundles insert onto the ceratotrichia overlying the distal and proximal skeletal elements. ^ During steady swimming, the first dorsal fin in <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> move independently of the body with larger amplitudes at lower speeds, indicating a stabilizing function. The dorsal fins in bamboo sharks move in synchrony with the trunk, with a larger range of motion than dogfish at both speeds. The first and second dorsal fins of bamboo sharks move laterally in phase with the axial portion of the body, although with larger lateral displacement. ^ Electromyography data shows simultaneous muscle activity on both sides of the first dorsal fin in <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> which is independent of speed, indicating active stiffening of this fin. The second dorsal fin in <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> and both dorsal fins in bamboos show alternating muscle activity on each side of the fin, indicating active flapping. Flow acceleration and vortex shedding were identified at the wake of the second dorsal fin in <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> and both dorsal fins in bamboo sharks using particle image velocimetry. Flow in the wake of the second dorsal was considerably decelerated. These data demonstrate that contrary to the traditional hypothesis, not all dorsal fins function as stabilizers; the first dorsal fin in <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> contributes to stability while the second dorsal fin, as well as both dorsal fins in bamboo sharks, contribute to thrust production. ^ During maneuvers, the dorsal fin muscles are active on both sides in <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> and white-spotted bamboo sharks. <b>Spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> have longer burst duration on the contralateral side, consistent with opposing resistance to the medium. In bamboo sharks, activation might be insufficient to counteract water resistance. The function of the dorsal fins is more flexible and diverse than first thought and might explain the morphological diversity in dorsal fins found among sharks. ...|$|R

We briefly explore the energetic ramifications of ctenophores in the <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> diet, inferring that the presence of gelatinous zooplankton represents an ambient feeding strategy. Relative to other prey, ctenophores are not a high energy density prey item. However, given varying assumptions of the amount of ctenophores consumed, they may be an important staple in the diet of <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish.</b> We also examine the utility of using <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> as a gelatinous zooplankton sampling device.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 This study {{examines}} the {{spatial and temporal}} distribution and life history of the "offshore" component of the Northeastern Pacific <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> (Squalus acanthias) population. Distribution was examined in relation to latitude, depth, the Columbia River plume and large-scale climate changes. Fishery and survey data indicate that the Northeastern Pacific <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> population has a broad range along the Washington and Oregon coasts, with the highest abundance occurring off the northern Washington and central Oregon coasts. Catches, however, were patchy throughout the 37 -year period of available survey data. In terms of depth, the greatest abundances of <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> were captured in shallow waters (55 - 184 m). An examination {{of the influence of}} the Columbia River plume using a generalized additive model (GAM) indicated that the fish were influenced significantly by the salinity, chlorophyll and surface temperature patterns associated with the plume, preferring the oceanic zone to the plume zone. In contrast, there was no indication that the catch-per-unit-effort of <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> was influenced by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) or the El-Niño (ENSO) over 24 -year period of the National Marine Fisheries (NMFS) triennial shelf groundfish survey (1977 - 2001). The multi-cohort age structure of the population, due to the <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish's</b> late age at maturity and long lifespan, as well as the low fecundity make it difficult to detect the loss of a single cohort or two when examining abundance trends. Moreover, effects on abundance may be time-lagged, especially if, as is likely, the youngest cohort(s) is the most vulnerable life stage. Their absence would not become evident until they were large enough to have been captured by the survey gear. Sensitive abundance data and/or age-structured data would be needed to identify a pattern.

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to increase understanding of migration and movement behaviors associated with a highly migratory elasmobranch species. In particular, I seek to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to warrant {{the separation of the}} northwest Atlantic <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish</b> (Squalus acanthias) into separate management units. These management units are not genetically distinct, but rather would be based on unique behaviors adopted by hypothesized groups of dogfish that connect reproductive, feeding, and overwintering grounds (“contingents”). This dissertation includes an introductory chapter that introduces the reader to the <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish</b> resource and recent management actions undertaken, followed by a chapter that provides technical and design recommendations based on a meta-analysis and a case study, which address the challenges of conducting behavioral research in dynamic environments through the use of acoustic telemtry. Approximately 30 percent of papers reviewed had no details on design specifications. Meta-analyses suggest that more fish were redetected when more acoustic equipment was deployed for longer periods of time, exemplifying the need for robust equipment that can withstand the rigors of an offshore, dynamic environment. In particular, we found that a heavy anchor, a subsurface float holding a mooring line, and a highflier-float system produced the best results in our case study. New behavioral information, derived from an analysis of data collected through a long-term conventional mark-recapture program and a multi-year acoustic tagging program, suggest that <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> tagged off North Carolina in overwintering grounds routinely make seasonal migrations to summer feeding habitats off southern New England (specifically, Massachusetts), but do not necessarily follow the same pathway each year. Sharks were often not detected on acoustic receivers for lengthy periods of time, and mark-recapture data indicated extremely lengthy times at liberty (1, 000 + days). <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish</b> were also noted to be locally abundant but exhibit short residency times on the Hatteras Bight acoustic array. An evaluation of potential environmental drivers of localized behavior in the southern extent of the <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish</b> range noted that certain factors (i. e., water temperature and weather) had an effect on the presence and absence of dogfish in the Hatteras Bight. Finally, the dissertation discusses the <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish</b> Contingent Hypothesis, which suggests that the northwestern Atlantic stock could comprise as many as five behaviorally distinct groups of <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish.</b> The work presented in this dissertation identifies predictable behavioral patterns undertaken by individual <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish</b> and inferred from recapture data, which can be used in context with future studies to further evaluate and refine the <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish</b> Contingent Hypothesis. Despite many examples in the literature where Contingent Theory has been applied to describe spatially complex behavior in fish stocks, it is rarely applied in management plans. The current management structure in place for <b>Spiny</b> <b>Dogfish</b> is complex, has evolved to respond to fishery needs over the past 16 years, and involves multiple state and federal agencies, councils and commissions. Future research would likely need to quantify contingent “vital rates” and/or contribution to overall spawning stock biomass or fisheries to fully justify {{the development of a new}} management framework...|$|R

Gillnets are widely used for fishing operations and assessments. This project was undertaken to determine the feasibility and estimate parameters for using gillnets to estimate abundances. The goals of this study were to determine the percentage of <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> vertically distributed above the fishing height of the NEFSC calibrated trawl survey and determine the catchability of <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> in a gillnet. The catchability of <b>spiny</b> <b>dogfish</b> in a gillnet was determined by multi-pass depletion sampling inside a corral net. The maximum efficiency was 8. 6 % with a 95 % confidence interval of 5. 8 % to 11. 3 % during a 10 minute soak time. The minimum catch efficiency was 1. 6 % with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 9 % to 2. 2 %. Recalculated population estimates from a previous study using gillnets produced estimates between 3. 87 x 10 ⁶ and 9. 09 x 10 ⁶ metric tons of mature females, depending on the method of estimating catch efficiency used for coastal North Carolina waters. Catch efficiency was not affected by dogfish being tagged; tagged dogfish are captured at the same rate as untagged. A vertically elongated gillnet was used to estimate that the NEFSC is missing a minimum of 21. 8 % (SD = 25. 1 %, Variance = 6. 3) of the dogfish vertically suspended in the water column depending on water depth.
