Although slightly altered by manufacturer Lotto (the 1998 jersey was a white jersey with the chequers on the right <b>side,</b> <b>like</b> a flying flag) and Nike since its original release, the chequered motif was adopted {{as a symbol of}} national identity and similar designs are used by all Croatian national sports teams.|$|E

The album was released on CD on 7 April 1988.|$|E
5|$|Glenn was {{a backup}} pilot for Shepard and Grissom {{on the first}} two manned Project Mercury flights, Mercury-Redstone 3 and Mercury-Redstone 4 sub-orbital missions. Glenn was {{selected}} for Mercury-Atlas 6, NASA's first manned orbital flight, with Carpenter as his backup. Putting a man in orbit would achieve one of Project Mercury's most important goals. Shepard and Grissom had named their spacecraft Freedom 7 and Liberty Bell 7. The numeral 7 had originally been the production number of Shepard's spacecraft, but had come to represent the Mercury 7. Glenn named his spacecraft, number 13, Friendship 7, and had the name hand-painted on the <b>side</b> <b>like</b> the one on his F-86 had been. Glenn and Carpenter completed their training for the mission in January 1962, but postponement of the launch allowed them to continue rehearsing. Glenn spent 25 hours and 25 minutes in the spacecraft performing hanger and altitude test, and 59 hours and 45 minutes in the simulator. He flew 70 simulated missions and reacted to 189 simulated system failures.|$|E

25|$|Antler beam diameter, not {{the number}} of tines, {{indicates}} age. In North America moose (A. a. americanus) antlers are usually larger than those of Eurasian moose and have two lobes on each <b>side,</b> <b>like</b> a butterfly. Eurasian moose antlers resemble a seashell, with a single lobe on each side. In the North Siberian moose (A. a. bedfordiae), the posterior division of the main fork divides into three tines, with no distinct flattening. In the common moose (A. a. alces) this branch usually expands into a broad palmation, with one large tine at the base {{and a number of}} smaller snags on the free border. There is, however, a Scandinavian breed of the common moose in which the antlers are simpler and recall those of the East Siberian animals. The palmation appears to be more marked in North American moose than in the typical Scandinavian moose.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of the Great Raid, many trade goods were en route from {{overseas}} to New Orleans, Louisiana to San Antonio, Texas and Austin, Texas; a total inventory valued at over $300,000 was reported to be at Linnville at that moment, including an undisclosed amount of silver bullion. Linn noted that in addition to the cloth and other trade goods usually present in his warehouse at that time were several cases of hats and umbrellas belonging to James Robinson, a San Antonio merchant. [...] "These the Indians made free with, and went dashing about the blazing village, amid their screeching squaws and `little Injuns,' like demons in a drunken saturnalia, with Robinson's hats on their heads and Robinson's umbrellas bobbing about on every <b>side</b> <b>like</b> tipsy young balloons."

However, in Fates the triangle differs from previous installments, with swords and magic defeating axes and bows, axes and bows besting lances and hidden weapons, and lances and hidden weapons overpowering swords and magic. Weapons in Fates do not have a limited number of uses before they break; instead, stronger weapons will lower some of the user's abilities. For instance, while the Brave Sword allows its user to attack twice, it also lowers their defense and magic defense stats.|$|E
500|$|Castroneves {{was upset}} about the penalty and leapt from his car and yelled in anger at the flagman (looking for an explanation) and grabbed the Head of Security Charles Burns as he sought an answer. He argued {{that he did not}} change his line: [...] "I {{actually}} gave him room outside. When you go side by <b>side</b> <b>like</b> that with your teammate and the guy [...] has just swept ... literally, literally just takes it away from you ... it's just absurd." [...] Castroneves was fined $60,000 by the IRL for unsportsmanlike conduct and was placed on probation {{for the rest of the}} season. It was later revealed by IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard that the series considered suspending Castroneves but chose not to because of his popularity with its fanbase. Castroneves later apologized for his actions but still did not agree with the penalty. Comparisons were made between Castroneves' block and the Brazilian's manoeuvre against Wilson in the 2008 Detroit Indy Grand Prix. Gordon Kirby of Motor Sport Magazine opined that Castroneves' move was fair and sportmanslike and noted that several fans saw it as [...] "good, hard racing".|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Masterpiece", Madonna sings {{about the}} pain of being {{in love with someone}} who is a great work of art, with the lyrics {{including}} [...] "If you were the Mona Lisa, You'd be hanging in the Louvre, Everyone would come to see you, You'd be impossible to move." [...] Madonna said the song describes Wallis Simpson and is [...] "about a woman who has fallen in love with this untouchable thing, this man that was raised to be king. One of the lines of the song 'it must be so hard to always be the chosen one.' At {{the end of the day}} nothing is indestructible, no matter how high you might rise in the world you are still a human being." [...] Marc Schneider from Billboard described [...] "Masterpiece" [...] as a slowed-down, moody ballad that showcases strong execution of vocals from Madonna. He described the production as [...] "simple, direct and reminiscent of her sound in the 1990s". The lyrics were described as emotional, and was comparable to the film's love story, with the chorus as follows: [...] "And I'm right by your <b>side,</b> <b>Like</b> a thief in the night, I stand in front of a masterpiece. And I can't tell you why it hurts so much to be in love with a masterpiece. 'Cause after all, nothing's indestructible".|$|E

500|$|On 2 September, Benfica played Nacional at the Estádio da Choupana. They scored {{their first}} {{goal in the}} 17th minute, adding two more {{in the second half}} for their first league win. A delighted Camacho said, [...] "I liked the second half a lot. We were much better altogether." [...] After a two-week {{international}} break, Benfica resumed competition against Naval on the 15th. Cristian Rodríguez scored the opener in the 22nd minute, followed by Rui Costa a few minutes later. In the second half, Nuno Gomes scored the third and final goal. Although Camacho was pleased with the win, he was concerned about his team's early performance. Three days later, Benfica visited the San Siro to play Milan. Their opening game in the group stage did not go as planned; they conceded an early goal by Andrea Pirlo, who scored again with an assist by Filippo Inzaghi. Nuno Gomes scored in the 92nd minute of the 2–1 loss. Camacho was philosophical: [...] "You pay for every mistake you make against a <b>side</b> <b>like</b> Milan. I don't blame our lack of experience because we were facing the best team in Europe." [...] On 23 September, Benfica played Braga at the Municipal de Braga; both teams failed to convert several goal opportunities for a scoreless draw. Camacho was unconcerned with the result, since the league race had many matches remaining. Benfica played Estrela da Amadora at the Estádio da Reboleira in the third round of the new League Cup the following Wednesday, winning on penalty kicks and advancing to the next round. September ended with the Derby de Lisboa against Sporting CP. For the second time in a week, Benfica could not break their opponent's defence, conceding their fourth draw of the season. Camacho attributed the result to wasted opportunities: [...] "We only failed in scoring. We had many shots; many were good, but football is like this." ...|$|E
500|$|While Johnny Depp was Burton's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Ichabod Crane, Paramount {{required}} him to consider Brad Pitt, Liam Neeson and Daniel Day-Lewis. Depp was cast in July 1998 for his third collaboration with Burton. The actor wanted Ichabod to parallel Irving's description of the character in the short story. This included a long prosthetic snipe nose, huge ears, and elongated fingers. Paramount turned down his suggestions, and after Depp read Tom Stoppard's rewrite of the script, he was inspired to take the character even further. [...] "I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine <b>side,</b> <b>like</b> a frightened little girl," [...] Depp explained. He did not wish to portray the character as a typical action star would have, and instead took inspiration by Angela Lansbury's performance in Death on the Nile. [...] "It's good," [...] Burton reasoned, [...] "because I'm not the greatest action director in the world, and he's not the greatest action star." [...] Depp modeled Ichabod's detective personality from Basil Rathbone in the 1939 Sherlock Holmes film series. He also studied Roddy McDowall's acting for additional influence. Burton added that [...] "the idea was to try to find an elegance in action of the kind that Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing or Vincent Price had." [...] Christina Ricci, who worked with producer Scott Rudin on The Addams Family, was cast as Katrina Van Tassel. Sleepy Hollow also reunited Burton with Jeffrey Jones (from Beetlejuice and Ed Wood) as Reverend Steenwyck, Christopher Walken (Max Schreck in Batman Returns) as the Hessian Horseman, Martin Landau (Ed Wood) in a cameo role, and Hammer veteran Michael Gough (Alfred in Burton's Batman films), whom Burton tempted out of retirement. The Hammer influence was further confirmed by the casting of Christopher Lee in a small role as the Burgomaster who sends Crane to Sleepy Hollow.|$|E

2500|$|Depp's next {{venture with}} Burton was the period film Sleepy Hollow (1999), {{in which he}} played Ichabod Crane {{opposite}} Christina Ricci and Christopher Walken.

2500|$|A large eel was {{an early}} suggestion. Eels are found in Loch Ness, and an unusually-large one would explain many sightings.
