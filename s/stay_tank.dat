25|$|Steel diving {{cylinders}} are preferred over aluminium cylinders by some divers—particularly {{cold water}} divers who must wear a suit that increases their overall buoyancy—because of their negative buoyancy. Most steel <b>tanks</b> <b>stay</b> negatively buoyant even when empty, aluminium tanks may become positively buoyant as the gas they contain is used. High-pressure (300bar) steel tanks are significantly negative.|$|R

Gasoline cars can be retrofitted to LPG aka Autogas and become bifuel vehicles as the gasoline <b>tank</b> <b>stays.</b> You can switch between LPG and gasoline during operation. Estimated 10 million vehicles running worldwide.|$|R

Israel's Elbit, which {{developed}} the helmet-mounted display {{system for the}} F-35, plans Iron Vision to use a number of externally mounted cameras to project the 360° view of a tank's surroundings onto the helmet-mounted visors of its crew members. This allows the crew members to <b>stay</b> inside the <b>tank,</b> without having to open the hatches to see outside.|$|R
5000|$|The Red Army Mechanized {{infantry}} tactics {{during the}} 1950s {{were similar to}} World War II methods in which APCs were used as [...] "battle taxis"; they would keep the infantry {{in close proximity to}} the battle-tanks during movement, but on enemy contact they would unload their infantry before retreating to safer areas. This was in contrast to the German doctrine of infantry fighting vehicles manifested in the Schützenpanzer Lang HS.30, where the vehicles were supposed to <b>stay</b> with the <b>tanks</b> and engage lighter targets, both to take a burden off the tanks and to support their infantry squads.|$|R
2500|$|The band's first CD {{release was}} on Tank Records, a record label created by Carvalho and Teves. The CD was a split release with the bands Moronique and Merrick, {{entitled}} [...] after {{the number of}} tracks each band contributed. Soon after, the band released its debut album, The Way to a Girl's Heart Is Through Her Boyfriend's Stomach. The band considers this their first [...] "real" [...] release, as all the songs had been written after Angelini joined the band. In retrospect, they consider it their most cheerful record. It was reissued the following year on All About Records, but the band <b>stayed</b> with <b>Tank</b> Records to release its second album, Benefits Of Thinking Out Loud. During the album's recording, the band members had a strained relationship as they argued over its production. Six outtakes from the album's recording sessions were compiled onto an EP entitled The Champagne of Bands... We Know Sexy released by Fork in Hand Records. Following its release, Carvalho left the band. Christopher Levesque quickly replaced him.|$|R
2500|$|The {{division}} was formed on 2 August 1942 from the 1st Airborne Corps in Lyubertsy, near Moscow. Its most famous action was {{the defense of}} the Stalingrad Tractor Factory during the Battle of Stalingrad. The {{division was}} highly decorated, receiving two Orders of the Red Banner, the Order of Suvorov 1st class, the Order of Kutuzov 1st class and the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky. It became the 27th Guards Mechanised Division in [...] December 1945 and on 20 April 1957 the 39th Guards Tank Division at Polotsk (Borovukha), Vitebsk Oblast, Belarussian Military District. On 1 January 1965 it became the 37th Guards <b>Tank</b> Division, <b>staying</b> within 7th <b>Tank</b> Army for the duration. In 1992 it became part of the Belarus Ground Forces. The tank division was converted to the 37th Separate Guards Mechanized Brigade, which was disbanded in fall 2011. The division's lineage currently exists as the 37th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base of the North Western Operational Command at Polotsk.|$|R

5|$|When the glider was {{carrying}} tanks or other vehicles, common practice was that their engines would be {{started in the}} air, usually {{just prior to the}} glider casting off from the tug; special exhaust ducts were fitted to the glider to expel exhaust fumes. The Tetrarch and M22 Locust light tanks were so large that they barely fit inside the glider, and as such their crews <b>stayed</b> inside the <b>tank</b> {{for the duration of the}} flight. Once the glider landed, the anchorages keeping the vehicle stationary would be released by the driver pulling a lanyard within his reach, and the driver would then drive the tank forward, which automatically pulled a line that operated the swing door release. Universal Carriers and other vehicles relied on one of the pilots operating the door line manually. This was achieved by the pilot sliding down the fuselage and then dropping to the ground. They would then go to each undercarriage leg and release the valves there, which would expel hydraulic fluid and allow the shock absorbers struts to deflate, and then enter the glider and operate the door release line. If the swing door was jammed after the glider had landed, it was possible for tanks to break through the unopened forward fuselage and drive straight out of the glider, which occurred in both airborne operations where Hamilcars transported tanks.|$|R
5000|$|The scene {{goes back}} to the present, the official, looking {{sympathetic}} and moved by what he is hearing, listens as Capelli sadly says Alpha Team later guessed that Murphy, who knew if the team performed Leavitt's plan no one would have made it home, so he did the only thing he could think of - Murphy decided to sacrifice himself to make sure the Chimera didn't get the bomb, and the team got home. Murphy must have used a syringe to give Oppenheimer a transfusion of his own blood, which for a normal human would be like taking a hit of pure adrenalin. It would kill him within 10 minutes, but Murphy possibly figured he wasn't going to survive much longer anyway, and he needed him awake. Because the ship was only 5,000 feet off the ground, and Murphy knew as long as the <b>tank</b> <b>stayed</b> in one piece, the team, possessing Sentinel regenerative powers, was only rendered unconscious after they crashed onto the snowy ground. Oppenheimer, however, died in the fall. 20 or 30 minutes later, Alpha Team regained consciousness and saw [...] "it" [...] from about 50 miles away - the bomb detonating and completely destroying the ship in a fiery explosion, with Murphy still aboard. Alpha Team was picked up 17 hours later by a submarine that SRPA had sent to investigate the blast. Capelli finishes by stating, truly touched and lost for words, his belief Murphy was a hero and, if SRPA hadn't erased all their names from the record, Capelli would be recommending him for the Medal of Honor.|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of minute {{amounts of water}} in any fuel-based system is important. Its presence in a large underground tank might {{be a sign of}} a leak where fuel is flowing into the water table and causing an environmental problem. A simple and effective means of real time monitoring of small concentrations of dissolved water in fuel tanks is therefore needed. Due to their polar molecular structure both water and many hydrocarbons readily absorb 2 GHz microwave radiation. This singular phenomena can be used to detect water concentrations in hydrocarbon solutions by modulating the microwave field and detecting the thermal effect by means of a modification of the photoacoustic cell method [1], Although hydrocarbons, as well as water, possess microwave absorption properties, the overall effect when thermal properties are taken into account allows for the {{detection of}} water. The emitted acoustic signal amplitude is dependent on thermal properties of the fluid. These properties are a function of relative concentrations of the components in a two fluid system. A relation between component concentration and acoustic emission amplitude can be found and this phenomena can be used in detection of one of the components. In the system presented here the fluid is applied to a stripline microwave transmission line and forms the high loss dielectric in the transmission line. The emitted acoustic signal is monitored with an attached polyvinyldedrafluoride (PVDF) microphone {{in the form of a}} PVDF foil fastened to the detector cell. This detector can be be made submersible and can <b>stay</b> in the <b>tank</b> for continuous monitoring. Essentially, our system is a single frequency microwave spectroscopy based detector which is tuned to the amplitude modulation frequency of the microwave excitation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConvenient, economical, {{and reduced}} labor fish harvest and {{transfer}} systems {{are required to}} realize operating cost savings {{that can be achieved}} with the use of much larger and deeper circular culture tanks. To achieve these goals, we developed a new technology for transferring fish based on their avoidance behavior to elevated concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO 2). We observed this behavioral response during controlled, replicated experiments that showed dissolved CO 2 concentrations of 60 – 120 mg/L induced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to swim out of their 11 m 3 “growout” tank, through a transfer pipe carrying a flow with ≤ 23 mg/L dissolved CO 2, into a second 11 m 3 “harvest” tank. The research was conducted using separate groups of rainbow trout held at commercially relevant densities (40 – 60 kg/m 3). The average weight of fish ranged from 0. 15 to 1. 3 kg during the various trials. In all trials that used a constant flow of low CO 2 water (≤ 23 mg/L) entering the growout tank from the harvest tank, approximately 80 – 90 % of the fish swam from the growout tank, through the transfer pipe, and into the harvest tank after the CO 2 concentration in the growout tank had exceeded 60 mg/L. The fish that remained in the growout <b>tank</b> <b>stayed</b> within the area of relatively low CO 2 water at the entrance of the transfer pipe. However, the rate of fish transfer from the growout tank to the harvest tank was more than doubled when the diameter of the transfer pipe was increased from 203 to 406 mm. To consistently achieve fish transfer efficiencies of 99 %, water flow rate through the fish transfer pipe had to be reduced to 10 – 20 % of the original flow just before the conclusion of each trial. Reducing the flow of relatively low CO 2 water near the end of each fish transfer event, restricted the zone of relatively low CO 2 water about the entrance of the fish transfer pipe, and provided the stimulus for all but a few remaining fish to swim out of the growout tank. Results indicate that the CO 2 avoidance technique can provide a convenient, efficient, more economical, and reduced labor approach for fish transfer, especially in applications using large and well mixed circular culture tanks...|$|R
50|$|A {{few weeks}} later, John returns home and Skye moves back in. John learns Skye is dating Tank Snelgrove (Reece Milne), {{the boy who}} kidnapped Evelyn and punched Josh. John orders Skye to <b>stay</b> away from <b>Tank</b> and tells Tank's father, Greg Snelgrove (Paul Gleeson) to keep his son away from Skye. John finds a letter from Skye saying that she has left the Bay with Tank. A week later, Skye returns home to collect {{the rest of her}} stuff and John begs her to stay, but Skye declines, saying she wants to be with Tank. When Alf suffers a heart attack and a stroke, Marilyn returns him to support him. John tells Marilyn that he wants to foster another child and they foster Jordan Walsh (Benny Turland). John {{initially}} tries too hard to befriend Jordan, but he later offers him a job at the juice bar and they bond. John and Marilyn's house is burgled by Jordan's father. He apologises and Jordan decides to give him a second chance, so they leave for the city. After Hunter King (Scott Lee) fails his Bronze Medallion test, he smashes John's radio. John unintentionally sets fire to Hunter's caravan and soon apologises when Hunter gets the blame. John collapses outside the Surf Club and is hospitalised. Soon, John starts committing arson around the Bay. He sets the bush alight during the Summer Grooves music festival, and the smoke contributes to Billie Ashford's (Tessa de Josselin) early death. Kat works out John is behind the arson attacks. John collapses and is told that he has a brain tumour. He undergoes surgery and learns that he is the Bay's arsonist. He receives abuse from the community and is fired from his job, until Alf steps in and gets it back for him. VJ Patterson (Matt Little), decides to forgive John despite his actions but it does little to make John change his mind. Martin Ashford (George Mason), pushes John against a pylon and badly injures him, having to be restrained by Patrick Stanwood (Luke McKenzie), and causing John to undergo a checkup at the hospital. After having a talk with Patrick, Ash eventually forgives John. Although Marilyn assures him that their lives are back on track, John still decides to leave the bay. John then attends his trial and despite having Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) to represent him, John is found guilty and given jail time. John is sent to prison for arson and Billie's death. During visiting hours, a fellow inmate sexually harasses Marilyn, and John starts a fight in retaliation.|$|R
