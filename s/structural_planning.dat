The City of Melbourne&# 039;s draft municipal strategic statement identified &# 039;&# 039;City North" as a great urban renewal area that can accommodate {{a significant part of}} the growth. Structure plans provide guidance to the community, planners, business, government and developers about the appropriate directions and opportunities for future changes in City North. Proposing street hierarchy, increasing the building heights, expanding the urban forest by increasing tree canopy coverage, implementing green roofs and overall transition from a low-rise to medium rise urban area are some of the strategies presented in <b>structural</b> <b>plans.</b> This study investigates the effect of future <b>structural</b> <b>plans</b> presented in &# 039;&# 039;Plan Melbourne" on pedestrian thermal comfort in City North for extreme hot summer days. A three-dimensional microclimatic modelling tool ENVI-met 3. 1 was used to evaluate the outdoor human thermal environment for the existing and future scenarios proposed by the Victorian government. Field measurements were carried out to validate ENVI-met and examine its ability in addressing the research objectives. <b>Structural</b> <b>plans</b> were modelled t in three stages; increased building height, adding tree canopy coverage and adding green roofs. The study showed that deeper canyons, higher aspect ratios and lower sky view factors in future scenario contribute to lower level of mean radiant temperatures (42 C- 64 C), compared to the existing scenario (49 C- 60 C).

A key aspect {{of this study was}} the crafting of overlapping series of points of imitation. Until quite recently, analytical enquiries into how Palestrina’s textures are structured generally did not go much beyond features of melody, mode and the supposed unpre-dictability of his imitative points. 1 However, over {{the last decade or so}} a number of studies have probed the ways in which Renaissance composers used imitation and invertible counterpoint as tools for <b>structural</b> <b>planning.</b> My present study draws upon the particular contributions of John Milsom on the topic of fuga and Peter Schubert on modular analysis.

Building is made from reinforced concrete with constant height of 4 meters. Building model receives earthquake load in the form of response spectrum of earthquake area with high ground accelaration (g). Earthquake area that is picked is at Banda Aceh with two soil condition (moderate soil and softsoil). Structure performance is decided by using ATC- 40 code which is affected by target displacement.
