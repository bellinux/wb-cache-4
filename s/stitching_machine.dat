This has resulted in substantially increasing the efficiency of diesel locomotives. Suri-Transmission and its improvements are covered by 36 patents in 11 major countries.In the mid-sixties, the Green Revolution triggered large-scale tractor usage in India. To meet this growing demand in 1965, CMERI initiated a project for design and development of 35 HP tractor based on indigenous know how. The developed tractor technology has been named as Swaraj by Indira Gandhi (the then Prime Minister of India). Recently, the institute developed the Soleckshaw electric rickshaw under the CSIR-800 community project program, {{with the aim of}} reducing the carbon footprint of the city and simultaneously mitigating the drudgery of the manual rickshaw puller. The institute in collaboration of West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency (WBREDA), also developed a smart card based prepaid energy meter for use with renewal energy sources.

40|$|The {{problem of}} failure {{diagnosis}} {{has received a}} considerable attention {{in the domain of}} reliability engineering, process control and computer science. The increasing stringent requirement of quality of a product needs considerable attention in the performance and reliability of the manufacturing system. In general, the feedback control algorithm for a process designed to handle small perturbation that may arise under normal operating condition but can not accommodate any abnormal behavior due to fault. Thus the automated maintenance or early detection of worn equipment is becoming a critical issue. This justifies the need of development of effective methodology in the area of fault aware controller. In this paper we proposed a novel Algorithm and it have been tested and implemented for making Highly reliable system like Automated Cricket Ball <b>Stitching</b> <b>Machine.</b> Considering this need the present paper proposes the work on the development methodology of fault aware controller using embedded processor with reference to an early needle failure detection of a leather <b>stitching</b> <b>machine.</b> ...|$|E
