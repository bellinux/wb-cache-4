40|$|Introduction: Most of {{the upper}} airway {{obstructions}} are caused by adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Prevalence of nocturnal enuresis in children accompanied with upper airway obstruction is reported in 8 - 47 % of cases. Considering this fact that adenotonsillar hypertrophy is curable by adenotonsilletomy, in present study {{the effect of this}} operation in treatment of children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy has been investigated by comparing the rate of nocturnal enuresis pre and post operation. Materials and Methods: During a period of 18 months, all children referred to otorhinolaryngology department of Ghaem hospital suffering from nocturnal enuresis and adenotonsillar hypertrophy have been surveyed. The patients were evaluated for improvement in nocturnal enuresis after adenotosillectomy for a period of three months. Results: Theaverage age of patients was 6. 8 years. 63. 8 % of children had primary nocturnal enuresis and 36. 2 % <b>secondary</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis.</b> One month after adenotonsillectomy in 88 % of children nocturnal enuresis was completely cured.

40|$|Purpose We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} pelvic floor muscle training on the efficacy of full spectrum therapy and maximal voided volume in children with nocturnal enuresis. We also determined factors predicting treatment outcome, full spectrum therapy duration and the relapse rate. Full spectrum therapy {{is a combination of}} alarm, reward, timed voiding and drinking, over learning and pelvic floor muscle training. Materials and Methods A total of 63 consecutive children were referred to the physiotherapy department for full spectrum therapy to resolve nocturnal enuresis, including 32 in the experimental group who underwent full spectrum therapy with pelvic floor muscle training and 31 in the control group who underwent full spectrum therapy without training. Results There {{was no significant difference in}} treatment outcome, duration, maximal voided volume and relapse between the 2 groups. Of all children 89 % became dry within 6 months. During the year after treatment 33. 3 % and 37. 9 % of the experimental and control groups relapsed, while the relapse rate at 1 year was 7. 4 % and 20. 7 %, respectively. Age and child motivation were associated with the duration of success (p = 0. 04 and < 0. 01, respectively). <b>Secondary</b> <b>enuresis</b> and psychosocial problems were factors significantly related to relapse (each p < 0. 01).

40|$|Background: Nocturnal {{enuresis}} (NE), is a distressing {{experience for}} children and young people, and successful treatment invariably improves their psychological functioning. Objectives: The overall objective was health promotion of school children, and the specific objectives were: to determine the frequency and risk factors of nocturnal enuresis (NE) among school children in Qaluobia governorate Egypt, and to examine its associations with behavioral and emotional problems. Subjects and methods: This study was a cross-sectional study that was conducted during the academic year 2011 / 2012 on 450 students aged 6 – 12  years in Qaluobia governorate. A brief questionnaire was distributed to screen the enuretic children (No. 70) who were invited and their parents, after their consent to fill a well-designed questionnaire. Results: Prevalence of NE was 15. 7 %, where primary NE was 67. 1 %, and the <b>secondary</b> <b>enuresis</b> was 32. 9 % with a non significant difference (p >  0. 05). There was a high significant difference among various treatment strategies with the highest applicable one was medications and the least applicable one was the usage of bed alarm {{as well as physical}} therapy means. There was a significant decrease in the frequency of NE by aging with the highest rate by the age of 6  years and the lowest by 12  years where it declined markedly. Positive family history was 30 % among the involved students. Conclusion: The prevalence of NE in Qaluobia governorate is slightly higher than some other areas of the world. The frequency of enuresis declines by aging process. The primary as well as the <b>secondary</b> <b>enuresis</b> is common among the selected age group.

40|$|PURPOSE: Compare parents' {{reports of}} youth {{problems}} (PRYP) with adolescent problems self-reports (APSR) pre/post behavioral treatment of nocturnal enuresis (NE) {{based on the}} use of a urine alarm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adolescents (N = 19) with mono-symptomatic (primary or <b>secondary)</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> group treatment for 40 weeks. Discharge criterion was established as 8 weeks with consecutive dry nights. PRYP and APSR were scored by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-Report (YSR). RESULTS: Pre-treatment data: 1) Higher number of clinical cases based on parent report than on self-report for Internalizing Problems (IP) (13 / 19 vs. 4 / 19), Externalizing Problems (EP) (7 / 19 vs. 5 / 19) and Total Problem (TP) (11 / 19 vs. 5 / 19); 2) Mean PRYP scores for IP (60. 8) and TP (61) were within the deviant range (T score &# 8805; 60); while mean PRYP scores for EP (57. 4) and mean APSR scores (IP = 52. 4, EP = 49. 5, TP = 52. 4) were within the normal range. Difference between PRYP' and APSR' scores was significant. Post treatment data: 1) Discharge for majority of the participants (16 / 19); 2) Reduction in the number of clinical cases on parental evaluation: 9 / 19 adolescents remained within clinical range for IP, 2 / 19 for EP, and 7 / 19 for TP. 3) All post-treatment mean scores were within the normal range; the difference between pre and post evaluation scores was significant for PRYP. CONCLUSIONS: The behavioral treatment based {{on the use of}} urine alarm is effective for adolescents with mono-symptomatic (primary and <b>secondary)</b> nocturnal <b>enuresis.</b> The study favors the hypothesis that enuresis is a cause, not a consequence, of other behavioral problems.

This article aims at presenting a review of the current information on nocturnal enuresis, including definition, causes and the available therapeutic modes, keeping the main focus on primary nocturnal enuresis. The possible mechanisms for primary nocturnal enuresis include-Genetic Factors, Maturational Delay, Sleep Disorders, Psychological Causes, and Small Bladder capacity. Treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis can be divided into two major categories: pharmacological and Non-pharmacological. There is no consensus about continuous medication. Children who have frequent episodes of enuresis should use a combination of a drug and an enuresis alarm. Relapse rate is very high with drug. After evaluating the cost, efficacy, side effects and the relapse rates associated with various treatments, Behavior Therapy, Parent awakening &the enuresis alarms seem to be most efficacious.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: We present here a {{long-term}} observation of 2 {{children with a}} rare syndrome with a non-neurogenic neurogenic bladder dysfunction (Hinman's syndrome), and we investigated the safety and efficacy of long-term use of terazosine in association with prophylactic antibiotics, timed voiding and a bowel regimen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two children, 7 years-old (22 kg) and 11 years-old (36 kg) presented in 1997 to our pediatric urology clinic with symptoms of urgency, frequency, urge incontinence and nocturnal enuresis. Both children were placed in a regimen of terazosine (starting with 0. 5 mg increasing until 2 mg). RESULTS: There were no significant side effects throughout the entire treatment. The first 7 -year old boy however developed some dizziness when the dose of terazosine was increased to 2 mg (after 4 weeks of administrating 1 mg), and this disappeared immediately when the dosage was reduced back to 1 mg daily. The urgency symptoms improved in both boys after 3 weeks of 1 mg terazosine. The <b>secondary</b> <b>enuresis</b> in the 11 year-old boy resolved after 2 months of 2 mg terazosine. CONCLUSION: It {{is possible to say}} that the alpha-blocker medication, terazosine can be administered safely to children with a non-neurogenic bladder dysfunction, also known as the Hinman's syndrome. These results have shown that dysfunctional voiding, postvoiding residual and upper tract involvement can disappear over time when long term terazosine is given in combination with timed voiding, prophylactic antibiotic therapy and treatment of the associated constipation.

In this study between teeth grinding and snoring, sleep apnea and snoring, open mouth breathing and snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep apnea, sleep duration and time of sleep of parents, there was significant relation (p-value< 0. 001). Conclusion: According to findings, mouth breathing was the most common sleep disorder in our subjects and had a significant relation with sleep snoring. So due to treating ability of nonmedical therapy in sleep disorders, it is recommended to increase parents information about necessity of medication and its effect on children cognition...|$|E
40|$|A {{community}} {{survey of}} enuresis {{was carried out}} in November/December 2002 among 300 apparently healthy children aged 5 - 16 years selected systematically from the Ehor Local Government Area in Edo State, Nigeria. This was done with the aim of ascertaining the true prevalence of the disease and the contributions of some organic causative factors. The overall prevalence of enuresis was 21. 3 &#x 0025;. Of the 64 children who were enuretic, 58 (91 &#x 0025;) had only nocturnal enuresis. No strict daytime enuresis was recorded. Combined daytime and night time enuresis accounted for only six (9. 4 &#x 0025;) cases. Ninety-four percent of cases of enuresis were primary, while only six were <b>secondary.</b> Prevalence of <b>enuresis</b> declined significantly with increasing age (X 2 = 14. 93, df = 3; p = 002). There was a strong association between enuresis and family history of bed wetting (more so with siblings) (X 2 = 45. 09, p < 0. 000). Though not statistically significant, enuresis was more common in males, in children drawn from families of poor socio-economic status, among first order births, and among those with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Also, there was no significant association between enuresis and hemoglobin genotype. Organic conditions played a minimal role in the etiology of enuresis in the study location, but the morbidity occurred frequently enough to warrant health attention. A community approach is advocated because only an insignificant proportion is seen in orthodox health facilities...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{the natural history}} of patients with nocturnal enuresis (NE) during a 10 -year period and to evaluate possible impact of comorbid conditions on the persistence of NE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-five children (male to female ratio [M:F] 65 : 30), aged at first visit between 6 and 21 years were included in this study. Of study subjects 75 had primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PMNE), 3 had <b>secondary</b> monosymptomatic nocturnal <b>enuresis</b> (SMNE) and 17 had non-mono­symptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NMNE). Demographic and NE-related details were assessed from electron­ic medical records and by telephone interview at the times 3, 6, 12 months and 3, 5, 10 years after the first examination. Sixty-seven of 95 patients were enrolled, of whom 57 had PMNE (M:F ratio 39 : 18, mean age 9. 35 ± 2. 81 years, mean age at improvement 11. 5 ± 4. 08 years), 8 had NMNE (M:F ratio 4 : 4, mean age 10. 1 ± 2. 64 years, mean age at improvement 12. 6 ± 1. 68 years) and 2 had SMNE (M:F ratio 1 : 1, mean age 12 years, mean age at improvement 13. 5 ± 2. 12 years). RESULTS: The mean duration of follow up was 7. 2 ± 2. 5 years. All of the 67 children had 5 years follow up. Only 29 of 67 patients (19 with PMNE, 8 with NMNE and 2 with SMNE) had 10 years follow up and 4 of 19 with PMNE were still affected by NE. Out of 57 patients with PMNE 12 (2 / 12 with language disorders, 1 / 12 varicocele and 1 / 12 cryptorchidism) and out of 8 patients with NMNE 1 were still enuretic while all patients with SMNE were in remission. CONCLUSION: We observed that language disorders and testicular pathology in NE children could be comor­bidities associated with persistence of NE and treatment resistance...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Enuresis {{involves}} involuntary emptying of {{the bladder}} at night, completely orpartially, from {{five years of}} age. If it occurs twice or more/week {{for at least three}} months and it causes suffering, the diagnosis is enuresis. Enuresis is divided into primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>enuresis.</b> In the past, enuresis was interpreted as a psychiatric symptom. Today, psychological disorders are seen as secondary to enuresis. Aim: The purpose of this literature study was to describe {{the quality of life of}} children and adolescents with enuresis. Method: A literature study was performed to compile the current state of knowledge regarding quality of life in connection with enuresis. Scientific articles for the study has been searched via PubMed and Cinahl. Results: The results were put together under four of WHO’s six themes, physical health/ psychological health/independence/ social relationships. These are linked to quality of life. As well as a fifth theme emerged from the analysis of the scientific articles, cultural aspects. Children and adolescents with enuresis experienced their life situation mainly as having poor self-esteem, after that it affected mental health, body image, independence, family and social interaction. Conclusion: This literaturestudy demonstrated that children and adolescents were influenced by the quality of life of their enuresis. Among other things, related to social relations, where the boys experienced a greater impact on the quality of life than the girls. In particular, adolescents experienced a worse quality oflife than the younger children, affecting self-esteem. In the clinical activity, it is necessary as apediatric nurse to take into account the experiences and feelings of children and adolescents regarding the daily life of enuresis, in order to achieve optimal enuresis treatment and thus increase their quality of life...|$|E
