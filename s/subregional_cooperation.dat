40|$|Although {{the overall}} {{economic}} performance of economies in South Asia {{in recent years}} has been impressive, there is concern that an aging and increasingly inadequate infrastructure may limit the potential for further growth and economic development. A critical infrastructure component is the transportation network, and there are currently several transportation infrastructure projects in the South Asia <b>Subregional</b> Economic <b>Cooperation</b> (SASEC) region, connecting Nepal, eastern India, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. This paper uses computable general equilibrium (CGE) methods to address how these infrastructure developments might affect the broader economy in SASEC, and in particular impact on income distribution and poverty. The paper describes a new CGE model for South Asia, covering India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan, which incorporates modifications to household structure in order to capture the implications of reform for changes in intra-household income.

40|$|Following a brief {{survey of}} the various {{economic}} cooperation programs and initiatives in which countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) - particularly Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV) - are engaged, this paper examines {{the extent to which}} GMS economies have coveraged and become integrated, among themselves but also with other ASEAN countries. Preliminary evidence of stakeholders' involvement in selected <b>subregional</b> <b>cooperation</b> initiatives in also presented. Although all GMS countries have experienced rapid growth over the past 15 years, no evidence is found that participation of CLMV in <b>subregional</b> <b>cooperation</b> and integration initiatives has led to a narrowing of the gap between the least and most developed GMS and ASEAN countries. While significant {{progress has been made in}} reducing poverty, within-country inequality also increased during that period. In addition, while intra-GMS and intra-ASEAN trade both increased, trade of Cambodia and Lao PDR with other GMS or ASEAN countries remain small. If the various <b>subregional</b> <b>cooperation</b> frameworks are to significantly reduce the development gap among members, activities more directly aimed at this objective may need to be emphasized. Re-thinking institutional arrangements for regional cooperation at both the national and subregional/regional levels may be considered in order to facilitate participation of a more representative set of stakeholders in the prioritization of activities and to ensure synergies between the various initiatives can be captured.

The strong sense of ownership of these organizations by member states, preferred creditor status, and professional management is reflected in very healthy portfolios, even in the face of default by member countries.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the participation of China’s Yunnan Province in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) {{in order to understand}} the dynamics behind the regionalisation and internationalisation strategies adopted by a Chinese subnational state. It argues that the Yunnan case demonstrates the outflow of state capital—both national and provincially based—to have been instrumental in harnessing Beijing’s and Kunming’s political support for programs of <b>subregional</b> economic <b>cooperation.</b> This political support has led to a state capital alliance underpinning the economic expansion of provincial state capital into the GMS. It also argues that subregional governance arrangements, such as those featuring in the GMS, embed the competitive advantage of state capital through new forms of extra-territorial governance that ostensibly de-emphasises the political dimensions of state capital. The internationalisation of Yunnan subnational state is reflected in its political strategy of subregional governance.

40|$|Natural {{capital has}} been a key {{contributor}} to the subregion’s rapid economic growth over the past 3 decades or so. However, the subregion’s key natural capital stocks {{are in a state}} of decline. This is evident by the degradation of arable land; considerable losses in forests, wetlands, and mangroves; and many species of fauna and flora becoming endangered or even extinct. The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) is poised to continue developing at a significant pace. The subregion is well placed to benefit from the emerging Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community due to its strategic geographic positioning, extensive subregional connectivity, and strong sense of community established through 2 decades of <b>subregional</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The GMS Regional Investment Framework Implementation Plan (2014 – 2018), comprising a pipeline of prioritized investment projects worth over $ 30 billion and approved by GMS leaders at the 5 th GMS Summit in Bangkok in December 2014, is indicative of the subregion’s development potential. However, the sustainability of the subregion’s future prosperity could be undermined unless the GMS invests significantly more in safeguarding and enhancing its natural capital. Indeed, in the context of the subregion’s vulnerability to climate change, natural disasters, and human-induced shocks, investments in natural capital present some of the most economically viable and socially inclusive adaptation and resilience strategies. Investing in natural capital will greatly help the GMS realize inclusive and sustainable development. Below are key messages from this report on natural capital in the GM...|$|E

30|$|Due to its {{long-term}} negative health effects and increasing emissions, the PM 2.5 issue has caused rising concerns in recent years. Although official media from East Asian countries tend to avoid blaming PM emission sources on their neighboring countries, researches have proved {{the existence of}} pronounced long-range trans-boundary particulate matters transported by nature force and by human activities. In this context, this paper included the structural path analysis (SPA) to quantify trans-boundary PM 2.5 at sector level, track its transaction paths and figure out the linkages between consumption and production responsibilities of China, Japan and Korea. Based on the results and policy reviews of current environmental cooperation mechanisms, this paper found that: Considering the China–Japan and China–Korea trades, China’s net exportation of embodied PM 2.5 emissions has exceeded the importation rates over 10 times (CHN → JPN, 56.53  kt, JPN → CHN, 3.58  kt; CHN → KOR, 59.19  kt, KOR → CHN, 5.31  kt). Japan and Korea benefited from importing raw materials with high emission intensity from China to meet domestic consumption needs and keep a low national emission level. China, the largest emitter in the world, should first take the responsibility to mitigate its huge domestic PM 2.5 emission. However, the relocated emissions from its neighboring countries should not be ignored. For Japan or Korea, due to the close economic interdependence and geographical position, any contribution to {{the reduction of the}} trans-boundary emissions or to the solution of atmosphere problems within China also helps those countries themselves. In the long run, all three countries would benefit from enhancing <b>subregional</b> environmental <b>cooperation.</b>|$|R
40|$|Although {{the overall}} {{economic}} performance of economies in South Asia {{in recent years}} has been impressive, there is concern that an aging and increasingly inadequate infrastructure may limit the potential for further growth and economic development. A critical infrastructure component is the transportation network, and there are currently several transportation infrastructure projects in the South Asia <b>Subregional</b> Economic <b>Cooperation</b> (SASEC) region, connecting Nepal, eastern India, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. This paper uses computable general equilibrium (CGE) methods to address how these infrastructure developments might affect the broader economy in SASEC, and in particular impact on income distribution and poverty. The paper describes a new CGE model for South Asia, covering India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan, which incorporates modifications to household structure in order to capture the implications of reform for changes in intra-household income. The scenarios that are considered reflect proposed investments in land transport infrastructure in the SASEC region. These should result in reductions in the land transport component of international transport margins, which vary bilaterally by commodity. We found that all SASEC economies would benefit from the reductions in terms of aggregate welfare, with the largest gains accruing to India in absolute terms, but the largest relative gains to Nepal, followed by Bangladesh and Sri Lanka when the margin reduction is prorated to intra-South Asian trade rather than just SASEC. In terms of household level distribution, the picture was mixed, with clearly pro-poor outcomes in some countries, such as Nepal, but more ambiguous impacts in others. In terms of potential adjustment costs, examination of the extent of predicted structural changes suggests that these would be minor, although somewhat more significant for the smaller economies in the region. cge method; infrastructure development; sasec; income distribution poverty reduction...|$|R
