5|$|Banksia oligantha {{is listed}} as an {{endangered}} species under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and as rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. These rankings are due to its small and severely fragmented distribution, and the ongoing degradation of its habitat. Threats include grazing by sheep and rabbits, drought, the drift of aerosol chemicals from surrounding farmland, invasion by weeds, and rising salinity. Studies have <b>shown</b> <b>it</b> to be moderately susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
5|$|Research {{is ongoing}} {{on the use}} of metformin, a {{diabetes}} medication, in obese women with endometrial cancer before surgery. Early research has <b>shown</b> <b>it</b> to be effective in slowing the rate of cancer cell proliferation. Preliminary research has shown that preoperative metformin administration can reduce expression of tumor markers. Long-term use of metformin has not been shown to have a preventative effect against developing cancer, but may improve overall survival.|$|E

Rome had <b>shown</b> <b>it</b> was capable of pitting its armies successfully against the dominant military powers of the Mediterranean, and that the Greek kingdoms were incapable of defending their colonies in Italy and abroad. Rome quickly moved into southern Italia, subjugating and dividing the Greek colonies. Now, Rome effectively dominated the Italian peninsula, and won an international military reputation.|$|E
5|$|While Drive {{is set in}} {{the present}} day, it carries a heavy 1980s {{atmosphere}} that is cautiously set from beginning to end and is underlined not only by the vehicles or music and clothes, but also by its architecture. The parts of the city seen in the Valley and by downtown Los Angeles are cheap stucco and mirrored glass, often leaving out more contemporary buildings. Drab background settings include the southern California commercial strip. As the Los Angeles Times pointed out, whenever gleaming buildings are <b>shown,</b> <b>it</b> is because they are being seen from a distance. Refn shot those scenes from a helicopter at night in Bunker Hill, Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Amanita daucipes is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, and its fruit bodies may {{be found}} growing solitary or scattered {{on the ground in}} mixed coniferous and deciduous forests (especially those dominated by oak trees) in Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Texas; other associated tree species include hickory (genus Carya) and birch (Betula). A predilection for disturbed soil, such as roadsides, has been noted. Amanita authority Cornelis Bas, writing in his extensive 1969 monograph on the genus, claimed A.daucipes to be a rare species; subsequent investigations have <b>shown</b> <b>it</b> to be common in oak forests in the eastern United States. The southern end of its distribution extends to Sonora, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Fielding altered and rewrote The Author's Farce for {{its second}} run {{beginning}} on 21 April 1730, when it shared the bill with his earlier play Tom Thumb. This combination continued through May and June {{and was later}} billed for a revival on 3 July 1730. Starting on 1 August 1730, the third act of The Author's Farce was revived by the Little Theatre {{during the week of}} the Tottenham Court fair. On 17 October 1730 an advertisement in the Daily Post announced that a new prologue was to be added. A version without the prologue followed before the play's run ended, to be replaced by The Beggar's Wedding by Charles Coffey. The Author's Farce was briefly revived in November 1730 and January 1731, but only the first two acts of the play were <b>shown.</b> <b>It</b> was paired with the afterpiece Damon and Phillida, which was later replaced by The Jealous Taylor in January 1731. Performances continued into February and March 1731. Productions in 1732 included a new prologue, now lost, that had been added for the 10 May 1731 performance.|$|E
5|$|The band {{met at the}} Londonderry Hotel on Park Lane, {{overlooking}} the park, where they had booked a tenth-floor suite, and proceeded to the park in the armoured personnel carrier, together with their two official photographers, Michael Cooper and Spanish Tony Sanchez. They alighted from the carrier into a caravan-trailer behind the stage. Jagger, his face heavily made up and with a studded leather collar around his neck, was clad in a white dress. He had borrowed the dress, which had been made for Sammy Davis Jr. at the Mr. Fish boutique, and wore it to Prince Rupert Lowenstein's white ball, where he had <b>shown</b> <b>it</b> to Princess Margaret. Jagger was only to wear it for half-an-hour at the Hyde Park concert, after which he tore it off to reveal a violet T-shirt and white loon pants.|$|E
5|$|The one reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1000 feet long, {{was released}} on July 29, 1910. The film likely had a wide release, but another film {{of the same name}} was released by Società Anonima Ambrosio. The Ambrosio film {{was released on}} November 16, 1910, but several theater advertisements are ambiguous as to the film being <b>shown.</b> <b>It</b> is known that Ambroiso and Thanhouser films were sometimes shown together, as one Maryland theater advertisement shows, further complicating identification. The film received mainly positive reviews from critics. The Morning Telegraph found the story to have a novel way of advertising a hotel, but noted the error in the photographer's attempt and result to photograph the mermaid. The Moving Picture World found the film to be an effective production, but spared few details and a short summary of the film. The most critical review came from The New York Dramatic Mirror which was neutral in its assessment of the production, but it provided a list of faults with the production that focused on continuity issues with action.|$|E

Our respect for the dead, when they are just dead, is something wonderful, and the way we <b>show</b> <b>it</b> more wonderful still. We <b>show</b> <b>it</b> with black feathers and black horses; we <b>show</b> <b>it</b> with black dresses and bright heraldries; we <b>show</b> <b>it</b> with costly obelisks and sculptures of sorrow, which spoil half of our most beautiful cathedrals. We <b>show</b> <b>it</b> with frightful gratings and vaults, and lids of dismal stone, {{in the midst of the}} quiet grass; and last, and not least, we <b>show</b> <b>it</b> by permitting ourselves to tell any number of lies we think amiable or credible, in the epitaph. This feeling is common to the poor as well as the rich; and we all know how many a poor family will nearly ruin themselves, to testify their respect for some member of it in his coffin, whom they never much cared for when he was out of it; and how often it happens that a poor old woman will starve herself to death, in order that she may be respectably buried.|$|R
