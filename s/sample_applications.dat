2500|$|Gas chromatography–mass {{spectrometry}} (GC-MS) is {{an analytical}} method that combines {{the features of}} gas-chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify different substances within a test <b>sample.</b> <b>Applications</b> of GC-MS include drug detection, fire investigation, environmental analysis, explosives investigation, and identification of unknown samples, including that of material samples obtained from planet Mars during [...] probe missions {{as early as the}} 1970s. GC-MS can also be used in airport security to detect substances in luggage or on human beings. Additionally, it can identify trace elements in materials that were previously thought to have disintegrated beyond identification. Like liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, it allows analysis and detection even of tiny amounts of a substance.|$|E

40|$|This work aims {{to present}} a {{historical}} overview and analysis on the current technical details within one category of Augmented Reality systems – Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR). In addition, this research shows what practical and enjoyable mobile applications {{can be made with}} MAR.   A <b>sample</b> <b>application</b> has been developed for demonstration. The general aim of this <b>sample</b> <b>application</b> is to develop a room number recognition system using Augmented Reality technology. The work has demonstrated that an Android mobile phone equipped with this <b>sample</b> <b>application</b> can overlay augmented room schedule onto the mobile screen. Several experiments were carried out to evaluate the application. Recognition rate is an average of 91 % in continuous real time testing. The application is also tested for varying viewing angles as well as different distances between the hand-held device and the targets to be tracked. Some cases of failure have been identified and shown. Future work and results of an evaluation are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|We report continuous-flow <b>sample</b> <b>application</b> and con-tinuous electrophoretic {{separation}} on {{a moving}} cellulose acetate tape. This very simple automated electrophoretic system requires minimum electronic control circuitry. Samples and calibrators are pumped by a peristaltic pump from sample containers onto a continuously moving cel-lulose acetate tape. Applied samples are interspaced with rinse solution (buffer) and small air segments for sample integrity. Electrophoretic separation, staining, and de-staining are all continuous functions {{performed on the}} continuously moving tape. The system appears suitable for separation of proteins. Continuous-flow application could be combined with discrete <b>sample</b> <b>application</b> onto the same tape for continuous counter-immunoelectro-phoresis; moreover, counter-electrophoresis of tw...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved Sample/Hold (S/H) circuit design for analog LCD applications. The circuit possesses the dual characteristics of high sampling precision and low switch noise and is, thus, suitable for video signal <b>sampling</b> <b>applications.</b> In {{order to increase}} accuracy of sampling and to reduce switch noise, the design uses an operational amplifier with current-mode switch, which incorporates an improved buffer amplifier, and introduces a noise elimination technique by using differential amplifier. The simulation results show that for a typical signal <b>sampling</b> <b>application</b> and its Bi-CMOS implementation, the design has achieved a minimal signal distortion and significantly reduced noise effect...|$|R
