40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} cirrhosis on peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and choroidal thickness with enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography. Methods: This cross <b>sectional,</b> single <b>center</b> study was undertaken at Bulent Ecevit University Ophthalmology department with the participation of internal medicine, Gastroenterology department. Patients who were treated with the diagnosis of cirrhosis (n= 75) were examined in the ophthalmology clinic. Age and sex matched patients (n= 50) who were healthy and met the inclusion, exclusion criteria {{were included in the}} study. Complete ophthalmological examination included visual acuity with Snellen chart, intraocular pressure measurement with applanation tonometry, biomicroscopy of anterior and posterior segments, gonioscopy, axial length measurement, visual field examination, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, central macular and subfoveal choroidal thickness measurements. Results: The difference between intraocular pressure values was not statistically significant between cirrhosis and control group (p= 0. 843). However, mean peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was significantly thinner in cirrhosis group in all regions (p< 0. 001) and subfoveal choroidal thickness was significantly thinner in cirrhosis group also (p< 0. 001). Moreover, central macular thickness of cirrhosis group was significantly thicker than the control group (p= 0. 001). Conclusion: Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and subfoveal choroidal thickness was significantly thinner in cirrhosis patients...|$|R
50|$|In general, {{the first}} three digits {{designate}} a <b>sectional</b> <b>center</b> facility, the mail sorting and distribution center for an area. A <b>sectional</b> <b>center</b> facility may {{have more than one}} three-digit code assigned to it. For example, the Northern Virginia <b>sectional</b> <b>center</b> facility in Merrifield is assigned codes 220, 221, 222 and 223. In some cases, a <b>sectional</b> <b>center</b> facility may serve an area in an adjacent state, usually {{due to the lack of}} a proper location for a center in that region. For example, 739 in Oklahoma is assigned to Liberal, Kansas; 865 in Arizona is assigned to Gallup, New Mexico; and 961 in California to Reno, Nevada.|$|E
50|$|In {{rapidly growing}} communities, it is {{sometimes}} necessary {{to open a new}} <b>sectional</b> <b>center</b> facility, which must then be allocated its own three-digit ZIP-code prefix or prefixes. Such allocation can be done in various ways. For example, when a new <b>sectional</b> <b>center</b> facility was opened at Dulles Airport in Virginia, the prefix 201 was allocated to that facility; therefore, for all post offices to be served by that <b>sectional</b> <b>center</b> facility the ZIP Code changed from an old code beginning with 220 or 221 to a new code or codes beginning with 201. However, when a new <b>sectional</b> <b>center</b> facility was opened to serve Montgomery County, Maryland, no new prefix was assigned. Instead, ZIP Codes in the 207 and 208 ranges, which had previously been assigned alphabetically, were reshuffled so that 207xx ZIP Codes in the county were changed to 208xx codes, while 208xx codes outside that county were changed to 207xx codes. Because Silver Spring (whose postal area includes Wheaton) has its own prefix, 209, {{there was no need to}} apply the reshuffling to Silver Spring; instead, all mail going to 209xx ZIP Codes was simply rerouted to the new <b>sectional</b> <b>center</b> facility.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{numerical}} analysis of two interacting lifting surfaces separated in the spanwise direction by a narrow gap are presented. The configuration consists of a semispan wing with the last 32 percent of the span structurally separated from the inboard section. The angle of attack of the outboard section is set independently {{from that of the}} inboard section. In the present study, the three-dimensional panel code VSAERO is used to perform the analysis. Computed values of tip surface lift and pitching moment coefficients are correlated with experimental data to determine the proper approach to model the gap region between the surfaces. Pitching moment data for various tip planforms are also presented to show how the variation of tip pitching moment with angle of attack may be increased easily in incompressible flow. Calculated three-dimensional characteristics in compressible flow at Mach numbers of 0. 5 and 0. 7 are presented for new tip planform designs. An analysis of <b>sectional</b> aerodynamic <b>center</b> shift as a function of Mach number is also included for a representative tip planform. It is also shown that the induced drag of the tip surface is reduced for negative incidence angles relative to the inboard section. The results indicate that this local drag reduction overcomes the associated increase in wing induced drag at high wing lift coefficients...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To analyze visual {{morbidity}} {{attributable to}} primary glaucoma, its eight-year dynamics, and gender differences in Siberian industrial town inhabitants. Methods: Medical records (out-patient and in-patient departments) from the database of the <b>sectional</b> information analysis <b>center</b> of Novokuznetsk Health Administration over an eight-year period (2004 - 2011) were studied. Individual patients diagnosed with primary glaucoma in 2004 ‑ 2011 were reviewed only. Results: Standardized primary glaucoma morbidity rate {{in men and}} women aged over 40 years was 3. 5 ± 0. 3 ‰ and  2. 6 ± 0. 26 ‰, respectively. Men were diagnosed with primary glaucoma earlier than women. In male residents aged over  70 years, primary glaucoma was found more often than in female residents. Male glaucoma patients required in-patient treatment more often than female patients. Primary glaucoma was diagnosed in men and women at 66. 1 ± 11. 6 and  67. 0 ± 10. 9 years (on average), respectively (U = 2. 27, p = 0. 023). 441 of 5424 patients (8. 1 %) diagnosed with glaucoma in 2004 ‑ 2011 subsequently died. The average age at death was 69. 0 ± 7. 2 years, the median (25 %; 75 %) was 71 years (66 years; 75 years). Patients who were diagnosed with primary glaucoma survived for 2. 6 ± 1. 8 years. The median (25 %;  75 %) was 2 years (1 year; 4 years). The distribution of the variable that characterized {{the difference between the}} age at death and the age of diagnosis making was abnormal (D = 0. 151, p< 0. 001). Half of glaucoma patients died in the first two years after glaucoma has been diagnosed. Less than 20 % of patients (16 % men, 18 % women) survived for ≥ 4 years after primary glaucoma diagnosis has been made. Conclusion: The analysis of morbidity and mortality rates as well as disability due to impaired vision is of great importance to health official and practitioners. Stably low glaucoma morbidity rate in Siberian industrial town inhabitants indicates a great lack of glaucoma specialists and forces to develop optimal organizational arrangements as well as observational and treatment approaches to glaucoma care. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction and {{aim of the}} workObesity is {{established}} as an important contributor of increased diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, {{all of which can}} promote chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recently, there is a growing appreciation that {{even in the absence of}} these risks, obesity itself significantly increases CKD and accelerates its progression. The aim of this work is to evaluate the link between Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) and FGF 23 -Klotho- 1, 25 D 3 axis and their impact in obese and non-obese CKD patients. Patients and methods In a cross <b>sectional</b> randomized multi <b>centers</b> study, two hundred twenty six CKD patients stage III and IV (eGFR 20 - 60 ml/min/m 2) have enrolled in this study as follows: group I; 87 non diabetic CKD patients aged 20 - 40 years with body mass index (BMI) between 20 - 25 kgm/m 2; group II; 130 non diabetic CKD patients aged 20 - 40 years with (BMI) > 30 kgm/m 2 and group III; 89 CKD patients aged > 60 years. All patient have been tested for plasma leptinlevels, 1, 25 -dihydrocholicalciferole (1, 25 D 3), plasmaparathormone (PTH) Serum calcium (Ca), serum phosphorus (PO 4), and plasma FGF- 23, plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma angiotensinogen receptor 1 & 2 (AT 1 & AT 2) and plasma aldosterone (ALD) and pulse wave velocity (PWV). Results The eGFR was significantly reduced in the obese group II (eGFR= 37. 7 ± 13. 6) when compared with eGFR of the lean group I (eGFR= 49. 3 ± 7. 51) were P< 0. 001, but not significant when compared with the old age group III (eGFR= 41. 0 ± 13. 47). The obese group II shows significant increase in the ALD/PRA ratio when compared with the lean group I and old age group III (43. 23 ± 14. 9) for group II vs 11. 29 ± 4. 1 for group I, P< 0. 001 and 24. 91 ± 12. 1 for group III, P< 0. 05). Regarding the FGF 23 -Klotho-vitD 3 axis, its components of the obese group II (FGF 23 259. 55 ± 138. 6 Ru/ml; PTH 77. 63 ±X 32. 4 pg/ml; S. PO 4. 74 ± 1. 61 mg/dl) were significantly elevated when compared to the lean group I (FGF 23 132. 81 ± 126. 1 Ru/ml; PTH 59. 18 ± 24. 7 pg/ml; S. PO 4 3. 85 ± 0. 92 mg/dl); the P values were < 0. 001, < 0. 01 and < 0. 05 respectively, while when compared with the old age group III (FGF 23 179. 33 ± 237. 4 Ru/ml; PTH 70. 94 ± 15. 26 pg/ml; S. PO 4 4. 09 ± 0. 42 mg/dl), values were of less significance. Plasma insulin levels were significantly high in the obese group II (insulin= 13. 73 ± 2. 38 fg/l) than the lean group I (insulin= 5. 59 ± 2. 31 fg/l) and P< 0. 001 and in group III p. insulin level was 10. 7 ± 1. 68 (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{manpower}} planning problem receives {{considerable attention}} by {{the management of}} service organizations because they are typically labor intensive. Not only must optimal staff sizes be determined over an extended horizon, but optimal staff schedules which assign labor to tours of duty and specific tasks, given the available staff size, must also be found. Adding to the complexity arising from the interrelatedness of the staff-sizing and staff-scheduling problems is {{the existence of the}} conflicting multiple objectives of minimizing costs and maximizing customer service. The few methodologies reported in the literature which treat the complete manpower planning problem as stated above have several shortcomings. Some techniques place a severe strain on computational capabilities. Also, these methods confound the specification of the goal levels with the analysis of the relative goal weightings. Often the specification of the desired goal levels is made at a different level in the organizational hierarchy than the specification of the relative importance of the various goals. This paper suggests an approach which overcomes these shortcomings. The methodology utilizes a simulation model with an imbedded heuristic procedure for the staff-scheduling problem to identify realistic aggregate staff-size goals to be used in a multiple-objective staff-sizing model. The methodology is applied to the manpower planning problem of a large <b>sectional</b> <b>center</b> post office and the managerial benefits are discussed. ...|$|E
