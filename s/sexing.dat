Their weight may have varied substantially due to fat cycles, meaning that individuals were fat during cool seasons, but slim during hot seasons, and may have been as low as 21kg in males and 13kg in females. Though male pigeons are usually larger than females, there is no direct evidence for the largest specimens actually being the males of the species, and this has only been assumed based on early works.

40|$|Background. In South Africa, {{information}} on <b>sex</b> workers' characteristics, sexual behaviour and health needs is limited. Current social, legal and institutional factors impede a safe working environment for <b>sex</b> {{workers and their}} clients. Objectives. To describe characteristics and sexual behaviour of female, male and transgender <b>sex</b> workers, and assess their risk factors for unprotected <b>sex.</b> Methods. Repeat cross-sectional surveys among <b>sex</b> workers were conducted in Hillbrow, Sandton, Rustenburg and Cape Town in 2010. <b>Sex</b> workers were interviewed once; any re-interviews were excluded from analysis. Unprotected <b>sex</b> was defined as any unprotected penetrative vaginal or anal <b>sex</b> with last two clients. Results. Trained <b>sex</b> worker-research assistants interviewed 1 799 <b>sex</b> workers. <b>Sex</b> work was a full-time profession for most participants. About 8 % (126 / 1 594) of women, 33 % (22 / 75) of men, and 25 % (12 / 50) of transgender people had unprotected <b>sex.</b> A quarter of anal <b>sex</b> was unprotected. Unprotected <b>sex</b> was 2. 1 times (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 95 % CI 1. 2 - 3. 7; p= 0. 011) more likely in participants reporting daily or weekly binge drinking than non-binge drinkers. Male <b>sex</b> workers were 2. 9 times (AOR, 95 % CI 1. 6 - 5. 3; p< 0. 001) more likely, and transgender people 2. 4 times (AOR, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 4. 9; p= 0. 021) more likely, than females to have unprotected <b>sex.</b> <b>Sex</b> workers in Hillbrow, where the only <b>sex</b> work-specific clinic was operational, {{were less likely to}} have unprotected <b>sex</b> than those in other sites.

40|$|BackgroundDaily HIV {{antiretroviral}} {{pre-exposure prophylaxis}} (PrEP) is being evaluated {{in clinical trials}} among men who have <b>sex</b> with men (MSM). However, daily PrEP may not be congruent with sexual exposure profiles of MSM. Here, we investigate <b>sex</b> frequency and <b>sex</b> planning to identify and inform appropriate PrEP strategies for MSM. MethodsWe evaluated <b>sex</b> frequency and <b>sex</b> planning in a cohort of HIV-negative MSM in Bangkok, Thailand. Chi-squared {{test was used to}} compare reports of <b>sex</b> on different weekdays; logistic regression was used to identify predictors of <b>sex</b> frequency and <b>sex</b> planning. ResultsOf 823 MSM (with a mean age of 28. 3 years), 86 % reported having <b>sex</b> on two days per week or less, and 65 % reported their last <b>sex</b> to have been planned. <b>Sex</b> on the weekend (~ 30 %) was more often reported than <b>sex</b> on weekdays (~ 23 %). In multivariate analysis, use of alcohol, erectile dysfunction drugs, group <b>sex,</b> <b>sex</b> with a foreigner, buying and selling <b>sex,</b> and a history of HIV testing were associated with having <b>sex</b> on three days or more per week. Being aged 22 to 29 years, not identifying as homosexual, having receptive anal intercourse, and not engaging in group <b>sex</b> were associated with unplanned <b>sex.</b> ConclusionsIntermittently dosed PrEP (as opposed to daily) may be a feasible HIV prevention strategy and should be considered for evaluation in clinical trials. Risk factors for <b>sex</b> frequency and <b>sex</b> planning may help to identify those in need for daily PrEP and those who {{may not be able to}} take a timely pre-exposure dose...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} combine {{theoretical}} and empirical approaches to gain more insights {{in the evolution of}} <b>sex</b> determining mechanisms. Although <b>sex</b> determination is a fundamental developmental process, <b>sex</b> determining mechanisms are not conserved in evolution, but can vary between closely related species. Most species have a single <b>sex</b> determining mechanism, such as the XY system in humans. In the housefly multiple <b>sex</b> determining factors occur, both on <b>sex</b> chromosomes and autosomes allowing for different <b>sex</b> determining systems. The housefly can therefore be used to empirically study evolution of <b>sex</b> determining mechanisms. Fieldwork confirmed the existence of different <b>sex</b> determining factors with autosomal factors being most abundant in southern and the XY system in northern European populations. This distribution appears stable with temperature as the main causal factor. However, laboratory experiments did not unequivocally reveal how temperature selects for different <b>sex</b> determining factors. Several selective forces can be involved in the evolution of <b>sex</b> determination in the housefly, including fertility selection, <b>sex</b> ratio selection and genetic conflict. The theoretical models bring general insights into the evolution of <b>sex</b> determining mechanisms. They show that genetic constraints and selection against infertile intersexes may prevent <b>sex</b> ratio adaptations. Maternal-offspring conflict over <b>sex</b> ratio may lead to rapid switches between different <b>sex</b> determining mechanisms alternated by periods of apparent stability in which the population <b>sex</b> ratio and frequency of different <b>sex</b> determining factors do not change. Selfish genetic elements such as driving <b>sex</b> chromosomes may also induce changes in <b>sex</b> determining mechanisms. They can be secondarily lost from the population, making inferring past selective forces from the current variation in <b>sex</b> determining mechanisms difficult. It is argued that mechanistic models are especially useful in studying the evolution of <b>sex</b> determination. ...|$|R

Although this does not reflect the status of evolutionary theory on <b>sex</b> determination and sexual dimorphism, it is probably a common view among evolutionary biologists as well, because of the impact of sexual selection theory. To get away from thinking about biological <b>sex</b> and traits associated with a particular <b>sex</b> as something static, it should be recognized that in an evolutionary perspective <b>sex</b> {{can be viewed as a}} reaction norm, with <b>sex</b> attributes being phenotypically plastic. <b>Sex</b> determination itself is fundamentally plastic, even when it is termed ‘‘genetic’’.
