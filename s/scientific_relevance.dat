40|$|Abstract — Recently {{the use of}} {{data mining}} to {{scientific}} bibliographic data bases has been implemented to analyze the pathways of the knowledge or the core <b>scientific</b> <b>relevances</b> of a laureated novel or a country. This specific case of data mining has been named citation mining, {{and it is the}} integration of citation bibliometrics and text mining. In this paper we present an improved WEB implementation of statistical physics algorithms to perform the text mining component of citation mining. In particular we use an entropic like distance between the compression of text as an indicator of the similarity between them. Finally, we have included the recently proposed index h to characterize the scientific production. We have used this web implementation to identify users, applications and impact of the Mexican scientific institutions located in the State of Morelos...|$|R

The project is based on a software system whose major assumption is to attack crosswords making use of the Web as its primary source of knowledge.|$|E

Although the <b>scientific</b> <b>relevance</b> of Weyerman's sources is questioned, it is still assumed that Schut was a pupil of Rubens since Rubens was exempted from registering his pupils with the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. Because Schut's early works are closer to the style of the leading Antwerp history painter Abraham Janssens, some connection with the workshop of Abraham Janssens may have existed although it does not prove he was Janssens' pupil. Schut became a master of the Antwerp Guild of St Luke in 1618.|$|E

50|$|In May 1410, King Sigismund {{entrusted}} Stibor and the Palatine Nicholas II Garai {{to mediate}} between the Teutonic Knights and King Władysław II of Poland, but when negotiations failed, war broke out. The Battle of Grunwald took place, with {{almost all of}} the Ostojas leaving Hungary to join Polish forces. However, Stibor and his brother Andrzej (Andrew) together with their sons, remained loyal to the Emperor. Instead, Stibor led small the Hungarian army to attack Poland from the South. Because of the diplomatic work of Stibor of Stiboricz, Sigismund abandoned hostile actions against Poland and turned to support the wealthy and mighty Teutonic Knights by signing never executed agreements in to order to gain financial benefit to protect his own Empire for the Ottoman threat. Leading King's army against Poland was mostly marking the support to the Teutonic Knights rather to do any serious damage. Few places have been burned down but Stibor's army did not siege of any stronghold, which Stibor easily could do leading elite army forces and well equipped. After burning down the land of Stary Sącz, Stibor's army turned back to Hungary in order to prepare the peace negotiations between Poland and Hungary. In several Polish sources, there is a legend noted that small Polish army chased the army of Stibor and defeated him in small battle. Having in mind that Stibor of Stiboricz and his army, defeated several Principalities and burned down entire Austria except Vienna, being victorious general in almost all the battles including against at the time powerful Venetian Empire, those rumors have no <b>scientific</b> <b>relevance,</b> they are rather falsification of the history in order to glorify Polish victory over Teutonic Knights.|$|E
