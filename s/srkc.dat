40|$|The trkB gene encodes a {{tyrosine}} kinase receptor, gpl 45 trkB, for {{brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} (BDNF) and neurotrophin- 4 (NT- 4). To understand the role of gpl 45 ” 8 in the nervous system, we have investigated its expression in embryonic rat hippocampal pyramidal cell cultures and {{examined the effects of}} BDNF on signal transduction in the primary neurons. The expression of trkB transcripts was established by PCR analysis and in situ hybridization. In addition to gp 145 ’rk 8, the pyramidal neuronal cultures expressed transcripts specific for the NT- 3 receptor gp 14 <b>Srkc,</b> but not for the high-affinity NGF receptor gp 140 ” or for p 7 SWGFR, a low-affinity receptor for all known members of the NGF family of neurotrophins including the gpl 45 *k 8 ligands, BDNF and NT- 4. The presence of gp 145 rrkB receptors in the primary neuronal cultures was confirmed by immunocytochemica...|$|E
