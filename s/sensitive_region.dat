500|$|In 1898, Ludwig Boltzmann, in his Lectures on Gas Theory, {{used the}} theory of valence to explain the {{phenomenon}} of gas phase molecular dissociation, {{and in doing so}} drew one of the first rudimentary yet detailed atomic orbital overlap drawings. [...] Noting first the known fact that molecular iodine vapor dissociates into atoms at higher temperatures, Boltzmann states that we must explain the existence of molecules composed of two atoms, the “double atom” as Boltzmann calls it, by an attractive force acting between the two atoms. [...] Boltzmann states that this chemical attraction, owing to certain facts of chemical valence, must be associated with a relatively small region {{on the surface of the}} atom called the <b>sensitive</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Photothyristors are {{activated}} by light. The advantage of photothyristors is their insensitivity to electrical signals, {{which can cause}} faulty operation in electrically noisy environments. A light-triggered thyristor (LTT) has an optically <b>sensitive</b> <b>region</b> in its gate, into which electromagnetic radiation (usually infrared) is coupled by an optical fiber. [...] Since no electronic boards need to be provided at {{the potential of the}} thyristor in order to trigger it, light-triggered thyristors can be an advantage in high-voltage applications such as HVDC. [...] Light-triggered thyristors are available with in-built over-voltage (VBO) protection, which triggers the thyristor when the forward voltage across it becomes too high; [...] they have also been made with in-built forward recovery protection, but not commercially. Despite the simplification they can bring to the electronics of an HVDC valve, light-triggered thyristors may still require some simple monitoring electronics and are only available from a few manufacturers.|$|E

40|$|The sensitivities of {{meteorological}} forecast errors {{associated with}} Asian dust transport events {{to changes in}} the initial state were evaluated for 46 occurrences that affected the Korean Peninsula from 2005 to 2010. Adjoint-based sensitivities were used to determine these sensitivities. <b>Sensitive</b> <b>regions</b> were located primarily over two regions upstream from the Korean Peninsula: the northern source region, including areas of Mongolia and northern China, and the Tibetan Plateau. Depending on transport trajectories, month, and year, the <b>sensitive</b> <b>regions</b> were located over either the northern source regions or the Tibetan Plateau. That is, the Asian dust forecast in Korea was found {{to be sensitive to the}} meteorological fields over the northern source regions, but also those over the Tibetan Plateau even though the latter is not a dust source region or an upstream area according to the transport trajectories. Employing additional observations at existing instrumentation sites or developing new observational sites in both <b>sensitive</b> <b>regions</b> could be beneficial in reducing the atmospheric circulation forecast errors in East Asia, thus improving the accuracy of transport forecasts of Asian dust events affecting the Korean Peninsula...|$|R

5000|$|Just {{above the}} cold {{condenser}} plate {{there is an}} area of the chamber which is sensitive to radioactive tracks. At this height, most of the alcohol has not condensed. This means that the ion trail left by the radioactive particles provides an optimal trigger for condensation and cloud formation. This sensitive area is increased in height by employing a steep temperature gradient, little convection, and very stable conditions. A strong electric field is often used to draw cloud tracks down to the <b>sensitive</b> <b>region</b> of the chamber and increase the sensitivity of the chamber. The electric field can also serve to prevent large amounts of background [...] "rain" [...] from obscuring the <b>sensitive</b> <b>region</b> of the chamber, caused by condensation forming above the sensitive area of the chamber. This means that ion trails left by radioactive particles are obscured by constant precipitation. The black background makes it easier to observe cloud tracks.|$|E

40|$|The present essay reviews {{a series}} of {{functional}} magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies conducted in parallel in humans and awake monkeys, concentrating on the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). MR responses to a range of visual stimuli indicate that the human IPS contains more functional regions along its anterior-posterior extent than are known in the monkey. Human IPS includes four motion <b>sensitive</b> <b>regions,</b> ventral IPS (VIPS), parieto-occipital IPS (POIPS), dorsal IPS medial (DIPSM) and dorsal IPS anterior (DIPSA), which are also sensitive to three-dimensional structure from motion (3 D SFM). On the other hand, the monkey IPS contains only one motion sensitive area (VIP), which is not particularly sensitive to 3 D SFM. The human IPS includes four <b>regions</b> <b>sensitive</b> to two-dimensional shape and three representations of central vision, while monkey IPS appears to contain only two shape <b>sensitive</b> <b>regions</b> and one central representation. These data support the hypothesis that monkey LIP corresponds to the region of human IPS between DIPSM and POIPS and that a portion of the anterior part of human IPS is evolutionarily new. This additional cortical tissue may provide the capacity for an enhanced visual analysis of moving images necessary for sophisticated control of manipulation and tool handling. status: publishe...|$|R
