40|$|SUMMARY: Paper chromatographic {{methods were}} used to {{determine}} the amino acids in unhydrolysed corn <b>steep</b> <b>liquor</b> and to study the uptake and synthesis of amino acids by Penicillium chysogenum. Of the eleven amino acids found in corn <b>steep</b> <b>liquor</b> all were taken up by the organism prior to the main period of penicillin formation. Only traces of ninhydrin-reacting material were present in the later samples of medium.

30|$|Erythromycin {{is a kind}} of polyketide {{antibiotic}} {{produced by}} Saccharopolyspora erythraea through industrial fermentation. Recently, erythromycin has received much attention because its semi-synthetically modified derivatives, such as azithromycin, roxithromycin, and clarithromycin, are widely used in the treatment of infectious diseases [1],[2]. The high requirement of erythromycin market stimulates the research on the improvement of the production and productivity of erythromycin. It has been reported that the genetic engineering technology, such as Saccharopolyspora erythraea mutB knockout and artificial attB site, have been applied to improve erythromycin production [3],[4]. The variation of the medium composition and fermentation conditions also successfully improved the erythromycin productivity [5],[6]. Zou et al. reported that feeding corn <b>steep</b> <b>liquor</b> could regulate oxygen uptake rate (OUR) at a suitable level in the early phase of fermentation, elevate the intracellular levels of lactic acid, pyruvic acid, citric acid, and propionic acid, and ultimately enhance the metabolic flux of erythromycin biosynthesis [7]. It is well known that the quality of corn <b>steep</b> <b>liquor</b> is unstable due to its production process and the difficulty to be stored [8]. This led to the severe fluctuation of erythromycin production on industrial scale. In this study, yeast powder, a stable nitrogen source, was used to replace corn <b>steep</b> <b>liquor,</b> so that the erythromycin production could be maintained at a stable level.

In Kansas alone, this plant infests approximately 600, 000 acres of native range, reducing native grass production by up to 92 %. Increased grazing pressure on sericea lespedeza by beef cattle may slow its spread and facilitate some measure of biological control. Feedstuffs or feed additives with tannin-binding properties may promote voluntary consumption of this plant by grazing beef cattle. In previous studies, confined beef cattle fed polyethylene glycol daily ate more sericea lespedeza than cattle that were not fed polyethylene glycol; however, use of polyethylene glycol by commercial beef producers is problematic because feeding it at the rates necessary to increase intake of sericea lespedeza is cost-prohibitive and disallowed from a regulatory standpoint.
