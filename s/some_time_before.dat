5|$|Lydia Parker married {{shoemaker}} Cromwell Bixby on September 26, 1826, in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. The {{couple had}} at least six sons and three daughters before Cromwell's death in 1854. <b>Some</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> the Civil War, Bixby and her family settled in Boston.|$|E
5|$|Martino Zaccaria married, {{probably}} <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> 1325, Jacqueline de la Roche. An earlier conjecture of Karl Hopf about a {{first marriage}} to a daughter of George I Ghisi, heir to the lordship of Tinos and Mykonos, has since been discarded.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiocarbon}} dating {{of the human}} remains {{does not provide a}} date for the construction of Coldrum Long Barrow itself; {{it is possible that the}} individuals died either <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> or after the monument's construction.|$|E
50|$|The Annals of the Four Masters {{say that}} Katherine died in 1506 at 54 of the age, {{one year after}} the death of her husband. Her eldest son, Donnell, seized the throne of Hy-Carbery after his uncle's death, <b>some</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> Katherine was dead.|$|R

5|$|Aldfrith {{was said}} to have been ill for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> his death, dying on 14 December 704 or 705. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle adds that he died at Driffield in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The {{succession}} was disputed by Eadwulf, supported initially by Bishop Wilfrid, and supporters of Aldfrith's young son Osred, apparently led by Berht's kinsman Berhtfrith.|$|E
5|$|Christian Lee Novetzke of the University of Washington {{suggests}} that Vithoba's worship migrated from Karnataka to the formerly Shaiva city of Pandharpur <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> 1000CE; {{but under the}} possible influence of a Krishna-worshipping Mahanubhava sect, the town {{was transformed into a}} Vaishnava center of pilgrimage. This proposal is consistent with contemporary remnants of Shaiva worship in the town.|$|E
5|$|Diodorus {{stated that}} Alexander had given {{detailed}} written instructions to Craterus <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> his death. Craterus started {{to carry out}} Alexander's commands, but the successors chose not to further implement them, on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant. Nevertheless, Perdiccas read Alexander's will to his troops.|$|E

5|$|During the {{expedition}} of Hugh Cuming in 1827 and the 1922 Whitney South Sea Expedition, Lepturus grass {{was found on}} Acadia Islet. However, it disappeared when storm waves deforested the island <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> the Smithsonian expedition of 1975. Thus H. foertherianum now dominates the vegetation of the islets. Additionally, {{there are a number}} of species of coralline algae, including Porolithon onkodes, Porolithon gardineri, and Caulerpa racemosa.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} for the fanzine The Disused Yeti, Shanahan stated that although he and Parry had found paper records relating to the censoring of early to mid William Hartnell stories, the excised portions for all stories from An Unearthly Child to The Gunfighters had been destroyed <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> Shanahan and Parry's investigation.|$|E

5|$|Pain {{was born}} <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> 1100. His father {{may have been}} in the service of King Henry in Normandy before Henry became king. The family lands in England, which were not extensive, were mainly in East Anglia, and Pain appears to have {{inherited}} most of them; his payment for danegeld, a tax, in 1130 for his East Anglian properties was 40shillings, compared to only 9 shillings for his brother Eustace.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} did {{not appear}} to have any significant impact on German plans and was not reported high up the chain of command. It was executed <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> D-Day, {{and in the midst of}} several other Allied deceptions. German intelligence might have suspected a trick, or not attributed much importance to the visit.|$|E
5|$|The surname Golding {{is synonymous}} {{with a variety of}} hop known as Goldings and, {{although}} it is not certain who discovered the hop, it has been accredited to John Golding (who died <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> 1811), the great nephew of Thomas and the owner of Ditton Court, or to his son John (who died at Ditton Place in 1851).|$|E

The individual concerned had left the control room <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> the trouble started (see below) and his absence may have contributed to a lack of urgency in responding to events. Exactly what happened that night has never been established beyond doubt.|$|E
5|$|Wastek (also spelled Huastec and Huaxtec) {{is spoken}} in the Mexican states of Veracruz and San Luis Potosí by around 110,000 people. It {{is the most}} {{divergent}} of modern Mayan languages.

5|$|A Marvel One-Shot {{featuring}} Peggy Carter was in {{the works}} for <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> Atwell signed on to star in it, reprising her role from the Captain America films. D'Esposito, co-president of Marvel Studios and an executive producer on the feature films, aimed to replicate the period setting of Captain America: The First Avenger, while also giving the short a more modern, superhero feel. The film was a more ambitious production than previous One-Shots, with more action scenes and visual effects required than previously. Several other characters from Marvel Cinematic Universe films also appear, including Cooper reprising his role of Howard Stark.|$|E

5|$|Broad Ripple Park Carousel is {{an antique}} {{carousel}} in The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. It {{was installed in}} 1917 at an amusement park near the White River in Indianapolis, Indiana, where it remained until the building housing it collapsed in 1956. The ride's mechanism was destroyed, but the animals were relatively unscathed and put into storage by the park's owners, the Indianapolis Department of Parks and Recreation. The animals were carved by the Dentzel Carousel Company <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> 1900 but were assembled by the William F. Mangels carousel company, which also supplied the engine powering the ride.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{topography}} {{of the area}} in the vicinity of Scotch Run, the area near the stream was not settled until some time after the first settlement in the surrounding areas. Alexander McCauley settled on the stream in Beaver Township 1774. <b>Some</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> 1820, a carding mill was built by George Fleming on the stream southeast of Mainville. In 1820, it started {{to be used as a}} school, which was run by Jacob Gensel.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald came to {{the throne}} {{on the death of}} his father on 24 February 616, or {{possibly}} 618. Although Æthelberht had been Christian since about 600 and his wife Bertha was also Christian, Eadbald was a pagan. Bertha died <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> Eadbald's accession, and Æthelberht remarried. The name of Æthelberht's second wife is not recorded, but it seems likely that she was a pagan, since on his death she married Eadbald, her stepson: a marriage between a stepmother and stepson was forbidden by the church.|$|E
