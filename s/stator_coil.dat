50|$|Essential for the {{movement}} of the Lavet motor are the cogging points of the rotor, which differ depending on whether the <b>stator</b> <b>coil</b> is energized or unenergized. The cogging points with no current are caused by reluctant force against a direct magnetic field, rather than retarding the propagation of an alternating magnetic flux, and in practice are the angles where the air volume between the poles of the magnetic rotor and the bulk of the stator is minimised.|$|E
5000|$|Basic RVDT {{construction}} and operation {{is provided by}} rotating an iron-core bearing supported within a housed stator assembly. The housing is passivated stainless steel. The stator consists of a primary excitation coil {{and a pair of}} secondary output coils.A fixed alternating current excitation is applied to the primary <b>stator</b> <b>coil</b> that is electromagnetically coupled to the secondary coils. This coupling is proportional to the angle of the input shaft. The output pair is structured so that one coil is in-phase with the excitation coil, and the second is 180° out-of-phase with the excitation coil.When the rotor is in a position that directs the available flux equally in both the in-phase and out-of-phase coils, the output voltages cancel and result in a zero value signal. This {{is referred to as the}} electrical zero position or E.Z. When the rotor shaft is displaced from E.Z., the resulting output signals have a magnitude and phase relationship proportional to the direction of rotation.Because RVDTs perform essentially like a transformer, excitation voltages changes will cause directly proportional changes to the output (transformation ratio). However, the voltage out to excitation voltage ratio will remain constant. Since most RVDT signal conditioning systems measure signal as a function of the transformation ratio (TR), excitation voltage drift beyond 7.5% typically has no effect on sensor accuracy and strict voltage regulation is not typically necessary. Excitation frequency should be controlled within ±1% to maintain accuracy ...|$|E

40|$|Partial {{discharges}} (PD) that {{originate from}} dielectrically defective {{parts of the}} insulation system result in its degradation, which may ultimately lead to a failure of high voltage apparatus. This has resulted in development of numerous PD measuring techniques. One of the most widespread applications of PD measurement is in rotating machines. PD measurements in rotating machines unfortunately suffer from common difficulties, such as noise rejection, attenuation of the PD signals in stator winding and calibration accuracy. This thesis presents work on {{development of a new}} technique as well as a new measuring system for on-line measurement and localisation of PD in large rotating machines. The technique, which is denoted InTech, has considerably improved the aforementioned difficulties. In this technique, inductive sensors are positioned on the upper stator bars, so that every <b>stator</b> <b>coil</b> is situated between two sensors. The measurement is then focused on individual stator coils. Treatment of the sensor signals results in a measurement of the PD level in the <b>stator</b> <b>coil.</b> Thus, the <b>stator</b> <b>coil</b> from which the PD originates is also identified. The measuring system is controlled by a computer and the measurement values are documented for future usage during insulation condition control. InTech was primarily developed and tested in the laboratory using a pilot generator, and afterwards it was installed with good results on large power generators operating at power stations. The detection sensitivity of the measuring system for conventional rotating machines in service conditions is about 1 nC. In addition, a complete measuring system has also been installed since August 1998 on a Powerformer TM, a new type of high voltage generator based on a cable winding. Here the system has been used for monitoring eventual PD activity in the cable joints. One of the features utilised is remote access to the system using a telephone link or a data network...|$|E

40|$|OVERVIEW: To {{protect the}} global environment, current power {{generators}} must be highly efficient {{and must be}} able to minimize waste over long-term operation. With these circumstances in mind, Hitachi evaluated the reliability of a 250 -MVA class large-capacity air-cooled generator. In this evaluation, an air-cooled generator and a large-capacity load machine were electrically connected and a rated field current was applied to reproduce field conditions. Temperature distribution in the coil slot and the coil-end was then evaluated. It was found that the stator-coil temperature rise at the specified measured points between the top and bottom coils stayed within the limitation of B class insulation; in other words, the maximum temperature of the <b>stator</b> <b>coil</b> strand was well within the permissible temperature range. Hitachi has also developed a new insulation system using “low-environmental burden epoxy resin ” for the <b>stator</b> <b>coil,</b> a key component affecting generator performance. This epoxy resin has been achieved by adding a latent curing catalyst to constituent materials making for a pot life about six times longer than that of conventional products and less environmental load by reducing resin waste. The performance of this new insulation system was evaluated by various tests including a voltage-endurance test, a thermal-degradation test, and a thermal cycle test. These tests demonstrated the superior performance of the system and its contribution to long-term generator reliability...|$|E

However, the design of the segmented <b>stator</b> <b>coils</b> has negative repercussions on the material and production costs.

40|$|The {{project is}} a circuit that will {{basically}} supply current from the battery to the different <b>stator</b> <b>coils</b> at opportune moments. With a hall-effect sensor on the shaft as a feedback to a microcontroller, I was able to toggle switches based on {{the position of the}} shaft at the moments where we would be using as little power as possible. The operation of the control circuit works similar to a stepper motor; it takes a signal from the microcontroller that is sent to some FET drivers, which in turn sends signals to the FETs to open or close as the shaft is rotating. Since the <b>stator</b> <b>coils</b> are set at a certain angle apart from each other, it was an advantage to know where the starting point was, and extrapolate where every other magnet was with respect to the coils by putting the hall-effect sensor in line with one set of permanent magnets. This way, current was only sent to the <b>stator</b> <b>coils</b> when it was necessary to turn the motor. The idea was that we could conserve power by drawing from the battery less often, but made little progress in the final testing stages in conjunction with the motor.
