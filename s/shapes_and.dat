40|$|<b>Shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern and {{self-evaluation}} {{almost exclusively}} in these terms is a core feature of eating disorder psychopathology {{and it is this}} which is thought to drive weight control behaviours. The literature indicates concerns about weight <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> can be present in children at least as young as eight rears of age. Currently, there is no tool available which measures a child's over-concern with their body <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight per se. This study developed an assessment of children's body <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern, using scales measuring <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight concern and perceived importance of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight. The properties of the new <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern assessment were examined in relation to children's self-perception and implicit attitudes towards overweight. Participants were 333 Year 5 children (181 boys and 152 girls) from North Yorkshire primary schools, {{with a mean age of}} 9 years 7 months. They completed measures of body shape perception, dietary restraint, height and weight accuracy, self-esteem <b>and</b> body <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern. In addition they completed a timed implicit association task which assessed implicit attitudes towards overweight. The new assessment was concluded to have good psychometric properties and to be a reasonable assessment of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern in children. Children with high <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight concern tended to be heavier, less satisfied with their weight <b>and</b> body <b>shape,</b> have lower self-esteem and report increased levels of dietary restraint. High levels of perceived importance of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight also impacted on this latter variable. A general anti-fat bias was indicated from this group of children. Dietary restraint score was a significant predictor of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern, as was global self-worth (for the boys) and physical appearance (for the girls). No gender differences were found in the assessment of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern. This study is the first to measure <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern in children and highlights a need of continued research of over-concern in children and adults. This will continue to inform intervention and prevention programmes of eating disorders. Further research into the implicit anti-fat attitudes in children as young as 9 years is also indicated, especially in respect of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> weight over-concern...|$|R

40|$|Size <b>and</b> <b>shape,</b> {{although}} intuitively simple concepts, {{are difficult}} to define mathematically in a biologically meaningful way. Darroch and Mosimann (1985, Biometrika, 72 : 241 - 252) have proposed definitions of size <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> that incorporate the concept of geometric similarity, and have developed principal components of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> total variability in shape based on these definitions. We adopt these definitions of size <b>and</b> <b>shape.</b> Using a related definition of the principal components of shape, we characterize the dependence on the size variable of the principal components of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> total variability in shape. We derive the minimum amount of variability in <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> the corresponding size variable. The practical implications of these results are explored using data on strongylid eggs; for each of several plausible size variables, we determine the variability in <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> the principal components of shape. The amount of variability in <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> the principal components of shape are seen {{to be sensitive to}} the choice of size variable...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: When {{examining}} the <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color {{for a new}} product in an initial process of industrial design, they should be suitable for the product’s functionality, targeted image and concept. Additionally, it is also important that the <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color differ from those of existing products so that the new design is distinctive to attract consumer attention. To support designers in their endeavor to come up with new designs, we propose a computerized method of analyzing existing designs and searching for a possible usage of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color different from the existing designs. First, we mathematically define feature indices to represent <b>and</b> quantify <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color characteristics of designs. Then, we analyze the usage of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color in existing designs, which are obtained as 3 D CAD data or 3 D shape data scanned from real products, by calculating the feature indices of the designs. By plotting the calculated results as a vector in <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color feature indices space, we obtain the distribution of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color usages of the existing designs. Here, we assume that the distance between the two vectors in the space represents the difference in <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color usages of the two designs. Based on the assumption, we search for a possible new <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color usage by searching for a new vector in the space which is as far from any of the existing vectors as possible. Once such a new vector is obtained, we visualize the suggested usage of <b>shape</b> <b>and</b> color by generating 3 D polygon model examples with the feature indices quantified by the vector. We examine the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed idea by implementing it as a computer program and applying it to designs of &quot;card stands &quot; as simple actual product examples...|$|R
