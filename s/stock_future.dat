60|$|The {{mention of}} {{quotations}} puts me {{in mind of}} commonplace books, which have been long in use by industrious young divines, and I hear do still continue so. I know they are very beneficial to lawyers and physicians, because they are collections of facts or cases, whereupon {{a great part of}} their several faculties depend; of these I have seen several, but never yet any written by a clergyman; only from what I am informed, they generally are extracts of theological and moral sentences drawn from ecclesiastical and other authors, reduced under proper heads, usually begun, and perhaps finished, while the collectors were young in the church, as being intended for materials or nurseries to <b>stock</b> <b>future</b> sermons. You will observe the wise editors of ancient authors, when they meet a sentence worthy of being distinguished, take special care to have the first word printed in capital letters, that you may not overlook it: Such, for example, as the INCONSTANCY of FORTUNE, the GOODNESS of PEACE, the EXCELLENCY of WISDOM, the CERTAINTY of DEATH: that PROSPERITY makes men INSOLENT, and ADVERSITY HUMBLE; and the like eternal truths, which every ploughman knows well enough before Aristotle or Plato were born.[9] If theological commonplace books be no better filled, I think they had better be laid aside, and I could wish that men of tolerable intellectuals would rather trust their own natural reason, improved by a general conversation with books, to enlarge on points which they are supposed already to understand. If a rational man reads an excellent author with just application, he shall find himself extremely improved, and perhaps insensibly led to imitate that author's perfections, although in a little time he should not remember one word in the book, nor even the subject it handled: for books give the same turn to our thoughts and way of reasoning, that good and ill company do to our behaviour and conversation; without either loading our memories, or making us even sensible of the change. And particularly I have observed in preaching, that no men succeed better than those who trust entirely to the stock or fund of their own reason, advanced indeed, but not overlaid by commerce with books. Whoever only reads in order to transcribe wise and shining remarks, without entering into the genius and spirit of the author, as it is probable he will make no very judicious extract, so he will be apt to trust to that collection in all his compositions, and be misled out of the regular way of thinking, in order to introduce those materials, which he has been at the pains to gather and the product of all this will be found a manifest incoherent piece of patchwork.|$|E

40|$|<b>Stock</b> <b>futures</b> offer {{leveraged}} {{positions and}} are expected to attract informed traders. However, many researchers have found that the information share of the <b>stock</b> <b>futures</b> is surprisingly small; the equity spot market appears to play a large role in price discovery.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} the intraday price lead-lag relationship between TFEX Index future, single <b>stock</b> <b>future</b> and their underlying cash indices using ten-minute data. Candidate series being traded within TFEX are chosen based on liquidity criteria. Engle-Granger Cointegration {{is applied to}} explain bivariate long-run relationship and the Threshold Vector Error Correction Model is practiced to estimate the short-run adjustment parameters. A portfolio is afterward constructed {{on the basis of}} pair trading strategy to evaluate the performance of the model and predictability power. Also an alternation of weight ratios putting on the investment of future and cash is done {{to reduce the risk of}} wrong positioning. The result suggests that single <b>stock</b> <b>future</b> price movements lead its cash price while the causal relationship between SET 50 future and its Index is bi-directional with eventual lead of future price. Arbitrage opportunities present in SET 50 future derivative market and have strong impact on the dynamics. Besides, short run trading strategy fails in single <b>stock</b> <b>future</b> market due to low variability in the stock cash price and short-selling restriction. Investment ratio of 70 : 30 in future and cash perform best in SET 50 market and the 100 : 0 ratios minimize the loss in single stock market...|$|E

40|$|The study {{examined}} the effect of investor sentiment on future returns in the Nigerian stock market. The OLS regression and granger causality techniques were employed for data analyses. The results showed that (1) investor sentiment has a significant positive effect on stock market returns even after control for fundamentals such as Industrial production index, consumer price index and Treasury bill rate; (2) there is a uni-directional causality that runs from change in investor sentiment (ΔCCI) to stock market returns (Rm). Derived finding showed that the inclusion of fundamentals increased the explanatory power of investor sentiment from 3. 96 % to 33. 05 %, though at both level, investor sentiment (ΔCCI) has low explanatory power on stock market returns.

40|$|MBA - WBS"JSE tops all single stock {{futures market}}s" (Business Report, July 13, 2007). The Johannesburg Securities Exchange's (JSE) single stock futures {{market is the}} largest in the world. This {{research}} investigates the forecasting abilities of implied volatility models for South African single <b>stock</b> <b>future</b> options and warrants. Furthermore, the pricing premiums between the two derivative instruments are investigated, as this presents a potential arbitrage opportunity for the market makers of the warrants. Historical volatiity is used as a comparative forecast method to the implied models. The calculated historical and implied volatilities are compared retrospectively to the realised volatility to ascertain which forecasting methodology is superior. Inter-bank implied volatility for single stock futures options is compared to implied volatility for warrants with the same underlying shares to determine pricing premiums. The simple historical volatility model is shown to be a better forecast of realised volatility for both derivatives. Warrants are charged at a significantly higher premium than what the market makers, amongst themselves, {{are willing to pay for}} the same underlying shares with single stock futures options...|$|E
40|$|The use of commodity, {{currency}} and stock index futures to hedge risky exposures in {{the underlying assets}} is well documented in financial literature. However single stock futures are a relatively new addition {{to the family of}} futures and as such, academic research on its use as a hedging tool is relatively thin. In this study we have explored the efficacy of two different methodological approaches that may be applied when hedging a long position in the underlying stock with a single <b>stock</b> <b>future.</b> We use daily trading data covering years 2002 to 2007 from the Indian market, where single stock futures have been really thriving in terms of volume of trade, to extract the optimal hedge ratios using both static OLS as well as 30 -day, 60 -day and 90 -day moving least squares. The method of moving least squares has been in use by market practitioners for some time primarily as a trend analysis and charting tool. Our results indicate that the moving least squares approach outperforms the static OLS in terms of the hedging efficiency, which has been measured by the root mean square hedging error. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Urban building-stocks must be {{transformed}} {{in order to}} reduce energy and resource use to achieve climate change mitigation targets. As the rate of renewal in the building-stock is low, energy efficiency measures need to be applied when renovation is being done. In order to evaluate renovation potential of the existing building stock on an urban level, a local approach is needed to understand challenges and possibilities associated with the transformation of the building-stock. By incorporating building-specific information and also considering the building in its setting, a more holistic view can be achieved. For this purpose, available databases containing building-specific information has been gathered and processed for the multi-family building stock of the city of Gothenburg. The available data is used to describe the energy performance of the <b>stock,</b> <b>future</b> renovation needs and is used to create a description of the stock used as input for calculating the energy demand. This thesis with appended papers shows that available data sources can be used to describe the characteristics of the stock on a building level while considering the location and context. Building attributes such as year of construction, value year, property owner, geometric data and energy performance certificates is spatially linked as well as used in modelling the energy performance of buildings to provide detailed and valuable information to policy makers, urban planners and property owners...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects on {{consumers}} of an extreme policy experiment [...] Napsterizing' pharmaceuticals [...] whereby all patent rights on branded prescription drugs are eliminated for both existing and future prescription drugs without compensation to the patent holders. The question of whether this policy maximizes consumer welfare cannot be resolved on an a priori basis due to an obvious tradeoff: While accelerating generic entry will yield substantial gains in consumer surplus associated with greater access to the current stock of pharmaceuticals, future consumers will be harmed by reducing the flow of new pharmaceuticals to the market. Our estimates of the consumer surpluses at stake {{are based on the}} stylized facts concerning how generic entry has affected prices, outputs, and market shares. We find that providing greater access to the current stock of prescription drugs yields large benefits to existing consumers. However, realizing those benefits has a substantially greater cost in terms of lost consumer benefits from reductions in the flow of new drugs. Specifically, the model yields the result that for every dollar in consumer benefit realized from providing greater access to the current <b>stock,</b> <b>future</b> consumers would be harmed at a rate of three dollars in present value terms from reduced future innovation. We obtain this result even accounting for the stylized fact that after generic entry branded drugs continue to earn significant price premia over generic products and hence recognizing that Napsterizing does not completely eliminate the incentives to innovate. ...|$|E
