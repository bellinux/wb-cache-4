50|$|The S tube should swing over {{rapidly and}} not suffer undue wear. This is {{effected}} with two large-sized plunger cylinders and a so-called <b>spectacle</b> <b>plate</b> (so named from its shape) including seal rings.|$|E
5000|$|The builder's {{picture of}} the {{locomotive}} shows it without a cab and with only a <b>spectacle</b> <b>plate</b> for crew protection, but in photographs of the locomotives in service, they have cab roofs installed underneath the overhead condensing coils.|$|E
50|$|The first {{locomotives}} {{had just}} a <b>spectacle</b> <b>plate</b> to give {{protection for the}} crew, but then small cabs, open at the back, were fitted. Later {{on most of the}} surviving locomotives were given full cabs so that there was protection when running in reverse.|$|E
50|$|Their {{feedwater}} pumps, {{attached to}} the right hand side of their <b>spectacle</b> <b>plates,</b> were actuated from the piston crossheads. The locomotives were also each equipped with a small feedwater injector feed, {{attached to the}} left side of the smokebox, for use in cases of emergency or while the locomotives were stationary. The injector had been invented by the French engineer Henri Giffard in 1852.|$|R
500|$|During {{the brief}} time they {{operated}} under the Southern Railway, further modifications {{were applied to}} the class, such as the reduction in boiler pressure to [...] and the redesign of the footplate <b>spectacle</b> <b>plates.</b> These are the small windows on the front face of the cab, which were redesigned to a wedge-shaped profile, a feature to be seen on all Bulleid-designed locomotives post-nationalisation. [...] They had been introduced in Britain in 1934 with the Gresley-designed Cock o' the North. Originally, the <b>spectacle</b> <b>plates</b> of the Bulleid Pacifics were at the conventional right-angle to {{the direction of the}} locomotive, and offered limited vision ahead along the air-smoothed casing. The Southern-built batches also had variations in the material used for the air-smoothed casing with a change from sheet steel to an asbestos compound, forced upon the manufacturer by wartime expediency. [...] This resulted in several class members having a horizontal strengthening rib running {{down the length of the}} casing. The final Southern Railway-initiated experiment involved equipping 21C5 Canadian Pacific with a Berkeley mechanical stoker imported from Canada. [...] Little improvement in performance was seen when trialled under British Railways auspices in 1948 and the locomotive was re-converted to hand-firing.|$|R
500|$|To ease {{maintenance}} and lubrication, panels of air-smoothed casing {{ahead of the}} cylinders were removed from 1952, and the front sanders were blanked off. This coincided with {{the removal of the}} tender [...] "raves" [...] on all but five locomotives, as they obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker and restricted the driver's view when reversing. The resultant [...] "cut-down" [...] tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons and glass <b>spectacle</b> <b>plates</b> to protect the crew from flying coal dust when running tender-first.|$|R
50|$|In {{cross section}} the S-tube is {{circular}} with a diameter which tapers {{in the direction}} of flow. This keeps the risk of clogging down. The sealing faces of the <b>spectacle</b> <b>plate</b> and of the seal ring lie parallel with the swivelling movement of the S-tube, so that they cannot be damaged when foreign bodies are cut through or get stuck.|$|E
50|$|The locomotive's {{cylinders}} were mounted {{outside the}} frame and were lubricated by gravitation from two tallow cups, attached to the smokebox sides immediately above the steam chests. The feedwater pumps, attached {{to the back of}} the <b>spectacle</b> <b>plate,</b> were operated from the piston crossheads. The locomotive used wooden brake blocks which were driver-operated by a hand brake in the cab.|$|E
50|$|The {{feedwater}} pump, {{attached to}} the right hand side of the <b>spectacle</b> <b>plate,</b> was actuated from the piston crosshead. The locomotive was, in addition, equipped with a small feedwater injector feed {{attached to the}} left side of the smokebox, for use in cases of emergency or while the locomotive was stationary. The injector had been invented by the French engineer Henri Giffard in 1852.|$|E
5|$|As mentioned, the British Railways batch had detail {{differences}} to previous versions. The most significant modification was {{the reduction of}} weight using lighter materials unavailable during wartime. From 1952 the air-smoothed casing ahead of the cylinders was removed to ease maintenance and lubrication. This coincided with {{the removal of the}} tender 'raves' on all locomotives, as they obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker and restricted the driver's view when reversing the locomotive. The resultant 'cut-down' tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons, revised step ladders and glass <b>spectacle</b> <b>plates</b> to protect the crew from flying coal dust when running tender-first.|$|R
500|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, they were {{fitted with a}} new design of cab front <b>spectacle</b> <b>plates</b> from mid1947 due to poor forward visibility. The small windows on the front face of the cab were {{redesigned}} to an angled profile, giving improved visibility to the driver. This was a feature fitted to all Bulleid-designed locomotives post-nationalisation. They were introduced in Britain in 1934 with the Gresley-designed Cock o' the North. Over the next decade the revised design was fitted to existing members of the class. Another modification was the reduction of boiler pressure to [...] to reduce maintenance costs.|$|R

50|$|The large {{cross section}} of the holes in the <b>spectacle</b> <b>plate</b> means that with a {{delivery}} cylinder diameter of e.g. 200 mm it is possible to pump high-density solids with a mean grain size of as much as 80 mm. The maximum diameter of individual foreign bodies may be as high as 60% of the diameter of the delivery line - in this example this would be 120 mm.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was built}} and delivered by Manning Wardle and Company in 1902, with works number 1583. Named Midget, it was designated Type C and numbered 41 on the Cape Government Railways (CGR). The locomotive was delivered {{with an open}} cab, roofed, but not enclosed. To offer better protection to the crew, a <b>spectacle</b> <b>plate</b> and enclosed sides were added at some point soon after it entered service.|$|E
5000|$|The 4-4-0 tank {{locomotives}} {{delivered in}} 1864 had 16 x 20 in cylinders, 5 ft diameter driving wheels and weighed 42 ton 3 cwt in working order. The boiler pressure was , {{the front wheels}} were on a Bissel truck and fitted with [...] bunker. As they were intended for an underground railway, the locomotives did not have cabs, just a simple <b>spectacle</b> <b>plate.</b> To reduce smoke underground, at first coke was burnt, changed in 1869 to smokeless Welsh coal.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, they were {{fitted with a}} new design of cab front <b>spectacle</b> <b>plates</b> from mid - 1947 due to poor forward visibility.

50|$|Polar Bear was {{an updated}} and more {{powerful}} version of Sea Lion incorporating a number of modifications. Some of these such as the change from Baguley's modified valve gear to Bagnall Price gear can be put down to changes in key personnel at W.G Bagnall's but others such as the larger diameter cylinders, increased grate area and increased driving wheel diameter were probably specified in light of 9 years experience with Sea Lion in service. The most obvious visible {{difference between the two}} locomotives of course is the change from round to rectangular <b>spectacle</b> <b>plates</b> in the front cab sheet which improved the forward vision for the driver.|$|R
500|$|The Kclass design used a [...] "Bissel bogie" [...] {{leading axle}} and a plain {{trailing}} bogie. The trailing bogie permitted {{the use of}} a large coal bunker that was capable of sustaining the locomotive over the run between London Charing Cross and , and side water tanks of [...] capacity were used, negating the need for a tender. The coupled wheelbase between the rear and centre driving wheels was reduced from that used on the mechanically identical Nclass to [...] to accommodate the bogie. The cab was fully enclosed, although the set of four small front <b>spectacle</b> <b>plates</b> (the windows on the front face of the cab for forward visibility) were the same as those used on the Nclass.|$|R
5000|$|Edward the Blue Engine, {{from the}} Thomas the Tank Engine books, is {{described}} as bearing [...] "a quite striking similarity" [...] to the Furness 'Larger Seagulls'. The Edwardian 4-4-0 type is a fairly common design pattern in British steam locomotives. However Edward differs in having a cab with dual glazed side windows, a much more characteristic feature of North Eastern railway locomotives. The tapered non-circular <b>spectacle</b> <b>plate</b> windows and the higher boiler line are distinctively those of the NER Class R1.|$|E
5000|$|The third {{locomotive}} {{to enter}} service at Table Bay Harbour, the 0-4-0 side-tank engine {{which is the}} subject of this page, was obtained from Fletcher, Jennings & Co. in 1874. Apart from the photograph, not much is known about the locomotive, which had a cab roof with a <b>spectacle</b> <b>plate</b> front weatherboard to offer the crew some protection from the elements. In Harbour Board minutes at the time, one of the earlier two locomotives was now referred to as the [...] "spare locomotive".|$|E

The coupled wheelbase between the rear and centre driving wheels was reduced from that used on the mechanically identical N class to 7 ft to accommodate the bogie. The cab was fully enclosed, although the set of four small front <b>spectacle</b> <b>plates</b> (the windows on the front face of the cab for forward visibility) were the same as those used on the N class.|$|R
5|$|In {{common with}} the N, N1 and K class locomotives, the Midland Railway {{influence}} of Clayton showed in the placement of locomotive fittings on the production batch, as the water top-feed into the boiler was located inside a dome, whilst the cab area was {{a modified version of}} those on the 0-6-0s of Henry Fowler and the K class rebuilds. The rebuilds had Midland Railway-style double <b>spectacle</b> <b>plates</b> (the small windows on the front face of the cab) left over from the K class cabs, whereas the production versions had one each side of the boiler. Such modifications were becoming typical of the Southern Railway’s attempt to produce a fleet of standardised locomotives. However, all members of the U class were to vary from GWR practice, as the superheating surface area was increased, and all were equipped with outside Walschaerts valve gear.|$|R
5|$|The main design {{differences}} with the Nclass included the cab front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between the frames to drive the centre driving axle. Clayton had revised the layout of the cab front <b>spectacle</b> <b>plates</b> (small windows {{on the front of the}} cab) to improve forward visibility. This incorporated two large single panes of glass either side of the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the Nclass. The inside cylinder was to be actuated by Holcroft's design of conjugated valve gear, which consisted of mechanical links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear, eliminating the need for a separate set of valve gear between the frames to operate the inside cylinder. The result would be a reduction in weight and the amount of mechanical equipment located in this inaccessible part of the locomotive.|$|R
5000|$|Although Edward the Blue Engine, {{from the}} Thomas the Tank Engine books, is {{regularly}} described as bearing [...] "a quite striking similarity" [...] to the Furness Railway 'Larger Seagulls'., Edward is recognisable as an NER Class R1. The Edwardian 4-4-0 type {{is a fairly}} common design pattern in British steam locomotives, although {{at the time of}} the Seagulls they still had low-set small diameter boilers with tall chimneys. Edward, in particular, differs in having a cab with dual glazed side windows, a much more characteristic feature of North Eastern railway locomotives, the tapered non-circular <b>spectacle</b> <b>plate</b> windows and also the larger boiler diameter and higher boiler line are distinctively those of the NER R1, by then the LNER D21.|$|E
50|$|The {{signalling}} in {{the long}} and difficult tunnel section was conventional, using the Tyers Lock and Block system, but the signals themselves had no semaphore arms; instead they had a rising <b>spectacle</b> <b>plate</b> that exhibited the usual night time oil lamp colours to drivers. This subjected the Caledonian and its successor railway to criticism, as the smoky tunnel conditions, coupled with commonplace bunker-first running, led to difficulty for drivers. The intensive train service and the occasional failure of the lock and block system seems to have encouraged signalmen to adopt irregular practices {{to deal with the}} failures. The purpose of the lock and block system is to prevent signalmen from accepting a train until a preceding train has passed and the signals restored to danger. Collisions resulted from the irregular practice when a train failed in section and signalmen assumed that it had in fact had passed unnoticed, and irregularly released the system.|$|E
50|$|Sean Connery {{performed}} {{most of his}} own stunts in the film, {{including the}} extended sequence {{on top of the}} moving train. The train was composed of J-15 class 0-6-0 No 184 of 1880, with it's wheels and side rods covered and roof removed, leaving only <b>spectacle</b> <b>plate</b> for protection to give it a look more akin to the 1850s and coaches that were made for the movie from modern railway flat wagons. Connery was told that the train would travel at only 20 miles per hour during his time on top of the cars. However, the train crew used an inaccurate means of judging the train's speed. The train was actually doing speeds of 40 to 50 miles per hour. Connery wore soft rubber soled shoes and the roofs of the carriages were covered with a sandy, gritty surface. Connery actually slipped and nearly fell off the train during one jump between two carriages, and had difficulty keeping his eyes free of smoke and cinders from the locomotive.|$|E

25|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the design, as No. A890 {{featured}} right-hand drive, impeding forward vision for viewing signals from the footplate. The main batch was produced with left-hand drive to resolve this problem. The main batch could also be distinguished by their higher running plates along the sides of the boiler, compared to the lower version on the rebuild that required larger wheel splashers to cover the tops of the driving wheels. The main batch had also dispensed with the N class/Midland Railway-style double <b>spectacle</b> <b>plates</b> (the small windows on the front face of the cab) that was retained on the prototype, replacing them with one each side of the boiler. The production locomotives also had a flatter top to the dome covers than that seen on the rebuild. The cabside cutaways for driver visibility were also cut into the roof of A890, an arrangement reminiscent of the 2-cylinder U class rebuilds of K class locomotives.|$|R
