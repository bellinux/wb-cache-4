40|$|This article {{presents}} two questionnaire experiments that investigate the processing complexity {{of a variety}} of nested constructions in Japanese. The first experiment demonstrated that embedded structures containing a direct object NP in the most embedded clause were more complex than comparable nested structures that lacked an object NP in the most embedded clause. The second experiment demonstrated that a construction consisting of a relative clause embedded within a <b>sentential</b> <b>complement</b> is less complex than the reverse embedding, consisting of <b>sentential</b> <b>complement</b> embedded within a relative clause. These results are discussed in terms of the syntactic prediction locality theory (Gibson 1998). ...|$|E

After 3 training sessions, 3 -year-old children improved their false belief understanding both in a training condition involving perspective-shifting discourse about deceptive objects (without mental state terms) and in {{a condition in which}} <b>sentential</b> <b>complement</b> syntax was used (without deceptive objects). Children did not improve in a condition in which they were exposed to deceptive objects without accompanying language. Children showed most improvement in a condition using both perspective-shifting discourse and <b>sentential</b> <b>complement</b> syntax, suggesting that each of these types of linguistic experience plays an independent role in the ontogeny of false belief understanding...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{restrictions}} on the realization of <b>sentential</b> <b>complements</b> of nouns {{on the basis of}} the distribution očto-clauses in Russian. I propose an account for these restrictions in which <b>sentential</b> <b>complements</b> of nouns are introduced by a silent preposition necessitated by the structural Case requirement of <b>sentential</b> <b>complements.</b> The observed restrictions follow from the licensing conditions on predication imposed by the silent preposition, which, as I argue, is interpreted as a relation of possession (of propositional content). These licensing conditions are satisfied only in those environments where the complement-taking noun projects a (logophorically controlled) implicit argument, which can serve as the subject for predication. If the proposed account is correct, it provides evidence for the θ-theoretic (Visibility) approach to the Case Filter, which entails that sentential arguments require structural Case licensing...|$|R

Post-test results showed an improvement in children"s false belief understanding in the discourse and the labelling conditions, {{but not in the}} <b>sentential</b> <b>complements</b> with non-deceptive objects or the control group. Furthermore, the most remarkable improvement in false belief understanding occurred in the labelling group. These results suggest that some types of linguistic experience promote the development of false belief understanding, provided that differing perspectives are confronted...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the behaviour of <b>sentential</b> <b>complements</b> in Mohawk {{within the framework}} of Government and Binding Theory. Past proposals concerning the syntactic structure of <b>sentential</b> <b>complements</b> in Romance languages (and English) are explored in Mohawk. It is claimed that Mohawk only has full CP complements and no distinct types of embedded clauses (such as a subjunctive or infinitival). This is due to a morphological requirement (specified by the Minimal Word Constraint) on Mohawk verbs which dictates the need for obligatory agreement morphology. Tense/aspect co-occurrence restrictions are given to show what type of CP complements a verb can take. The evidence indicates that selection of complements is due to semantic and not syntactic reasons...|$|R
40|$|This paper employs {{empirical}} {{methods to}} examine verbs such as seem, {{for which the}} traditional raising to subject analysis relates pairs of sentences which differ by taking an infinitival or <b>sentential</b> <b>complement.</b> A corpus-driven investigation of the verbs seem and appear demonstrates that information structure and evidentiality both play a determinate role in the choice between infinitival or sentential complementation. The {{second half of the}} paper builds upon the corpus results and examines the implications for the standard claims concerning these constructions. First, pairs of sentences related by the subject-to-subject raising analysis of verbs are often viewed as equivalent. New evidence from indefinite generic subjects shows that whether an indefinite generic subject occurs in the infinitival or <b>sentential</b> <b>complement</b> construction leads to truth-conditional differences. Further implications are explored for the claim that subjects of the infinitival variant may take narrow-scope: once various confounds are controlled for, the subject of the infinitival construction is shown to most naturally take wide-scope...|$|E
40|$|Complement clauses in German {{can have}} a lexical complementizer when they are finite, but they must not have one when they are non-finite.

The status marker zu in German infinitival complements can be shown to block reference. Thus, non-finite complement clauses with zu do not project a left periphery and cannot host a complementizer...|$|E

The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore sluicing in Persian as a real wh-in-situe language that displays optional wh-movement, with a special focus on multiple sluicing. Built on focus movement analysis rather than wh-movement, we examined the movement-plus-deletion approach and the role of focus fronting in moving the remnant out of the deleted constituent in Persian sluicing to a position where it can be stranded.

40|$|The {{acquisition}} of Mental State Verbs (MSVs) has been exten-sively studied {{in respect to}} their common occurrence with sen-tential complement syntax. However, MSVs also occur in a va-riety of other syntactic structures. Moreover, other verb classes frequently occur with <b>sentential</b> <b>complements,</b> e. g., Communi-cation and Perception verbs. The similarity in distribution of the various verb classes over syntactic patterns may affect the {{acquisition of}} the meaning of MSVs by association. In this study we present a novel computational model to learn verb classes, which allows us to analyze the association of men-tal verbs to their meaning over a variety of syntactic patterns. Our results point to an important role of the full syntactic pref-erences of MSVs on top of their occurrences with <b>sentential</b> <b>complements...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} different semantic and syntactic aspects of sentential complementation in the Romance languages. A general theory of sentential complementation is developed to account both for the numerous syntactic differences found among {{the different types of}} <b>sentential</b> <b>complements</b> and for the selectional properties of the semantic classes of main predicates that select these complements. In chapter 1, a semantic classification of main predicates is ii,lroduced. Three main classes of predicates are distinguished: effective, emotive and propositional predicates. The major leading hypothesis of this dissertation is also introduced in that chapter. It is argued that the three semantic classes of predicates s-select distinct semantic types of <b>sentential</b> <b>complements</b> which also correspond to distinct structural types of complements.

40|$|Hinuq and Bezhta, two {{languages}} of the Tsezic sub-group of the Nakh-Daghestanian (East Caucasian) language family, have General noun modifying clause constructions (GNMCCs), which {{have also been}} noted in some other Nakh-Daghestanian languages. While readily acceptable and interpretable, GNMCCs that do not receive an interpretation with a coreferential element in the modifying clause are rare in natural discourse, certainly in comparison with Japanese, {{and the range of}} types also seems more restricted. We speculate that this is because Japanese by and large lacks <b>sentential</b> <b>complement</b> structures independent of GNMCCs, and moreover because Hinuq and Bezhta do not have highly frequent GNMCCs with light nouns, whose presence in Japanese serves to make GNMCCs a much more salient feature of discourse...|$|E
40|$|We present {{empirical}} data {{showing that the}} relative frequency with which a verb normally appears in a syntactic construction predicts young children's ability to remember and repeat sentences instantiating that construction. Children aged 2; 10 – 5; 8 years were asked to repeat grammatical and ungrammatical <b>sentential</b> <b>complement</b> sentences (e. g., ‘I think + S’). The sentences contained complement-taking verbs (CTVs) used with differing frequencies in children's natural speech. All children repeated sentences containing high frequency CTVs (e. g., think) more accurately than those containing low frequency CTVs (e. g., hear), and made more sophisticated corrections to ungrammatical sentences containing high frequency CTVs. The data suggest that, like adults, children are sensitive to lexico-constructional collocations. The implications for language acquisition are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} split CP {{analysis}} in Rizzi (1997) to <b>sentential</b> <b>complements</b> in Romanian. Empirical {{data indicate that}} declarative sentences exhibit a reduced CP complement that qualifies as FinP. The head Fin displays lexical checkers at all times (i. e., either lexical complementizers or mood markers moved to Fin). Left dislocation to Topic and Focus is clause internal, following but not preceding the lexical material in Fin. On the other hand, indirect interrogatives and wh-interrogatives project to ForceP and display a complex CP field. The proposal based on these observations is that cross-linguistic variation may arise w. r. t. {{the complexity of the}} CP field because in some languages the presence versus the absence of a Force head is sufficient to mark a distinctive opposition between marked (e. g., interrogative, exclamative, conditional, etc.) and non-marked (e. g., declarative) <b>sentential</b> <b>complements.</b> * The split CP hypothesis proposed in Rizzi (1997) organizes th...|$|R

40|$|This study about error types is {{conducted}} particularly {{to focus on}} the types of grammatical errors and surface changes that occur in English compositions. The importance of investigating error types is to show the correct grammatical rules, which might result in a good writing. The data were taken from fifteen writing compositions written by eleven high-level students of EF English First in Plaza Surabaya, ranging from level 13 up to 16. By discovering the students? errors in writing their compositions, the writer attempts to find out the types of errors based on linguistic categories and surface strategies; besides revealing the committed type of errors along with the frequency of each occurrence. The errors collected are classified according to the linguistic category proposed by Burt and Kiparsky (1972). In addition, she employs the theories written by Dulay, Burt and Krashen (1982) namely Surface Strategy Taxonomy for the data explanation. The results of the analysis show that the noun phrase errors gain the highest percentage, while <b>sentential</b> <b>complement</b> errors get the lowest percentage in the data. It is significant to note that verb phrase errors also take a dominant percentage in the compositions. The findings above might suggest that most EF students have difficulties in the application of English grammar, whereas they {{seem to be able to}} use the rule of <b>sentential</b> <b>complement</b> in writing a composition. In addition, the highest percentage of surface strategies goes to misformation errors and the least error belongs to misordering ones. The findings show that the students do not know the application of a certain rule so they might misform the forms. In short, based on the research that the writer has done, it turns out that English proficiency levels do not guarantee one?s mastery of English grammar...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There {{are three}} ways {{to refer to}} a fact from the {{complement}} of a factive verb: 1) via abstract object anaphoric reference, or, with a full <b>sentential</b> <b>complement</b> that will be interpreted either 2) as a bound presupposition or 3) as triggering a presupposition of a fact {{that will have to be}} accommodated. Spoken corpus examples reveal that these three possibilities differ in relation to the type of information they tend to contribute, and this has two effects. First, the information status of the fact and its role in the discourse seem to affect the preference for one construction over another in a particular context. Second, presupposed factive complements that need to be accommodated tend to be hearer-new and the focus of the utterance, meaning that information structure seems to contribute to the felicity of accommodation of presupposed facts...|$|E

40|$|Intensionality {{phenomena}} {{were first}} discussed by Frege (1893) {{in the context}} of <b>sentential</b> <b>complement</b> constructions like (1 a,b). Frege noted that substitution of co-referring terms in clausal complements needn’t preserve truth (1 a,b). 1 Another feature of these environments is that the presence of a nonreferring or nondenoting term needn’t yield a false sentence (2 a). Furthermore, an indefinite in such an environment can be read nonspecifically; thus in (2 b), Max can believe a famous actor to be in the movie without there being any particular famous actor such that Max believes he or she was in the movie: (1) a. Max believed [CP [NP Boris Karloff] was in the movie]. b. Max believed [CP [NP Bill Pratt] was in the movie]. (2) a. Max believed [CP [NP a werewolf] was in the movie]. b. Max believed [CP [NP a famous actor] was in the movie]. Intensionality effects are not standardly observed with non-clausal complements.

40|$|Readers are {{sensitive}} to the fact that verbs may allow multiple subcategorization frames that differ in their probability of occurrence. Although a verbÕs overall subcategorization preferences can be described probabilistically, underlying non-random factors may determine those probabilities. One potential factor is verb semantics: Many verbs show sense differences, and a verbÕs subcategorization profile can vary by sense. Thus, although find can occur with a direct object (DO) or a <b>sentential</b> <b>complement</b> (SC), when it is used to mean ÔlocateÕ it occurs only with a DO, whereas in its ÔrealizeÕ sense it is SC-biased, but can take either frame. We used corpus analyses to identify verbs that occur with both frames, and found that their subcategorization probabilities differ by sense. Off-line sentence completions demonstrated that contexts can promote a specific sense of a verb, which subsequently influenced subcategorization probability. Finally, in a self-paced reading time experiment, verbs occurred in target sentences containing either a structurally unambiguous or ambiguous SC, following a context favoring the verbÕs DO- or SC-biased sense. Sensebiasing context influenced reading times at that, and interacted with ambiguity in the disambiguating region. Thus, readers use sense-contingent subcategorization preferences during on-line language comprehension...|$|E

Sklavounou, 1997) we have singled out constructions with specific syntactic properties and related them to lexical entries of different syntactic classes. In this article we study the specific syntactic properties of the adjectival constructions whose subject is a sentence or a deverbal phrase, for example Η απόφαση του Οδυσσέα ήταν έξυπνη (Ulysses' decision was clever). These constructions {{are related to the}} construction with a human subject and a <b>sentential</b> <b>complement</b> ΝΟ είναι Adj QueP. The two adjectival constructions (sentential or human subject) have important syntactic differences. Both can be nominalized leading to two de-adjectival nominal sentences, indirectly related, with slightly different meanings and different support verb. We propose a representation with two families of constructions inside the lexical entry : one for the human-subject construction and another for the sentential-subject one.

40|$|Two {{self-paced}} reading experiments investigated {{several factors}} that in-fluence the comprehension complexity of singly-embedded relative clauses (RCs) in English. Three factors were manipulated in Experiment 1, result-ing in three main e¤ects. First, object-extracted RCs were read {{more slowly than}} subject-extracted RCs, replicating previous work. Second, RCs that were embedded within the <b>sentential</b> <b>complement</b> of a noun were read more slowly than comparable RCs that were not embedded in this way. Third, and most interestingly, object-modifying RCs were read more slowly than subject-modifying relative clauses. This result contradicts {{one of the central}} tenets of complexity research: that nested sentences are harder to under-stand than their right-branching equivalents (e. g., Miller and Chomsky 1963). It is hypothesized that this result followed from a combination of two information-flow factors: (1) background information is usually pre-sented early in a sentence; and (2) restrictive RCs—the form of the RCs in Experiment 1 —usually convey background information. Experiment 2 tested this hypothesis by comparing restrictive and non-restrictive RCs— which generally provide new information—in both subject- and object-modifying positions. The results of the experiment were as predicted by the information-flow account: Only restrictive RCs were read more slowly when modifying objects. It is concluded that both resource and information-flow factors need to be considered in explaining RC complexity e¤ects...|$|E
40|$|Two main {{types of}} {{sentences}} are traditionally distinguished {{in the context}} of semantic theories of questions and answers: declarative sentences, corresponding to statements, and interrogative sentences, corresponding to questions. The interrogative forms can be fur- ther subdivided into dialectical ones (yes-no-questions) and non- dialectical ones (constituent questions). These distinctions are made for both root and embedded sentences. The predicates that select <b>sentential</b> <b>complements</b> fall into three classes: predicates that license only declaratives, those that allow only for interrogatives, and those that embed both types of sentences. In this connection, verbs of doubt are interesting in that they allow for declaratives as well as dialectical interrogatives, while non-dialectical interrogatives {{do not seem to be}} appropriate complements.
