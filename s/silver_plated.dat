5|$|In May 2007, YouTube {{launched}} its Partner Program, a {{system based on}} AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site. YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader. There are over a million members of the YouTube Partner Program. According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually no {{more than half of}} eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, {{due to a lack of}} interested advertisers. In 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos. YouTube Play Buttons, a part of the YouTube Creator Rewards, are a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels. The trophies made of nickel plated copper-nickel alloy, golden plated brass, <b>silver</b> <b>plated</b> metal and ruby are given to channels with at least one hundred thousand, a million, ten million and fifty million views, respectively.|$|E

60|$|If {{imperial}} Rome {{was beautiful}} in detail {{because it had}} the Greeks to imagine the things it so hideously grouped, ecclesiastical Rome may be unbeautiful in detail because it had not the Goths to realize the beauty of its religious aspiration--that is, {{if it was the}} Goths who invented Gothic architecture; I do not suppose it was. Anyway, there is said to be but one Gothic church in Rome, and this I did not visit, perhaps because I felt that I must inure myself to the prevalent baroque, or perhaps from mere perversity. I can merely say in self-defence that, on the outside, Santa Maria sopra Minerva no more promised an inner beauty than Il Gesu, which is the most baroque church in Rome, without the power of coming together for a unity of effect which baroque churches sometimes have. It is a tumult of virtuosity in painting, in sculpture, in architecture. Statues sprawl into frescoed figures at points in the roof, and frescoed figures emerge in marble at others. Marvels of riches are lavished upon chapels and altars, which again are so burdened with bronze gilded or <b>silver</b> <b>plated,</b> and precious stones wrought and unwrought, that the soul, or if not the soul the taste, shrinks dismayed from them. Execution in default of inspiration has had its way to the last excess; there is nothing that it has not done to show what it can do; and all that it has done is a triumph of misguided skill and power. But {{it would be a mistake}} for the spectator to imagine that anything has been done from the spirit in which he receives it; everything is the expression of devoted faith in the forms that the art of the time offered.|$|E

50|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>plating</b> {{is common}} on all brass {{mouthpieces}} {{because it is}} cost-effective and good in terms of tone quality. It is also moderately germicidal. <b>Silver</b> <b>plating</b> is not as comfortable or as expensive as gold, but has properties and qualities that some feel facilitate certain styles of playing. Some believe that <b>silver</b> <b>plate</b> provides a clearer, darker sound than gold and is good for styles of playing that require clarity and projection. Silver-plate is less expensive than gold, but requires more maintenance because it tarnishes easily. Slightly tarnished silver-plate can be polished back to its brightness with silver polish.|$|R

5000|$|One {{technique}} {{to improve the}} efficiency is to reduce amount of material that does not carry current by making the conductor of hollow tubing. The large surface area of the tube conducts the current with much less resistance than a solid wire with the same cross-sectional area would.

The cylinder of the revolver was designed with five individual chambers {{in the form of}} sliding tubes (lenght of the chambers 1.24 inch) within the cutouts of the cylinder. For removing spent cartridge cases and reloading, the chambers slide forward one at a time over an ejector-rod {{at the front of the}} cylinder, fixed on the right side parallel to the barrel.|$|E
