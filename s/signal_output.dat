25|$|A {{condenser}} microphone, {{also called}} a capacitor microphone or electrostatic microphone, is a microphone containing a capacitor that has two plates with a voltage between them. In the condenser microphone, {{one of these}} plates is made of very light material and acts as the diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates when struck by sound waves, changing {{the distance between the}} two plates and therefore changing the capacitance. Specifically, when the plates are closer together, capacitance increases and a charge current occurs. When the plates are further apart, capacitance decreases and a discharge current occurs. A voltage is required across the capacitor for this to work. This voltage is supplied either by a battery in the mic or by external phantom power. The condenser microphone was invented in 1916 at Bell Laboratories by Edward Christopher 'E.C.' Wente, which became possible {{with the advent of the}} vacuum tube (valve) to act as an amplifier of the low <b>signal</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
25|$|Commodore {{sold the}} C64 {{not only through}} its network of {{authorized}} dealers, but also through department stores, discount stores, toy stores and college bookstores. The C64 had a built-in RF modulator and thus could be plugged into any television set. This allowed it (like its predecessor, the VIC-20) to compete directly against video game consoles such as the Atari 2600. Like the Apple IIe, the C64 can also output a composite video signal (avoiding the RF modulator) that can be plugged into a specialized monitor for a sharper picture. Unlike the IIe, the C64's NTSC output capability also includes separate luminance/chroma <b>signal</b> <b>output</b> equivalent to (and electrically compatible with) S-Video, for connection to the Commodore 1702 monitor, providing even better video quality than a composite signal. Aggressive pricing of the C64 is considered {{to have been a}} major catalyst in the North American video game crash of 1983. In January 1983, Commodore offered a $100 rebate in the United States on the purchase of a C64 to anyone that traded in another video game console or computer. To take advantage of this rebate, some mail-order dealers and retailers offered a Timex Sinclair 1000 for as little as $10 with purchase of a C64, so the consumer could send the TS1000 to Commodore, collect the rebate, and pocket the difference; Timex Corporation departed the computer market within a year. Commodore's tactics soon led to a price war with the major home computer manufacturers. The success of the VIC-20 and C64 contributed significantly to the exit from the field of Texas Instruments and other smaller competitors.|$|E
500|$|The {{detected}} voltage <b>signal</b> <b>output</b> of the Schottky barrier diodes {{typically used}} in microwave detectors have a square law {{relationship to the}} power being measured and meters are calibrated accordingly. [...] However, as the power increases, the diode deviates significantly from a square law and remains accurate up to an output voltage of only around [...] [...] This can be improved a little by adding a load resistor to the detector output, but this also has the undesirable effect of decreasing sensitivity. [...] Another technique {{is to reduce the}} range of power being measured (so that it is brought within the square law range of the detector) by measuring at a point other than a maximum. [...] The maximum is then calculated from the known mathematical shape of the standing wave pattern. [...] This has the objection that it adds significantly to the labour required to make the measurements, as does the technique of precisely calibrating the detector and adjusting the readings on the meter according to a calibration chart.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{detection}} side {{there are many}} factors that can also affect signal intensity in a non-proportional way. The size of the ion will affect the velocity of impact and with certain detectors the velocity {{is proportional to the}} <b>signal</b> <b>output.</b> In other detection systems, such as FTICR, the number of charges on the ion are more important to signal intensity. In Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance and Orbitrap type mass spectrometers the signal intensity (Y-axis) is related to the amplitude of the free induction decay signal. This is fundamentally a power relationship (amplitude squared) but often computed as an [...] For decaying signals the rms is not equal to the average amplitude. Additionally the damping constant (decay rate of the signal in the fid) is not the same for all ions. In order to make conclusions about relative intensity a great deal of knowledge and care is required.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} imaging mode {{collects}} low-energy (<50 eV) secondary electrons that are {{ejected from the}} k-shell of the specimen atoms by inelastic scattering interactions with beam electrons. Due to their low energy, these electrons originate within a few nanometers from the sample surface. The electrons are detected by an Everhart-Thornley detector, which {{is a type of}} scintillator-photomultiplier system. The secondary electrons are first collected by attracting them towards an electrically biased grid at about +400 V, and then further accelerated towards a phosphor or scintillator positively biased to about +2,000 V. The accelerated secondary electrons are now sufficiently energetic to cause the scintillator to emit flashes of light (cathodoluminescence), which are conducted to a photomultiplier outside the SEM column via a light pipe and a window in the wall of the specimen chamber. The amplified electrical <b>signal</b> <b>output</b> by the photomultiplier is displayed as a two-dimensional intensity distribution that can be viewed and photographed on an analogue video display, or subjected to analog-to-digital conversion and displayed and saved as a digital image. This process relies on a raster-scanned primary beam. The brightness of the signal depends on the number of secondary electrons reaching the detector. If the beam enters the sample perpendicular to the surface, then the activated region is uniform about the axis of the beam and a certain number of electrons [...] "escape" [...] from within the sample. As the angle of incidence increases, the interaction volume increases and the [...] "escape" [...] distance of one side of the beam decreases, resulting in more secondary electrons being emitted from the sample. Thus steep surfaces and edges tend to be brighter than flat surfaces, which results in images with a well-defined, three-dimensional appearance. Using the signal of secondary electrons image resolution less than 0.5nbsp&nm is possible.|$|E

40|$|Cytokinins {{propagate}} signals via multiple phosphorelays in {{a mechanism}} similar to bacterial two-component systems. In Arabidopsis, <b>signal</b> <b>outputs</b> {{are determined by}} the activation state of transcription factors termed type-B Arabidopsis response regulators (ARRs); however, their regulatory mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the proteolysis of ARR 2, a type-B ARR, modulates cytokinin <b>signaling</b> <b>outputs.</b> ARR 2 -hemagglutinin (HA) is rapidly degraded by cytokinin treatment, but other type-B ARRs, such as ARR 1 -HA, ARR 10 -HA, ARR 12 -HA and ARR 18 -HA, are not. ARR 2 degradation is mediated by the 26 S proteasome pathway, and requires cytokinin-induced phosphorylation of Asp 80 residue in the receiver domain. Through mutational analysis of amino acid residues in the receiver domain, we found that substitution of Lys 90 with Gly inhibits ARR 2 degradation. ARR 2 K 90 G-HA in transgenic Arabidopsis conferred enhanced cytokinin sensitivity in various developmental processes, including primary root elongation, callus induction, leaf senescence and hypocotyl growth. ARR 2 K 90 G-HA increased the expression of type-A ARRs, primary cytokinin-responsive genes and indicators of <b>signaling</b> <b>output</b> in two-component circuits. Expression of ARR 2 K 90 G-HA from the native ARR 2 promoter in the arr 2 - 4 knock-out mutant also increased cytokinin sensitivity. In conclusion, ARR 2 proteolysis is involved in the maintenance of the primary <b>signaling</b> <b>output</b> for normal developmental processes mediated by cytokinin in Arabidopsis...|$|R
