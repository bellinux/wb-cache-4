5|$|After this, Baker {{appeared}} in the independent British-German film Station Six-Sahara (1962) {{as a woman who}} provokes tensions at an oil station in the Sahara Desert, as well as the blockbuster Western epic How the West Was Won (1962), opposite Debbie Reynolds and former co-stars Gregory Peck and Karl Malden. In addition to film acting, Baker also found time to appear again on Broadway, starring in the 1962 production of Garson Kanin's Come on Strong in the fall of that year. In 1963, Baker relocated permanently with then-husband Jack Garfein and their two children to Los Angeles, where she based herself for the next several years. She traveled to Kenya to film Mister Moses (1965), where publicized rumors spread that she and co-star Robert Mitchum were having an affair, which they both vehemently denied. Another <b>story,</b> <b>now</b> considered apocryphal, had it that a Maasai chief in Kenya offered 150 cows, 200 goats, sheep, and $750 for her hand in marriage. She subsequently appeared with Maasai warriors on the cover of Lifes July 1964 issue.|$|E

25|$|In New York City, Laurents went to {{the opening}} night party for a new play by Ugo Betti, and there he met Sondheim, who had heard that East Side <b>Story,</b> <b>now</b> retitled West Side Story, was back on track. Bernstein had decided he needed to {{concentrate}} solely on the music, and he and Robbins had invited Betty Comden and Adolph Green to write the lyrics, but the team opted to work on Peter Pan instead. Laurents asked Sondheim {{if he would be}} interested in tackling the task. Initially he resisted, because he was determined to write the full score for his next project (Saturday Night had been aborted), but Oscar Hammerstein convinced him that he would benefit from the experience, and he accepted. Meanwhile, Laurents had written a new draft of the book changing the characters' backgrounds: Anton, once an Irish American, was now of Polish and Irish descent, and the formerly Jewish Maria had become a Puerto Rican.|$|E

And the one overwhelming feature that the director's cut makes unforgettable are the many faces of the children, whether playing, singing, or cowering, much of the reaction to what happens on-screen is through the eyes, both innocent and imitative, of all the children.|$|E
500|$|In October 2013, it was {{revealed}} on-screen that Dylan {{is in fact the}} long-lost son of Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott). Scott had previously previewed her upcoming storyline in an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, stating: [...] "I love this <b>story!</b> <b>Now,</b> I don’t know how it’s all going to turn out, but the premise, the people I get to work with, and the writing, has been spectacular.

500|$|Grant often poked fun {{at himself}} with {{statements}} such as, [...] "Everyone {{wants to be}} Cary Grant—even I want to be Cary Grant", and in ad-lib lines—such as in the film His Girl Friday (1940), saying, [...] "Listen, the last man who {{said that to me}} was Archie Leach, just a week before he cut his throat." [...] In Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), a gravestone is seen bearing the name Archie Leach. According to a famous <b>story</b> <b>now</b> believed to be fictional, after seeing a telegram from a magazine editor to his agent asking, [...] "How old Cary Grant?", Grant reportedly responded, [...] "Old Cary Grant fine. How you?" [...] Despite his strong comedic qualities, Alfred Hitchcock thought that Grant was also very effective in playing darker roles, with a mysterious, dangerous quality, remarking that [...] "there is a frightening side to Cary that no one can quite put their finger on". Wansell notes that this darker, mysterious side extended to his personal life, which he took great lengths to cover up to retain his debonair image.|$|E

500|$|In 1947, {{the author}} {{submitted}} {{a short story}} titled simply [...] "The Bananafish" [...] to The New Yorker. [...] William Maxwell, the magazine's fiction editor, was impressed enough with [...] "the singular quality of the story" [...] that the magazine asked Salinger to continue revising it. He spent a year reworking it with New Yorker editors and the magazine accepted the <b>story,</b> <b>now</b> titled [...] "A Perfect Day for Bananafish", and published it in the January 31, 1948 issue. [...] The magazine thereon offered Salinger a [...] "first-look" [...] contract that allowed them {{right of first refusal}} on any future stories. The critical acclaim accorded [...] "Bananafish", coupled with problems Salinger had with stories being altered by the [...] "slicks", led him to publish almost exclusively in The New Yorker. [...] "Bananafish" [...] was also the first of Salinger's published stories to feature the Glasses, a fictional family consisting of two retired vaudeville performers and their seven precocious children: Seymour, Buddy, Boo Boo, Walt, Waker, Zooey, and Franny. Salinger eventually published seven stories about the Glasses, developing a detailed family history and focusing particularly on Seymour, the brilliant but troubled eldest child.|$|E
500|$|This {{interest}} in the 'Arthur of romance' and his associated stories continued through the 19th century and into the 20th, and influenced poets such as William Morris and Pre-Raphaelite artists including Edward Burne-Jones. [...] Even the humorous tale of Tom Thumb, which had been the primary manifestation of Arthur's legend in the 18th century, was rewritten {{after the publication of}} Idylls. While Tom maintained his small stature and remained a figure of comic relief, his <b>story</b> <b>now</b> included more elements from the medieval Arthurian romances and Arthur is treated more seriously and historically in these new versions. [...] The revived Arthurian romance also proved influential in the United States, with such books as Sidney Lanier's The Boy's King Arthur (1880) reaching wide audiences and providing inspiration for Mark Twain's satiric A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889). [...] Although the 'Arthur of romance' was sometimes central to these new Arthurian works (as he was in Burne-Jones's [...] "The Sleep of Arthur in Avalon", 1881-1898), on other occasions he reverted to his medieval status and is either marginalized or even missing entirely, with Wagner's Arthurian operas providing a notable instance of the latter. [...] Furthermore, the revival of {{interest in}} Arthur and the Arthurian tales did not continue unabated. [...] By the end of the 19th century, it was confined mainly to Pre-Raphaelite imitators, and it could not avoid being affected by World War I, which damaged the reputation of chivalry and thus interest in its medieval manifestations and Arthur as chivalric role model. The romance tradition did, however, remain sufficiently powerful to persuade Thomas Hardy, Laurence Binyon and John Masefield to compose Arthurian plays, and T. S. Eliot alludes to the Arthur myth (but not Arthur) in his poem The Waste Land, which mentions the Fisher King.|$|E
2500|$|In another interview, Marasigan said he {{was eating}} in SM Megamall, a local {{shopping}} mall, when he heard of the news.

Adoro told of the <b>story</b> <b>now</b> famous among Eraserheads fans about Buendia's cryptic text message. He said Buendia stated in the text message that he had already [...] "graduated." [...] Adoro quipped in the same interview that it was natural for Buendia to graduate first, since he was in batch '87 of their college (UP Diliman), while the rest were in batch '88.|$|E

2500|$|By 1993, it was announced, in Variety {{among other}} sources, that Lucas {{would be making}} the prequels. He began penning more to the <b>story,</b> <b>now</b> {{indicating}} the series would be a tragic one examining Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side. Lucas also began to change how the prequels would exist relative to the originals; at first {{they were supposed to}} be a [...] "filling-in" [...] of history tangential to the originals, but now he saw that they could form the beginning of one long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step towards turning the film series into a [...] "Saga". In 1994, Lucas began writing the screenplay to the first prequel, initially titled Episode I: The Beginning. Following the release of that film, Lucas announced that he would also be directing the next two, and began work on Episode II.|$|E
2500|$|These {{plans were}} revised and {{elaborated}} on again by April 1923. Now the memorial was to stand [...] high.

The second <b>story,</b> <b>now</b> [...] in size with a high ceiling and extensive windows (to let in large amounts of natural light), was still slated to house the Washington museum. The purpose of the third floor was not yet agreed upon. The tower above the third floor now contained an observation deck forming a seventh and ultimate floor {{at the top of the}} tower. The new plans specified that terraces would lead from the front steps of the memorial down to the street below. The cost, however, was still budgeted for $4 million.|$|E
2500|$|In late February 2006, the {{newspaper}} The Standard {{ran a story}} claiming that president Mwai Kibaki and senior opposition figure Kalonzo Musyoka had been holding secret meetings. On 2 March at 1:00am local time (2200 UTC on the 1st), masked gunmen carrying AK-47s raided multiple editorial offices of The Standard, and of its television station KTN. They kicked and beat staff members, forcibly took computers and transmission equipment, burned all the copies of the 2 March edition of {{the newspaper}}, and damaged the presses. At KTN, they shut down the power, putting the station off the air. Initially, the Kenyan information minister claimed {{no knowledge of the}} raid, but it has since revealed that Kenyan police were responsible. The Ministry of the Internal Security later stated that the incident was to safeguard state security. [...] "If you rattle a snake you must be prepared to be bitten by it," [...] John Michuki said. Three journalists at The Standard, arrested after the critical story was printed, are still being held without charge. The <b>story</b> <b>now</b> also features the bizarre case of two Armenian businessmen, mocked in the press for their taste for heavy gold chains, watches and rings, referred to as Mercenaries, who the opposition says led the raid and had shady dealings with Kibaki's government.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>story</b> <b>now</b> {{turns to}} the fate of the other child, the one who was taken by the ape, and it is this [...] branch of the story that {{occupies}} the greater part of the romance. This child is soon rescued from the ape's clutches by a knight, who then loses the baby to a gang of outlaws who take the infant to the coast to sell. The baby is bought by a travelling merchant, Clement the villain (villain in a feudal sense, as a type of farmhand, not a moral sense; Clement, in fact, earns the listener's sympathy as the story unfolds). Clement does his best for the baby, finds it a wet-nurse, brings it back to his home in Paris and gives it to his wife. They rear the little boy as their own child, naming him Florent. As he grows up, however, Florent's noble blood manifests itself when he prefers to buy a falcon rather than two oxen. On another occasion he shows an inclination to be over-generous rather than drive a hard bargain and Clement despairs, leading to some comical scenes which culminate in Florent's insistence that he should borrow his father's rusty armour to go out to fight against a giant.|$|E
