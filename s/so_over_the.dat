The song really calls for not anything really fancy. But she's always fighting the forces inside of her because she's her own devil's advocate. She {{wants to do something}} that's <b>so</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top and use her talents and the voice she has. But she also knows she has to restrain herself and do what the music really calls for.|$|E
5|$|KAL007's {{divergence}} {{prevented the}} aircraft from transmitting its position via shorter range {{very high frequency}} radio (VHF). It therefore requested KAL015, also en route to Seoul, to relay reports to air traffic control on its behalf. KAL007 requested KAL015 to relay its position three times. At 14:43UTC, KAL007 directly transmitted a change of {{estimated time of arrival}} for its next waypoint, NEEVA, to the international flight service station at Anchorage, but it did <b>so</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> longer range high frequency radio (HF) rather than VHF. HF transmissions are able to carry a longer distance than VHF, but are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference and static; VHF is clearer with less interference, and preferred by flight crews. The inability to establish direct radio communications to be able to transmit their position directly did not alert the pilots of KAL007 of their ever-increasing divergence and was not considered unusual by air traffic controllers. Halfway between Bethel and waypoint NABIE, KAL007 passed through the southern portion of the North American Aerospace Defense Command buffer zone. This zone is north of Romeo 20 and off-limits to civilian aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The pilots {{flew the}} aircraft, which can carry up to 46,860 pounds (21,255kg) of {{aviation}} fuel, in a figure eight pattern between Bob Hope Airport in Burbank and LAX {{for more than}} two hours in order to burn fuel and lower the risk of fire upon landing. This also served to lighten the plane, reducing potential stress on the landing gear and dramatically lowering landing speed as well. The Airbus A320 does not have the mechanical facility to dump fuel, despite various news agencies reporting that the aircraft was doing <b>so</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ocean.|$|E
25|$|The first Apple Stores were {{originally}} opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, {{after years of}} attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997, and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. Despite initial media speculation that Apple would fail, its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do <b>so.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> years, Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage, with 498 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of July 2017. Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.|$|E

25|$|Reeves' {{agent was}} {{amenable}} to the project, but Phoenix's agent {{would not even}} show the screenplay to the young actor. Not to be deterred, Van Sant {{got the idea for}} Reeves to personally deliver the film's treatment to Phoenix at his home in Florida. Reeves did <b>so</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Christmas holidays, riding his 1974 Norton Commando motorcycle from his family home in Canada to the Phoenix family ranch in Micanopy, Florida, outside Gainesville. Reeves was no stranger to River Phoenix or members of his family, having worked previously with River on Lawrence Kasdan's I Love You to Death and with his brother Joaquin and girlfriend Martha Plimpton on Ron Howard's Parenthood. After reading the treatment, Phoenix agreed {{to play the role of}} Scott. However, since Van Sant had already cast Reeves in the role, they had to convince River to take on the edgier role of drug-addicted hustler Mike Waters. The director promised not to make either actor do anything embarrassing.|$|E

500|$|In 1994, Michaels {{entered a}} staged rivalry with Razor Ramon, {{who had won}} the Intercontinental Championship, which had been vacated during Michaels' absence. Since Michaels had never been {{defeated}} in the ring for the title, he {{claimed to be the}} rightful champion and even carried around his old title belt. This feud culminated in a ladder match between the two at WrestleMania X. Michaels lost the match, which featured both his and Ramon's championship belts suspended above a ladder in the ring. This match was voted by fans as [...] "Match of the Year" [...] by Pro Wrestling Illustrated. It also received a 5-star rating from Wrestling Observer Newsletter member Dave Meltzer, one of five WWF/WWE matches to do <b>so.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> next few months, Michaels battled various injuries and launched the Heartbreak Hotel television talk show segment, mainly shown on Superstars.|$|E
500|$|Just as the Save Our Children {{campaign}} was a motivational force for conservative Christians, {{it was also}} one for gay and lesbian politics. Fejes writes, [...] "While the Stonewall riots of 1969 may have {{marked the beginning of}} the modern lesbian and gay movement, the campaigns of 1977 and 1978 marked the emergence of a national politically self-conscious lesbian and gay community". The birth of a political life for gays and lesbians gave opportunities for national networking as Anita Bryant and those who followed her acted as a virtual lightning rod, attracting a collective anger. Thirty years after the campaign, the Stonewall Library & Archives sponsored an exhibition of the events surrounding the Save Our Children campaign and displayed it at the Broward County Public Library. According to the curator of the exhibit, Bryant is considered [...] "the best thing to happen to the gay rights movement. She and her cohorts were <b>so</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top that it just completely galvanized the gay rights movement".|$|E

Zack Snyder wanted the film to [...] "appear very natural because there’s some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief, and we the visual effects team {{had to make it}} as easy as possible for them to do so." [...] Desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to utilize handheld devices to make the film feel like a [...] "documentary-style" [...] film. [...] "We had to think about what that would mean, since we also had to photograph some crazy action," [...] said Desjardin. [...] "So {{for a lot of the}} previs we did, we’d start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was. A lot of the rules are the Battlestar Galactica rules for the space cams that Gary Hurtzel [...] developed for that miniseries, where we want to make sure if we're translating the camera at all it makes sense.

500|$|For Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits {{created by}} {{designer}} Paul Smith, rather than custom-making {{them as she}} originally planned, as Smith [...] "was [...] about purple" [...] in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers [...] "wanted {{to find a place}} where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go <b>so</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing." [...] Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally [...] "fairly friendly color, and he’s anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon." [...] Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone [...] "who wears his clothing like an armor," [...] with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket. For a character like Trish Walker, who does not {{have the same kind of}} [...] "statement costume" [...] as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so [...] "even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of rag & bone jeans with a Chloé top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans." [...] Maslansky added that Robin was [...] "a blast to dress" [...] because of her [...] "quirky" [...] personality, yet she was still able to [...] "put herself together aesthetically." [...] For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming [...] "a little brighter and a little more hopeful." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the same}} year, prime {{minister}} Sidqi Pasha returned from negotiations in London with a draft treaty that the nationalist groups found absolutely unacceptable.

The 30th anniversary of Bryant's campaign against LGBT rights has been commemorated at the Stonewall Library & Archives, with executive director Jack Rutland dubbing her [...] "The Mother of Gay Rights". In November 2017, the campaign of Catherine Zhang and Nicholas Boucher for Harvard Undergraduate Council President and Vice President attracted the support of every single BGLTQ+ person ever, briefly turning the students into international gay icons.|$|E
