5|$|Meteorologists use the {{location}} {{of some of the}} jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting. The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against, which results in significant fuel and time cost <b>savings</b> <b>for</b> airlines. Often, the airlines work to fly 'with' the jet stream for this reason. Dynamic North Atlantic Tracks are one example of how airlines and air traffic control work together to accommodate the jet stream and winds aloft that results in the maximum benefit for airlines and other users. Clear-air turbulence, a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety, is often found in a jet stream's vicinity, but it does not create a substantial alteration on flight times. These are a narrow belt.|$|E

She stated that the days of big spending were over {{and that it was}} time to rein in public spending. Dunderdale said that there would be virtually no new spending in the upcoming provincial budget, that government departments were told to find savings and that she had ordered an audit of all government programs. She also said that her goal in the next decade is to radically decrease Newfoundland and Labrador's debt load and to achieve the same per capita debt as the Canadian average. Fiscal restraint was again the key message in the March 5, 2011, speech from the throne. The speech announced that all government departments and programs were under review. Dunderdale later stated that her government was looking for $100 million in <b>savings</b> <b>for</b> the upcoming fiscal year and that key services were exempt from cuts.|$|E
5|$|A multi-sport athlete {{during his}} college days at Transylvania College, Chandler briefly {{considered}} {{a career in}} professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree. After graduation, he entered politics and was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky Senate in 1928. Two years later, he was elected lieutenant governor, serving under Governor Ruby Laffoon. Chandler and Laffoon disagreed {{on the issue of}} instituting a state sales tax and when Chandler, the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon's allies in the General Assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state—leaving Chandler as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, Chandler defeated Laffoon's choice, Thomas Rhea. He then went on to defeat Republican King Swope by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race to that time. As governor, Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state's first income tax. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant <b>savings</b> <b>for</b> the state. He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state's education and transportation systems.|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{households}} {{spend much of their}} working lives not engaged in <b>saving</b> <b>for</b> retirement, in contrast to the basic proposition that motivates the lifecycle model of consumption. This article discusses the relationship between this observed savings behavior and three specific areas of heterogeneity in the household consumption problem: budget constraints, savings motives, and preferences. Using the Surveys of Consumer Finances, the article shows that <b>saving</b> <b>for</b> liquidity (precautionary motives) and <b>saving</b> <b>for</b> specific purchases (like housing and education) compete with <b>saving</b> <b>for</b> retirement and may explain why the median household approaches the last years of its working life with only a year's worth of income in financial assets. Another part of the explanation is shown to be high discount rates or rates of time preference, which cause households to engage in “buffer-stock” saving over the earliest years of their working lives. Heterogeneity in motives and preferences <b>for</b> <b>saving</b> present a challenge to financial professionals and policy makers who hope to encourage more people to save actively for retirement.

40|$|This study brings {{together}} both consumer behaviour and economic psychology literature to gain insights {{and understanding of}} the consumer decision-making process in the context of <b>saving</b> <b>for</b> retirement. Three research questions concerning the reasons that consumers delay <b>saving</b> <b>for</b> retirement; use a financial planner; and save but do not use a financial planner, directed the research. A factor analysis of 194 usable questionnaires led to a typology of 10 components divided between three groups correlating directly with the research questions. A key component that emerged in the factor analysis is the role of risk in delaying decision-making when financially planning for retirement. This exploratory research suggests that there are at least 11 factors associated with pre-purchase decision-making that cause consumers to delay decision-making or to take action with regard to <b>saving</b> <b>for</b> retirement. 7 page(s...|$|R
