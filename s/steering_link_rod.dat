50|$|A rod end bearing, {{also known}} as a heim joint (N. America) or rose joint (U.K. and elsewhere), is a {{mechanical}} articulating joint. Such joints are used on the ends of control <b>rods,</b> <b>steering</b> <b>links,</b> tie <b>rods,</b> or anywhere a precision articulating joint is required, and where a clevis end (which requires perfect 90 degree alignment between the attached shaft and the second component) is unsuitable. A ball swivel with an opening through which a bolt or other attaching hardware may pass is pressed into a circular casing with a threaded shaft attached. The threaded portion may be either male or female. The heim joint's advantage is that the ball insert permits the rod or bolt passing through it to be misaligned to a limited degree (an angle other than 90 degrees). A link terminated in two heim joints permits misalignment of their attached shafts (viz., other than 180 degrees) when used in tension. When used in compression, the through-rods are forced to the extreme ends of their ball's misalignment range, which cocks the link at an oblique angle.|$|R

At the same time, the FLIR(Forward Looking Infrared Radar) mounted in front of the <b>steering</b> <b>link</b> has been also damaged. In the early of this investigation, we considered the failure of the FLIR had occurred first, that FLIR hit the <b>steering</b> <b>link</b> and finally the bolt fractured. The fractured section of the bolt has shown a beach mark and a dimple mark as well. The outside of the bolt has shown a large deformation by a heavy load. As a result...|$|R

40|$|The {{hold down}} bolt {{of the fans}} of an air cooler has failed by fatigue. Investigation showed that jamming of the <b>link</b> <b>rod</b> at the eye-end due to {{corrosion}} restricted {{the rotation of the}} <b>link</b> <b>rod</b> when the positioner acted to adjust the pitch of the blade. This has resulted in excessive stresses on the hold down bolt leading to failure by fatigue. The damages seen on other parts of the air cooler are secondary and subsequent to the failure of the hold down bolt. Use of stainless steel grade material for the construction of the linkages and periodic lubrication at the eye-end of the <b>link</b> <b>rod</b> are recommended to prevent the recurrence of similar failure...|$|R

40|$|A broken tail gearbox (TGB) {{housing and}} failed pitch link {{assemblies}} {{of a helicopter}} {{were sent to the}} laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that three out of the four attachment lugs of the TGB housing had fractured by overload. The fourth one had a 2. 4 mm long fatigue crack at the fillet of the lug fusing area with the temperature sensor – locating boss. Analysis shows that the failure of this lug was also due to overload and the presence of the fatigue crack was coincidental. All the pitch <b>link</b> <b>rods</b> had fractured due to sudden overload, probably during the dislodgement of the tail rotor blades. This had also resulted in snapping of all the cables with the pitch <b>link</b> <b>rods.</b> It appears that all the failures were instantaneous and would have taken place due to sudden overload on the TGB housing...|$|R

5000|$|On modern cars {{the front}} {{suspension}} and <b>steering</b> <b>links</b> are {{designed so that}} during a turning maneuver, body roll and suspension motions will not influence the car to turn more sharply than the driver anticipates. On modern cars, {{the leading edge of}} the front tires move outwards as the suspension is compressed, and inwards as the suspension droops (extends). This is known as [...] "toe out" [...] under bump and results in roll understeer. I.E. During a turn, body roll will cause the outside suspension (relative to the curve) to compress and the inside suspension to droop (extend).|$|R

50|$|The HOSSACK front {{suspension}} system consists of 2 wish-bones, an upright and steering linkage. Similar components are found {{on the front of}} all racing cars, the only significant difference being in the up-right which has its geometry rearranged. The wish-bones look and work exactly like their racing car equivalent. The up-right performs the same task as its racing car equivalent but has its axle rotated through 90 degrees and over hung. The <b>steering</b> <b>link</b> does the same job as its name sake in car suspension. There is a handle bar pivot but this carries none of the suspension loading and only has to handle the weight of the rider’s upper half.

The seat functions like a wheelchair as it is landed to the ground. A parallelogram configuration is adopted in the mechanism design. A parallelogram linkage, in which a <b>link</b> <b>rod</b> is shaped as a cam, governs {{the motion of the}} mechanism. The cam pair mechanism, like a motion-generator cam, determines the motion to expand the lift-up mechanism. The system is kinematically analyzed. The constraint relations, velocity equations, and acceleration equations of the mechanism are obtained. The kinematic characteristics of the lift-up mechanism are investigated, which gives the guidance to design the speed of the system. The speed of the lift-up mechanism is investigated, in which the method of linear function with parabolic blends for a path with via-points is adopted in the trajectory planning...|$|R
40|$|SummaryRod photoreceptors {{contribute}} to vision over an ∼ 6 -log-unit range of light intensities. The {{wide dynamic range}} of rod vision is thought to depend upon light intensity-dependent switching between two parallel pathways <b>linking</b> <b>rods</b> to ganglion cells: a rod→rod bipolar (RB) cell pathway that operates at dim backgrounds and a rod→cone→cone bipolar cell pathway that operates at brighter backgrounds. We evaluated this conventional model of rod vision by recording rod-mediated light responses from ganglion and AII amacrine cells and by recording RB-mediated synaptic currents from AII amacrine cells in mouse retina. Contrary to the conventional model, {{we found that the}} RB pathway functioned at backgrounds sufficient to activate the rod→cone pathway. As background light intensity increased, the RB’s role changed from encoding the absorption of single photons to encoding contrast modulations around mean luminance. This transition is explained by the intrinsic dynamics of transmission from RB synapses...|$|R
40|$|Structural static {{strength}} test {{was conducted on}} the CFRP Composite Co-cured rudder for LCA, to demonstrate the structural integrity of the rudder and to experimentally determine the deflections and strains at selected locations and to correlate the test values with those obtained by theoretical analysis. The rudder was loaded upto the limit load (2614. 0 kgs) and a limit reaction load (652. 2 kgs) was also simultaneously applied. The load Vs deflection / strain behaviour was obtained. The rudder successfully withstood the limit load without any failure and the corresponding maximum tip deflection was 37. 16 mm. The maximum strain recorded was 1998 micro strain on the shear web of the front spar of the rudder. The torque monitored on the <b>link</b> <b>rod</b> was 3874. 20 N-m and the applied torque was 3675. 17 N-m. Both the deflections and strains were well within design requirements. It was therefore concluded that the structural behaviour of the rudder is satisfactory and it was cleared for flight trials. This report deals with the results of the static testing of the rudder...|$|R

5000|$|The Tomahawk has an {{independent}} suspension {{on all four}} wheels designed to allow the rider to countersteer and lean into turns like a tilting three-wheeler. There is a hub-center steering style swingarm connected to the outboard side {{of each of the}} two front wheels, with a <b>steering</b> <b>link</b> connected to the handlebar shaft. There is very little lock-to-lock steering range, only about 20° on either side of center, so the turning radius of the Tomahawk is large; [...] "only a little tighter than an SR-71", said Motorcyclists Jeff Karr. A low center of gravity, accomplished by situating the engine as low to ground as possible, is intended to provide greater control at low speeds, and a low saddle allows riders to place both feet on the ground when stopped, for greater stability. The two rear wheels also each have {{an independent}} swingarm, but on the inboard side, along with an inboard chain drive for each wheel. The rider can engage a rear suspension lock, which hydraulically holds the two wheels' relative positions, letting the vehicle stand on its own, without using a side stand.|$|R
