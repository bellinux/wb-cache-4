An FODA with a high sensitivity of 82 rad/ g and a resonance frequency of 360 Hz is designed and tested. In this system, the minimum measurable demodulation phase of the phase-generated carrier (PGC) is 10 (- 5) rad, and the minimum acceleration reaches 120 ng theoretically. This kind of FODA, with its high responsivity, all-optic-fibre configuration, small size, light weight and <b>stiff</b> shell <b>housing,</b> ensures effective performance in practice...|$|R
60|$|There {{ought to}} have been a {{tranquil}} bark in such an anchorage, and there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large <b>stiff</b> <b>house,</b> where several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.|$|R

50|$|Dick was a {{founding}} member of pub-rock act and <b>Stiff</b> Records <b>house</b> band The <b>Stiff</b> All Stars. The band was briefly signed to Stiff Records competitor Chiswick Records in 1980 and subsequently released four singles. Band line-up was Andy Murray (guitar, vocals), Nigel Dick (bass, vocals), Pete Glenister (guitar), Nicky Graham (keys), Nick Garnett (drums) Hugh Attwooll (drums). Despite band's name only Murray and Dick actually worked at Stiff Records and Glenister went on to write and produce for Alison Moyet, Kirsty MacColl, Darius; Graham went on to write and produce Bros. The band appeared on TV, toured frequently and supported Jools Holland, Any Trouble, Madness amongst others. Jamie West Oram featured in an early line-up but left to join The Fixx. Thirty years after the release of their first single The Stiff All Stars released their first album '12.5 on a 10 Point Scale' which featured new tracks and previously unreleased songs featuring Jeff Porcaro (Toto) and Carl Verheyen (Supertramp).|$|R
5000|$|As {{noted by}} Lampert, [...] "The {{persistent}} Huguenots of 17th Century Poitou and the fiercely Catholic rebellious Royalists of what came be the Vendée {{of the late}} 18th Century had ideologies very different, indeed diametrically opposed to each other. The common thread connecting both phenomena is a continuing assertion of a local identity and opposition to the central government in Paris, whatever its composition and identity. (...) In the region where Louis XIII and Louis XIV had encountered <b>stiff</b> resistance, the <b>House</b> of Bourbon gained loyal and militant supporters exactly when it had been overthrown and when a Bourbon loyalty came to imply a local loyalty {{in opposition to the}} new central government, that of Robespierre." ...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{topology}} optimization methods have existing and been improving theoretically since 1980 s; however, in industry, {{with respect to}} the certain conditions, proper modification is always desired. This study develops a specific method to utilize {{topology optimization}} for gearbox housing design. Gearbox housing maintains the position of the shafts to ensure the precision of gear engagement in all operational states (Naunheimer, et al., 2010). The current housing design processing used in Vicura AB, a Swedish powertrain company, is able to achieve <b>stiff</b> optimal <b>housing</b> material distribution, but difficult to fulfil gear misalignment requirement. This work overcomes the above shortages to develop a new methodology for gearbox housing topology optimization concerning the gear misalignment as well. The paper is starting with an introduction of the previous method and its defects, followed by a discussion of three possible improvements. Only one of them is feasible and two main difficulties need to be resolved to make it applicable. One of the difficulties is finding a linear assumption of the non-linear components and the other is deriving an approach for topology optimization involving both external forces and non-zero prescribed displacements. The corresponding solutions are described subsequently in detail both theoretically and practically. Then the results by implementing the new method and also the comparison with the results getting from the old method are presented. Finally, a validation of the new method is discussed and the conclusions and comments are given...|$|R
5000|$|Robert Perkinson, {{author of}} Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire (2010), {{wrote that the}} Offender Orientation Handbook [...] "encapsulates the weary {{institutional}} dream of imposing perfect discipline on potential chaos" [...] and that the [...] "sweeping and tedious rules" [...] "cover a bewildering range of restrictions and obligations." [...] As examples Perkinson referred to the [...] "no fighting," [...] "offenders will brush their teeth daily," [...] and [...] "horseplay is prohibited," [...] which he refers to, respectively, as [...] "sensible," [...] "well meaning," [...] and a [...] "catchall." [...] Perkinson said that in practice [...] "totalitarian order" [...] is not established in the prison because the [...] "churlish" [...] inmates {{do not have the}} inclination and [...] "often," [...] the reading ability to follow the [...] "finer dictates" [...] of the handbook, and the Correctional Officers, [...] "moderately trained, high-turnover <b>stiffs</b> earning Waffle <b>House</b> wages," [...] do not have the energy and time to enforce the rules strictly. According to Perkinson, the handbook is never consistently or fully enforced, but it is invoked by officials whenever a daily conflict occurs.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{a sketch}} of a 30 square canvas {{representing}} the house and its setting under a sulphur sun under a pure cobalt sky. The theme is a hard one! But that is exactly why I want to conquer it. Because it is fantastic, these yellow houses {{in the sun and}} also the incomparable freshness of the blue. All the ground is yellow too. I will soon send you a better drawing of it than this sketch out of my head.The house on the left is yellow with green shutters. It's the one that is shaded by a tree. This is the restaurant where I go to dine every day. My friend the factor {{is at the end of}} the street on the left, between the two bridges of the railroad. The night café that I painted is not in the picture, it is on the left of the restaurant.Milliet finds this horrible, but I don't need to tell you that when he says he doesn't understand that one can have fun doing a common grocer's shop and the <b>stiff</b> and proper <b>houses</b> without any grace, but I remember that Zola did a certain boulevard in the beginning of L'assommoir, and Flaubert a corner of the embankment of the Villette in the dog days in the beginning of Bouvard and Pécuchet which are not to be sneezed at.|$|R
500|$|The latest {{generation}} Planar 3, released in 2016, is a wholesale improvement on the classic. Rega reports that only 2 part assemblies remain unchanged from the prior RP3 model, the dustcover and dustcover hinges. Significant revisions to plinth, platter, tonearm show net improvements in fit and finish, {{as well as}} performance. The new plinth is an MDF core with a high-pressure acrylic laminate finish, and thicker braces, for improved strength and aesthetics, lowering noise floor and improving response. The main bearing well has been completely redesigned to reduce pressure on the ball bearing and hub, while allowing for a higher tolerance assembly, netting smoother operation and lower noise. A new hub (subplatter) is constructed of polycarbonate, reshaped to improve contact with the platter and lower overall resonance of the main bearing/hub/platter assembly. The 12mm platter is a new glass material, dubbed Optiwhite, is noticeably clearer in appearance and {{is said to be}} machined to higher tolerance which improves rotational stability. The old RB303 tonearm {{has been replaced by a}} new RB330 version of the classic, with patent pending [...] "zero-tolerance" [...] bearings, <b>stiffer</b> vertical bearing <b>housing,</b> redesigned bias (anti-skate) housing, improved three-point plinth mounting, a new arm tube coating, and new arm wiring. The 24V AC synchronous motor has a new control PCB and housing cover for greater consistency during assembly and improved reliability, and the power switch has been relocated under the plinth for better ergonomics. New feet are said to lower noise transfer into the turntable, via a new stiffer, wider, hollow cone design constructed from Santoprene rubber. As always, the Planar 3 is still produced in Rega's UK manufacturing plant located in Southend-on-Sea, Essex UK. Remarkably, the 2016 Planar 3 only rose in price nominally from its predecessor, revealing the benefits of Rega's increased manufacturing capacity and popularity.|$|R
