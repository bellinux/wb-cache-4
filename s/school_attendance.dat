5|$|The {{compulsory}} education period in Malta has been {{between five and}} 16 years of age since {{the introduction of the}} Education Act 1988. This is an increase from up to 12 years of age in 1924 (in this year, <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> became compulsory for those already enrolled - the act of enrollment itself was not compulsory) and 14 years of age in 1946, when compulsory <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> was introduced for all students, enrolled or otherwise. Compulsory schooling has always applied to both males and females during its existence.|$|E

5|$|Cameroon {{has one of}} {{the highest}} <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> rates in Africa. Girls attend school less {{regularly}} than boys do because of cultural attitudes, domestic duties, early marriage, pregnancy, and sexual harassment. Although attendance rates are higher in the south, a disproportionate number of teachers are stationed there, leaving northern schools chronically understaffed.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{stint as}} {{president}} of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky, where he pastored the First Presbyterian church of Lexington, Kentucky, and was appointed superintendent of public education by Governor William Owsley. The changes he effected in this office brought a tenfold increase in public <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> and led to him being called {{the father of the}} public school system in Kentucky. He left his post as superintendent after six years to become a professor at Danville Theological Seminary in Danville, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Riley's <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> was sporadic, and he {{graduated}} from grade eight at age twenty in 1869. In an 1892 newspaper article, Riley confessed that he knew little of mathematics, geography, or science, and his understanding of proper grammar was poor. Later critics, like Henry Beers, pointed to his poor education {{as the reason for}} his success in writing; his prose was written in the language of common people which spurred his popularity.|$|E

5|$|<b>School</b> <b>attendance</b> in Cameroon is also {{affected}} by child labor. Indeed, the U.S. Department of Labor Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor reported that 56% of children aged 5 to 14 were working {{children and that}} almost 53% of children aged 7 to 14 combined work and school. In December 2014, a List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor issued by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs mentioned Cameroon among the countries that resorted to child labor {{in the production of}} cocoa.|$|E
5|$|Throughout her {{undergraduate}} and medical <b>school</b> <b>attendance,</b> she dated Duane M. J. Green, an engineer. The couple married {{while she was}} studying at the University of Kansas. The couple lived together in Independence, Missouri, while Debora finished her residency, but by 1978 they had separated and then divorced. Debora cited basic incompatibility {{as the reason for}} the divorce—"e had absolutely no common interests", she was later quoted as saying—but the divorce was friendly.|$|E
5|$|Whilst the {{government}} is eager to implement the changes, many oppose the proposal, some on civil liberties grounds. Compulsory <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> is usually justified by reference to the argument that minors are incapable of making sufficiently reasoned choices. However, the 16-18 age group falls into a grey area, being regarded as effectively adult {{in a number of}} contexts. Indeed, in some jurisdictions (e.g. Scotland), individuals are considered to reach full maturity at 16.|$|E

5|$|In 1884, {{amendments}} to the Indian Act made <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> compulsory for Indigenous children between 7 and 16 years of age. The changes included a series of exemptions regarding school location, {{the health of the}} children and their prior completion of school examinations. It was changed to children between 6 and 15 years of age in 1908. The introduction of mandatory attendance was the result of pressure from missionary representatives. Reliant on student enrollment quotas to secure funding, they were struggling to attract new students due to increasingly poor school conditions.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor's Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor in Chad {{reported}} that <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> of children aged 5 to 14 was {{as low as}} 39%. This can also {{be related to the}} issue of child labor as the report also stated that 53% of children aged 5 to 14 were working children, and that 30% of children aged 7 to 14 combined work and school. A more recent DOL report listed cattle herding as a major agricultural activity that employed underage children.|$|E
5|$|Moran played college {{football}} on an athletic scholarship at the College of the Holy Cross, {{where his father}} had been a football star in the early 1930s. Moran received his B.A. in economics in 1967. In 1970, he received a Master of Public Administration from the University of Pittsburgh. After college, Moran followed his father's footstep to become an amateur boxer, and during a campaign in 1992, he admitted that he had used marijuana during his early twenties. After a brief career as a stockbroker and graduate <b>school</b> <b>attendance,</b> Moran moved to Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|North Stafford {{is located}} on State Route 610, or Garrisonville Road, {{approximately}} 3 miles from I-95 and U.S. Route 1. The <b>school's</b> <b>attendance</b> zone covers mostly the housing developments along Route 610 between Shelton Shop Road and I-95. Due to the influx of population in Stafford County in recent years, the <b>school's</b> <b>attendance</b> zones and enrollment have fluctuated greatly. Currently, North Stafford's student population is 55% White, 26% Black, 10% Hispanic, and 9% Asian/Pacific Islander.|$|R

5|$|Responsibility for {{educational}} supervision in Germany is primarily organised within the individual federal states. Optional kindergarten education is provided {{for all children}} between three and six years old, after which <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> is compulsory for at least nine years. Primary education usually lasts for four to six years. Secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels: the Gymnasium enrols the most gifted children and prepares students for university studies; the Realschule for intermediate students lasts six years and the Hauptschule prepares pupils for vocational education. The Gesamtschule unifies all secondary education.|$|E
5|$|By 1957 {{the synagogue}} sanctuary, {{which had been}} {{designed}} for 350 families, had become too small to accommodate Temple Israel's over 1,100 member families. In addition, since the 1950s Memphis's Jewish community had been steadily moving from the downtown, where Temple Israel's Poplar Avenue building was located, to the eastern suburbs; by 1957 {{over half of the}} members, and three-quarters of those with children in the congregational school, lived there. <b>School</b> <b>attendance</b> increased rapidly, and the student body soon outgrew its 1951 building. The school had to split attendance in 1959, with the younger children attending on Saturday and the older ones on Sunday, and by 1961, 780 children were enrolled. In the early 1960s, Temple Israel began holding weekday classes at Beth Sholom, which was closer to most members.|$|E
5|$|McCreary {{was not as}} {{successful}} in securing reforms during the 1914 legislative session. He advocated a comprehensive workmen's compensation law, but the law that was passed in the 1914 General Assembly was later declared unconstitutional. He also recommended a requirement for full disclosure of campaign contributions and expenditures, {{but the majority of}} legislators in the House of Representatives voted to send it back to the Suffrage and Elections Committee, from whence it was never recalled. Although they did not pass a law regulating lobbying at the capitol – a law that McCreary supported – legislators showed responsiveness to McCreary's desire for this reform by putting stricter regulations on who could be in the legislative chambers while the legislature was in session. Some reforms were made in the area of education. The school year was lengthened, <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> for children was mandated, and the legislature created a Text Book Commission to assist local school boards in adopting textbooks. Public schools expenditures were increased by 25 percent.|$|E

5|$|The Elementary Education Act 1880 {{insisted on}} {{compulsory}} attendance from 5–10 years. For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, {{as it was}} more tempting to send them working if the opportunity to earn an extra income was available. Attendance Officers often visited the homes of children who failed to attend school, which often proved to be ineffective. Children {{under the age of}} 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate to show they had reached the educational standard; employers of these children who weren't able to show this were penalised. An act brought into force thirteen years later went under the name of the Elementary Education (<b>School</b> <b>Attendance)</b> Act 1893, which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended for blind and deaf children, who previously had no means of an official education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.|$|E
5|$|The George McGovern–Robert Dole International Food for Education and Nutrition Program {{that was}} created in 2000, and funded largely through the Congress, {{would go on to}} provide more than 22 million meals to {{children}} in 41 countries over the next eight years. It was also credited with improving <b>school</b> <b>attendance,</b> especially among girls, who {{were more likely to be}} allowed to go to school if a meal was being provided. In August 2000, President Clinton presented McGovern with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in recognition of McGovern's service in the effort to eradicate world hunger. McGovern's book The Third Freedom: Ending Hunger In Our Time was published in January 2001; with its title making reference to Roosevelt's Four Freedoms speech, it proposed a plan whereby chronic world hunger could be eliminated within thirty years. In January 2001, McGovern was asked to stay on at the UN post for a while by the incoming George W. Bush administration. His stint then concluded with a termination of mission on September 28, 2001.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{grew from}} {{strength}} to strength and by 1907 the congregation numbered 150, with <b>school</b> <b>attendance</b> at 60. In time plans {{were made for}} a larger, more permanent church. This {{was the brainchild of}} Father Thomas Moloney, who bought the current presbytery and acquired the land that stood at the back so that a church could be built. The foundation stone was eventually laid on Low Sunday 1931 by Archbishop Alban Goodier, an English Jesuit who had been Archbishop of Bombay between 1919 and 1926. The new church, in Oxford Road, was designed by the diocesan architect, T. H. B. Scott. It was built of brick in the Romanesque style, seating 350. The church was built quickly and opened by Cardinal Bourne on 29 September 1931. It was officially consecrated on 14 May 1936, after its debts were cleared.|$|E
