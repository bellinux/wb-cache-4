40|$|The {{propagation}} of downwelling irradiance at wavelength lambda from surface {{to a depth}} (z) in the ocean is governed by the diffuse attenuation coefficient, K(sup -) (<b>sub</b> <b>d)</b> (lambda). There are two standard methods for the derivation of K(sup -) (<b>sub</b> <b>d)</b> (lambda) in remote sensing, which both are based on empirical relationships involving the blue-to-green ratio of ocean color. Recently, a semianalytical method to derive K(sup -) (<b>sub</b> <b>d)</b> (lambda) from reflectance has also been developed. In this study, using K(sup -) (<b>sub</b> <b>d)</b> (490) and K(sup -) (<b>sub</b> <b>d)</b> (443) as examples, we compare the K(sup -) (<b>sub</b> <b>d)</b> (lambda) values derived from the three methods using data collected in three different regions that cover oceanic and coastal waters, with K(sup -) (<b>sub</b> <b>d)</b> (490) ranging from approximately 0. 04 to 4. 0 per meter. The derived values are compared with the data calculated from in situ measurements of the vertical profiles of downwelling irradiance. The comparisons show that the two standard methods produced satisfactory estimates of K(sup -) (<b>sub</b> <b>d)</b> (lambda) in oceanic waters where attenuation is relatively low but resulted in significant errors in coastal waters. The newly developed semianalytical method appears to have no such limitation as it performed well for both oceanic and coastal waters. For all data in this study the average of absolute percentage difference between the in situ measured and the semianalytically derived K(sup -) (<b>sub</b> <b>d)</b> is approximately 14 % for lambda = 490 nm and approximately 11 % for lambda = 443 nm...|$|R

To separate signal leptons from secondary leptons from D mesons and fake leptons a method which combines several discriminating variables in a neural network has been used. A slow pion tag was used to separate the data set into two independent samples with significantly different fractions of B sup+-.

With an integrated luminosity of 20. 6 fb sup - sup 1 collected on the UPSILON(4 S) resonance by BABAR at the PEP-II asymmetric B Factory, the B meson lifetimes are measured simultaneously to be: supTAU B sup 0 = 1. 557 +- 0. 028 (stat) +- 0. 027 (syst) +- 0. 004 (DELTA m <b>sub</b> <b>d)</b> ps; supTAU B sup+- = 1. 655 +- 0. 026 (stat) +- 0. 027 (syst) +- 0. 002 (DELTA m <b>sub</b> <b>d)</b> ps.
