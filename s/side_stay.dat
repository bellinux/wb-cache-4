6000|$|At last we {{set forth}} for Silverado on foot. Kelmar and his jolly Jew girls {{were full of}} the {{sentiment}} of Sunday outings, breathed geniality and vagueness, and suffered a little vile boy from the hotel to lead them here and there about the woods. For three people all so old, so bulky in body, and belonging to a race so venerable, they could not but surprise us by their extreme and almost imbecile youthfulness of spirit. They were only going to stay ten minutes at the Toll House; had they not twenty long miles of road before them on the other <b>side?</b> <b>Stay</b> to dinner? Not they! Put up the horses? Never. Let us attach them to the verandah by a wisp of straw rope, such as would not have held a person's hat on that blustering day. And with all these protestations of hurry, they proved irresponsible like children. Kelmar himself, shrewd old Russian Jew, with a smirk that seemed just to have concluded a bargain to its satisfaction, intrusted himself and us devoutly to that boy. Yet the boy was patently fallacious; {{and for that matter}} a most unsympathetic urchin, raised apparently on gingerbread. He was bent on his own pleasure, nothing else; and Kelmar followed him to his ruin, with the same shrewd smirk. If the boy said there was [...] "a hole there in the hill"--a hole, pure and simple, neither more nor less--Kelmar and his Jew girls would follow him a hundred yards to look complacently down that hole. For two hours we looked for houses; and for two hours they followed us, smelling trees, picking flowers, foisting false botany on the unwary. Had we taken five, with that vile lad to head them off on idle divagations, for five they would have smiled and stumbled through the woods.|$|E
50|$|Spreaders- two angled, metal struts, {{attached}} about mid height on a mast, for {{the purpose}} of keeping the side stays taunt. Spreaders are usually swept rearwards approximately in line of the <b>side</b> <b>stay</b> between the hounds and the chain plate. They help hold the mast straight (in column) when under heavy load such as when carrying a spinnaker on a tight reach.|$|E
50|$|To {{arrive to}} Moore's Island by boat {{traveling}} from Sandy Point pass Gorda Cay (Castaway Cay), Long Rock {{can be passed}} on either <b>side</b> <b>stay</b> offshore in deep waters because inland is too risky. Then pass south Channel Cay (Stake Cay) which has a light tower. After passing Channel Cay take a direct approach 6 ft feet to {{the north end of}} Moore's Island to locate Hard Bargain.|$|E
2500|$|... a forestay, a backstay, {{and upper}} and lower shrouds (<b>side</b> <b>stays).</b>|$|R
50|$|Ratlines (sometimes ratlins) - Groups of <b>side</b> <b>stays</b> on {{a square}} rigged ship that have {{horizontal}} lines placed for feet, enabling crew to rapidly ascend to the yards.|$|R
50|$|Crosstree- {{two short}} metal arms that are {{attached}} to a mast athwartwise about mid height. Mast <b>side</b> <b>stays</b> are tensioned by running through the outboard end of the arms, often forming a diamond shape. Similar to a spreader.|$|R
50|$|Jib stick- A short, light spar used to {{hold out}} the jib when sailing almost {{directly}} down wind or in light airs when the jib may otherwise collapse or flap. The out board end may have a U shape to take the jib sheet or a point {{to go into the}} clew. The inboard end may be held or fastened to some convenient point such as a <b>side</b> <b>stay</b> or a purpose made fitting.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{suggestion}} that the rig was sometimes used in a lateen style with the top cross spar dipped {{at an angle to}} aid sailing to windward i.e. the spar became the luff. There is little or no evidence to support this theory. No explanation is offered as to how this could be accomplished with a square sail as the lower reefed portion of the sail would be very bulky and would prevent even an approximation of the laminar flow necessary for windward sailing. There is no evidence of any triangular sails in use. Masts were held erect by side stays and possibly fore and aft stays. Each <b>side</b> <b>stay</b> was fitted at it lower end with a 150 mm toggle. There were no chain plates. The lower part of the <b>side</b> <b>stay</b> consisted of ropes looped under the end of a knee of upper futtock which had a hole underneath. The lower part of the stay was about 500 - 800 mm long and attached to a combined flat wooden turnblock and multi V jamb cleat called an angel (maiden, virgin). About 4 turns of rope went between the angel and the toggle to give the mechanical advantage to tighten the side stays. At each turn the v shape {{at the bottom of the}} angels [...] "wings" [...] jambed the stay preventing slippage and movement.|$|E
50|$|The new pilots {{joining the}} team spend their first season flying {{at the front}} of the {{formation}} near the team leader. As their experience and proficiency improve, they move to positions further back in the formation in their second and third seasons. Pilots who start on the left of the formation stay on that side for the duration of their three-year tour; the pilots on the right <b>side</b> <b>stay</b> on the right. The exception to this are Reds 6 and 7 (the Synchro Pair), who fly in the 'stem' of the formation - the two positions behind the team leader.|$|E
50|$|The {{club was}} {{reestablished}} in 2002 {{when a new}} ownership brought the sporting rights of neighbours Massa e Cozzile {{to play in the}} third division Serie B1.Promoted after one season, the <b>side</b> <b>stayed</b> in the second division LegaDue until 2008, before folding two years later.|$|R
5000|$|From {{equation}} (4), it's {{obvious that}} [...] {{does not change}} {{as long as the}} inequality in the probability argument on the right <b>side</b> <b>stays</b> the same. In other words, adding or multiplying by a constant to all [...] does not change the choice probably, thus no change in interpretation.|$|R
50|$|The Referendum of 1919 and the {{subsequent}} union with Bavaria had unexpected consequences in 1945 {{at the end of}} the Second World War. The territory of the former Free State of Coburg now became a part of the American Occupation Zone of Germany, while the Thuringian <b>side</b> <b>stayed</b> in the Soviet Occupation Zone and later East Germany until 1990.|$|R
50|$|Banahene {{started his}} career at Ghanaian <b>side</b> <b>Stay</b> Cool F.C. He then moved to International Allies, where {{he was part of}} the team which won the 3rd edition of the Mylik Classic U-19 Tournament, played between 27-29 November 2005 at Dansoman Park, Accra, Ghana. On June 3, 2006, Heart of Lions F.C. signed him to a 3-year contract. He was then bought by Israeli side Hapoel Petach Tikva in the summer of 2008. However, he {{received}} limited playing opportunities in first half of the 2008/2009 season and was subsequently loaned to lower-division side Ramata Shalon. At the end of his loan, in October 2009, he returned to Ghana to sign a new one-year contract with Heart of Lions F.C., starting a second stint at the club. In 2010, Banahene was sold again, this time to Berekum Chelsea, and then again the following year, to Turkish club Orduspor. In 2012, he was loaned to TFF First League team Giresunspor. In summer of 2012, he signed a one-year loan deal with Karşıyaka.On December 24, 2012 he terminated his agreement with Orduspor. In January 2015 he signed for Ismaily SC in a two and a half years deal.|$|E
50|$|Stephen Rochford was {{selected}} as Mayo manager for 2016, and a poor league campaign nonetheless saw the <b>side</b> <b>stay</b> in Division 1 of the league for an 18th consecutive year. Going for a sixth successive Connacht title, hot favourites Mayo were shocked in the semi-final by Galway, who ran out winners 0-12 to 1-12. However, Mayo battled through the Qualifiers with unconvincing wins against Fermanagh, Kildare and Westmeath to reach a Quarter Final against Tyrone. In a tight game, Mayo won by a point 0-13 to 0-12. Surprise packets Tipperary awaited in the Semi-Final, which Mayo won 2-13 to 0-14 {{to set up an}} All-Ireland Final meeting with Dublin. The game ended in a draw, Mayo battled back after conceding two unfortunate own goals from Kevin McLoughlin and Colm Boyle. Cillian O'Connor got a 77th minute equalising point to bring it to a replay, the game finishing 0-15 to 2-09The replay ended yet another All-Ireland Final defeat by a single point. Cillian O'Connor had the chance with a free to bring the game to extra time in the 76th minute he missed it. It finished 1-15 to 1-14.|$|E
50|$|Albrighton was {{released}} by Doncaster in May 2006, and subsequently joined Boston United in the same month. Albrighton made 14 appearances for the Lincolnshire outfit, making his debut in a 3-2 defeat at Grimsby Town. However, first-team appearances were limited and he was loaned out to League Two rivals Darlington in November 2006. Albrighton featured three times during his one-month loan spell for the Quakers, before returning to his parent club in December. He was loaned out again in January 2007, this time to Conference National outfit Rushden & Diamonds. Albrighton impressed under manager Graham Westley, helping the <b>side</b> <b>stay</b> unbeaten throughout the month, and his loan spell was consequently extended {{until the end of}} the season. He returned to Boston in April 2007, but {{was released}} a month later and joined Cambridge United on a one-year contract. He made his debut for the Cambridgeshire side in a 2-1 victory away to York City at Bootham Crescent, and scored his first goal in a 5-1 rout of Farsley Celtic a week later. Albrighton featured a total of 45 times for the club, scoring twice, as they narrowly missed out on a return to the Football League following a 1-0 play-off final defeat to Exeter City. He was voted 'Cambridge United Player of the Year' for the 2007-08 season.|$|E
50|$|The {{family of}} cubes {{is an example}} of such a family , as is the family (m) of {{rectangles}} in R2 such that the ratio of <b>sides</b> <b>stays</b> between m&minus;1 and m, for some fixed m ≥ 1.

50|$|The hull {{design is}} {{low to the}} water and {{marginally}} wide for its length. The transom is open making the cockpit self bailing. Cockpit edges are rounded and comfortable to hike on in conjunction with hiking straps for each crew member. The bowsprit is a retractable carbon fiber pole for the asymmetrical spinnaker, which is launched from an attached bag on the port side. The centerboard boasts an impressive 4 ft draft when down and retracts by swinging aft on a pivot. The rig is supported by one set of upper <b>side</b> <b>stays</b> and one set of lower <b>side</b> <b>stays,</b> along with a forestay integrated into the roller furling jib. There is no backstay, {{and as a result}} the stern remains quite clear most of the time. Controls for the cunningham and boomvang are led back to the skipper under a removable spine that keeps them from becoming tangled in Jib Spinnaker sheets.|$|R
50|$|Named Fulgor Libertas Forlì in 2003, in {{reference}} to Libertas Forlì who had represented {{the city in the}} first division Serie A until disappearing in 1999, the <b>side</b> <b>stayed</b> ten years in the third division.They obtained a promotion to the second division LegaDue in 2010 after Fortitudo Bologna - who had beaten them in the promotion playoffs - were barred from the league for financial reasons.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a brief overview}} on the results obtained during the scale model landing gear test in the Acoustic Wind Tunnel Braunschweig 1. Noise tests were conducted on different 4 -wheel landing gear configurations with (i) deceleration plates and (ii) splitter plates. The results presented in this report indicate that deceleration plates when attached between the rear wheels downstream of the axle tend to reduce the farfield radiated landing gear noise by up to 4 dB. In {{the course of this}} test best results were obtained by means of an inner wheel deceleration plate in combination with a short lower leg deceleration plate. The installation of an upper leg deceleration plate was not effective in terms of noise reduction. For splitter plates when applied to several gear components different results were obtained. While the wheel splitter plates tend to increase noise levels nearly no effect was measured for splitter plates located at the main strut and the <b>side</b> <b>stay.</b> A slight noise reduction of about 1 dB was documented for both the torque link and the drag stay splitter plate configuration. The noise test on a 2 -wheel landing gear again proved the beneficial effect of an inner wheel deceleration plate on farfield radiated noise. ...|$|E

50|$|The upper crown {{sheet of}} the inner firebox is, as with most {{locomotive}} boilers, approximately flat and horizontal, so as to maintain a constant depth of water over this hottest part of the firebox.

50|$|From 1935, all 46 Class 12 {{locomotives}} {{were eventually}} reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers and reclassified to Class 12R. In the process, {{they were also}} equipped with Watson cabs with their distinctive slanted fronts to facilitate access to the firebox <b>side</b> <b>stays,</b> compared to the vertical fronts of the original cabs. In {{the case of the}} NBL-built locomotives, the reboilered engines were also fitted with running boards which continued straight through underneath their cabs. The new boilers raised the engine's boiler pitch by 1+1/4 in.|$|R
50|$|The bandeau {{emerged as}} the top part of a two-piece {{swimsuit}} during the 1940s. In the 1950s the bandeau incorporated foundation so as to structure (or improve) {{the contours of the}} body, while still retaining a relatively simple circle or band shape, emphasizing the bare midriff. Its popularity in swimwear declined during the string bikini era, but it reappeared in the 1980s, especially with Spandex and other stretch fabric blends. <b>Side</b> <b>stays,</b> v-wire in the center front, O-rings, and the twisted top are popular design elements.|$|R

50|$|Frontlines game modeIn the Frontlines game mode, {{players can}} choose to join {{one of the two}} {{historic}} sides of World War I, the Central Powers and the Entente. Each side fights over a turn-based frontline map that consists of multiple sectors that can be captured by either <b>side.</b> <b>Staying</b> true to the typical attrition warfare of that time, both sides attack and counter-attack each other in turn, so you will be forced to defend each captured sector of trenches. The goal is to capture the enemy's HQ sector in order to win the game.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{redesigned}} frame under the firebox, these locomotives {{were very similar}} to the Class 15C in proportions and appearance. They also had Coale pop type safety valves, a Schmidt type superheater and a combustion chamber in the firebox, which was equipped with flexible <b>side</b> <b>stays</b> and water siphon arch tubes. Their coupled wheel axleboxes, crank pins and connecting rod big ends were grease lubricated. These engines used the same Type KT tenders with a coal capacity of 14 lt t and a water capacity of 6000 imp gal.|$|R

50|$|Elsewhere, the {{international}} situation was quite good for Poland, as no outside states {{were likely to}} intervene. The southern border of Poland {{was more or less}} secure because of the weakness of the Bohemian lands, which resulted from the Hussite Wars. Although the Hanseatic League sympathized with the Prussian cities, the league backed the Teutonic Knights because the order granted them extra privileges. The Livonian Order had problems with Denmark and was unable to help the Teutonic Knights in Prussia. Because of conflict between Sweden and Denmark both <b>sides</b> <b>stayed</b> more or less neutral in the upcoming conflict.|$|R
50|$|They had 5 {{in thick}} bar frames, which {{extended}} from the front buffer beam to the rear dragbox. The boilers were equipped with three Coale pop type safety valves and Schmidt type superheaters. Their fireboxes were equipped with flexible <b>side</b> <b>stays</b> and water siphon arch tubes to support the brick arch and to improve circulation. Their Type KT tenders, arranged with self-trimming type coal bunkers, had a coal capacity of 14 lt t and a water capacity of 6000 imp gal which was considered sufficient for the engines to travel 100 mi without having to replenish water.|$|R
50|$|Cavitation {{can be used}} as an {{advantage}} in design of very high performance propellers, in form of the supercavitating propeller. In this case, the blade section is designed such that the pressure <b>side</b> <b>stays</b> wetted while the suction side is completely covered by cavitation vapor. Because the suction side is covered with vapor instead of water it encounters very low viscous friction, making the supercavitating (SC) propeller comparably efficient at high speed. The shaping of SC blade sections however, make it inefficient at low speeds, when the suction side of the blade is wetted. (See also fluid dynamics).|$|R
50|$|Al Hadd and Al Hala {{went into}} {{an end of}} season {{play-off}} to determine which <b>side</b> would <b>stay</b> in the Premier League for the following season. Al Hala won the game 1-0 after extra time.|$|R
50|$|The {{head of the}} {{triangle}} sail was the shortest-about 2m and often decorated with tufts of feathers which may have served as wind indicators. The mast was {{held in place by}} a forestay, a backstay and 2 <b>side</b> <b>stays.</b> The sheet to control the sail angle led {{from the top of the}} yard directly to the sheet handler although early British sailors were critical of the sheet being tied off. The sail was only used down wind as the waka lacked a keel or centre board to prevent leeway therefore preventing windward sailing. Rarely 2 sails of the same size, were used in larger waka.|$|R
50|$|Thermoelectric {{materials}} generate power {{directly from}} heat by converting temperature differences into electric voltage. These materials must have both high electrical conductivity (σ) and low thermal conductivity (κ) {{to be good}} thermoelectric materials. Having low thermal conductivity ensures that when one side is made hot, the other <b>side</b> <b>stays</b> cold, which helps to generate a large voltage while in a temperature gradient. The measure {{of the magnitude of}} electrons flow in response to a temperature difference across that material is given by the Seebeck coefficient (S). The efficiency of a given material to produce a thermoelectric power is governed by its “figure of merit” zT = S2σT/κ.|$|R
5000|$|East German {{football}} underwent {{major changes}} in 1965 {{with the creation of}} [...] "pure" [...] football clubs in the place of broadly generalised sports clubs. The number one football sides of SC Turbine Erfurt and BSG Optima Erfurt were merged in 1966 and revived the name FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt, while the more junior <b>sides</b> <b>stayed</b> with their original clubs. The name (Rot-Weiß meaning the two colours red and white) was unusual for its time in that the club did not have a name that honoured some socialist virtue. In 1980, Rot-Weiß Erfurt appeared in the East German Cup final, losing to Carl Zeiss Jena (1-3).|$|R
