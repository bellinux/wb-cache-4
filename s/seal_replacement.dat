The advantage of a seal gland is easy removal and <b>seal</b> <b>replacement.</b> The seal gland contains a primary seal, a secondary seal / buffer seal, bearing elements, wiper / scraper and static seal. In some cases, especially in small hydraulic cylinders, the rod gland and the bearing elements are made from a single integral machined part.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 71 The {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} rotordynamic behavior of centrifugal pumps {{has increased in}} importance over the last decade, with a steady increase in speed and power concentration. Designing a pump which has acceptable vibration characteristics when new is not sufficient. As various publications indicate, it is mainly wear of internal pump annular seals which lead to vibration problems of originally smooth running units [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The calculation of pump vibrational behavior is {{an important element in}} establishing maintenance intervals to ensure reliable operation. While the mechanical rotor system and boundary conditions at journal bearings can be modelled quite accurately, interaction forces within the hydraulic part of the pump are not well known. Impeller interaction is one important influence on rotordynamics. However, these forces are not sensitive to internal wear. Impeller interaction is treated by several authors [7, 8, 9]. Reliable dynamic modelling of annular seals is established within centrifugal pumps. Measured results of a full scale test machine are presented and used to conform the newly developed, improved model. The overall influence of a change in seal design from smooth to serrated is shown. Additionally, it is demonstrated why the effect of wear deteriorates vibrational behavior and leads to the requirement of periodic internal <b>seal</b> <b>replacement...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} precast {{concrete}} wall systems are compared to curtain wall and window wall systems {{in terms of}} durability and disaster resilience of multi-story buildings. Window wall systems are currently the enclosure system of choice for tall residential buildings {{in most parts of}} North America. Precast concrete wall systems can be expected to last the lifetime of a building with routine <b>seal</b> <b>replacement.</b> These are highly durable systems. Windows within precast concrete wall systems will require replacement in 25 - 35 years but represent a limited portion of the wall area and hence are less costly and have less impact on building use interruption. The impact of fa√ßade choice on passive survivability and security are also considered. Maintaining livable temperatures in a space in Toronto, Ontario (a city with a climate similar to many Northern U. S. cities) during a power outage is shown to mostly depend on having little heat loss, reducing solar gains, and provision of thermal mass. A whole wall metric is also introduced which combines various vision and non-vision wall system heat loss components. A similar metric for solar gain is introduced. The most significant factor affecting this heat loss and solar gain (and thereby affecting thermal resilience) is to avoid high Window to Wall Ratios (WWR). This will apply for most wall systems but is most significant for systems like precast concrete where there is minimal thermal bridging through the insulation. In terms of security, precast concrete walls will protect occupants from projectiles and endure little damage during disasters. These impacts make precast concrete wall systems significantly more disaster resilient...|$|E
40|$|The {{processing}} rate of Savannah River Site (SRS) {{high-level waste}} decontamination processes {{are limited by}} the flow rate of the solid-liquid separation. The baseline process, using a 0. 1 micron cross-flow filter, produces {approx} 0. 02 gpm/sq. ft. of filtrate under expected operating conditions. Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) demonstrated significantly higher filter flux for actual waste samples using a small-scale rotary filter. With funding from the U. S. Department of Energy Office of Cleanup Technology, SRNL personnel are evaluating and developing the rotary microfilter for radioactive service at SRS. The authors improved the design for the disks and filter unit to make them suitable for high-level radioactive service. They procured two units using the new design, tested them with simulated SRS wastes, and evaluated {{the operation of the}} units. Work to date provides the following conclusions and program status: (1) The authors modified the design of the filter disks to remove epoxy and Ryton{reg_sign}. The new design includes welding both stainless steel and ceramic coated stainless steel filter media to a stainless steel support plate. The welded disks were tested in the full-scale unit. They showed good reliability and met filtrate quality requirements. (2) The authors modified the design of the unit, making installation and removal easier. The new design uses a modular, one-piece filter stack that is removed simply by disassembly of a flange on the upper (inlet) side of the filter housing. All seals and rotary unions are contained within the removable stack. (3) While it is extremely difficult to predict the life of the seal, the vendor representative indicates a minimum of one year in present service conditions is reasonable. Changing the seal face material from silicon-carbide to a graphite-impregnated silicon-carbide is expected to double the life of the <b>seal.</b> <b>Replacement</b> of the current seal with an air seal could increase the lifetime to 5 years and is undergoing testing in the current work. (4) The bottom bushing showed wear due to a misalignment during the manufacture of the filter tank. Replacing the graphite bushing with a more wear resistant material such as a carbide material will increase the lifetime of the bushing. This replacement requires a more wear resistant part or coating to prevent excessive wear of the shaft. The authors are currently conducting testing with the more wear resistant bushing. (5) The project team plans to use the rotary microfilter as a filter in advance of an ion exchange process under development for potential deployment in SRS waste tank risers...|$|E
40|$|This report details {{redesign}} of a commercially available rotary microfilter {{to meet the}} operational and maintenance requirements for radioactive service. Personnel developed the design and coordinated procurement of two filters followed by testing of one unit. System testing examined the ability to rinse soluble material from the system, filtration performance using several insoluble solids loadings, effectiveness in washing sludge, amount of wear to parts and maintenance of the system including the insertion and removal of the filter stack, {{and the ability to}} flush solids from the system. The test program examined flushing the filter for soluble material by filling the system with a Rhodamine WT dye solution. Results showed that draining the system and rinsing with 50 gallons of water resulted in grater than 100 X reduction of the dye concentration. Personnel determined filter performance using various amounts of insoluble sludge solids ranging from 0. 06 to 15 weight percent (wt%) insoluble solids in a 3 molar (M) sodium simulated supernate. Through approximately 120 hours of start-and-stop (i. e., day shift) operation and various insoluble solids loadings, the filter produced filtration rates between 3 and 7 gallons per minute (gpm) (0. 12 - 0. 29 gpm/ft{sup 2 }) for a 25 -disk filter. Personnel washed approximately 80 gallons of simulated sludge using 207 gallons of inhibited water. Washing occurred at constant volume with wash water fed to a well mixed tank {{at the same rate as}} filtrate removal. Performance measurement involved collecting and analyzing samples throughout the washing for density and sodium content. Results showed an effective washing, mimicking a predicted dilution calculation for a well mixed tank and reducing the sodium concentration from 3. 2 M to less than 0. 3 M. Filtration rates during the washing process ranged between 3 and 4. 3 gpm for one filter unit. The filter system then concentrated the washed 15 wt% insoluble solids slurry to approximately 20 wt% insoluble solids with no operational problems with the exception of the entrainment of air due to leaking packing in the feed pump. Prior to the air entrainment, the filtration rate was approximately 4. 2 gpm for one filter assembly with the process fluid temperature adjusted to 35 C. Personnel measured the turbidity of filtrate samples from all phases of testing. All samples measured were less than 3 NTU, with the majority of samples less than 1 NTU. Thus, all measurements fell below the process acceptance criterion of less than 5 NTU. After slurry operations, personnel rinsed the filter with the equivalent of 250 gallons of water by re-circulating 50 gallons of water. The residual sludge solids remaining on the filter stack weighed approximately 685 grams. This amount of solids corresponds to an equivalent activity of 15. 1 curies (Ci) beta and 0. 38 Ci gamma radiation dose for Sludge Batch 4. Workers completely disassembled the filter system and examined it for signs of wear and component operation. An evaluation by a John Crane Inc. representative concluded that the wear observed on the mechanical seal resulted primarily from the numerous stops and starts, the abrasive nature of the process fluid and the possibility that the seal faces did not receive enough lubrication from the process fluid. No measurable slurry bypassed the mechanical seal. While it is extremely difficult to predict the life of the seal, the vendor representative indicates a minimum of one year in present service is reasonable. Changing the seal face material from silicon-carbide to a graphite-impregnated silicon-carbide is expected to double the life of the <b>seal.</b> <b>Replacement</b> with an air seal might be expected to increase lifetime to five years. The bottom bushing showed wear due to a misalignment during the manufacture of the filter tank.

40|$|Outdated {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} fish passage facilities were recently reconstructed at the five major irrigation dams {{on the lower}} Umatilla River, Oregon to meet National marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) design standards. Changes in design at juvenile fish bypass facilities included reduced mesh size on the rotating drum screens, larger screening area, a more oblique orientation of the drum screens to canal flow, improved screen <b>seals,</b> <b>replacement</b> of bypass portals with vertical slot bypass channels, and increased bypass pipe diameters. Weir-and-pool adult fish ladders and jump pools were replaced with vertical-slot ladders.

Water velocities in front of canal screens, at bypass channel entrances, and at ladder diffusers were measured to assess adherence to NMFS criteria and identify hydraulic patterns.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a field study and telephone survey into the impact of window replacement on air infiltration and moisture problems in UK dwellings. The results of a telephone survey of 250 UK houses suggested that the installation of tight, well <b>sealed</b> <b>replacement</b> windows {{does not appear to be}} causing a significant increase in IAQ problems as perceived by the occupants. After having windows replaced only 2 % of respondents (5 households) reported worse problems with condensation and only 1 % (3 households) reported worse problems with mould. However, the results of "before and after" fan pressurisation tests on ten dwellings suggested that the installation of modern replacement windows reduced the predicted heating season mean background air change rate by an average 0. 23 ac/h (standard deviation 0. 08 ac/h). Analysis of the results suggests that installation of replacement windows in UK dwellings significantly reduces background infiltration rates, and that 65 % of dwellings in the UK would have a predicted heating season mean air change rate below 0. 5 ac/h after the installation of new windows. Houses with high moisture production, and low ventilation rates are potentially at risk from increased moisture problems after window replacement and may benefit from the installation of additional controllable ventilation during window replacement. However, the telephone survey which indicates that window replacement has not caused worsening IAQ suggests that occupants are ventilating adequately for their moisture production rates. If increased occupant venting occurs, then this may have the detrimental effect of increasing the space heating energy consumption...|$|R

Therefor {{the value of a}} b field must be collected by the verifier before verification can be performed. This is useful to link a physical object with an barcode and/or RFID tag to be used as an anti-counterfeiting measure; for example the seal number of a bottle of wine may be a b field. The verifier needs to enter the seal number for a successful verification since it is not stored in the barcode on the bottle. When the seal is broken the seal number may also be destroyed and yielded unreadable; the verification can therefore not take place since it requires the <b>seal</b> number. A <b>replacement</b> <b>seal</b> must display the same seal number; using holograms and other techniques may make the generation of a new copied seal number not viable. Similarly the unique tag ID, also known is the TID in ISO/IEC 18000, can be used in this manner to prove that the data is stored on the correct tag. In this case the TID is a b field. The interrogator will read the DigSig envelope from the changeable tag memory and then read the non-changeable unique TID to allow for the verification. If the data was copied from one tag to another, then the verification process of the signed TID, as stored in the DigSig envelope, will reject the TID of the copied tag.|$|R

Billions {{of dollars are}} lost from tribological inefficiencies per year, {{and at the same}} time, the state-of-the-art is pushing triboelements toward greater capabilities such as load support and longevity. A potential advancement comes from including a poroviscoelastic material in triboelements. It is hypothesized that poroviscoelasticity can improve triboelement dynamic properties such as loss and wear resistance without sacrificing significant load support. A poroviscoelastic material has multiple features that make it interesting for study: porous structure for lubricant storage, a built-in dissipation mechanism, and adaptive storage and loss characteristics. A fractional calculus poroviscoelastic model will be implemented in ABAQUS, a commercially available finite element analysis (FEA) software.
