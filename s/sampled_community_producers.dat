50|$|In 1997, the CRTC {{deregulated}} {{community television}} in Canada, causing a protracted period of political tension between cable companies and community groups. After complaints to the CRTC from the Canadian public, a policy review process was initiated, culminating in CRTC Decision 2002-61, a reinvigoration of the participatory {{elements of the}} community channel. Under 2002-61, community channels can be run by independent community groups, and up to one-half of the channel must be made available for independent <b>community</b> <b>producers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Being a cinematographic project whose spread {{is based}} {{mostly in the}} use of social networks, and synergy between {{audience}} and creators, the network material of the movie is centered mostly {{in the creation of a}} fan <b>community.</b> <b>Producers,</b> regardless of their monetary participation in the film, form part of Programme K, a social group in which they can relate between each other, follow the development of the film, and take advantage of special perks and draws for Programme K members.|$|R

40|$|In Ghana, {{virtually}} the entire coastline is strewn with marine fishing. Artisanal marine fishing however dominates the industry. The trade is essentially informal in nature. The communication pattern in this occupation is quite unique. Various modes and symbols, both tangible and intangible, serve as communication sources and media of information {{in the conduct of}} daily business. This study describes and records the nonverbal modes and symbols of communication in artisanal marine fishing in Ghana. It examines whether there are differences in the observed nonverbal communicative patterns among the <b>sampled</b> <b>communities,</b> and also assesses how time and modernity have affected the kind of communication pattern employed. It is qualitative, and employs a multiple case design that purposively <b>samples</b> three <b>communities</b> in the Central Region of Ghana. It is grounded on Morris’s semiotics on signs, behaviour and interaction, and Wilson’s taxonomy of non-verbal perspective of indigenous communication. Findings show that the stars, winds, waves, cultural events, among others communicate relevant messages to the fisherman. Differences in the nonverbal communicative pattern among the <b>sampled</b> <b>communities</b> are rather minimal, and attributed to variations in local culture. Technological advancement is also gradually catching up on the otherwise traditional occupation...|$|R

50|$|On 12 July 2007, the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts had {{implemented}} {{changes to}} the Indigenous Broadcasting Program {{in support of a}} new national indigenous TV channel. It was decided that the existing open-narrowcast licence from Imparja would be used to initially carry the channel, which resulted in ICTV ceasing transmission. For 2 years, ICTV Limited had no means of broadcasting content unless it was commissioned by National Indigenous Television, which was at odds with the company. The NITV commissioning model allegedly left out remote <b>community</b> <b>producers</b> {{due to the nature of}} how funding was allocated and other mandatory requirements.|$|R

5000|$|Mapping: The CIETmap module creates {{interpolated}} raster maps out of {{data from}} <b>sample</b> <b>communities.</b> The software also adjusts for over- or under-representation in the <b>sample</b> <b>communities</b> during the interpolation. It then displays user defined ranges with an associated legend. If they choose, users can see the maps in three dimensions and from different angles. CIETmap can also classify or display administrative boundaries and geographic features, as well as pictorial symbols. A morph/animation module can help make predictions based on epidemiological risk analysis (such as the likely impact of an intervention), or show changes in a situation over time -i.e.: data from repeat surveys. It does this through animation, which {{makes it easier for}} viewers to follow the changes, as they happen -or would happen- in each place on the map. These [...] "morph" [...] maps can either be run from within CIETmap or exported to external animated gifs.|$|R
