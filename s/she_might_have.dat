5|$|During her {{subsequent}} {{testimony before}} the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee {{as part of the}} confirmation hearings, she refused to answer questions about her view on the constitutionality of some issues such as the death penalty as it was an issue that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> to vote on if it came before the court.|$|E
5|$|Henry's plans shifted {{when the}} Empress Matilda's husband, the Emperor Henry, died in 1125. King Henry {{recalled}} {{his daughter to}} England {{the next year and}} declared that, should he die without a male heir, she was to be his rightful successor. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have.</b> Putting forward a woman as a potential heir in this way was unusual: opposition to Matilda continued to exist within the English court, and Louis was vehemently opposed to her candidacy.|$|E
5|$|Hysterical Lydia, {{who thought}} Sarah and Zoe were having an affair, had a {{conversation}} with Charlotte and revealed when they split up, she attempted suicide, proving the character's vulnerability. After sabotaging Zoe's parachute, they are mixed up and a terrified Lydia began to worry that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> got the sabotaged parachute. While doing the jump, Zoe's deploys, however Sarah's does not. As she hits the ground, Lydia screams in terror. She is completely destroyed by Sarah's death, but does not admit to being responsible when Zoe is arrested, and with that Lydia tries to commit suicide once again.|$|E

6000|$|Dominie Sampson also rose; {{but it was}} {{to stand}} aghast with utter astonishment. The idea of parting from Miss Lucy, go where <b>she</b> <b>might,</b> <b>had</b> never once {{occurred}} to the simplicity of his understanding. He laid the money on the table. 'It is certainly inadequate,' said Mac-Morlan, mistaking his meaning, 'but the circumstances--' ...|$|R
60|$|A doubt troubled her whether <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> {{passed the}} milestone. She {{stopped and looked}} at the sky.|$|R
5|$|In 1669, Anna Maria Luisa was {{considered}} as a potential bride to Louis, le Grand Dauphin, the heir-apparent of Louis XIV of France. Cosimo III {{did not like the}} idea of a French marriage, and never devoted himself fully to the cause (she was later rejected). Instead, Cosimo offered her to his first choice, Peter II of Portugal. Peter's ministers, fearing that Princess Anna Maria Luisa would dominate Peter II and fearing <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> inherited Marguerite Louise’s manner, declined. In fact, contemporaries thought her traits to be a combination of those of her father and paternal grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{returned}} to Normandy in 1125 and spent {{about a year}} at the royal court, where her father Henry was still hoping that his second marriage would generate a male heir. In the event that this might fail to happen, Matilda was now Henry's preferred choice, and he declared that she was to be his rightful successor if he should die without a male heir. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore in January to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August. He told the court that his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> welcomed daytime help.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, Valiente {{became a member}} of a far right white {{nationalist}} political party, the National Front, for about eighteen months, during which she designed a banner for her local branch. Valiente's biographer Philip Heselton suggested that the party's nationalistic outlook may have appealed to her strongly patriotic values and that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> hoped that the Front would serve as a political equivalent to the Pagan movement. At the same time she also {{became a member of}} another, more extreme far right group, the Northern League. However, she allowed her membership of the National Front to lapse, sending a letter to her local branch stating that although she respected its leader John Tyndall and had made friends within the group, she was critical of the party's opposition to women's liberation, gay rights, and sex education, all of which she lauded as progressive causes. Heselton has also suggested that Valiente may have joined these groups in order to investigate them before reporting back to Britain's intelligence agencies.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been able to do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her {{there was nothing to be}} done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
5|$|If Mary was {{to secure}} England for Roman Catholicism, she needed an heir. On {{the advice of}} the Holy Roman Emperor she married his son, Philip II of Spain; she needed to prevent her Protestant {{half-sister}} Elizabeth from inheriting the Crown and thus returning England to Protestantism. There was opposition, and even a rebellion in Kent (led by Sir Thomas Wyatt); even though it was provided that Philip would never inherit the kingdom if there was no heir, received no estates and had no coronation. He was there to provide an heir. But she never became pregnant, and likely suffered from cancer. Ironically, another blow fell. Pope Julius died and his successor, Pope Paul IV, declared war on Philip and recalled Pole to Rome to have him tried as a heretic. Mary refused to let him go. The support <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> expected from a grateful Pope was thus denied.|$|E

60|$|Indeed <b>she</b> <b>might</b> well <b>have</b> {{been one}} whose human blood was mixed {{with some other}} alien strain--as she had called herself, a {{daughter}} of the Moon.|$|R
5|$|Fatboy begins {{running the}} car lot when Charlie leaves Walford. His {{friendship}} with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) grows {{and they have}} a one-night stand, but, feeling it is making their friendship weird, he rejects her afterwards despite her thinking <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> deeper feelings for him. Things between them are awkward, and when Donna's foster brother Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) finds out, he confronts Fatboy and locks him a cupboard. He returns the next day to find that Fatboy has not been discovered, and from how scared Fatboy is, realises something is wrong. Fatboy opens up about the fact his mother used to lock him up for extended periods of time, which led to him assuming the comedic persona of 'Fatboy'. Vincent convinces him to use his real name, Arthur, again, and gives him a job as DJ at his bar The Albert as long as he no longer puts on a false persona, starting with admitting to Donna that he will now be showing his true self to her. Over the coming weeks, Fatboy gets tangled in Vincent's vendetta against the Mitchell family and trying to kill Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Fatboy repeatedly tries to convince Vincent to stop, and interrupts Vincent when as he is about to throttle Phil. Fed up with his interference, Vincent threatens Fatboy with violence against Dot if he does not leave Walford forever. Fatboy tells Dot {{that he is going to}} see his father for Christmas, and shares a final dinner with her before saying goodbye. He confronts Vincent one last time, demanding that he stay away from Dot, and leaves Walford.|$|E

25|$|Buster Hadfield: An {{extremely}} lazy divorcee {{who once}} {{spent more time}} at the Lodge than at home, precipitating his divorce. His daughter Susie once stole Harold's lunch money, but it was latter found that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> feelings for Harold, which of course when nowhere.|$|E
60|$|This {{straightforward}} question struck Carley as singularly {{as if it}} was one <b>she</b> <b>might</b> never <b>have</b> encountered. It {{forced her}} to think of things she had buried.|$|R

25|$|Von Meck {{also knew}} that Tchaikovsky was often in need of cash, despite the large sums she gave him. Tchaikovsky was a poor manager of money and would ask her for the next year's {{allowance}} several months in advance. Knowing of this habit, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> anticipated his needing the money.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{theories}} {{speculated that}} she had been in unusually high spirits and had decided to run away to start a new life, was going to meet a secret lover and went off with him, or had become injured and suffered from amnesia. Darker theories speculated that Paula was depressed and may have committed suicide, <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been kidnapped or murdered.|$|E
25|$|Beth Jarrett, 39. A {{homemaker}} who {{has long}} kept the Jarrett household neat and well-organized, {{to the point of}} being anal retentive. She plays golf and is very active in the community but does not work outside the home. The novel gives little detail of her personal background, although her still-living parents provide some clues as to how <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> become this way.|$|E

25|$|The {{discussion}} of breastfeeding during early prenatal care can positively effect a woman's likelihood to breastfeed her child. During regular checkups, a woman's physician, midwife or other healthcare provider can initiate {{a conversation about}} the benefits of breastfeeding, which can influence a woman to breastfeed her child {{for a longer period of}} time than <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> otherwise. In addition, the involvement of lactation consultants in the prenatal visits of low-income women increases the likelihood that they will breastfeed.|$|E
25|$|Captain George Parker assumed {{command of}} Santa Margarita in December 1796. On 21 June 1797 she {{captured}} the privateer San Francisco (alias Los Amigos) off the Irish coast. San Francisco was pierced for 14 guns {{and had a}} crew of 53 men. She was from St Sebastian and had cruised between Scilly and Cape Clear for 20 days without having captured anything. She was apparently quite new and sailed well. Parker observed that with better luck <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> done some mischief.|$|E
25|$|After the war, McCord left South Carolina for a time, went to Charlottesville, Virginia, and thence {{further to}} Canada —to Coburg and other points. But, finding {{that she could}} not remain away from South Carolina, she returned, and, though embittered by it, took the oath of {{allegiance}} that <b>she</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> the disposal of her own property. The latter years of McCord's life were spent in Charleston, in the home of her son-in-law, Major Augustine T. Smythe, and his wife, her daughter Louisa.|$|E

But that's only guess-work again: it's all guess-work at {{this part of}} her story. You catch me {{at the end of}} my evidence, dad, when you come to Miss Gwilt's proceedings in the spring and summer of the present year. <b>She</b> <b>might,</b> or <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not, <b>have</b> been desperate enough to attempt suicide; and <b>she</b> <b>might,</b> or <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not, <b>have</b> been at the bottom of those inquiries that I made for Mrs. Oldershaw.
