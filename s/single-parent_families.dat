The breadwinner-homemaker family and economic model does not apply to <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> because the single-parent must be both roles at all times. Because child care services cost a substantial amount, low-income mothers spend a higher percentage of their income on child care than middle class mothers do.

In the United States, state assistance for childcare is nowhere near the level of other developed countries and has actually decreased.|$|E
25|$|The income {{distribution}} (2001 Census) shows {{a higher proportion}} of lower-income groups and a lower proportion of higher-income groups compared to the whole of Auckland City. This is partially due to a higher number of pensioners and <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> who are usually on fixed incomes and thus poorer. In 2001, the median income for those older than 15 was $15,600 (compared to $23,500 in 2006). In 2013 the median personal income was $27,200, slightly lower than the Auckland median at $29,600 due to a larger number of pensioners over 65 in the demographic pyramid.

By 1986, particular attention was being focused on assisting women in <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> {{to get back into}} employment, in recognition of the growing problems associated with extra-marital births and marital breakdown. Parental leave was extended to firms with 100 employees in 1981 (previously, parental leave provision had been made in 1977 for firms employing at least 200 employees) and subsequently to all employees in 1984. From 1984 onwards, married women were obliged to sign tax returns, men and women were provided with equal rights in managing their common property and that of their children, and in 1985 they became responsible for each other’s debts.|$|E
25|$|Of 6,649 {{people at}} the {{beginning}} of the census of the people in 1793, the commune reached a demographic peak in 1861 with 17,180 inhabitants, prior to be severely affected by the War of 1870 by losing nearly 1,000 of its children. Then began a slow decline accentuated by the World War I, no longer accommodating more than 10,132 inhabitants in 1946. The second half of the 20th century - with the absorption of Saint-Nicolas-près-Granville in 1962, the rural exodus and the construction of many estates on the outskirts - allowed the commune to win residents again to achieve 13,022 inhabitants in 2006. That same year, only 0.5% of the Granville population was foreign, with the presence small Portuguese, Spanish and Moroccan communities each representing 0.1% of the population, far from the regional average of 8.8%, and 16.9% of households consisted of <b>single-parent</b> <b>families,</b> ten points under this same regional average.|$|E
25|$|Under Olof Palme's premiership tenure, matters {{concerned}} with child care centers, social security, {{protection of the}} elderly, accident safety, and housing problems received special attention. Under Palme the public health system in Sweden became efficient, with the infant mortality rate standing at 12 per 1,000 live births. An ambitious redistributive programme was carried out, with special help provided to the disabled, immigrants, the low paid, <b>single-parent</b> <b>families,</b> and the old. The Swedish welfare state was significantly expanded from a position already {{one of the most}} far-reaching in the world during his time in office. As noted by Isabela Mares, {{during the first half of}} the Seventies “the level of benefits provided by every subsystem of the welfare state improved significantly.” Various policy changes increased the basic old-age pension replacement rate from 42% of the average wage in 1969 to 57%, while a health care reform carried out in 1974 integrated all health services and increased the minimum replacement rate from 64% to 90% of earnings. In 1974, supplementary unemployment assistance was established, providing benefits to those workers ineligible for existing benefits. In 1971, eligibility for invalidity pensions was extended with greater opportunities for employees over the age of 60. In 1974, universal dental insurance was introduced, and former maternity benefits were replaced by a parental allowance. In 1974, housing allowances for families with children were raised and these allowances were extended to other low-income groups. Childcare centres were also expanded under Palme, and separate taxation of husband and wife introduced. Access to pensions for older workers in poor health was liberalised in 1970, and a disability pension was introduced for older unemployed workers in 1972.|$|E

500|$|Central to feminist {{economics}} {{is a different}} approach to the [...] "family" [...] and [...] "household." [...] In classical economics, those units are typically described as amicable and homogeneous. Gary Becker and new home economists introduced the study of [...] "the family" [...] to traditional economics, which usually assumes the family is a single, altruistic unit among which money is distributed equally. Others have concluded that an optimal distribution of commodities and provisions takes place within the family as a result of which they view families {{in the same manner as}} individuals. These models, according to feminist economists, [...] "endorsed traditional expectations about the sexes," [...] and applied individualistic rational-choice models to explain home behavior. Feminist economists modify these assumptions to account for exploitative sexual and gender relations, <b>single-parent</b> <b>families,</b> same-sex relationships, familial relations with children, and the consequences of reproduction. Specifically, feminist economists move beyond unitary household models and game theory to show the diversity of household experiences.|$|E
