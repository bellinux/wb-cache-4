It bore a spray of the most lovely white flowers. On the top petal (if it is a petal), and also on the lip of each of these rounded flowers was a blotch or spot of which the general effect was similar to the {{iridescent}} eye on the tail feathers of a peacock, whence, I suppose, the flower was named [...] "Pavo," [...] or Peacock.|$|E

6000|$|... "So Mr. Snake {{found that}} lying {{helped him to}} cheat and steal, {{and all the time}} he kept {{thinking}} how smart he was. But even Mr. Snake {{had a little bit of}} conscience, and once in a while it would trouble him. <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think he did? Why, cheating had become such a habit with him that he actually tried to cheat himself--to cheat his conscience! When he was telling a lie, he would wink one eye. 'That,' said he to himself, 'means that it isn't true, and if these folks are not smart enough to see me wink and know what it means, it is their own fault if they believe what I am telling them.' But always he took care to wink the eye that was turned away from the one he was talking to.|$|E
6000|$|Alfred leant {{upon his}} elbow, his eyes full stretched, but {{feeling as if}} all his senses had gone into his ears, in his agony to hear more; and he even seemed to catch his mother's voice, {{but there was no}} hope in that; it was of her knowing it would be all for the best; and the sadness of it told him that she {{believed}} the same as Betsey. Then came, 'Yes; I declare it gave me such a turn, you might have knocked me down with a feather. I asked Mr. Blunt to come in and see what's good for Mother, she feels so weak at times, and has such a noise in her head, just like the regiment playing drums, she says, till she can't hardly bear herself; and <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think he says? Don't wrap up her head so warm, says he--a pretty thing for a doctor to say, as if a poor old creature like that, past seventy years old, could go without a bit of flannel to her head, and her three night-caps, and a shawl over them when there's a draught. I say, Cousin, I ha'n't got much opinion of Mr. Blunt. Why don't you get some of them boxes of pills, that does cures wonderful? Ever so many lords and ladies cured of a perplexity fit, by only just taking an imposing draught or two.' ...|$|E

In some degree, however, it is indeed not unjust; in some degree, it is {{necessary}} and intended. It is assuredly just that idleness should be surpassed by energy; that the widest influence should be possessed {{by those who are}} best able to wield it; and that a wise man, {{at the end of his}} career, should be better off than a fool. But for that reason, is the fool to be wretched, utterly crushed down, and left in all the suffering which his conduct and capacity naturally inflict?--Not <b>so.</b> <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> suppose fools were made for? That you might tread upon them, and starve them, and get the better of them in every possible way? By no means. They were made that wise people might take care of them. That is the true and plain fact concerning the relations of every strong and wise man to the world about him. He has his strength given him, not that he may crush the weak, but that he may support and guide them. In his own household he is to be the guide and the support of his children; out of his household he is still to be the father--that is, the guide and support--of the weak and the poor; not merely of the meritoriously weak and the innocently poor, but of the guiltily and punishably poor; of the men who ought to have known better--of the poor who ought to be ashamed of themselves. It is nothing to give pension and cottage to the widow who has lost her son; it is nothing to give food and medicine to the workman who has broken his arm, or the decrepit woman wasting in sickness. But it is something to use your time and strength to war with the waywardness and thoughtlessness of mankind; to keep the erring workman in your service till you have made him an unerring one; and to direct your fellow-merchant to the opportunity which his dulness would have lost. This is much; but it is yet more, when you have fully achieved the superiority which is due to you, and acquired the wealth which is the fitting reward of your sagacity, if you solemnly accept the responsibility of it, as it is the helm and guide of labour far and near.|$|E

For you who have it in your hands, are in reality the pilots of the power and effort of the State.[16] It is entrusted to you as an authority to be used for good or evil, just as completely as kingly authority was ever given to a prince, or military command to a captain. And, according to the quantity of it that you have in your hands you are the arbiters of the will and work of England; and the whole issue, whether the work of the State shall suffice for the State or not, depends upon you. You may stretch out your sceptre over the heads of the English labourers, and say to them, as they stoop to its waving, [...] "Subdue this obstacle that has baffled our fathers, put away this plague that consumes our children; water these dry places, plough these desert ones, carry this food to those who are in hunger; carry this light to those who are in darkness; carry this life to those who are in death;" [...] or on the other side you may say to her labourers: [...] "Here am I; this power is in my hand; come, build a mound here for me to be throned upon, high and wide; come, make crowns for my head, that men may see them shine from far away; come, weave tapestries for my feet, that I may tread softly on the silk and purple;[17] come, dance before me, that I may be gay; and sing sweetly to me, that I may slumber; so shall I live in joy, and die in honour." [...] And better than such an honourable death, it were that the day had perished wherein we were born, and the night in which it was said there is a child conceived.|$|E
