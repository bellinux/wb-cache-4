40|$|Until now, {{there is}} no method {{can be used to}} {{accurately}} assess the particles size distribution as well as textural classes of gypsiferous soils for proper interpretation of physical behavior of these soils, and most laboratory methods involve pretreatment to remove gypsum from the samples. Therefore, the results of the particle size distribution do not reflect the size distribution of the whole soil. This study aimed to develop an alternative method to determine particle size distribution for some gypsiferous soils selected from Al-Ahsa governorate, Saudi Arabia. Five samples from different profiles with different gypsum content were selected to evaluate the modified method. <b>Sand</b> <b>fractions</b> were separated with three disaggregation methods: 1) drying sieving, 2) shaking for 5 hours in a 7 : 3 ethanol: water solution, and 3) sonication for 3 minutes in a 7 : 3 ethanol: water solution. The statistical analysis results revealed that the sonication for 3 minutes in a 7 : 3 ethanol: water solution was the most effective method for separating <b>sand</b> <b>fractions</b> as compared to dry sieving and shaking. Meanwhile, there was slight difference in separating <b>sand</b> <b>fractions</b> between sonication for 3 minutes and shaking for 5 hours. The particle size distribution by the developed method showed increasing in total sand content as compared to standard particle size method. Likewise, comparison of the CEC/clay ratio between the two methods also indicated that the developed method yielded clay contents more consistent with other property data for the same horizons. Consequently, the textural classes obtained from the two methods were different. Therefore; we concluded that the determination of particle size distribution for gypsiferous soils (≤ 40 % gypsum) using this developed method will improve the understanding and ability to proper interpret of physical behavior of these unique soils.

The ability to differentiate between East and West Antarctic ice will allow us to constrain ice flow into the central Ross Sea during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which has implications for more accurate reconstructions of the Ross Ice Sheet and its behavior. Moraines sampled from the head of Reedy Glacier give insight to the geology beneath the EAIS, and may be representative of what the glacier is eroding from its bed. Samples along the trunk of the glacier capture representative rock types eroded along the length of Reedy Glacier. At each moraine 3 replicate sub-sites were selected for collection to represent the diversity of material within each moraine. Comparisons are based on the composition of pebbles, particle size distributions, and sand petrography. Analysis of the pebble fraction shows that each sub-site contains similar rock types, however, the concentration of each rock type varies as much as 25 - 35 %. Similar variation is also seen within the sub-site <b>sand</b> <b>fraction.</b> Both the pebble and <b>sand</b> <b>fraction</b> reflect the mapped bedrock geology. The dominant pebble types are coarse-grained felsic and intermediate igneous rocks, as well as quartzite. Similarly felsic igneous grains, quartzite, quartz, and feldspar characterize the <b>sand</b> <b>fraction.</b> Particle size analysis shows that v Reedy Glacier till averages 85 % sand. The subglacial West Antarctic samples contain approximately 30 % sand, and equal amounts of silt and clay, approximately 35 % each. An observation of the <b>sand</b> <b>fraction</b> from beneath the West Antarctic Ice Streams shows composition similar to tills from Reedy Glacier. However, tills from the base of the West Antarctic Ice Streams contain up to 75 % polymict grains, and in contrast, these grains are absent in the tills from Reedy Glacier.

40|$|Rotavirus is {{a leading}} cause of {{gastrointestinal}} illness worldwide. Rotavirus transmission occurs fecalorally, and becomes a critical water quality issue when soil and water resources are contaminated with feces. Transport of pathogens to surface water sources depends on their survival in the soil, especially considering the fact that large amounts of fecal material are often applied to agricultural lands as fertilizer. In this study, rotavirus survival was investigated in three different soil fractions and at three different temperatures (4 ℃, 25 ℃ and 37 ℃). A rotavirus suspension was mixed with whole soil, sand, and clay and allowed to incubate for up to 18 days. Samples were collected daily to investigate virus survival over time, which was quantified using a tissue-culture infectivity assay. Results indicated, {{in the absence of any}} soil particles, rotavirus survival was highest at 4 ℃, with survival decreasing as temperature increased. These data also indicated whole soil had some protective effect, allowing rotavirus to survive better in soil for the entire range of temperatures and for more than a week at 37 ℃. The results also showed that <b>sand</b> <b>fractions</b> were the most effective media for reducing rotavirus recovery at all temperature conditions tested. Although the mechanism responsible for the low recovery from sand is unknown, there is little or no infective rotavirus extracted from <b>sand</b> <b>fractions.</b> This finding strongly supports the use of sand as a filtering material to remove rotavirus from both point and nonpoint sources of water pollution. </p...|$|R
40|$|Zhao, P., Shao, M-a., Omran, W. and She, D. 2013. A {{modified}} {{model for}} estimating the full description of soil particle size distribution. Can. J. Soil Sci. 93 : 65 - 72. A full {{description of the}} particle size distribution (PSD) curve is widely used {{as a basis for}} estimating soil hydraulic properties. However, the incomplete experimental data of PSD sets (i. e., percent clay, silt, and sand) often limit its uses. In this study, an empirical model modified from the Weibull model was used to estimate the complete description PSD from clay, silt and <b>sand</b> <b>fractions.</b> Results show that the estimated distribution agrees reasonably well with the actual distribution for 168 soils samples studied within six different textures. The values of coefficients of determination, the average absolute deviation and the maximum absolute deviation were 98. 6 %, 3. 3 % and 12. 6 %, respectively. The modified model performed best for silt loam samples containing about 70 % silt content. The estimation accuracy varied with radii interval. For the estimated PSD curve, a 0. 05 - 0. 1 mm size interval was most poorly estimated and had the maximum deviation (28. 2 %), while the 0. 5 - 1 mm interval was estimated well by the modified model. The model is recommended to estimate complete soil PSD using only clay, silt and <b>sand</b> <b>fractions,</b> which can be well fitted by the Weibull model. Further studies are suggested to validate the PSD estimation by this model when applied to soils with greater variation in texture...|$|R
40|$|Small mountainous rivers, {{such as the}} Elwha River in Washington State, play a {{key role}} in the {{sedimentary}} processes that form and maintain the structure and function of their neighboring shorelines. The Elwha River was dammed from 1910 to 2011, and construction of the dams has been attributed to coarsening and erosion of its delta and adjacent shorelines. In turn, the habitat made available to marine organisms was altered for nearly 100 years. This study examined the median (D 50) of the grain sizes, <b>sand</b> <b>fractions,</b> and respective elevations of physical samples from the Elwha delta using dry and wet sieve methods, as well as average surface grain sizes using photographic methods, to evaluate the impacts of dam removal of the restoration and/or expansion of Pacific sand lance (sand lance) spawning habitat. Of the 34 physical samples collected and as of 12 and 13 April 2014, the findings suggest 10 sample locations west and 8 samples locations east of the river mouth met the three parameters documented as preferred sand lance spawning habitat. Each of the 18 locations within the study area had grain-size distributions with medians ranging between ~ 0. 2 and 2. 0 mm, the bulk <b>sand</b> <b>fractions</b> of each sample ranged between ~ 60 and 98 %, and their respective elevations were between + 1. 33 and + 2. 22 m MLLW. Potentially suitable spawning habitat for sand lance was found ~ 1, 230 m west and ~ 1, 500 m east of the river mouth...|$|R
