50|$|Employer {{payroll tax}} on high salariesFor tax years 2013 & 2014 {{earnings}} above 1 million euros {{will be subject}} to a tax payable by the payer/employer. The tax is similar to the employer social security contributions which above 1 million euros amount to 0.22% of gross salary compared to 44% for salaries of 150,000 euros. The tax introduced by Francois Hollande as the 75% tax is in fact an additional employer contribution of 50% which when existing <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>charges</b> are added reaches 75%. The proposed tax was subsequently modified after being rejected by the Council of State and was implemented in 2014 in its current form and will be discontinued as of January 2015.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to update}} {{findings}} previously published by CAF in 2006 around international comparisons of charitable giving, {{and to provide}} {{an analysis of the}} relationship between GDP, tax and giving within a number of countries. The {{purpose of this paper is}} not to provide all the answers but merely to act as a document which will hopefully stimulate further discussion and understanding around this important issue. Throughout, it should be borne in mind that we have conducted the analysis amongst 24 countries. The key findings from this analysis of 24 countries are: The top four countries in terms of charitable giving by individuals as a percentage of GDP are the United States of America, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom. Generosity is not restricted to the Western economies analysed, showing that giving can be a global phenomenon. Two of the BRICS countries (Russia and India) appear in the Top 10 of countries analysed, indicating the potential of transitional economies to be future leaders in providing charitable resources. There is no significant correlation between levels of taxation and government spending and the amount given to charity across all taxes looked at, with the exception of employer <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>charges.</b> There is a correlation between charitable giving and other aspects of giving such as volunteering time and helping a stranger backing up other data sources which have shown that those who volunteer their time are more likely to give monetarily to charity...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the Swedish tax relief legislation in effect as of 1 January 2001. As {{a result of}} intensified international trade and transfers of technology, combined with greater labor mobility, globalization is putting pressure on countries to promote themselves as attractive locations for foreign investments. This is most easily done by reducing the tax rates - thus the phenomenon of international tax competition. The Swedish tax relief legislation, meant to make Swedish companies’ more competitive on the global labor market, {{is only one of}} several similar legislations in other European countries. By providing additional advantage to companies needing foreign expertise for their Swedish operations the Government hoped to retain or establish top executive functions in Sweden. The legislation provides several benefits for foreign key personnel the first three years in Sweden. Not only is there a 25 % reduction of taxable income, but these individuals will be able to receive tax-exempt reimbursements of moving expenses, home leave (twice a year), and school fees for children. On these tax-exempts, no <b>social</b> <b>security</b> <b>charges</b> will be levied. There are three categories of personnel eligible for tax relief - experts, scientists and other foreign key personnel. A criteria set up for the two first groups is that the foreigner's skills or talents are impossible or at least extremely difficult to recruit in Sweden. The questions asked are what the hopes where, if the legislation has actually lived up to the expectations and weather or not the companies have found the handling times acceptable. To find answers to my questions I have interviewed four of Sweden’s major export-companies, as well as one of Sweden’s largest accounting firm. My conclusion is that the new legislation has not fully lived up to its objectives {{and there seems to be}} a discontent with the fall out of the Swedish taw relief. The handling times are much to long, sometimes to the extent that the foreign key person has left the country long before the authorities have been able to produce a final decision. Not one of those subject to my questions believes that the legislation has given them a stronger position on the international labour market or facilitated the recruitment of foreign expertise. Once granted, the tax relief does lead to a very favorable taxation. But the uncertainty surrounding the rules is way too extensive and the risk of having the granted tax relief taken away by a court decision makes the legislation a fairly blunt tool for recruitment and a not strong enough incentive for foreign investments...|$|E

40|$|With {{the dawn}} of democracy, the South African <b>social</b> <b>security</b> system was {{in dire need of}} change. The right of access to <b>social</b> <b>security</b> was for the first time entrenched as a {{fundamental}} right in the 1995 Constitution. Since then, many changes have been effected to the present formal <b>social</b> <b>security</b> system, but these were mostly ad hoc and lacked a comprehensive approach. The past history of the country led to the exclusion {{of the majority of the}} population from formal <b>social</b> <b>security</b> protection. The excluded and marginalised had to rely on informal <b>social</b> <b>security</b> measures to provide social protection. This resulted in a system of co-existence between formal and informal <b>social</b> <b>security.</b> Although informal <b>social</b> <b>security</b> is increasingly recognised as part of the <b>social</b> <b>security</b> landscape, the role and importance of informal <b>social</b> <b>security</b> have largely been ignored in all reforms to improve the protective scope of the present <b>social</b> <b>security</b> system. The thesis aims to change this. Informal <b>social</b> <b>security</b> has been denied a rightful place in the South African <b>social</b> <b>security</b> landscape.
