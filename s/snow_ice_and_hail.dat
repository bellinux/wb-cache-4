50|$|The {{traditional}} rules {{regarding the}} construction of a mikveh are based on those specified in classical rabbinical literature. According to these rules, a mikveh must be connected to a natural spring or well of naturally occurring water, and thus can be supplied by rivers and lakes which have natural springs as their source. A cistern filled by the rain is also permitted to act as a mikveh's water supply. Similarly <b>snow,</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> <b>hail</b> are allowed to act as the supply of water to a mikveh, as long as it melts in a certain manner. A river that dries up on a regular basis cannot be used because it is presumed to be mainly rainwater, which cannot purify while flowing. Oceans for the most part have the status of natural springs.|$|E
40|$|A rooftop {{photovoltaic}} array {{has been}} designed for the George C. Gordon library at WPI. The photovoltaic array {{is made up of}} 96 Evergreen Solar photovoltaic modules tilted at 27 degrees and oriented along the southern face of the library rooftop. This configuration is expected to produce over 27, 000 kWh annually and offset over 56, 000 lbs carbon dioxide emissions that would have otherwise been generated from conventional power generation. This solar array designed to meet the electrical needs of the library. It is also designed to be connected to the electrical grid so that extra power produced is fed into the grid. A performance analysis of this photovoltaic system design is presented. The performance analysis assumes that WPI is awarded the following federal and state incentives which were available in 2009 :  30 % grant from the U. S. Department of Treasury  25 % grant from the U. S. Department of Agriculture  30 % federal tax credit  $ 162, 500 grant from the Massachusetts Solar Stimulus Based on the above incentives and assuming WPI pays {{for the remainder of the}} photovoltaic system upfront, the calculated payback period is 1. 5 years. The system is expected to last 25 - 30 years, which makes this system a very valuable investment. An important part of the design of the photovoltaic system is to ensure that the photovoltaic modules and mounting system will withstand environmental loads common to Worcester, MA such as wind, <b>snow,</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> <b>hail.</b> Structural analysis using ANSYS™ simulation software is presented in this thesis for a variety of commercial photovoltaic modules and two different mounting systems: attached and ballasted. Attached mounting systems are drilled into the roofing material whereas ballasted mounting systems are placed on the roof and weighed down with concrete blocks. The structural analysis proves that the Evergreen Solar photovoltaic modules will withstand these structural loads and reveals that an attached mounting system has higher performance than a ballasted mounting system under the same loading conditions. Another important aspect of photovoltaic system design is the effect of photovoltaic module operating temperature on the performance of the system. It is well known that the performance of the system will decrease as the operating temperature increases. In this thesis, a thermal analysis of three different photovoltaic modules was completed and the temperature map generated from the ANSYS™ simulation software was used to observe the structural effects of temperature changes and to develop a correlation of the operating temperature to system performance. The most important result of this analysis shows that the Evergreen Solar photovoltaic module will have higher performance in the Worcester climate than other photovoltaic materials such as cadmium telluride. WPI has recognized the need for improving campus environmental performance and has formed a Presidential Task Force to engage the WPI community in sustainability. One of the main objectives is to increase energy conservation on campus. Implementing a photovoltaic system on the library rooftop will not only increase clean energy and decrease carbon emissions on campus. it would also bring general awareness to the state, city, and college community of the advantages of the use of photovoltaic energy in New England. This array will also provide the opportunity for future student project work on the performance and maintenance of the system...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the heavy}} {{rainfall}} that {{was associated with}} severe weather events (e. g., typhoons, local heavy precipitation events) has caused significant damages {{in the economy and}} loss of human life throughout Taiwan. Especially, the extreme heavy rainfall (over 2500 mm over 24 hours) associated with Typhoon Morakot 2009 caused more than 600 human beings lost and more than $ 100 million US dollar damage. In this paper, we are using WRF to simulate the precipitation processes associated Typhoon Morakot 2009. The preliminary results indicated that the wrf model with using 2 km grid size and with utilizing the 310 E scheme (cloud <b>ice,</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> <b>hail)</b> can simulate more than 2500 mm rainfall over 24 hour integration. In this talk, we will evaluate the performance of the microphysical schemes for the Typhoon Morakot case.

40|$|An aqueous {{chemistry}} module {{is created}} and included into a complex 3 D cloud-resolving mesoscale ARPS model {{to examine the}} characteristics of in-cloud sulfate. The complex orography of Serbia {{is included in the}} model. The chemical species included in the module are sulfur dioxide, sulfate ion, ammonium ion, hydrogen peroxide and ozone. Six water categories are considered: water vapor, cloud water, rain, cloud <b>ice,</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> <b>hail.</b> Each chemical species in each microphysical category is represented by a differential equation of mass continuity. This paper gives {{a detailed description of the}} chemistry module and demonstrates the utility of an atmospheric model coupled with the chemistry module in forecasting the redistribution of chemical species in all water categories. The main mean microphysical and chemical conversion rates of sulfate averaged over a 2 h simulation period for a base run are for the oxidation of S(IV) in rain water and cloud water, SO 4 2 − scavenging by Brownian diffusion in cloud droplets <b>and</b> cloud <b>ice</b> as well as the impact scavenging of SO 4 2 − by rain.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{numerical}} weather and global non-hydrostatic models have started using more complex microphysical schemes originally developed for high resolution cloud resolving models (CRMs) with 1 - 2 km or less horizontal resolutions. These microphysical schemes affect the dynamic through {{the release of}} latent heat (buoyancy loading and pressure gradient) the radiation through the cloud coverage (vertical distribution of cloud species), and surface processes through rainfall (both amount and intensity). Recently, several major improvements of ice microphysical processes (or schemes) {{have been developed for}} cloud-resolving model (Goddard Cumulus Ensemble, GCE, model) and regional scale (Weather Research and Forecast, WRF) model. These improvements include an improved 3 -ICE (cloud <b>ice,</b> <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> graupel) scheme (Lang et al. 2010); a 4 -ICE (cloud <b>ice,</b> <b>snow,</b> graupel <b>and</b> <b>hail)</b> scheme <b>and</b> a spectral bin microphysics scheme and two different two-moment microphysics schemes. The performance of these schemes has been evaluated by using observational data from TRMM and other major field campaigns. In this talk, we will present the high-resolution (1 km) GeE and WRF model simulations and compared the simulated model results with observation from recent field campaigns [i. e., midlatitude continental spring season (MC 3 E; 2010), high latitude cold-season (C 3 VP, 2007; GCPEx, 2012), and tropical oceanic (TWP-ICE, 2006) ]...|$|R

The model shows that sea-ice formation occurs {{both at the}} <b>ice</b> bottom <b>and</b> at the snow/ice interface. Modelling {{results indicated that the}} total <b>snow</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> superimposed <b>ice,</b> which formed at the snow/ice interface, was about 14 cm during the simulation period, accounting for about 15 % of the total <b>ice</b> mass <b>and</b> 35 % of the total ice growth. Introducing a time-dependent snow density improved the modelled results, and a time-dependent oceanic heat flux parameterization yielded reasonable ice growth at the ice bottom. Model results suggest that weather conditions, in particular air temperature and precipitation, as well as snow thermal properties and surface albedo are the most critical factors for the development of <b>snow</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> superimposed <b>ice</b> in Kongsfjorden. While both warming air and higher precipitation led to increased <b>snow</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> superimposed <b>ice</b> forming in Kongsfjorden in the model runs, the processes were more sensitive to precipitation than to air temperature...|$|R
