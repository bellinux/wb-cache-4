50|$|The saola, siola, Vu Quang ox, <b>spindlehorn,</b> or Asian bicorn, also, infrequently, Vu Quang bovid (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis), {{is one of}} the world's rarest large mammals, a forest-dwelling bovine {{found only}} in the Annamite Range of Vietnam and Laos. Related to cattle, goats, and antelopes, the species was defined {{following}} a discovery of remains in 1992 in Vũ Quang Nature Reserve by a joint survey of the Vietnamese Ministry of Forestry and the World Wide Fund for Nature. Saolas have since been kept in captivity multiple times, although only for short periods. A living saola in the wild was first photographed in 1999 by a camera trap set by WWF and the Vietnamese government’s Forest Protection Department (SFNC).|$|E
