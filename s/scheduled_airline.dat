5|$|Congestion pricing {{has also}} been {{implemented}} for <b>scheduled</b> <b>airline</b> services. The British Airports Authority (BAA) has been a pioneer in implementing congestion pricing {{for all types of}} commercial aviation. In 1972 implemented the first peak pricing policy, with surcharges varying depending on the season and time of the day, and by 1976 raised these peak charges. London-Heathrow had seven pricing structures between 1976 and 1984. In this case it was the US carriers that went to international arbitration in 1988 and won their case.|$|E
5|$|She {{made her}} last film at MGM {{starring}} with Bob Hope in Bachelor in Paradise (1961), which received mostly positive critical reception. Turner's projects of this era include By Love Possessed (1961), {{based on the}} James Gould Cozzens novel. On July 19, 1961, it became the first in-flight movie to be shown {{on a regular basis}} on a <b>scheduled</b> <b>airline</b> flight, by Trans World Airlines (TWA) to its first-class passengers. Other highlights of this period include two Hunter productions (for whom she did Imitation of Life), Portrait in Black (1960), a box office success, co-starring Anthony Quinn and Sandra Dee, and Madame X (1966), which proved to be her last major starring role.|$|E
5|$|When the U.S. entered World War II {{at the end}} of 1941, Lombard {{traveled}} to her home state of Indiana for a war bond rally with her mother, Bess Peters, and Clark Gable's press agent, Otto Winkler. Lombard was able to raise over $2 million ($35 million in 2016) in defense bonds in a single evening. Her party had initially been scheduled to return to Los Angeles by train, but Lombard was anxious to reach home more quickly and wanted to fly by a <b>scheduled</b> <b>airline.</b> Her mother and Winkler were both afraid of flying and insisted they follow their original travel plans. Lombard suggested they flip a coin; they agreed and Lombard won the toss.|$|E

5|$|By 1967 {{reconstruction}} {{began at}} the airport, adding three new concourses with 28 gates and three ticket counters, and in 1968 the city invested $10million in renovation funds. (For a few months during the 1967 renovation Midway had no <b>scheduled</b> <b>airline</b> flights.) The funds partly supported construction of the Stevenson Expressway, and Midway saw the return of major airlines that year, with 1,663,074 passengers on smaller-capacity, shorter range twin-jet and trijet airliners such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-9, BAC One-Eleven, Boeing 727, and Boeing 737 that could use Midway's runways, which the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 could not. In May 1968 there were 22 scheduled departures: six United 727s to MSP, DCA and LGA, 12 Northwest 727s to MSP and CLE, one Delta DC-9 to STL and three Ozark FH227s.|$|E
5|$|Jet Airways was {{incorporated}} as a {{limited liability company}} on 1 April 1992. It started operations as an air taxi operator on 5 May 1993 with a fleet of four leased Boeing 737-300 aircraft. The airline was granted a <b>scheduled</b> <b>airline</b> status on 14 January 1995. On 12 May 1994, all the shares were transferred to Tailwinds International, whose equity capital was held by Naresh Goyal (60%), Gulf Air (20%) and Kuwait Airways (20%). In October 1997, as per the directive of Ministry of Civil Aviation forbidding foreign investment in passenger airlines, Goyal {{took control of the}} entire company. The airline launched its first international flight in March 2004 from Chennai to Colombo. The company was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and became public company on 28 December 2004, with Goyal retaining 51% ownership of the stock.|$|E
5|$|The April 1957 OAG shows 414 weekday {{fixed-wing}} {{departures from}} Midway: 83 American, 83 United, 56 TWA, 40 Capital, 35 North Central, 28 Delta, 27 Eastern, 22 Northwest, 19 Ozark, 11 Braniff, 5 Trans-Canada, and 5 Lake Central. Air France, Lufthansa, and REAL (of Brazil) {{had a few}} flights per week. Midway {{was running out of}} room and in any case could not handle the 707 and DC-8 jets that appeared in 1959; every Chicago jet flight had to use O'Hare, which had opened to the airlines in 1955. Electras and Viscounts could have continued to fly out of Midway, but O'Hare's capacious new terminal opened in 1962, allowing airlines to consolidate their flights. From July 1962 until United returned in July 1964, Midway's only <b>scheduled</b> <b>airline</b> was Chicago Helicopter. In August 1966 a total of four fixed-wing arrivals were scheduled, all United 727s (United was alone at Midway until early 1968).|$|E

Blair, an immensely popular figure, {{was a pioneer}} of transatlantic aviation, a former brigadier general of the US Air Force, a former chief pilot at Pan Am, and founder {{and head of the}} U.S. Virgin Islands airline Antilles Air Boats. A few years after her {{marriage}} to Blair, O'Hara, for the most part, retired from acting. In the special features section to the DVD release of The Quiet Man, a story is recounted that O'Hara retired after longtime collaborators John Wayne and John Ford teased her about being married but not being a good, stay-at-home housewife, though Blair himself wanted her to retire from acting and help run his business. Blair died in 1978 while flying a Grumman Goose for his airline from St. Croix to St. Thomas, crashing after an engine failure. O'Hara was elected CEO and president of the airline, with the added distinction of becoming the first woman president of a <b>scheduled</b> <b>airline</b> in the U.S.|$|E
