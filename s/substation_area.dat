The <b>substation</b> <b>area</b> protection and control device collects local {{area protection}} information and sends out control commands directly, for instance, without local area protection. Local area protection function is realized without depending on <b>substation</b> <b>area</b> and wide area protection and control systems, but executes necessary information exchange. Local area bay protection, <b>substation</b> <b>area</b> protection, and wide area protection and control are combined organically to form a complete hierarchical protection and control system, which not only guarantees the independence, reliability, and quick operation of bay protection, but also uses <b>substation</b> <b>area</b> and wide area protection and control {{to solve the problems}} of relay protection for traditional substations, and improve protection performance and control capability of system security and stability.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to determine electrical network cost and cost structure depending on load density. Load density together with a defined customer mix directly determines the supply task, i. e., the number of connection points and their density in a geographical area {{as well as their}} load profiles. Load density indirectly determines the construction conditions since higher load density means a higher building efficiency which in turn leads to restrictions in land use and more strict structural requirements. The applied methodology adopts features from several engineering-economic approaches with the three basic steps: (1) Description of the supply task including relevant characteristics of the service area. (2) Network generation. Linear approximations of cost functions for lines and substations are used together with geometrical models of symmetrical and homogeneous load dispersion to determine optimal substation spacings. (3) Monetary assessment of the generated asset structure including operational and maintenance costs. The cost-effects of different external cost-drivers are incorporated into the applied cost functions. All network levels from low voltage connections up to EHV substations are included. Additionally, reliability indices are determined for the model network sample feeders with different mitigation strategies. Actual <b>substation</b> service <b>areas</b> are used as references to the calculated results. Additionally, based on the connection point data of these reference <b>substation</b> <b>areas,</b> another reference medium voltage network is created using an optimization algorithm developed at Helsinki University of Technology, Department of Electrical Engineering. Using the model network approach, cost is determined for networks in rural, suburban, urban and urban core zones. The cost structure and level varies from zone to zone depending on the allowed equipment, share of open space and customer mix. When moving towards the highest load densities in urban and urban core areas, the cost lowering caused by higher connection point density is attenuated due to the higher unit cost of equipment. The created analytic and geometric network model, even with massive simplifications, is proven suitable for estimating the network volume and cost for different zones and load densities. The applied methodology forms a qualified framework for further development of the model network approach...|$|R

40|$|The service {{areas for}} {{electric}} power substations {{can be estimated}} using a Cellular Automata (CA) model. The CA model is a discrete, iterative process whereby <b>substations</b> acquire service <b>area</b> by claiming neighboring cells. The service area expands from a substation until a neighboring <b>substation</b> service <b>area</b> is met or the substation`s total capacity or other constraints are reached. The CA-model output {{is dependent on the}} rule set that defines cell interactions. The rule set is based on a hierarchy of quantitative metrics that represent real-world factors such as land use and population density. Together, the metrics determine the rate of cell acquisition and the upper bound for service area size. Assessing the CA-model accuracy requires comparisons to actual service areas. These actual service areas can be extracted from distribution maps. Quantitative assessment of the CA-model accuracy can be accomplished by a number of methods. Some are as simple as finding the percentage of cells predicted correctly, while others assess a penalty based on the distance from an incorrectly predicted cell to its correct service area. This is an initial report of a work in progress...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{absorbs the}} {{advantage}} of hot backup in information field. Then, an all-in-one device based distributed <b>substation</b> <b>area</b> protection framework is proposed. Point-to-point model and VLAN based network-to network model are adopted in this framework. Dual redundancy on hardware and software level is realized by modularization, protection information mirroring storage and overwriting, which avoids the risk of single point failure of internal components effectively. On this basis, a distributed cooperative all-in-one device cluster based <b>substation</b> <b>area</b> joint defensive protection strategy is proposed. The proposed strategy can overcome the sampling, logic judgment and information transmission processes of protection may be mistaken by the atrocious conditions, and form a strong intelligent secondary device integrated network. EPOCHS based simulation examples verify the validity and rationality of the proposed architecture and strategy. If the secondary device is provided with adequate environmental reliability, the research of this paper will provide an excellent foundation for integration of primary and secondary device.|$|E

30|$|If the {{previous}} scheme designs of <b>substation</b> <b>area</b> protection and wide area protection are adopted directly {{to address the}} need, there will be lots of problems in suitability and reliability. Mounts of previous works focused on substation protection. A novel reliability modeling and analysis methodology were proposed in [5] for modern substation protection systems. An integrated control and protection system are proposed in [6] with a hierarchical coordination control strategy. In [7], a substation backup protection scheme based on multiple limitedly overlapped divisions was proposed. In general, the integrated protection or the <b>substation</b> <b>area</b> protection usually acts as back-up protection of substation, especially in high voltage systems. However, the reliability {{of this type of}} structure is still in doubt, related technologies and strategies cannot directly apply to such a design that integrates the primary equipment and secondary device into an entity. Although seldom adopted in <b>substation</b> <b>area</b> protection, the distributed protection mode is widely accepted in the field of wide area protection. In [8], a study of communication was presented based on wide area agents for primary and backup coordinated protection. A multi-agent based adaptive wide area current differential protection system was proposed in [9]. In [10], a faulted element identification algorithm was proposed based on multisource information fusion for wide area protection. A novel wide area backup protection algorithm was presented in [11] using information shared across wide area communication networks. In [12], a multi-agent system based wide area protection and control scheme was proposed to deal with the long-term voltage instability induced cascading trips. The researches on distributed protection are valuable for the integration of primary or secondary devices and for that an agent or a distributed unit works in the same way in the wide area or the <b>substation</b> <b>area.</b> However, the intelligent secondary devices designed to be placed in substation master control room cannot well match the life span of primary devices. Besides, their adaptation for strong electromagnetic interference and atrocious operation environment is yet to be testified [13]. Therefore, there are lots of problems in feasibility and reliability of the integration of primary device and secondary device in the same equipment.|$|E
