40|$|Indeterminate thyroid nodules include {{heterogeneous}} lesions {{that could}} benefit from a differential management. Our aim is to better define {{the management of the}} Bethesda <b>System</b> <b>for</b> Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology class III and IV nodules, by identifying cytological subcategories among Bethesda <b>System</b> <b>for</b> Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology class III associated with different clinical risk, by means of ultrasound, repeated FNAB, and BRAFV 600 E molecular analysis. We also evaluated the outcome of nodules not operated, over a 5 -year follow-up. Out of 460 nodules (269 Bethesda <b>System</b> <b>for</b> Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology class III and 191 Bethesda <b>System</b> <b>for</b> Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology class IV), 344 were operated on surgical group and 116 followed-up conservatively (follow-up group). Bethesda <b>System</b> <b>for</b> Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology class III was divided into four subcategories on the basis of cytomorphological features (III- 1, III- 2, III- 3, III- 4). Clinical risk was defined on the basis of histological, cytological, and ultrasound data. Malignancy was higher in Bethesda <b>System</b> <b>for</b> Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology class III vs. Bethesda <b>System</b> <b>for</b> Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology class IV (34. 4 vs. 26. 2 %; p < 0. 01). Papillary thyroid carcinoma was the most frequent cancer in each Bethesda <b>System</b> <b>for</b> Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology class (35 %). BRAFV 600 E diagnostic accuracy was 87 %. Repeated FNAB reclassified as benign nearly 40 % of nodules, selecting patients where surgery could be spared. Significant nodule growth occurred in 13. 7 % of nodules, belonging mostly to Bethesda <b>System</b> <b>for</b> Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology class III- 2 and Bethesda <b>System</b> <b>for</b> Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology class IV. Overall clinical risk was higher in Bethesda <b>System</b> <b>for</b> Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology III- 1, III- 4, and IV classes. We propose a differential management of Bethesda <b>System</b> <b>for</b> Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology III and IV classes and related subcategories: surgery may be indicated in Bethesda <b>System</b> <b>for</b> Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology class III- 1, III- 4, and IV; a conservative follow-up avoiding repeated FNAB may be appropriated in class III- 3, while repeated FNAB may be useful in class III- 2...|$|R
