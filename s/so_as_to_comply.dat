The all-new Debonair adopted a front-wheel drive format, a cost-effective way to increase interior space without investing money on engineering in an executive sedan. It also came with Mitsubishi's first V6 engines, the 6G71 2.0L and the 6G72 3.0L under the [...] "Cyclone" [...] moniker, which were shared with the Galant model line later. <b>So</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>comply</b> with Japanese government regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement, vehicles installed with the 2.0 L engine were installed in a shorter and narrower car - accomplished simply by fitting smaller bumpers.

There is a growing worldwide trend for countries to implement whole-of-life traceability systems for livestock, and RFID is clearly the dominant technology being chosen to achieve this aim. In line with this global trend, and {{to meet the requirements}} of key trading partners (such as the EU), Australia has implemented the National Livestock Identification System (NLlS) to provide whole-of-life traceability for Iivestock - a system based on the use of RFID devices. As such, it is proposed that dairy farmers utilise RFID <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> not only <b>comply</b> with NLIS requirements, but to extend the use of RFID onto their farms <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> provide additional benefits for themselves through subsequent enhancements in farm management practices...|$|R
