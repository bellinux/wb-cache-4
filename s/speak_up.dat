5|$|The {{accident}} {{has since}} become {{a prime example of}} successful crew resource management. For much of aviation's history, the captain was considered the final authority, and crews were to respect the captain's expertise and not question him. This began to change in the 1970s, especially after the Tenerife airport disaster. Crew Resource Management, while still considering the captain the final authority, instructs crewmembers to <b>speak</b> <b>up</b> when they detect a problem, and instructs captains to listen to their concerns. United Airlines instituted a Crew Resource Management class in the early 1980s. The NTSB would later credit this training as valuable toward the success of United 232's crew in handling their emergency. The FAA made Crew Resource Training mandatory {{in the aftermath of the}} accident.|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of team communication, or more specifically <b>speaking</b> <b>up,</b> for safeguarding quality {{of patient care}} is increasingly being endorsed in research findings. However, {{little is known about}} <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> of clinical teachers in postgraduate medical training. In order to determine how clinical teachers demonstrate <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> in formal teaching team meetings and what factors influence this, the authors carried out an exploratory study based on ethnographic principles. The authors selected 12 teaching teams and observed, audio recorded and analysed the data. Subsequently, during an interview, the program directors reflected on <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> of those clinical teachers present during the meeting. Finally, the authors analysed iteratively all data, using a template analysis, based on Edmondson's behaviours of <b>speaking</b> <b>up.</b> The study was conducted from October 2013 to July 2014 and ten teams participated. During the teaching team meetings, the clinical teachers exhibited most of the behaviours of <b>speaking</b> <b>up.</b> "Sharing information" strongly resembles providing information and "talking about mistakes" occurs in a general sense and without commitment of improvement activities. "Asking questions" was often displayed by closed questions and at times several questions simultaneously. The authors identified factors that influence <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> by clinical teachers: relational, cultural, and professional. The clinical teachers exhibit <b>speaking</b> <b>up,</b> but there is only limited awareness to discuss problems or mistakes and the discussion centred mainly on the question of blame. It is important {{to take into account the}} factors that influence <b>speaking</b> <b>up,</b> in order to stimulate open communication during the teaching team meeting...|$|R

40|$|Background Joint Commission {{predicted}} that 80 % {{of the serious}} safety events were occurring due to miscommunications between professionals. Speaking up {{is one of the}} critical behaviors of patient safety that display an important role for improving quality and patient safety in healthcare. Objectives Objectives of this study are assessing the effectiveness of <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> for patient safety, identifying the influencing factors of <b>speaking</b> <b>up,</b> evaluating the effectiveness of <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> training and finding enablers of <b>speaking</b> <b>up.</b> Methods This study was done to identify literature about ‘speaking up’ behaviors to improve safety outcomes via considering both patient and provider perspectives. PubMed was used to find English articles that relevant to both patient and provider’s <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> behaviors that mainly focused to demonstrate its impact on patient safety outcomes. Data was extracted and analyzed to find influencing factors and recommended voicing up behavior that display important role for improvement in quality and safety of healthcare. Results 53 relevant articles were identified in 83 articles. Those 53 articles consist of 4 literature reviews, 3 RCTs, 8 cohorts, 1 case control, 34 cross sectional studies and 3 reports. This study is the first study about not just identifying factors that influencing <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> behaviors among providers but also including factors of patients’ voicing up behaviors for safety. This study is also providing some ‘enablers of <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> behaviors’ which may help healthcare leaders and professionals’ decision making process for quality and safety improvements in their organization. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Our goal in {{this study}} was to test the {{relationship}} between speaking up-i. e., questioning, correcting, or clarifying a current procedure-and technical team performance in anesthesia. Hypothesis 1 : team members' higher levels of <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> are related to higher levels of technical team performance. Hypothesis 2 : team members will react to <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> by either clarifying their procedure or initiating a procedural change. Hypothesis 3 : higher levels of <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> during an earlier phase of teamwork will be related to higher levels of <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> during a later phase. METHODS: This prospective observational study involved 2 -person ad hoc anesthesia teams performing simulated inductions of general anesthesia with minor nonroutine events (e. g., bradycardia) in a large teaching hospital. Subjects were registered anesthesia nurses and residents. Each team consisted of 1 nurse and 1 resident. Synchronized video and vital parameter recordings were obtained. Two trained observers blinded to the hypotheses coded <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> and further team communication and coordination behavior on the basis of 12 distinct categories. All teamwork measures were quantified as percentage of total time spent on the respective teamwork category. Two experienced staff anesthesiologists blinded to the hypotheses evaluated technical team performance using a Delphi-validated rating checklist. Hypotheses 1 and 3 were tested using linear regression with residents' and nurses' levels of <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> as 2 separate predictor variables. Hypothesis 2 was analyzed using lag sequential analysis, resulting in Z values representing {{the extent to which the}} observed value for a conditional transition significantly differs from its unconditional value. RESULTS: Thirty-one nurses and 31 residents participated. Technical team performance could be predicted by the level of <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> from nurses (R(2) = 0. 18, P = 0. 017) but not from residents (R(2) = 0. 19, P = 0. 053); this result supports Hypothesis 1 for nurses. Supporting Hypothesis 2, residents reacted to <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> with clarifying the procedure by providing information (Z = 18. 08, P < 0. 001), initiating procedural change by giving instructions (Z = 4. 74, P < 0. 001) and team member monitoring (Z = 3, P = 0. 0013). Likewise, nurses reacted with clarifying the procedure by providing or evaluating information (Z = 16. 09, P < 0. 001; Z = 3. 72, P < 0. 001) and initiating procedural change by providing assistance (Z = 0. 57, P < 0. 001). Indicating a trend for Hypothesis 3, nurses' level of <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> before intubation predicted their level of <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> during intubation (R(2) = 0. 15, P = 0. 034), although this did not reach the Bonferroni-corrected significance level of P = 0. 025. No respective relationship was found for residents (R(2) = 0. 15, P = 0. 096). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence and shows mechanisms for the positive relationship between speaking-up behavior and technical team performance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{learning in}} interdisciplinary action teams. Research on team effectiveness has {{focused primarily on}} single-discipline teams engaged in routine production tasks and, less often, on interdisciplinary teams engaged in discussion and management rather than action. The resulting models are of limited use for explaining differences in learning in interdisciplinary action teams. Members of these teams must coordinate action in uncertain, fast-paced situations, {{and the extent to}} which they are comfortable <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> with observations, questions, and concerns may be critical to team outcomes. To explore what leaders of action teams do to promote <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> and other learning processes, as well as how organizational context may affect team learning outcomes, I analyze data from 16 operating room teams learning to use a new technology for cardiac surgery. Team leader coaching, <b>speaking</b> <b>up,</b> and boundary spanning combined to facilitate successful technology implementation. The most effective team leaders helped teams learn by communicating a motivating sense of purpose for shifting to the new technology and by framing the learning process as a teamwork rather than technical challenge, thereby minimizing concerns about status differences and promoting <b>speaking</b> <b>up</b> in the service of learning.

In addition to the problems caused by states rights, Escott also emphasizes that the widespread opposition to any strong central government combined with the vast difference in wealth between the slave-owning class and the small farmers created insolvable dilemmas when the Confederate survival presupposed a strong central government backed by a united populace. The prewar claim that white solidarity was necessary to provide a unified Southern voice in Washington no longer held. Davis failed to build a network of supporters who would <b>speak</b> <b>up</b> when he came under criticism, and he repeatedly alienated governors and other state-based leaders by demanding centralized control of the war effort.|$|E
