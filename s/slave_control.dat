50|$|Slave patrols {{first began}} in South Carolina in 1704 and spread {{throughout}} the thirteen colonies, lasting well beyond the American Revolution. As the population of black slaves boomed, especially with {{the invention of the}} cotton gin, so did the fear of slave resistance and uprisings. Its development began when other means of <b>slave</b> <b>control</b> failed to instill <b>slave</b> <b>control</b> and obedience. Their biggest concern were slaves on the plantations since that is where slave populations were highest. At first, incentives such as tobacco and money were offered to urge whites to be more vigilant in the capture of runaway slaves. When this approach failed, slave patrols were formally established. Laws were put into place to regulate the activities of both blacks and whites. Slaves who were encountered without passes were expected to be returned to their owners, as stated in the slave code. Punishment for runaway slaves could be expected. Black persons were subjected to questioning, searches, and other forms of harassment. Oftentimes, whippings and beatings for non-compliant, and even compliant slaves, could be expected. More than floggings and beatings, however, slaves feared the threat of being placed on the auction block and being separated from their families. If caught by patrols and returned to their masters, being placed on the auction block was an option for masters who no longer wanted to deal with their non-compliant slaves. During these times, slaves were often neglected and mistreated despite having permission to travel.|$|E

50|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, {{each of the}} states {{maintained}} its militia differently, some more than others. Prior to the Civil War, militia units were sometimes used by southern states for <b>slave</b> <b>control.</b> Formed in 1860, Republican Party-affiliated Wide Awakes clubs were quick {{to take action to}} defend persons against southern slave-hunters. In California, the militia carried out campaigns against bandits and against the Indians at the direction of its Governor between 1850 and 1866. During Reconstruction after the Civil War, Republican state governments had militias composed almost entirely of freed slaves and populist whites. Their deployment to maintain order in the former Confederate states caused increased resentment among many Southern whites.|$|E

50|$|Runaway {{communities}} {{flourished in}} almost all areas of Bahia, whose geography aided escape, {{and the result was}} a great number of fugitives and mocambos.In plantation zones, slaves often made up over 60 percent of the inhabitants. They lived in bad conditions in terms of food and housing and they had to deal with particularly cruel or sadistic masters. The region of Bahia in which appeared a great quantity of mocambos was the southern towns of Cairù, Camamù and Ilhéus. In these towns there was the most part of the production of manioc, the basic subsistence crop of Brazil.A second and still unstudied method of <b>slave</b> <b>control</b> and capture in Brazil was the calculated use of Indians as slave catchers and as a counterforce to mocambos and possible slave resorts.|$|E

30|$|The master <b>slave</b> <b>control</b> and {{hierarchical}} {{secondary control}} [12, 17] require high bandwidth communication {{and is only}} effective when the loads and sources are closely connected. Implementation of power sharing in a droop controlled DC MG is achieved by reducing the voltage reference {{with an increase in}} output current [17]. This decentralized control approach without high bandwidth communication compared to master <b>slave</b> <b>control</b> is suitable for DC MG [18]. However, it has the disadvantage of output current sharing accuracy resulted by voltage drop across line impedance [12]. Another disadvantage of droop control is voltage deviation, resulted by the reduction of DC output voltage [19].|$|E
