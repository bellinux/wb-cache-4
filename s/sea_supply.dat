5|$|Peng {{was still}} in command of China's armed forces when Mao ordered the {{shelling}} of Jinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu, islands {{off the coast of}} Fujian that were still held by the Kuomintang, in the late summer and autumn of 1958. Peng developed a strategy with his Chief of Staff, Su Yu, to bombard the islands so intensely that the morale of their defenders would collapse, eventually leading to the islands' surrender. After the islands' surrender, the PLA would then use the islands to launch attacks against Taiwan. The saturated shelling of the islands included over half the artillery in China, and began on August 28. The attack included a coordinated effort to cut off the islands' air and <b>sea</b> <b>supply</b> lines.|$|E
25|$|On 11 December, General Wavell {{ordered the}} 4th Indian Infantry Division to {{withdraw}} from Operation Compass {{to take part in}} an offensive against Italian forces in Italian East Africa alongside the 5th Indian Infantry Division. Both divisions faced vastly superior Italian forces (ten divisions in total) that threatened the Red <b>Sea</b> <b>supply</b> routes to Egypt as well as Egypt and the Suez Canal itself. The East African campaign culminated in March 1941 with a British victory in the Battle of Keren.|$|E
25|$|Arriving in Burma {{just in time}} to {{experience}} the collapse of the Allied defense of that country, which cut China off from all land and <b>sea</b> <b>supply</b> routes, Stilwell personally led his staff of 117 men and women out of Burma into Assam, India on foot, marching at what his men called the 'Stilwell stride' – 105 paces per minute. Two of the men accompanying him, his aide Frank Dorn and the war correspondent, Jack Belden, wrote books about the walkout: Walkout with Stilwell in Burma (1971) and Retreat with Stilwell (1943), respectively. The Assam route was also used by other retreating Allied and Chinese forces.|$|E

25|$|The {{expected}} communist assailants not yet having arrived, Team D began a new training cycle. They {{were joined}} by two Central Intelligence Agency paramilitary case officers, William Young and Joe Hudachek. By mid February, five ADC companies were in action, two more were in training, and four more were being formed. Meantime, {{the head of the}} Programs Evaluation Office succeeded in being granted funding for the CIA to import 385 Thai specialists, including more PARU teams. In the short term, three more CIA paramilitaries joined Momentum from <b>Sea</b> <b>Supply.</b> Thomas Fosmire arrived, and he and PARU Team K opened the second Momentum training base at Ban Na. Jack Shirley and Tony Poe were the other two; Poe later opened the third Momentum site at Phou Nong Py, in conjunction with PARU Team M. Taking some recently trained Hmong cadre with them, Lieutenant Santi Intakon and his PARU Team E moved to Phou Vieng, cut out a crude airstrip, and started an ADC training site there.|$|E
500|$|The Southwest Pacific {{was not a}} {{promising}} theater of war for the strategic bomber. The bombers of the day {{did not have the}} range to reach Japan from Australia, and there were no typical strategic targets in the theater other than a few oil refineries. Thus, [...] "The air mission was to interdict Japan's <b>sea</b> <b>supply</b> lanes and enable the ground forces to conduct an island-hopping strategy." [...] This set up a doctrinal clash between Kenney, an attack aviator, and Walker, the bomber advocate. The long-standing Air Corps tactic for attacking shipping called for large formations of high-altitude bombers. With sufficient mass, so the theory went, bombers could bracket any ship with walls of bombs, and do so from above the effective range of the ship's anti-aircraft fire. However the theoretical mass required was two orders of magnitude greater than what was available in the Southwest Pacific. A dozen or so bombers was the most that could be put together, owing to the small number of aircraft in the theater and the difficulties of keeping them serviceable. The results were therefore generally ineffective, and operations incurred heavy casualties.|$|E
500|$|T5 {{was also}} {{returned}} to the KJRM-in-exile in December 1943. T6 was scuttled by the Italians [...] north of Rimini on 11 September as she had insufficient fuel on board to reach an Allied port. Once under German control, T7 was also {{handed over to the}} Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, and served under her Yugoslav designation. Her crew came under the influence of Yugoslav Partisan propaganda, and were preparing to mutiny when the Germans intervened. On 24 June 1944, she and the S-boats S 154 and S 157 of the 7th S-Boat Flotilla were sailing between Šibenik and Rijeka, protecting German <b>sea</b> <b>supply</b> routes along the Adriatic, when they were attacked by the Royal Navy Fairmile D motor torpedo boats MTB 659, MTB 662 and MTB 670 near the island of Kukuljari, south of Murter Island. The MTBs fired two torpedoes at T7, but missed, so they closed and engaged her with their guns, setting her ablaze. She was beached, and 21 crew were rescued by the MTBs. The British crews later examined the wreck, capturing five more crew, then destroyed her with demolition charges. T8 was sunk [...] north-west of Dubrovnik by German aircraft while evacuating Italian troops from Dalmatia on 10 or 11 September 1943.|$|E

50|$|The {{data about}} the drift of the St. Anna on the pack ice of the Kara <b>Sea</b> <b>supplied</b> by Albanov were {{carefully}} studied in 1924 by Soviet oceanographer V. Yu. Vize. He detected an odd deviation of {{the path of the}} ship's drift caused by certain variations of the patterns of sea and ice currents. Professor Vize deemed that the deviation was caused by the presence of an undiscovered island whose coordinates he was able to calculate with precision thanks to Albanov's data. This island was later discovered and named Vize Island.|$|R

500|$|T7 {{was then}} {{operated}} by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two [...] L/40 anti-aircraft guns, but no other significant alterations was made to her. After the Italians capitulated in September 1943, once under German control, T7 was {{handed over to the}} Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, and served under her Yugoslav designation. Her crew came {{under the influence of the}} Yugoslav Partisans, and were preparing to mutiny when the Germans intervened. On 24 June 1944, she and the German [...] S-boats S 154 and S 157 of the 7th S-Boat Flotilla were sailing between Šibenik and Rijeka, protecting German <b>sea</b> <b>supply</b> routes along the Adriatic, when they were attacked by the Royal Navy Fairmile D motor torpedo boats MTB 659, MTB 662 and MTB 670 near the island of Kukuljari, south of Murter Island.

500|$|Zniam was {{stranded}} on 19 December 1943 and was torpedoed by Royal Navy Motor Torpedo Boats (MTBs) two days later. On 24 June 1944, T7 and two German [...] S-boats were sailing between Šibenik and Rijeka, protecting German <b>sea</b> <b>supply</b> routes along the Adriatic, {{when they were}} attacked by three Royal Navy MTBs near the island of Kukuljari, south of Murter Island.

The British crews later examined the wreck, capturing five more crew, then destroyed her with demolition charges. The river monitor Bosna struck a mine in the same month, and Sava was scuttled on 8 September 1944 when her crew deserted to the Partisans. Mosor was {{stranded on}} Ist Island near Zadar on 31 December 1944, and remained there until {{after the end of}} the war. By this stage, the RMNDH consisted of a flotilla of small coastal craft stationed at Rijeka. The entire flotilla tried to desert to the Partisans in December 1944, but all but one craft (carrying the commander of the flotilla) was prevented from doing so by the Germans. The Germans disarmed the remaining vessels and sent the crews to Zagreb where they formed a special unit for service on land.|$|E
2500|$|As Malta was {{situated}} on the increasingly important <b>sea</b> <b>supply</b> route for the North African campaign, the Luftwaffe returned with a vengeance for a second assault on the island {{at the beginning of}} 1942. It wasn't until March, when the onslaught was at its height, that 15 Spitfires flew in off the carrier [...] to join with the Hurricanes already stationed there and bolster the defence, but many of the new aircraft were lost on the ground and it was again the Hurricane that bore the brunt of the early fighting until further reinforcements arrived.|$|E

2500|$|Pure salvage {{claims are}} divided into [...] "{{high-order}}" [...] and [...] "low-order" [...] salvage. In high-order salvage, the salvor exposes himself and his crew {{to the risk of}} injury and loss or damage to his equipment in order to salvage the property that is in peril. Examples of high-order salvage are boarding a sinking ship in heavy weather, boarding a ship which is on fire, raising a ship, plane, or other sunken property, or towing a ship which is in the surf away from the shore. Low-order salvage occurs where the salvor is exposed to little or no personal risk. Examples of low-order salvage include towing another vessel in calm <b>seas,</b> <b>supplying</b> a vessel with fuel, or pulling a vessel off a sand bar.

40|$|The {{effects of}} tidal forcing on the {{biogeochemical}} patterns of surface water masses {{flowing through the}} Strait of Gibraltar are studied by monitoring the Atlantic Inflow (AI) during both spring and neap tides.
