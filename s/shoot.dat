5|$|The {{structure}} of the root system, comprising a vertical tap root and multiple horizontal laterals, develops in the seedling's first year. Thereafter, the sinker and laterals continue to lengthen, and new laterals appear. There are only three to five laterals at first, but this number typically increases to eight to ten within ten years. During the first winter, {{there is a great}} deal of root system development, especially elongation of the sinker root, but almost no <b>shoot</b> growth. By summer, the sinker root has generally almost reached the water table, and <b>shoot</b> growth increases substantially. Around February, the <b>shoot</b> forms a resting bud, and growth then ceases until October. On resumption of <b>shoot</b> growth, the shoots grow rapidly for a short time, while the plant is under little water stress; then, with the onset of water stress, the plants settles into a long period of slower <b>shoot</b> growth. This pattern of summer-only <b>shoot</b> growth is maintained throughout the life of the plant, except that in mature plants, seasonal <b>shoot</b> growth may cease with the formation of a terminal inflorescence rather than a resting bud. Inflorescence development continues after <b>shoot</b> growth ceases, and flowering commences in February or March. March and April are the peak months for flowering, which ends in July or August.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurring}} {{horror story}} on many websites and popular media outlets is that Japanese soldiers during World War II inflicted bamboo torture upon prisoners of war. The victim was supposedly tied securely in place above a young bamboo <b>shoot.</b> Over several days, the sharp, fast growing <b>shoot</b> would first puncture, then completely penetrate the victim's body, eventually emerging {{through the other}} side. Possibility of this method was tested on an episode of MythBusters, and confirmed.|$|E

5|$|An initial photo <b>shoot</b> {{with the}} band's long-time {{photographer}} Anton Corbijn was done near U2's Berlin hotel in late 1990. Most {{of the photos}} were black-and-white, and the group felt they were not indicative {{of the spirit of}} the new album. They re-commissioned Corbijn for an additional two-week photo <b>shoot</b> in Tenerife in February 1991, for which they dressed up and mingled with the crowds of the annual Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, presenting a more playful side of themselves. It was during the group's time in Tenerife and during a four-day <b>shoot</b> in Morocco in July that they were photographed in drag. Additional photos were taken in Dublin in June, including a shot of a naked Clayton. The images were intended to confound expectations of U2, and their full colour contrasted with the monochromatic imagery on past sleeves.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the quick}} {{schedule}} of the <b>shoot,</b> Industrial Light & Magic immediately began visual effects work. While the skeletal {{forms of the}} pirates revealed by moonlight take up relatively little screentime, the crew knew their computer-generated forms had to convince in terms of replicating performances and characteristics of the actors, or else the transition would not work. Each scene featuring them was shot twice: a reference plate with the actors, and then without them to add in the skeletons, an aesthetic complicated by Verbinski's decision to <b>shoot</b> the battles with handheld cameras. The actors also had to perform their scenes again on the motion capture stage. With the <b>shoot</b> only wrapping up four months before release, Verbinski spent 18-hour days on the edit, {{while at the same}} time spending time on 600 effects shots, 250 of which were merely removing modern sailboats from shots.|$|E

5|$|Desert Strike is a <b>shoot</b> 'em up game {{in which}} the player pilots an AH-64 Apache helicopter.

The player views the action from outside the helicopter, rather than from within the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|During the game, Quickdraw must {{locate the}} wanted outlaws one by one. Once an outlaw {{has been found}} and shot (shooting the outlaw does not kill him, but only initiates a duel), the game shifts to the first-person {{targeting}} minigame. This time, the player must <b>shoot</b> the rapidly moving outlaw as quickly as possible. The player can either wait for the outlaw to draw, or take the initiative and <b>shoot</b> first, which will make the bandit draw his weapon as well. If the player successfully shoots an outlaw, a bounty is paid (increasing with every round), and a new outlaw enters the town.|$|E

5|$|<b>Shoot</b> 'em ups are a subgenre of shooter game, in turn a type {{of action}} game. These games are usually viewed from a {{top-down}} or side-view perspective, and players must use ranged weapons to take action at a distance. The player's avatar is typically a vehicle under constant attack. Thus, the player's goal is to <b>shoot</b> {{as quickly as possible}} at anything that moves or threatens him. In some games, the player's character can withstand some damage; in others, a single hit will result in his destruction. The main skills required in <b>shoot</b> 'em ups are fast reactions and memorising enemy attack patterns. Some games feature overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles and the player has to memorise their patterns to survive. These games belong to one of the fastest-paced video game genres.|$|E
