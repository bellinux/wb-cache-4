25|$|One of {{the most}} {{visually}} striking features of a steam locomotive is its wheel arrangement which is largely a function of its intended application and purpose. The fundamental principle of design for 19th century steam locomotives was tractive force which relies on adhesion. A switching locomotive for example, is relatively low-powered but with a high <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> for getting heavy cars rolling quickly. These locomotives are geared to produce high torque but are restricted to low top speeds and have small diameter driving wheels. Switchers are rail analogs to tugboats. For higher speeds, larger boilers were required which in turn {{led to the development}} of lead trucks.|$|E
500|$|Development of the General Electric (GE) {{steam turbine}} {{locomotives}} began in late 1936, when GE and the Union Pacific (UP) began collaborating on an oil-powered steam turbine-electric design that they termed a [...] "steam-electric locomotive". To produce an altogether {{new type of}} locomotive, GE hoped to adopt mature steam turbine technology from maritime and stationary applications for railroad use. Early GE specifications detailed a streamlined shape, 2+C-C+2 wheel arrangement, and production of [...] and [...] of <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> (the force generated by a locomotive's prime mover in order to generate motion through tractive force).|$|E
500|$|The February 1939 {{issue of}} General Electric Review claimed {{that each of}} the steam turbine {{locomotives}} could attain speeds of [...] and that they had two times a conventional steam locomotive's thermal efficiency. The two units built for UP were streamlined and capable of producing , and had been designed to operate together [...] "elephant style", nose to tail. Fully loaded, each of the two locomotives weighed [...] Each could produce [...] of <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort,</b> and between [...] and [...] of continuous tractive effort, depending on the amount of cooling.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is {{only the}} [...] "average" [...] force, as not all effort is {{constant}} during the one revolution of the drivers. At some points of the cycle only one piston is exerting turning moment and at other points both pistons are working. Not all boilers deliver full power at <b>starting,</b> and the <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> also decreases as the rotating speed increases.|$|R
2500|$|H220 never {{operated}} in its intended role as power for The Overland, {{although it did}} make a brief appearance on the Western line in 1949 when it ran a series of trials with the VR dynamometer car on goods trains from Melbourne to Ballarat.

500|$|The {{heavy loads}} of coal on BM drove GE's design choices on the E60C. GE chose a six-axle (C-C) design, with [...] wheels {{instead of the}} {{standard}} [...] wheels.

In the 1970s Amtrak operated both old-style steam-heated cars and new Amfleet cars with head-end power (HEP). GE designed two variants to handle these use cases: the E60CP had steam generators, while the E60CH had HEP generators. Both models had a cab and pantograph at each end. Reflecting the varied electrification schemes on the Northeast Corridor the Amtrak units could operate at three different voltages: 11 kV 25 Hz AC, 12.5 kV 60 Hz AC, and 25 kV 60 Hz.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} locomotives {{in revenue}} service were small four-wheeled ones {{similar to the}} Rocket. However, the inclined cylinders caused the engine to rock, so they first became horizontal and then, in his [...] "Planet" [...] design, were mounted inside the frames. While this improved stability, the [...] "crank axles" [...] were extremely prone to breakage. Greater speed was achieved by larger driving wheels at expense of a tendency for wheel slip when <b>starting.</b> Greater <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> was obtained by smaller wheels coupled together, but speed was limited by {{the fragility of the}} cast iron connecting rods. Hence, from the beginning, there was a distinction between the light fast passenger locomotive and the slower more powerful goods engine. Edward Bury, in particular, refined this design and the so-called [...] "Bury Pattern" [...] was popular for a number of years, particularly on the London and Birmingham.|$|R
50|$|Type 126 was {{the result}} of an order from SNCB to BN in 1964 for 5 {{prototype}} electric locomotives that would be more powerful than all previous types. Additional weight was designed in at the <b>start</b> to increase <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> as with Type 123. Although Type 126 certainly looks Belgian with a strong resemblance to Type 150/Class 15, it is in fact an SNCF Class BB 9400 under the skin. The main internal difference between the two was BB 9400 ran on 1500 volts DC and Type 126 ran on 3000 volts DC. Most electrical components either came directly from France or were license-built in Belgium. These locos also had wheelslip detection. When the production series of locomotives were ordered they incorporated what SNCB had learned from the 5 prototypes. The five prototypes were rebuilt in 1976-1977 to bring them up to standard with the production batch, which had a number of small improvements. Unusually for SNCB, the French heritage of these locomotives got them classified as B-B rather than Bo-Bo, being fitted with license-built Schneider monomotor bogies.|$|R

With a new computer software for the on-board computer and one inverter per axle (or [...] "P6"; EMD named it [...] "Individual Axle Control") - unlike most of previous EMD locomotives that use one inverter per truck, the SD70ACe-T4 is capable of generating 200,000lbf. (889.64kN.) of <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort,</b> and 175,000lbf. (778.75kN.) of continuous tractive effort. Meanwhile, its dynamic braking effort is as much as 105,000lbf. (467.25kN.) The amount of <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is {{equal to that of}} the 6,000hp SD90MAC-H while, on the other hand, its continuous tractive effort is higher than that of the SD90MAC-H (175,000lbf. vs. 165,000lbf.). Due to the [...] "Individual Axle Control", the locomotive will have improved reliability performance and maintenance. The units are also equipped with [...] "radial bogies" [...] which offer increased adhesion and better ride quality.|$|E
2500|$|Both bogies are {{powered by}} two forced-air cooled {{traction}} motors each. Each motor has a continuous power rating of 1,250kW, the UIC power {{rating of the}} vehicle is 4,800kW, and the largest <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> 200kN.

50|$|The {{three main}} {{categories}} of locomotives are often subdivided in their usage in rail transport operations. There are passenger locomotives, freight locomotives and switcher (or shunting) locomotives. These categories determine the locomotive's combination of physical size, <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> and maximum permitted speed. Freight locomotives are normally designed to deliver high starting tractive effort—needed to start trains that may weigh {{as much as}} 15,000 LT—and deliver sustained high power, at the sacrifice of maximum speed. Passenger locomotives develop less <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> but are able to operate at the high speeds demanded by passenger schedules. Mixed traffic locomotives (US English: general purpose or road switcher locomotives) are built to provide elements of both requirements. They do not develop as much <b>starting</b> <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> as a freight unit but are able to haul heavier trains than a passenger engine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tractive</b> <b>effort</b> is {{the figure}} often quoted when {{comparing}} {{the powers of}} steam locomotives, but is misleading because <b>tractive</b> <b>effort</b> shows the ability to start a train, not the ability to haul it.

50|$|Drawbar pull is a {{function}} of velocity, and in general decreases as the speed of the vehicle increases (due both to increasing resistance and decreasing transmission gear ratios).
