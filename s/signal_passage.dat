If I mention my own greater bookishness, by which I mean his less quantitative reading, it is to give myself better occasion to note that he was always reading some vital book. It might be some out-of-the-way book, but it had {{the root of the}} human matter in it: a volume of great trials; one of the supreme autobiographies; a <b>signal</b> <b>passage</b> of history, a narrative of travel, a story of captivity, which gave him life at first-hand. As I remember, he did not care much for fiction, and in that sort he had certain distinct loathings; there were certain authors whose names he seemed not so much to pronounce as to spew out of his mouth. Goldsmith was one of these, but his prime abhorrence was my dear and honored prime favorite, Jane Austen. He once said to me, I suppose after he had been reading some of my unsparing praises of her--I am always praising her, [...] "You seem to think that woman could write," [...] and he forbore withering me with his scorn, apparently because we had been friends so long, and he more pitied than hated me for my bad taste. He seemed not to have any preferences among novelists; or at least I never heard him express any. He used to read the modern novels I praised, in or out of print; but I do not think he much liked reading fiction. As for plays, he detested the theatre, and said he would as lief do a sum as follow a plot on the stage. He could not, or did not, give any reasons for his literary abhorrences, and perhaps he really had none. But he could have said very distinctly, if he had needed, why he liked the books he did. I was away {{at the time of his}} great Browning passion, and I know of it chiefly from hearsay; but at the time Tolstoy was doing what could be done to make me over Clemens wrote, [...] "That man seems to have been to you what Browning was to me." [...] I do not know that he had other favorites among the poets, but he had favorite poems which he liked to read to you, and he read, of course, splendidly. I have forgotten what piece of John Hay's it was that he liked so much, but I remembered how he fiercely revelled in the vengefulness of William Morris's 'Sir Guy of the Dolorous Blast,' and how he especially exalted in the lines which tell of the supposed speaker's joy in slaying the murderer of his brother: ...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to examine the effects of}} different geographical background contexts for information on comprehension, recall, and cognitive load. Two different contexts, American geographical background and Korean geographical background, were employed to frame explanations of global warming phenomena. Students 2 ̆ 7 comprehension was calibrated by two different levels of measurement, which were fact-level learning (shallow understanding) and inference-making (deep understanding). Cognitive load was gauged by self-reported levels of motivation, difficulty, and mental effort. It was hypothesized that an American context would be more familiar and Korean context less familiar for American students. It was also hypothesized that unfamiliar contexts would create disadvantages in comprehension, recall, and cognitive load, but that signaling would improve comprehension and recall and reduce cognitive load, especially in unfamiliar contexts. ^ Students from two educational psychology courses were randomly assigned to one of four groups in which they read one of the four different types of passages online: an American <b>signaled</b> <b>passage,</b> an American nonsignaled <b>passage,</b> a Korean <b>signaled</b> <b>passage,</b> and a Korean nonsignaled passage. Participants took comprehension and recall tests and reported their perceived levels of motivation, difficulty, and mental effort in the same online environment. Results were analyzed by MANCOVA (multivariate analysis of covariance). The analyses revealed that (1) students were significantly more confident in their American geographical prior knowledge, which was interpreted as an indicator that an American context for information was more familiar to them; (2) context familiarity had positive effects on students 2 ̆ 7 levels of inference-making, their self-reported levels of motivation, and perceived levels of difficulty; and (3) signaling had a negative effect on inference-making. An expertise reversal effect was noted for participants 2 ̆ 7 deep understanding. The findings of the current study imply that learning materials that are framed within an unfamiliar context can create disadvantages for students 2 ̆ 7 motivation and deep comprehension.

40|$|In spring 1993, {{microwave}} radiometer-based tropospheric calibration {{was provided}} for the Mars Observer gravitational wave search. The Doppler shifted X-band radio signals propagating between Earth and the Mars Observer satellite were precisely measured to determine path length variations that might <b>signal</b> <b>passage</b> of gravitational waves. Experimental sensitivity was restricted by competing sources of variability in signal transit time. Principally, fluctuations in the solar wind and ionospheric plasma density combined with fluctions in tropospheric refractivity determined the detection limit. Troposphere-induced path delay fluctions are dominated by refractive changes caused by water vapor inhomogeneities blowing through the signal path. Since passive microwave remote sensing techniques are able to determine atmospheric propagation delays, radiometer-based tropospheric calibration was provided at the Deep Space Network Uranus tracking site (DSS- 15). Two microwave water vapor radiometers (WVRs), a microwave temperature profiler (MTP), and a ground based meterological station were deployed to determine line-of-sight vapor content and vertical temperature profile concurrently with Mars Observer tracking measurements. This calibration system provided the capability to correct Mars Observer Doppler data for troposphere-induced path variations. We present preliminary analysis of the Doppler and WVR data sets illustrating the utility of WVRs to calibrate Doppler data. This takes an important step toward realizing the ambitious system required to support future Ka-band Cassini satellite gravity wave tropospheric calibration system...|$|E
40|$|Fragments of deep-ocean tidal records up to 3 days long {{belong to}} the same {{functional}} sub-space, regardless of the record's origin. The tidal sub-space basis can be derived via Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of a tidal record of a single buoy. Decomposition of a tsunami buoy record in a functional space of tidal EOFs presents an efficient tool for a short-term tidal forecast, as well as for an accurate tidal removal (Tolkova, E. 2009. Principal Component Analysis of Tsunami Buoy Record: Tide Prediction and Removal. Dyn. Atmos. Oceans, 46 (1 - 4) : 62 - 82.) EOF analysis of a time series, however, assumes that the time series represents a stationary (in the weak sense) process. In the present work, a modification of one-dimensional EOF formalism not restricted to stationary processes is introduced. With this modification, the EOF-based de-tiding/forecasting technique can be interpreted in terms of a <b>signal</b> <b>passage</b> through a filter bank, which is unique for the sub-space spanned by the EOFs. This interpretation helps to identify a harmonic content of a continuous process whose fragments are decomposed by given EOFs. In particular, seven EOFs and a constant function are proved to decompose 1 -day-long tidal fragments at any location. Filtering by projection into a reduced sub-space of the above EOFs is capable of separating a tsunami wave from a tidal component within a few millimeter accuracy from the first minutes of the tsunami appearance on a tsunami buoy record, and is reliable in the presence of data gaps. EOFs with ~ 3 -day duration (a reciprocal of either tidal band width) allow short-term (24. 75 hour in advance) tidal predictions using the inherent structure of a tidal signal. The predictions do not require any a priori knowledge of tidal processes at a particular location, except for recent 49. 5 hour long recordings at the location. Comment: 26 pages, 17 figure...|$|E
40|$|Speech {{enhancement}} {{by means}} of microphone array signal processing has {{a major role in}} voice communication applications such as audio-conferencing, hands-free telephony, voice recognition and hearing aids. In these communication scenarios, the speaker is positioned at a remote distance from the microphones, which causes problems of environment noise and interfering sound corrupting the received speech. Additionally, reverberations of the voice from walls or ceilings, also impairs the received speech signal. In the case of a duplex communication, the acoustic feedback constitutes another disturbance for the talker who hears his or her voice echoed. Successful speech enhancement solutions should achieve speech dereverberation, efficient noise and interference reduction, and for mobile environments, they should also provide an adaptation capacity to speaker motion. Microphone arrays spatially sample the sound pressure field. When combined with spatio-temporal filtering techniques known as beamforming, they can extract the sound source information from signals, of which only a mixture is observed. This is based on the inherent ability of sensor arrays to exploit the spatial correlation of multiple received signals. A subband beamforming structure can be used in order to improve the performance of the time-domain filters and reduce their computational complexity. Each of the received signals is decomposed into a set of narrow-band signals and the filtering operations of the beamformer are performed for each frequency band separately. The output of the subband beamformers are then used to reconstruct a full-band output signal. In this thesis an adaptive subband RLS beamforming approach is investigated and evaluated in real hands-free acoustical environments. The proposed methodology is defined such to perform background noise and acoustic coupling reduction, while producing an undistorted filtered version of the signal originating from a desired location. The beamformer recursively minimizes a Least Squares error based on the continuously received data. This adaptive structure allows for a tracking of the noise characteristics, such to accomplish its attenuation in an efficient manner. A soft constraint built from calibration data in low noise conditions guarantee the integrity of the desired signal without the need of any speech detection. Additionally, a new spatial filter bank design method for beamforming applications, which includes the constraint of <b>signal</b> <b>passage</b> at one position and closing in other undesired positions, is suggested. Furthermore, to allow for source mobility tracking, a soft constrained beamforming approach with built-in speaker localization, is proposed. The source of interest is modelled as a cluster of point sources and source motion is accommodated by revising the point source cluster. Real speech signals are used in the simulations and results show accurate speaker movement tractability with maintained noise and interference suppression of about 10 - 15 dB, when using a four-microphone array...|$|E

At the low gas pressures, less than 20 mTorr, in the absorption cell the sweep rate through a Doppler-broadened absorption line (ca. 0. 5 ns), is much faster than the collisional relaxation time of the ethylene and this leads to rapid passage effects.
