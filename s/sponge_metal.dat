This study establishes an initial database of sponge elemental content.

The metal content of 16 common sponge species was determined using ICP measurements. A combination of statistical methods was used to determine the correlations between the metals and detect species with significantly high or low concentrations of these metals. Bioaccumulation factors were calculated to compare <b>sponge</b> <b>metal</b> content to local sediment. Theonella swinhoei contained an extremely high concentration of arsenic and barium, much higher (at least 200 times) than all other species and local sediment. Hyrtios erecta had significantly higher concentration of Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ti and V than all other species. This is due to sediment accumulation and inclusion in the skeleton fibers of this sponge species.

Effects that are induced by vacuum instrumentation need to be reduced in order to obtain accurate pressure measurements. This paper presents the current status of the CEBAF DC photogun.

Prior to the introduction of antibiotics, Ag+ was arguably the most important antimicrobial and with the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance, interest in Ag+ and its compounds as alternative antimicrobials have recently been revived. However, resistance to Ag+-based compounds has been emerging, with initial reports of carriage of silver resistance on a Salmonella enetrica serovar Typhimurium multi-resistance plasmid pMG 101 isolated from burns patients in 1975. The proposed model for the mechanism of Ag+ resistance encoded by the sil genes from pMG 101 involves export of Ag+ ions via an ATPase (SilP), an RND family effluxer (SilCFBA) and a periplasmic chaperone of Ag+ (SilE).
