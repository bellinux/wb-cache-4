5|$|Since many {{substrates}} are not stable to <b>sodium</b> <b>hydride,</b> several {{procedures have}} been developed using milder bases. Masamune and Roush have developed mild conditions using lithium chloride and DBU. Rathke extended this to lithium or magnesium halides with triethylamine.

5|$|Though {{metallic}} sodium has some important uses, the major applications for sodium use compounds; millions {{of tons of}} sodium chloride, hydroxide, and carbonate are produced annually. Sodium chloride is extensively used for anti-icing and de-icing and as a preservative; sodium bicarbonate is mainly used for cooking. Along with potassium, many important medicines have sodium added to improve their bioavailability; though potassium is the better ion in most cases, sodium is chosen for its lower price and atomic weight. <b>Sodium</b> <b>hydride</b> is used as a base for various reactions (such as the aldol reaction) in organic chemistry, and as a reducing agent in inorganic chemistry.|$|E

25|$|Alcohols {{behave as}} weak acids, {{undergoing}} deprotonation, but strong bases are required. The deprotonation reaction {{to produce an}} alkoxide salt is performed with a strong base such as <b>sodium</b> <b>hydride</b> or sodium metal.|$|E
25|$|DMSO can {{decompose}} at {{the boiling}} temperature of 189°C at normal pressure, possibly {{leading to an}} explosion.

25|$|Alcohols, like water, {{can show}} either acidic or basic {{properties}} at the -OH group. With a pKa of around 16-19, they are, in general, slightly weaker acids than water, {{but they are}} still able to react with strong bases such as <b>sodium</b> <b>hydride</b> or reactive metals such as sodium.

25|$|Reactions {{including}} the use of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydride</b> in DMF as a solvent are somewhat hazardous; exothermic decompositions have been reported at temperatures as low as 26°C. On a laboratory scale any thermal runaway is (usually) quickly noticed and brought under control with an ice bath and this remains a popular combination of reagents. On a pilot plant scale, on the other hand, several accidents have been reported.|$|E
25|$|The {{synthesis}} {{starts with}} the condensation of 3-acetylacetanilide (1) with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMFDMA) to give the eneamide (2). The anilide nitrogen is then alkylated by means of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydride</b> and ethyl iodide to give 3. The {{first step in the}} condensation with 3-amino-4-cyanopyrazole can be visualized as involving an addition-elimination reaction sequence on the eneamide function to give a transient intermediate such as 5. Cyclization then leads to formation of the fused pyrimidine ring to afford zaleplon (6).|$|E
25|$|The N–H {{center has}} a pKa of 21 in DMSO, so that very strong bases such as <b>sodium</b> <b>hydride</b> or n-butyl lithium and water-free {{conditions}} {{are required for}} complete deprotonation. The resulting organometalic derivatives can react in two ways. The more ionic salts such as the sodium or potassium compounds tend to react with electrophiles at nitrogen-1, whereas the more covalent magnesium compounds (indole Grignard reagents) and (especially) zinc complexes tend to react at carbon 3 (see figure below). In analogous fashion, polar aprotic solvents such as DMF and DMSO tend to favour attack at the nitrogen, whereas nonpolar solvents such as toluene favour C3 attack.|$|E

25|$|Hirama {{synthesized}} compactin {{and used}} one of the intermediates to follow a different path to get to lovastatin. The synthetic sequence {{is shown in the}} schemes below. The γ-lactone was synthesized using Yamada methodology starting with glutamic acid. Lactone opening was done using lithium methoxide in methanol and then silylation to give a separable mixture of the starting lactone and the silyl ether. The silyl ether on hydrogenolysis followed by Collins oxidation gave the aldehyde. Stereoselective preparation of (E,E)-diene was accomplished by addition of trans-crotyl phenyl sulfone anion, followed by quenching with Ac2O and subsequent reductive elimination of sulfone acetate. Condensation of this with lithium anion of dimethyl methylphosphonate gave compound 1. Compound 2 was synthesized as shown in the scheme in the synthetic procedure. Compounds 1 and 2 were then combined together using 1.3 eq <b>sodium</b> <b>hydride</b> in THF followed by reflux in chlorobenzene for 82 hr under nitrogen to get the enone 3.|$|E
