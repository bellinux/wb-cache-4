5|$|Debate {{on church}} {{officers}} began on 19 October. The Assembly {{began with the}} issue of ordination, as many of the divines were concerned about the rise of various sectarian movements and the lack of any mechanism for ordination of ministers of the established church. While some members did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> ordination necessary for preachers (though they should not administer the sacraments without it), a majority of the divines thought any regular preaching without ordination unacceptable and wished to erect a provisional presbytery for purposes of ordination. There was also debate at this early stage over the nature of the visible church. The congregationalists considered a church to be a single local congregation, while the majority considered the national church to be a unity and were alarmed at the prospect of a disintegrated English church. Despite these debates, up until the end of 1643 there was hope that a common church government could be framed that would be satisfactory to all parties involved.|$|E

500|$|The {{photos on}} the album were taken by Michael Maggid, a friend of Morrison's then wife Janet Planet, {{in the town of}} Fairfax. The {{original}} LP was released in a gatefold sleeve. The cover photograph showed Planet, riding bareback on a horse, with Morrison walking alongside. The gatefold and back cover photographs showed Morrison perched upon the fence of the horse's paddock, with his wife standing to his right and a black-and-white kitten on the fence to his left. [...] This rural setting depicting a bygone era was in vogue on album covers at the time as rock artists moved from cities to rural communities. [...] The Band, CSNY and Grateful Dead had similar themes on album covers in 1969 and 1970. [...] Morrison later complained of the cover, explaining that, [...] "The picture was taken at a stable and I didn't live there. We just went there and took the picture and split. A lot of people <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that album covers are your life or something." ...|$|E

500|$|The indulgence {{controversy}} {{set off by}} the Theses was {{the beginning}} of the Reformation, a schism in the Roman Catholic Church which initiated profound and lasting social and political change in Europe. Luther later stated that the issue of indulgences was insignificant relative to controversies which he would enter into later, such as his debate with Erasmus over the bondage of the will, nor did he see the controversy as important to his intellectual breakthrough regarding the gospel. Luther later wrote that at the time he wrote the Theses he remained a [...] "papist", and he did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> the Theses represented a break with established Catholic doctrine. But it was out of the indulgences controversy that the movement which would be called the Reformation began, and the controversy propelled Luther to the leadership position he would hold in that movement. The Theses also made evident that Luther believed the church was not preaching properly and that this put the laity in serious danger. Further, the Theses contradicted the decree of Pope Clement VI, that indulgences are the treasury of the church. This disregard for papal authority presaged later conflicts.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately" [...] is {{described}} as an uptempo dance song. It begins with a conversation {{with one of her}} friends, who asks Jackson the title question. Lyrically, it involves the singer asking why her lover was not as attentive as he once was. He was not treating her as well as he used to, and she calls him a [...] "loser" [...] in response. [...] "I never ask for more than I deserve, you know it's the truth. You <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> you're God's gift to this earth. I'm telling you no way", Jackson sings. Veda A. McCoy in the book Lifepower: Six Winning Strategies to a Life of Purpose, Passion & Power expressed that the song reminded that [...] "life is about more than just what you say. Life is also about what you do". Vibe noted that with [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", Jackson stands up for men. New York magazine's Chris Smith called the song's chorus [...] "fully belligerent". In a Billboard publication, Nelson George noted its [...] "tauting, tigerish" [...] beat. Ed Gonzalez from Slant Magazine commented, [...] "Nothing sends me into a trembling, corner-cowering stupor than a giggly, under-enunciated Janet Jackson jam." ...|$|E
500|$|Eccleston {{stated in}} April 2004 {{that he did}} not believe his Doctor would be [...] "as {{eccentric}} and as foppish as he was in some of his incarnations". Russell T Davies characterised the character as a [...] "stripped down" [...] version of previous Doctors. Regarding the Ninth Doctor's less eccentric character, Davies stated: [...] "He travels in time and space, he's got two hearts, he's a Time Lord— that's eccentric enough to be getting on with". In contrast with previous Doctors, the Ninth Doctor speaks with a distinct Northern accent. Remarking on this aspect of his characterisation Eccleston states that the character [...] "is a scientist and an intellectual, {{and a lot of people}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> you can only be those things if you speak with received pronunciation which, of course, is rubbish." [...] In regards to the Doctor's costume, consisting of simply a black leather coat and dark trousers, Eccleston stated, [...] "I didn't want the costume to be my performance" [...] and that [...] "I wanted any flamboyance and colour to come out of my acting." [...] Eccleston thought that as the Doctor he should show a [...] "slight dark side" [...] but also bring out a lighter side. Executive producer Julie Gardner observed that the Ninth Doctor gave Eccleston the chance to be [...] "very intense but also frivolous as well." ...|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{retired in}} 2006. He spent nearly 45years in the Army but called it [...] "a regret" [...] {{that he never}} fought in a {{conventional}} battle—having been in a staff position in 1982 during the Falklands War and serving as a brigade commander in Northern Ireland during the Gulf War. He said that [...] "Fighting is what {{a young man with}} good red blood in his veins joins for. It is the ultimate test for the professional soldier". He has continued to voice opinions on military matters in his retirement. He delivered the annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture four months after leaving the Army. In the lecture, titled The Defence of The Realm in the 21st Century, he criticised the Ministry of Defence and questioned the MoD's understanding of the fundamental ethos of the armed forces. He was critical of the treatment of soldiers, calling some soldiers' accommodation [...] "frankly shaming" [...] and saying that the [...] "Armed Forces' contract with the nation... must be a two-way one", going on to say that [...] "military operations cost in blood and treasure, because risk-free soldiering, which some <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> is possible, is simply a contradiction in terms". The MoD responded by saying that [...] "while we do not agree with everything Sir Mike has said, we are always the first to recognise—for example in relation to medical services and accommodation—that although we have delivered real improvements, there is more we can do".|$|E
500|$|In 1772, Thomas Pennant made {{a tour of}} the Hebrides {{and later}} {{published}} an account of his travels. One of the things Pennant noted while visiting the Isle of Skye, was the Fairy Flag. According to Pennant, the flag was named [...] "Braolauch shi", and was given to the MacLeods by Titania the [...] "Ben-shi", wife of Oberon, king of the fairies. Titania blessed the flag with powers which would manifest when the flag was unfurled three times. On the third time, the flag and flag-bearer would be carried off by an invisible being, never to be seen again. The family of [...] "Clan y Faitter" [...] had the task of bearing the flag, and in return for their services, they possessed free lands in Bracadale. Pennant related how the flag had already been produced three times. The first occasion was in an unequal battle between the MacLeods and the Macdonalds of Clanranald. On the unfurling of the flag, the MacLeod forces were multiplied by ten. The second time the flag was unfurled to preserve the life of the lady of the clan, and thus saved the clan's heir. Pennant then declared that the flag was unfurled a third time to save his own life. He stated that the flag was by then so tattered that Titania did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it worth taking back. Pennant also noted the belief of the MacLeod's Norse ancestry and the magical raven banners said to have been used by the Vikings in the British Isles.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the largely}} {{positive}} view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 {{that he had}} at some point announced, [...] "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." [...] A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of Jailhouse Rock, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though {{he was no longer}} dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement or holding in any way to its racist view: [...] "I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it ... A lot of people <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that." [...] Also, Red Robinson stated, [...] "Take a look at the things that are only publicized now, of how he'd be driving down the street and see a destitute black woman with a little child. He went and bought her a Cadillac. Now if this guy hated blacks, he wouldn't even have gone near them". Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist. Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening, reported of Presley, [...] "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest." [...] Dudley Brooks, an African-American composer and studio musician who worked with Presley during the 1950s and 1960s, also disputed allegations that Presley was a racist. Though the rumored remark was wholly discredited at the time, it was still being used against Presley decades later. The identification of Presley with racism—either personally or symbolically—was expressed most famously in the lyrics of the 1989 rap hit [...] "Fight the Power", by Public Enemy: [...] "Elvis was a hero to most / But he never meant shit to me / Straight-up racist that sucker was / Simple and plain".|$|E
