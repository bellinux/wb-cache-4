40|$|Statement of the Problem: Monomer {{viscosity}} and {{solvent evaporation}} can be af-fected by the adhesive system temperature. Higher temperature can elevate the vapor pressure in solution and penetration of adhesive in <b>smear</b> layer. <b>Bonding</b> mechanism {{may be influenced}} by the adhesive temperature. Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of pre-heating on shear bond strength of etch-and-rinse and self-etching adhesives to ground bovine dentin surfac-es, at temperatures of 4 ˚C, 25 ˚C and 40 ˚C. Materials and Method: In this experimental study, 60 maxillary bovine incisors were randomly divided into 6 groups (n= 10). The central part of labial dentin surfaces was exposed with a diamond bur and standardized smear layer was created by using silicon carbide paper (600 grit) under water-coolant while the specimens were mount-ed in acrylic resin. Two adhesive systems, an etch-and-rinse (Adper single bond) and a self-etch (Clearfil SE Bond) were stored at temperatures of 4 ˚C, 25 ˚C and 40 ˚C for 30 minutes and were then applied on the prepared labial surface according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The composite resin (Z 350) was packed in Teflon mold (5 mm in diameter) on this surface and was cured. The shear bond strength (MPa) was evaluated by universal testing machine (Zwick/Roell Z 020, Germany) at cross head speed of 1 mm/min. The results were statistically analyzed by using ANOVA an...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In this research, MATD and {{two types}} of phosphoric acids' effect on bond {{strength}} of the composite to dentin was evaluated. Methods and materials: 45 premolar healthy teeth mounted in cold acryl were provided. The teeth were sectioned vertically below the enamel and were divided into 3 groups of 15 teeth. Group 1 were etched by Ultradent phosphoric acid for 15 seconds and then washed with pure water and air for 10 seconds. Group 2 were etched by Kimia phosphoric acid for 20 seconds and then washed with pure water and air for 15 seconds. Group 3 were etched by MTAD for 3 minutes and then washed with water for 30 seconds. All of the samples were bonded using single bond (3 M-USA); and Z 100 composite (3 M-USA) were cured on the dentin. All samples were placed in thermo cycle, under 500 cycle period in temperature of 5 - 55 ˚Cand then placed in incubator apparatus for 24 hours, to reach mouth environment. The samples were examined by tensile bond strength test with Instrone apparatus and the data were analyzed by one way ANOVA and Duncan statistical test. Results: The difference between group 2 and groups 1 and 3 was meaningful but the difference between groups 1 and 3 was not. Discussion: The bond strength made by Kimia phosphoric acid {{is less than the}} one which was made by Ultradent phosphoric acid and MTAD. It seems that because of exciting citric acid which can remove the smear layer and external layer of calcium in dentin, MTAD can make higher bond strength in the same range as Ultradent phosphoric acid, as it can be deeply infiltrated in dentin and can wash easily after use.

40|$|The bond {{strength}} between glass ionomer and tooth structure {{can be improved}} with application of conditioner on enamel or dentin surface to remove the <b>smear</b> layer. The <b>bond</b> strength can be measured with shear {{bond strength}} testing. This study aimed to determine the difference of shear bond strength of glass ionomer cement to primary teeth dentine after conditioner application for 10 ", 20 " and 30 ". Twenty seven primary mandibular incisors were randomly divided into 3 groups that were subjected to application of 10 % polyacrylic acid conditioner (Dentin conditioner, GC) for 10 ", 20 " and 30 ", and restoration with glass ionomer cement (Fuji IX, GP, GC). The specimens were kept in an incubator at 37 ºC for 24 hours. Shear bond strength test was done by using Universal Testing Machine Shimazu AG- 5000 with 50 kgf load and crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Anova was used statistical evaluation. Although the results showed {{no statistically significant differences}} in the shear bond strength of the glass ionomer cement between the test groups (p> 0. 05), the mean bond strength decreased with increasing duration of conditioner application, so that highest mean bond strength was obtained at 10 " application. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Erbium, chromium: Yttrium, scandium, gallium, garnet (Er, Cr: YSGG) laser {{has been}} {{successfully}} used in the ablation of dental hard and soft tissues. It {{has been reported that}} this system is also useful for preparing tooth surfaces and etching, but no consensus exist in the literature regarding the advantage of lasers over conventional tooth preparation technique. Materials and Methods: Labial surfaces of 25 extracted human maxillary central incisors were divided into two halves. Right half was prepared with diamond bur and left half with Er, Cr; YSGG laser and a reduction of 0. 3 - 0. 5 mm was carried out. Topography of prepared surfaces of five teeth were examined under scanning electron microscope (SEM). The remaining samples were divided into 4 groups of 10 specimens each based on the surface treatment received: One group was acid etched and other was nonetched. Composite resin cylinders were bonded on prepared surfaces and shear bond strength was assessed using a universal testing machine. Results: The SEM observation revealed that the laser prepared surfaces were clean, highly irregular and devoid of a smear layer. Bur prepared surfaces were relatively smooth but covered with <b>smear</b> layer. Highest <b>bond</b> strength was shown by laser prepared acid etched group, followed by bur prepared the acid etched group. The bur prepared nonacid etched group showed least bond strength. Conclusions: Er, Cr: YSGG laser can be used for preparing tooth and bond strength value achieved by laser preparation alone without surface treatment procedure lies in the range of clinical acceptability...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that formation of inhibition zones by bonded restorations in artificially-induced carious dentin lesions {{is related to the}} permeability of the self-etch adhesives. METHODS: Fluid conductance of four single-step self-etch adhesives (Prompt L-Pop, Etch&Prime 3. 0, One-Up Bond F and Reactmer Bond), and a control two-step self-etch adhesive (UniFil Bond) were measured after sound dentin surfaces were:(1) acid-etched; (2) polished to produce <b>smear</b> layers; (3) <b>bonded</b> with the adhesive; each at 20 cm hydrostatic pressure (hp). Osmotic fluid conductance was also determined for the bonded dentin after immersion in 4. 8 M CaCl 2 at 0 cm hp. For artificial caries inhibition, a non-fluoride releasing (NFR) two-step self-etch adhesive (UniFil Bond) and a fluoride-releasing (FR) single-step adhesive (Reactmer Bond) were used in combination with a NFR composite (Metafil CX) or a FR restorative material (Reactmer Paste). Artificial caries were induced in these restorations, from which 120 +/- 10 microm thick sections and the effect of caries inhibition were quantitatively assessed with polarizing light microscopy and image analysis. RESULTS: Fluid conductance after bonding with the single-step adhesives Prompt L-Pop and Etch&Prime 3. 0 were not significantly different from those recorded from smear layer-covered dentin. Although better seals were achieved with One-Up Bond F and Reactmer Bond, fluid conductance at 20 cm hp was significantly higher than the two-step self-etch adhesive UniFil Bond. Osmotic conductance at 0 cm hp were not significantly different from normal fluid conductance at 20 cm hp. The sizes of artificial carious lesions in UniFil Bond were significantly higher irrespective of whether a FR or NFR composite was used. Significant reduction in lesion size occurred in Reactmer Bond {{with the use of a}} NFR composite, and even more so with the use of a FR composite. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|In this article, the {{formulation}} and verification of a nonlinear quadrilateral layered membrane element with drilling {{degrees of freedom}} for the nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) walls under static and cycling loads are presented. The formulation {{is based on a}} quadrilateral element with twelve degrees of freedom (DOF), two displacements and one drilling DOF per node, which is defined by a blended field interpolation for the displacements over the element, and a layered system for the element section consisting of fully <b>bonded,</b> <b>smeared</b> steel reinforcement and smeared orthotropic concrete material with a rotating angle formulation, and a stiffness tangent approach. The drilling DOF refers to the incorporation of the in-plane rotation as a DOF at each element node. The blended field interpolation has the advantage of producing a smoother strain distribution inside each element, which facilitates element convergence, and the layered section formulation allows for the properties of the concrete and steel over the thickness of the wall to be modified to properly represent the different wall components, such as the concrete cover, steel rebar and confined concrete. Additionally, {{the formulation}} introduces a rotational DOF at each node, which allows the membranes to connect directly to beam and column elements. Moreover, this formulation incorporates the coupling of axial, flexural and shear behavior observed on the different configurations of RC wall structures. To verify this formulation, the results of a set of available experimental data reported in the literature for RC wall elements, with different configurations (slender walls, squat walls, wall with irregular disposition of openings) and levels of confinement, under monotonic and reversed loads are compared with the results obtained from the corresponding analytical model. The formulation is notably consistent with the experimental data and can predict the maximum capacity, the global (force vs deformation) and local responses (strain along the wall) and incorporate the coupling of axial, flexural and shear behavior observed in the different configurations of RC wall structures.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) MICROTENSILE BOND STRENGTH OF NEW PASTE/PASTE RESIN-MODIFIED GLASS IONOMER CEMENT SYSTEMS: THE EFFECT OF DENTIN PRETREATMENT by Yasser Fawaz Al-fawaz Indiana University School of Dentistry Indianapolis, Indiana Background: In {{order to}} improve the {{clinical}} performance of RMGIC 3 M ESPE and GC America introduced paste/paste resin-modified glass ionomer cements, Ketac™ Nano and Fuji Filling™ LC, respectively. Both companies developed non-rinse substrate conditioners (i. e., Ketac Nano Primer- 3 M ESPE and GC Self-Conditioner-GC America) that should be used with these new materials instead of the conventional polyacrylic acid. It has been also advised by both manufacturer’s to use this novel substrate conditioner with the previously marketed RMGICs. Objective: to investigate whether the use of novel non-rinse conditioners (i. e., Ketac Nano Primer 3 M ESPE and GC Self Conditioner GC America) as substrate pre-treatment and the new paste/paste resin-modified glass-ionomer cement, RMGIC (Ketac™ Nano 3 M ESPE and Fuji Filling™ LC GC America) would affect the microtensile dentin bond strength (µTBS) of the material {{when compared to the}} traditional RMGIC with polyacrylic acid as a surface substrate pre-treatment. Materials and Methods: 96 extracted non-restored human molar were sectioned to expose occlusal dentin. Dentin surface was finished with SiC paper to standardize the <b>smear</b> layer. <b>Bonding</b> protocols of the different materials to dentin were performed following the use of two dentin conditioners. Eight groups (n= 12) were tested: G 1 : Ketac Nano Primer + Ketac Nano, G 2 : Ketac Conditioner + Ketac Nano, G 3 : Ketac Nano Primer + Photac Fil, G 4 : Ketac Conditioner + Photac Fil, G 5 : GC Self Conditioner + Fuji Filling LC, G 6 : GC Cavity Conditioner + Fuji Filling LC, G 7 : GC Self Conditioner + Fuji II LC and G 8 : GC Cavity Conditioner + Fuji II LC. The specimens were stored in 37 °C for 24 h in 100 % humidity before cutting non-trimmed beams for the µTBS with cross-sectional areas of approximately 0. 8 × 0. 8 mm 2. Nine beams were used from each specimen. Test was done using universal testing machine at a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min. Debonded specimens were examined under a stereomicroscope at 45 × magnification to evaluate the failure mode. Eight randomly chosen representative debonded beams were imaged under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results: µTBS in MPa (mean ± SE) were: G 1 : 9. 5 ± 1. 0, G 2 : 11. 0 ± 1. 0, G 3 : 20. 0 ± 1. 0, G 4 : 16. 8 ± 0. 9, G 5 : 15. 1 ± 1. 0, G 6 : pre-test failure, G 7 : 20. 0 ± 1. 0, G 8 : 14. 1 ± 0. 9. Weibull-distribution survival analysis was used to compare the differences in microtensile peak stress among the groups. Group 5 has cohesive predominant faultier mod while the other groups have adhesive predominant failure. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, the use of the novel non-rinse conditioners did not improve the microtensile bond strength of new paste/paste RMGIC to dentin. In fact, the use of the novel non-rinse conditioners enhanced the bond strength of the traditional RMGIC to dentin...|$|R
