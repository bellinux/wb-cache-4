5|$|According to {{the later}} Chronicle of Polish Dukes by Gallus, the battle {{occurred}} by accident: When Bolesław decided {{to throw a}} feast to boost his army's morale, Yaroslav's archers and scouts decided to create trouble for the Polish servants who were gutting the animals and preparing them near the river. However, they only annoyed them enough that the servants themselves crossed the relatively shallow river and chased away Yaroslav's surprised troops, who had been guarding the river. Bolesław learned of the skirmish <b>sooner</b> <b>than</b> Yaroslav, and managed to move most of his army across the river, defeating the surprised Yaroslav.|$|E
5|$|Discectomy (the partial {{removal of}} a disc that is causing leg pain) can provide pain relief <b>sooner</b> <b>than</b> nonsurgical treatments. Discectomy has better {{outcomes}} at one year but not at four to ten years. The less invasive microdiscectomy has not been shown {{to result in a}} different outcome than regular discectomy. For most other conditions, there is not enough evidence to provide recommendations for surgical options. The long-term effect surgery has on degenerative disc disease is not clear. Less invasive surgical options have improved recovery times, but evidence regarding effectiveness is insufficient.|$|E
5|$|During Part II of {{the series}} the concept of , {{altering}} the quality of chakra, is introduced. Nature manipulation allows ninja, following certain training, to convert their chakra into one of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind, and lightning. Each element is predominant and subordinate to different elements; for example, fire is weak against water, but can easily counter and even gain strength when used against a wind-based jutsu and earth is weak against lightning based jutsu. Most ninja have a natural affinity {{for one of the}} five elements, allowing them to use jutsu of that type with greater ease. Ninja with an affinity for fire, for instance, will be able to breathe fire much <b>sooner</b> <b>than</b> {{they will be able to}} manipulate water.|$|E

5|$|Early {{forecasts}} remarked {{the potential}} {{to be more of a}} threat to Hawaii than Pauline because Rick was further south than Pauline and thus less likely to weaken since Rick was over of warmer sea surface temperatures than Pauline. It did indeed approached the islands, coming close enough to require a high surf advisory. Even though Rick's intensity was much greater than Pauline's, Hurricane Pauline re-curved <b>sooner</b> <b>than</b> Rick. While the surf did rise somewhat, the waves were significantly lower than the heights experienced during Pauline. The U.S. Coast Guard received a report of an overdue sailing vessel en route to the Hawaiian Island group. However, it is unknown if Pauline or Rick affected the boat's course.|$|E

Rachel's two fathers Hiram and LeRoy Berry (Jeff Goldblum and Brian Stokes Mitchell), along with Finn's mother Carole (Romy Rosemont) and his step-father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), act very supportive and arrange for the couple to spend the night together in Rachel's room, expecting that the reality of having to live together will encourage the teens to postpone their wedding. The ruse backfires, and the engaged pair announce that they will be getting married even <b>sooner</b> <b>than</b> planned.|$|E
5|$|In November 1962, Rolls-Royce {{offered a}} PCB-equipped {{vectored}} thrust twin-Spey design {{as an alternative}} to the BS100. This alternative engine arrangement was widely seen as inferior, particularly due to the danger posed by asymmetric thrust output if a single engine failure occurred; however, Rolls-Royce claimed that their solution could be available <b>sooner</b> <b>than</b> the BS100 would be. In December 1962, Bristol performed the first successful run of a PCB-equipped Pegasus 2 engine. In order to perform a vertical takeoff, the use of PCB was necessitated; however, this feature would have come at the cost of significant ground erosion during operations.|$|E

Maxwell accepted the professorship at Aberdeen, leaving Cambridge in November 1856.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{performance}} of an SSD {{is dependent upon}} a number of factors, including write amplification. Writing to a flash memory device takes longer than reading from it. An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components connected in parallel to increase performance. If the SSD has a high write amplification, the controller {{will be required to}} write that many more times to the flash memory. This requires even more time to write the data from the host. An SSD with a low write amplification will not need to write as much data and can therefore be finished writing <b>sooner</b> <b>than</b> a drive with a high write amplification.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} faint {{luminosity}} of this galaxy, its exact distance was not measured for several years. Well before then, another major breakthrough occurred with the next event registered by BeppoSAX, GRB 970508. This event was localized within four hours of its discovery, allowing research teams to begin making observations much <b>sooner</b> <b>than</b> any previous burst. The spectrum of the object revealed a redshift of z=0.835, placing the burst {{at a distance of}} roughly 6 billionlight years from Earth. This was the first accurate determination of the distance to a GRB, and together with the discovery of the host galaxy of 970228 proved that GRBs occur in extremely distant galaxies. Within a few months, the controversy about the distance scale ended: GRBs were extragalactic events originating within faint galaxies at enormous distances. The following year, GRB 980425 was followed within a day by a bright supernova (SN 1998bw), coincident in location, indicating a clear connection between GRBs and the deaths of very massive stars. This burst provided the first strong clue {{about the nature of the}} systems that produce GRBs.|$|E

5|$|Fast {{was drafted}} by the New York Rangers in the sixth round (157th overall) of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft, having {{obtained}} the sixth round pick from the Carolina Hurricanes {{earlier in the day}} in exchange for defenseman Bobby Sanguinetti. Fast was the fifth of six players the Rangers drafted in 2010, along with Dylan McIlrath, Christian Thomas, Andrew Yogan, Jason Wilson and Randy McNaught. On May 29, 2012, the Rangers announced Fast had been signed to a two-way, three-year entry level contract, valued at $2.145 million, with a $900,000 annual cap hit. Since HV71 was eliminated from the 2012–13 playoffs earlier than expected, Fast had the opportunity to go to the New York Rangers organization <b>sooner</b> <b>than</b> originally planned. The Swedish Hockey League initially voiced objections, but eventually agreed to loan him to the Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Rick {{was a very}} {{powerful}} hurricane that threatened Hawaii during September 1985. Rick originated from a tropical wave moved slowly westward over the warm waters south of Salina Cruz. Moving westward, the EPHC upgraded the low into a tropical depression on 0000UTC September1. The depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Rick midday on September2. Initially, further intensification was slow to occur; the storm did not attain hurricane status until September7, nearly a week after it first formed. After becoming a hurricane, Rick began to intensify more rapidly. Early the next day, the EPHC re-assessed the intensity of Rick to Category4 status. Shortly thereafter, Rick reached its peak intensity of 145mph (230km/h). A weakening trend commenced on September10; Hurricane Rick began to rapidly deteriorate while turning northwest. Within a few hours, the storm had weakened considerably. By September11, Tropical Storm Rick merged with a trough. Early forecasts noted uncertainty in the storm's path; the hurricane approached the Hawaiian island group, coming close enough to require a high surf advisory. Even though Hurricane Rick turned north <b>sooner</b> <b>than</b> Pauline, the surf did rise slightly.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA and STScI convened four panels to discuss key {{projects}}. These were projects that were both scientifically important and would require significant telescope time, {{which would be}} explicitly dedicated to each project. This guaranteed that these particular projects would be completed early, in case the telescope failed <b>sooner</b> <b>than</b> expected. The panels identified three such projects: 1) {{a study of the}} nearby intergalactic medium using quasar absorption lines to determine the properties of the intergalactic medium and the gaseous content of galaxies and groups of galaxies; 2) a medium deep survey using the Wide Field Camera to take data whenever one of the other instruments was being used and 3) a project to determine the Hubble constant within ten percent by reducing the errors, both external and internal, in the calibration of the distance scale.|$|E
