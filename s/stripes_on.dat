5|$|The College colours are {{two white}} <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> navy, {{used on the}} college scarf, sports clothing, oar blades etc.|$|E
5|$|All matches of the Campeonato Brasileiro 2007 {{started with}} a minute of silence, while all players wore black armbands. Brazilian Formula One driver Felipe Massa had a black stripe {{on top of his}} helmet during the 2007 European Grand Prix, to commemorate the victims. Rubens Barrichello also had <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> his helmet, and the two Red Bull Racing drivers David Coulthard and Mark Webber had small Brazilian flags on their helmets {{referring}} to the accident.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine-derived melanin {{probably}} {{appears in}} at least some other biological systems as well. Some of the dopamine in plants is likely {{to be used as a}} precursor for dopamine-melanin. The complex patterns that appear on butterfly wings, as well as black-and-white <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> the bodies of insect larvae, are also thought to be caused by spatially structured accumulations of dopamine-melanin.|$|E
30|$|The {{gray scale}} {{distribution}} of the light <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> {{the surface of the}} cylinder is different from the gray scale {{distribution of the}} light <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> the plane, so the section proposed an image enhancement algorithm for the arc light stripe.|$|R
5000|$|... 1997-2006: For home games, {{gold with}} large purple <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> the side, {{with the name}} [...] "Sparks" [...] written across in purple. For away games, purple with large gold <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> the side, with the name [...] "Los Angeles" [...] in yellow.|$|R
50|$|Common {{variations}} include {{moving the}} purple stripe down below the azure one, and adding a white <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> top (the original flag from the 60s {{had a white}} <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> top). This flag has been adopted internationally {{as a symbol of}} the peace movement.|$|R
5|$|Of {{the commercially}} {{available}} Hippeastrum species, sometimes sold as 'exotic' amaryllis, Hippeastrum cybister has extremely thin petals {{often described as}} spider-like. The miniature evergreen Hippeastrum papilio or 'Butterfly Amaryllis' whose petals resemble a butterfly (papilio) has a unique color and pattern with broad rose-burgundy center stripes and striations of pale green on the upper petals and narrow <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> the bottom three. It has been crossed with both cybister and single flower cultivars to produce hybrids with unusual striping.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, 2017, the Devils {{revealed}} {{their new}} uniforms for the 2017–18 season. Made by Adidas, the new sweaters {{are the first}} major change to the team's look since they replaced green with black. They feature {{the removal of the}} <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> the bottom of the sweater, and also thicker sleeve stripes with equal width bands of white and black.|$|E
5|$|The {{authority}} to wear gold rating badges and service <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> the dress blue and working coverall uniform is granted when a sailor completes and maintains twelve consecutive years of honorable service without any {{official record of}} bad conduct due to punitive action via non-judicial punishment or courts martial. The gold rating badges and service stripes are distinct from the Good Conduct Medal, which is awarded for three years of honorable service.|$|E
50|$|Adults have {{streaked}} brown upperparts with a {{light brown}} breast with streaks, a white belly and a white throat. They have a pale <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> the crown with a dark <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> each side, an olive face and neck, rust-coloured wings and a short dark forked tail.|$|R
50|$|Greyish {{above and}} lighter below {{with a broad}} black <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> {{the side of the}} head, {{extending}} and gradually fading, on the fore part of the body; a grey <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> the outer margins of the ventrals and a less distinct and thinner median one present or absent.|$|R
25|$|Regional {{staff have}} a blue <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> their helmet.|$|R
5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and mixes with the white of the face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} aberrations. The 1992 kit, {{sponsored}} by Triton Showers, {{was made of}} a blue material covered with multicoloured splashes which resembled a shower curtain. Birmingham have only worn <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> their home shirt once; in 1999 they wore a blue shirt with a front central panel in narrow blue and white stripes, a design similar to the Tesco supermarket carrier bag of the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Senators {{unveiled}} a new logo, taking the head, {{which had been}} in profile, and rotating {{it so that it}} was face-first. The new logo was unveiled with a new red 'third' jersey, prominently using 'curved' or 'swoosh' <b>stripes.</b> <b>On</b> the shoulder, the original logo was used as a shoulder patch. The original dark jersey, (then the 'away' jersey) which was mostly black, was retired after the season. The red jersey became the home jersey and it remained in use {{until the end of the}} 2007 Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
40|$|Inheritance {{study of}} {{groundnut}} {{indicated that a}} single dominant gene governed the flower with red <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> standard. All F 1 plants had red <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> standard. The segregation of F 3 : 2 families (derived from individual F 2 plants) showed 1 : 2 : 1 expected ratio (χ 2 = 0. 659) of 1 non-segregating (plants with red <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> standard) to 2 segregating (plants with red <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> standard and plants with no red <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> standard) to 1 non-segregating (plant with no red <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> standard). When the F 3 groundnut families which had plants with red <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> standard were combined, the segregation ratio was not different from the 3 : 1 Mendelian ratio (χ 2 = 0. 073). The symbols for standard flower trait were designated St for dominant trait and st for recessive trait. For peg's color characteristic, the plants with red <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> standard flower had purple peg. It {{is possible that the}} red <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> standard flower gene had a pleiotropic effect on peg color or this may indicate linked genes. For characters of pod, the F 1 showed moderately reticulate pods. The segregation of F 3 : 2 families showed also a 1 : 2 : 1 expected ratio (χ 2 = 0. 067) giving 1 non-segregating (plants with reticulate pod) to 2 segregating (plants with reticulate pod and plants with smooth pod) to 1 non-segregating (plants with smooth pod). When the F 3 groundnut families which had plants with reticulate pod were combined, the segregation ratio was not different from the 3 : 1 Mendelian ratio (χ 2 = 0. 065). The results indicated that pod characters were governed by a single gene. The symbols of pod character were designated Re for dominant gene and re for recessive gene. For yield components study, the F 3 generation had lower yield than their parents did but some of them had similar yield with their parents. Yield components were highly correlated with each other. In addition, yield components of F 3 families were also correlated with their leaf characters. The plants with larger leaf had bigger pods, more prolific pods, and heavier seeds...|$|R
50|$|In 1991 the Gotland Regiment Honorary Medal (Gotlands regementes hedersmedalj) in {{gold and}} silver was instituted. The medal is of the 8th size, and has a ribbon in blue with a narrow white <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> each side and a narrow red stripe in the middle. In {{connection}} with decommissioning of the regiment in 2005, the Gotland Regiment Memorial Medal (Gotlands regementes minnesmedalj) in silver was instituted. The medal is of the 8th size, and has a blue ribbon with a red <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> the inside followed by a white <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> each side. The ribbon is coated with a ram in silver.|$|R

5|$|Individual quaggas {{were also}} {{captured}} {{and shipped to}} Europe, where they were displayed in zoos. Lord Morton tried to save the animal from extinction by starting a captive breeding program. He was only able to obtain a single male which, in desperation, he bred with a female horse. This produced a female hybrid with zebra <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> its back and legs. Lord Morton's mare was sold and was subsequently bred with a black stallion, resulting in offspring that again had zebra stripes. An account of this was published in 1820 by the Royal Society. This led to new ideas on telegony, referred to as pan-genesis by Charles Darwin.|$|E
5|$|The cheetah {{is often}} {{confused}} with the leopard and the cougar and can be distinguished by its small round spots {{in contrast to the}} leopard's rosettes and the cougar's plain coat; in addition, the leopard lacks the tear streaks of the cheetah. The cougar possesses neither the tear streaks nor the spotted coat pattern of the cheetah. The serval has a form very {{similar to that of the}} cheetah but is significantly smaller. Moreover, it has a shorter tail and spots that fuse to form <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> the back.|$|E
5|$|The liger is a {{cross between}} a male lion and a tigress. Because the lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the {{corresponding}} growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, ligers grow far larger than either parent species. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species (spots and <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> a sandy background). Male ligers are sterile, but female ligers are often fertile. Males have about a 50% chance of having a mane, but, even if they do, their manes will be only around half the size of that of a pure lion. Ligers are typically between 10 and 12feet in length, and can weigh between 800 and 1,000pounds or more.|$|E
50|$|It is various {{shades of}} gray all over, {{occasionally}} with a yellowish tint around its eye. Females have subtle <b>striping</b> <b>on</b> their back near their hindlimbs, and a <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> each flank. As Redonda is almost entirely treeless, the Redonda Anole spends most of its time {{on the ground and}} seeks shade under large rocks.|$|R
50|$|Previously, in 1986, the {{electronically}} generated BBC2 logo was updated. The number 2 {{was replaced}} with the word TWO. The letters were white, 3D letters on a white background with red <b>striping</b> <b>on</b> the T as well as green and blue <b>striping</b> <b>on</b> the W. The word TWO appeared and faded on the white background.|$|R

5|$|The only quagga to {{have been}} photographed alive was a mare at the Zoological Society of London's Zoo. Five {{photographs}} of this specimen are known, taken between 1863 and 1870. On the basis of photographs and written descriptions, many observers suggest that the <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> the quagga were light on a dark background, unlike other zebras. Reinhold Rau, pioneer of the Quagga Project, claimed {{that this is an}} optical illusion: that the base colour is a creamy white and that the stripes are thick and dark. Embryological evidence supports zebras being dark coloured with white as an addition.|$|E
5|$|The tiger (Panthera tigris) is {{the largest}} cat species, most {{recognizable}} for their pattern of dark vertical <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar, and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled {{with the fact that}} they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.|$|E
5|$|Their coat differs geographically, with elands {{in north}} Africa having {{distinctive}} markings (torso stripes, markings on legs, dark garters and a spinal crest) that are absent in the south. Apart from a rough mane, the coat is smooth. Females have a tan coat, while the coats of males are darker, with a bluish-grey tinge. Bulls {{may also have}} a series of vertical white <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> their sides (mainly in parts of the Karoo in South Africa). As males age, their coat becomes more grey. Males also have dense fur on their foreheads and a large dewlap on their throats.|$|E

50|$|The upperside of {{the body}} and wings is similar to Eumorpha satellitia satellitia but the ground colour is darker and more olive-green. There is a {{conspicuous}} dark <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> the head and thorax, running along the midline. There is a broad, dark edged, pale <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> the abdomen, running along the midline. The hindwing upperside inner margin is pink.|$|R
5|$|This {{species is}} often {{confused}} with the copperhead, A. contortrix. This {{is especially true for}} juveniles, but differences exist. A. piscivorus has broad, dark <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> the sides of its head that extend back from the eye, whereas A. contortrix has only a thin, dark line that divides the pale supralabials from the somewhat darker color of the head. The watersnakes of the genus Nerodia are also similar in appearance, being thick-bodied with large heads, but they have round pupils, no loreal pit, a single anal plate, subcaudal scales that are divided throughout, and a distinctive overall color pattern.|$|E
5|$|While most vocals are audible to {{the human}} ear, a captive leopard seal was {{recorded}} making ultrasonic calls underwater. In addition, the vocals of northern elephant seals may produce infrasonic vibrations. Non-vocal communication is not as common in pinnipeds as in cetaceans. Nevertheless, when disturbed by intruders harbor seals and Baikal seals may slap their fore-flippers against their bodies as warnings. Teeth chattering, hisses and exhalations are also made as aggressive warnings. Visual displays also occur: Weddell seals will make an S-shaped posture when patrolling under the ice, and Ross seals will display the <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> their chests and teeth when approached. Male hooded seals use their inflatable nasal membranes to display to and attract females.|$|E
5|$|After an enquiry {{into the}} {{problems}} with the airborne missions in Sicily, the British Army and Royal Air Force submitted some recommendations. Aircrew had to be trained in parachute and glider operations, and pathfinders landing before the main force had to have enough time to set out their beacons. The landing plan was simplified, with complete brigades landing on one drop zone, instead of the smaller battalion landing areas used in Sicily. Gliders were no longer released at night while still over water, and their landing zones would be large enough to accommodate the aircraft with room to spare. Following the friendly fire incident over the convoy, more training was given to ships' crews in aircraft recognition, and Allied aircraft were painted with three large white <b>stripes</b> <b>on</b> their wings. Training for pilots belonging to the Glider Pilot Regiment was increased, and improvements to the gliders were implemented, including better inter-aircraft communication.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ribbon of}} the Honour Badge of Labour is dark brown (to {{represent}} the earth) with one thin vertical orange <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> each side (representing fire). In addition, the ribbon of the Silver Badge has a thin silver <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> {{the inside of}} each orange stripe. This stripe is gold for the ribbon of the Gold Badge.|$|R
50|$|The medal is {{suspended}} by a ring through the award's suspension loop {{to a standard}} Russian pentagonal mount covered with a 24 mm wide overlapping tricolour silk moiré ribbon with a 10 mm wide green <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> the left, a 4 mm wide white stripe {{in the center and}} a 10 mm wide red <b>stripe</b> <b>on</b> the right.|$|R
