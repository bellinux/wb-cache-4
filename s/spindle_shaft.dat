Development of high-speed spindle technology is strategically {{critical to the}} implementation of high speed machining. Compared to conventional spindles, and motorized spindles are equipped with built-in motors for better power transmission and balance to achieve high-speed operation.

40|$|AbstractThe magnetoresistive (MR) sensing {{principle}} {{was first}} applied industrially in the read-heads of hard disc drives. However, {{in the past}} decade the MR effect has also been used successfully for sensors to measure position, current and magnetic fields. MR sensors offer a number of benefits compared to other technologies used for condition monitoring of machine spindles. They are more compact and offer a higher bandwidth than inductive or capacitive sensors. They are more robust than optical encoders, being largely insusceptible to oil, water and other contaminants [1]. MR sensors can be applied over a wider temperature range and with less demanding assembly tolerances. This makes them particularly well suited to applications with limited available space and demanding operating conditions, {{as is often the case}} in machine tool sensing applications. This paper explains the basics of magnetoresistive sensor technology and outlines the advantages compared to other sensor principles. Furthermore the results of a joint R&D project between Sensitec GmbH and the PTW Institute of the Technical University Darmstadt, funded by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft industrieller Forschungsvereinigungen “Otto von Guericke e.

40|$|High-speed {{machining}} (HSM) {{has become}} a critical manufacturing technology for industry to meet fierce international competition. Aerospace industry is {{the first and most}} successful in implementing HSM due to its use of aluminum and their very large size of parts which require very long machining time. ^ The main objective of this thesis is to develop a finite element dynamic model to characterize the mechanical and thermal influence on the dynamic behavior of the spindle-bearing system for high-speed end milling. The finite element spindle dynamic model is validated via a state-of-the-art high speed spindle/milling test bed. In particular, several systematic tests are also developed to enable the measurement of system natural frequencies at high speeds while the spindle is rotating at very high speeds. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, we conclude that: (1) System stiffness increases as the front bearing preload increases. (2) When the high-speed spindle is under appropriate cooling and lubrication conditions, the thermal preload of the spindle bearing increases due to its radial thermal expansions, resulting in higher bearing stiffness. (3) The system is softened due to the centrifugal effects of the <b>spindle</b> <b>shaft</b> when the bearing preload is kept constant. (4) The centrifugal effects are more significant to the system dynamics than the gyroscopic effects. (5) The system is softened mainly due to centrifugal effects of <b>spindle</b> <b>shaft,</b> instead of bearings. ^ The above results can be applied to lobe diagram for regenerative stability analysis, in which the centrifugal effects must be considered in the evaluation of a system 2 ̆ 7 s transfer function. It can also be applied to review the centrifugal effects based on the cutter receptance. This analysis is useful to assist the use of ISO 1940 / 1 standard. The proposed model can provide machine tool builders a design tool to estimate necessary bearing stiffness, bearing positions, bearing spacing, and system dynamics in their machine tool designs for different operating conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|Thin film sensor systems {{based on}} {{hydrogenated}} carbon {{have the advantage}} to combine two very important characteristics. They show a piezoresistive behaviour and also a tribological stability caused by a high hardness and wear resistance. Therefore they can be applied {{on the surface of}} machine parts or used for building up universal insertable sensor systems like sensory washers. A real challenge is the deposition of a whole sensory layer system on technical components like a spindle, which have a length of 480 mm and an outer diameter of about 90 mm. The functions of the layer system directly applied in the contact zone between <b>spindle</b> <b>shaft</b> and tool holder are the measurement of the clamping force of the tool holder, the imbalance of the used tool and the process forces during machining. For this application a self-contained thin film sensor system is investigated. Directly in the <b>spindle</b> <b>shaft</b> an insulating alumina layer is deposited in a thickness of about 4 µm followed by electrode structures out of 200 nm thin chromium coating. On top of this the piezoresistive hydrogenated carbon layer in a thickness of about 1 µm is deposited, covered by a wear resistant and insulating top coating. Therefore a silicon and oxygen modified carbon layer in a thickness of about 2 µm is used. The piezoresistive sensor layer and also the top layer are part of the diamond like carbon layer family [1, 2, 3, 4]. Another very important application is the sensory washer.
