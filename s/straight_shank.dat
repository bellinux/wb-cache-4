50|$|The {{triangle}} shank {{is almost}} always made by machining three flats on round bar stock. It is intended as a minor modification of a <b>straight</b> <b>shank,</b> still allowing it {{to be held in}} a 3-jaw drill chuck, but allowing higher torque transmission and limited slipping.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, the {{hallmarks}} are 'struck' using steel punches. Punches {{are made in}} different sizes, suitable for tiny pieces of jewelry to large silver platters. Punches are made in <b>straight</b> <b>shank</b> or ring shank, the latter used to mark rings. The problem with traditional punching is {{that the process of}} punching displaces metal, causing some distortion of the article being marked. This means that re-finishing of the article is required after hallmarking. For this reason, and that off-cuts from sprues are often used for assay, many articles are sent unfinished to the assay office for assay and hallmarking.|$|E
50|$|Most {{drill bits}} for {{consumer}} use have <b>straight</b> <b>shanks.</b> For heavy duty drilling in industry, bits with tapered shanks are sometimes used. Other types shanks used include hex-shaped, and various proprietary quick release systems.|$|R
50|$|For {{production}} machine tools, the shank type is usually {{one of the}} following: a standard taper (such as Morse or Brown & Sharpe), a <b>straight</b> round <b>shank</b> to be held by a collet, or a <b>straight</b> round <b>shank</b> with a flat for a set screw, to be held by a solid toolholder. For hand tools, the shank end is usually a square drive, intended for use with {{the same type of}} wrench used to turn a tap for the cutting of screw threads.|$|R
50|$|The cheek-shank angle also varies, {{with some}} {{straight}} up and down, others with the shanks curving backward, and some with an S-curve in the <b>shank.</b> The <b>straighter</b> the cheek-shank line is, the less signal is provided to the horse before the bit engages. Those that curve backward provide more of {{a signal to the}} horse. Therefore, the type of shank needs to be considered according {{to the use of the}} horse. Horses that maintain a more vertical head position, such as dressage horses, generally use a curb bit with <b>straight</b> <b>shanks.</b> Those that have a nose-out head position when working, such as cutting and roping horses, more commonly use a curved shank.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>straight</b> <b>shank</b> is {{the most}} usual style on modern drill bits, by number manufactured. The whole of the drill bit, shaft and shank, is usually of the same {{diameter}}. It is held usually in a 3-jaw drill chuck. Bits of diameter too small to grip firmly can have straight shanks of larger diameter than the drill, which can be held firmly in a standard size colet or chuck. Large drill bits can have straight shanks narrower than the drill diameter {{so that they can}} be fitted in chucks not able to chuck the full diameter. Such a drill bit is called a reduced-shank or blacksmith's drill. For example, this allows a 1/2" [...] bit to be used in a pistol-grip drill's 3/8" [...] chuck. One particular type of reduced-shank drill bits are Silver & Deming (S&D) bits, whose sets run from 9/16" [...] to 1-1/2" [...] drill body diameter with a standard 1/2" [...] reduced shank for all. This allows drill presses with 1/2" [...] chucks to run the larger drills. S&D bits are 6" [...] long with a 3" [...] flute length.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the optimum moisture content to subsoil based on tillage forces and soil disruption. Two different shanks, a <b>straight</b> <b>shank</b> and a “minimum−tillage ” shank, were tested in a Coastal Plain soil in the soil bins of the National Soil Dynamics Laboratory in Auburn, Alabama. A three−dimensional dynamometer measured tillage forces, and a laser profilometer measured soil disruption. Tillage forces and soil disruption measured in the driest soil condition were greatest. The “minimum−tillage ” shank required more energy and disrupted less surface soil than the <b>straight</b> <b>shank.</b> An index, the trench specific resistance (TSR), was developed to aid in determining the minimum amount of draft force necessary for maximally disrupting a deeper soil profile. Reduced values of TSR were found for the <b>straight</b> <b>shank</b> compared to the “minimum−tillage ” shank, as minimum draft produced maximum soil disturbance. Reduced values of TSR were also found for subsoiling operations conducted at all soil conditions other than the driest. Based on this research, subsoiling should not be conducted at the extreme driest soil condition due to increased draft forces and increased aboveground soil disruption...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Aboveground soil {{disruption}} {{prior to}} planting is avoided in conservation tillage systems {{due to the}} need to keep plant residue in place. However, belowground disruption is necessary in many Southeastern U. S. soils to ameliorate soil compaction problems. For use in conservation tillage systems, belowground soil disruption should be maximized while aboveground disruption should be minimized. To assist in choosing the best shank for strip-tillage systems which accomplish both objectives, comparisons were made between several shanks commonly used for conservation tillage systems to provide in-row subsoiling prior to planting. A tractor-mounted three-dimensional dynamometer was used to measure draft, vertical, and side forces in a Coastal Plain soil in Alabama. Three subsoiler systems were evaluated at different depths of operation: (i) Paratill � bentleg shanks, (ii) Terramax � bentleg shanks, and (iii) KMC <b>straight</b> <b>shanks.</b> A portable tillage profiler was used to measure both above- and belowground soil disruptions. Shallower subsoiling resulted in reduced subsoiling forces and reduced surface soil disturbance. The bentleg subsoilers provided maximum soil disruption and minimal surface disturbance and allowed surface residue to remain mostly undisturbed. Bentleg shanks provide optimum soil conditions for conservation systems by disrupting compacted soil profiles while leaving crop residues on the soil surface to intercept rainfall and prevent soil erosion...|$|R
5000|$|The cheek-to-shank angle also varies, {{with some}} {{straight}} up and down, others with the shanks curving backward. Some shanks have a dramatic S-curve. Cheek angle influences the angle at which the bit engages and thus way the horse carries its head. Therefore, the type of shank needs to be considered according {{to the use of}} the horse. Horses that maintain a more vertical head position, such as dressage horses and western horses trained in the [...] "straight up" [...] or Vaquero tradition generally use a curb bit with <b>straighter</b> <b>shanks.</b> Those that have a nose-out head position when working, such as cutting and roping horses, more commonly use a more curved shank. Shanks on certain western bits that curve back are sometimes called a [...] "grazing bit." [...] Though a horse should never be allowed to graze in a bridle, the term came from the mistaken notion that the turned-back shank was to allow the horse to eat with a bridle. In reality, the design simply allowed the horse to comfortably travel with its nose well ahead of the vertical. An S curve in a shank does not have a major effect on the angle at which the rein engages, but may alter the balance of the bit at the point the lever arm joins the mouthpiece.|$|R

40|$|Field efficiency, {{effective}} field capacity, fuel consumption per unit area, and specific fuel energy were estimated during tillage operation in sandy loam soil for three chisel plows with different shank shapes. An instrumented tractor {{was used in}} the experiments. The instrumentation system consisting of sensitive sensors and a data logger was used for measuring and recording tractor performance parameters such as fuel consumption, tractor forward speed and plowing depth. Performance parameters were measured at four forward speeds from 2. 7 to 6. 9 km/h for each plow, and the tillage depth during field operation was kept at a specific value for each plow, which ranged from 7. 1 cm to 9. 8 cm with an average of 8. 5 cm. For all the three plows, the results showed an inversal relationship between field efficiency and forward speed, and field efficiency values were close at each speed of the four forward speeds. Also, the results showed that there were differences in fuel consumption per unit area and specific fuel energy among the used plows, where the plow with semi <b>straight</b> <b>shanks</b> gave lower fuel consumption per unit area and specific fuel energy compared with the other two shanks, and the highest fuel energy values were for the plow with curved shanks.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering. The adhesively bonded layered {{aluminum}} {{is used in}} aircraft {{structures to}} avoid knife edge situations when flush head fasteners are used with minimum gage skins. Due to the countersunk hole and adhesive bonding, stress flow becomes more complicated. Extensive knowledge of the different parameters that affect {{the behavior of the}} bonded joints with countersunk holes is essential for dependable and effective design. A 3 -D finite element model was used to estimate the location and magnitude of stress concentration under remote tension for the aforementioned problem. The influence of the various parameters on stress concentration was investigated for a counter sunk angle of 100 º. Different parameters such as ratio of young‟s modulus of adhesive to aluminum, position of adhesive layer, countersunk sunk depths, ratio of thickness to radius and ratio of width to radius have been addressed in this study. The stress flow varies significantly when the plates are filled with fasteners of different pre-tension loads. Also the effects of pre-tension loading were compared for the cases of open hole and fastener filled hole without pre-tension for bonded, monolithic and <b>straight</b> <b>shank</b> hole. The results obtained from the finite element analysis for the monolithic cases have been validated against those reported in literature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{instrumented}} subsoiler shank {{was designed}} and built to measure the soil resistance while moving through the soil and for automatic control of the depth of several standard subsoiler shanks mounted on the same frame. Three load cells measure the resultant magnitude {{and direction of the}} soil reactions on the shank. Two load cells measure forces perpendicular to the <b>straight</b> <b>shank</b> with a constant distance between them and another load cell measures the force along the shank. The two perpendicular load cells are cantilevers with one side mounted {{to the center of the}} shank’s width and the other side connected to wheels running inside a hollow beam. The wheels enable the shank to be moved up and down for different depths with the aid of a hydraulic cylinder. The hydraulic cylinder is connected to the upper edge of the shank by the lengthwise load cell. The resultant force on the shank is calculated by using the three measured forces, their directions and locations. The instrumented shank was calibrated and tested in the field. While preliminary in nature, the results indicate that when the shank tip is above a soil hardpan, the soil force on the tip acts upward, and becomes negative when the shank tip is below the hardpan. These results indicate that it may be possible to determine the depth of the hardpan by observing when the vertical force on the shank tip passes through zero as the shan...|$|E
40|$|During machining, cutting forces exerted on a {{toolholder}} {{will cause}} its shank to bend within the spindle. If the shank 2 ̆ 7 s deflections {{are larger than}} the gap separating the two surfaces, impacting will occur. The repetitive impacting motion between the spindle and toolholder results in a fretting condition. Over time, this will lead to wear and corrosion damage that is costly to repair and can potentially affect machining performance. Typical means of dealing with fretting {{include the use of}} surface treatments such as coatings or the use of wear resistant materials. However, these are only treatments and not solutions. Although they may reduce fretting damage, they do not prevent the fretting condition. The proper solution would be to prevent the contact that causes the fretting. Through finite element simulations and experimental testing, modal analysis was performed on various toolholder designs. Since different designs will have different dynamic characteristics, the goal was to find those designs that would minimize shank deflections, and thus minimize fretting damage. Two types of toolholders were studied: <b>straight</b> <b>shank</b> and tapered shank. The design of each was altered by varying the overall length and diameter. Within typical operating frequencies, it was generally found that shank deflections were less in tapered designs than in straight designs and that the deflections decreased as the length of the toolholder decreased. Increasing the diameter had no significant effect on deflections. By understanding how design modifications can affect shank deflections, a toolholder can be created to minimize the chance of fretting. Dept. of Mechanical, Automotive, and Materials Engineering.

40|$|The {{best way}} to {{extend the life of}} a {{metalworking}} fluid (MWF) is to make sure the machine tool and MWF delivery system are properly cleaned at least once per year. The dilemma the MWF manager is faced with is: How does one clean the machine tool and the MWF system on a large machine tool with an enclosure in a timely manner without impacting production schedules? Remember the walls and roof of the machine enclosure are coated with a film of dried contaminated MWF that must also be removed. If not removed, the deposits on these surfaces can recontaminate the fresh charge of MWF. I have found a product that with this revised procedure helps to shorten the machine tool down time involved with machine cleaning. (1) Discuss with your MWF supplier if they have a machine cleaning product that can be used with your current water based MWF during normal machining operations. Most MWF manufacturers have a machine cleaner that can be used at a lower concentration (1 - 2 % vs. 5 %) and can be used while still making production parts {{for a short period of}} time (usually 24 - 48 hours). (2) Make sure this machine cleaner is compatible with the work-piece material you are machining into product. Most cleaners are compatible with ferrous alloys. Because of the increased alkalinity of the fluid you might experience staining if you are machining copper or aluminum alloys. (3) Remove the chips from the chips pans and fluid channels. (4) During off shift hours circulate the MWF using a new product marketed by Rego-Fix called a 'Hydroball'. This device has a 5 / 8 inch diameter <b>straight</b> <b>shank</b> which allows it to be installed in any collet or solid quick change tool holder. It has multiple nozzles so that the user can control the spray pattern generated when the MWF is circulated. It allows the user to utilize the high pressure, through spindle MWF delivery capability of your machine tool for cleaning purposes. The high pressure MWF system can now be effectively used for cleaning purposes. This will also work with standard pressure system but you must reduce the number of nozzles utilized. By combining the movement of the machine axis around the operating envelope and the MWF circulation you can do a reasonably effective job of washing the inside of the machine tool operating cavity. Way covers will be moved and surfaces exposed because of axis movement. Spray direction will change to better wash fixtures and machine tool components. Deposits will start to breakdown and be washed into the machine tool sump. Since the cycle will run four or more hours it can be done with a weaker cleaning solution. The distributor states that the unit can be rotated up to 50 RPM. When running it has the same effect as the washing rotor inside of your home dishwasher. Inside the cavity on a machining center there is a lot of splash. During normal operations, MWF deposits buildup on the walls and roof of the enclosures. If these deposits (containing bacteria, mold and other contaminants) are not removed they will inoculate the fresh charge of MWF when they are resaturated. When you clean the inside of machine tool cavity, time is spent removing these deposits on the walls and roof of the enclosure. Getting to these surfaces is very difficult usually requiring that a member of the cleaning crew get inside the machine tool to reach them. The Hydro ball is effective in distributing the cleaning solution on all surfaces of the enclosure under high pressure. The only negative we have found is you get to find all the gaps and leaks in your machine tool enclosure. By running the hydro ball with the machine cleaner enriched MWF during off shift (4 - 8 hours) you can effectively remove these deposits and buildups on the internal surfaces of the cavity of the machine tool and wash them down into the sump. You also clean the internal components of the MWF system without interrupting normal scheduled work. (5) Pump out the spent MWF. You will have found that most of the deposits have been washed from the internal surfaces of the enclosure. For extremely dirty machines you might have to refill the machine tool with the normal machine cleaner mix. You will find that even heavy deposits will break down quicker because of this pre-wash cycle. (6) Rinse the machine cavity. (7) Clean the walls, bottom and screens in the MWF reservoir. The use of this tool and the dilute machine cleaner reduced the cleaning time considerately without affecting production schedules. (8) Refill with MWF and resume normal operations. What we like about this system is we can schedule these light cleanings just before a scheduled fluid change. Add the cleaner to the mix and run the Hydroball on second shift. The spent fluid is pumped out on third shift and the machine refilled. The machine tool with a fresh charge of MWF is ready for first shift without interrupting production schedules. We get better life from our MWFs and the machinists are happier about the condition of their machines...|$|E
40|$|The two {{historical}} fuselage failures, Comet in 1954 and Aloha in 1988, {{illustrate that}} similar accidents must be avoided {{which requires a}} profound understanding of the fatigue mechanisms involved, including analytical models to predict the fatigue behavior of riveted joints of a fuselage structure. The scope of the research project covers a variety of joint types and joining techniques for both monolithic and laminated sheet materials. The fuselage structure is a rather complicated system of parts consisting of skin sheets, tear straps, stringers, frames and doublers. These parts are interconnected by mechanically fastened and bonded joints, {{or a combination of}} both. The complex fuselage structure in the present research is reduced to specimen level size for laboratory testing and theoretical analysis. The major topics of the thesis are: Calculations of the combined tension and bending stress distribution in joints, which implies an extension of the so-called secondary bending model (Chapter 3). Find a direct and simple relation between the formed rivet head and squeeze force. (Chapter 4). Development of stress intensity factors for fatigue cracks in joints loaded under combined tension and application to fatigue crack growth results (Chapter 5). Fractographic observations with the scanning electron microscope of crack front shapes occurring in riveted joints under combined tension and bending (Chapter 5). Analysis of the residual strength of joints with fatigue cracks (Chapter 6). Neutral line model For mechanically fastened lap splice and butt joints in a fuselage structure, a dominant load is introduced by the Ground Air Ground (GAG) pressurization cycle. The hoop load is transferred from one skin panel to the next via the fasteners in the joint. The hoop load is offset by eccentricities in the load path, which causes secondary bending. The bending stress is a non-linear function of the applied tension load. The stress system in the joint then encompasses the membrane stress, the secondary bending stress and the bearing stress associated with the fastener loads on the holes. The secondary bending is highly depending on the magnitude of the eccentricity and the flexural rigidity of the joint between the fastener rows. The theory used to derive the bending stresses is based on the advanced beam theory. A further development of the neutral line model incorporates the internal moment, which is a useful representation of the load transfer occurring in multiple row joints. The calculation of the load transfer can be made for complicated lap splice and butt joints. With the developments of the present research, the neutral line model is still a very powerful tool to use {{in the early stages of}} joint design. It gives a good picture of the stresses in a joint. Riveting Solid rivets and more advanced fasteners are still widely used in aircraft fuselage design efforts. The fasteners are characterized by various parameters associated with the fastener material and geometry, sheet material and installation process. The present investigation focuses on solid rivets installed in aluminum and Glare. The expansion of a solid rivet in a rivet hole is important with respect to the fatigue properties of joints. The expanding rivet inside a fastener hole will create a compressive residual stress around the hole and this will delay fatigue crack nucleation. It is important to know the correct squeeze force used to form the driven head of a rivet. Measurements of the formed rivet head (diameter or protruding height) can be used to obtain information about the applied squeezing force. The riveting process is a non linear deformation process characterized by large plastic strains. Simple equations based on constant volume of the rivet and the Holloman model for uniform plastic deformation, were adopted to evaluate the riveting process. Useful results were obtained about the correlation between the rivet head deformation and the applied squeezing force. Stress intensity factors As a result of combined tension and secondary bending in a lap joint, fatigue cracks at the edge of a hole start at one side of the sheet only. Initially these cracks at the edge of a hole are growing as a part through the thickness corner crack, which later become a through the thickness crack, a so called through crack. But also for a through crack, the shape of the crack front is usually curved and the crack length measured at both sides of the sheet will be different. In view of fatigue crack growth predictions it then is necessary to obtain stress intensity factors for such slant and curved crack fronts. In the present investigation this problem has been explored for a simple configuration, which is an open hole in a sheet specimen subjected to combined tension and bending. Fatigue tests were carried out on specimens of AL 2024 T 3 clad sheet material with three different thicknesses (1. 0, 1. 6 and 2. 0 mm). In each specimen a single open countersunk hole was present. The development of the crack front is these specimens could be recorded because so-called marker load cycles were applied in these tests. It then was possible to observe the crack fronts in the scanning electron microscope, which still was a rather strenuous work. Reconstruction of the crack growth could be done for the larger part of the fatigue cracks. K-values were obtained for a large variety of crack front shapes and crack sizes. Comparison of the new calculated K values with existing solutions showed that the new solutions capture near the surface phenomenon more accurately than the previously published data. The improvement is a result of using an increased mesh density. For through the thickness cracks growing away from the countersunk hole, the normalized stress intensity factors approach the values of the normalized stress intensity factors for cracks emanating from a <b>straight</b> <b>shank</b> hole. Thus, the effect of the countersunk hole decreases with increasing crack length. The solutions for the pin loading b values show a dominant influence of the countersunk shape in the b/t values. Residual strength Static failure of a joint occurs when that joint is not able to carry the applied load anymore. The type of static failure in joints depends on the loading condition and the joint configuration. The most common static failure modes in monolithic aluminum joints are fastener shear failure, plate tension failure, bearing failure and plate shear failure. In Glare joints another failure mechanism, fastener pull-through, is often observed. This failure mechanism is related to the lower stiffness of Glare in thickness direction, leading to increased tilting of the fasteners and hence increased tensile stresses in the fastener. In the present thesis, a method is proposed to calculate the residual strength of joints of monolithic and fiber metal laminates. The method uses the remaining net section. For the fiber metal laminates the net section includes the remaining intact metal layers in combination with the intact fibers. The method starts with the blunt notch strength of the un cracked joint and the metal volume fraction for the fiber-metal laminates. The Norris failure criterion and the metal volume fraction are used to calculate the blunt notch strength for any possible Glare lay up. Secondary bending has a significant influence on the ultimate strength of both Glare and aluminum. The ultimate tensile strength reduces with increasing bending. Taking this into account, an empirically found reduction of 10...|$|E
