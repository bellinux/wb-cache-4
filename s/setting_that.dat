He felt the story would be a difficult component, as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward, or otherwise build the story around a new character. However, one option he has considered to alleviate the issue is by creating an adventure game using an open-world mechanic similar to the Grand Theft Auto series.|$|E

5|$|The Hickmans {{began work}} on Ravenloft in the late 1970s, intent on {{creating}} a frightening portrait of a vampire in a <b>setting</b> <b>that</b> combined Gothic horror with the D game system. They play-tested the adventure {{with a group of}} players each Halloween for five years before it was published. Strahd has since appeared in a number of D accessories and novels. The module has inspired numerous revisions and adaptations, including a campaign setting of the same name and a sequel. In 1999, on the 25th anniversary of Dungeons & Dragons, two commemorative versions of Ravenloft were released.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} on Why Don't You?, Davies oversaw the {{production}} of a story that took place in Loch Ness. The story was the precursor for his first freelance children's project: Dark Season. The show, originally called The Adventuresome Three, would feature the Why Don't You? characters in a purely dramatic <b>setting</b> <b>that</b> was influenced by his childhood. He submitted the script {{to the head of the}} BBC's Children's department, Anna Home, and Granada Television. Both companies were interested in producing the show with minor changes: Granada wished to produce it as one six-part serial, as opposed to Davies' plan of two three-part serials; and Home was interested in accepting the show on the condition it included a new cast of characters. He accepted Home's offer, and the show was allocated the budget and timeslot of Maid Marian and her Merry Men, which had been put on hiatus the year before.|$|E
