For the first time, through increasing the reverse bias voltage to pn junctions, the lower substrate eddy loss {{due to the}} pn junction substrate isolation is reliably validated and the maximum quality factor is improved by 19 %. The inductor without substrate shielding layer is compared to the inductor with metal one pattern ground <b>shielding,</b> <b>pattern</b> n-well, n + diffusion, dual pn junctions isolation.

40|$|By {{employing}} the lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) {{with respect to}} Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) collision model, a 2 -D computational study is performed to investigate the flow structures, force coefficients and vortex-shedding characteristics behind a single-square cylinder and two side-by-side cylinders at different spacing conditions (1. 0  ⩽ T/D ⩽  4. 5). The flow patterns around the square cylinders are determined using the contour plot. Significant observations from this study are as follows: (a) a flip flop regime is observed for T/D =  1. 0, whereas a wiggling/Flutter <b>shielding</b> <b>pattern</b> is observed at T/D =  3. 5 and a synchronized flow pattern is observed for the spacing ratio of T/D =  4. 5, (b) the frequencies observed for the smaller spacing ratios (T/D =  1. 0; 3. 5) having numerous peaks in the spectra. Subsequently the frequencies were observed at T/D =  4. 5 having a single dominating peak frequency, (c) the main motivation for the significant variation in flow patterns {{is due to the}} changes in mean drag coefficients, root mean square values of the aerodynamic coefficients and Strouhal number, (d) it is observed that the formation of vortex strongly depends on the spacing ratios between the cylinders. From the results, it is identified that the cylinders at higher spacing ratios (T/D =  4. 5) produce minimum oscillation when compared to the smaller spacing ratios...|$|E

The dual-mode sensing capability {{is achieved by}} utilizing inter-pixel <b>shielding</b> <b>patterns</b> as capacitive amplifier’s input electrodes. A prototype readout circuit including a fingerprint panel for feasibility verification was fabricated in a 0. 18 mm CMOS process. A single-channel readout circuit was implemented and multiplexed to scan two- dimensional fingerprint pixels, where adaptive calibration capability against pixel-capacitance variations was also implemented. Feasibility of the proposed multi-purpose interface was experimentally verified keeping low-power consumption less than 1. 9 mW under a 3. 3 V supply. clos...|$|R

Isotropic shielding calculations are used as one method of investigation {{for the first time}} in organometallic compounds. New interactions are discussed, including halogen bonding in transition states. 	A second investigation has been performed into the nature of the chemical bond in dicarbon. Isotropic shielding calculations both along the molecular axis and in the molecular plane provide new insights into the order of the bond and the extent to which the centres are hybridised according to valence bond theory. Ionic species are discussed, with the doubly positive dinitrogen ion displaying almost identical <b>shielding</b> <b>patterns</b> to dicarbon...|$|R

The Doctor and Romana venture out to discover the remains of an enormous egg in the jungle, and when they meet the inhabitants they find a matriarchy ruled through fear by the icy and callous Lady Adrasta. Without metal to make the tools {{needed to keep the}} jungle under control, lush plant life dominates. The Lady Adrasta controls the planet's very last metal mine, holding on to power through the Huntsman and the Wolfweeds.

5000|$|Hoskins, who is African American, is {{persuaded by}} another black man that [...] "Bucky" [...] is a demeaning title, since American slaveholders often {{referred}} to male slaves as [...] "bucks". Consequently, Hoskins takes on the identity of Battlestar, wearing a new costume and wielding a <b>shield</b> <b>patterned</b> after the one Steve Rogers originally carried. Captain America and Battlestar capture Quill but are defeated in combat by his team, the Resistants. They then fight and defeat Demolition Man. Battlestar witnesses the Flag-Smasher's capture of Captain America. Battlestar persuades Rogers, the original Captain America, to help him rescue Walker from the Flag-Smasher, and they battle ULTIMATUM. Battlestar then witnesses the faked assassination of Walker, and leaves the Commission's employ. He confronts Dr. Valerie Cooper and learns that Walker is still alive. Battlestar meets the Falcon and aids him in battling Coachwhip, Puff Adder, and Rock Python of the Serpent Society.|$|R

Two web site holds much information on his skills of rainforest aboriginal artifacts making:http://earthsci.org/aboriginal/Ngadjonji%20History/food/weapons/Making%20a%20Shield.htm http://earthsci.org/aboriginal/index.htmlSome of these Photos were taken by historian Duncan Ray who, for many years, documented Georges skills for the Eacham Historical Society. George Davis (Nungabana)http://www.wettropics.gov.au/wwc/wwc_casawards01.html was a Mullunburra Yidinji Edler who was a living encyclopaedia on the Aboriginal culture of his tribal land - the World Heritage-listed Wet Tropics Area of the Mulgrave Valley and up onto the Atherton Tableland in north Queensland. George wanted to pass his traditional knowledge on to younger people, and actively did so. Duncan Ray is a non-Indigenous historian and artist who recorded the skills and techniques George used to make the tribes varied traditional swords and shields. George and Duncan worked together creating several swords and shields, and were both members of the Tableland Reconciliation Group.
