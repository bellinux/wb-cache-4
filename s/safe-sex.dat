25|$|LGBT persons faced {{widespread}} discrimination, as well {{as police}} harassment and extortion attempts. Gay men in prison were often subjected to sexual and other physical abuse. In March a gang of men assaulted nine people they believed to be LGBT individuals in Jamestown, a neighborhood of Accra, forcing them {{from their homes and}} attacking them with canes and sticks. The victims filed a complaint with a legal human rights organization. They said their homes were burgled while they were chased out. No arrests had been made in the case by year's end. In May a peer educator employed by an NGO to instruct sexual health education workshops was assaulted by a group of boys at a school in the Volta Region. The assault occurred after they discovered he was carrying <b>safe-sex</b> presentation materials such as condoms, wooden sex organ replicas, lubricant, and pamphlets.The peer educator was detained by police but later released. The boys were not charged.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Where Life Begins", Madonna {{promises}} to teach [...] "a {{different kind of}} kiss" [...] to the listener. In the song, Madonna talks about the pleasures of oral sex and also references <b>safe-sex.</b> The sixth track is [...] "Bad Girl". It talks {{about a woman who}} would rather get drunk than end a relationship she is too neurotic to handle. The seventh song, [...] "Waiting", {{has been described as a}} [...] "yearning ballad." [...] Featuring spoken words, it addresses rejection and unrequited love. It ends with lyrics [...] "The next time you want pussy, just look in the mirror, baby." [...] The next track, [...] "Thief of Hearts", is a dark and rumbling song. It uses tough hip-hop language to ward off a rival for her lover's attention. It opens with the smashing of a glass, and Madonna shouting, [...] "Bitch!/Which leg do you want me to break?" [...] and later, she sneers, [...] "Little miss thinks she can have his child/Well anybody can do it." [...] "Words" [...] was compared to the previous track [...] "Thief of Hearts," [...] with music critics finding similarity in scope, each with sharp lyrics and catchy beats. The song features clattering programs and icy synth block-chords.|$|E
2500|$|Same-sex {{relationships}} are similarly affected by HIV/AIDS status in domestic violence. Research by Heintz and Melendez found that same-sex individuals {{may have difficulty}} breaching the topic of <b>safe-sex</b> for reasons such as [...] "decreased perception of control over sex, fear of violence, and unequal power distributions..." [...] Of those who reported violence in the study, about 50% reported forced sexual experiences, of which only half reported the use of safe sex measures. Barriers to safer-sex included fear of abuse, and deception in <b>safe-sex</b> practices. Heintz and Melendez's research ultimately concluded that sexual assault/abuse in same-sex relationships provides a major concern for HIV/AIDS infection as it decreases instances of <b>safe-sex.</b> Furthermore, these incidents create additional fear and stigma surrounding <b>safe-sex</b> conversations and knowing ones STD status.|$|E

2500|$|People in {{same-sex}} relationships face special {{obstacles in}} dealing with the issues that some researchers have labeled [...] "the double closet". A 1997 Canadian study by Mark W. Lehman suggests similarities include frequency (approximately one in every four couples); manifestations (emotional, physical, financial, etc.); co-existent situations (unemployment, substance abuse, low self-esteem); victims' reactions (fear, feelings of helplessness, hypervigilance); and reasons for staying (love, can work it out, things will change, denial). Studies conducted by Emory University in 2014 identified 24 trigger for partner violence through web-based surveys, ranging from drugs and alcohol to <b>safe-sex</b> discussions. A general theme of power and control seems to underlie abuse in both heterosexual and homosexual relationships.|$|E
2500|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in 2009 to gather information about knowledge and adoption of the HPV vaccine. Thirty percent of 13- to 17-year-olds and 9% of 18- to 26-year-olds out of the total 1,011 young women surveyed reported receipt {{of at least one}} HPV injection. Knowledge about HPV varied; however, 5% or fewer subjects believed that the HPV vaccine precluded the need for regular cervical cancer screening or <b>safe-sex</b> practices. [...] Few girls and young women overestimate the protection provided by the vaccine. Despite moderate uptake, many females at risk of acquiring HPV have not yet received the vaccine. For example, young black women are less likely to receive HPV vaccines compared to young white women. Additionally, young women of all races and ethnicities without health insurance are less likely to initiate vaccine uptake.|$|E

50|$|Some groups, such as some Christian denominations, oppose sex outside {{marriage}} and therefore object to <b>safe-sex</b> education programs {{because they believe}} that providing such education promotes promiscuity. Virginity pledges and sexual abstinence education programs are often promoted in lieu of contraceptives and <b>safe-sex</b> education programs. This may entail exposing some teenagers to increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, because about 60 percent of teenagers who pledge virginity until marriage do engage in pre-marital sex and are then one-third less likely to use contraceptives than their peers who have received more conventional sex education.|$|E

50|$|HIV/AIDS in Swaziland {{was first}} {{reported}} in 1986 but has since reached epidemic proportions {{due in large}} part to cultural beliefs which discourage <b>safe-sex</b> practices.

50|$|The HIV {{epidemic}} {{prevalent in}} Nepal is especially concentrated among the meti community. This {{can be attributed}} to the unique struggle that Meti face finding employment and acceptance in society. Many meti are pushed into the sex-industry working as prostitutes and are unwelcome in any other roles in society. As with issues of discrimination, the key to starting to solve the HIV epidemic among meti is making knowledge readily available and educating about <b>safe-sex</b> methods.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, Diouf {{began an}} anti-AIDS program in Senegal, before the virus {{was able to}} take off in earnest. He used the media and schools to promote <b>safe-sex</b> {{messages}} and required prostitutes to be registered. He also encouraged civic organizations and both Christian and Muslim religious leaders to raise awareness about AIDS. The result was that while AIDS was decimating much of Africa, the infection rate for Senegal stayed below 2 percent.|$|E

50|$|Missy, {{overweight}} and utterly inexperienced at acting and public sex, reportedly had much difficulty performing {{in front of}} the film crew; the set was so tense that at one point Jim Mitchell harangued one of his O'Farrell managers in front of everyone because their catered lunch was inadequate. The Green Door sequel was also the world's first <b>safe-sex</b> film, in which all the men wore condoms, and self-protection advice was given to the audience by one of the characters. Highly over-budgeted at $250,000, Behind the Green Door: the Sequel, according to adult magazines, {{was one of the worst}} porn pictures ever made, mainly due to the absence of a professional cast.|$|E
50|$|In {{the later}} 1990s and early 2000s media {{announced}} a dangerous sense of malaise and complacency {{in the gay}} community generally over <b>safe-sex</b> practices. AIDS was becoming more “normalized”, risky sexual practices were increasing and gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia cases all rose. A combination of effectiveness in anti-retroviral therapies and increase in use of intravenous drugs influenced a rise in sexually transmitted infections (STI). In early 1999, King County Public Health reported an “alarming” increase in sexually transmitted infections amongst {{men who have sex}} with men. The “watershed moment” occurred in 2003 when King County Public Health released a report saying that STI had increased in gay/bisexual men by 40% over the past year.|$|E

The Red Umbrella Project points to the fear of condoms as being used as evidence of prostitution along with profiling of race and gender by police officers where: [...] "Women and trans people having condoms on them is criminalized, whereas a white cis male having condoms on him is looked at as <b>safe-sex</b> practice." ...|$|E
