50|$|There {{are also}} rings with a square profile, {{commonly}} called square-cuts, lathe cuts, or Square rings. When O-rings were selling {{at a premium}} because of the novelty, lack of efficient manufacturing processes and high labor content, Square rings were introduced as an economical substitution for O-rings. The square ring is typically manufactured by molding an elastomer sleeve which is then lathe-cut. This style of seal is sometimes less expensive to manufacture with certain materials and molding technologies (compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding), especially in low volumes. The physical sealing performance of square rings in static applications is superior to that of O-rings, however in dynamic applications it is inferior to that of O-rings. Square rings are usually only used in dynamic applications as energizers in cap <b>seal</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Square rings can also {{be more difficult to}} install than O-rings.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic liquid rotary seals {{operate with}} no {{maintenance}} and extremely low leakage {{in a very}} wide range of applications. Ferrofluid-based seals used in industrial and scientific applications are most often packaged in mechanical <b>seal</b> <b>assemblies</b> called rotary feedthroughs, which also contain a central shaft, ball bearings and an outer housing. The ball bearings provide two important functions: maintaining the shaft's centering within the seal gap, and supporting external loads. The bearings are the only mechanical wear-items, as the dynamic seal is actually a series of rings made of ultra-low vapor pressure, oil-based liquid held magnetically between the rotor and stator. Therefore, the operating life and equipment maintenance cycles are generally very long, and the drag torque very low. The magnet material is permanently charged and requires no electrical power or other re-energizing or maintenance. Ferrofluid-sealed feedthroughs reach performance levels that other technologies can't achieve, by optimizing features such as ferrofluid viscosity and magnetic strength, magnet and steel materials, bearing arrangements, and water cooling for applications with extremely high speeds or temperatures. Ferrofluid-sealed feedthroughs routinely operate in environments including ultra-high vacuum (below 10−8 mbar), temperatures over 1,000 °C, {{tens of thousands of}} RPM, and multiple-atmosphere pressures.|$|E
40|$|MODEL FOR WESTINGHOUSE PWRS, ” DECEMBER 2000. The {{purpose of}} this {{memorandum}} is to inform the Standardized Plant Analysis Risk (SPAR) model users and other agency risk analysts {{about the implications of}} using the “Rhodes Model” to model reactor coolant pump (RCP) seal loss-of-coolant accidents (LOCAs). The SPAR models are used in analyses that support regulatory activities, such as: (1) the Significance Determination Process (SDP) in the Reactor Oversight Process, (2) enforcement actions which are based on risk significance, (3) risk-informed reviews of license amendments, and (4) the Accident Sequence Precursor (ASP) Program. We are providing this information because the Rhodes Model is different from the RCP seal LOCA model incorporated in the SPAR models at the present time. For Westinghouse RCP <b>seal</b> <b>assemblies,</b> the SPAR models use RCP seal LOCA models developed to support NUREG- 1150 “Severe Accident Risks: An Assessment for Five U. S. Nuclear Plants. ” For non-Westinghouse RCP <b>seal</b> <b>assemblies,</b> the SPAR models use a model developed in the ASP Program (NUREG/CR- 4674, Vol. 21, Appendix H) using operating experience. Under some circumstances, using the Rhodes Model will yield significant differences in the probabilistic risk assessment results.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is {{developing}} a Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) for future exploration missions. The mechanism is a new state-of-the-art device for in-space assembly of structures and rendezvous of vehicles. At the interface between two pressurized modules, each with {{a version of the}} LIDS attached, a composite elastomer-metal seal assembly prevents the breathable air from escaping into the vacuum of space. Attached to the active LIDS, this seal mates against the passive LIDS during docking operation. The main interface seal assembly must exhibit low leak and outgas values, must be able to withstand various harsh space environments, must remain operational over a range of temperatures from - 50 C to 75 C, and perform after numerous docking cycles. This paper presents results from a comprehensive study of the mechanical performance of four candidate subscale seal assembly designs at - 50, 23, 50, and 75 C test temperatures. In particular, the force required to fully compress the seal during docking, and that which is required for separation during the undocking operation were measured. The height of subscale main interface seal bulbs, as well as the test temperature, were shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the forces the main interface seal of the LIDS may experience during docking and undocking operations. The average force values required to fully compress each of the <b>seal</b> <b>assemblies</b> were shown to increase with test temperature by approximately 50 % from - 50 to 75 C. Also, the required compression forces were shown to increase as the height of the seal bulb was increased. The seal design with the tallest elastomer seal bulb, which was 31 % taller than that with the shortest bulb, required force values approximately 45 % higher than those for the shortest bulb, independent of the test temperature. The force required to separate the seal was shown to increase with decreasing temperature after 15 hours of simulated docking. No adhesion force was observed at 75 C, while magnitudes of up to 235 lbf were recorded at the refrigerated temperature. In addition, the adhesion force was observed to increase with bulb height. When compared with the LIDS program requirements, the measured compression force values were found to be below the maximum allowable load allotted to the main interface seal. However, the measured adhesion force values at the refrigerated test temperature were found to exceed the program limits...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringAn {{increased}} {{frequency of}} minor gas leakages from seals in the wellhead (WH) area {{have been detected}} and recently given an increased focus among companies on the Norwegian continental shelf. Among others have Statoil and Shell reported concerns regarding this problem and are working simultaneously to identify and solve the problem. There is however uncertainties in the industry related to how the problem regarding leakages in the WH can be solved, how critical the leakages actually are, the extend of the problem, and whether test of the seals actually can trigger a leakage itself or not. Questions regarding whether the seals should be tested on a general basis and regarding specific maintenance plans for the seals have been raised. It {{has not been a}} common practice over the last years to test the seals in the WH after installation. It is therefore difficult to evaluate the extent of this problem as very limited test data exist. In addition, integrity issues in connection to the small cavities in the WH do often show unambiguous test results. Three case studies of three wells at the Oseberg East installation (Statoil) will be presented in this thesis. The case studies have been carried out {{with the use of the}} exclusion methods, analysis of pressure and trends, tests results, and simulations of hypothetic scenarios. The main discoveries follow below: It is indicated that the leakages in the <b>seal</b> <b>assemblies</b> in the WH are caused by: •	Design capabilities exceeded in operation •	Unsuccessful conversion of producers with an inactive A-annulus to producers with gas lift. •	Dirt and residual hydraulic oil from installation. •	Problems related to vibration •	Pressure tests of the DHSV •	Faulty design of WH A review of the barriers on the wells concludes that the wells have in the first place two independent barriers that are possible to test. An additional third barrier gives increased safety against leakages to the atmosphere if seals fail. It is not possible to test the seal in the third barrier without introducing a risk to damage a unidirectional seal in the secondary barrier. It is considered that the frequency of the leakages to the atmosphere is expected to increase with time. It is in particular expected that the total number of leakages will increase through the test ports. The consequences of these leakage rates are considered to be negligible compared with the rates of leakages that are considered to give high risk of explosion and/or fire. The leakages might however be of significant enough size to be detected by the gas-detector and thereby cause the production at the installation to be shut down. The test ports should be monitored and an increased focus on maintenance should be initiated. With these initiatives, leaks to the environment are considered to represent a negligible risk. It is a severe escalation of the leakage to cavities in the wellhead, if the consequence is that the unidirectional seal in the secondary barrier becomes weakened. This danger is reduced by being able to monitor the pressure between the elastomer seal and the unidirectional seal. Examples of recommended compensating measures that will be discussed are: •	Pressure monitoring •	Use of foam around test plugs •	Use of chemical sealant •	Evaluate injection of nitrogen to cavities It is recommended to bleed of pressure in the WH cavities before performing test on DHSV or commencement of other well activities. New recommended accept criteria’s in the WH follows: •	Operate the well with a 35 bar limit in the cavities •	AC. for leakages : o	 35 bar/ 24 hr for internal leakages o	 0, 1 kg/s for leakages to the atmosphere The case studies that have been carried out are related to gas lift wells. There is however indication that minor gas leakages in the WH might exist on other types of wells as well...|$|E
