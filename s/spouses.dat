50|$|Evidence as <b>spouse</b> {{of foreign}} origin of {{a citizen of}} India or <b>spouse</b> of foreign origin of an OCI Cardholder can be {{provided}} {{in the form of}} a registered marriage certificate. In the case of <b>spouse</b> of an Indian citizen, a copy of the Indian Passport of the <b>spouse</b> or copy of the Domicile Certificate or Nativity Certificate issued by the Competent Authority in respect of the Indian <b>spouse</b> or any other proof substantiating the status of the <b>spouse</b> as being an Indian citizen.

50|$|QTIP trusts are {{commonly}} used when a <b>spouse</b> has children from another marriage. The other <b>spouse</b> may wish to provide for this <b>spouse</b> {{and take advantage of}} the <b>spouse's</b> unified credit against gift and estate tax, but nonetheless designate where the money will go after that <b>spouse</b> is deceased. A QTIP trust allows this to be accomplished in a manner treated as a gift to a <b>spouse.</b>|$|R
5|$|Income from {{self-employment}} {{and wages}} of single individuals {{in excess of}} $200,000 annually are subject to an additional tax of 0.9%. The threshold amount is $250,000 for a married couple filing jointly (threshold applies to joint compensation of the two <b>spouses),</b> or $125,000 for a married person filing separately.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities or during conversations with friends or family members, {{people are more likely}} to address the risk of HIV contraction with their <b>spouses.</b> In addition, women are more likely than men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their <b>spouses</b> are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E

50|$|A <b>spouse</b> {{is a life}} {{partner in}} a holy matrimony, marriage, civil union, {{domestic}} partnership or common-law marriage. The term is gender neutral, whereas a male <b>spouse</b> is a husband and a female <b>spouse</b> is a wife. Although a <b>spouse</b> {{is a form of}} significant other, the latter term also includes non-marital partners who play a social role similar to that of a <b>spouse,</b> but do not have rights and duties reserved by law to a <b>spouse.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{some cases}} a <b>spouse</b> can prevent a fault divorce by convincing {{the court that}} he or she is not at fault. There are four types of {{defenses}} that are commonly used to prevent a fault divorce. The first defense, condonation, is used as a defense when the accusing <b>spouse</b> claims that the filing <b>spouse</b> has actually forgiven or accepted the wrongful behavior of their <b>spouse</b> prior to filing the charges and has in fact continued to have relations with them. Likewise, reconciliation, like condonation, is used by the accused <b>spouse</b> to prevent a fault divorce when they can prove that the filing <b>spouse</b> has forgiven them and reconciliation has occurred. Recrimination occurs when the <b>spouse</b> being accused of wrongdoing attempts to stop the divorce process by claiming that the other <b>spouse</b> is guilty of bad behavior themselves. Lastly, provocation is used when the <b>spouse</b> accused of abandoning the marriage defends the suit on the ground that the filing <b>spouse</b> provoked the abandonment.|$|R

5|$|Arias had a Cuban-born wife, Teresa, whom {{he married}} in 1964 {{and with whom}} he had four children. In the 1960s, she broke new ground for {{political}} <b>spouses</b> by attending political rallies and campaigning actively for her husband. Because Endara was a widower, she also acted as Panama's First Lady until Endara remarried to Ana Mae Diaz Chen in 1990.|$|E
5000|$|Abandonment may be {{actual or}} constructive. Actual {{abandonment}} is usually one <b>spouse</b> leaving the marital residence {{without the consent}} of the other <b>spouse</b> without intention to return. One <b>spouse</b> may also lock out the other <b>spouse</b> from the marital residence. Constructive abandonment is the refusal of [...] "basic obligation arising from the marital contract," [...] including a cessation of sexual relations; establishing such a prior constructive abandonment may render the <b>spouse</b> who leaves, or locks out the other, as the innocent <b>spouse.</b>|$|R

5|$|Civil partnerships, {{introduced}} by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar, but not equal to, those of civil marriage. The ability {{to enter into a}} civil partnership ended on 16 November 2015. Constitutional protections granted to <b>spouses,</b> such as the spouse of a witness not being compelled to give evidence against their spouse in most cases, is one example of protections granted under civil partnerships. <b>Spouses</b> may further claim privilege in so far as necessary to protect the constitutional right to marital privacy. No such constitutional protections exist for civil partnerships. Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration and other types of Irish law exist. The legislation provides rights for participants in long-term cohabiting relationships (opposite- or same-sex) who have not entered into a civil partnership or marriage. The following entry focuses primarily on the same-sex civil partnership aspect of the Act, as opposed to the cohabitation aspect.|$|E
5|$|Eleven of the Shunzhi Emperor's 32 <b>spouses</b> bore him a {{total of}} {{fourteen}} children, but only four sons (Fuquan, Xuanye, Changning, and Longxi) and one daughter (Princess Gongyi Chang) lived to be old enough to marry. Unlike later Qing emperors, {{the names of the}} Shunzhi Emperor's sons did not include a generational character.|$|E
5|$|In December 1283 in Gniezno, {{at the age}} of 22 or 23 years, Ludgarda, wife of Przemysł II, died unexpectedly. Relations {{between the}} <b>spouses</b> for some time before her death weren't very good; perhaps there had even been a {{separation}} between them. The reason for this was the supposed infertility of Ludgarda, more apparent after ten years of marriage. The actual period of marital intercourse between the <b>spouses</b> given their age (both are quite young {{at the time of their}} wedding) could actually be shorter. Indeed, there is no direct proof about Ludgarda's barrenness beyond the lack of offspring; in those, the childlessness in marriage was usually considered to be the woman's fault, although in this case (due to the birth of a daughter from Przemysł II's second marriage), it seems more likely. It wasn't a surprise when accusations began to emerge against the Duke of Greater Poland of the suspected murder of his wife. It must be noted, however, that no contemporary source mentions this, a fact more surprising because Przemysł II had bitter enemies who certainly would use this crime against him. Also any reactions from church or public penance would noticed.|$|E
50|$|After a posthumous {{marriage}} the living <b>spouse</b> inherently becomes a widow or widower. Posthumous marriage will also bring the surviving <b>spouse</b> {{into the family}} of the deceased <b>spouse,</b> which can create an alliance or moral satisfaction. The surviving <b>spouse</b> is also subject to impediments of marriage that result.|$|R

40|$|Scholars {{have argued}} that the {{adjustment}} of the expatriate's <b>spouse</b> {{is an important factor in}} the success or failure of expatriates in overseas assignments; however, they have not empirically examined which factors are related to <b>spouse</b> adjustment. This study is the first to systematically examine the antecedents of <b>spouse</b> cross-cultural adjustment to interacting with host country nationals and to coping with the general, foreign environment. The results indicate that firms seeking the <b>spouse's</b> opinion about the international assignment, the <b>spouse's</b> self-initiated predeparture training, and social support from family and host country nationals during the overseas assignment have a positive relationship with <b>spouse</b> interaction adjustment. Additionally, firms' seeking the <b>spouse's</b> opinion about the international assignment and standard of living have a positive relationship with <b>spouse</b> general adjustment, while firm-provided training and culture novelty have negative relationships with <b>spouse</b> general adjustment. Several important research and practical implications are explored. © 1991 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1991) 22, 461 – 477...|$|R
5|$|In his 1931 {{treatise}} On the Nightmare, Welsh psychoanalyst Ernest Jones {{asserted that}} vampires are symbolic of several unconscious drives and defence mechanisms. Emotions such as love, guilt, and hate fuel {{the idea of}} the return of the dead to the grave. Desiring a reunion with loved ones, mourners may project the idea that the recently dead must in return yearn the same. From this arises the belief that folkloric vampires and revenants visit relatives, particularly their <b>spouses,</b> first.|$|E

She had a political discourse with National Review writer David Frum and their <b>spouses</b> arranged by Christopher Hitchens.|$|E
50|$|A {{married couple}} is not {{required}} to file jointly. If one lived apart from one's <b>spouse</b> for the last six months of the year, one may also qualify for head of household status. If a <b>spouse</b> dies during the year, the surviving <b>spouse</b> may generally still file a joint return with the deceased <b>spouse</b> for that year because the taxpayer's marital status {{at the time of the}} <b>spouse's</b> death applies to the entire taxable year.|$|R

5|$|The {{church does}} not {{recognise}} divorce as ending a valid marriage and allows state-recognised divorce {{only as a}} means of protecting the property and well being of the <b>spouses</b> and any children. However, consideration of particular cases by the competent ecclesiastical tribunal can lead to declaration of the invalidity of a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an annulment. Remarriage following a divorce is not permitted unless the prior marriage was declared invalid.|$|E
