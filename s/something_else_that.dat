It would have been a sellout in Charlotte, and they decided to do <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> <b>That</b> has caused us to pause a little bit and think through the whole relationship."

On 12 July 2017, Lipa thanked her fans for the visual's popularity, and recommended {{them to use}} the hashtag #DUASNEWRULES when uploading covers of the track in order to include them on a compilation video. The next day, Filmmaker Jake Wilson uploaded a gay parody of the music video using the hashtag, which drew the attention of some blogs and the artist herself. On 4 August 2017, the singer released the compilation video of covers and parodies of the song and the visual on her YouTube account.

500|$|Locke {{knocking}} Boone out [...] "marked a huge turning point" [...] in {{the development}} of his character. According to the writers, there was huge debate over whether Locke was good or bad; his decision {{was meant to be a}} shocking moment for viewers, since they thought people would view it as a sign that Locke was turning bad. This was characteristic of the series– the writers liked to depict a character in a certain way so that one's opinion would be made up, then they would reveal <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>that</b> would change one's mind. Locke's scene with Sayid was introduced late into production, because the episode was running short and Locke did not have scenes without Boone; Sayid's scene with Jack was also added later. Many future plot points are introduced into the episode, such as Sayid observing a magnetical anomaly, main characters crossing paths (Sawyer is being arrested in the police station where Boone is filing a complaint) and Michael's box of drawings, which sets up the following episode, [...] "Special".|$|E
500|$|Fralic also {{described}} the character as being [...] "quixotic", who is [...] "deeply layered with arrogance and angst, imbued {{with all the}} failings and bravado that a true villain possesses, his dastardly deeds leaving him most recently responsible {{not only for the}} death of his own heart donor, but for the near-death of his granddaughter Summer from peanut poisoning". She also noted that he's been jailed, thrown in a psychiatric ward and shot, had amnesia, epilepsy among other events, but [...] "like all villains worth their salt, he's survived it all and inspired respect, if not adoration". Braeden describes the character as [...] "the villain" [...] and as [...] "defensive and always self-protective", stating that he's [...] "not here to win a popularity contest". He stated that he enjoys portraying Victor [...] "more than anything", also describing him as [...] "very complex". Braeden said that [...] "he fought himself to the position he arrived at a number of years ago", and that [...] "he obviously doesn't suffer fools easily, doesn't suffer enemies easily. He wants relationships badly, but doesn't quite trust them. It's a tragic flaw in him because of his childhood." [...] The actor, comparing himself to the character, noted that he is nothing like Victor, stating: [...] "Money makes a lot of things happen for Victor. My God almighty, that's <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>that</b> I, Eric Braeden, would never do. I always confront things directly. But when that doesn't work for Victor, he gets out his wallet [...] If you are abusive to him, he will be abusive to you. No one gets away with that. I will not allow anyone to cross that line with the character." ...|$|E

The name was inspired by the movie The Octagon starring Chuck Norris. Together they created the concept of [...] "Octagón", a Mexican Ninja complete with black clothes and a black and white mask that incorporated a red headband. The Octagón gimmick also played off previous Karate gimmicks in Lucha Libre such as Kung Fu and Kato Kung Lee. The Octagón persona was a hit with the fans, especially the younger fans earning Octagón the nickname [...] "El ídolo de Los niños" [...] (Spanish for the idol of the kids). Octagón became very involved in charities that benefited children, <b>something</b> <b>else</b> <b>that</b> helped make him popular with the younger fans.
