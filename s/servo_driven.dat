The hydraulic dampers at the front had their damping rate controlled by governor and so varied {{with the speed of}} the car, making it superior to its predecessor, the 25/30 H.P. and on par with the Phantom III. The car was still built on a separate chassis but this was now of welded rather than the traditional riveted construction. The drum brakes were assisted by a mechanical <b>servo</b> <b>driven</b> by the engine patented by Hispano-Suiza and built by Rolls-Royce under licence.

40|$|Near-to-reality {{endurance}} {{testing of}} bikes An innovative test setup for complete bikes has been built. It {{consists of a}} three main parts: -	a <b>servo</b> <b>driven</b> drum -	a <b>servo</b> <b>driven</b> brake actuator -	a set of two <b>servo</b> <b>driven</b> “legs” Any type of bike can be tested without modification, just by using a cantilever arm to push the rear wheel of the bike on the drum. The drum is used to drive the rear wheel of the bike and simulate inertia forces, slope of the track, rolling resistance and air resistance. Internal resistance to acceleration of the drum is compensated. Since the drum is <b>servo</b> <b>driven,</b> any net torque {{as a function of}} speed can be applied. The forces applied by the cyclist are reproduced by the <b>servo</b> <b>driven</b> legs and can be alternated with braking forces on the rear wheel. The setup has initially been designed to perform endurance tests on mounted brake systems. The brake lever is pulled and controlled in order to cause a specific deceleration of the bike. After release of the lever the bike is accelerated by the drum and brakes are cooled based on scanned temperature values. The braking cycle is then repeated. For any brake system the number of “cycles to adjustment” and the number of “cycles to failure” can be measured according to the international standard Eumos 40701 - 1. In a second faze the test setup was extended to allow for endurance tests on the driving train of a bike. Each pedal is driven by an independent servo controlled leg. The forces on the pedals can vary {{as a function of the}} position of the pedal and can depend on the actual speed. The drum is used to generate the real life resistance forces. The test is applicable for any type of derailleur system as well as for e-bikes using a rear wheel drive or a crank motor. Right from the first tests it is observed that the frame of a bike is crucial for both types of tests. Forces on pedals do cause global deformation of the bike frame especially during “in the saddle” biking. Real life pedal forces can be measured easily using commer¬cially available sensors. Measured forces are categorized according to conventional theory for accelerated endurance testing. Categorized forces are applied on the pedals. They can be inter¬rupted by simulating an emergency brake if relevant. Unintentionally some poor quality metal frames failed completely. For composite frames an increase in deformation is observed. Therefore it is concluded that this test setup is very suitable for near-to-reality testing of complete bikes. Apparently it is very promising to quantify relevant bike stiffness parameters and their decrease during bicycle life time. However further improvements of the current setup are recommended, e. g. introduction of reaction forces on the steering bar could be important to improve the correlation between lab tests and reality. Ultimately it is expected that the remaining safe life time of a bike will be predictable using the test setup as described. status: submitte...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, an {{intelligent}} robust position controller for permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) <b>servo</b> <b>drives</b> is proposed. The intelligent robust position controller {{consists of a}} two-degrees-of-freedom integral plus proportional & rate feedback (2 DOF I-PD) controller {{in addition to an}} on-line trained neural-network model-following controller (NNMFC). This controller, 2 DOF I-PD NNMFC, combines the merits of the 2 DOF I-PD controller and the NNMF controller for PMSM <b>servo</b> <b>drives</b> position control. A systematic mathematical procedure is derived to find the parameters of the 2 DOF I-PD position controller according to the required specifications for the PMSM <b>servo</b> <b>drive</b> system. Then, the resulting closed loop transfer function of the <b>servo</b> <b>drive</b> system including the current control, speed control and position control loops is used as the reference model. In addition to the 2 DOF I-PD position controller, a neural-network model-following controller whose weights are trained on-line is designed to realize high dynamic performance in disturbance rejection and tracking characteristics. According to the model-following error between the outputs of the reference model and the PMSM <b>servo</b> <b>drive</b> system, the NNMFC generates two adaptive control signal which are added to the 2 DOF I-PD speed controller output to attain robust model-following characteristics under different operating conditions regardless of parameter variations and load disturbances. A computer simulation is developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 2 DOF I-PD NNMF position controller. The results confirm that the proposed 2 DOF I-PD NNMF position controller produces robust performance, rapid and accurate response to the reference model regardless of load disturbances or PMSM parameter variations...|$|R
