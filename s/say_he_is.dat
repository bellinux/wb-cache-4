25|$|On 9 May 2009, Kadyrov claimed Umarov {{had been}} {{reportedly}} severely wounded and that {{four of his}} bodyguards were killed in an operation commanded by Kadyrov's cousin and deputy, Adam Delimkhanov. Early rumors claimed Umarov had been killed, and in June the Russian authorities forensically examined the four burned corpses {{to see whether they}} included that of Umarov. The next month, however, Umarov himself phoned the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> alive; and in an interview conducted in July 2009 with Prague Watchdog Umarov claimed that {{the last time he had}} been wounded was in 1995 during the First Chechen War. On 19 January 2010, Kadyrov announced that he had launched another Delimkhanov-led special operation in Chechnya’s mountains to find and eliminate Umarov. Umarov's possible death was reported once again in March 2011, when Russian government said an air strike and special forces raid on a rebel base in Ingushetia killed 17 Chechen and Ingush militants including his deputy Supyan Abdullayev, but Umarov's body was not found there too.|$|E

In a phone interview with Breitbart News on July 19, 2013, Paul said, [...] "I basically <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> bailing them out over my dead body, because we don't have any money in Washington." [...] Paul said he thought a federal bailout would send {{the wrong message to}} other cities with financial problems.|$|E
500|$|After Charles's death, Lucinda Dalton {{applied to}} cancel her temple sealing to Charles in 1884: [...] "though I {{know he had}} many imperfections... now the brethren <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> unworthy, (though I know not who {{appointed}} them to judge him,) they urge that I stand in a very insecure position, and that for my children's sake, {{as well as my}} own, I ought to marry again." [...] Dalton feared that by remaining sealed to Charles, she would forfeit her claim to her children. Perhaps because Charles was a drinker, her [...] "brethren" [...] considered him unworthy of his sealing. Her sealing cancellation was approved in 1887 and then revoked after her death in 1931.|$|E
500|$|Despite his reluctance, Scheider {{pledged to}} do the best job that he could, wanting to make Brody believable. However, the {{atmosphere}} was tense on the set, and he often argued with Szwarc. On one occasion, Scheider complained (in front of extras) that Szwarc was wasting time with technical issues and the extras while ignoring the principal actors. A meeting was called with the two, David Brown and Verna Fields, in which Scheider and Szwarc were encouraged to settle their differences. The discussion became heated and a physical fight broke out, which Brown and Fields broke up. The rift was also articulated in written correspondence. In a letter to Szwarc, Scheider wrote that [...] "working with Jeannot Szwarc is knowing he will never <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> sorry or ever admitting he overlooked something. Well, enough of that shit for me!" [...] He requested an apology from the director for not consulting him. Szwarc's reply focused upon completing the film to the [...] "best possible" [...] standard: ...|$|E

500|$|For {{politically}} motivated reasons, the Soviet Union presented various versions of Hitler's fate. In {{the years immediately}} following 1945, the Soviets maintained Hitler was not dead, but had fled and was being shielded by the former western allies. This worked for a time to create doubt among western authorities. The chief of the U.S. trial counsel at Nuremberg, Thomas J. Dodd, said: [...] "No one can <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> dead." [...] When President Harry S. Truman asked Stalin at the Potsdam Conference in August 1945 whether or not Hitler was dead, Stalin replied bluntly, [...] "No". But by 11 May 1945, the Soviets had already confirmed through Hitler's dentist, Hugo Blaschke, dental assistant Käthe Heusermann and dental technician Fritz Echtmann that the dental remains found were Hitler's and Braun's. In November 1945, Dick White, then head of counter-intelligence in the British sector of Berlin (and later head of MI5 and MI6 in succession), had their agent Hugh Trevor-Roper investigate the matter to counter the Soviet claims. His findings were written in a report and published in book form in 1947.|$|E
500|$|Presley {{undertook}} three brief tours {{during the}} year, continuing {{to generate a}} crazed audience response. A Detroit newspaper suggested that [...] "the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed." [...] Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver, the crowd rioted {{after the end of}} the show, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenaged girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as [...] "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious.... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons.... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore." [...] Asked for a response, Presley said, [...] "I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to <b>say.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it.... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|After Mitchell {{declared}} for the 2001 NFL Draft, one NFL scout {{told the}} Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel in February, [...] "I don't think he's {{as fast as}} people in the press try to <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> He's absolutely fearless over the middle but he prefers to trap the ball instead of to extend for it. I don't think he has nearly the explosion {{to be considered a}} first." [...] Mitchell was also criticized by scouts for his small frame and potential character issues. Draft analyst Mel Kiper, Jr. rated Mitchell as the 16th-best prospect in the draft following the NFL Scouting Combine in which he ran a 4.4-second 40-yard dash, and called him a player on the rise. Kiper also rated him as the fifth-best wide receiver in the draft and projected Mitchell to be drafted in the mid-first round following his performance at the Combine. In rating players several times leading up to the draft, Kiper re-watched game film of each player and adjusted their rankings accordingly. In his March 5 mock draft, Kiper projected Mitchell to be drafted by the Green Bay Packers with the tenth overall selection. He ranked Mitchell as the 18th-best player in the draft on March 30. NFLDraftScout.com projected Mitchell to be drafted in the second round and rated him as the eighth-best wide receiver in the draft. Kiper ranked him the fourth-best wide receiver in the draft on April 2. In his April 10 mock draft, Kiper projected Mitchell to be drafted by the Denver Broncos with the 24th overall selection. Ed Bouchette of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ranked Mitchell as the sixth-best wide receiver in the draft. Mitchell hired Tom Condon of IMG Football as his agent leading up to the draft.|$|E

500|$|On September 11, Matthew Woll, an AFL vice-president, {{said his}} {{organization}} discouraged strikes by government employees but defended {{their right to}} organize: [...] "all wage earners {{have the right to}} associate with one another and collectively to improve their condition". He blamed the strike on government managers who failed to recognize that right and put the Boston situation {{in the context of the}} broader union movement: [...] "On the question of industrial democracy , we find still that group of employers, Bourbonic in character, who believe democracy means for them to ruin or rule industrially. They cannot conceive that the workers have any right in the management of industry. ... The time has passed when any man can <b>say</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the ruler of the people in his employment." [...] AFL President Samuel Gompers, just returned from Europe, quickly assessed the situation and the strength of public sentiment. On September 12, he urged the strikers to return to work, asking the city to agree to suspend judgment on whether to recognize the police union. In a telegram to Mayor Peters he cited the model of Washington, D.C., which had, at the suggestion of President Wilson, suspended its regulation forbidding police officers to join a union affiliated with the AFL until a conference scheduled for October 6. The police accepted Gompers' recommendation immediately. Coolidge replied with a statement of support for Curtis' hard line. Gompers telegraphed Coolidge again, this time blaming Curtis for the crisis. Coolidge dismissed the Commissioner's behavior as irrelevant, because no provocation could justify the police walkout. His terse summation created his reputation on the national scene: [...] "There is no right to strike against the public safety, anywhere, anytime." [...] Coolidge said he would continue to [...] "defend the sovereignty of Massachusetts." ...|$|E
