On the other hand, the government maintains that the Tibetan Government did almost nothing to improve the Tibetans' material standard of life during its rule from 1913–59, and that they opposed any reforms proposed by the Chinese government. According to the Chinese government, {{this is the reason}} for the tension that grew between some central government officials and the local Tibetan government in 1959. The claims of economic hardship under the Dalai Lama's government from 191359 are disputed by the 10th Panchen Lama in the 70,000 Character Petition; however, the Panchen Lama praised the 1980s reform and opening up under Deng Xiaoping.|$|E

The effect of financial and non-financial performance of organizations on e-business <b>strategy</b> <b>planning</b> is investigated. The relationships between the four strategic planning parameters are examined, the directions of these relationships are given and six additional basic components are also considered. The new conceptual model has been constructed for e-business strategic planning and performance evaluation and an adaptive algorithmic modelling approach is presented. The new adaptive algorithmic modelling scheme including eleven dynamic modules, can be optimized and used effectively in e-business strategic planning and strategic planning evaluation of various e-services in very large organizations and businesses. A synoptic statistical analysis and comparative numerical results for the case of UK and Greece are given. The proposed e-business models indicate how e-business strategic planning may affect financial and non-financial performance in business and organizations by exploring whether models which are used for <b>strategy</b> <b>planning</b> {{can be applied to}} e-business planning and whether these models would be valid in different environments. A conceptual model has been constructed and qualitative research methods have been used for testing a predetermined number of considered hypotheses. The proposed models have been tested in the UK and Greece and the conclusions including numerical results and statistical analyses indicated existing relationships between considered dependent and independent variables. The proposed e-business models are expected to contribute to e-business <b>strategy</b> <b>planning</b> of businesses and organizations and managers should consider applying these models to their e-business <b>strategy</b> <b>planning</b> to improve their companies’ performances. This research study brings together elements of e-business <b>strategy</b> <b>planning,</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>planning</b> and performance management.

40|$|CRM is a {{relative}} new technology in which allows organisations to capture data, and improve customer service capabilities. IT <b>strategy</b> <b>planning</b> {{is the process of}} planning, and implementing changes, to ensure organisations have best practise in regards to decision making and infrastructure. At the current moment there is little information domestically available in Australia about CRM systems. This thesis provides some insight, in-regards to CRM and IT <b>strategy</b> <b>planning</b> practice, in Australia. CRM implementation and development, is difficult and complicated. IT <b>strategy</b> <b>planning</b> is a difficult task which requires good sources of information. Many organisations have developed large bodies of information about their business, based on their CRM systems. This thesis, uses a survey of 51 organisations to examine the organisation&rsquo;s use of CRM systems, and their use of IT <b>strategy</b> <b>planning,</b> and the relationship between CRM and IT <b>strategy</b> <b>planning.</b> The results of the survey found, that CRM is used in conjunction with IT <b>strategy</b> <b>planning</b> for customer profiling, customer forecasting, cost reduction mechanism, and shared or distributed customer data. In summary this means that firms looking to implement a CRM system, are doing so as means to support and enhance business operations, in terms of development and functionality. The main recommendations of what is discovered in this thesis are: &bull; Used to improve customer relationships between an organisation and customers/clients &bull; Used to develop new products to the marketplace &bull; To reduce costs in an organisation &bull; To streamline and improve business process in an organisatio...|$|R
