5|$|Abbotsford Bridge is a steel Allan truss-type bridge {{spanning}} the Murray River between Curlwaa, New South Wales, and Yelta, Victoria. It {{is the only}} remaining <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> bridge with a lift span that crosses the Murray. Opened in 1928, the bridge was built by the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Public Works and was designed by Percy Allan. It was the second last lift-span bridge to be built over the river, the last being the Nyah Bridge, which opened in 1941.|$|E
5|$|At {{the south}} eastern {{corner of the}} eastern terrace is the former pumping station, {{associated}} tunnels {{and a set of}} 1850s workshops within an enclosing wall. Underneath parts of the eastern terrace, the adjacent Hampton Road, the pumping station and the workshops there are a complex series of shafts, drives and weirs cut from the rock during the 1890s and early twentieth century. The east workshops is a single storey limestone building on the western side with an enclosed area to the east. The entire workshops yard was roofed using a light <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> on steel supports in 1960.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, Turner Construction {{was awarded}} the $105 million {{construction}} contract to build and finish Capitol Hill station's interior and entrances. Turner began interior construction in March 2013, using an unusual <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> support system to pour concrete for station elements. Construction on the west entrance and its {{cut and cover tunnel}} under Broadway began in November 2013 and required lane shifts on Broadway throughout 2014. By the summer of 2015, work on Capitol Hill station was declared 90 percent complete, and the construction wall was gradually removed.|$|E

5000|$|The Florenceville Bridge is {{a wooden}} covered bridge {{combined}} with a <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> which crosses the Saint John River at Florenceville, New Brunswick, Canada. Built in 1907, the 46.9 metre (154 foot) bridge has one wooden Howe <b>truss</b> span, four <b>steel</b> through <b>trusses</b> and one plate girder span. [...] The bridge evolved from a five span uncovered Burr Truss bridge built in 1885. One Burr span was converted to a covered Howe truss and in 1907 the others were converted to <b>steel</b> <b>trusses.</b>|$|R

5|$|Other bridges {{have also}} been built over Little Fishing Creek. A <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> bridge was built over it in 1896. A bridge {{carrying}} Pennsylvania Route 254 over the creek was built in 1930 and a bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 42 over the creek was built in 1939, as was one other bridge. Five other bridges {{were built in the}} 1940s and 1950s, including another bridge built in 1955 and carrying Pennsylvania Route 42. Several more bridges were built in the 1960s. The newest bridges over the creek were constructed in 1974, 1990, and 2009.|$|E
5|$|The I-35W Mississippi River bridge (officially {{known as}} Bridge 9340) was an eight-lane, <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> arch bridge that carried Interstate 35W across the Saint Anthony Falls of the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. During the evening rush hour on August 1, 2007, it {{suddenly}} collapsed, killing 13 people and injuring 145. The bridge was Minnesota's third busiest, carrying 140,000 vehicles daily. The NTSB cited a design flaw as the likely {{cause of the}} collapse, noting that a too-thin gusset plate ripped along a line of rivets, and asserted that additional weight on the bridge {{at the time of}} the collapse contributed to the catastrophic failure.|$|E
5|$|To {{continue}} economic {{use of the}} river, {{civic leaders}} pushed for plans to build locks and dams, making the Mississippi River navigable above Saint Anthony Falls for the first time. Congressional approval for the Upper Minneapolis Harbor Development Project came in 1937 but it wasn't until 1950 through 1963, that the United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed two sets of locks at the lower dam and at the falls. They also covered the falls with a permanent concrete apron. The project also resulted in the disfiguration of the Stone Arch Bridge by replacing two of the arches with a <b>steel</b> <b>truss.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Architecturally, the {{load-bearing}} masonry {{building in}} the Renaissance Revival style is significant for its early efforts to introduce <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> into traditional masonry-bearing wall and heavy timber construction. It has also been noted as an outstanding early example {{of the work of}} architects Frank H. and Joseph G. Cunningham. [...] The building illustrates the early use of <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> to provide a clear-span auditorium with 18-foot ceilings. [...] At the time of construction, use of <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> was still in the experimental phase. The design of the building is an early example of “the gradual replacement of load-bearing masonry and heavy timber structures with steel frame construction.” [...] The building has 86 tall windows with segmental arches, laid out like those in many textile mills in the region.|$|R

5|$|MD291 {{begins in}} the town of Chestertown at a {{roundabout}} with MD20 (Chestertown Road) near the eastern terminus of the latter highway, which continues south as High Street toward downtown Chestertown. MD291 heads east as two-lane Morgnec Road, which intersects the Gilchrest Rail Trail and passes along the northern edge of Washington College. The highway intersects MD213 (Washington Avenue) at Lees Corner and leaves the town limits shortly before passing the Maryland State Highway Administration District 2 offices. MD291 crosses Morgan Creek on a <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> bridge on its way to Morgnec, where the highway's name changes to River Road at its intersection with Morgnec Road, which heads north and then east further from the Chester River than MD291. The state highway crosses Goosehaven Creek and Norris Creek and meets the eastern end of MD298 (Cherry Lane).|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} {{completed}} in 1928 by the NSW Department of Public Works and, although opened as a traffic bridge, {{it was designed to}} carry the loads required for a railway, once the Mildura railway line had been extended over the bridge. The line was never extended beyond Yelta, where the terminus remains to this day. The location of the bridge was thought to be convenient, as it provided a link to the Sturt Highway without travelling farther upstream to Mildura. It is the only remaining <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> bridge with a lift span on the Murray, although other lifting bridges still exist along the river. The bridge was built after the decline in commercial river traffic on the Murray. Due to its significance to the local area, it has been listed on the NSW State Heritage Register.|$|E
25|$|The bridges in Fulton County exhibit {{two types}} of <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> bridge construction, Pratt bridge and Parker, which were the most common early types of <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> bridges. Due to {{variation}} within each type of bridge, the collection in Fulton County offered {{a unique opportunity to}} view the evolution of late 19th and early 20th century <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> bridge construction. For example, the now-demolished London Mills Bridge, a Pratt built in 1883, features pinned connection and double eyebars for the lower chord and for the diagonals. This is compared to the also destroyed Indian Ford Bridge, a Pratt bridge built in 1917, which used riveted connections and I-beam construction for its lower chords and diagonals.|$|E

25|$|Together, {{the nine}} <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> bridges stood {{out because of}} their {{proximity}} to each other within Fulton County. Indeed, they also held historical significance for their age and as examples of early <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> bridge construction; but it is rare to find such a concentrated collection of so clearly related sites. When they were nominated for the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, before some were destroyed, they were the subject of local tours by canoe and road.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Randall K. and Martha A. Hunter Amphitheater Description== The amphitheater has architecturally exposed <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> and frames {{supporting}} curved steel roof purlins {{with a heavy}} timber, tongue-and-groove roof deck. The <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> and {{frames are}} designed and shaped to resemble the fronds of a palm tree. The steel structure is supported on concrete piers that are supported on a large concrete pile cap that rests on auger-cast-in-place piles. The concrete piers also support the main stage floor. The stage floor is a flat plate, 8 in thick post-tensioned concrete slab.|$|R
5000|$|The precast {{concrete}} double-wall panel {{has been in}} use in Europe for decades. The original double-wall design consisted of two wythes of reinforced concrete separated by an interior void, held together with embedded <b>steel</b> <b>trusses.</b> With recent concerns about energy use, it is recognized that using <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> creates a [...] "thermal bridge" [...] that degrades thermal performance. Also, since steel {{does not have the}} same thermal expansion coefficient as concrete, as the wall heats and cools any steel that is not embedded in the concrete can create thermal stresses that cause cracking and spalling.|$|R

25|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>truss</b> {{cantilevers}} support loads by {{tension of}} the upper members and compression of the lower ones. Commonly, the structure distributes the tension via the anchor arms to the outermost supports, while the compression is carried to the foundations beneath the central towers. Many truss cantilever bridges use pinned joints and are therefore statically determinate with no members carrying mixed loads.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} simple {{methods of}} analysis for preliminary design of high-rise structures comprising reinforced concrete shear walls or <b>steel</b> <b>trussed</b> frames with a perimeter belt bracing structure consisting of <b>steel</b> <b>trusses,</b> subjected to horizontal loading. The methods {{are based on the}} analysis of facade rigger braced structures where horizontal <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> (web riggers), located in the two end facades (web frames), are positioned in a direction parallel to the lateral loading on the building. Perpendicular to the horizontal load additional horizontal <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> in the wind and lee sides of the building, 2 ̆ 2 flange trusses 2 ̆ 2, complete the belt bracing structure. The method is focused on the contribution of the flange trusses to the lateral stiffness of the structure. The shear-lag due to differential strain in the flange frame columns along the wind and leeward facades is caused by bending and racking shear deformations in the flange trusses and is taken into account. In an approximate method the flange columns are replaced by a continuous medium of equivalent axial stiffness, i. e. a beam on an elastic foundation. The proposed {{methods of analysis}}, for use in the initial stages of the structural design of proposed tall buildings, offer simple and rapid means of establishing the influence of belt structures on horizontal deformations of the high-rise structure and internal forces...|$|R
25|$|A {{cantilever}} bridge is a bridge built using cantilevers, structures that project horizontally into space, supported {{on only one}} end. For small footbridges, the cantilevers may be simple beams; however, large {{cantilever bridge}}s designed to handle road or rail traffic use trusses built from structural steel, or box girders built from prestressed concrete. The <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when first put into practice, as it can span distances of over , and can be more easily constructed at difficult crossings by virtue of using little or no falsework.|$|E
