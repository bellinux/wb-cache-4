50|$|On March 16, 2011, {{a privately}} owned Beechcraft King Air crashed shortly after takeoff, killing five people and {{injuring}} another. The NTSB determined {{the cause of}} the crash to be a result of poor pilot technique that failed to maintain aircraft control, following a momentary interruption of power to the left engine caused by water contamination of the fuel. The NTSB found the water contamination was allowed to build up in the aircraft's <b>fuel</b> <b>sumps</b> due to poor maintenance and pre-flight practices, and lack of communication between the pilot and aircraft mechanics over who was responsible for draining the sumps before each flight. Because of this, enough water was allowed to build up in the <b>fuel</b> <b>sumps</b> to initiate this accident.|$|R
5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of damage to the A-10's fuel system, all four fuel tanks are located near the aircraft's center and are separated from the fuselage; projectiles would need to penetrate the aircraft's skin before reaching a tank's outer skin. Compromised fuel transfer lines self-seal; if damage exceeds a tank's self-sealing capabilities, check valves prevent fuel flowing into a compromised tank. Most fuel system components are inside the tanks so that fuel will not be lost due to component failure. The refueling system is also purged after use. Reticulated polyurethane foam lines both the inner and outer sides of the fuel tanks, retaining debris and restricting fuel spillage in the event of damage. The engines are shielded {{from the rest of the}} airframe by firewalls and fire extinguishing equipment. In the event of all four main tanks being lost, two self-sealing <b>sump</b> tanks contain <b>fuel</b> for 230miles (370km) of flight.|$|R
50|$|Built by the Ford Motorsport (Ford TeamRS) {{works at}} Boreham, Essex, The Rally Ka was {{designed}} as an entry-level vehicle {{to compete in a}} one-make series as part of the British Mintex rally championship. The Ka Championship in 1997 with just four cars in the debut Granite City Rally event. In 1998 fifteen competitors undertook the Mintex challenge. Ford's Boreham airfield facility provides a complete build service for competitors wishing to rally Ka. Most of the parts supplied are concerned with strengthening the car for rallying. Uprated engine mounts and suspension bushes are all included, as is a front strut brace. Aluminium <b>sump</b> and <b>fuel</b> tank guards, OZ Rally wheels and a Safety Devices bolt-in roll cage are all either fitted by the Boreham works or supplied to individual teams. Performance-enhancing modifications are limited to the addition of a Rally spec engine control unit, camshaft and 4-into-2-into-1 extractor set attached to a free-flowing exhaust. This combination lifts power to , and to cope with it competitors are encouraged to fit the optional uprated drive shafts with larger CV joints. A limited-slip differential and heavier clutch plate are also available. A competition brake package consisting of Mintex pads gripping vented front brake rotors and stronger rear drums is homologated for Rally Ka. Replacing the original shock absorbers is a set of four remote-reservoir Proflex coil-over struts adjustable for compression and rebound damping. These are allied to a lowering kit and adjustable spring platforms to give Ka competitors a wide range of suspension settings including ride height. Inside the Rally Ka is all business. In true rally fashion gone are all but the essentials: the two central eyeball vents are replaced by a tachometer and auxiliary gauge. Even the replacement panels in the dashboard which support the fire extinguisher button and extra switches and gauges required in a rally car are listed in the Boreham parts schedule. A deeply dished rally steering wheel, competition seats and harnesses are all supplied from the kit and replacements are not allowed.|$|R

Explain how the proposed criterion is suitable for the fuel design that is currently {{the basis for the}} ABWR design. RESPONSE: The analysis that was reviewed by the NRC staff on July 12, 2010, which evaluates the effects of debris downstream of the ECCS <b>sump</b> strainers on <b>fuel</b> coolability, is also applicable to the GE- 7 fuel used in the ABWR DCD. The reason the calculations also apply to GE- 7 fuel is that the differences between the GE- 7 and Optima 2 fuel designs are not significant for purposes of these calculations. The calculations determine the maximum flow restriction to the hot channel that will maintain a two-phase flow through the channel and not cause any significant fuel heat up (Vapor Void Fraction 0. 95).

5000|$|Norton-Villiers {{developed}} the P11 from the Norton Atlas as an export {{model for the}} growing sport of desert racing. Prototyped by Californian Norton Distributor Bob Blair using the Atlas 750cc twin cylinder engine in a Matchless G85 CS (Competition Scrambles) Reynolds 531 lightweight steel frame. Blair might have been responding to requests from the importer, Joseph Berliner of Berliner Motor Corporation. The aim was to achieve the best possible power-to-weight ratio, so all the cycle parts were made as light as possible, with a small alloy fuel tank. The magneto and Monobloc carburettors on the prototype were replaced with twin coil capacitor ignition and twin Amal Concentric carburettors, {{as well as a}} speedometer and tachometer and an alloy <b>sump</b> guard. The <b>fuel</b> tank and alloy oil tank were painted in Candy Apple Red with the frame in black. The new motorcycle was known as Project 11, and although testers of the prototype suggested that it should be called the Cheetah 45, it was eventually shortened to P11 and built at the former Associated Motor Cycles factory in Woolwich, London, largely from spare parts. The first P11 (No. 121007) was completed in March 1967 and the first batch were exported to the US and launched under the advertising slogan [...] "Dynamite on wheels". They sold well with demand outstripping supply.|$|R
5000|$|Stagger-EZ is {{a unique}} three place pusher canard aircraft, {{featuring}} staggered seating, a dihedral canard, and a rounder fuselage which differs from other canard aircraft in its class (e.g. Cozy MK IV, Velocity, Long-Ez). The aircraft has standard LongEZ wings and a redesigned fuselage. It was designed by a composite craftsman and pilot {{by the name of}} Steve Wright. After completing a VariEZe, Steve Wright found it to be a good design but small and lacking in features he wanted. He flew over a thousand hours in his VariEZe but wanted to build a second canard. He learned that a couple of pilots had suffered broken legs in Long-EZ accidents. So Steve began his design of a new canard that would incorporate several improvements. In 1999 he started by laying a keel {{down the center of the}} composite fuselage, which in turn caused the nose wheel to be moved to the right several inches. That improved legroom for the PIC position on the left. The reduced area on the right floor board did not allow for dual rudder pedals. The rods that control the elevator and aileron where positioned in a center console rather than down each side like a Cozy III. The right seater stick is 13 inches behind the left seater. Thus the right seat is [...] "Staggered" [...] back 13 inches. Lastly, a third seat is in the back behind the left seat. With a 42 inch wide fuselage, Steve ordered a custom canopy be made that is at least 20% larger than a Cozy III. The canopy does not open to the side, but is electric and moves up and back like many jet aircraft. Another major change was made to the landing gear. It was moved out and anchored in the strake area. (Any rocks or debris kicked up by the main landing gear are outside of the propeller arc.) Steve also incorporated a simpler fuel system. A central <b>sump</b> connects both <b>fuel</b> tanks. So the Stagger EZ has only one fuel cap but still holds 43 gallons. The Stagger EZ flew for the first time in 2004. Steve flew the Stagger EZ to EAA's [...] "Sun-N-Fun" [...] Fly-In and received [...] "Grand Champion" [...] in the home built category in 2005. Steve and Patricia Wright flew the Stagger EZ until 2009 when Steve came down with cancer. Steve died from melanoma cancer in May 2010. David Williford purchased the StaggerEZ in May 2011. He flew it for 50 hours before having to ground it for a major restoration which lasted almost two years. The Stagger EZ still flies today because of both Steve Wright and David Williford.

40|$|The offered {{project of}} storage {{facility}} {{allows us to}} simplify and unitise the ground-based infrastructure objects. The storage facility implements a full preparatory cycle of the propellant components (PC) in all parameters. Another problem the developers of complexes of groundbased equipment face now is bulk receipt of PC from manufacturer. The tanks of launch complexes cannot accept such volumes of propellant. It proves {{that there is a}} need to create a storage facility. The facility solves problems concerning the components receipt, temperature preparation, moisture content (drying), gas content, and supply to consumers. For preparation the perspective technologies with low power consumption are used. Receiving the propellant from the dispensing platform is carried out via filters of rough cleaning. Transfer from transport tankage goes using a pump. The received product passes through a gas separator to clean technological gas impurity. To prepare propellant temperature, a technology of cryogenic bubbling by boiling nitrogen is chosen. To improve efficiency of cryogenic bubbling it is advised to use the specialized capacities. Railway dimensions, admissible for the trainload goods across the railroads of Siberia and the Far East, define their sizes. As a drying technology and a gas content preparation the preliminary propellant filtration using vertical electro-separators is chosen to save a space. The chamber vertical electroseparators allow 2 — 3 times increase of dehydration capacity. The article presents calculations to prove that using the chosen cooling and drying technologies is efficient. Prepared PC can be supplied: • to transport-fueling containers (TFC) with the subsequent transportation to the launch complexes either by the railway or by road; • to mobile fuelling tanks, which feed rocket-carrier tanks on arrival at the blast-off; • to transport capacities for transportation to the object outside the cosmodrome (spaceport); • directly to tanks of the rocket-carriers through the pipeline. A direct supply of the prepared component to the rocket-carrier tanks allows a significantly decreasing equipment demand at the launch complex (LC) owing to almost full abandonment of the near-launch storehouses and propellant-feed systems. The pipeline fuel remnants are discharged through the branch in the <b>sump</b> from which <b>fuel</b> can be directed to the storage capacities to have its future preparation again. Existing LC versus LC with the storage facility: - Each LC has a separate near-launch storehouse; - Each near-launch storehouse contains several charges to feed fuel tanks of rocket-carrier; - Each LC has the unique systems of propellant preparation. Application of storage facility: - storage facility allows bulk receipt and storage of high-boiling propellant to meet needs of all LC of the spaceport; - there are all means at the storage facility to prepare high-boiling propellant in all required parameters; - high-boiling propellant can be supplied from the storage facility using both transport capacities, and pipelines directly to the rocket-carrier tanks. Advantages: + possibility to receive and store the bulk high-boiling propellant + decreasing total demand of technological systems + simplified spaceport infrastructure Disadvantages: - decreasing reliability rates caused by a lack of reservation of technological systems</p...|$|R
40|$|NASA {{is seeking}} to develop thermal {{insulation}} material systems suitable for withstanding both extremely high temperatures encountered during atmospheric re-entry heating and aero- braking maneuvers, as well as extremely low temperatures existing in liquid fuel storage tanks. Currently, materials used for the high temperature insulation or Thermal Protection System (TPS) {{are different from the}} low temperature, or cryogenic insulation. Dual purpose materials are necessary to the development of reusable launch vehicles (RLV). The present Space Shuttle (or Space Transportation System, STS) employs TPS materials on the orbiter and cryo-insulation materials on the large fuel tank slung under the orbiter. The expensive fuel tank is jettisoned just before orbit is achieved and it burns up while re-entering over the Indian Ocean. A truly completely reusable launch vehicle must store aR cryogenic fuel internally. The fuel tanks will be located close to the outer surface. In fact the outer skin of the craft will probably also serve as the fuel tank enclosure, as in jet airliners. During a normal launch the combined TPS/cryo-insulation system will serve only as a low temperature insulator, since aerodynamic heating is relatively minimal during ascent to orbit. During re-entry, the combined TPS/cryo-insulation system will serve only as a high temperature insulator, since all the cryogenic fuel will have been expended in orbit. However, in the event of an. aborted launch or a forced/emergency early re-entry, the tanks will still contain fuel, and the TPS/cryo-insulation will have to serve as both low and high temperature insulation. Also, on long duration missions, such as to Mars, very effective cryo-insulation materials are needed to reduce bod off of liquid propellants, thereby reducing necessary tankage volume, weight, and cost. The conventional approach to obtaining both low and high temperature insulation, such as is employed for the X- 33 and X- 34 spacecraft, is to use separate TPS and cryo-insulation materials, which are connected by means of adhesives or stand-offs (spacers). Three concepts are being considered: (1) the TPS is bonded directly to the cryo-insulation which, in turn, is bonded to the exterior of the tank, (2) stand-offs are used to make a gap between the TPS and the cryo-insulation, which is bonded externally to the tank, (3) TPS is applied directly or with stand-offs to the exterior so the tank, and cryo-insulation is applied directly to the interior of the tank. Many potential problems are inherent in these approaches. For example, mismatch between coefficients of thermal expansion of the TPS and cryo-insulation, as well as aerodynamic loads, could lead to failure of the bond. Internal cryo-insulation must be prevent from entering the <b>sump</b> of the <b>fuel</b> turbo-pump. The mechanical integrity of the stand-off structure (if used) must withstand multiple missions. During ground hold (i. e., prior to launch) moisture condensation must be minimized in the gap between the cryo-insulation and the TPS. The longer term solution requires the development of a single material to act as cryo- insulation during ground hold and as TPS during re-entry. Such a material minimizes complexity and weight while improving reliability and reducing cost...|$|R
