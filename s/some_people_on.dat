In February 1919, the Young Men's Christian Association attempted a peaceful takeover of the college, offering to raise an endowment of $500,000 if Antioch would serve as the official national college of the YMCA. The YMCA proposal was received positively by the college's trustees and enacted by a unanimous vote, and Grant Perkins, a YMCA executive, assumed the college's presidency.

This portion of treatment consists of multiple therapy sessions, which include both group and individual counseling with various chemical dependency counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and other professionals. In addition, many treatment centers utilize twelve-step facilitation techniques, embracing the 12-step programs practiced by such organizations as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> maintenance therapies have veered away from such organizations as Narcotics Anonymous, instead opting {{to create their own}} twelve-step fellowships (such as Methadone Anonymous) or depart entirely from the twelve-step model of recovery, seeking a program which is secular and based on science (such as SMART Recovery) rather than faith.|$|E
25|$|Socially {{the island}} is highly diverse, with the {{creative}} sector (artists, musicians, scientists, writers, poets and actors) and eccentrics strongly represented. It has 1,206 businesses but around 1,000 people commute daily to Auckland as career opportunities are limited. 60.9 per cent of the residents are in employment. The main employment sectors are hospitality (23 per cent) and retail (15%) followed by education, agriculture/horticulture and healthcare (10% each). Gentrification and land speculation is having an impact, with high rates and mortgage interest rates forcing <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> fixed incomes to relocate. New Zealand council rates are based on land and building valuations, which take into account potential value for redevelopment even if the owners live on the property and have no intention to sell or redevelop. The cost of living is higher compared to the mainland, due to the shipping-freight costs of most foodstuffs, fuel and amenities.|$|E

This caused local controversy, as <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> Bjorøy disagreed that the tolls on the Bjorøy Tunnel should pay for the Tyssøy Bridge. On 13 May 1993, the costs of the connection to Tyssøy were estimated at NOK5 million. The issue was not resolved when the construction of the tunnel started. The original costs for the bridge were for NOK11.4 million, including a [...] bridge with a clearance of [...] This was later reduced to [...] length and , which reduced the costs to NOK9.4 million. Of this, the county paid NOK4 million, while the two municipalities had advanced the transporting earthwork from the tunnel to the sound. On 22 January 1996, the tunnel company agreed to advance the construction costs and collect it from the tolls, with Sund Municipality guaranteeing for the debt.|$|E

2500|$|The {{group was}} for a while under the {{protective}} wing of Romanian poet Miron Radu Paraschivescu, a Communist Party member who was generally seen as anti-dogmatic, and whose personal opinions were veering toward Trotskyism. According to Ţepeneag, Paraschivescu, who was a former Surrealist, aimed at uniting avant-garde trends {{as a means to}} revitalize cultural life in Romania. This relationship allowed them to publish their works in his Povestea Vorbei, a supplement of the magazine Ramuri in Craiova. Ţepeneag's work of the time was part of a Romanian intellectual reaction against Realism and Socialist realism, and coincided with the climate of liberalization at the end of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's period in power and the rise of Nicolae Ceauşescu. In particular, the period was marked by developments at Luceafărul: in 1968, the hardliner Eugen Barbu, who had attacked Ţepeneag and other young authors, was replaced by the liberal Ştefan Bănulescu as editor-in-chief of the magazine. Literary critic Gabriel Dimisianu indicated that, at first, Romanian authorities tended to ignore the Oniric grouping, whom they viewed as [...] "benign" [...] and [...] "a small racket caused by <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> the margin".|$|E
2500|$|The Arkansas National Guard's {{actions in}} the face of intense {{national}} scrutiny were applauded by <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>on</b> both sides of the Central High School Integration Crisis. [...] Harry Ashmore, editor of the Arkansas Gazette newspaper, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing [...] "for the forcefulness, dispassionate analysis and clarity of his editorials on the school integration conflict in Little Rock", said that no one, whatever their beliefs on school integration, could feel anything but admiration for the way the Arkansas Guardsmen went calmly about their duties, steering clear of partisan pressure. [...] Superintendent of Little Rock Schools, Virgil Blossom, was also quoted as saying, [...] "I have nothing but praise for the Guardsmen {{and the manner in which}} they performed a trying job under difficult circumstances." [...] They were not, however, applauded by at least one member of the Little Rock Nine. [...] In her memoir about her experience at Central High, Melba Pattillo Beals recalls demanding a meeting with General Sherman T. Clinger of the Arkansas National Guard after the guardsmen [...] "stood by, socializing and flirting, while we were being beaten within an inch of our lives." [...] According to Beals, Clinger did not deny the charges, but merely explained that his men had to live in the community. [...] She further described the eighteen guardsmen selected as bodyguards after this meeting as the [...] "biggest, dumbest, most disheveled hayseeds I'd ever seen."Others recall the inside-the-school guardsmen as neat with starched and pressed khakis, and dispute the allegation of beatings.|$|E
