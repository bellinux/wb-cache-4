500|$|Emma Thompson {{prepared}} {{for her role}} by studying Travers' own recordings conducted during the development of Mary Poppins, and also styled her natural hair after Travers', due to the actress's disdain for wigs. To accurately convey Walt Disney's midwestern dialect, Tom Hanks listened to archival recordings of Disney and practiced the voice while reading newspapers. Hanks also grew his own mustache for the role, which underwent heavy scrutiny, with the filmmakers {{going so far as}} to match the dimensions of Hanks' mustache to that of Disney's. Jason Schwartzman and B. J. Novak worked closely with Richard M. Sherman during pre-production and filming. Sherman described the actors as [...] "perfect talents" [...] for their roles as himself and his brother, Robert. Costume designer Daniel Orlandi had Thompson wear authentic jewelry borrowed from the Walt Disney Family Museum, and ensured that Hanks' wardrobe included the <b>Smoke</b> <b>Tree</b> Ranch emblem from the Palm Springs property embroidered on his neckties, which Disney always wore. The design department also had to recreate several of the costumed Disney characters as they appeared in the 1960s. Filming lasted nine weeks and was completed on November 22, 2012. Walt Disney Animation Studios reproduced an animation of Tinker Bell for the scene that recreates an opening segment from an episode of Walt Disney Presents.|$|E

[...] The most notable life forms on the planet are the giant sandworms and their immature forms of sandtrout and sandplankton. Sandtrout encyst any water deposits; predator fish are placed in the qanats and other water storage areas {{to protect them from}} the sandtrout. It is suggested the sandworms are an introduced species that caused the desertification of Arrakis; In Children of Dune (1976), Leto II Atreides explains to his twin sister Ghanima: ...|$|E
50|$|Vegetation is {{dominated}} by the creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), which is widespread. The saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) and the ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens) are common on the bajadas, while many of the desert trees found are restricted to dry watercourses; these include paloverde (Parkinsonia), the desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), desert ironwood (Olneya tesota), and <b>smoke</b> <b>trees</b> (Psorothamnus spinosus).|$|R
5000|$|The rust colored mountains, which cover 46,758 acres, were {{designated}} the Dead Mountains Wilderness in 1994 by the United States Congress.

5000|$|The <b>smoke</b> <b>trees,</b> {{particularly}} C. coggygria, {{are popular}} garden shrubs. Several bronze or purple-leaved cultivars of C. coggygria have been selected, with warm pink inflorescences set against purple-black foliage; {{the most common}} in commerce are 'Notcutt's Variety' and 'Royal Purple'. When brought into cultivation together, the two species will form hybrids; some garden cultivars are of this parentage.|$|R

It listed by the California Native Plant Society as rare in California, but is more common elsewhere in the lower Sonoran Deserts.|$|R
50|$|Well-known plant genera in the Faboideae which exhibit this corolla {{morphology}} include beans, peas, sweet peas, alfalfa (lucerne), clovers, lupines, <b>smoke</b> <b>trees,</b> black locusts, locoweeds {{and coral}} trees. The flowers of coral trees are diadelphous and are considered papilionaceous, but the wings are much reduced, suggesting a flower with three petals. Their keel petals are elongate, fused together and sometimes tubular to facilitate pollination by certain bird groups, while secondary compounds in their nectar seem to repel bees.|$|R

It covers 1.6 km² (395 acres) and consists of a natural pine-cypress forest, hills with maple <b>trees,</b> <b>smoke</b> <b>trees</b> and persimmon trees, as well as landscaped areas with traditional architecture and cultural relics.

Examples of dynamic textures in video include fire, <b>smoke,</b> <b>trees</b> in the wind, clouds, sky, ocean waves etc. The fire is {{characterized}} using efficient features and detection of the same using a suitable processing. Every pixel is checked for {{the presence or absence}} of fire using color features, and periodic behavior in fire regions is also analyzed. In this paper we use combined approach of color detection, motion detection and area dispersion to detect fire in video data. Firstly, the algorithm locates desired color regions in video frames, and then determines the region in the video where there is any movement, and in the last step we calculate the pixel area of the frame. The combination of color, motion and area clues is used to detect fire in the video...|$|R

A hundred rescue workers were parachuted into {{the area where the}} aircraft disappeared. The search efforts eventually involved sixteen aircraft and 441 people in total. The search was difficult because of the large territory and the inaccessibility of the area. Ground vehicles were not able to reach the area where the Il-76 disappeared. The high temperatures combined with the low visibility from the thick <b>smoke</b> and <b>trees</b> made the operations difficult, especially for ground units.
