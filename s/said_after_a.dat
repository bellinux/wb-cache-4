5|$|In the National Football League (NFL), a tied game {{occurs when}} a regular season game ends with both teams having an equal score. Since the National Hockey League {{eliminated}} ties by adopting the shootout following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the NFL {{is the only one}} of the four major professional sports leagues in North America to have tied games in regular-season play, as Major League Baseball (in the modern era since 1900) and the National Basketball Association have historically played until there is a winner. Unlike soccer (association football), in which teams routinely play for a draw (for the benefit of a point in the standings), NFL teams rarely play for ties. In general, tied games in the NFL are frowned upon by both teams and fans. Because tied games are rare, some players have not known they were allowed in the NFL, such as former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, who <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> tie game against the Cincinnati Bengals that he did not know a tie was a possible result.|$|E

25|$|Google has yet {{to receive}} {{permission}} to launch its Street View feature in India. The country is worried about Google’s plans to put Indian cities, tourist spots, hills and rivers in an application in which one can explore through 360-degree, panoramic and street level imagery because terrorists are using these maps to plan terrorist attacks in India. Official sources <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> detailed analysis by security agencies and defense forces feel that allowing Google to cover India would compromise the country’s security interest. Once the proposed Geo spatial Information Regulation Bill, 2016 comes into force, issues related to internet-based application would be resolved in India.|$|E

500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} for The Beatles Anthology, however, McCartney disagreed with Lennon's recollections, recalling {{that it was}} the Beatles, and not Lester, who had come {{up with the idea of}} using Starr's verbal misstep: [...] "The title was Ringo's. We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session ... and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong. And he <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> concert, 'Phew, it's been a hard day's night.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Wiescamp had Skipper W {{trained as}} a riding horse {{when he was a}} two-year-old, and the ranch hand who did the {{training}} <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> couple of days of working him in a small corral, he [...] "just got on him. And the first time I got on him, I just turned this colt around, clucked to him, and just kind of spanked him with the rein a little bit. And the colt took to it and just walked off. That's the way he was. The colt never hopped up, he never done nothing." [...] The same ranch hand later used Skipper W as a roping horse, and said that the horse really liked to do ranch work. At the age of three years, Skipper W was about 15 hands high ( [...] and weighed about [...]|$|E
500|$|A Fast-Track {{audition}} {{that was}} to be held at SM City Sta. Mesa was canceled, leading to complaints from hopefuls and their parents. [...] After hours of waiting, a representative of ABC arrived and relocated each of the 160 frustrated applicants to other scheduled screening. [...] Meanwhile, Filipinos living in Mindanao reacted negatively to what Philippine Idol judges <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> low Gold Pass turnout at the Davao Main Auditions, with Corrales (a Cebuana herself) saying that [...] "Davao {{is not the place to}} look for an Idol" [...] and [...] "all the good ones are in Cebu". [...] Corrales later clarified in the Wildcard Round that she said such a statement because of the low turnout in the Davao auditions and the even lower Gold Pass output. She added that [...] "Davao's best talents" [...] might have probably auditioned earlier in Manila.|$|E

500|$|The episode also {{received}} some criticism. Dan Compora of Airlock Alpha <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> run of [...] "several strong" [...] episodes, Lost [...] "has slipped into mediocrity. While {{none of the}} recent episodes have been bad, they haven't been anything special. For a hundredth episode, average simply isn't good enough. While the shooting of Daniel at the end was stunning, I expected something much more {{from the rest of}} the episode than learning the identity of Daniel's parents." [...] A reviewer for TVoholic.com thought the episode was good, though not as good as [...] "The Constant", and he thought [...] "it came with lots of answers and references to past episodes from this season and the ones before it, making it all the more exciting." [...] The reviewer would, however, have [...] "loved any sort of explanation as to why [...] changed his mind about changing the past or how he thought this could work. There must have been something that made Daniel think this was possible, but he was in such a rush that he never took care to explain." [...] Jon Lachonis of TVOvermind said that as an internal character piece, [...] "The Variable" [...] was not [...] "so much a great ending for Daniel. We brushed up against many key events and people – Theresa, Daniel’s ‘nurse’, and the Widmore and Eloise parental connection, etc. – but these forays into the geniuses’ past events were more to thread Daniel through the plot than to establish their connection to who Daniel truly was." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1968, Florida Governor Claude Kirk <b>said,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> {{visit to}} the school where he found {{overcrowding}} and poor conditions, that [...] "somebody should have blown the whistle a long time ago." [...] At this time, the school housed 564 boys, some for offenses as minor as school truancy, running away from home, or [...] "incorrigibility". They {{ranged in age from}} ten to sixteen years old. Officially, corporal punishment at the school was banned in August 1968.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2012, the Pakistani Taliban issued {{death threats}} {{if he went}} ahead with his march to their tribal stronghold along the Afghan border to protest US drone attacks, because he calls himself a [...] "liberal" [...] – a term they {{associate}} {{with a lack of}} religious belief. On 1 October 2012, prior to his plan to address a rally in South Waziristan, senior commanders of Pakistani Taliban <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> meeting headed by the Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud that they now offered Khan security assistance for the rally because of Khan's opposition to drone attacks in Pakistan, reversing their previous stance.|$|E
6000|$|Even the solidly-founded self-possession of Bishopriggs {{himself was}} {{shaken by the}} startling {{directness}} of that attack on it. His glib tongue was paralyzed for the moment.

Jamie Fellner of Human Rights Watch <b>said</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> tour of the facility, [...] "The Bureau of Prisons has taken a harsh punitive model and implemented {{it as well as}} anybody I know." [...] Notorious escape artist Richard Lee McNair wrote to a journalist from his cell in 2009 to say [...] "Thank God for prisons [...] There are some very sick people in here...

2500|$|...

'He calls all colored people George.'" [...] When Gates's cousin became the first black cheerleader at the local high school, she was not allowed to sit with the team and drink Coke from a glass but had to stand at the counter drinking from a paper cup.

2500|$|Sometime {{in the mid}} 200s, Gongsun Du {{gathered}} all {{his subordinates}} and asked them, [...] "I heard that Lord Cao is away on a campaign.

After Gongsun Du sought his opinion, Liang Mao replied, [...] "The Han Empire {{is in a state}} of chaos and on the brink of collapse. General, you command thousands of troops, yet you sit here and watch others attack and destroy each other. As a subject of the Han Empire, is this what you should be doing? Lord Cao is concerned about the Han Empire's future and the people's welfare, which is why he leads an army of righteousness to eliminate tyrants and villains. He has made immense contributions and his virtues are well-known. There is none other like him in the Han Empire. As peace and stability has just recently been restored, it is only a matter of time before everyone starts pointing fingers at you, General, for not doing anything to save the Han Empire. Now, General, you want to lead your forces west to attack Ye? All it takes is one morning to find out the result of this test of survival and destruction.
