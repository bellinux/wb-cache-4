5|$|Rush {{set up as}} a <b>store-keeper</b> in {{the town}} of Rocky Mouth (Maclean). He {{operated}} a 'floating store' which was anchored at Chatsworth Island during the sugar-cane harvesting season when hundreds of itinerant labourers moved into the district. His steam launch Jinnie Rush was used as a mobile general store, delivering goods to farmers and villagers along the river. Rush also bought several racing boats, importing ‘riggers’ from England, as well as ordering them custom-made from local boat-builders.|$|E
25|$|Barnum {{was born}} in Bethel, Connecticut, the son of inn keeper, tailor and <b>store-keeper</b> Philo Barnum (1778–1826) and second wife Irene Taylor. He was the third great {{grandson}} of Thomas Barnum (1625–1695), the English immigrant ancestor of the Barnum family in North America. His maternal grandfather Phineas Taylor was a Whig, legislator, landowner, justice of the peace, and lottery schemer, {{and he had a}} great influence on his favorite grandson. Barnum was adept at arithmetic but hated physical work. He started as a <b>store-keeper,</b> and he learned haggling and using deception to make a sale. He was involved with the first lottery mania in the United States. At the age of 19, he married Charity Hallett.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{known as}} Balnarring East, the [...] town was renamed for a popular former Governor of Victoria {{who set up}} the local Lord Somers Camp. The {{subdivision}} of Somers began in 1925, whilst the Boulevard Cafe & Post Office commenced business in 1927, the address then still being Balnarring East. After much correspondence with the Education Dept. the Palm Beach School No. 4458 opened 1929. The renaming of the town occurred in 1930. Despite a few very small land subdivisions for housing, Somers has not seen any major development since the 1920s and has retained much of its remnant bush land on the foreshore. Initially as the land had been used for grazing, the estates were bare until local residents led by local <b>store-keeper</b> Ron Stone planted many trees throughout the area.|$|E
60|$|Patsy {{decided she}} would shop at {{each and every}} store in the place, and engage the <b>store-keepers</b> in {{conversation}} about the election.|$|R
60|$|This bit {{of humor}} caused a {{laugh at the}} <b>store-keeper's</b> expense, {{and put him in}} even worse humor than had Matt's caustic remarks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, most of {{the folks}} come around here and over across {{the way to the}} general stores. But I reckon the <b>store-keepers</b> won't like you around much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{a mighty}} big boy!" [...] sneered the <b>store-keeper,</b> but all {{noticed that he}} retreated several steps toward the open doorway.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course! of course!" [...] responded the <b>store-keeper</b> eagerly. [...] "I can't {{afford to}} lose forty-five dollars' worth of stuff at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Make him send fifty," [...] {{amended the}} <b>store-keeper.</b> [...] "You can't buy a cow, an' pigs, an' chickens, an' make repairs on much less." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jardine smiled. [...] "Then I {{expect to}} sell the ranch and push on again. The old-time bushman has no use for game-wardens, city sports, <b>store-keepers</b> and {{real-estate}} boomers----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An {{intoxicated}} man never {{makes a good}} customer, Matt. Some <b>store-keepers</b> try to get {{his money}} away from him, but, as for me, I {{want nothing to do}} with him." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{found that}} the firemen's parade was really to be very large, and already the <b>store-keepers</b> were decorating in its honor. On the streets {{numerous}} fakirs were about, offering badges, medals, song-sheets, souvenirs, and other wares for sale.|$|R
60|$|And {{as the old}} {{fellow in}} {{question}} appeared in sight, the <b>store-keeper</b> dropped down behind the rail fence, leaving Matt to face Joe Yedley alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. As I understand," [...] {{crackled}} the <b>store-keeper,</b> [...] "her husband's turned up. Folks {{over there}} seem to think't he's got {{his eye on the}} other doctor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{must say}} I didn't see your face," [...] said the constable, who, {{although}} {{a friend of}} the <b>store-keeper,</b> was yet disposed to be fair and square.|$|E
60|$|The <b>store-keepers</b> and the hotel-keeper who {{suffered}} through Ward Porton's misrepresentations could get {{nothing from the}} young culprit, but they had the satisfaction of knowing that he had now been put {{where it would be}} impossible for him to dupe others.|$|R
50|$|Richardson {{completed}} a B.A. at the University of Sydney {{and later became}} well known for his contributions {{to a number of}} Sydney and Australian periodicals and newspapers. He was {{also a member of the}} firm of Richardson and Company, an Armidale-based millers and general <b>store-keepers,</b> started by his father.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} another person had offered a dollar {{and a half}} for the album, and Matt was hard at work {{trying to get a}} raise on this figure. But he overheard the <b>store-keeper's</b> words, and his face flushed with indignation. He stopped short, and pointed {{directly}} at the man.|$|R
60|$|The earnest {{manner in}} which Larry made this appeal was {{received}} with a laugh by the bystanders, and a recommendation to the <b>store-keeper</b> to give him what he wanted.|$|E
6000|$|... "This young rascal {{threw them}} there!" [...] cried the <b>store-keeper,</b> shaking Matt's arm savagely. [...] "You imp! {{tell me where}} the other things are at once, or I'll skin you alive!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's hear it," [...] remarked Cotting, the <b>store-keeper,</b> a fat {{individual}} with a bald head, who was counting matches from a shelf {{into the public}} match-box. He allowed [...] "the boys" [...] just twenty free matches a day.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{large numbers}} of East African Indians, {{predominantly}} Gujaratis but also sizeable numbers of Punjabis who already held British passports, entered the UK after they were expelled from Kenya, Uganda and Zanzibar. Many of these people had been <b>store-keepers</b> and wholesale retailers in Africa and opened shops when they arrived in the UK.|$|R
60|$|That evening Abe made {{a bargain}} {{to bring up}} goods from Sacramento {{for one of the}} <b>store-keepers,</b> having {{previously}} found the rate which was current. At daybreak next morning he and Frank started off on horseback, each with three horses tied, head and tail, behind the one he was riding, Turk marching gravely by their side.|$|R
6000|$|Thirdly,--But {{that which}} did not a little amuse the <b>store-keepers</b> was, that these pilgrims set very light by all their wares. They cared {{not so much as}} to look upon them; and if they called upon them to buy, they would put their fingers in their ears, and cry, [...] "Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity," [...] and look upwards, {{signifying}} that their trade and traffic were in heaven.|$|R
60|$|The two above {{heard him}} rummaging {{around in the}} loose stones and among the brush for all of five minutes. Both listened for some call from him, the <b>store-keeper</b> all the while keeping a tight hold on Matt's arm.|$|E
60|$|These {{things were}} not thrown {{together}} in confusion, but arranged in systematic order, as if under the management of an expert <b>store-keeper,</b> and a desk with business-books on it seemed to indicate that a careful record was kept of the whole.|$|E
6000|$|This little {{incident}} {{served to}} make Matt many friends. People {{always like to}} see persons stick up for their rights, and {{in this particular case}} they were pleased to see the mean <b>store-keeper</b> [...] "talked-down," [...] as he well deserved to be.|$|E
60|$|A {{portion of}} the cargo was landed at Akyah. Stanley went down with the rest to Martaban, and his uncle sailed for Chittagong. A few months later, a store was opened at Rangoon. Parsee <b>store-keepers</b> were sent from Calcutta, by Tom Pearson; and these were placed {{in control of the}} stores there, and at Martaban--Stanley being in charge of these two stations, and Akyah; and having a native craft of his own, and a boat for river work similar to that of his uncle.|$|R
60|$|As he strolled {{toward the}} fair-ground, George became {{interested}} in the crowd. It was largely composed of small farmers, and almost without exception they and their wives were smartly attired; they looked contented and prosperous. Mingling with them were teamsters, many as neatly dressed as their masters, though some wore blue-jean and saffron-colored shirts; and there were railroad-hands, mechanics, and <b>store-keepers.</b> All of them were cheerful; a few good years, free from harvest frost and blight, had made a marked improvement in everybody's lot.|$|R
60|$|When I went in {{the saloon}} was fairly full. A group of {{business}} men stood together at the bar, discussing affairs, and in a corner two Kanakas were drinking. Two or three men {{who might have been}} <b>store-keepers</b> were shaking dice. The rest of the company plainly followed the sea; they were captains of tramps, first mates, and engineers. Behind the bar, busily making the Honolulu cocktail for which the place was famous, served two large half-castes, in white, fat, clean-shaven and dark skinned, with thick, curly hair and large bright eyes.|$|R
60|$|But Yedley {{would not}} remain still, {{and as a}} consequence, a fierce {{struggle}} ensued. Matt called to Isaac Marvelling {{to come to his}} assistance, but the <b>store-keeper</b> was too afraid to do so, and only screamed for Jackson to come and secure the thief.|$|E
60|$|For {{the moment}} Matt could {{do little more}} than stare at the two men that confronted him. In a dim way he {{realized}} that Isaac Marvelling's store had been entered and robbed, and that the mean-minded <b>store-keeper</b> fully believed that he was the guilty party.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello! I {{wonder what}} Mr. Dickley wants of me," [...] Dave mused, {{as he turned}} the letter over. Then he remembered how sour the <b>store-keeper</b> had {{appeared}} when they had met the day before. [...] "Maybe {{he wants to know}} why I haven't bought anything from him lately." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The city {{may be said}} to die, when Congress adjourns. Its life is {{political}}, {{and when}} its political motor ceases to move the city lies sprawled out like a dead thing. Its streets are painfully quiet. Its street cars shuttle to and fro under the burning sun, and its teamsters loaf about the corners drowsily. The <b>store-keepers</b> keep shop, of course, but they open lazily of a morning and close early at night. The whole city yawns and rests and longs for the coming of the autumn and Congress.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There was {{one thing}} they boggled at, and almost shut th' gate i' my face for, and that were my dog Blast, th' only one saved out o' a litter o' pups as was blowed up when a keg o' minin' powder loosed off in th' <b>store-keeper's</b> hut. They liked his name no better than his business, which were fightin' every dog he comed across; a rare good dog, wi' spots o' black and pink on his face, one ear gone, and lame o' one side wi' being driven in a basket through an iron roof, a matter of half a mile.|$|R
60|$|In an {{economical}} light, I must {{observe that}} {{the construction of}} such granaries throughout the kingdom would be at an expense beyond all calculation. The keeping them up would be at a great charge. The management and attendance would require an army of agents, <b>store-keepers,</b> clerks, and servants. The capital to be employed in the purchase of grain would be enormous. The waste, decay, and corruption would be a dreadful drawback on the whole dealing; and the dissatisfaction of the people, at having decayed, tainted, or corrupted corn sold to them, as must be the case, would be serious.|$|R
