5|$|In {{the distant}} future, deadly solar flares force {{humanity}} to evacuate Earth on giant, nationalistic colony ships. The Doctor and Amy arrive on Starship UK, {{one of the}} last ships to leave and holding the population of the United Kingdom. Amy tends to a crying young girl ignored by adults while the Doctor, curious to the ship's engines, seeks the control room. He finds the room to be a false front, and encounters Liz 10, who <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{returns to}} Earth {{in time for}} the launch of the second NX class starship, Columbia, and Commander Tucker prepares for his transfer. Meanwhile, Ensign Sato and Doctor Phlox are {{attacked}} in San Francisco, and Phlox is kidnapped. Captain Archer and Lieutenant Reed investigate the scene, and Reed is given a secret assignment by a secretive agent that he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> Commander T'Pol, seeking information from Sato, conducts her first mind-meld, and the two realize that the attackers spoke Rigelian. They discover that a Rigelian freighter recently left orbit and head off in pursuit.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, the world is trapped in a time loop, and only one woman, named Pam (Carrie Hamilton), <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> Each day the events that happen differ slightly. A bank robbery is committed {{over and over again}} until finally the eventual bombing of the building is prevented. Somehow, Mulder and Scully are trapped {{in the middle of it}} all.|$|E

5|$|Following mass vaccinations, disease {{detection}} and containment were {{central to the}} eradication campaign. As soon as cases were detected, the victims were isolated as were their close contacts, who were vaccinated. Successes came quickly; by 1970 smallpox was no longer endemic in western Africa, nor, by 1971, in Brazil. By 1973, smallpox remained endemic only in the Indian sub-continent, Botswana and Ethiopia. Finally, after 13 years of coordinated disease surveillance and vaccination campaigns throughout the world, the World Health Organisation declared smallpox eradicated in 1979. Although the main weapon used was vaccinia virus, which {{was used as the}} vaccine, no one <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> exactly where vaccinia virus came from; it is not the strain of cowpox that Edward Jenner used, and it is not a weakened form of smallpox.|$|E
5|$|In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find {{a picture}} of him with Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered body in a trash bag. The agents report to Skinner, with Mulder believing that Sandoz is being framed and that the {{artifact}} emits galactic radiation. He also <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that someone else is involved on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after the agents leave, Skinner hands a video tape of their conversation to Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels to New Mexico and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included passages from the Bible. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the university to tail Barnes, but is overcome by his headache and passes out in the stairwell.|$|E

25|$|Alicia, a teacher, and Roberto, a {{government}} agent, live in Buenos Aires with their adopted daughter, Gaby. On Gaby's fifth birthday, Alicia wonders about Gaby's real parents, a topic {{her husband has}} told her to ignore, although he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{the story of his}} daughter's adoption.|$|E
25|$|The {{class is}} going to the weather station to learn about weather. However, on the way there the bus turns into a hot air balloon. Eventually they find {{themselves}} inside a hurricane.

25|$|Bacon {{was usually}} careful to cite his sources {{but does not}} mention Shakespeare once in any of his work. Baconians claim, furthermore, that, if the Gesta Grayorum was {{circulated}} prior to its publication in 1688 – and no one <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if it was – it was probably only {{among members of the}} Inns of Court.|$|E
25|$|Maometto {{and his men}} {{enter the}} city, which he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> well. Selim is curious as to why, but his general reveals nothing. Then {{soldiers}} rush in and announce that Erisso and Calbo have been captured. Both men are led in, in chains. Maometto recognizes their gallantry, but demands that they and their men surrender and states that then all will be released. By his silence, Erisso rejects the offer and, as the two {{are about to be}} led away to be tortured, Anna and the women appear from the church.|$|E
25|$|The main {{trouble with}} Kurzman's {{interesting}} {{book is the}} author's credulity; he uncritically accepts the validity of controversial documents and unquestioningly believes in the statements made {{to him by his}} principal German interlocutor, the former SS General Karl Wolff, who died in 1984. The book's documentation is modest; the short notes and index contain a great number of vague or inaccurate references. Moreover, it is difficult to believe the arguments of an author who so manifestly lacks the language abilities needed for his work. Kurzman <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Italian but no German; he misspells German names and uses almost no German-language sources.|$|E

25|$|Of {{the four}} protagonists, Mihai {{is the most}} level-headed, experienced, and least anti-heroic of the group. Despite his old age and being human, Mihai has skills that equate or even exceed most of the cast. However, Mihai has a terrible sense of {{direction}} and has a constant run of bad luck. He and Badou share a close bond along with Kiri and Mimi, and also shares concern for Heine and Naoto. So far, his link to the underground is not as deep as the others, but Richter Berthein <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{a great deal about}} the assassin.|$|E
25|$|Later, they board a {{submarine}} that carries refugees to Canada. To avoid satellite detection, the submarine abandons and shoots some refugees. Aurora, infuriated {{by the loss}} of life, operates the 30-year-old submarine without training. Sister Rebeka tells Toorop that Aurora could speak nineteen different languages by the age of two, and always <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> things she has never learned. Three months before leaving with Toorop, she began acting differently. This occurred after a Noelite doctor administered a pill. The doctor tells her to go to New York City and arranges for Toorop to take them.|$|E
25|$|Taz is {{generally}} {{portrayed as a}} ferocious, albeit dim-witted, omnivore with a notoriously short temper and little patience. Though he can be very devious, he is also sweet at times. His enormous appetite <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> no bounds, as he will eat anything in his path. He {{is best known for}} his speech consisting mostly of grunts, growls, and rasps (in his earlier appearances, he does speak English with primitive grammar) as well as his ability to spin like a vortex and bite through nearly anything. Taz does have one weakness: he can be calmed by almost any music. While in this calm state, he can be easily dealt with.|$|E

25|$|Lars van der Hooten: Mia's very {{protective}} bodyguard. He voices his mind {{in a way}} that is annoying when he thinks Mia is being particularly ridiculous, but goes along with her schemes anyway. He also turns a blind eye to Mia and Michael when they make out, for which Mia is grateful. He gets on very well with Michael (especially in the first book when Lars <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that Michael likes Mia), never offers any opinion on Lilly, and becomes friends with Tina's bodyguard, Wahim. Lars also likes Mia's French teacher Mademoiselle Klein. He is known to be a 'big softie' deep down inside.|$|E
25|$|Morgan {{gets back}} {{together}} with Hunter, and during a family dinner with Hunter, Mary K finally finds {{out the truth}} about what Selene had done to her, and how Selene and Cal died. To make things worse, strange occurrences begin to happen in Morgan's presence. Books begin flying and light bulbs explode, and no one <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the cause - thus attributing the blame to Morgan. Morgan's school grades begin to slip and she finds herself having difficulty finding a balance between her school work and a life of Wicca. She is grounded because of it, meaning she cannot go to a circle. At the end, Sky leaves.|$|E
25|$|The First Test between Australia and England {{is played}} {{nowadays}} a Brisbane. Nobody <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why, {{and all sorts}} of arguments are ventilated for and against more cricket Tests on the Woolloongabba ground. I am all in favour of robbing Queensland of its greatest cricketing occasion, for the ground depresses. It is not a cricket ground at all. It is a concentration camp! Wire fences abound. Spectators are herded and sorted out into lots as though for all the world this was a slave market and not a game of cricket. The stands are of wood and filthy to sit on. The dining rooms are barns, without a touch of colour or a picture on the wall. Everywhere there is dust and dirt...The field is rough, although the wicket is usually a good one until it rains. Then it is a strip of turf with thousands of demons prancing up and down...at Brisbane only a Hutton could stay, let alone score runs.|$|E
