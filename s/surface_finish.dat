5|$|The casting {{equipment}} and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit the process to high-volume production. Manufacture of parts using die casting is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, which keeps the incremental cost per item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized castings, which is why die casting produces more castings than any other casting process. Die castings are characterized by a very good <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> (by casting standards) and dimensional consistency.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantage}} of this method {{is that it is}} easily measured with the appropriate equipment. The dis{{advantage of}} this criterion is that it is often irrelevant.

40|$|Introduction: The success {{achieved}} {{by the use of}} composite resins in anterior teeth precipitately leads their use in posterior teeth. However, the indiscriminate application of these materials in cavities with several diverse sizes rapidly pointed out their lack of resistance to oclusal and proximal wear. Objective: To evaluate the surface roughness of composite resin in relation to finishing and polishing technique. Material and methods: Eight experimental groups (n = 15) were divided according to finishing and polishing technique: G 1 – Z 250 TM composite resin without <b>surface</b> <b>finishing</b> and polishing; G 2 – Z 250 TM composite resin plus <b>surface</b> <b>finishing</b> and polishing; G 3 – P 60 TM composite resin without <b>surface</b> <b>finishing</b> and polishing; G 4 – P 60 TM composite resin plus <b>surface</b> <b>finishing</b> and polishing; G 5 – Prodigy CondensableTM composite resin without <b>surface</b> <b>finishing</b> and polishing; G 6 – Prodigy CondensableTM composite resin plus <b>surface</b> <b>finishing</b> and polishing; G 7 – SurefillTM composite resin without <b>surface</b> <b>finishing</b> and polishing; G 8 – Surefill TM composite resin plus <b>surface</b> <b>finishing</b> and polishing. Three packable and one microhybrid (control group) composite resin was used. The surface roughness was measured using a profilometer at three points in each sample. The results were evaluated by ANOVA and Tukey test (p < 0. 05). Results: Prodigy CondensableTM composite resin showed the lowest surface roughness, while Surefill TM showed the highest surface roughness. Comparing the resins used, only between P 60 TM and SurefillTM there were no statistically significant differences (p ≥ 0. 05). Conclusion: Surface roughness was lower in all types of resin composites surfaces in contact with Mylar matrix strip than in areas submitted to finishing and polishing procedure...|$|R
