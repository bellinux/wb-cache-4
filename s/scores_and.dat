30|$|Tensor {{factorization}} {{approaches have}} also been proposed to address the separation task [21]. In [22], a generalized coupled tensor factorization (GCTF) approach is used to jointly include harmonic information from an approximate <b>score</b> <b>and</b> spectral information from instrument recordings. The system uses music scores as prior information but relaxes the alignment constraint between <b>score</b> <b>and</b> audio. The authors showed that a strict alignment between audio <b>and</b> <b>score</b> is not necessary when note co-occurrences, which are {{the same in the}} <b>score</b> <b>and</b> audio signal, are exploited.|$|R

5|$|A few {{recent works}} {{have become a}} part of the modern repertoire, {{including}} <b>scores</b> <b>and</b> theatrical works by composers such as Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Franco Donatoni, and Sylvano Bussotti. These composers are not part of a distinct school or tradition, though they do share certain techniques and influences. By the 1970s, avant-garde classical music had become linked to the Italian Communist Party, while a revival of popular interest continued into the next decade, with foundations, festivals and organization created to promote modern music. Near the end of the 20th century, government sponsorship of musical institutions began to decline, and several RAI choirs and city orchestras were closed. Despite this, a number of composers gained international reputations in the early 21st century.|$|E
