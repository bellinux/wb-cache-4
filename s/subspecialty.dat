5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, the {{emergency}} medicine systems (EMSs) in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore were largely mature, leading some practitioners {{to focus on}} developing the specialty in other countries. Thus, international emergency medicine as a <b>subspecialty</b> began in the 1990s, although some isolated efforts to achieve some of its goals {{had taken place in}} the late 1980s. There were several reasons for the heightened interest these practitioners had in developing emergency medicine abroad. One was the contrast between the EMSs of their countries and the EMSs of other countries. Another was the revolutions of 1989, overthrowing authoritarian regimes, which facilitated spread of new ideas, such as emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|International {{emergency}} medicine is a <b>subspecialty</b> of {{emergency medicine}} that focuses {{not only on}} the global practice of emergency medicine but also on efforts to promote the growth of emergency care as a branch of medicine throughout the world. The term international emergency medicine generally refers to the transfer of skills and knowledgeincluding knowledge of ambulance operations and other aspects of prehospital carefrom developed emergency medical systems (EMSs) to those systems which are less developed. However, this definition has been criticized as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally. From this point of view, international emergency medicine is better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one's native country.|$|E
5|$|Physician: Physicians {{involved}} in patient care may include the primary physician, {{who can provide}} valuable information about patient medical history, and physicians connected to the hospice team. These primarily provide support to other hospice team members, but may also treat the patient directly. The physician <b>subspecialty</b> of Hospice and Palliative Medicine was established in 2006, to provide expertise {{in the care of}} patients with life-limiting, advanced disease and catastrophic injury; the relief of distressing symptoms; the coordination of interdisciplinary patient and family-centered care in diverse settings; the use of specialized care systems including hospice; the management of the imminently dying patient; and legal and ethical decision making in end-of-life care.|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{nephrology}} (or often renal medicine) is a <b>subspecialty</b> {{of general}} medicine.

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Historically, the medical <b>subspecialties</b> have not focused {{on the needs of}} older adults. This has changed with the {{implementation}} of initiatives to integrate geriatrics and aging research into the medical and surgical <b>subspecialties</b> and with the establishment of a home for internal medicine specialists within the annual American Geriatrics Society (AGS) meeting. With the support of AGS, other professional societies, philanthropies, and federal agencies, efforts to integrate geriatrics into the medical and surgical <b>subspecialties</b> have focused largely on training the next generation of physicians and researchers. They have engaged several <b>subspecialties,</b> which have followed parallel paths in integrating geriatrics and aging research. As a result of these combined efforts, there has been enormous progress in the integration of geriatrics and aging research into the medical and surgical <b>subspecialties,</b> and topics once considered to be geriatric concerns are becoming mainstream in medicine, but this integration remains a work in progress and will need to adapt to changes associated with healthcare reform.

Properly organized, minimum 12-month, postgraduate training programs are still being defined in the United States. In some countries, the sleep researchers and the physicians who treat patients may be the same people.|$|E

25|$|Neuropsychiatry is {{a branch}} of {{medicine}} that deals with mental disorders attributable to diseases of the nervous system.

40|$|The voluminous {{amount of}} new {{knowledge}} and the strong academic standing of consultation-liaison psychiatry, old age and forensic psychiatry lead to their establishment as <b>subspecialties</b> of psychiatry in many countries. In this article the Hellenic College of Academic Psychiatry (HCAP) recommend {{the recognition of the}} above mentioned <b>subspecialties</b> in Greece. The HCAP was constituted as an inter-university organization having as one of its aims to coordinate efforts to modernize and harmonize the academic educational programs in psychiatry nationwide in Greece. We also present the process followed by the HCAP members and the final consensus texts reached for training in the three <b>subspecialties.</b> These guidelines specify the special training, knowledge and skills required as well as the organization and assessment of training. Accredited <b>subspecialties</b> programmes increase focus and research in their field as well as upgrading their influence in academic centres, thus contributing to optimisation of the training of medical students and psychiatric residents. Lastly, the accreditation of the three <b>subspecialties</b> will ameliorate the care of patients that belong to specific populations such as patients with medical and psychiatric comorbidity, the elderly who suffer from mental illnesses and the patients who need forensic assessment and intervention.
