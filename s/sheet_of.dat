5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> paper lies flat.|$|E

2500|$|Banknotes {{are printed}} in sheets. Different {{printers}} use different sheet sizes and <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> higher denominations, which are larger in size, would have fewer notes printed per sheet. For example, two German printers print €5 banknotes in <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> 60 (10 rows, designated [...] "A" [...] to [...] "J" [...] and six columns), the <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> €10 notes have 54 banknotes (nine rows, six columns), and €20 banknotes are printed in <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> 45 banknotes (nine rows, five columns).|$|R

5|$|In 1986 Voyager 2 {{detected}} {{a broad and}} faint <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> material inward of ring 6. This ring was given the temporary designation 1986U2R. It had a normal optical depth of 10−3 or less and was extremely faint. It was visible only in a single Voyager 2 image. The ring was located between 37,000 and 39,500km from the centre of Uranus, or only about 12,000km above the clouds. It was not observed again until 2003–2004, when the Keck telescope found a broad and faint <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> material just inside ring 6. This ring was dubbed the ζ ring. However, {{the position of the}} recovered ζ ring differs significantly from that observed in 1986. Now it is situated between 37,850 and 41,350km from the centre of the planet. There is an inward gradually fading extension reaching to at least 32,600km, or possibly even to 27,000km—to the atmosphere of Uranus. These extensions are labelled as the ζc and ζcc rings respectively.|$|E

50|$|Federation and Empire {{itself was}} {{originally}} published in 1986 by Task Force Games (TFG). The rulebook has been revised five times since then. All editions come with 'fleet charts' (<b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> off-map holding areas for excess counters), 'capital charts' (to detail {{the contents of the}} capital systems of the various empires), and the main map. The original set included 10 numbered <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> double-sided counters for ships as well as two <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> single-sided counters for markers and the like.|$|R

50|$|Organic volume, {{similar to}} organic growth, {{is a term}} used in {{business}} to describe the volume of a product produced due to a specific business process and not due to external circumstances such as acquisition from a separate source. For example, imagine a paper company that produces 1 million <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> notebook paper per month from a plant but also buys 500,000 <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> notebook paper at a discount from a surplus supplier in that same month, then sells all 1.5 million <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> paper. The total volume of notebook paper sold is 1.5 million sheets, however the organic volume of notebook paper sold is 1 million <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> paper, since that was the amount actually produced from the paper company's own factory.|$|R
50|$|A {{solution}} of 30 percent pulp and 70 percent water is then mixed {{together in a}} vat. Neri may also {{be added to the}} vat. Nagashi-zuki, the most common technique for making <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> paper, is then employed. The mixture is scooped on a screen and allowed to flow {{back and forth across the}} screen to interlock the fibers. This process is ideal for forming thin <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> paper. The other technique for making paper, tame-zuki, does not use neri and forms thicker <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> paper.|$|R
50|$|The Prince Consort Essay {{was printed}} from electros taken from one master plate of 12. The twelve {{positions}} all have unique characteristics. The essays were printed in red, red-brown, black and blue, in <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> 36 (3 horizontal rows <b>of</b> 12), in <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> 240 and in <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> 252 (21 panes of 12). The essays are scarce {{and there are}} approximately 25 recorded examples perforated 16 by Archer. The majority are imperforate, and there is one rouletted example in the Royal Philatelic Collection.|$|R
5|$|Viewed from {{underneath}} {{between the two}} lobes is the third lobe the flocculonodular lobe. The cerebellum rests {{at the back of}} the cranial cavity, lying beneath the occipital lobes, and is separated from these by the cerebellar tentorium, a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> fibre.|$|E
5|$|A {{drawback}} to {{the device was}} found on 7 March 1948, when the firebox crown <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> Princess Alexandra, a Coronation Pacific of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, failed while hauling a passenger train from Glasgow to London. Enquiries established that both water gauges were defective and on a journey earlier that day {{one or both of}} the fusible plugs had melted, but this had gone unnoticed by the engine crew because of the strong draught carrying the escaping steam away from them.|$|E
5|$|Five single {{sheets of}} bark paper were found {{associated}} with the codex, they had no stucco coating and were brown and water stained. Two of these had adhered to the codex {{and the other three}} may have once been with the codex but had separated. One of these sheets had a painted line in the same red hematite pigment used in the codex itself. A smaller <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> bark paper was attached to the lined sheet and this smaller piece was submitted for radiocarbon dating. This testing produced a date for the <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> AD 1230 ± 130; this would date the document {{to the end of the}} Early Postclassic period (c. 950–1200) and would make the codex the oldest known surviving Mesoamerican codex. The lack of incrustations or insect damage to the codex suggests that, if genuine, it was stored inside a container for hundreds of years. The overall damaged state of the codex conflicts with the good preservation of surviving parts; it may be that the damaged codex was deliberately decommissioned as a ritual object, rather than being simply discarded.|$|E

5|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of gross anatomy, the cerebellar cortex {{appears to be a}} homogeneous <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> tissue, and, from {{the viewpoint}} of microanatomy, all parts of this sheet appear to have the same internal structure. There are, however, a number of respects in which the structure of the cerebellum is compartmentalized. There are large compartments that are generally known as zones; these can be divided into smaller compartments known as microzones.|$|E
5|$|Its two {{drivers are}} a 180mm paper woofer and a 35mm soft-domed tweeter. The woofer's diaphragm, {{weighing}} 3.7g, is manufactured from a flat <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> pressed pulp paper. Unconventionally, it is formed into conical shape not through moulding or pressure, but by curling and then gluing the two ends together. Against the black finish of the cabinet, the white bass/mid driver cone is a distinctive and iconic {{feature of the}} product.|$|E
5|$|Jet stream-powered cirrus {{can grow}} {{long enough to}} stretch across continents while {{remaining}} only a few kilometers deep. When visible light interacts with the ice crystals in cirrus cloud, it produces optical phenomena such as sun dogs and halos. Cirrus is known to raise {{the temperature of the}} air beneath the main cloud layer by an average of 10°C (18°F). When the individual filaments become so extensive that they are virtually indistinguishable from one another, they form a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> high cloud called cirrostratus. Convection at high altitudes can produce another high-based genus called cirrocumulus, a pattern of small cloud tufts that contain droplets of supercooled water.|$|E
