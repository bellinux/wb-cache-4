40|$|Abstract. Co-pyrolysis of <b>slop</b> <b>oil</b> with {{ferrocene}} {{was carried}} out to convert waste of petroleum into carbon nanoparticles (CNPs). Since <b>slop</b> <b>oil</b> {{is a mixture of}} hydrocarbons (HCs) with broad molecular weight distribution, it could be simply fractionated into some certain fractions by batch distillation. Distillate containing hydrocarbons with small molecules was mainly focused as an alternative carbon source for synthesis of CNPs. A two-stage furnace was employed for evaporating a mixture of distillated <b>slop</b> <b>oil</b> and ferrocene at 200 °C in the 1 st stage of the furnace and then formation of CNPs at 900 °C could be observed in the 2 nd stage. Laboratory-grade ferrocene was mixed with <b>slop</b> <b>oil</b> with a designated weight-ratio of 1 : 2. Microscopic analyses based on SEM and TEM micrographs reveals that CNPs obtained from distillated <b>slop</b> <b>oil</b> mostly consist of bundles of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with nominal diameters of 20 - 50 nm. Raman spectroscopic analyses of the synthesized CNPs exhibit the notably high value of IG/ID, suggesting that the synthesized CNPs preferably consist of graphitic nanostructure. Moreover, TGA analysis shows that 39. 8 and 32. 9 wt % of Fe contents exist in the CNP samples synthesized from original <b>slop</b> <b>oil</b> and distillated <b>slop</b> <b>oil,</b> respectively...|$|E
40|$|Although {{emulsions}} {{are very}} useful and desired products in cosmetic,food and soft drink industries,yet {{they are considered}} as troublesome and undesired product in petroleum industries wherein;they eventually need to be broken into pure oil and water. The current demulsification techniques that consist of mainly chemicals together with mechanical, heating and electrical methods are not very good,since chemical for instance are costly and harmful to the environment,mechanical techniques such as gravity settling tank,hydrocyclone vessel,centrifugal separators, and steam stripping are large requiring more space and cost, electrical techniques almost always work in a very high voltage that can easily cause fire via short circuit, {{the objective of this}} project is to assess the effectiveness of some other integrated techniques that have not being fully developed,namely microwave and ultrasonic techniques integrated with chemicals for the purpose of reducing or eliminating the chemical demusifiers, another objective of the current project is also to formulate a stable emulsion that resemble the natural emulsion,this in turn generated another interesting objective of decolorizing the crude oil for microscopic droplet size analysis of heavy oil. A massive screening was carried out to fix the optimal parameters in making a stable w/o emulsios these including stirring intensity, emulsifiers’ types and concentration and water volume fraction,the results showed that the optimal parameters to produce w/o emulsions were 0. 25 % (v/v) emulsifiers concentration(Span 80) with mixing speed of 1600 rpm for 7 minutes. From the demulsification process it was observed that when chemical assisted microwave was used a demulsifiers’ concentration of 0. 1 % with two minutes irradiation time gave the best separation efficiency for 50 - 50 % w/o emulsions, while for 20 - 80 % w/o emulsions; 0. 05 % demulsifiers concentration and 3. 5 minutes irradiation time gave the best water separation of 60 %. Chemical assisted ultrasonic also was found to be very effective, when emulsions were sonicated with 0. 7 %(v/v) of demulsifiers. Hence ultrasonic-chemical integrated system gave the highest separation rate for water-in-crude oil emulsions which reached 97 % at power level of 3,compare to microwave-chemical integrated system which gave maximum separation efficiency of 87 % at the aforementioned concentration of 0. 1 %. However when the demulsifiers were increased to 0. 7 % microwave had given a maximum separation of 96 %,Microwave also was tested in some other real industrial emulsions namely <b>Slop</b> <b>oil</b> emulsion and waste coolant emulsion and gave very high separation as expected. Fundamentally the basic mechanism behind the effectiveness of microwave demulsification is that the electromagnetic wave that induce the water molecules to move as trying to rearrange themselves with the wave in two distinct mechanisms known as ionic conduction and dipole rotation that would eventually convert the wave energy into heat generated within the water molecules,while for ultrasonic demulsification it is normally governed by the pressure exerted by the sound wave on the droplets as they travel through the emulsion medium, hence the compression refraction form of the wave motion would make the suspended water droplet to aggregate on the nodes and coalesce...|$|E

40|$|The {{magnitude}} {{and extent of}} volatile organic emissions from hazardous waste land treatment systems were evaluated in laboratory and field studies using complex petroleum refining hazardous wastes. Laboratory experiments were conducted using two soils and a intert construction sand to investigate the emission flux rates of seven volatile constituents, i. e., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, p-, m-, o-xylene, and naphthalene, from API Separatory Sludge and <b>Slop</b> <b>Oil</b> Emulsion Solids wastes in column and flask laboratory units {{as a function of}} waste application rate, application method (surface versus subsurface), soil type and soil physical characteristics. Field experiemtns were conducted at an active petroleum refinery hazardous waste land treatment site to which a combined API Separator Sludge/DAF bottom sludge was surface applied. The emission rates of the sevel pure volatile constituents evaluated in the laboratory studies were quantified in the field study. Pure constituent collection and quantification in both laboratory and field studies were carried out using a surface isolation emission flux chamber and a split stream Tenax sorbent tube concentration system. Laboratory and field sampling train evaluation indicated that the system is best quited for high emission rate measurements, i. e., just following waste application, and requires diligent QA/QC procedures to minimize background contamination and to assure representativeness of measured data. Suggested operating procedures in terms of purge flow rates, split stream sampling rates, sample collection volumes for minimal contaminant sorbent tube breakthrough, etc., are presented. Measured laboratory and field data were comapred to the Thibodeaux-Hwang Air Emission Release Rate (AERR) model in an effort to validata this state-of-the-art land treatment air emission model. Data generally confirm the validity of the diffusion based on modeling approach for land treatment air emissions, especially for emission rates immediately following sruface waste application. Both field and laboratory surface application measured data correlated with Thibodeaux-Hwang AERR model predictions within a factor of two to ten. Laboratory subsurface application experiments were within one to two orders of magnitude of predicted values. The dynamics of the geometry of the subsurface contaminated zone following subsurface application, along with the hypothesis of concentration gradient development in the soil zone above the application plane, indicate that the simple diffusion based model does not adequately describe the unsteady-state diffusion process occurring following subsurface application events. The variability observed in point waste loading, and soil physical and temperature conditions observed during the field study suggest that detailed waste loading data (using a pan method described in the report) and site and time specific soil data are required for accurate correlations between measured and predicted waste constituent emission flux rates. Once specific data are collected which describe the physical environment of the land treatment system, the accurate prediction of pure constituent air emissions from surface application and tilling can be provided by the Thibodeaux-Hwang AERR model even for complex hazardous wastes applied to complex soil systems.

40|$|Effect of the blends of {{different}} polyethylenes (LDPE = low-density polyethylene,LLDPE = linear {{low density polyethylene}} and HDPE = high density polyethylene) and rubbers (PBR = polybutadiene rubber, SBR = styrene butadiene random copolymer, NR = natural rubber and SEBS = styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene block copolymer) on bitumen properties was investigated. PBR-PE Blends form a physical net-work in bitumen medium, whereas their SBR, NR and SEBS counterparts do not. The properties of the resulting bituminous blends are comparable with those of SEBS blends. LLDPE shows a higher rate of effectiveness on bitumen properties as compared with other polyethylenes. SBR Blends show a better elastic recovery and film forming proper-ties. Addition of heavy vacuum <b>slops</b> (HVS) <b>oil</b> into the ternary blends of rubber-PE-bitu-men results in rubber an increase in inclusions volume. The rubber swelling increases as HVS oil concentration increases. An increase in HVS Oil concentration could be adjust-ed depending on the designed performance grade (PG).
