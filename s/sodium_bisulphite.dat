40|$|Vast {{applications}} of peroxidases create an increasing demand to characterize peroxidasesfrom new sources with more applicability potential. The {{aim of the}} present study wasto check the presence of peroxidase activity from Caralluma umbellata. This is the first reporton the C. umbellata peroxidase (CUP). The presence of peroxidase was revealed by thehistochemical analysis of the stem sections, zymographic studies, and in vitro peroxidaseactivity assay using various reducing substrates viz., 2, 2 ′-azinobis (3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS), guaiacol, o-dianisidine, and ferulic acid. The band pattern in zymogramconfirms that CUP has a molecular weight less than that of horseradish peroxidase (44 kDa). Comparative evaluation of peroxidase activity of CUP with respect to horseradish peroxidase(HRP) indicates that CUP catalyzes ABTS and ferulic acid in a similar pattern as HRP but withguaiacol, the extent of catalysis shown by CUP over HRP is high. The standard inhibitorssodium azide and <b>sodium</b> meta <b>bisulphite</b> inhibited CUP activity in a dose dependent manner...|$|R

Data used {{in the design of the}} absorption section was that developed by Johnstone in 1938. This study showed that although the general form of his equation describes a method of calculation of the partial pressure, his data was on average 13 % lower than that found in this study. Examination of his original data did reveal that a typographical error might have occurred in his paper. Using his new equation would result in an increase in the calculated partial pressure of 26 % above that determined from his original equation. Given that Johnstone covered a range of conditions that would not be found in the design of a commercial FGD plant, data developed in this study has been used for all future designs...|$|R

50|$|Bisulfite {{sequencing}} {{relies on}} chemical conversion of unmethylated cytosines exclusively, {{such that they}} can be identified through standard DNA sequencing techniques. Sodium bisulfate and alkaline treatment does this by converting unmethylated cytosine residues into uracil while leaving methylated cytosine unaltered. Subsequent amplification and sequencing of untreated DNA and <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> treated DNA allows for methylated sites to be identified. Bisulfite sequencing, like the traditional restriction based methods, was historically limited to methylation patterns of specific gene loci, until whole genome sequencing technologies became available.

The effectivity of chemical preservatives used was influenced by their penetration into pineapple. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate penetration effectivity of <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> into pineapple in the presence of potassium sorbate and their influence to the product during storage. Prepared pineapples were soaked in solution (pH 3, 0) containing of 40 % w/v sucrose, with various concentrations of <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> (100 - 500 ppm) and potassium sorbate (0 - 1500 ppm) for 24 hours. The products were packed in vacuum plastic and stored in room temperature. The result showed that penetration of <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> into pineapple was greatly influenced by potassium sorbate concentration. On the other hand, penetration of potassium sorbate into pineapple was not significantly affected by <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> concentration. Combination of <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> (100 - 500 ppm) and potassium sorbate (0 and 500 ppm) could not prevent spoilage, as indicated by the swelling of vacuum plastic container.

40|$|Two simple. {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} spectrophotometric determination of menadione and its <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> derivative (MSB) {{have been carried}} out.

The second method proposes the reaction of menadione and its <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> derivative with resorcinol in concentrated sulphuric acid medium to give red coloured product having maximum absorption at 520 nm and is stable for 3 h.

40|$|The {{potential}} of insects {{as an alternative}} protein source for food applications was investigated by studying the effect of pH and NaCl on extraction yield of water-soluble proteins from Tenebrio molitor, while preventing browning due to polyphenol oxidation. Minimum protein solubility (29. 6 %) was at pH= 4 - 6 and maximum (68. 6 %) at pH= 11. Protein extraction at 0. 1 M NaCl, pH= 10 gave a recovery of 100 %. The observed increase in browning at pH= 8 - 11 corresponded to a lower monomeric phenol content. <b>Sodium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> (studied from 0. 5 - 4 %) could prevent browning, whereas ascorbic acid (studied in the range 0. 01 - 0. 04 %) could not prevent as strong as <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphite.</b> After acid precipitation (pH= 4) an isolate with a protein content of 74 % (yield of 22 % of total protein) was obtained.

40|$|M. Tech. RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is a {{gene silencing}} mechanism that uses short RNA duplexes to block gene expression. This mechanism {{has been widely}} explored to determine functions of genes. Furthermore, this phenomenon {{has been used to}} silence unwanted genes such as viral genes. RNAi has been successfully employed in non-mammalian organisms such as plants, where long dsRNAs (more than 30 bp) have been used without inducing non-specific effects. However, in mammalian cells, cytoplasmic dsRNAs of more than 30 bp trigger non-specific induction of many genes, which may result from the activation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and 2 ’, 5 ’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2 ’, 5 ’-OAS), via the interferon response pathway. In this study, we describe a novel and simple strategy to overcome nonspecific effects induced by longer RNA duplexes. This strategy uses <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> which is a mutagen that deaminates cytosine residue to uracil residues in order to introduce mutations in the sense strand of the duplex. Introduction of these mutations results in the formation of G:U pairings between the sense and antisense strands of the long hairpin RNA. RNA duplexes with mismatches {{have been shown to be}} able to prevent interferon induction in mammalian cells. According to the obtained results, long hairpins RNA with and without mismatches were unable to inhibit the expression of the target region, which was the U 5 region of the HIV- 1 subtype C LTR. The U 5 region of the LTR is actively involved in the reverse transcription of HIV- 1. Therefore silencing of this region would have led to the inhibition or reverse transcription blockage. Furthermore, data showed that the interferon response was induced when using these long hairpin RNA duplexes. Due to the sensitivity of mammalian cells, the action of <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> could have stimulated certain genes of the interferon pathway. Even though hairpins constructed in this study were unable to prevent the induction of the interferon response pathway and also could not silence the target, this strategy of using <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> has a great potential as shown by its ability to induce changes in cytosine residues and leaving other nucleotides unchanged...|$|E

The present study aimed to assess the recovery and formation of anthocyanins and their free phenolic acid degradation products during the commercial processing of blackcurrant juice concentrate. A bench-scale processing model was also established to allow for alteration of predefined parameters to identify where commercial processes could be modified to influence anthocyanin yield. No significant loss in anthocyanins was observed throughout the commercial processing of blackcurrants, from whole berry through milling, to pectin hydrolysis and <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> addition (P = 0. 7). No significant loss in anthocyanins was observed following the subsequent processing of pressed juice, through pasteurization, decantation, filtration, and concentration (P = 0. 9). Similarly, the bench-scale model showed no significant losses in anthocyanin content except during pasteurization (22 %± 0. 7 %, P < 0. 001). In the full-factorial Design of Experiment model analysis, only <b>sodium</b> <b>bisulphite</b> concentration had an impact on anthocyanin recovery, which resulted in an increase (23 % to 27 %; P < 0. 001) in final anthocyanin concentration.

Practical Application: This article provides crucial data directly applicable to commercial juice processing, such as improving anthocyanin yield and practical considerations for anthocyanin stability and degradation.
