40|$|The {{reliability}} and validity of three <b>short</b> <b>forms</b> of the Dutch version of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Fourth Edition (WMS-IV-NL) were evaluated in a mixed clinical sample of 235 patients. The <b>short</b> <b>forms</b> were based on the WMS-IV Flexible Approach, that is, a 3 -subtest combination (Older Adult Battery for Adults) and two 2 -subtest combinations (Logical Memory and Visual Reproduction and Logical Memory and Designs), which can be used to estimate the Immediate, Delayed, Auditory and Visual Memory Indices. All <b>short</b> <b>forms</b> showed good reliability coefficients. As expected, for adults (16 - 69 years old) the 3 -subtest <b>short</b> <b>form</b> was consistently more accurate (predictive accuracy ranged from 73 % to 100 %) than both 2 -subtest <b>short</b> <b>forms</b> (range = 61 %- 80 %). Furthermore, for older adults (65 - 90 years old), the predictive accuracy of the 2 -subtest <b>short</b> <b>form</b> ranged from 75 % to 100 %.

40|$|Aim. The {{present study}} aimed at {{examining}} the factorial {{structure of the}} Chinese version of the State Anxiety Scale (<b>Short</b> <b>form),</b> using exploratory and confirmatory analyses. Background. The factorial structure of the <b>short</b> <b>form</b> of the Chinese version of the State Anxiety Scale for Children has neither been examined by using exploratory factor analysis nor been examined by confirmatory factor analysis. Consequently, whether {{the factor structure of}} the <b>short</b> <b>form</b> is congruent with the hypothesised configuration of the factor structure of the full form cannot be confirmed. Design. Survey. Method. A test-retest, within-subjects design was employed. Two hundred children (7 - 12 years of age) admitted for surgery in a day surgery unit was {{invited to participate in the}} study. They were asked to respond to the Chinese version of the State Anxiety Scale (<b>short</b> <b>form)</b> before surgery and upon discharge home. Results. The results of exploratory factor analysis showed that there are two factors underlying the <b>short</b> <b>form,</b> which is congruent with hypothesised configuration of the factor structure of the full form. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the construct validity, with a good fit between the factor structure of the <b>short</b> <b>form</b> and the observed data. Conclusion. This study addressed a gap in the literature by examining the factorial structure of the <b>short</b> <b>form.</b> The results confirmed the factor structure of the <b>short</b> <b>form</b> is congruent with the hypothesised configuration of the factor structure of the full form. Relevance to clinical practice. The availability of a valid, reliable and convenient instrument is crucial in evaluating the effectiveness of nursing interventions. The findings also suggest that the <b>short</b> <b>form</b> is an objective assessment tool and can be used by clinical nurses as objective assessment tool in measuring anxiety level of Chinese children in busy clinical settings, where time constraints make the use of the full form unfeasible. © 2008 The Authors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{different}} Spanish dialects and {{in other}} romances languages {{it has been observed}} that the use of the <b>short</b> <b>form</b> of the adverb of manner (directo,rápido) is restricted to oral and informal registers, in contrast with the long form (directamente, rápidamente), which is preferred in writing and in formal registers. However, in Mexican Spanish, the use of the <b>short</b> <b>form</b> is more extended and it is not restricted to oral contexts. In this study we sought evidence of the use of adverbs in their <b>short</b> <b>form</b> in formal registers. To this end 15 adverbs were analyzed in their <b>short</b> <b>form</b> -adverbialzed adjectives-and long form -ending in mente- in two corpuses of different sociocommunicative registers of Mexican Spanish.

40|$|The {{valid and}} {{reliable}} Fitness-to-Drive Screening Measure© (FTDS) is a free online proxy measure that screens for at-risk older drivers using 54 driving-related items. This secondary data analysis aims to construct and validate a <b>short</b> <b>form</b> FTDS, using 200 caregiver FTDS response sets and 200 older driver on-road assessment pass/fail outcomes. To construct the <b>short</b> <b>form,</b> exploratory factor analysis and classical test theory techniques were employed to determine the most interpretable factor model and the minimum number of items that {{might be used to}} predict fitness to drive. Next, receiver operating characteristics curves were generated to evaluate the concurrent criterion validity of the constructed <b>short</b> <b>form</b> against driver on-road pass/fail outcomes.
