However, expression of the transgene was restricted to osteoblasts and osteocytes, as established by biochemical analysis of CAT activity and immunohistochemical analysis of CAT expression at the single cell level. Our data indicate that donor cells achieved long-term engraftment in various tissues of the recipients and that the CAT gene under control of the osteocalcin promoter is expressed specifically in bone.

Clinically, cytokine therapy has the potential of influencing disease outcome by altering the balance between proinflammatory versus immunosuppressive cytokine profiles. <b>Somatic</b> cytokine <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> is an attractive alternative to cytokine immunotherapy, because it eliminates the need for frequent protein injections, and generates more constant cytokine levels in vivo which may reduce toxicity and increase therapeutic efficacy. To study the immunoregulatory effects of TGF-beta 1 and IL- 4 in vivo, we used a novel method of i. m. cytokine <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> in 2 experimental models of Th 1 cell-mediated autoimmune diseases: murine diabetes and EAE. In our first model, i. m. TGF-beta 1 gene administration is effective at suppressing a DTH response, and at protecting NOD mice from autoimmune insulitis and diabetes. In this model, disease protection was associated with a decreased intrapancreatic IL- 12 and IFNgamma mRNA expression. In our second model, TGF-beta 1 and IL- 4 -IgG 1 <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> resulted in anti-encephalitogenic effects in mice with MBP-induced EAE. TGF-beta 1 gene delivery had pronounced downregulatory effects on MBP-stimulated T cell proliferation and production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha.

Here we report the possibility of conferring a permanent antiviral state to cells by introducing an IFN-beta gene with a modified transcriptional control. This was achieved by placing the murine IFN-beta-coding sequence behind the IFN-inducible 0. 6 -kb XhoII-NruI promoter region of the H- 2 Kb major histocompatibility complex gene. BALB/c 3 T 3 cells that are normally permissive for virus infection were transformed with this construction, and 14 of the 21 clonal cell lines obtained displayed different levels of enhanced resistance to the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, and Semliki Forest virus. The permanent antiviral state was dependent {{on the presence of}} new IFN-beta fragments in Southern blots and was accompanied by very low constitutive synthesis of IFN-beta, and the presence of construct-derived IFN mRNA could be demonstrated only after polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA. The antiviral state was stable over a 9 -month period in culture, corresponding to about 250 cell generations, and did not affect cell replication, since the average population doubling time of these cells was not significantly {{different from that of the}} control clone. Twenty-nine control clonal cell lines, stably transformed with either the neo gene alone (22 lines) or the neo gene together with a mutated murine IFN-beta gene coding for an inactive protein (7 lines), did not develop stable antiviral expression.
