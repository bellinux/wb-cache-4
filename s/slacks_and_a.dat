25|$|The kitchen area {{reflects}} {{the original design}} concept; it includes separate stations for baking and pastries and was never reduced when the original project was downsized. High quality kitchen appliances were installed so the hotel could compete with fine dining establishments, and the facility was specifically constructed to handle special events and functions. The wood beames {{in the dining room}} are actually hollow, with steel beams going through them for fire safety reasons. Every detail was carefully thought out. The alcove window {{at the end of the}} room perfectly framed Yosemite Falls when the hotel was completed. The dining room is 130 feet long and 51 feet wide, with a 34-foot ceiling supported with rock columns creating a cathedral like atmosphere. While the dress code for the park is usually very casual, the Ahwahnee Dining Room used to require a jacket for men, but it later relaxed that tradition. Now collared shirts for men are allowed and women may wear either a dress or <b>slacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> blouse.|$|E

I don't say the fellow's vicious, but he's <b>an</b> extravagant <b>slacker</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> fool, which is perhaps as bad. Anyhow, {{if he can}} be reformed at all, it's Sadie's business, and I've no doubt she finds it an arduous job. There's no use in <b>an</b> outsider meddling, <b>and</b> your anxiety for his improvement might be misunderstood. In fact, it has been seriously misunderstood." ...|$|R

His prosecutors, however, tried García Ábrego as an U.S. citizens because he also had an American birth certificate, although Mexican authorities claimed the certificate was [...] "fraudulent." [...] He also had an official birth certificate that claimed García Ábrego was indeed born in Mexico. According to The Brownsville Herald, García Ábrego went into the courtroom grinning and talking animatedly with his lawyers who helped him translate his words from Spanish into the English language. Hours after the judge told García Ábrego {{that he was going}} to spend the rest of his life in prison, the death penalty was out of the question for the prosecutors.|$|E

[...] <b>and</b> <b>a</b> daily invitation to join them in the ritual of martinis on the front porch at sunset. He was more likely to arrive unannounced and then madden the cook by staying for lunch or dinner.

6000|$|It {{was on a}} fine summer's {{day that}} a solitary {{traveller}} rode under the old-fashioned archway, and alighted in the court-yard of Meg Dods's inn, and delivered the bridle of his horse to the humpbacked postilion. [...] "Bring my saddle-bags," [...] he said, [...] "into the house--or stay--I am abler, I think, to carry them than you." [...] He then assisted the poor meagre groom to unbuckle the straps which secured the humble and now despised convenience, and meantime gave strict charges that his horse should be unbridled, <b>and</b> put into <b>a</b> clean <b>and</b> comfortable stall, the girths <b>slacked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> cloth cast over his loins; but that the saddle should not be removed until he himself came to see him dressed.|$|R

His one indulgence is food, and his enormous appetite is a recurring joke throughout the series.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes {{the concept}} of {{potential}} <b>slack</b> <b>and</b> show it is an effective metric of combinational circuit performance. We provide several methods for estimating potential <b>slack</b> <b>and</b> prove one (<b>a</b> maximal-independent-set based algorithm) in particular works best. Experiments in gate sizing show that potential slack provides 100 % correct prediction for circuit area optimization. We also explore the role of potential slack in timing-driven placement...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a class of}} convex optimization problems where both, the objective function and the constraints, have a continuously varying dependence on time. Our goal is to develop an algorithm to track the optimal solution as it continuously changes over time inside or on the boundary of the dynamic feasible set. We develop an interior point method that asymptotically succeeds in tracking this optimal point in nonstationary settings. The method utilizes a time varying constraint <b>slack</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> prediction-correction structure that relies on time derivatives of functions and constraints and Newton steps in the spatial domain. Error free tracking is guaranteed under customary assumptions on the optimization problems and time differentiability of objective and constraints. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated in a problem that involves multiple agents tracking multiple targets...|$|R
