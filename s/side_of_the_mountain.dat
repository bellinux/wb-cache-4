5|$|Roxy Ann Peak's {{southern}} foothills {{are also}} home to the RoxyAnn Winery, a Rogue Valley AVA winery founded in 2002.

5|$|Shorter and quicker {{routes to}} the top of Helvellyn, though with less {{attractive}} scenery, begin from several points along the A591 road along the west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> Two of these may be combined to create a circular walk.

5|$|Ferdinand reluctantly ordered saps to be {{dug into}} the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> The sapping was {{difficult}} and dangerous and the sappers worked under continuous attack from the castle's defenders, who fired on them with small arms and the castle's artillery and dropped rocks and debris on their heads. The forced labor of local peasants minimized losses among Ferdinand's own troops, {{but many of the}} peasants perished in the effort.|$|E
5|$|Several long trails {{pass through}} the Morrison Creek area on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> The Snipes Mountain Trail #11 follows {{the eastern edge of}} the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed from the lower end for 6 miles to the Round the Mountain Trail. The Cold Springs Trail #72 follows the western edge for 4 miles. Other trails in the area include the Gotchen Trail #40, Morrison Creek Trail #39, and Pineway Trail #71.|$|E
5|$|Several {{relatively}} young obvious lava flows {{exist in the}} area around Adams. Most of these flows are on the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> and include the flow in the Mutton Creek area, Devils Garden, the Takh Takh Meadows Flow, and the much larger Muddy Fork Lava Flow to the north of Devils Garden. Only one obvious flow appears on the south slopes of Adams, the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Other smaller flows exist in various locations around the mountain as well.|$|E

5|$|The south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> along Suksdorf Ridge is {{moderately}} glacier-free, {{with the}} only glaciers being the relatively small Gotchen Glacier and the Crescent Glacier. The south side, however, does have some perennial snowfields on its slopes. The Crescent Glacier {{is the source of}} Morrison Creek; and, although it does not feed it directly, the Gotchen Glacier is the source of Gotchen Creek. Both creeks drain to the White Salmon River.|$|E
5|$|While {{the slaves}} lacked {{military}} training, Spartacus' forces displayed ingenuity {{in their use}} of available local materials, and {{in their use of}} clever, unorthodox tactics when facing the disciplined Roman armies. In response to Glaber's siege, Spartacus' men made ropes and ladders from vines and trees growing on the slopes of Vesuvius and used them to rappel down the cliffs on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> opposite Glaber's forces. They moved around the base of Vesuvius, outflanked the army, and annihilated Glaber's men.|$|E
5|$|High Lakes Trail #116, the namesake of the Midway High Lakes Area, {{crosses the}} {{relatively}} flat {{area on the}} north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> following a trail the Yakama Native Americans used for picking huckleberries. Like many other trails around Adams, this trail has spectacular views of the mountain. Other trails, like the Takh Takh Meadows Trail #136, pass through picturesque meadows and old lava flows. One of the longest trails on the Gifford Pinchot, Boundary Trail #1, has its eastern terminus in the Midway High Lakes area at Council Lake. Other trails in the area include the Council Bluff Trail #117, Green Mountain Trail #110, and East Canyon Trail #265.|$|E

5|$|Three {{prominent}} ridges {{descend from}} the east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> The Ridge of Wonders is furthest south and ends at an area away from the mountain called The Island. Battlement Ridge is very rugged and descends from high on the mountain. The furthest ridge north on the east side, Victory Ridge, descends from a lower elevation on the mountain than Battlement Ridge beneath the precipitous Roosevelt Cliff. Lava Ridge, starting {{at about the same}} location as the North Cleaver, descends slightly east of north.|$|E
5|$|To the south, the White Salmon River has {{its source}} {{on the lower}} flanks of {{the west side of}} Adams and gains {{additional}} flows from streams along the southwest <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> Streams on the east side all flow to the Klickitat River. Streams on all sides, {{at some point in their}} courses, provide essential irrigation water for farming and ranching. The Klickitat and White Salmon rivers are nearly completely free flowing, with only small barriers to aid irrigation (White Salmon) and erosion control (Klickitat). The Cispus and Lewis rivers have been impounded with dams farther downstream for flood control and power generation purposes.|$|E
5|$|A route {{popular with}} {{experienced}} hillwalkers starts at Torlundy, {{a few miles}} north-east of Fort William on the A82 road, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a head for heights. In common with other approaches on this <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> it {{has the advantage of}} giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.|$|E

5|$|King Memorial Fountain is a {{fountain}} erected in 1893 with a monumental bronze statue of Moses smiting the rock for water on Mount Horeb. Four figures of Israelite slaves around the statue on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> represent the four stages of life: infancy, youth, adulthood, and old age. The fountain {{is in the}} center of formal gardens laid out by William S. Egerton. It was a gift from Rufus H. King and was sculpted by J. Massey Rhind, who also sculpted the Philip Schuyler statue that stands {{at the center of the}} intersection of Eagle Street and Washington Avenue in front of city hall. In 1988, the statue of Moses was cleaned and applied with a wax coating to protect it from the weather, and an arm was reattached to one of the four other statues on the fountain.|$|E
5|$|Between 1930 and 1936, Kolbe {{undertook}} {{a series of}} missions to East Asia. At first, he arrived in Shanghai, China, but failed to gather a following there. Next, he moved to Japan, where by 1931 he founded a monastery at the outskirts of Nagasaki (it later gained a novitiate and a seminary) and started publishing a Japanese edition of the Knight of the Immaculate (Seibo no Kishi). The monastery he founded remains prominent in the Roman Catholic Church in Japan. Kolbe built the monastery on a mountainside that, according to Shinto beliefs, was not the side best suited to be in harmony with nature. When the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, Kolbe's monastery was saved because the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> took the main force of the blast. In mid-1932 he left Japan for Malabar, India, where he founded another monastery; this one however closed after a while. Meanwhile, the monastery at Niepokalanów began in his absence to publish the daily newspaper, Mały Dziennik (The Little Daily), in alliance with the political group, the National Radical Camp (Obóz Narodowo Radykalny). This publication reached a circulation of 137,000, and nearly double that, 225,000, on weekends.|$|E
5|$|James F. Reed {{made it out}} of the Sierra Nevada to Rancho Johnson in late October. He {{was safe}} and {{recovering}} at Sutter's Fort, but each day he became more concerned for the fate of his family and friends. He pleaded with Colonel John C. Frémont to gather a team of men to cross the pass and help the company, in return for which Reed promised that he would join Frémont's forces and fight in the Mexican-American War. Reed was joined by McCutchen, who had been unable to return with Stanton, as well as some members of the Harlan-Young party. The Harlan-Young wagon train had arrived at Sutter's Fort on October 8, the last to make it over the Sierra Nevada that season. The party of roughly 30horses and a dozen men carried food supplies, and expected to find the Donner Party on the western <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> along the Bear River below the steep approach to Emigrant Gap, perhaps starving but alive. When they arrived in the river valley, they found only a pioneer couple, immigrants who had been separated from their company and were near starvation.|$|E
