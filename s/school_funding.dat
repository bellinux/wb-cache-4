5|$|At Horace Mann Elementary School in Seattle {{during the}} mid-1950s, Hendrix's habit of {{carrying}} a broom {{with him to}} emulate a guitar gained {{the attention of the}} school's social worker.

5|$|Corzine {{has been}} the only New Jersey {{governor}} in recent memory to make any headway in addressing the crisis of municipal funding. While not directly touching the third rail of New Jersey governance – property taxes – Corzine's reform of the <b>school</b> <b>funding</b> formula (passed and signed in January 2008) resulted in significant relief to many New Jersey towns with outsize school costs but limited tax base.

40|$|The {{study was}} to {{identify}} factors leading to low parental contribution to <b>school</b> <b>fund</b> in North “A” District- Zanzibar. Specifically, it was to find out if parental income affects parental contribution to <b>school</b> <b>fund.</b> To examine parental perception towards fees contribution whether affects their contribution to <b>school</b> <b>fund.</b> To find out if parental involvement in the school budgeting process affects parental contribution to <b>school</b> <b>fund,</b> and {{to find out if the}} announcement ‘free education’ policy (Elimu Bila malipo) affects parental contribution to <b>school</b> <b>fund.</b> The study was conducted in North ‘A’ District – Zanzibar, whereby eight governmental schools were involved in the study. The study adopted a survey research design, which employed both qualitative and quantitative techniques in data collection. The study revealed that, parental income affects parental contribution to <b>school</b> <b>fund.</b> The results showed that many parents either did not contribute all or contributed little because of their low income. The study also found that majority of parents was not satisfied with the system of contributing fees to schools though their dissatisfaction did not affect their contribution to <b>school</b> <b>fund.</b> Furthermore, the study found that parents were not involved in the school budgeting process, but this also does not affect their contributions to <b>school</b> <b>fund.</b> The study also found that, the announcement ‘education is free’ by the government did not cause low parental contribution to <b>school</b> <b>fund.</b> However, the study further found that some parents considered the school contribution as not compulsory, and therefore they were not obligated to contribute. The study recommended that government should provide support to parents to improve their economic activities, especially farming and fishing to increase their income. It also recommended that more education should be provided to reduce misconceptions towards fund contribution among many parents. ...|$|R
5|$|The Virginia Lottery is an {{independent}} agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia. It was created in 1987 when Virginians {{voted in favor of}} a state lottery. The first ticket was sold on September 20, 1988. All profits from Virginia Lottery ticket sales go to K-12 public education. In Fiscal Year 2017, the Lottery's profits totaled well over a half billion dollars, accounting for approximately 9 percent of <b>school</b> <b>funding</b> in Virginia.

5|$|As secretary, Zahorchak {{implemented}} {{state funding}} for pre-kindergarten and full-day kindergarten, training for principals, and easier ways to transfer college credits from one school to another. He has managed $200million in Accountability Block Grants {{that were used}} for tutoring, math and literacy coaching, and led the development of Pennsylvania Inspired Leadership, a legislative initiative to develop and support educational leaders in the state. In 2008, Rendell and Zahorchak unveiled the first new <b>school</b> <b>funding</b> formula in about two decades, which set out to more fair than previous formulas and better meet {{the specific needs of}} individual school districts. The formula would give more money to districts with large numbers of children living in poverty. Other factors considered under the formula were cost of living, district size, enrollment growth and the number of students learning to speak English. The formula originally called for increasing Pennsylvania education spending by $2.6billion over the next six years, starting with an additional $291million in 2008–09, although the final budget passed by the state reduced that expenditure to $274million.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1967, New York City mayor John Lindsay {{sought to}} develop closer ties {{with leaders of}} impoverished neighborhoods. Prompted in part by {{concerns}} voiced by the New York Police Department (NYPD), the mayor dispatched one of his aides, Barry Gottehrer, to meet with Clarence13X. Belying his fearsome reputation, Clarence13X had a congenial meeting with Gottehrer, during which he requested more bus routes and <b>school</b> <b>funding.</b> Clarence13X subsequently attended a meeting of black leaders at Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official residence. The city provided buses for Five Percenters to travel to a Long Island park, and {{with help from the}} National Urban League, obtained an abandoned storefront for use as a school. It became known as the Allah School in Mecca and aimed to prepare young people for college preparatory schools. Tensions soon formed between the Five Percenters and the school's overseers; Clarence13X desired more control over the curriculum and had difficulty finding qualified teachers. Police regularly visited the school to ensure that the students were not being radicalized. In 1975, Gottehrer chronicled his friendship with Clarence13X in The Mayor's Man. The book was well received by some Five Percenters, who republished portions of it after it went out of print. They have not reprinted the entire book, owing to a passage in which Gottehrer relates that Clarence13X offered to allow him to sleep with his teenage daughter.|$|E

25|$|In Ontario at present, the Catholic {{school system}} is fully funded {{in the same manner}} as public schools.
