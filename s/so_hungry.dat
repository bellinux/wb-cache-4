Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad. I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry and they know supper's ready, and when the people are eatin' the stuff they raise and livin' in the houses they build, I'll be there, too.|$|E
25|$|At {{the times}} of {{greatest}} hardship the internees were <b>so</b> <b>hungry</b> that they were reduced to eating snakes, rubber nuts (which {{were believed to be}} poisonous), snails and frogs, and rats, cats and dogs if they could be caught. On special occasions an extra ration would be introduced. In the British POW compounds 58 chickens were provided for 1,000 men for Christmas 1942; the next Christmas the women received a single turkey to share between 271 women and children. At Christmas 1944, their last in captivity, the internees received a single egg each.|$|E

500|$|To add to this, {{supplying}} {{the city had}} become increasingly difficult because of winter storms and the rise in rebel privateers. The British troops were <b>so</b> <b>hungry</b> that many were ready to desert {{as soon as they}} could. [...] Worse, scurvy and smallpox had broken out in the city. Washington's army faced similar problems with smallpox, as soldiers from rural communities were exposed to the disease. Washington moved infected troops to a separate hospital, the only option then available given the public stigma against inoculation.|$|E

[...] The day after the arrival of Holborne, a supply caravan containing food, 2,000 muskets and 40 barrels of gunpowder restocked the town.

6000|$|This was {{the first}} time that Toby had thought of breakfast, and the very mention of eating made him hungry.

I could eat anything, if I only had the chance." ...|$|R
2500|$|With the {{widespread}} destruction of harvests and food reserves, {{the majority of}} the population became desperate for food, including areas well established in food production. In 1996, it was reported that people in [...] "the so-called better-off parts of the country, were <b>so</b> <b>hungry</b> that they ate the maize cobs before the crop was fully developed." [...] This reduced expected production of an already ravaged harvest by 50%.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{widespread}} belief Laudrup joined arch-rivals Real Madrid in {{an attempt}} to [...] "get back" [...] at Cruyff, the decision was based on the fact Real Madrid had been struggling for a long period and were eager to return to supremacy, like Barcelona when he decided to join them. Laudrup said, [...] "People say I wanted to go to Real Madrid just to get revenge. I say revenge from what? I've had a perfect time; five fantastic years here [...] I went to Madrid because they were <b>so</b> <b>hungry</b> to win, and they had four or five players who went to the World Cup. I said this would be perfect; new coach, new players, and hungry to win." ...|$|E

[...] Being out on the right flank one day, just {{out of sight of}} the troops, I came upon a beautiful covey of grouse. [...] They were so tame I could almost knock them over with rocks, but while the contact thus established made me increasingly anxious for grouse for dinner that night, I could not hit them. [...] So finally, in spite of those orders and with growing appetite, I shot two of them and quickly secreted the evidence of my disobedience by rolling them up in the rain coat I carried on my saddle. [...] The right wing of the command was wildly excited by the shots. [...] The skirmishers thrown out on that side soon discovered my lonely presence and hustled me to Colonel Chambers with the news that no Indians were visible. [...] He very sternly asked. [...] ‘Mr. Strahorn, did you do that firing?" [...] Upon my answering, [...] "Yes sir," [...] he still more gruffly asked, [...] "At Indians, or what?" [...] "Not at Indians, Colonel, but at grouse," [...] I answered. [...] "I was <b>so</b> <b>hungry</b> for grouse that I just couldn’t help it, so I’m ready to pay the penalty. [...] What is it?’ [...] Be it remembered that I was in the Colonel’s mess, and he replied quietly on the side, ‘Well, it will make a damn sight of difference whether you got a grouse.’" ...|$|E
