40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we study}} the notions (strongly) soc-injective, (strong-ly) simple-injective and (<b>strongly)</b> mininjective modules <b>in</b> σ[M]. For any module N in σ[M], N is <b>strongly</b> mininjective <b>in</b> σ[M] if {{and only if}} it is <b>strongly</b> simple-injective <b>in</b> σ[M]. A module M is locally Noetherian {{if and only if}} every <b>strongly</b> simple-injective module <b>in</b> σ[M] is <b>strongly</b> soc-injective. We also {{characterize}} Noetherian QF-modules. 1...|$|R
30|$|We {{say that}} f(u,v) is <b>strongly</b> {{decreasing}} <b>in</b> the first argument and <b>strongly</b> increasing <b>in</b> the second argument {{if it is}} differentiable and has first partial derivative D_ 1 f negative and second partial derivative D_ 2 f positive in a considered set. The connection between the theory of monotone maps and the asymptotic behavior of Equation (4) follows {{from the fact that}} if f is <b>strongly</b> decreasing <b>in</b> the first argument and <b>strongly</b> increasing <b>in</b> the second argument, then the second iterate of a map associated with Equation (4) is a strongly competitive map on I× I.|$|R

5|$|Titanium {{tetrachloride}} (TiCl4), a colorless liquid, {{is important}} {{as an intermediate}} {{in the process of}} making TiO2 and is also used to produce the Ziegler–Natta catalyst. Titanium tetrachloride is also used to iridize glass and, because it fumes <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> moist air, it is used to make smoke screens.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{killer whales}} are not {{considered}} a threat to humans, {{but there have been}} cases of captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers at marine theme parks. Killer whales feature <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> the mythologies of indigenous cultures, with their reputation ranging from being the souls of humans to merciless killers.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{a variation of}} the transitivity problem for proximinality properties of subspaces and intersection properties of balls in Banach spaces. For instance, we prove that if Z⊆Y⊆X, where Z is a finite co-dimensional subspace of X which is <b>strongly</b> proximinal <b>in</b> Y and Y is an M-ideal in X, then Z is <b>strongly</b> proximinal <b>in</b> X. Towards this, we prove that a finite co-dimensional proximinal subspace Y of X is <b>strongly</b> proximinal <b>in</b> X if and only if Y⊥⊥ is <b>strongly</b> proximinal <b>in</b> X**. We also prove that in an abstract L 1 -space, the notions of strongly subdifferentiable points and quasi-polyhedral points coincide. We also give an example to show that M-ideals need not be ball proximinal. Moreover, we prove that in an L 1 -predual space, M-ideals are ball proximinal...|$|R

5|$|Ag2r had {{a meager}} 2011 season, {{managing}} only six victories. The pinnacle of the team's season {{was certainly the}} Giro d'Italia. John Gadret, one of the team's leaders, won the undulating 11th stage to Castelfidardo. Though he was outclassed by the race's truly elite riders, particularly so by Giro champion Alberto Contador, he finished the race in fourth place overall, easily the best final placing in a Grand Tour in the team's history. Hubert Dupont also rode very <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> this race, to 12th place overall and some high stage placings as well.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Riverina region, the {{majority}} of Wagga Wagga residents supported the federation of the Australian colonies, in large part due to the prospect of free trade across colonial borders. In 1898, a group of residents promoted Wagga Wagga for consideration as the site of the future national capital due to its location equidistant from Sydney and Melbourne and its ample water supply. Despite the bid's lack of success, in the 1899 referendum Wagga Wagga residents voted <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> favour of federation.|$|E

He was, however, beaten by the Mercedes-Benz of Manfred von Brauchitsch at the Avusrennen (the yearly race at the AVUS track). Von Brauchitsch drove a privately entered SSK with streamlined bodywork, and beat Caracciola's Alfa Romeo, which finished in second place. Caracciola was seen by the German crowd as having defected to the Italian team and was booed, while von Brauchitsch's all German victory drew mass support.|$|E

Comedy Central believes <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> creative freedom of expression; when unique and deeply insightful creative talents like those behind South Park are able to express themselves freely, we all benefit. However, the safety of our employees is our unquestioned numberone priority, and therefore we have decided to take these precautionary measures.|$|E
5|$|Epiphenomenalism is a {{doctrine}} first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley. It {{consists of the}} view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental states {{do not have any}} influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the physical world. This view has been defended most <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> recent times by Frank Jackson.|$|E

The game was released in Japan in February 2008, and has remained exclusive to the region. When released, it was critically acclaimed by both Japanese and Western journalists and sold <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> Japan. Western journalists drew positive comparisons with the Mana and Diablo series.|$|E
5|$|He was {{replaced}} by former player Billy Bonds. In Bonds' first full season, 1990–91, West Ham again secured promotion to Division One. Now back in the top flight, Bonds saw West Ham through {{one of their most}} controversial seasons. With the club planning to introduce a bond scheme, there was crowd unrest. West Ham finished last and were relegated back to Division Two after only one season. However, they rebounded <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> 1992–93. With Trevor Morley and Clive Allen scoring 40 goals, they guaranteed themselves second place {{on the last day of}} the season with a 2–0 home win against Cambridge United, and with it promotion to the Premier League.|$|E

The play contained a rape scene and references to promiscuity and homosexuality, and {{was destined to be}} controversial; the media discussion about its suitability added to Leigh's anxiety.

5|$|Meckiff had {{performed}} <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> his debut first-class season, ending with 27 wickets {{at an average}} of 23.66. He was the ninth-highest wicket-taker for the Australian summer and his average was superior to all eight bowlers who took more wickets. At season's end, he was rewarded with selection for Australia's non-Test tour of New Zealand in February and March 1957. The hosts had Test status at the time, but Australia refused to ratify games against their trans-Tasman neighbours as Test matches, citing the weakness of the New Zealand team.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Spirit Fruit Society lived {{according}} to the following basic principles: seek happiness through selflessness; follow one's conscience; take responsibility for one's actions—and develop {{an awareness of the}} consequences of one's actions on others; and accept whatever happens. Beilhart believed very <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> the individual's right to guide his own actions, and not be dictated to by others. While {{there was no mention of}} any kind of organization or hierarchy in any documents, as the leader, Beilhart likely made important decisions concerning the group. There is no record of any kind of internal conflict between members.|$|E

Judah came out <b>strongly</b> <b>in</b> the first round, landing {{numerous}} shots on Galvan. During the round, a bad cut opened near the top of Galvan's head. The referee called for a timeout to allow the doctor {{to take a look at}} the cut. Due to the severity of the cut, the fight was waved off. The cut was ruled to be caused by an accidental foul with an elbow and since the fight did not go past four rounds, the fight was ruled a no contest.|$|E
