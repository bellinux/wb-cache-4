In principle, the determination of appropriate asphalt performance characteristics {{must take into account}} the volume of traffic in each vehicle category, and the performance requirements of the friction course.

50|$|Uneven {{pressure}} {{can be caused}} by a variety of factors. First is the human factor: asymmetric application of the bolt preload, this can cause uneven pressure. Theoretically when the flanges are pressed, the sealing surfaces are absolutely parallel, in practice however, the centerline of a pipeline cannot be absolutely concentric, and tightening the bolts on the flange moment makes the flange a discontinuity. With asymmetric connections, the <b>seal</b> <b>surfaces</b> will be more or less deformed and the pressure reduced, the running load, prone to leakage. Third, the density of bolt arrangement has an obvious impact on the pressure distribution, the closer the bolts, the more uniform the pressure.|$|E

There are {{numerous}} methods available to repair compressor and turbine shafts when bearing journals, <b>seal</b> <b>surfaces</b> and other critical areas require resurfacing.

The detonation gun is a device that can deposit a variety of metallic and ceramic coating materials at supersonic velocities onto a work piece by controlled detonation of oxygen-acetylene gas mixtures. Coatings applied by this method are characterized by high bond strength, low porosity and high modulus of rupture. This paper describes the equipment used to apply D-Gun coatings and provides data on coating thicknesses used, surface finishes available and physical properties of some popular D-Gun coatings used in machinery repair.

40|$|Implementing ozone {{depleting}} chemicals (ODC) -free solvents into full-scale reusable {{solid rocket}} motor cleaning operations has presented problems {{due to the}} low vapor pressures of the solvents. Because of slow evaporation, solvent retention is a problem on porous substrates or on surfaces with irregular geometry, such as threaded boltholes, leak check ports, and nozzle backfill joints. The new solvents are being evaluated to replace 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane, which readily evaporates from these surfaces. Selection of the solvents to be evaluated on full-scale hardware was made based on results of subscale tests performed with flat surface coupons, which did not manifest the problem. Test efforts have been undertaken to address concerns with the slow-evaporating solvents.

This region has {{experienced}} some sort of rapid development – urbanization and industrialization since the 1980,s, and this gave rise to increase in impervious surface (IS) cover within the region. Impervious surfaces are mainly constructed surfaces- rooftops, sidewalks, roads, and parking lots- covered by impenetrable materials such as asphalt, concrete, brick, and stone. These materials <b>seal</b> <b>surfaces,</b> repel water and prevent precipitation from infiltrating soils. Increased impervious cover generally results in more storm water runoff and less ground water recharge. Less recharge means less ground water discharges to streams during dry periods. Also, impervious surfaces allow many types of pollutants, derived from a variety of sources, to accumulate upon them, and subsequently washed into water bodies by storm water runoff, severely degrading water quality (non-point source water pollution). Impervious surfaces can therefore be considered a direct indicator as to the quality of surrounding surface water including streams, rivers, and lakes. In order to curb the possibl...|$|E

Although their high stone content has reduced problems with permanent deformation they pose a problem when they become polished and don’t meet minimum requirements for safety. It {{may be possible to}} overlay with another thin surfacing, remove and recycle or re-texture. Each process has differing merits in terms of sustainability. This paper considers chip seal as an alternative method. Traditionally, chip seal has been viewed as being noisy and has not been considered for use in urban areas where noise {{is an important factor in}} the selection of a new surface. Research at University of Ulster in noise prediction highlighted that smaller stone size chip <b>seal</b> <b>surfaces</b> can achieve significant noise reduction so offering an additional alternative for resurfacing. A laboratory study of chip embedment has investigated change in texture depth and skid resistance for a range of chip sizes and asphalt mix types.

40|$|This paper {{details the}} results of {{analysis}} of chip <b>seal</b> <b>surfaces</b> in New Zealand and the USA using digital imaging techniques. Information theory permits the derivation of an objective metric of a digital image. A two-dimensional Fourier transform of an image allows computation {{of the volume of}} information contained in that image. The information content is governed by the amount of texture present in a chip seal. Thus, a road that is badly flushed will have measurably different information content than one that is in satisfactory condition. At the present time New Zealand utilizes the sand circle test to quantify existing surface texture. Even with experienced, skilled operators, the test takes some time to perform, and is normally done in live traffic conditions with varying levels of traffic control. Correlating the image information content with a sand circle measurement taken at the same spot promises to improve the method for evaluating the condition of chip sealed surfaces by enhancing the reproducibility of the test as well as greatly reducing the time that technicians are exposed to live traffic during data collection. Skid resistance is highly dependent on macrotexture.

40|$|The {{heat sealing}} {{behavior}} of novel polyethylene-based nanocomposite films was investigated, as they re-late to flexible packaging of fresh-cut vegetables, processed foods and biomedical devices. Appropriately designed sealant nanocomposites, which include dispersed montmorillonite nanofillers and ethyl vinyl ac-etate copolymer, produce a hermetic but peelable heat seal across a broad, 30 – 40 ◦C, range of heat sealing temperatures, outperforming optimized commercial polyethylene-based sealants that achieve peelable seals {{in a much}} narrower heat sealing temperature range, of less than 15 ◦C. Appropriate nanocomposite design leads to a general easy-open/peelable character of heat seals, which is: (a) independent of sealing conditions and apparatus — ranging from long dwell times at very high sealing pressures to very short heat impulses at very low sealing pressures; (b) markedly independent of {{the opposite side of}} the heat seal — for example, when sealed on itself, on unfilled sealant, or on high density polyethylene; and (c) rather insensitive to for-mulation variations of the sealant — for example, variations of the polyethylene of the ethyl vinyl acetate type and concentration, and of nanofiller loading. Insights from observations of the fracture <b>seal</b> <b>surfaces</b> by infrared spectroscopy and electron microscopy reveal that the underlying mechanism of this behavior is related to a synergistic effect of the ethyl vinyl acetate copolymer and the montmorillonite clay nanofiller...|$|E

The real level of flight loads encountered during airplane acceptance testing and revenue service and the engine's response in the dynamic flight environment were investigated. The feasibility of direct measurement of these flight loads and their effects by concurrent measurement of 747 /JT 9 D propulsion system aerodynamic and inertia loads and the critical engine clearance and performance changes during 747 flight and ground operations was evaluated. A number of technical options were examined in relation to the total estimated program cost to facilitate selection of the most cost effective option.

In most countries, authorities responsible for road safety {{do not have}} performance intervention criteria and standards, and rely on fixed-time interval maintenance programs. This practice is undergoing change via the introduction of mobile retroreflectivity recording units. The focus {{of this study is}} to investigate the use of standard mobile retroreflectivity recording units and to analyse the observed retroreflectivity data to evaluate the state of pavement markings under investigation. The centreline pavement marking retrorefl/ectivity data collected by Queensland Department of Main Roads using the ECODYN mobile retroreflectivity recording unit are analysed to determine how the factors such as pavement surface type and traffic environment relate to retroreflectivity performance. It has been found that the mobile retroreflectivity recording unit with in-built processing capabilities can be implemented for identifying the requirements of maintenance programs, as well as to relate the observed retroreflectivity with other factors such as pavement surface type and traffic environment. The observed data indicated that there is a disparity between urban and rural roads of southeast Queensland in terms of centreline pavement marking retroreflectivity qualities.

Thermally sprayed abradable seals {{have been used in}} the compressor section of jet engines since the late 1960 s. These seals are predominantly coatings made from composite material that derive their abradability from the use of low shear strength materials or form a porous, friable coating structure. Due to the extreme temperatures on the turbine side of gas turbine engines, brazed or welded metallic structures made from nickel (Ni) based alloys have typically been used to provide gas path sealing. When thermal shock resistant ceramics because available, oxide ceramic, mostly zirconia based high temperature abradable seals for the high pressure turbine stages were developed. For the highest temperature stages, thermally sprayed oxide ceramics with or without metallic strain isolators are frequently used. On stages with reduced temperatures both ceramic and metallic coatings of the McrA 1 Y type can be used.
