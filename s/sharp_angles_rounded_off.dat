50|$|A draketail is a Chesapeake Bay {{boat that}} {{features}} a sloping transom that meets the waterline at a <b>sharp</b> <b>angle,</b> usually <b>rounded</b> in plan. The feature {{could be found in}} 1920s workboats such as the Chesapeake Bay deadrise and in smaller skiffs. The configuration was inspired by World War I destroyer designs.|$|R
50|$|These {{are very}} {{particular}} stars, plump and pillow-shaped, {{more or less}} pentagonal. Their five arms have waned to only obtuse <b>angles</b> (and sometimes <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> or truncated). They can measure up to 30 cm in diameter, and are typical of Indo-Pacific coral reefs, where they feed on benthic invertebrates and coral.|$|R
2500|$|This {{version of}} the Batmobile is a simple sleek pod with <b>sharp</b> <b>angles</b> and <b>rounded</b> sides. Its {{interior}} is a red illuminated single-person cockpit, with computer circuitry and displays visible all around. It is armed with guided immobilizer missiles and grappling cables. Being a [...] "single-seat" [...] by design, it {{was never meant to}} carry two people, as shown when Terry's friend Maxine was once sitting behind the seat to great discomfort. According to Bruce, the vehicles top speed is Mach 3; however Terry has never piloted the vehicle at those speeds through Gotham City. It features a drop down hatch; this allows Terry swift exit/entrance from underneath without having to park the vehicle and get out, allowing him to literally get the drop on his opponents. Like Terry's batsuit the Batmobile features a camouflage system rendering it invisible; however another system consisting of holographic projector disguising it as a simple garbage dumpster or random car to keep away prying eyes and potential vandals. The vehicle has built in digital recorders and cameras for collecting audio and visual evidence.|$|R
60|$|Round {{the upper}} {{edge of the}} rock {{extended}} another massive wall, above which in picturesque outline rose the temple and other public edifices. At the foot of this natural citadel stretched the lower town, with its crowded population, its dense mass of houses, its temples and forum. The style of architecture was peculiar to the city. The Carthaginians abhorred straight lines, and all their buildings presented curves. The rooms were {{for the most part}} circular, semicircular, or oval, and all exterior as well as interior <b>angles</b> were <b>rounded</b> <b>off.</b> The material used in their construction was an artificial stone composed of pieces of rock cemented together with fine sand and lime, and as hard as natural conglomerate. The houses were surmounted by domes or cupolas. Their towers were always round, and throughout the city scarce an angle offended the eye of the populace.|$|R

30|$|The {{unaffected}} acetabulum {{followed the}} normal age-dependent development of <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> {{as reported by}} Ozçelik et al. [17], whereas the affected side remained steep at the 5 -year-follow-up. One previous study has measured the <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> in children with Perthes’ disease. Joseph showed that the <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> of Perthes’ hips in male, skeletally immature patients was higher compared to the unaffected side (44.7 ° vs. 42.9 °) [5]. Furthermore, he found {{a significant difference in}} the <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> between affected and unaffected hips in symptomatic adult patients with healed Perthes’ disease (40.1 ° and 36.1 °, respectively). These results are in accordance with our results, indicating that a steeper acetabulum is developed in Perthes’ hips during the course of the disease.|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of the robot {{practical}} working, the change of motion direction of trajectory is inevitable. When the direction changes dramatically, the <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> between adjacent trajectories, which can generate the vibration of robot, affects the service life of the robot. In order to deal with the <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> between adjacent trajectories, we propose a method which can deal with the <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> transferring by inserting transition arc, which is called position level, to solve the trajectory speed control problem. We analyze three basic analytic trajectories—space line, space arc, and space parabola—and present the formula for calculating the parameters of circular-arc-related parameters and propose the implementation process of algorithm of robot system. Through the simulation and experiment, this method can solve the <b>sharp</b> <b>angle</b> trajectory transfer problem effectively, increase the transfer speed dramatically, and reduce the vibration of robot’s mechanical structure...|$|R
60|$|As these bergs float southward {{with the}} currents, they melt very rapidly. The {{heat of the}} sun and the action of the waves {{gradually}} <b>round</b> <b>off</b> the <b>sharp</b> <b>angles</b> and topple down the spires that characterised them in the land of their birth. The process of dissolution, too, is carried on internally; for rain and melted water on the surface percolates through the mass, rendering it porous. As the waves cut away the base, the centre of gravity is thrown out, and the whole berg turns over with a terrible crash. Sometimes loud reports like cannon-shots are heard, and the huge mountain splits asunder; while, not unfrequently, the whole berg falls into a heap of chaotic ruins, and floats away in a mass of smaller pieces which disappear gradually in their parent sea.|$|R
30|$|To our knowledge, no {{previous}} study has associated <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> {{at an early stage}} of Perthes’ disease with the later shape of the femoral head. We found no significant associations between this parameter at the time of diagnosis and at the 1 -year follow-up with the modified three-group Stulberg classification at the 5 -year follow-up. Thus, <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> is of no prognostic value in Perthes’ disease.|$|R

50|$|A tri-oval is a shape which derives {{its name}} from the two other shapes it most resembles, a {{triangle}} and an oval. Rather than meeting at <b>sharp,</b> definable <b>angles</b> as the sides of a triangle do, in a tri-oval these <b>angles</b> are instead <b>rounded</b> into smooth curves.|$|R
30|$|A {{secondary}} change {{noted in}} patients treated with transphyseal screw fixation of the proximal femur was {{an improvement in}} acetabular geometry. <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> improved by 4.7 ° and the center edge angle improved by 5.8 °. The acetabular index was not measured in this study because it becomes increasingly difficult to measure as the triradiate cartilage closes when patients become skeletally mature. Meanwhile, <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> references landmarks present through development, and it shows little variation with pelvic tilt and pelvic rotation [15]. Furthermore, prior studies report good inter- and intra-rater reliability for <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> and center edge angle of Wiberg [20]. While the mean changes in <b>Sharp’s</b> <b>angle</b> and the CE angle were small, in some children the improvement was remarkable. In reviewing and measuring many radiographs, {{it appears that the}} central third of the proximal femoral physis is relatively straight, while the superior and inferior margins droop. This central third of the physis corresponds to the roundest part of the femoral head, which could be a stimulus for acetabular improvement. However, this is difficult to document but deserves further investigation.|$|R
