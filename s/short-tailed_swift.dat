50|$|The <b>short-tailed</b> <b>swift</b> (Chaetura brachyura) is {{a bird in}} the Apodidae, or swift family.|$|E
50|$|The <b>short-tailed</b> <b>swift</b> {{is about}} 10.5 cm long, and weighs 20 g. It has long narrow wings, a robust {{body and a}} short tail. The sexes are similar. It is mainly black with a pale rump and tail. It can be {{distinguished}} from related species in its range, such as the band-rumped swift (C. spinicauda) or the gray-rumped swift (C. cinereiventris) {{by the lack of}} contrast between the rump and the tail, the latter being much darker in the other species.|$|E
50|$|Gasparillo is {{actually}} {{made up of}} two islands separated by several metres of rocks. However the second island is very small and is not independently named. The main island a little over 200 metres in length but is very narrow, less than 50 metres at its widest point, approximately 8,000 m2 in area. It is, as with most islands around the Paria Peninsular, covered with dry forest vegetation, and composed of a limestone bedrock with caves. Several species of birds nest at the island, including the <b>short-tailed</b> <b>swift</b> that nest {{on the eastern side}} of the island.|$|E
2500|$|When {{he first}} {{described}} the chimney swift in 1758, Carl Linnaeus named it , believing {{it to be}} a swallow. This misconception continued well into the 1800s, with ornithologists calling it [...] "American Swallow" [...] (e.g. Mark Catesby) or [...] "Chimney Swallow" [...] (e.g. John James Audubon). In 1825, James Francis Stephens moved this and other small, <b>short-tailed</b> New World <b>swifts</b> to the genus Chaetura, where it has since remained, although some authorities in the 1800s assigned it to a variety of now obsolete genera. It has no subspecies. The chimney swift's closest relative is the Vaux's swift. Scientists believe that the two species evolved from a common ancestor that was forced to North America's southeastern and southwestern corners by glacial advances. Separated for millennia by vast ice sheets, the survivors evolved into two species which are still separated by a wide gap across the continent's midsection. It is also closely related to the Chapman's swift; in the past, the three were sometimes treated as a single species.|$|R
