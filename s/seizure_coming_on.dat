50|$|The {{ramifications of}} the {{procedure}} are questioned by the NPS's staff psychiatrist, Janet Ross, and later by her former teacher, an emeritus professor named Manon, at the lecture about the surgery. Manon raises concerns that Benson is psychotic (pointing to Benson's belief that machines are in hostile competition against humans and that machines will ultimately take over the world) and notes that the crimes he commits during the blackouts will not be curtailed. Ellis admits that {{what they are doing}} is not a cure, simply a way to stimulate the brain when the computer senses a <b>seizure</b> <b>coming</b> <b>on.</b> It would prevent a seizure but not cure his personality disorder. Ellis rationalizes his approach by pointing out that he is not convinced that not operating on Benson will do him any favors; Benson's condition threatens his life and those of others, has already undermined his legal status three times, and is worsening. Despite the concerns voiced, the team decides {{to go ahead with the}} operation.|$|E
