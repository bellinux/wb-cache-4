Graves, M.A., (then) the curate, which--as admirably suitable, and as having made a profound impression at the time, the bowed head and reverent look of the venerable Poet as he joined in it remaining 'pleasures of memory' still--it is deemed expedient to preserve permanently. I derive it from the same source as the full Speech itself, and give the context: 'Mr. Wordsworth then descended a step-ladder to the foundation-stone, and deposited the bottle in the cavity, which {{was covered with a}} brass plate, having inscribed on it the name of the founder, date, &c. Being furnished with a trowel and mortar by the master mason, Mr. John Holme, he spread it; another massy stone was then let down upon the first, and adjusted to its position, Mr. Wordsworth handling the rule, plumb-line, and mallet, and patting the stone he retired. The Rev. R.P. Graves next offered up the following prayer for the welfare and success of the undertaking: [...] "The foundation-stone of the new parochial school-house of Bowness being now laid, it remains that, as your minister, I should invoke upon the work that blessing of God, without which no human undertaking can prosper,--O Lord God, Who dwellest on high, Whose throne is the Heaven of heavens, and Who yet deignest to look down with goodness and mercy on Thy children of earth, look down, we beseech Thee, with favour upon us who now implore Thy gracious benediction on the work which is before Thee. The building which Thou hast put into the heart of Thy servant to erect grant that, as it is happily begun, it may be successfully completed, and that it may become a fountain-head of blessing to this place and neighbourhood. Thou hast directed us, O Lord, to bring up our children in Thy nurture and admonition; bless, we pray Thee, this effort to secure the constant fulfilment of so important a duty, one so entirely bound up with our own and our children's welfare. Grant that here, from age to age, the youth of these hamlets may receive such faithful instruction as may fit them for usefulness in this life, and for happiness in the next. Grant that the one school may send out numbers endued with such principles and knowledge as may make them, in their several callings, industrious, upright, useful men; in <b>society,</b> <b>peaceful</b> neighbours, contented citizens, loyal subjects; in their families, affectionate sons, and husbands, and fathers; in the Church, dutiful members of that pure and Scriptural Establishment with which Thou hast blessed our Land; and, as crowning and including all, resolved and pious followers of our Redeemer Christ. Grant too, O Lord, that the females which shall be educated in the other school shall receive there such valuable principles and such convenient knowledge as may fit them to make happy the homes of such men; that, with Thy blessing on their instruction, they may become obedient and dutiful children, modest and virtuous women, faithful and affectionate wives and mothers, pious and unassuming Christians; so that with regard to both it may be widely and gratefully owned that here was sown the good seed which shall have borne fruit abundantly in all the relations of life, and which at the great day of harvest hereafter shall, according to Thy word, be gathered into Thy garner. Such, O Lord God, Thou knowest to be the good objects contemplated by the original founders of the school, and the promotion of which {{is at the heart of}} him whose benefaction we have this day seen auspiciously begun. Trusting, therefore, O Lord, with full assurance that Thou dost favourably allow and regard these pious designs, I now undertake, as God's minister, and in His name, to bless and dedicate for ever this spot of ground, and the building which, with the Divine permission, will be here erected, and of which this is the foundation-stone, to the sound and religious training up of youth from generation to generation, to the continued grateful remembrance of the pious benefactor, and to the everlasting glory of God Most High, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And let all the people say, Amen."' ...|$|E
50|$|The first {{sentence}} labels the action {{as one of}} civil disobedience, thereby seeking to legitimize it. The second sentence avoids the ideologically charged notion of “non-violence”, a notion that the left-radical parts of the alliance would not have accepted, by announcing a less strong “non-escalation”. At the same time its purpose is {{to make clear that}} the alliance will not attack the police. The third sentence further specifies the action of civil disobedience as consisting of people. This can be read as a strong hint towards the left-radical supporters of the alliance who - at other times - engaged in street-fighting and the setting up of barricades as material non-human blockades. The last sentence sought to prevent the separation into “bad” (autonomous, violent) and “good” (civil <b>society,</b> <b>peaceful)</b> protestors that were often and most notably put forward by conservative politicians and the German intelligence services. The last sentence, the solidarization with all people who protested against the Nazi-march also sought to establish “Dresden Nazifrei” as a project that presented all currents of the political left.|$|E
5000|$|Only a {{day after}} the {{government}} promise on media that they would rein in the activities of ASWJ, the banned outfit announced rallies on 5 February 2015 to support the Kashmir cause. Such rallies were not only against government promises but all the statutory laws of the land including Anti Terrorism Act, Protection of Pakistan Act and National Action Plan drafted and approved after APS attack. Getting news of the planned rallies by ASWJ, the civil society responded swiftly by announcing another sit-in outside CM house if the banned outfit was allowed to hold rallies. ASWJ not only took out rallies on the same day but also managed to enter the red-zone and hold their own sit-in there with police, rangers and other law enforcement agencies kept watching this blatant violation of the law under their own nose. As announced in press club, Khurram Zaki, Jibran Nasir, Noor e Maryam and other civil society activists reached CM from the other side (Karachi Club side) and started their protest against banned outfit and Sindh administration for not keeping up their promises. On the other side of CM House ASWJ was doing their own protest against Civil Society and Khurram Zaki. Police officials and district administration preferred to crack down on Civil Society activists instead of ASWJ and around 25 were arrested immediately for entering red zone including Khurram Zaki. These 25 were only released after huge masses and protestors started converging on police station demanding their immediate release. The episode of the arrest of civil <b>society</b> <b>peaceful</b> activists again showed and exposed the vulnerability and weakness of civil government and infrastructure in front of these banned [...] "jihadi" [...] outfits. Police couldn't arrest even one of the ASWJ terrorist from other side of the CM house.|$|E
50|$|Mangyans {{lived in}} <b>peaceful</b> <b>societies</b> as {{compared}} to the head hunting tribes of North Luzon and the brave defiant warrior tribes of the South. Social scientists theorized that some <b>societies</b> become <b>peaceful</b> because their system of norms and values reward peaceful behavior but disapprove aggressive and impulsive behaviors. <b>Peaceful</b> <b>societies</b> are characterized by egalitarian social organization without status competition between men and without asymmetric relationship between men and women. Another theory posited that populations adapt, therefore, offering a more logical explanation why Mangyans preferred to retreat in the hinterlands. They accept peaceful submissiveness when they encounter lowland settlers, missionaries, traders and government officials.|$|R

Charlotte Perkins Gilman used her fiction to supplement, or "flesh-out," her theories on the necessity for women's economic independence and emancipation from household work. Women's place, she believed, was alongside men in making <b>society</b> <b>peaceful,</b> productive, and egalitarian. All domestic work would thereon be performed as a professionalized, commercialized service. This move would give both dignity to these laborious chores, and provide incomes for women who were previously dependent on their male family members.

Thoughtful architecture and urban planning would create not only the stage for this new society, but the society itself...|$|E

According to some researchers a democratization process cannot happen without having {{an independent state}} with {{control over their own}} territories. The Kurdish people without a given state are divided between four authoritarian states in the Middle east and in opposite to its neighbors' have Kurds ambition to become democratic always existed. The purpose pf this thesis was to analyze if Iraqi Kurdistan is heading towards democracy and to find what the driving factors behind the democratization process are. The thesis used a qualitative text analysis approach with a complementary case study where the thesis focused on Larry Diamonds internal and external factors as a guiding instrument to determine what political mechanisms have driven Kurds and politicians' transition to democracy and peace. The analysis presented that authoritarian division, authoritarian development, free values, civil <b>society,</b> <b>peaceful</b> pressure and limits of sanctions and aid conditionally drove them. For answering the research problem, is a democratization processes possible for non-independent states? It is possible, Kurds in Iraq have so far accomplished to establish an electoral democracy, and a consolidated democracy is not impossible if legitimacy among politicians are increased and if freedom of expression is uncontrolled by politicians and if corruption decreases...|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} and grounding of sustainable African democracies require the self-conscious identification {{and application of}} the principles underlying historical political ideas and practices of broad inclusion, multiple levels and institutions of participation, multiple layers of consultation, consensus building and common agreement and their application in the contemporary Africa. Conventional Western style approaches to democracy and peace building have produced neither sustainable peace nor sustainable democracy in Africa. This {{is because of the}} assumptions that the principal challenges to democratization in Africa are structural and intellectual, and that proper ‘education’, including the transmission of democratic values, and new institutions will provide a solid basis for a <b>society’s</b> <b>peaceful,</b> democratic transformation. These have proven inoperative. Yet, successful ‘peace making’ and ‘peace building’ has been achieved through home-grown actions and protocols (at the regional level via ECOWAS, SADCC, EAC etc., as well as continent-wide via the AU) borne out of recognition that security, peace, security and stability is essential for sustained democracy, economic growth and development.|$|R
