40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{materials of}} a rich dwelling dated back to the mid of the 14 th century. This complex is the first object which may be connected with {{the conflict between the}} Italians and the authorities of the Golden Horde in autumn, 1343. A great bulk of grain and many bags of flour as well as the richness of finds made it possible to presume that the dwelling belonged to a grain dealer. The ceramic finds from the dwelling precisely enough reflect the most essential features of Azak ceramic complex of that period. Among the main directions of its variation are decreasing of a portion of polished and ornamented ceramics made in the Golden Horde centers and replacement of the Byzantine slip ceramics by the production of towns of the Southeastern Crimea. The peculiarities of this particular period are the regularity of finds of Khorezm stamped ceramics, a significant amount of vessels of Majar manufacture, and some series of <b>slip</b> <b>bowls</b> of the East Crimean manufacture distinguished by the style of their decoration...|$|R

25|$|Smith's <b>bowling</b> <b>slipped</b> below 100 wickets in the 1938 season, but the 92 {{that he took}} {{included}} a return of eight wickets for 40 runs in the match against Gloucestershire and these were the best figures of his career.

2500|$|The most {{contentious}} {{decision of the}} series was when Don Bradman was not given out {{when he was on}} 28 in the First Test. Bradman was returning to bat after the war and a serious illness had struggled for an hour even on a good batting strip. Australia were 72/2 when Bill Voce bowled a ball that [...] "flew from the blade of the bat to Ikin". [...] Clif Cary was watching Bradman with Zeiss glasses while commentating on the radio and reported [...] "The next ball from Voce rises as it goes away and Bradman is out...Bradman out, caught Ikin at second <b>slip,</b> <b>bowled</b> by Voce, for 28". Ikin made the mistake of not appealing immediately as it was assumed that a batsmen will walk when he is so obviously out, but [...] "Bradman stood there as if he had never hit the ball" [...] "The fieldsmen stared as Bradman stood his ground, then appealed for a catch. In believing that he had jammed the ball on to the ground before it rose, Don was in a minority of the nearest witnesses on the field but that minority included the umpire". As one player said afterwards [...] "cricket is coming to a pretty pass if a side has to appeal for everything; when that happens it will mean the end of all those things for which cricket is supposed to stand".|$|R

5|$|Soon after {{reaching}} his century during the afternoon, Compton edged to the <b>slips</b> from the <b>bowling</b> of Miller, but Johnson spilled the catch. Compton {{went on to}} make 184 and England were eventually out for 441 on the final day. Johnson sent down 42 overs for a return of 1/66. He had the best economy rate of 1.57 runs per over, ahead of Toshack's 1.81; Bradman used both in a defensive manner. This left Australia a target of 98, which they reached with eight wickets to spare.|$|R
500|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on an ideal batting pitch that was {{predicted}} to be unhelpful for fast bowling. Thirty minutes before tea, England brought up their 150 without loss, and continued unhindered after two brief interruptions due to rain. Up to this point, the Australian bowling had been loose and inaccurate. Bradman brought on Johnson, who had delivered only three overs so far, {{the rest of}} the proceedings having been through fast bowlers. Seeking to stem the flow of runs, Bradman gave Johnson a ring field with no <b>slip.</b> Johnson <b>bowled</b> two consecutive maidens, but Washbrook was scoring freely at the other end, so Bradman called for the new ball and brought back the fast bowlers. Johnson was still wicketless when England closed the day at 2/268. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton accused Australia of going [...] "progressively downhill" [...] and regarded their performance as their worst day of bowling since World War II, citing the proliferation of full tosses.|$|R
5000|$|Bradman {{had only}} made 28, {{when he played}} Bill Voce into the slips. Jack Ikin caught the ball and threw it {{high in the air}} in joy. He had caught the great Bradman, and Australia, he thought, were three down for under a hundred on a good wicket. That was how it looked to Ikin, to some of the other English players and some of the crowd, and that was how it looked to me sitting {{watching}} from the dressing room. Bradman, however, thought it was a bump ball and he stayed, as he was fully entitled to do if there was any doubt in his mind...the umpire gave him not out and he went on to make 187 of Australia's total of 645.:Keith MillerThe most contentious decision of the series was when Don Bradman was not given out when he was on 28 in the First Test.

5|$|Although Harvey {{started as}} a wicketkeeper at school, he became a highly {{regarded}} cover fielder and later in his international career became an agile <b>slips</b> catcher. He <b>bowled</b> off spin from a three to four pace approach on rare occasions, taking only three wickets in his Test career. Away from the field, Harvey had a quiet and unassuming manner, in complete contrast to his dynamic batting, and his non-smoking, non-drinking set him apart from the prevailing cricket culture of his period. Harvey {{was known for his}} respect for umpiring decisions and for never appealing for leg before wicket when he fielded in the slips.|$|R
50|$|Pottery Mound {{is named}} after {{the large number of}} {{potsherds}} lying on the site surface, and after its low mound of melted adobe. The site was part of the Rio Grande Glaze Ware tradition that began ca. 1315 and continued until the time of the Spanish reconquest of New Mexico in 1693. The site's signature pottery, Pottery Mound Polychrome, includes red and black paint on a background consisting of two <b>slip</b> colors (on <b>bowls,</b> one <b>slip</b> color on the inside and the other on the outside). As is typical {{in the southern part of}} the glaze ware production area, Glaze A pottery (simple rim forms) predominates (Franklin 2007).|$|R

500|$|The tale was {{the basis}} for a story in The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales by Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith, wherein the prince decides to <b>slip</b> a <b>bowling</b> ball {{underneath}} one hundred mattresses after three years of unsuccessful attempts with the pea. In the morning, the princess comes downstairs and tells the queen, [...] "This might sound odd, but I think you need another mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a lump as big as a bowling ball." [...] which satisfies the king and the queen. The princess gets married to the prince, and they live happily, though maybe not completely honestly, ever after. American poet Jane Shore published a poem, [...] "The Princess and the Pea", in the January 1973 issue of Poetry, in which a close dependency between princess and pea is posited: [...] "I lie in my skin as in an ugly coat: / my body owned by the citizens / who ache and turn whenever I turn / on the pea on which so much depends" [...] (13-16). Russian writer Evgeny Shvarts incorporates the story, with two other Andersen stories, in his Naked King.|$|R
25|$|The line a bowler {{chooses to}} bowl {{will depend on}} several factors: the {{movement}} he is generating on the ball, the shots the batsman is able to play, and the field the captain has set. The two most common tactics are to either bowl directly at the stumps, or to bowl 3 inches to 6 inches outside the line of off stump. Bowling at the stumps is an attacking tactic {{with the intention of}} dismissing the batsman bowled or lbw. It can also be used as a defensive tactic, as the batsman will feel less able to play risky shots knowing that he will be dismissed should he miss the ball. Bowling outside off stump is known as the corridor of uncertainty. When done well, this line may confuse the batsman into whether to defend the ball or leave it, and may tempt him to play away from his body with his head not in line with the ball. The main aim of this tactic is to dismiss the batman caught by the wicketkeeper or in the <b>slips.</b> Other <b>bowling</b> variations, such as bowling wide of off stump or bowling at leg stump are generally seen as negative and defensive tactics.|$|R
2500|$|He was {{a member}} of both the 1900 and 1906 West Indies touring sides. He was second in the West Indies batting averages in 1900 and third in 1906 so was {{regarded}} as one of the successes of these tours. In 1900 he scored the first century by a West Indian in England when he made 113 against the Gentlemen of the M.C.C., described by Wisden as [...] "a dashing and faultless display". Before the 1906 tour he was described as [...] "an excellent bat; considered to be Austin's rival, but his strokes lack the finish of Austin's" [...] and [...] "another of the brigade who proved himself very strong on the left side and can bat with power. He fields in the <b>slips</b> and can <b>bowl</b> right arm medium pace if required".|$|R
5000|$|Also in {{the book}} are [...] "The Princess and the Bowling Ball", [...] "The Other Frog Prince", [...] "The Really Ugly Duckling", [...] "Cinderumplestiltskin" [...] and [...] "The Tortoise and the Hair". In the first, a retelling of The Princess and the Pea, the Prince finally finds a girl he really loves. Sick of his parents rejecting {{potential}} wives when they don't feel a pea under one hundred mattresses, he <b>slips</b> his <b>bowling</b> ball under her mattresses when his parents have her over. In [...] "The Other Frog Prince", the frog tells the princess that he will turn into a prince if she kisses him and so she does; he then says [...] "I was just kidding," [...] and hops back in the lake. [...] "The Really Ugly Duckling" [...] (a parody of Hans Christian Andersen's The Ugly Duckling), grows {{up to be a}} Really Ugly Duck, rather than a swan. [...] "Cinderumplestiltskin" [...] combines Cinderella and Rumplestiltskin. In [...] "The Tortoise and the Hair", a re-telling of The Tortoise and the Hare, the Hare says he can grow his hair (one {{on the top of his}} head) faster than the Tortoise can run. So they race, and race, and race, and race; this story has no ending, the last words of it being [...] "not the end".|$|R

50|$|In England's first innings, Johnson {{shared the}} new ball with Ryan Harris, but went wicketless {{in his first}} spell. He was {{introduced}} into the attack after the dismissal of Alastair Cook when Jonathan Trott arrived at the crease. Johnson's first delivery to Trott was a short ball that struck Trott on the gloves. In the first ball of his next over, the last over before lunch, Johnson dismissed Trott off another short ball as Trott edged {{the ball to the}} wicket-keeper. In the second session, Johnson continued bowling short and had Michael Carberry caught in the <b>slips</b> for 40, <b>bowling</b> around the wicket. He struck in his next over as Joe Root edged a full delivery to third slip. Johnson took another wicket in his following over, as Graeme Swann inside-edged a length ball to short leg, and England had collapsed from 2/82 to 8/91. England were bowled out for 138 with Johnson finishing with the best figures among Australian bowlers (4 for 64).|$|R
50|$|The second day's was {{watched by}} a record Adelaide Oval crowd of 50,962. Before play began, Paynter had been shaken when, {{en route to}} the cricket ground, an assailant knocked him to the floor before running away. Nevertheless, he and Verity resumed their {{overnight}} partnership and batted until lunch. Paynter frequently stretched forward to smother the spin bowling of O'Reilly and was not troubled by Grimmett. He was able to score by hitting the ball into the covers, while Verity concentrated on defence apart from a drive through point off Ironmonger. Both men looked to take quick runs as the fielders moved in to gather the ball. The only dangers came when Paynter slipped and Fingleton missed a chance to run him out when his throw missed the stumps, and Verity edged the ball past O'Reilly, standing too close at <b>slip,</b> from the <b>bowling</b> of Ironmonger. By the first interval of the day, the overnight batsmen had added 79 in the morning session, taking the total to 7/315.|$|R
5|$|Soon after, Compton edged to the <b>slips</b> {{from the}} <b>bowling</b> of Miller, but Johnson spilled the catch. Hardstaff fell for 43, lofting Toshack to Hassett {{on the leg}} side, having put on 93 with Compton. The ball looped {{up in the air}} and {{travelled}} half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through the fog. Barnett came in and together with Compton added 21 runs in 33 minutes before edging Johnston to Miller, who completed a difficult catch in slips. Yardley came out to bat at 264/5 and Compton drove Miller square for four, provoking the bowler's first bouncer of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and Miller's next delivery slipped out of his hand and cleared Compton's head on the full to some jeering in the crowd. Such a ball is known as a beamer and is illegal because of the physical danger it poses to the batsman. Compton and Yardley put on a 57-run partnership in 66 minutes before Johnston held a return catch to dismiss Yardley for 22. England reached stumps at 345/6, just one run ahead of Australia, with Compton on 154 and Evans on 10. During the day, Johnston bowled the most overs, 30.|$|R
5|$|Loxton came in {{with the}} score at 265/5 and {{accompanied}} Morris for 39 further runs before he fell to the new ball. He appeared uncomfortable with the outswingers and leg cutters of Bedser, and was beaten several times, before Edrich had him caught behind for 15. Lindwall came in and attacked immediately, scoring two fours before falling for nine. He played a cover drive from the bowling of Young, but hit the ball too early and thus launched it into the air, and it was caught by Edrich at cover point to leave the score at 332/7. Morris was then finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for its numerous hooks and off-drives. It took a run out to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run to third man after being called through from the non-striker's end by Tallon, but was too slow for the substitute fielder Reg Simpson's arm. Tallon, who scored 31, put on another 30 runs with Ring, before both were out with Australia's score on 389, ending the tourists' innings. Both were caught by Crapp in <b>slips</b> from the <b>bowling</b> of Hollies and Bedser respectively. Morris had scored {{more than half the}} runs {{as the rest of the}} team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. England had relied heavily on spin bowling; Young took 2/118 and of the 158.2 overs bowled, 107 were delivered by the two slow men. Hollies pitched the ball up repeatedly, coaxing the Australians into playing front-foot shots from balls that spun after pitching on off stump.|$|R
25|$|Bill Lawry (52) and Bobby Simpson (38) {{weathered}} the early storm of Fred Trueman and Brian Statham, edging a few through the <b>slips</b> and Trueman <b>bowling</b> out-swingers which moved {{just past the}} edge of the bat. Len Coldwell (2/58) came on the bowl his in-swingers, off which the openers managed to steal a few singles, until he managed to move the ball the other way and caught the edge of Simpson's bat for a catch behind at 62/1. Norm O'Neill came in until lunch when Australia went in on 93/1 off 22 overs in two hours, a total somewhat less than 15 overs an hour promised by Ted Dexter {{at the start of the}} tour. After lunch Lawry edged a ball from Statham between the wicket-keeper Alan Smith and Tom Graveney at first slip, the ball cutting back after it hit the turf. O'Neill was caught by Graveney off Statham (1/83), distracted by the loud racing commentary on a radio in the stands, Neil Harvey was bowled by Coldwell for a duck and Lawry by Trueman (3/83) and Australia lost three wickets for 1 run to be left 112/4. The rest of the innings was a grinding match as Dexter rested his fast bowlers and set defensive field until they returned and while all of the remaining Australian batsmen reached double figures none reached 50. Fred Titmus took his new best Test figures of 4/43 as he wheeled his way through the afternoon, trapping Peter Burge lbw for 23 when he swept once too often and having Brian Booth caught by Ken Barrington for 27 trying to repeat a fine glance to leg. Alan Davidson (40) and Ken Mackay (49) added 73 for the eighth-wicket and Mackay and Richie Benaud (36) 52 runs into the next day as they tried to wear down the bowlers. Titmus dismissed them both in the end, Benaud sweeping the ball the Barrington and Mackay lbw after some deliberation by Umpire Smyth. Trueman removed Garth McKenzie (16) after a last-wicket stand of 22 and Australia were all out for 316 with Barry Jarman on 10 not out.|$|R
