25|$|By 1906, <b>steam</b> <b>car</b> {{development}} had advanced, {{and they}} were among the fastest road vehicles in that period.|$|E
25|$|In 1816, a {{professor}} at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired <b>steam</b> <b>car.</b> Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a 2 seated car phaeton.|$|E
25|$|In 1909 Thomas Tilling and LGOC {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} to pool their resources. The agreement restricted the expansion of Thomas Tilling in London, and allowed the LGOC to lead an amalgamation of most of London's bus services. However, also in 1909 Thomas Clarkson started the National <b>Steam</b> <b>Car</b> Company to run steam buses in London in competition with the LGOC. In 1919 the National company reached agreement with the LGOC to withdraw from bus operation in London, and steam bus services ceased later that year.|$|E

5000|$|Brooks Steam Motors, Ltd. was a Canadian {{manufacturer}} of <b>steam</b> <b>cars</b> established in March 1923. Its cars more closely resembled the Stanley Steamers {{in terms of}} engineering rather than the more sophisticated Doble <b>steam</b> <b>cars.</b> The company was formed from the defunct Detroit Steam Motors Corporation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>cars</b> take a {{long time}} to start, but some can reach speeds over 100 mph (161 km/h) eventually. The late model Doble <b>Steam</b> <b>Cars</b> could be brought to {{operational}} condition in less than 30 seconds, had high top speeds, and fast acceleration, but they were ridiculously expensive.|$|R
25|$|A set {{of unique}} glass display {{cabinets}} {{have been put}} back in the museum after undergoing restoration. The cabinets date back to 1850 and were designed to showcase the work of Smith. They {{were removed from the}} upper gallery and have now been cleaned, restored and repaired where necessary. Tim Phelps and his team of specialists based near Knaresborough carried out the work. The cabinets now display items such as a model of George Cayley's original flying machine and an early <b>steam</b> <b>car</b> model by Sir Edward Harland. Lower tiers house artifacts such as fossils, rock samples and minerals.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} 1868 {{version of}} the velocipede is attributed to W.W. Austin of Winthrop, Massachusetts by some early newspaper accounts, which were taken up in later histories. Motoring author L. J. K. Setright believes Austin was only the rider or demonstrator of a Roper machine, and had been misidentified as its inventor. Austin is also mentioned as the owner, in 1901, of both the 1867–1869 Roper velocipede and an older four wheeled Roper <b>steam</b> <b>car.</b> The Smithsonian says a [...] "Professor" [...] W.W. Austin had exhibited a Roper steamer of unknown date, leading to the erroneous attrition to Austin instead of Roper. A Roper velocipede was {{on display at the}} first New York Auto Show in Madison Square Garden in November 1900, and again Austin was sometimes described as the inventor.|$|E

50|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>cars</b> {{became less}} popular after the {{adoption}} of the electric starter, which eliminated the need for risky hand cranking to start gasoline-powered cars. The introduction of assembly-line mass production by Henry Ford, which hugely reduced the cost of owning a conventional automobile, was also a strong factor in the <b>steam</b> <b>car's</b> demise as the Model T was both cheap and reliable.|$|R
2500|$|The {{event was}} a {{publicity}} exercise organised by Pierre Giffard of Le Petit Journal newspaper {{and consisted of}} 69 cars starting a [...] selection event before 25 were allowed into the main event, the [...] race from Paris (Porte Maillot) to Rouen. Albert Lemaître completed the course in 9 hours 18 minutes at an average speed of , followed by Auguste Doriot (Peugeot), René Panhard (Panhard) and Émile Levassor (Panhard). Count Jules-Albert de Dion reached Rouen 3’30” ahead of Albert Lemaître but as cars were judged on speed, handling and safety characteristics the official winners were Peugeot and Panhard. De Dion's <b>steam</b> <b>car</b> needed a stoker which was forbidden.|$|E
2500|$|Motor racing {{was started}} in France, {{as a direct result}} of the enthusiasm with which the French public embraced the motor car. Manufacturers were {{enthusiastic}} due to the possibility of using motor racing as a shop window for their cars. The first motoring contest took place on July 22, 1894 and was organised by a Paris newspaper, Le Petit Journal. The Paris–Rouen rally was , from Porte Maillot in Paris, through the Bois de Boulogne, to Rouen. Count Jules-Albert de Dion was first into Rouen after 6 hours 48 minutes at an average speed of [...] He finished 3 minutes 30 seconds ahead of Albert Lemaître (Peugeot), followed by Doriot (Peugeot, 16 minutes 30 seconds back), René Panhard (Panhard, 33 minutes 30 seconds back), and Émile Levassor (Panhard, 55 minutes 30 seconds back). The official winners were Peugeot and Panhard as cars were judged on their speed, handling and safety characteristics, and De Dion's <b>steam</b> <b>car</b> needed a stoker which the judges deemed to be outside of their objectives.|$|E
2500|$|William Kirk, {{driver of}} the steam tram car on the Derby-road, was summoned for using abusive and {{threatening}} language to Israel Jordan, {{driver of the}} Nottingham and Bulwell omnibus. Mr. W.H. Stevenson appeared for the complainant and Mr. Barlow for the defendant. Mr. Stevenson said this was another instance in which the Tramway Company endeavoured to monopolise all {{the streets in the}} town. There was a case before the Bench the other week in which the company summoned one of this complainant's drivers for being {{on the wrong side of}} the road. The Bench dismissed the case. The next day Mr. Jordan was driving along Derby-road when the defendant used abusive language to him, and said [...] "You beat us yesterday, but I'll be even with you before the week is out. The first time I meet you I'll knock you and the bus off the road." [...] Defendant also threatened to give complainant a [...] "good hiding". Israel Jordan was then called, and said he was one of the proprietors of the Nottingham and Bulwell Bus. He corroborated the statement of Mr. Stevenson. In reply to Mr. Barlow, he denied that he first used threatening language towards complainant. Frederick Bramley, residing at Hucknall Torkard also corroborated.-- There was a cross summons taken out by Kirk against Jordan for abusive language, and obstructing the <b>steam</b> <b>car.</b> The charge of using abusive language was withdrawn, but the other was proceeded with and Kirk was placed in the witness box. After hearing his evidence, however, the Bench dismissed the summons against Jordan, and fined Kirk 10s. The also expressed a hope that a better feeling would be established between tramcar drivers and conductors and the drivers of other vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Assembly-line mass {{production}} by Henry Ford dramatically reduced {{the cost of}} owning a conventional automobile, was also a strong factor in the <b>steam</b> <b>car's</b> demise as the Model T was both cheap and reliable. Additionally, during the 'heyday' of <b>steam</b> <b>cars,</b> {{the internal combustion engine}} made steady gains in efficiency, matching and then surpassing the efficiency of a steam engine when the weight of a boiler is factored in.|$|R

The term [...] "Doble steam car" [...] comprises any of several makes of steam-powered automobile in the early 20th century, including Doble Detroit, Doble <b>Steam</b> <b>Car,</b> and Doble Automobile, severally called a [...] "Doble" [...] because of their founding or association with Abner Doble.|$|E

A Blenheim engineer, John Birch, constructed the Marlborough in 1912 and several cars named Carlton's between 1922 and 1928 at Gisborne. One of these is still in existence with the Gisborne vintage car club.|$|R
