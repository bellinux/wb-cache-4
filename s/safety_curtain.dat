5|$|The dragon motif is {{repeated}} in the radial coffers of the caisson and the timbered coffers throughout the theatre. The Imperial dragon is accompanied by {{the symbol of the}} Empress, the Chinese phoenix (Fèng huáng), sometimes called Ho-Ho or Ho-Oh Bird from the Japanese. This personal symbol of the Empress is also repeated throughout the theatre, but most prominently in relief as part of the grills above false balconies that once screened organ pipes. In addition to these symbols, orange blossoms, chrysanthemums, and lotus flowers appear throughout the theatre. The highly decorated proscenium arch and <b>safety</b> <b>curtain</b> maintain the Chinese design influence.|$|E

In 2008, a specially curated selection of Twombly's photographic work was exhibited in Huis Marseille, the Museum for Photography, Amsterdam; the exhibition was opened by Sally Mann. For the season 2010/2011 in the Vienna State Opera Cy Twombly designed the large scale picture (176 sqm) Bacchus {{as part of the}} exhibition series <b>Safety</b> <b>Curtain,</b> conceived by museum in progress. In 2011, the Museum Brandhorst, mounted a retrospective of Twombly's photographs from 1951 to 2010. It later was passed over to the Museum für Gegenwartskunst at Siegen and the Palais des Beaux Arts, Brussels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Safety</b> Light <b>curtains</b> are {{opto-electronic}} {{devices that}} are used to safeguard personnel in the vicinity of moving machinery with the potential to cause harm such as presses, winders and palletisers. <b>Safety</b> Light <b>curtains</b> can be used as an alternative to mechanical barriers and other forms of traditional machine guarding. By reducing the need for physical guards and barriers, <b>safety</b> light <b>curtains</b> can increase the maintainability of the equipment they are guarding. The operability and efficiency of machinery can also be improved by the use of <b>safety</b> light <b>curtains</b> by, for example, allowing easier access for semi-automatic procedures.|$|R
50|$|Among {{his works}} are the {{theatrical}} murals on the <b>Safety</b> <b>curtains</b> at Ashcroft Theatre (1982) and Royal Theatre (Northampton) (1978). He also did church murals at St. Andrew's Church, Kettering, St Margaret's Church, Denton (1975-76), All Saints' Church, Earls Barton (1935, rood screen), and St Crispins Hospital, Danetree Hospital, and Northampton Guildhall.|$|R
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>Curtains</b> go {{way back}} to the days of gas {{lighting}} and were meant to stop a fire onstage or backstage spreading to the auditorium. The Ashcroft Curtain was painted in 1982 by an artist called Henry Bird. A Northampton-based artist famous for his murals and curtains. He died in 2000 aged 90.|$|R
500|$|After {{settling}} in London in 1965, Epstein rented {{an office in}} Monmouth Street, and later bought the lease of the Saville Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue. He promoted new works by writers such as Arnold Wesker, in productions that occasionally fell foul of the Lord Chamberlain for including [...] "obscene" [...] content or nudity. In 1966 Epstein reinvented it as a music venue featuring various US acts. On 20 February 1967, Epstein sacked {{the manager of the}} theatre, one Michael Bullock, for lowering the <b>safety</b> <b>curtain</b> the previous day shortly before the end of a Chuck Berry concert that Epstein was attending with Lennon and Starr. Two fans had climbed onto the stage to dance, the curtain came down, and they were pushed from the stage. Although Bullock had not given the order, he was held responsible.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "very popular {{notion that}} our theatres {{ought to be}} very small" [...] proved hard to overcome, however. Various {{accounts}} from the period bemoan the mammoth size of the new theatre, longing for the [...] "warm close observant seats of Old Drury," [...] as one May 1794 theatre-goer put it. Actress Sarah Siddons, then part of the Drury Lane company, called it [...] "a wilderness of a place" [...] (and left Drury Lane along with her brother John Philip Kemble in 1803). Not only was any sense of intimacy and connection to the company on stage lost, but the very size of the theatre put {{a great deal of}} the audience at such a distance from the stage so as to make hearing a player's voice quite difficult. To compensate, the productions mounted in the new theatre tended more toward spectacle than the spoken word. An example of such a spectacle is a 1794 production that featured real water flowing down a rocky stream into a lake large enough on which to row a boat. This water issued from tanks in the attics above the house, which were installed – along with a much-touted iron <b>safety</b> <b>curtain</b> – as proof against fire.|$|E
2500|$|In 1918, she reteamed with Sidney Franklin, who {{directed}} The <b>Safety</b> <b>Curtain,</b> Her Only Way, Forbidden City, The Heart of Wetona, and 1919's The Probation Wife. These films have small-scale settings and familiar actors appearing from one film to the next. An {{advantage of the}} East Coast locale was access to the country's best high-fashion designers, such as Madame Francis and Lucile. Between 1919 and 1920, Talmadge's name appeared on a regular monthly fashion advice column for Photoplay magazine; her publicist was Beulah Livingstone.|$|E
50|$|Typically, <b>safety</b> light <b>curtains</b> are {{connected}} to a safety relay which will remove motive power from the hazard {{in the event that}} an object is detected. Safety relays can be provided with muting functionality which enables the temporary disabling of the safety function to allow objects to pass through the <b>safety</b> light <b>curtains</b> without tripping the safety relay. This is particularly useful for machinery which has some semi-automatic procedures.|$|R
50|$|Given {{that the}} {{footprint}} of the theatre was small—and the theatre {{was intended to}} hold an audience of 1700—the architect was forced to build high, but with disastrous consequences. On December 8, 1881, a fire broke out shortly before a performance of Les contes d'Hoffmann, and 449 people were killed. The following year, a new law was passed, regarding the outfitting and safety provisions, including <b>safety</b> <b>curtains,</b> outwards-opening doors and fireproofing of the set.|$|R
50|$|The {{system was}} used as a cleaner and more compact {{alternative}} to steam engines, to power workshop machinery, lifts, cranes, theatre machinery (including revolving stages at the London Palladium and the London Coliseum, <b>safety</b> <b>curtains</b> at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, the lifting mechanism for the cinema organ at the Leicester Square theatre and the complete Palm Court orchestra platform), and the backup mechanism of Tower Bridge. It was also used to supply fire hydrants, mostly those inside buildings. The water, pumped straight from the Thames, was heated in winter to prevent freezing.|$|R
2500|$|Manchester's Hydraulic Power {{system was}} a public {{hydraulic}} power network supplying energy across the city of Manchester via a system of high-pressure water pipes from three pumping stations from 1894 until 1972. [...] The system, which provided a cleaner and more compact alternative to steam engines, was used to power workshop machinery, lifts, cranes {{and a large number}} of cotton baling presses in warehouses as it was particularly useful for processes that required intermittent power. It was used to wind Manchester Town Hall clock, pump the organ at Manchester Cathedral and raise the <b>safety</b> <b>curtain</b> at Manchester Opera House in Quay Street.|$|E
2500|$|The {{auditorium}} seats 1,785. The ceiling panelling fans {{out from}} a single centre ceiling rose - each panel originally contained painted scenes, although they are currently plain. The proscenium is surrounded by heavy marble and plasterwork borders. Above the proscenium an elegant design with cherubs flanking a crown and a K/T emblem provides a focal point to the theatre when the curtain is down. The red curtain has simple gilding, but often remains unseen as it is unused for many of today's productions. The seats and drapes are of a rich red material. The <b>safety</b> <b>curtain</b> features a painted design of drapes, and framed in the centre is a projection screen. At Grand Circle level two boxes {{on either side of}} the auditorium continue where the grand circle balcony finishes. A further box (now disused) is located at Upper Circle level above this, with an elaborate domed canopy. Three domed alcoves sit along either side of the upper circle. Comedian and actor Billy Connolly famously described it as [...] "like performing inside a wedding cake".|$|E

50|$|In 1762 as a {{consequence}} of the fighting during the British expedition against Cuba, the English superiority took its toll on all the fortresses. The <b>safety</b> <b>curtains</b> and bastions of La Punta castle were destroyed during the invasion. At this time a chain branching out in several directions and held by heavy wood beams was laid. Its ends were tied to guns set-in at La Punta and El Morro. Some fragments of this piece still remain.Later on, with the Spanish were back in power, a new governor arrived, fixing and enlarging the fortification system. In the 19th century some changes, such as the 4 esplanades built to accommodate a corresponding number of artillery pieces, were added at La Punta.|$|R

With the implementation of the CSC in safety related systems, a considerable reduction in costs for development and certification is achieved. Time to market is reduced noticeably. The structures of the CSC and the safety related permanent firmware are described here as well. Examples are shown to demonstrate possible applications. For example, the CSC assumes all control and monitoring functions in simple fail safe sensor/actuator systems. In complex devices (such as <b>safety</b> light <b>curtains,</b> drives) it can be integrated as a communication interface. There is a function and data interface available to serve as an interface to the application. This allows the user to access the CANopen functions, safety relevant data and the Object Dictionary.

5000|$|... ===Ram / Slide=== The {{vertical}} {{motion of the}} slide acts like a hammer to an anvil. When presses are used manually, where an operator is loading and unloading parts, extreme caution should be used and proper methods of safe guarding should be in place. With the addition of <b>safety</b> light <b>curtains</b> and an I-PRESS control, the light curtains can then be muted or turned off on the slide upstroke to increase productivity when press is being used in single stroke mode. Standard modes of operation with up to date safe press controls are OFF-INCH-SINGLE STROKE & CONTINUOUS modes which can be selected via a keyed mode selector switch. Special modes of operation include, MICRO INCH-SSD/SINGLE ON DEMAND & CSD/CONTINUOUS ON DEMAND. Micro Inch is normally used for die set up near the BDC / Bottom Dead Center, SSD Single Stroke on Demand can be used when long coil feed lengths or automation loading and unloading will trigger SSD. CSD Continuous on Demand is normally used when press are used in roll form lines or irregular stroking is required when punching holes in large panel with gag feed dies.|$|R
