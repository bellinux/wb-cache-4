500|$|The Act {{extends the}} reach of implied {{conditions}} first {{laid out in the}} Sale of Goods Act 1893. Section 1 replaced Section 12 of the 1893 Act, containing 3 types of implied undertakings to title; a condition that the seller has the right to sell, or will when the property has passed to him, a warranty that the goods have no additional costs that the buyer has not been informed of, and a warranty of quiet possession. These provisions cannot be excluded, although if there is, in the original contract, a provision that the seller can only transfer what title he has, there is no condition that the seller has the right to sell. The Act also regulated <b>sale</b> <b>by</b> <b>description,</b> where products are sold based on a description given of them. Section 2 provides that [...] "a sale of goods shall not be prevented from being a <b>sale</b> <b>by</b> <b>description</b> by reason only that, being exposed for sale or hire, they are selected by the buyer". This is to ensure that a sale in a self-service store is considered <b>sale</b> <b>by</b> <b>description,</b> and that the sale is therefore covered by other provisions.|$|E

"The {{agreement}} came {{in response}} to concerns in the gold market after the United Kingdom treasury {{announced that it was}} proposing to sell 58% of UK gold reserves through Bank of England auctions, coupled with the prospect of significant <b>sales</b> <b>by</b> the Swiss National Bank and the possibility of on-going <b>sales</b> <b>by</b> Austria and the Netherlands, plus proposals of <b>sales</b> <b>by</b> the IMF. The UK announcement, in particular, had greatly unsettled the market because, unlike most other European <b>sales</b> <b>by</b> central banks in recent years, it was announced in advance. <b>Sales</b> <b>by</b> such countries as Belgium and the Netherlands had always been discreet and announced after the event. So the Washington/European Agreement was at least perceived as putting a cap on European sales." ...|$|R
