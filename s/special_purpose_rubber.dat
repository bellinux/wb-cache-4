50|$|Due to the {{collapse}} of Soviet Union, the Malyshev Factory was no longer able to obtain ceramic armour modules from Russia and only the initial batch of T-84 were produced with such. Instead, later batches of T-84's composite armour is composed of <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>rubber</b> sandwiched between steel and alloy plates. The exact comparison of new and previous armor performance is not known and highly depend on performance of dynamic armor which continuously improved.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of carbon black types P- 803 and S 800 on elastic, strength and deformation properties of rubbers intended for production of molded rubber products has been studied. As objects of research the rubber mixtures based on combination of {{general purpose rubber}} SRI- 3 +SRD and <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>rubber</b> BNRS- 18 AMN were used. The studies of chemical composition of the surface of various carbon black types revealed that the surf ace of carbon black type S 800 contains {{a large amount of}} sulfur and a minimal amount of oxygen, the presence of which may influence the curing process, and consequent-ly on the elastic and mechanical properties of rubbers. It was established that P- 803 carbon black type substitution by S 800 type leads to increase in streng th characteristics, Shore A hardness and to decrease in relative compression set of vulcanizates based on BNRS- 18 AMN. In rubber based on combination of rubbers SRI- 3 +SRD with carbon black type S 800 re vealed decrease resistance against growth tears and increase Shore A hardness of vulcani zates, compared with samples of rubber with carbon black type P- 803. The character of changes in rubber properties {{may be due to the}} {{influence of}} the carbon black type on the structure and density of curing grid...|$|E

5000|$|On a boat {{having an}} inboard motor that turns a shaft {{attached}} to an external propeller, the shaft passes though a stuffing box, also termed a 'stern gland' in this application. The stuffing box prevents sea water {{from entering the}} boat's hull. In many small fiberglass boats, for example, the stuffing box is mounted inboard near the point the shaft exits the hull. The [...] "box" [...] is a cylindrical assembly, typically of bronze, comprising a sleeve threaded on one end to accept adjusting and locking nuts. A <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> heavy-duty <b>rubber</b> hose attaches the stuffing box to a stern tube, also called a shaft log, that projects inward from the hull. Marine-duty hose clamps secure the hose to the stern tube and the stuffing box. A sound stuffing box installation is critical to safety because failure can admit a catastrophic volume of water into the boat.|$|R
40|$|This book is {{intended}} {{for those people who}} have a knowledge or understanding of rubber materials and processes but who wish to update their knowledge. It should be read in conjunction with Developments in Rubber Technology-l as that volume discussed developments in natural <b>rubber</b> and selected <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> synthetic <b>rubbers</b> as well as additives. The authors have been selected for their expertise in each particular field and we, as editors, would like to express our appreciation to the individual authors and also to their companies. Such a book would be impossible to produce without such active cooperation as we have received. Volumes 1 and 2 of Developments in Rubber Technology cover rubbers which are processed and vulcanised in the traditional manner. It is appreciated that the omission of non-vulcanised rubber materials (the so­ called thermoplastic elastomers) will be unwelcome to many readers but it {{is intended}}, because {{of the size of the}} subject, to cover these materials in a subsequent volume.

40|$|In {{addition}} to the ordinary corporate income tax, <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> taxes are sometimes levied to extract abnormal profits arising {{from the use of}} natural resources. Such dual tax regimes exist in Norway for oil and hydropower, where the corresponding <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> tax bases are unaffected by any derivatives payments. Dual tax firms with hedging programs therefore face the risk of potentially large discrepancies between the tax bases for corporate income tax and <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> tax. I investigate how this tax base asymmetry influences the extent of hedging of value-maximizing firms facing hedgeable as well as unhedgeable risk. Dual tax firms facing deadweight costs in low-profit events generally demand less hedging than ordinary firms, but otherwise respond similarly to characteristics of the underlying risk exposures. The <b>special</b> <b>purpose</b> tax does not influence firms' hedge portfolios in the absence of deadweight cost.
