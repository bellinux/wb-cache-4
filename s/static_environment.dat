25|$|Though a {{significant}} percentage of robots in commission today are either human controlled or operate in a <b>static</b> <b>environment,</b> there is an increasing interest in robots that can operate autonomously in a dynamic environment. These robots require some combination of navigation hardware and software in order to traverse their environment. In particular, unforeseen events (e.g. people and other obstacles that are not stationary) can cause problems or collisions. Some highly advanced robots such as ASIMO and Meinü robot have particularly good robot navigation hardware and software. Also, self-controlled cars, Ernst Dickmanns' driverless car, and the entries in the DARPA Grand Challenge, are capable of sensing the environment well and subsequently making navigational decisions based on this information. Most of these robots employ a GPS navigation device with waypoints, along with radar, sometimes combined with other sensory data such as lidar, video cameras, and inertial guidance systems for better navigation between waypoints.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Global {{illumination}} is {{the physically}} accurate calculation of lighting in an environment. It is computationally expensive for <b>static</b> <b>environments</b> {{and even more}} so for dynamic environments. Not only are many images required for an animation, but the calculation involved increases with the presence of moving objects. In <b>static</b> <b>environments,</b> global illumination algorithms can precompute a lighting solution and reuse it whenever the viewpoint changes, but in dynamic environments, any moving object or light potentially affects the illumination of every other object in a scene. To guarantee accuracy, the algorithm has to recompute the entire lighting solution for each frame. This paper describes a perceptually-based technique that can dramatically reduce this computational load. The technique may also be used in image based rendering, geometry level of detail selection, realistic image synthesis, video telephony and video compression. Perceptually-based rendering opera...|$|R

500|$|Kaneko was {{the first}} to propose the game's concept, which was then worked on by other staff members. The initial game's themes were defined as [...] "awakening" [...] and [...] "change", {{referenced}} in how the characters gradually awoke to their emotions and the <b>static</b> <b>environment</b> of the Junkyard was drastically changed. The Junkyard was designed to emphasize the desperation of the characters during their awakening. The concept behind the demon transformations originated during the development of Shin Megami Tensei. Kaneko, who worked on Shin Megami Tensei, had wanted the game's Chaos Hero to regularly switch between his human and demon forms. The idea did not appear in the finished game, but eventually reemerged and became the base for Digital Devil Sagas gameplay. The game's character models were created based on development knowledge from Nocturne. Creating the models proved difficult due to the need to extensively use level of detail while staying true Kaneko's distinctive designs. While Nocturne was defined by its [...] "static" [...] feel, the team wanted Digital Devil Saga to have a feeling of motion to contrast Nocturne. Makoto Kitano was responsible for creating 3D representations of the game's demons, A noted element was the design of Cerberus, which combined elements of the three-headed version first designed for [...] and the shape of sharks. One of the additional challenges was the fact that it {{was the first}} Megami Tensei title to feature extensive voice acting, inspired by the need to fully express the game's themes and story. Before the official voice actors were cast, Atlus staff provided the characters' voices. Due to the wish to appeal to a wider audience than previous Megami Tensei games, the proposed amount of violence and graphic imagery was cut down.|$|E

40|$|Efficient {{processing}} of skyline queries {{has been an}} area of growing interest over both <b>static</b> and stream <b>environments.</b> Most existing <b>static</b> and streaming techniques assume that the skyline query is applied to a single data source. Un-fortunately, {{this is not true}} in many applications in which, due to the complexity of the schema, the skyline query may involve attributes belonging to multiple data sources. Re-cently, in the context of <b>static</b> <b>environments,</b> various hybrid skyline-join algorithms have been proposed. However, these algorithms suffer from several drawbacks: they often need to scan the data sources exhaustively in order to obtain the set of skyline-join results; moreover, the pruning techniques em-ployed to eliminate the tuples are largely based on expensive pairwise tuple-to-tuple comparisons. On the other hand, most existing streaming methods focus on single stream sky-line analysis, thus rendering these techniques unsuitable for applications that require a real-time “join ” operation to be carried out before the skyline query can be answered. Based on these observations, we introduce and propose to demon-strate SkySuite: a framework of skyline-join operators that can be leveraged to efficiently process skyline-join queries over both <b>static</b> and stream <b>environments.</b> Among others, SkySuite includes (1) a novel Skyline-Sensitive Join (SSJ) operator that effectively processes skyline-join queries in <b>static</b> <b>environments,</b> and (2) a Layered Skyline-window-Join (LSJ) operator that incrementally maintains skyline-join re-sults over stream environments. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a dynamic variant of a coordination problem that was studied in, e. g., [9, 7, 8]. The original problem {{is concerned with}} a <b>static</b> task <b>environment</b> where all composite tasks consisting of elementary tasks and their interdependencies are given in advance. We introduce a dynamic variant of this problem where multiple composite tasks arrive dynamically in the system. We present a framework for dynamic task environments and explain the coordination problem that arises if multiple autonomous agents {{have to work together}} on parts of a composite task. From this explanation of the coordination problem we derive a formal definition. As an approach to solve the coordination problem, we suggest the idea of task partitioning. We conclude the paper with a simple solution method: the partitioning algorithm. This algorithm was originally designed to work in <b>static</b> <b>environments,</b> but turned out to be applicable in a dynamic context as well. ...|$|R
