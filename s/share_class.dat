40|$|There {{is a long}} running {{debate over}} whether {{a portion of the}} fees that {{investment}} advisory firms charge are disproportionate or “excessive ” relative to the services they provide. We examine this issue using a comprehensive sample of index mutual funds covering the period from 1998 to 2007. We posit that excessive fees are prevalent in funds with multiple <b>share</b> <b>classes</b> and those with weak governance structures. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that (i) fee spreads, the range of fees charged to the lowest and highest cost <b>share</b> <b>classes</b> of the same fund, are positively related to the number of <b>share</b> <b>classes</b> offered (about 20 basis points per class), (ii) internal governance mechanisms only matter for funds with relatively small <b>share</b> <b>classes</b> where investors often face increased search costs and/or restricted access to competitive mutual funds, (iii) funds managed by public sponsors are associated with disproportionately higher fee spreads (about 9 basis points), and (iv) for a sample of funds with multiple classes, boards comprised exclusively of independent directors or those with fund sponsor officers are associated with lower fee spreads (about 11 basis points). Overall, our results indicate that competition and agency considerations are important determinants in the pricing of mutual funds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Some investors {{may not be}} able to use {{leverage}} at all or {{they face}} different margin requirements. Investing in securities with high-embedded leverage enables those investors to obtain desired level of market exposure without violating their margin constraints. Investors in hedge funds can gain access to this high-embedded leverage by investing in hedge fund <b>share</b> <b>classes</b> that have leverage multipliers higher than one. Hedge funds characteristically exploit different arbitrage and speculative investment strategies. These strategies typically entail illiquid assets, and to obtain the flexibility hedge funds often restrict investors’ ability for capital redemptions. This is done by applying different share restrictions. Illiquid investments can also yield to serially correlated returns. This study employs extensive hedge fund database, which is constructed by merging five individual databases. The use of this database contributes to previous academic studies, since such thorough database has not been employed in studies concerning hedge funds. Furthermore, this study contributes to the recent academic studies by investigating the return differences between unleveraged and leveraged hedge fund <b>share</b> <b>classes.</b> Additionally, this study considers, whether the return spread is larger for hedge funds that invest in illiquid assets. Finally, this study investigates whether some predefined macroeconomic and risk factors are able to explain those returns differences. This study finds two specific implications that contribute to the previous academic literature. First, there exists a return difference between unleveraged and leveraged <b>share</b> <b>classes,</b> and that difference is statistically and economically significant. Second, return difference can be partly explained by some macroeconomic and risk variables. Aggregate hedge fund flow has a positive relationship with the return difference and it acts as a key variable in explaining those return differences. Additionally, this study finds that overall movements in financial markets affect the returns of leveraged hedge fund <b>share</b> <b>classes.</b> Increases in different risk variables cause leveraged <b>share</b> <b>classes</b> to reduce their exposures and their leverage is not constantly at the promised level. This makes them to resemble more their unleveraged pairs and induces return difference to decrease. As a conclusion, returns of leveraged <b>share</b> <b>classes,</b> scaled with their respective leverage, are lower than the returns of unleveraged <b>share</b> <b>classes.</b> This finding brings important implications for hedge fund investors. Ability of some macro and risk variables to explain the return difference helps investors to understand the factors affecting the return spread and help them to time leveraged hedge fund investments properly...|$|R
