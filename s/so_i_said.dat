5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E
25|$|I used {{to watch}} him and Graham working on IMT, {{and look at them}} with great envy. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> 'what about Bert Newton?' If I’m going to work with {{somebody}} I want to know that he's as sharp as anything and a real pro.|$|E
25|$|In March 1982 {{he worked}} in Modena, Italy, and from November, Basquiat worked from the ground-floor display and studio space Larry Gagosian had built below his Venice, California, home and {{commenced}} a series of paintings for a 1983 show, his second at Gagosian Gallery, then in West Hollywood. He brought along his girlfriend, then unknown aspiring singer Madonna. Gagosian recalls, “Everything was going along fine. Jean-Michel was making paintings, I was selling them, and {{we were having a}} lot of fun. But then one day Jean-Michel said, ‘My girlfriend is coming to stay with me.’ I was a little concerned-one too many eggs can spoil an omelet, you know? <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> ‘Well, what’s she like?’ And he said, He said, ‘Her name is Madonna and she’s going to be huge.’ I’ll never forget that he said that. So Madonna came out and stayed for a few months and we all got along like one big, happy family.” During this time he took considerable interest in the work that Robert Rauschenberg was producing at Gemini G.E.L. in West Hollywood, visiting him on several occasions and finding inspiration in the accomplishments of the painter. In 1982, Basquiat worked briefly with musician and artist David Bowie.|$|E

500|$|Beastie Boys {{were signed}} as the opening act, while record {{producer}} Patrick Leonard was the music director. [...] "At first I said, 'The {{girl in the}} underwear? Gedoudahere!'" [...] he recalled in 1992. [...] "But then I met {{her and she was}} just this vicious thing. You know, right in your face with, 'This is what I need. The tour's three months long. Whaddo I know about a band? You do it.' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> okay." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{screenplay}} Griffith wrote was Cardula, a Dracula-themed story {{involving a}} vampire music critic. After Corman rejected the idea, Griffith says {{he wrote a}} screenplay titled Gluttony, in which the protagonist was [...] "a salad chef in a restaurant who would wind up cooking customers and stuff like that, you know? We couldn’t do that though because of the code at the time. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> “How about a man-eating plant?”, and Roger said, “Okay.” By that time, we were both drunk." ...|$|E
500|$|McCartney and Ono had {{attempted}} to purchase the catalogue in 1981. They were offered the catalogue for £20million ($40million USD) and proposed the pair would each pay £10million. Ono refused as {{she thought it was}} too high a price. McCartney spoke about the offer at a press conference in April 1990, explaining that Ono [...] "actually said 'I think we can get it for 5.' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Well ok, you know, let's see what we can do.' And we couldn't." ...|$|E

500|$|The movie's strange title {{originated}} from something said by Ringo Starr, who described {{it this way}} {{in an interview with}} disc jockey Dave Hull in 1964: [...] "We went to do a job, and we'd worked all day and we happened to work all night. I came up still thinking it was day I suppose, and I said, 'It's been a hard day ...' and I looked around and saw it was dark <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> '... night!'

500|$|What happened? I {{signed a}} shitty deal, but luckily it was non-exclusive. I {{got tired of}} doing Strapping <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'I can't do it anymore.' Then I freaked out and went into a hospital. My lawyer said that I was under mental duress when I signed the {{contract}} so the contract is void. At that point it was like, 'I just won't do another Strapping record.' Yeah, I went down saying 'CM was the shittiest label ever.' And they went down as saying that I was 'a complete, arrogant psychopath.' ...|$|E
500|$|In his memoir, he {{describes}} how one {{was an old}} friend who was keen to have children but feared she {{was running out of}} time. [...] "We had never been involved romantically but I knew her well enough to know she would be a wonderful mother and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I would like to be the father of her children." [...] A daughter was born in 1990, and another in 1992. Then another friend said she'd like to have children: [...] "And we agreed to have a baby." [...] Their son was born within weeks of his daughter in 1992.|$|E

When asked by chat-show host Larry King in 2003, how life was with McCartney, Mills replied [...] "Great, really great", but also {{said that she}} was surprised at how tidy McCartney was: [...] "He always cleans up before the cleaner comes. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> for a while that's crazy, but what's good is if I cook the dinner, he'll clean everything up." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{legacy of}} Rosewood {{remained}} in Levy County. For decades no black residents lived in Cedar Key or Sumner. Robin Raftis, the white {{editor of the}} Cedar Key Beacon, tried to place the events in an open forum by printing Moore's story. She had been collecting anecdotes for many years, and said, [...] "Things happened {{out there in the}} woods. There's no doubt about that. How bad? We don't know... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Okay guys, I'm opening the closet with the skeletons, because if we don't learn from mistakes, we're doomed to repeat them'." [...] Raftis received notes reading, [...] "We know how to get you and your kids. All it takes is a match".|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Monsters, Inc. was {{conceived}} in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during {{the production of}} Toy Story. One of the ideas {{that came out of}} the brainstorming session was a film about monsters. [...] "When we were making Toy Story", Docter said, [...] "everybody came up to me and said 'Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room.' So when Disney asked us to do some more films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Hey, let's do a film about monsters.|$|E

500|$|... "Alive and Schticking" [...] {{was written}} by Bill Wrubel and {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. In July 2005, it was announced by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) that Will & Graces season premiere for season eight would be performed live. It was also confirmed that actor Alec Baldwin would appear in the episode. This was Baldwin's third appearance, as he guest starred in two episodes from season seven, playing Will's boss. His initial decision to do the show was to work with Megan Mullally, who plays Karen; [...] "I just love Megan. And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Well, {{if you let me}} do it with Megan.' And they said 'You got it.' So I went and did that with them for four [...] It was fun. For me now, it's about who I work with." ...|$|E
500|$|Gordon {{had been}} {{considering}} {{a man that}} turned invisible {{in the political and}} metaphorical sense for a while, but he still needed a way for physical invisibility. The eventual concept came after the writer spoke with his ophthalmologist brother, who told about blind spots regarding malfunctioning retinal spots or optic nerves, which do not impair humans due to a brain compensation. Gordon noted, [...] "these stories come from scientific research... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> what if someone could actually create a field of vision where none actually exists?" [...] Gordon decided to use a Vietnam War veteran given [...] "they are getting old, and like the Holocaust survivor of 'Kaddish', starting to die", and the opportunity would allow a larger role for Skinner. General MacDougal was named after the show's editor, Heather MacDougall.|$|E
500|$|... 'You know what, I'm {{going to}} be freezing.

I thought that that would still work as a visual, but then we got there and it was like 20 degrees below zero, it was bitterly cold, and I was barefoot. I was barefoot for the entire video, and then it started pouring rain and everyone got really sick, and it just actually {{turned out to be a}} really miserable experience.|$|E

500|$|The actress also {{recounted the}} story to Alan Mercer of Dazzling Diva.com, saying: [...] "I told them I don't want any more money. I just want to direct one episode {{in the next two}} year cycle. I didn't think that was so horrible. I didn't want to direct six episodes. They still said no. Basically, I was fired at the end of year eight. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> good-bye, and Larry said 'see you next season.' I told him I won't be coming back. He said, [...] "What!?!" [...] I told him, [...] "They fired me because I want to direct one episode, and if that's their stance, I'm out of here." [...] He was stunned and he said if you go I go. He denies that to this day. He really went to bat for me." [...] Gray {{remained}} a member of the principal cast until she left the show in its twelfth season. Her departure came as a surprise, but her publicist said that after eleven years on the show, she wished to pursue other things.|$|E
500|$|A few {{innovative}} commercial directors immediately saw {{the ways}} in which sound could be employed {{as an integral part of}} cinematic storytelling, beyond the obvious function of recording speech. In Blackmail, Hitchcock manipulated the reproduction of a character's monologue so the word [...] "knife" [...] would leap out from a blurry stream of sound, reflecting the subjective impression of the protagonist, who is desperate to conceal her involvement in a fatal stabbing. In his first film, the Paramount Applause (1929), Rouben Mamoulian created the illusion of acoustic depth by varying the volume of ambient sound in proportion to the distance of shots. At a certain point, Mamoulian wanted the audience to hear one character singing at the same time as another prays; according to the director, [...] "They said we couldn't record the two things—the song and the prayer—on one mike and one channel. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to the sound man, 'Why not use two mikes and two channels and combine the two tracks in printing?'" [...] Such methods would eventually become standard procedure in popular filmmaking.|$|E
500|$|Slay Tracks was {{recorded}} during a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing {{the studio and}} the recording process, said, [...] "You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big pot plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was us going in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a glide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top." [...] Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, [...] " [...] {{come in and they}} play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'" [...] Kannberg said, [...] "We did it really fast. We probably spent one day tracking and one day mixing it." [...] The title of the EP had been decided prior to its recording, and the pseudonyms S.M. and Spiral Stairs were used to credit Malkmus and Kannberg respectively.|$|E
