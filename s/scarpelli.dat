5000|$|The {{film was}} shot in a cinema vérité style, which {{presented}} a unique challenge to the filmmakers {{because they did not}} speak the native language; oftentimes, they wouldn’t know exactly what they had filmed until they got to the editing room and worked with a translator. Both filmmakers have said that being foreign women and having an all-female crew gave them unique access and allowed them into places that foreign men would have had a much harder time entering. Because of <b>Scarpelli’s</b> background in journalism, she characterizes the film as long-form journalism. “The point of it is to inform and spark dialogue about local journalism under fire.” ...|$|R
2500|$|The Good, the Bad and the Ugly ( [...] , [...] ) is a 1966 epic Spaghetti Western film {{directed}} by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach {{in their respective}} title roles. Its screenplay was written by Age & <b>Scarpelli,</b> Luciano Vincenzoni and Leone (with additional screenplay material and dialogue provided by an uncredited Sergio Donati), based on a story by Vincenzoni and Leone. Director of photography Tonino Delli Colli {{was responsible for the}} film's sweeping widescreen cinematography, and Ennio Morricone composed the film's score including its main theme. It was an international co-production between Italy, Spain, West Germany and the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Director Sergio Leone {{noted that}} the film's main theme is its {{emphasis}} on violence and the deconstruction of Old West romanticism. Like many of his films, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly was considered by Leone as a satire of the Western genre. Critic Drew Marton {{described it as a}} [...] "baroque manipulation" [...] that criticizes the American ideology of the Western, by replacing the heroic cowboy popularized by John Wayne with morally complex antiheroes. Negative themes such as capitalism and greed were also given focus, and were traits shared by the three leads in the story. Many critics have also noticed the film's anti-war theme. Taking place in the American Civil War, the film takes the viewpoint of people such as civilians, bandits, and most notably soldiers, and presents their daily hardships during the war. Although not fighting in the war, the three gunslingers gradually become entangled in the battles that ensue (similar to The Great War, a film that screenwriters Luciano Vincenzoni and Age & <b>Scarpelli</b> had contributed to).|$|E
2500|$|While Leone {{developed}} Vincenzoni's idea into a script, the screenwriter {{recommended the}} comedy-writing team of Agenore Incrucci and Furio <b>Scarpelli</b> {{to work on}} it with Leone and Sergio Donati. According to Leone, [...] "I couldn't use a single thing they'd written. It was the grossest deception of my life." [...] Donati agreed, saying, [...] "There was next to nothing of them in the final script. They only wrote the first part. Just one line." [...] Vincenzoni claims that he wrote the screenplay in 11 days, but he soon left the project after his relationship with Leone soured. The three main characters all contain autobiographical elements of Leone. In an interview he said, [...] " [...] has no spirit, he's a professional in the most banal sense of the term. Like a robot. This isn't the case with the other two. On the methodical and careful side of my character, I'd be nearer il Biondo (Blondie): but my most profound sympathy always goes towards the Tuco side... He can be touching with all that tenderness and all that wounded humanity." [...] Film director Alex Cox suggests that the cemetery-buried gold hunted by the protagonists may have been inspired by rumours surrounding the anti-Communist Gladio terrorists, who hid many of their 138 weapons caches in cemeteries.|$|E
40|$|The study {{presented}} in this document {{is the result of}} three years of research into the complex world of Molecular Dynamics applied to biological cell membranes. The simulation of biological tissues involves not only an excellent knowledge of the numerical calculus and its related tools, but a profound comprehension of the biological and medical literature associated with the phenomenon. By the other hand, the use of high performance facilities is essential for the computation of the Molecular Dynamics models in order to obtain results in acceptable times, so the latest technological advances have played a decisive and important part in this eld of research. The presented obtained results about shock wave interaction with biological membranes, as well as the air ow through the alveolar surface, are part of a new line of research usually known as "virtual experimental". This name {{comes from the fact that}} any physical or chemical situation can be re-created into a computer system to calculate its propagation in time. The results of the interaction of shock waves with biological cell membranes have been particularly satisfactory and they have opened a new line of investigation into cancer research. A numerical proportional relation between the shock wave impulse and the value of lateral di usion (from 9. 80 to 12. 84 10. 7 cm 2 s), as well as the simulation of the transient provoked by the wave into a NPT ensemble are a successful achievement. Other computations of this type of interaction have been simulated into an NVE ensemble as well, however the obtained results for the lateral di usion, in the order of 10. 7 cm 2 s, showed no trend regarding the shock wave and the transient e ect could not be simulated. On the other hand, the recreation of the air ow through the alveolar surface is an initial step into the solution of all the controversy surrounding this extremely complex system known as alveolar surface network. An alveolar membrane of around 7 nm has been successfully simulated in agreement with <b>Scarpelli's</b> experiments. This lipid-protein membrane model simulated can serve as a virtual experiment in order to solve the controversy about the alveolar surface. It points to the possibility of air ow through a stable two-layered DPPC phospholipid structure either from a numerical or physical and biological point of view and the existence of an alveolar membrane at the end of the bronchial tubes...|$|R
