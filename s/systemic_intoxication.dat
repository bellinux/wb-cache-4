Mercury blood levels were essentially constant, averaging 62 ng/ml. Although exhalation of mercury vapor was a major route of excretion and urinary mercury rose fivefold with administration of penicillamine, excretion by all routes, estimated for the year after injection, represented only 1 % of the dose. Total body clearance of mercury was only 5 ml/min. Penicillamine therefore appeared to be of little value in reducing the body burden of mercury.

40|$|This case {{illustrates}} {{the potential for}} systemic cobalt toxicity in non-metal-on-metal bearings and its potentially devastating consequences. We present a 71 -year-old male with grinding sensations in his right hip following ceramic-on-ceramic total hip arthroplasty (THA). After diagnosing a fractured ceramic liner, the hip prosthesis was revised into a metal-on-polyethylene bearing. At one year postoperatively, X-rays and MARS-MRI showed a fixed reversed hybrid THA, with periarticular densities, flattening of the femoral head component, and a pattern of periarticular metal wear debris and pseudotumor formation. Before revision could take place, the patient was admitted with the clinical picture of systemic cobalt toxicity, supported by excessively high serum cobalt and chromium levels, and ultimately died. At autopsy dilated cardiomyopathy as {{cause of death was}} hypothesized. A third body wear reaction between ceramic remnants and the metal femoral head very likely led to excessive metal wear, which contributed systemic cobalt toxicity leading to neurotoxicity and heart failure. This case emphasizes that fractured ceramic-on-ceramic bearings should be revised to ceramic-on-ceramic or ceramic-on-polyethylene bearings, but not to metal-on-polyethylene bearings.

The aim of this review is to address the aetiological factors for DDE because the knowledge is essential for clinicians when explaining and discussing the presence of DDE with patients and their parents. The possible aetiological factors for enamel defects in permanent teeth can be broadly divided into two main categories: those with a localized distribution and those with a generalized distribution. Amongst the causative agents of localized defects of enamel are trauma, localized infection and irradiation. Amongst the causative agents of generalized defects of enamel are genetic disorders and <b>systemic</b> disturbances including <b>intoxications,</b> perinatal and postnatal problems, malnutrition, infectious diseases and a range of other medical conditions.

Due to potential food contamination, and bioterrorism concerns, the development of detection reagents, therapeutics and countermeasures are of urgent interest. Recently, we have developed a sensitive electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassay for BoNT/B, using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) MCS 6 - 27 and anti-BoNT/B rabbit polyclonal antibodies as the capture and detector. The ECL assay detected as little as 1 pg/mL BoNT/B in the buffer matrix, surpassing the detection sensitivities of the gold standard mouse bioassays. The ECL assay also allowed detection of BoNT/B in sera matrices of up to 100 % sera with negligible matrix effects.

40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of pharmacological correction of endogenous intoxication in patients with Stages III—IV ovarian cancer (OC) in the perioperative period. Subjects and methods. Thirty-to- 70 -year old seventy patients with Stages III-IV OC who had been surgically treated under general anesthesia were examined. The bio chemical parameters of intoxication, such as middleweight molecules, the total, effective concentration and binding capacity of albumin, integral hematological indices of intoxication, and C-reactive protein, were studied in the perioperative period. Results. Analysis of the performed tests showed that the premorbid background in all the examinees was characterized by varying degrees of endogenous intoxication (EI), increased leukocytic index of intoxication, hematological index of intoxication, and modified hematological index of intoxication, an imbalance between the accumulation and binding of overproduced toxic ligands, the intensified production of acutephase inflammatory proteins by the activation of a systemic inflammatory response, and decreased systemic responsiveness. These changes occur with suppressed <b>systemic</b> responsiveness, inadequate <b>intoxication</b> compensation by physiological detoxification systems and hemostatic instability. Conclusion. The use of heptral and Remaxol {{as part of the}} metabolic pharmacological correction infusion program nonequivalently caused reductions in the activity of an inflammatory response and the efficiency of EI correction in patients with OC in the perioperative period.

Several in vitro methods have been designed for ricin detection in complex food matrices in the event of intentional contamination. Recently, a novel Immuno-PCR (IPCR) assay was developed with a limit of detection of 10 fg/ml in a buffer matrix and about 10 - 1000 -fold greater sensitivity than other methods in various food matrices. In order to devise a better diagnostic test for ricin, the IPCR assay was adapted for the detection of ricin in biological samples collected from mice after intoxication. The limit of detection in both mouse sera and feces was as low as 1 pg/ml. Using the mouse intravenous (iv) model for ricin intoxication, a biphasic half-life of ricin, with a rapid t(1 / 2) α of 4 min and a slower t(1 / 2) β of 86 min were observed. The molecular biodistribution time for ricin following oral ingestion was estimated using an antibody neutralization assay. Ricin was detected in the blood stream starting at approximately 6 - 7 h post- oral intoxication. Whole animal histopathological analysis was performed on mice treated orally or systemically with ricin.

In the current study, the optimal phenol concentration and duration of intralesional exposure were evaluated. Specimens of GCTs were exposed to various concentrations of phenol solution (6, 60 and 80 %) for either 1 or 3 min. Following embedding in glutaraldehyde, the tumour cell layers were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Destroyed cell organelles indicated the penetration depth as a sign of denaturation. Incubation of GCT specimens with 6 % phenol solution for 3 min resulted in the most tissue damage and the deepest tissue penetration of ~ 200 µm. Incubation with 60 and 80 % phenol solution reached a penetration depth of only ~ 100 µm.

One group of schoolchil-dren was reexamined after six months, and levels of antitoxin in serum were cor-related with the presence of C. diphtheriae in skin lesions and throat cultures.

Strain NCTC 8237 produced ninefold higher PLC activity than strain 13. The mean LD 50 for the former was 1 log unit lower than that for the latter. Two isogenic strains were constructed from strain 13 : strain 13 (pJIR 418 alpha) (pJIR 418 alpha contains the plc gene), which produced ninefold higher PLC activity than strain 13; and strain 13 PLC-, which showed no PLC productivity at all because of transformation-mediated gene disruption. The mean LD 50 for strain 13 (pJIR 418 alpha) was 1 log unit lower than those for strain 13 PLC- and strain 13. These results indicate that PLC functions as a virulence-determining factor when it is produced in a sufficient amount. Such a difference in LD 50 was also observed between Bacillus subtilis with and without the cloned plc gene. Inoculation of B. subtilis PLC+ intravenously into mice caused marked thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis. Mice inoculated with B. subtilis at 2 LD 50 died because of circulatory collapse.

These conditions may negatively affect the patient’s quality of life and lead to psychosocial stress. Psoriasis can be categorized as mild, moderate and severe conditions. Mild psoriasis leads to the formation of rashes, and when it becomes moderate, the skin turns into scaly. In severe conditions, red patches may be present on skin surface and becomes itchy.

40|$|Hemolytic uremic syndrome, {{the leading}} cause of kidney failure in children, often follows {{infection}} with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and is mediated by the Shiga type toxins, particularly type 2 (Stx 2), produced by such strains. The challenge in protecting against this life-threatening syndrome is to stimulate an immune response at the site of infection while also protecting against Shiga intoxication at distal sites such as the kidney. As one approach to meeting this challenge, we sought to develop and characterize a prototypic orally delivered, plant-based vaccine against Stx 2, an AB 5 toxin. First, we genetically inactivated the Stx 2 active A subunit gene and then optimized both subunit genes for expression in plants. The toxoid genes were then transformed into the Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) cell line NT- 1 by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Toxoid expression was detected in NT- 1 cell extracts, and the assembly of the holotoxoid was confirmed. Finally, mice were immunized by feeding with the toxoid-expressing NT- 1 cells or by parenteral immunization followed by oral vaccination (prime–boost strategy). The immunized mice produced Stx 2 -specific mucosal IgA and Stx 2 -neutralizing serum IgG. The protective efficacy of these responses was assessed by challenging the immunized mice with E. coli O 91 :H 21 strain B 2 F 1, an isolate that produces an activatable variant of Stx 2 (Stx 2 d) and is lethal to mice.

40|$|The B subunit (RTB) of ricin toxin is a {{galactose}} (Gal) -/N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNac) -specific lectin that mediates attachment, entry, and intracellular trafficking of ricin in host cells. Structurally, RTB {{consists of}} two globular domains with identical folding topologies. Domains 1 and 2 are each comprised of three homologous sub-domains (α, β, γ) that likely arose by gene duplication from a primordial carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), although only sub-domains 1 α and 2 γ retain functional lectin activity. As part of our ongoing effort to generate a comprehensive B cell epitope map of ricin, we report the characterization of three new RTB-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). All three mAbs, JB 4, B/J F 9 and C/M A 2, were initially identified based on their abilities to neutralize ricin in a Vero cell cytotoxicity assay and to partially (or completely) block ricin attachment to cell surfaces. However, only JB 4 proved capable of neutralizing ricin in a macrophage apoptosis assay and in imparting passive immunity to mice in a model of <b>systemic</b> <b>intoxication.</b> Using a combination of techniques, including competitive ELISAs, pepscan analysis, differential reactivity by Western blot, as well as affinity enrichment of phage displayed peptides, we tentatively localized the epitopes recognized by the non-neutralizing mAbs B/J F 9 and C/M A 2 to sub-domains 2 α and 2 β, respectively. Furthermore, we propose that the epitope recognized by JB 4 is within sub-domain 2 γ, adjacent to RTB's high affinity Gal/GalNAc CRD. These data suggest that recognition of RTB's sub-domains 1 α and 2 γ are critical determinants of antibody neutralizing activity and protective immunity to ricin...|$|E
