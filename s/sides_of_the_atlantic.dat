5|$|Keynesian {{principles}} fared increasingly {{poorly on}} the practical side of economics – by 1979 {{they had been}} displaced by monetarism as the primary influence on Anglo-American economic policy.

5|$|Leo Ornstein (born Yuda-Leyb Gornshteyn; c. December 11, 1895 – February 24, 2002) (also Лев Орнштейн, Lev Ornchteïn) was a Russian-American {{composer}} and pianist {{of the early}} twentieth century. His performances of works by avant-garde composers and his own innovative and even shocking pieces made him a cause célèbre on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, Lafayette was an {{exponent}} of {{the ideals}} of the Age of Enlightenment, especially on human rights and civic nationalism.

5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s rising shore costs, dock workers strikes, {{restrictive}} practices on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> and subsidised competition from American shipping lines, persuaded Manchester Liners to switch its future fleet to container ships only. An {{example of the}} delaying effect of the strikes in the Canadian ports, with consequent impact on operating costs, was an extended ninety-day return voyage to Quebec City in early 1967 by the new Manchester Progress.|$|E
5|$|Pinafores {{extraordinary}} {{popularity in}} Britain, America and elsewhere {{was followed by}} the similar success of a series of Gilbert and Sullivan works, including The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado. Their works, later known as the Savoy operas, dominated the musical stage on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> {{for more than a decade}} and continue to be performed today. The structure and style of these operas, particularly Pinafore, were much copied and contributed significantly to the development of modern musical theatre.|$|E

In the west, it occurs from southern Nova Scotia to Venezuela and Brazil. It is rare in the North Sea and the Mediterranean and south of North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Having {{purchased}} the film rights to Journey's End, British producers Michael Balcon and Thomas Welsh agreed that Whale's experience directing the London and Broadway productions {{of the play}} made him the best choice to direct the film. The two partnered with a small American studio, Tiffany-Stahl, to shoot it in New York. Colin Clive reprised his role as Stanhope, and David Manners was cast as Raleigh. Filming got underway on 6 December 1929 and wrapped on 22 January 1930. Journey's End was released in Great Britain on 14 April and in the United States on 15 April. On both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> the film was a tremendous critical and commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Even before Carpathia {{arrived in}} New York, efforts were getting {{underway}} {{to retrieve the}} dead. Four ships chartered by the White Star Line succeeded in retrieving 328bodies; 119 were buried at sea, while the remaining 209 were brought ashore to the Canadian port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 150 of them were buried. Memorials were raised in various places– New York, Washington, Southampton, Liverpool, Belfast and Lichfield, among others– and ceremonies were held on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> to commemorate the dead and raise funds to aid the survivors. The bodies of most of Titanics victims were never recovered, and the only evidence of their deaths was found 73years later among the debris on the seabed: pairs of shoes lying side by side, where bodies had once lain before eventually decomposing.|$|E
5|$|Loomis and DuBridge {{recruited}} physicists {{for the new}} {{laboratory at}} an Applied Nuclear Physics conference at MIT in October 1940. Among those who volunteered was Rabi. His assignment was to study the magnetron, which was so secret {{that it had to}} be kept in a safe. The Radiation Laboratory scientists set their sights on producing a microwave radar set by 6 January 1941, and having a prototype installed in a Douglas A-20 Havoc by March. This was done; the technological obstacles were gradually overcome, and a working US microwave radar set was produced. The magnetron was further developed on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> to permit a reduction in wavelength from 150cm to 10cm, and then to 3cm. The laboratory went on to develop air-to-surface radar to detect submarines, the SCR-584 radar for fire control, and LORAN, a long-range radio navigation system. At Rabi's instigation, a branch of the Radiation Laboratory was located at Columbia, with Rabi in charge.|$|E

5|$|Richard Bellingham died on 7 December 1672. He was {{the last}} {{surviving}} signer of the colonial charter, and was buried in Boston's Granary Burying Ground. He was survived by his son Samuel {{from his first marriage}} and his second wife Penelope, who outlived him by 30 years. His landholdings at Winnessimmett became tied up in legal action lasting more than 100 years, and involved court and procedural decisions on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> to resolve. Under the terms of his will, some of his properties in Winnessimmett were set aside for religious uses. His son challenged the will, which was eventually set aside. The litigation continued, carried on by his heirs and succeeding owners and occupants of the properties, and was finally concluded in 1785. The town of Bellingham, Massachusetts is named in his honor, and a number of features in Chelsea, including a square, a street, and a hill, bear the name Bellingham.|$|E
5|$|In August 1940, a British mission, led by Tizard {{and with}} members that {{included}} Cockcroft, {{was sent to}} America to create relations and help advance the research towards war technology with the Americans. Several military technologies were shared, including advances in radar, antisubmarine warfare, aeronautical engineering and explosives. The American radar programme in particular was reinvigorated with an added impetus {{to the development of}} microwave radar and proximity fuses. This prompted the Americans to create the MIT Radiation Laboratory, which would later serve a model for the Los Alamos Laboratory. The mission did not spend much time on nuclear fission, with only two meetings of the subject, mainly about uranium enrichment. In particular, Cockcroft did not report Peierls' and Frisch's findings. Nonetheless, there were important repercussions. A barrier had been broken and a pathway to exchange technical information between the two countries was developed. Moreover, the notion of civilian scientists playing an important role of the development of military technologies was strengthened on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic.</b>|$|E
