40|$|The <b>saturated</b> <b>fluorescence</b> method {{makes use}} of the great {{simplifications}} which occur when under conditions of intense radiation the excitation process becomes saturated. A description is presented of the <b>saturated</b> <b>fluorescence</b> method, taking into account rate equations and saturation, radiative transfer, the two-level system, a multilevel system, and measurements under saturation conditions. The detectability limits of the method are investigated. Fluorescence trapping is found to place an upper limit on the number density of the fluorescing species that can be measured without signal loss.

Pressure shifts in the 9 and 10 pm lasing transition in CO 2 is measured using a two channel 4. 3 p <b>saturated</b> <b>fluorescence</b> stabilized CO 2 laser heterodyne system. These pressure shift measurements are unique because the J dependence and vibrational dependence (relating to the different Fermi resonances in the different CO 2 isotopes) can studied using this <b>saturated</b> <b>fluorescence</b> technique.

Although strongly driven atoms usually present little coherent scattering, we here show that the mirror-assisted version can produce high contrast fringes, for arbitrarily high saturation parameters. The contrast of the fringes oscillates with the Rabi frequency of the atomic transition and the distance between the mirror and the atoms, due to the coherent interference between the carrier and the Mollow sidebands of the <b>saturated</b> resonant <b>fluorescence</b> spectrum emitted by the atoms.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of binding of blood coagulation cofactor factor Va to acidic-lipid-containing membranes has been addressed. Binding isotherms were generated {{at room temperature}} using the change in fluorescence anisotropy of pyrene-labeled bovine factor Va to detect binding to sonicated membrane vesicles containing either bovine brain phosphatidylserine (PS) or 1, 2 -dioleoyl- 3 -sn-phosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) in combination with 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl- 3 -sn-phosphatidylcholine (POPC). The composition of the membranes was varied from 0 to 40 mol% for PS/POPC and from 0 to 65 mol % for DOPG/POPC membranes. Fitting the data to a classical Langmuir adsorption model yielded estimates of the dissociation constant (Kd) and the stoichiometry of binding. The values of Kd defined in this way displayed a maximum at low acidic lipid content but were nearly constant at intermediate to high fractions of acidic lipid. Fitting the binding isotherms to a two-process binding model (nonspecific adsorption in addition to binding of acidic lipids to sites on the protein) suggested a significant acidic-lipid-independent binding affinity in addition to occupancy of three protein sites that bind PS in preference to DOPG. Both analyses indicated that interaction of factor Va with an acidic-lipid-containing membrane is much more complex than those of factor Xa or prothrombin. Furthermore, {{a change in the}} conformation of bound pyrene-labeled factor Va with surface concentration of acidic lipid was implied by variation of both the <b>saturating</b> <b>fluorescence</b> anisotropy and the binding parameters with the acidic lipid content of the membrane. Finally, the results cannot support the contention that binding occurs through nonspecific adsorption to a patch or domain of acidic lipids in the membrane. Factor Va is suggested to associate with membranes by a complex process that includes both acidic-lipid-specific and acidic-lipid-independent sites and a protein structure change induced by occupancy of acidic-lipid-specific sites on the factor Va molecule...|$|R

Experimental data were extracted to validate calculation by CHEMKIN software. Both experiments and CHEMKIN calculation draw one conclusion that NO mole fraction in CH 4 -air flame peaks at stoichiometric and Ï 1. 3, due to thermal NO and prompt NO routes. All mechanisms applied can well-predict the NO mole fraction at the fuel lean side but failed at the fuel rich side. NO mole fraction in syngas flame is propotional to CH 4 ratio as shown in the experimental data, but all the mechanisms failed to predict it with some even having a wrong tendency.

In particular, exciton-exciton annihilation causes the <b>fluorescence</b> intensity to <b>saturate</b> and the <b>fluorescence</b> lifetime to shorten at high exciton densities. In addition, the exciton annihilation, and thus diffusion, coefficients are found to be relatively large, even at low temperatures, indicating that exciton migration is important in PPV. These results indicate that the fluorescent (photoluminescent) state in PPV is excitonic in nature. The results argue against the band model where high mobility at reduced temperatures is not expected because the light-emitting species, neutral bipolarons, are associated with large lattice distortions...|$|R

Photoreductive activities of photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) increased with no apparent lag when degreened cells were exposed to light at 38 [deg]C. However, fluorescence transients induced by actinic light, which reflect the functional state of PSII, changed only slightly during the first 2 h of greening. When these cells were treated with 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethyl urea (DCMU) or <b>saturating</b> light, <b>fluorescence</b> increased commensurate with the cellular content of chlorophyll. In similar experiments with greening cells of C. reinhardtii CC- 2341 (ac-u-g- 2. 3), a PSI-minus strain, fluorescence increased with chlorophyll without treatment with DCMU. These data suggested that fluorescence of initial PSII centers in greening y 1 cells was quenched by activity of PSI.

Rotationally resolved IR action spectra are obtained for trans-HOOO in the fundamental (Î½ OH) and overtone (2 Î½ OH) OH stretching regions at 3569. 30 and 6974. 18 cm - 1, respectively.

40|$|Measurements and {{modeling}} {{of the formation}} of superequilibrium radicals and nitric oxide in atmospheric pressure turbulent jet diffusion flames are presented which quantify the influence of superequilibrium on thermal NOx formation. Variation of fuel gas compositions (CO/H 2 /N 2, CO/H 2 /CO 2, and CO/H 2 /Ar) permits partial separation of chemical and fluid mechanical effects. Superequilibrium OH radical concentrations are measured by single-pulse laser <b>saturated</b> <b>fluorescence</b> and NO and NO 2 concentrations by probe sampling and chemiluminescent detection. Four different types of probes were used to quantify probe sampling effects. In turbulent reaction zones, virtually all of the NOx in the flame occurred in the form of NO but far downstream of the flame nearly half of the NOx occurred as NO 2. Thermal NOx maximized near stoichiometric flame zones; the rich shift observed by others may be a probe sampling artifact. In turbulent CO/H 2 /N 2 jet diffusion flames, both measurements and a nonequilibrium turbulent combustion model show that superequilibrium decreases average temperatures by 250 K, increases average OH concentrations by a factor of 4 - 6, and increases thermal NOx formation principally by broadening the range of mixture fraction (both rich and lean) where thermal NOx is formed. Calculated increases in thermal NOx due to superequilibrium in turbulent CO/H 2 /N 2 jet diffusion flames are factors of 2. 5 at 1 atm and 1. 4 at 10 atm.

40|$|International audienceFar-field optical {{microscopy}} using focused light {{is an important}} tool {{in a number of}} scientific disciplines including chemical, (bio) physical and biomedical research, particularly with respect to the study of living cells and organisms. Unfortunately, the applicability of the optical microscope is limited, since the diffraction of light imposes limitations on the spatial resolution of the image. Consequently the details of, for example, cellular protein distributions, can be visualized only to a certain extent. Fortunately, recent years have witnessed the development of 'super-resolution' far-field {{optical microscopy}} (nanoscopy) techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED), ground state depletion (GSD), reversible <b>saturated</b> optical (<b>fluorescence)</b> transitions (RESOLFT), photoactivation localization microscopy (PALM), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), structured illumination microscopy (SIM) or saturated structured illumination microscopy (SSIM), all {{in one way or another}} addressing the problem of the limited spatial resolution of far-field optical microscopy. While SIM achieves a two-fold improvement in spatial resolution compared to conventional optical microscopy, STED, RESOLFT, PALM/STORM, or SSIM have all gone beyond, pushing the limits of optical image resolution to the nanometer scale. Consequently, all super-resolution techniques open new avenues of biomedical research. Because the field is so young, the potential capabilities of different super-resolution microscopy approaches have yet to be fully explored, and uncertainties remain when considering the best choice of methodology. Thus, even for experts, the road to the future is sometimes shrouded in mist. The super-resolution optical microscopy roadmap of Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics addresses this need for clarity. It provides guidance to the outstanding questions through a collection of short review articles from experts in the field, giving a thorough discussion on the concepts underlying super-resolution optical microscopy, the potential of different approaches, the importance of label optimization (such as reversible photoswitchable proteins) and applications in which these methods will have a significant impact...|$|R
40|$|A two laser {{technique}} {{is used to}} study laser-particle interactions and the disintegration of soot by high power UV light. Two separate 20 ns laser pulses irradiate combustion generated soot nanoparticles with 193 nm photons. The first laser pulse, from 0 to 14. 7 J/cm{sup 2 }, photofragments the soot particles and electronically excites the liberated carbon atoms. The second laser pulse, held constant at 13 J/cm{sup 2 }, irradiates the remaining particle fragments and other products of the first laser pulse. The atomic carbon fluorescence at 248 nm produced by the first laser pulse increases linearly with laser fluence from 1 to 6 J/cm{sup 2 }. At higher fluences, the signal from atomic carbon signal <b>saturates.</b> The carbon <b>fluorescence</b> from the second laser pulse decreases as the fluence from the first laser increases, ultimately approaching zero as first laser fluence approaches 10 J/cm{sup 2 }, suggesting that the particles fully disintegrate at high laser fluences. We use an energy balance parameter, called the photon-atom ratio (PAR), to aid in understanding laser-particle interactions. These results help define the regimes where photofragmentation fluorescence methods quantitatively measure total soot concentrations...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) -induced fusion between intact human erythrocytes was {{continuously monitored}} by a fluorescence lipid mixing method, utilizing the dequenching of the fluorescence probe, 1 -oleoyl- 2 -[12 -[(7 -nitro- 2, 1, 3 -benzoxadiazol- 4 -yl) amino]dodecanoyl] phosphatidylcholine (C 12 -NBD-PC). The steady-state fluorescence intensity was detected {{from the surface}} of cells in a monolayer on an alcian blue-coated glass coverslip. The relief of fluorescence self-quenching after fusion between C 12 -NBD-PC labeled and unlabeled intact erythrocytes was measured. The extent of fluorescence dequenching was normalized based on the measured concentration of probes in membranes, the projected partial dequenching due both to dilution by intercellular fusion, and the dilution between the inner and outer leaflets of membranes (flip-flop). There was no significant increase in fluorescence intensity during PEG treatment of 5 min, at 4 degrees C. Intensity increased immediately after the dilution of PEG, and reached saturation in 30 min. The efficiency of fusion increased with the increasing of PEG concentrations. Only 4 % enhancement of <b>saturated</b> relative <b>fluorescence</b> intensity was detected in 25 wt% PEG-induced cell fusion; 23 % enhancement in 30 wt%; and 66 % enhancement in 35 wt%. The transfer of fluorescent probes between membrane bilayer leaflets (flip-flop) was also monitored during the fusion process. Flip-flop was monitored in confluent monolayers as well as in isolated cells. There was no significant spontaneous flip-flop within 30 min of dilution. The relative fluorescence intensity enhancement contributed by the dilution of probes between fused labeled and unlabeled cells (at a 1 : 1 ratio) was found to account for only 39 % of the observed final dequenching, whereas the contribution by flip-flop associated with cell fusion was found to account for 9 %, and flip-flop without fusion contributed approximately 18 %. A portion of the flip-flop is a consequence of hemolysis. Therefore, fluorescence dequenching measurements of fusion of whole cells must be interpreted with caution...|$|R
