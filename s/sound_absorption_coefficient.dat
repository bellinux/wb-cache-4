A V-shaped acoustic wave-guide with the two branches forming a 45 degree angle from the horizontal direction was designed to measure the <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> of installed trim materials.

In this investigation, the influences of two kinds of polymer matrix (Polypropylene and Urea-formaldehyde) and two kinds of natural fibers (rice straw and kenaf) were studied for <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Four samples of novel sound absorbers were made with different matrix and fibers composition, Sample 1 and 2 was made of rice straw reinforced with polypropylene and Urea-formaldehyde and Sample 3 and 4 was made with kenaf fiber reinforced with polypropylene and Urea-formaldehyde matrix. <b>Sound</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> were measured at frequencies from 300 Hz to 2000 Hz.
