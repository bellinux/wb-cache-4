40|$|The flow of a thin viscous film {{under the}} {{influence}} of a surface active agent (surfactant) is described by a system of degenerate parabolic equations. A robust and effective numerical scheme based on a finite volume discretization in space and a suitable operator splitting in time is presented. The convective part, which models the effects of Marangoni forces, is treated by an higher order explicit up-wind scheme with a limited linear reconstruction. For the fourth order parabolic part, which corresponds to the classical thin film problem, we formulate a finite volume scheme that entails the <b>same</b> conservation <b>properties</b> <b>continuous</b> solutions have, i. e. energy and entropy estimates. The scheme and the fundamental estimates are derived in the relevant 2 D case. Numerical simulations and the convergence result are currently restricted to 1 D...|$|R

In general case, we proved a <b>continuous</b> <b>property</b> from below and a lower semi-continuous property of the minimal super-solution of CBSDE in its effective domain.

30|$|From Definition 1, {{the generic}} {{framework}} {{we are seeking}} requires an ontological representation that can achieve CG distribution over properties whose value spaces are continuous. In this pursuit, all continuous quantities in the domain should have multivariate Gaussian distributions, i.e. CG, of the type CondG. Thus, for each <b>property</b> with a <b>continuous</b> value space in ontology, we specify two types of distributions: discrete distribution over an equivalent property that has a discrete value space of the continuous domain; and a CG distribution over the continuous value space of the property. This fictitious (equivalent) discrete property serves as the sole parent of the <b>continuous</b> <b>property</b> in the equivalent DAG of HyProb-Ontology. The fictitious discrete property hereby replaces the <b>continuous</b> <b>property</b> in all dependencies in the ontology, and its representation follows those of the discrete setting.|$|R

Generally, the strict comparison theorem does not hold under such nonlinear expectations any more, but we can still modify the classical method to find out an optimal stopping time via <b>continuous</b> <b>property.</b> The mainly used theory in our paper is the monotonic limit theorem of BSDE and nonlinear decomposition theorem of Doob-Meyer's type developed by Peng S.
