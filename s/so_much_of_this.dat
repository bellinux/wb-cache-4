25|$|Rather than {{encouraging}} mutli-national {{businesses to}} meet the needs of the poor, some organizations such as iDE, the World Resources Institute, and the United Nations Development Programme began to focus on working directly with helping bottom-of-the-pyramid populations become local, small-scale entrepreneurs. Since <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> population is engaged in agriculture, these NGOs have addressed market gaps that enable small-scale (i.e., plots less than 2 hectares) farmers to increase their production and find markets for their harvests. This is done by increasing the availability of farming equipment (e.g., pumps, tillers, seeders) and better quality seed and fertilizer, as well as expanding access for training in farming best practices (e.g., crop rotation).|$|E
500|$|Partially as {{a result}} of his {{association}} with British Dissenters, Johnson became involved in publishing tracts and sermons in defence of the American revolutionaries. He began with Priestley's Address to Protestant Dissenters of All Denominations, on the Approaching Election of Members of Parliament (1774), which urged Dissenters to vote for candidates that guaranteed the American colonists their freedom. Johnson continued his series of anti-government, pro-American pamphlets by publishing Fast Day sermons by Joshua Toulmin, George Walker, Ebenezer Radcliff, and Newcome Cappe. Braithwaite describes these as [...] "well-articulated critiques of government" [...] that [...] "were not only unusual but potentially subversive and disruptive", and she concludes that Johnson's decision to publish <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> material indicates that he supported the political position it espoused. Moreover, Johnson published what Braithwaite calls [...] "probably the most influential English defence of the colonists", Richard Price's Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty (1776). Over 60,000 copies were sold in a year. In 1780 Johnson also issued the first collected political works of Benjamin Franklin in England, a political risk as the American colonies were in rebellion by that time. Johnson did not usually reprint colonial texts—his ties to the revolution were primarily through Dissenters. Thus, the works published by Johnson emphasized both colonial independence and the rights for which Dissenters were fighting—"the right to petition for redress of grievance, the maintenance and protection of equal civil rights, and the inalienable right to liberty of conscience".|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""No One" [...] may have given us a bloodless siege, but {{there were plenty of}} bloody moments, namely from the {{brothers}} Clegane, who were both awesomely brutal this week. Though not against one another, as it looks like, for now, the Cleganebowl's been canceled. I loved the end of Arya's arc along with Jaime's scheme to take Riverrun - though I'm curious to see what comes of the Tully angle. Brienne failed to get an army for Sansa and Jaime's just going to head back home now? It seems like there should be more to this that him just winning one for the Lannister name. Though regardless of what the payoff might be, it was still good to see how <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> story tied back to the first three seasons and Jaime's time as Catelyn's prisoner." [...] He gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club criticized the episode's momentum within the season, writing [...] "The lack of momentum driving these stories is surprising to me given that the season has largely been doing a fine job with internal momentum." [...] McNutt continued, [...] "The show may have run into an unfortunate convergence of so many anti-climactic storylines in a single episode, but their very existence is a necessary byproduct of a narrative that is preparing to shed its skin and move forward with a new lease on life." [...] Despite this, he gave the episode a grade of B-. Erik Kain of Forbes wrote about the episode, [...] "Not the greatest episode of the season, but I still didn't want it to end. Sometimes I realize that even an episode I have lots of complaints about manages to be some of the best television out there. Game of Thrones isn't always on the money, but even an off night can be surprisingly good." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly summarized the episode in his review by saying [...] "Cheers, chills, and the sound of online fan theories imploding. [...] "No One" [...] delivered Jaime Lannister's finest scene in years, a thrilling chase, and set one Stark on an exciting new path." ...|$|E

50|$|The first {{hereditary}} Count Palatine of the Rhine was Conrad, {{a member}} of the House of Hohenstaufen and younger half-brother of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The territories attached to this hereditary office in 1156 started from those held by the Hohenstaufens in the Donnersberg, Nahegau, Haardt, Bergstraße and Kraichgau regions (other branches of the Hohenstaufens received lands in the Duchy of Swabia, Franche-Comté, and <b>so</b> forth). <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> was from their imperial ancestors, the Salian emperors, and apart from Conrad's maternal ancestry, the Counts of Saarbrücken. These backgrounds explain the composition of Upper and Rhenish Palatinate in the inheritance centuries onwards. About 1182, Conrad moved his residence from Stahleck Castle near Bacharach up the Rhine River to Heidelberg.|$|R
