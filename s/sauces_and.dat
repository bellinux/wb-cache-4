5|$|Le Guide Culinaire deemphasized the use {{of heavy}} <b>sauces</b> <b>and</b> leaned toward lighter fumets, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose {{function}} is {{to add to the}} flavor of the dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy <b>sauces</b> <b>and</b> ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Carême, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's Viander, which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of haute cuisine.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} shape, injera compares to the French crêpe and the Indian dosa as a flatbread cooked {{in a circle}} and used as a base for other foods. The taste and texture, however, are unlike the crêpe and dosa, and more similar to the South Indian appam. The bottom surface of the injera, which touches the heating surface, will have a {{relatively}} smooth texture, while the top will become porous. This porous structure allows the injera to be a good bread to scoop up <b>sauces</b> <b>and</b> dishes.|$|E

In the deep south like Rio Grande do Sul, the influence shifts more towards gaúcho traditions shared with its neighbors Argentina and Uruguay, with many meat based products, due to this region livestock based economy – the churrasco, a kind of barbecue, is a local tradition.|$|E
