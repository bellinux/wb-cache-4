DRAM integrated circuits (ICs) produced from the early 1970s to mid-1990s used an asynchronous interface, in which input control signals have a direct effect on internal functions only delayed by the trip across its semiconductor pathways. SDRAM has a <b>synchronous</b> <b>interface,</b> whereby changes on control inputs are recognised after a rising edge of its clock input.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an algebra of <b>synchronous</b> {{scheduling}} <b>interfaces</b> which combines the expres-siveness of Boolean algebra for logical and functional behaviour with the min-max-plus arithmetic for quantifying the non-functional aspects of <b>synchronous</b> <b>interfaces.</b> The interface theory arises from a realisability interpretation of intuitionistic modal logic (also known as Curry-Howard-Isomorphism or propositions-as-types principle). The resulting algebra of interface types aims to provide a general setting for specifying type-directed and compositional analyses of worst-case scheduling bounds. It covers synchronous control flow under concurrent, multi-processing or multi-threading execution and permits precise statements about exactness and coverage of the analyses supporting a variety of abstractions. The paper illustrates the expressiveness of the algebra by way of some examples taken from network flow problems, shortest-path, task scheduling and worst-case reaction times in synchronous programming. ...|$|R

In this paper we provide a theory of relational interfaces, where such input-output relations can be captured. Our theory supports synchronous interfaces, both stateless and stateful. It includes explicit notions of environments and pluggability, and satisfies fundamental properties such as preservation of refinement by composition, and characterization of pluggability by refinement.

40|$|Suppose one has {{a system}} that has a <b>synchronous</b> <b>{{interface}}</b> with its environment. Now, suppose that one refines this system and changes its interface to an asynchronous one. Whatever is meant here by refinement, it cannot be standard (process) refinement since the interface actions have changed; nor is it action refinement in the sense that a process is substituted for an action, as the intention presumably is to allow the system to proceed without having to wait until the environment is willing to synchronize. In this paper we propose a notion of interface refinement of which changing synchronous to asynchronous communication is an instance; as is in fact the reverse change. This notion of interface refinement is quite powerful; it generalizes all existing methods w. r. t. the class of interface changes that it allows. The major part of the paper is concerned with developing proof rules with which to verify interface refinement. We use (linear) temporal logic as specification language and an adaptation of the Manna-Pnueli verification framework.
