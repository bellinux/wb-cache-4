40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{technique}} that combines logic resynthesis and linear placement {{in order to}} alleviate routing congestion in bit-sliced layout. In this approach, we restructure the logic using an intermediate placement solution and then adjust the placement to match the new logic structure. This ability to change logic structure during layout allows us to obtain channel density reductions that are not possible by physical design operations such as lateral <b>shifting,</b> <b>pin</b> permutation, and channel routing. Parts on an industrial chip have been re-synthesized using a prototype program implementing these ideas {{with an average of}} 11. 2 % reduction in bit slice area compared to the original designs. 1 Introduction One of the critical problems encountered in the design of today's VLSI circuits is optimization of the interconnect.

40|$|Plants can {{be adapted}} to the {{changing}} environments through tropic responses, such as light and gravity. One of them is root negative phototropism, which is needed for root growth and nutrient absorption. Here, we show that the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED (PIN) 1 is involved in asymmetric auxin distribution and root negative phototropism. In darkness, PIN 1 is internalized and localized to intracellular compartments; upon blue light illumination, PIN 1 relocalize to basal plasma membrane in root stele cells. The <b>shift</b> of <b>PIN</b> 1 localization induced by blue light is involved in asymmetric auxin distribution and root negative phototropic response. Both blue-light-induced PIN 1 redistribution and root negative phototropism is mediated by a BFA-sensitive trafficking pathway and the activity of PID/PP 2 A. Our results demonstrate that blue-light-induced PIN 1 redistribution participate in asymmetric auxin distribution and root negative phototropism...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} experimentally the modulation of the Schottky {{barrier height}} (SBH) of metal/TaN/n-Ge junctions by varying the TaN thickness in a dual stacked metal layer. The effective SBH for the metal/TaN/n-Ge Schottky junctions, originally pinned at 0. 53 - 0. 61 eV, decays to 0. 44 eV, the barrier height of TaN/n-Ge, {{with an increase}} in the TaN thickness from 0 to 10 nm, independent of the type of metal. Dipole formation at the TaN/Ge interface is proposed to alleviate the metal-induced gap states and <b>shift</b> the <b>pinning</b> level toward the conduction band. The modulation of the SBH can be ascribed to the interdiffusion between the cap metals (Al, Fe, and Ni) and TaN.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the analysis, design, and characterization of a wideband 90 º phase switch in Ka-band. The phase switch {{is based on}} two microstrip bandpass filters in which the commutation is performed by a novel single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switch. The analysis of π-network bandpass filters is provided, obtaining the phase difference and amplitude imbalance between filters and their scattering parameters; tested results show an average phase difference of 88. 9 º ± 5 º and an amplitude imbalance of 0. 15 dB from 24 to 37 GHz. The new broadband SPDT switch {{is based on a}} coplanar waveguide-to-slotline-to-microstrip structure, which enables a full planar integration with <b>shifting</b> branches. <b>PIN</b> diodes are used to perform the switching between outputs. The SPDT shows isolation better than 19 dB, insertion loss of around 1. 8 dB, and return loss better than 15 dB. The full integration of the phase switch achieves a return loss better than 11 dB and insertion loss of around 4 dB over the band 26 – 36 GHz, with an average phase difference of 87. 1 º ± 4 º and an average amplitude imbalance of 0. 3 dB. It provides an excellent performance for this frequency range, suitable for radio-astronomy receivers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{membrane}} disruption {{mechanism of}} pandinin 1 (pin 1), an antimicrobial peptide {{isolated from the}} venom of the African scorpion, was studied using 31 P, 13 C, 1 H solid-state and multidimensional solution-state NMR spectroscopy. A high-resolution NMR solution structure of pin 1 showed that the two distinct α-helical regions move around the central hinge region, which contains Pro 19. 31 P NMR spectra of lipid membrane {{in the presence of}} pin 1, at various temperatures, showed that pin 1 induces various lipid phase behaviors depending on the acyl chain length and charge of phospholipids. Notably, it was found that pin 1 induced formation of the cubic phase in shorter lipid membranes above Tm. Further, the 13 C NMR spectra of pin 1 labeled at Leu 28 under magic angle spinning (MAS) indicated that the motion of pin 1 bound to the lipid bilayer was very slow, with a correlation time of the order of 10 − 3 s. 31 P NMR spectra of dispersions of four saturated phosphatidyl-cholines in the presence of three types of pin 1 derivatives, [W 4 A, W 6 A, W 15 A]-pin 1, pin 1 (1 - 18), and pin 1 (20 - 44), at various temperatures demonstrated that all three pin 1 derivatives have a reduced ability to trigger the cubic phase. 13 C chemical <b>shift</b> values for <b>pin</b> 1 (1 - 18) labeled at Val 3, Ala 10, or Ala 11 under static or slow MAS conditions indicate that pin 1 (1 - 18) rapidly rotates around the average helical axis, and the helical rods are inclined at ∼ 30 ° to the lipid long axis. 13 C chemical <b>shift</b> values for <b>pin</b> 1 (20 - 44) labeled at Gly 25, Leu 28, or Ala 31 under static conditions indicate that pin 1 (20 - 44) may be isotropically tumbling. 1 H MAS chemical shift measurements suggest that pin 1 is located at the membrane-water interface approximately parallel to the bilayer surface. Solid-state NMR results correlated well with the observed biological activity of pin 1 in red blood cells and bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive {{correction}} {{on large}} ground-based telescopes is enabling {{a variety of}} novel studies that would be impossible at the limits of spatial and spectral resolution imposed by the Earth’s turbulent atmosphere. Even relatively high-order systems, however, do not yield a perfect correction {{and as a result}} are compromised by a low-intensity halo of remnant light that is removed from the core of the point-spread function (PSF) and dispersed in the focal plane. Worse still, this halo is neither constant in time nor uniform in position but is concentrated in transient spots that move about as mutually coherent patches of phase over the telescope aperture happen to combine constructively in the image plane. These “speckles ” in the PSF set limits on ground-based searches for faint companions to bright stars. We describe here simple properties of the physics of speckle formation that will affect the statistics of residual speckles in a fundamental way: at high correction, the secondary maxima of the static PSF will coherently amplify or “pin ” the time-varying speckles, influencing their effective characteristic lifetimes and dramatically changing their spatial distribution. Furthermore, as a result of speckle pinning, temporal variations in the noncommon path errors that occur in practical adaptive optics systems will cause an additional gradual drift in the spatial distribution of speckles, as Airy rings <b>shift.</b> Speckle <b>pinning</b> may be exploited to suppress speckle noise by tailoring the PSF with static aberrations artificially injected via the deformable mirror so as to clear a region of the PSF of Airy rings and hence of pinned speckles, a technique that we term “speckle sweeping. ” Subject headings: instrumentation: adaptive optics — turbulence 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{principles}} underlying plant {{development are}} extended {{to allow a}} more molecular mechanism to elaborate the schema by which ground cells differentiate into vascular cells. Biophysical considerations dictate that linear dynamics are not sufficent to capture facilitated auxin transport (e. g., through PIN). We group these transport facilitators into a non-linear model {{under the assumption that}} they attempt to minimize certain differences of auxin concentration. This Constant Gradient Hypothesis greatly increases the descriptive power of our model to include complex dynamical behaviour. Specifically, we show how the early pattern of PIN 1 expression appears in the embryo, how the leaf primordium emerges, how convergence points arise on the leaf margin, how the first loop is formed, and how the intricate pattern of <b>PIN</b> <b>shifts</b> during the early establishment of vein patterns in incipient leaves of Arabidopsis. Given our results, we submit that the model provides evidence that many of the salient structural characteristics that have been described at various stages of plant development can arise from the unifor...|$|R
40|$|The {{levitation}} and pinning force {{properties of}} nanocrystalline MgB 2 superconductors prepared by a mechanical alloying technique with varying milling duration have been investigated. Levitation force measurements under zero-field-cooled regime {{were carried out}} at different temperatures (16, 25 and 30 K) {{as a function of}} the gap between bottom surface of the superconductor and the top surface of a cylindrical Nd-Fe-B permanent magnet whose diameter and height are 30 mm. An increase in the levitation force was observed due to the decrease in particle size caused by increasing the milling time. It was determined the levitation force of the sample milled for 72 h was higher than that milled for 24 h at the same measurement temperature. This is indicative of an enhancing flux pinning capability at the grain boundaries of the MgB 2. Also, it was observed that the pinning properties of the superconductor <b>shifted</b> from surface <b>pinning</b> to normal point pinning above Bmax when the milling time was increased from 24 to 72 h. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|The rate, polarity, and {{symmetry}} {{of the flow}} of the plant hormone auxin are determined by the polar cellular localization of PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers. Flavonoids, a class of secondary plant metabolites, have been suspected to modulate auxin transport and tropic responses. Nevertheless, the identity of specific flavonoid compounds involved and their molecular function and targets in vivo are essentially unknown. Here we show that the root elongation zone of agravitropic pin 2 /eir 1 /wav 6 /agr 1 has an altered pattern and amount of flavonol glycosides. Application of nanomolar concentrations of flavonols to pin 2 roots is sufficient to partially restore root gravitropism. By employing a quantitative cell biological approach, we demonstrate that flavonoids partially restore the formation of lateral auxin gradients in the absence of PIN 2. Chemical complementation by flavonoids correlates with an asymmetric distribution of the PIN 1 protein. pin 2 complementation probably does not result from inhibition of auxin efflux, as supply of the auxin transport inhibitor N- 1 -naphthylphthalamic acid failed to restore pin 2 gravitropism. We propose that flavonoids promote asymmetric <b>PIN</b> <b>shifts</b> during gravity stimulation, thus redirecting basipetal auxin streams necessary for root bending...|$|R
40|$|Pinholes in tunnel {{barriers}} are {{detrimental to the}} performance of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) since they create direct magnetic exchange coupling between the free and pinned magnetic films and may act as current short circuits. A simple and straightforward technique which enables observation of pinholes and distinguishes pinhole coupling from orange-peel coupling would aid greatly in optimizing the performance of MTJs. However, the existing methods for this determination are quite complex and destructive and do not work on complete structures. We have developed a simpler, nondestructive method that works on full MTJ structures which is able to identify whether an observed coupling arises primarily from magnetic exchange coupling through pinholes or from orange-peel coupling. The method is based on the shift in the free layer hysteresis loop at low temperatures. It is well known that the <b>shift</b> in the <b>pinned</b> layer loop at low temperatures is due to the sharp increase of the IrMn pinning strength. If pinholes exist, the free layer loop will also exhibit a shift due to direct exchange coupling. If there are no pinholes, no shift will be observed since orange-peel coupling is magnetostatic and cobalt has essentially no increase in magnetization below 300 K. In this way, a quick diagnosis can be made of whether or not pinholes exist in the MTJ. © 2008 American Institute of Physics. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The native {{defects in}} {{zirconium}} oxide (ZrO 2) and defects at the ZrO 2 /Si interface lead to threshold voltage <b>shifts,</b> Fermi level <b>pinning,</b> {{and various other}} reliability concerns. It is necessary to recognize the origin of these defects and to quantify them. A large number of theoretical reports deal with oxygen vacancy related defect states in the ZrO 2 films; however, the large band gap limits the experimental assessments. In this study, we have deployed Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy to study the deep level defects present in high-kappa ZrO 2 gate dielectrics and at the Si: ZrO 2 interface. The band alignment of the Al/ZrO 2 /Si stack was derived from Ultraviolet Photo electron Spectroscopy measurement to find the exact locations of trap levels. Five deep levels were observed in the band gap of ZrO 2; these are related to different charge states of oxygen vacancies. The activation energies of these trap states {{are in the range}} of 1. 16 - 1. 84 eV from the ZrO 2 conduction band. The capture cross-section of these states was also measured and found to be quite low (10 (- 21) cm(2)). The small value of capture cross-sections is attributed to tunneling events occurring between the energy levels of the bulk and interface. This study would aid in the understanding of numerous fascinating facts witnessed in ZrO 2, such as resistive switching, threshold voltage instabilities, and leakage current problems associated with oxygen vacancy related traps.

Two of the numerical schemes are suited for the simulations of It^o stochastic ordinary di®erential equations (SODEs) and they {{are referred to as}} the stochastic exponential time di®erencing schemes, SETD 0 and SETD 1. The third numerical scheme is a new numerical method we propose for the simulations of Stratonovich SODEs. We call this scheme, the Exponential Stratonovich Integrator (ESI). We investigate numerically the convergence of these three numerical methods, in ad- dition to three standard approximation schemes and also compare the accuracy and e±ciency of these schemes. The e®ect of small noise is also studied. We study the theoretical convergence of the stochastic exponential time di®erencing scheme (SETD 0) for parabolic stochastic partial di®erential equations (SPDEs) with in¯nite-dimensional additive noise and one-dimensional multiplicative noise.

40|$|Superconducting NbTi alloys {{have been}} {{successfully}} fabricated by a simple powder processing route involving ball-milling, pressing and annealing. The microstructure and superconducting properties of the NbTi alloys after each processing step have been characterized and compared to the microstructure and performance of NbTi wire manufactured by a conventional thermo-mechanical process. At {{the early stages of}} milling, a lamellar structure of pure Nb and Ti regions is formed, which is gradually refined by further milling leading to the introduction of a high density of microstructural defects. After 20 hrs milling, diffusion of Ti into the Nb generates a matrix of -Nb- 50 wt%Ti alloy, with a small grain size (50 nm) and high strain (1. 8 %), containing an even distribution of thin Ti flakes (10 - 40 nm).

The Tc (8. 1 K) and Bc 2 (9. 8 T at 4. 2 K) values of this as-milled material are slightly lower than those reported for Nb- 47 wt%Ti due to the impurity content and lattice disorder.
