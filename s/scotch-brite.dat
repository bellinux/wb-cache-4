5000|$|<b>Scotch-Brite</b> {{is a line}} of {{abrasive}} cleaning pads {{produced by}} 3M. The original product line consisted of spun polypropylene fiber with about nine grit variations. <b>Scotch-Brite</b> also contains [...] "Alox", which is a trade name for aluminum oxide. Although polypropylene may be considered benignly soft, its composition with aluminum oxide greatly enhances its abrasive powers; {{to the extent that}} a <b>Scotch-Brite</b> pad will actually scratch glass. Aluminum oxide {{has one of the highest}} hardness coefficients of all oxides, though the much more expensive diamond abrasives still exceed it in hardness.|$|E
5000|$|Repairable and renewable: Cuts and {{scratches}} can be buffed {{out with a}} <b>Scotch-Brite</b> pad or orbital sander.|$|E
5000|$|CleanWell {{has formed}} {{partnerships}} under their [...] "Powered by CleanWellTM" [...] program with Seventh Generation Inc. and 3M's <b>Scotch-Brite</b> Brand [...] {{to introduce a}} line of co-branded disinfectants based on CleanWell's Thyme Oil active ingredient.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Scotch-Brite,</b> {{and similar}} abrasives, have largely {{replaced}} {{the use of}} bronze wool, which had {{been used as a}} non-rusting alternative to steel wool, for use on materials such as oak that would be sensitive to rust.|$|E
50|$|When using Castor Oil it is {{advisable}} {{to clean the}} engine cylinder wall with a <b>Scotch-Brite</b> pad to remove castor oil varnish buildup that will occur, especially after lean running. This buildup of varnish will cause the engine to run inconsistently.|$|E
50|$|Bronze wool {{has largely}} been {{replaced}} now, for cost reasons, by plastic mesh abrasives from makers such as Webrax and 3M <b>Scotch-Brite.</b> These use grains of aluminium oxide or silicon carbide, bonded to a non-woven web of nylon fibres. Like bronze wool, they avoid rust problems.|$|E
50|$|The Scotch {{brand and}} Scotch Tape are {{registered}} trademarks of 3M. Besides using Scotch as a prefix in its brand names (Scotchgard, Scotchlite, and <b>Scotch-Brite),</b> {{the company also}} used the Scotch name for its (mainly professional) audiovisual magnetic tape products, until the early 1990s when the tapes were branded solely with the 3M logo. In 1996, 3M exited the magnetic tape business, selling its assets to Quantegy (which is a spin-off of Ampex).|$|E
50|$|After {{completing}} Economics and Commerce {{studies at}} Harvard University, Landesberg returned to Israel {{and opened a}} factory in Bat Yam. At the time, Sano had only four employees, one machine and three products. In 1963, Sano began selling 3M <b>Scotch-Brite,</b> a move that was profitable. In 1969, the company began producing mosquito repellant, cockroach control, and an air freshener named 'Sano Fresh'. In 1972, the company moved the factory to Hod Hasharon where it has since expanded and operates its main distribution center and factories.|$|E
40|$|The vacuum {{infusion}} {{process has}} been found to be very versatile for making large composite structures. During the resin impregnation process, the vacuum causes the nucleation and formation of air bubbles from gasses dissolved in the resin. One solution to this would be a degassing process prior to infusion. Recent experiments have shown that a degassing process, conducted in batches with a small quantity of a bubble nucleation agent (<b>Scotch-Brite)</b> and an air sparging method could reduce void formation in the vacuum infusion process. At 90 mbar, this method of degassing may remove 40 - 50 % of the dissolved gas. However, despite reducing the level of dissolved gas, some micro-bubbles remain suspended due to the viscosity of the resin and contribute to void formation. While these results were quite encouraging, there is a need to design a system to ensure a continuous supply of degassed resin as a better way forward. In a continuous degassing system, it is necessary to establish the relationship between the degassing process quality and void content reduction from the perspective of strength and performance, besides signifying the most viable method of degassing...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} for a robotized grinding process of aerospace Titanium {{high pressure compressor}} blades was performed. In this process, the blade was grabbed on the robotic arm. A <b>Scotch-Brite</b> grinding wheel, on a pneumatic actuator, was used to grind {{the edges of the}} blades. The objective of this research work was to identify the major factors that influence the accuracy of the process and the final part quality. This objective was achieved by analyzing the dynamic characteristics of the wheel grabbed on the motor as well as analyzing the dynamic characteristics of the blade grabbed on the robotic arm. The frequency response functions (FRF) were identified at different robot configurations and positions. In addition, the vibrations of the various system components during the grinding process were monitored and analyzed to determine the effect of the speed on the relative vibrations between the workpiece and the wheel. Considering the dynamics of the wheel and the motor, rotational speed ranges were recommended. It was found that the vibrations of the grinding process were higher at two ranges: The first corresponds to the first natural frequency of the robot and the second corresponds to the first natural frequency of the wheel and the second natural frequency of the robot. By avoiding these ranges, part quality within the specified tolerances was obtained. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
