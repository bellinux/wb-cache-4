5|$|After his inauguration, Obama {{announced}} {{to a joint}} session of Congress in February 2009 his intent to work with Congress to construct a plan for healthcare reform. By July, a series of bills were approved by committees within the House of Representatives. On the Senate side, from June to September, the <b>Senate</b> <b>Finance</b> Committee held a series of 31 meetings to develop a healthcare reform bill. This group—in particular, Democrats Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman and Kent Conrad, along with Republicans Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe—met for more than 60 hours, and the principles that they discussed, in conjunction with the other committees, became the foundation of the Senate healthcare reform bill.|$|E

Hearings on national health insurance were held in 1971, but no bill {{had the support of}} House Ways and Means and <b>Senate</b> <b>Finance</b> Committee chairmen Representative Wilbur Mills and Senator Russell Long.

5|$|Sereno E. Payne, {{chairman}} of the House Ways and Means Committee, had held hearings in late 1908, and sponsored the resulting draft legislation. On balance, the bill reduced tariffs slightly, but when it passed the House in April 1909 and reached the Senate, the {{chairman of}} the <b>Senate</b> <b>Finance</b> Committee, Rhode Island Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, attached many amendments raising rates. This outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's Robert M. La Follette, who urged Taft to say that the bill was not in accord with the party platform. Taft refused, angering them. Taft insisted that most imports from the Philippines be free of duty, and according to Anderson, showed effective leadership on a subject he was knowledgeable on and cared about.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{expenditures}} quickly strained the government's already fragile {{financial situation}} and Sherman, {{assigned to the}} <b>Senate</b> <b>Finance</b> Committee, {{was involved in the}} process of increasing the revenue. In July 1861, Congress authorized the government to issue Demand Notes, the first form of paper money issued directly by the United States government. The notes were redeemable in specie (i.e., gold or silver coin) but, as Sherman would note in his memoirs, they did not solve the revenue problem, as the government did not have the coin to redeem the notes should they all be presented for payment. To solve this problem, Chase asked for and Congress authorized the issuance of $150 million in bonds, which (as banks purchased them with gold) replenished the treasury. Congress also sought to increase revenue when they passed the Revenue Act of 1861, which imposed the first federal income tax in American history. Sherman endorsed the measure, and even spoke in favor of a steeper tax than the one imposed by the Act (3% on income above $800), preferring to raise revenue by taxation than by borrowing. In August, the special session closed and Sherman returned home to Mansfield to promote military recruitment again.|$|E

5000|$|When the Roman Senate {{introduced}} gold coinage {{either the}} florin or the ducat could have provided an advantageous model to imitate, but the Florentines who controlled the <b>Senate’s</b> <b>finances</b> ensured that their city’s coin was not copied.
