5000|$|In 1977, {{work by the}} Sharp and Roberts labs {{revealed}} that genes of higher organisms are [...] "split" [...] or present in several distinct segments along the DNA molecule. [...] The coding regions of the gene are separated by non-coding DNA that {{is not involved in}} protein expression. The <b>split</b> <b>gene</b> structure was found when adenoviral mRNAs were hybridized to endonuclease cleavage fragments of single stranded viral DNA. [...] It was observed that the mRNAs of the mRNA-DNA hybrids contained 5' and 3' tails of non-hydrogen bonded regions. When larger fragments of viral DNAs were used, forked structures of looped out DNA were observed when hybridized to the viral mRNAs. It was realized that the looped out regions, the introns, are excised from the precursor mRNAs in a process Sharp named [...] "splicing". The <b>split</b> <b>gene</b> structure was subsequently found to be common to most eukaryotic genes. Phillip Sharp and Richard J. Roberts were awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of introns and the splicing process.|$|E
40|$|Growing {{evidence}} indicates that complex intron-rich <b>split</b> <b>genes</b> and an advanced spliceosome existed in the earliest eukaryote, and possibly the first life form. We sought to examine how these <b>split</b> <b>genes</b> could have originated in the prebiotic system. We previously found that split coding sequences for complex proteins occur in abundance in random DNA sequences (P. Senapathy, et al, accompanying paper). This study demonstrates that {{a full complement of}} exons, introns and regulatory and splicing elements could have also occurred inherently within pre-biotic chemistry by chance. By comparing the characteristics of <b>split</b> <b>genes</b> found in computer-generated random genetic sequences with those of several extant eukaryotes, we show that an abundance of intron-rich <b>split</b> <b>genes</b> akin to those present in modern eukaryotes could have existed in the prebiotic system.

Prior research in resolving {{the origin of}} proteins, {{based on the assumption}} that the first genes were contiguous prokaryotic sequences has not succeeded. Rather, it has been established that contiguous protein-coding genes do not exist in practically any amount of random genetic sequences. We found that complex eukaryotic proteins could be inherently encoded in <b>split</b> <b>genes</b> that could exist by chance within mere micrograms to milligrams of random DNA. Using protein amino acid sequence variability, codon degeneracy, and stringent exon-length restriction, we demonstrate that <b>split</b> <b>genes</b> for proteins of extant eukaryotes occur extensively in random genetic sequences. The results provide evidence that an abundance of <b>split</b> <b>genes</b> encoding advanced proteins in a small amount of prebiotic genetic material could have ignited the evolution of the eukaryotic genome...|$|R
50|$|As the {{mechanism}} of splicing is inherently complex, the identification of splicing mutations that cause disease is also difficult. The structure of the eukaryotic <b>split</b> <b>genes</b> is highly complex compared to the simple structure of bacterial genes. The reason for this difference is a major question in eukaryotic biology, as it involves {{the question of how}} the extremely complex eukaryotic genes could have evolved from the simple genes of prokaryotes. Senapathy has formulated a theory based on his Random-sequence Origin of <b>Split</b> <b>Genes</b> model (ROSG) to explain why the genes of eukaryotes are split into short exon and long intron sequences. His research has shown that <b>split</b> <b>genes</b> can easily occur within random DNA sequence whereas contiguous genes of bacteria are extremely improbable to occur. These findings show that eukaryotic genes could have originated from prebiotic genetic sequences, and possibly gave rise to eukaryotic genomes. Senapathy has also shown that splice signal sequences that enable the spliceosome to recognize the splicing junctions originated from the stop-codon ends of Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in random sequence.|$|R

S&S algorithm has also been used in many studies in agricultural plants and animals. Using his <b>split</b> <b>gene</b> theory and S&S algorithm, Senapathy's team has developed analytical platforms and several database resources dedicated to the analysis of split genes, splice junctions, and mutations in several genomes including human, animals and plants. Furthermore, based on the statistics of splice signal sequences, Senapathy has developed a functional genome-wide fingerprinting method.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{bacterial}} genome computational analysis pipeline, called GenVar. The pipeline, {{based on the}} program GeneWise, is designed to analyze an annotated genome and automatically identify missed gene calls and sequence variants such as genes with disrupted reading frames (<b>split</b> <b>genes)</b> and those with insertions and deletions (indels). For a given genome to be analyzed, GenVar relies on a database containing closely related genomes (such as other species or strains) {{as well as a}} few additional reference genomes. GenVar also helps identify gene disruptions probably caused by sequencing errors. We exemplify GenVar’s capabilities by presenting results from the analysis of four Brucella genomes. Brucella is an important human pathogen and zoonotic agent.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{concept that}} all complex life {{evolved from a}} simple bacterium-like life form has been questioned by comparative genomics and proteomics. Several discoveries, including the occurrence of entirely new genes in unexpected life forms without any precursors, and the random mosaic distribution of genes across organisms in higher taxa undermine the principal assertions of this theory. We present {{a new model of}} the pre-biotic parallel evolution of eukaryotic genomes starting with the structurally complex <b>split</b> <b>genes,</b> which are far more probable of supporting biological information and of occurring in random DNA sequences than contiguous genes. By comparing the mosaic patterns of simulated genomes and extant genomes, we show that genomes arising from simulated assembly of random <b>split</b> <b>genes</b> form the same gene distribution patterns observed in extant eukaryotes. This parallel genome origin model eliminates the post-genomic and classical conundrums faced by the linear branching evolution model. |$|R

40|$|The {{standard}} rules of genetic translational decoding are altered in specific genes by different {{events that are}} globally termed recoding. In Archaea recoding has been unequivocally determined so far only for termination codon readthrough events. We study here the mechanism of expression of a gene encoding for a α-L-fucosidase from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (fucA 1), which is split in two open reading frames separated by a - 1 frameshifting.

40|$|Background: A single cultured marine organism, Nanoarchaeum equitans, {{represents}} the Nanoarchaeota branch of symbiotic Archaea, {{with a highly}} reduced genome and unusual features such as multiple <b>split</b> <b>genes.</b> Results: The first terrestrial hyperthermophilic member of the Nanoarchaeota was collected from Obsidian Pool, a thermal feature in Yellowstone National Park, separated by single cell isolation, and sequenced together with its putative host, a Sulfolobales archaeon. Both the new Nanoarchaeota (Nst 1) and N. equitans lack most biosynthetic capabilities, and phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal RNA and protein sequences indicates that the two form a deepbranching archaeal lineage. However, the Nst 1 genome is more than 20 % larger, and encodes a complete gluconeogenesis pathway {{as well as the}} full complement of archaeal flagellum proteins. With a larger genome, a smaller repertoire of <b>split</b> protein encoding <b>genes</b> and no <b>split</b> non-contiguous tRNAs, Nst 1 appears to have experienced less severe genome reduction than N. equitans. These findings imply that, rather than representing ancestral characters, the extremely compact genomes and multiple <b>split</b> <b>genes</b> of Nanoarchaeota are derived characters associated with their symbiotic or parasitic lifestyle. The inferred host of Nst 1 is potentially autotrophic, with a streamlined genome and simplified central and energetic metabolism as compared to other Sulfolobales. Conclusions: Comparison of the N. equitans and Nst 1 genomes suggests that the marine and terrestrial lineages of Nanoarchaeota share a common ancestor that was already a symbiont of another archaeon. The two distinct Nanoarchaeota-host genomic data sets offer novel insights into the evolution of archaeal symbiosis and parasitism, enabling further studies of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of these relationships...|$|R
40|$|By use of {{the nearly}} {{perfectly}} colinear genomes of Rickettsia conorii and Rickettsia prowazekii, we compared the usefulness of three types of sequences for typing of R. conorii isolates: (i) 5 variable coding genes comprising the 16 S ribosomal DNA, gltA, ompB, and sca 4 (gene D) genes, which are present in both genomes, and the ompA gene, which is degraded in R. prowazekii; (ii) 28 genes degraded in R. conorii but intact in R. prowazekii, including 23 split and 5 remnant genes; and (iii) 27 conserved and 25 variable intergenic spacers. The 4 conserved and 23 <b>split</b> <b>genes</b> {{as well as the}} 27 conserved intergenic spacers each had identical sequences in 34 human and 5 tick isolates of R. conorii. Analysis of the ompA sequences identified three genotypes of R. conorii. The variable intergenic spacers were significantly more variable than conserved <b>genes,</b> <b>split</b> <b>genes,</b> remnant genes, and conserved spacers (P < 10 − 2 in all cases). Four of the variable intergenic spacers (dksA-xerC, mppA-purC, rpmE-tRNAfMet, and tRNAGly-tRNATyr) had highly variable sequences; when they were combined for typing, multispacer typing (MST) identified 27 different genotypes in the 39 R. conorii isolates. Two batches from the same R. conorii strain, Malish (Seven), with different culture passage histories were found to exhibit the same MST type. MST was more discriminatory for strain genotyping than multiple gene sequencing (P < 10 − 2). Phylogenetic analysis based on MST sequences was concordant with the geographic origins of R. conorii isolates. Our study supports the usefulness of MST for strain genotyping. This tool may be useful for tracing a strain and identifying its source during outbreaks, including those resulting from bioterrorism...|$|R
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that introns are basically ancient, though intron insertion events can also occur. Introns in the various classes of <b>split</b> <b>gene</b> may have been derived by ‘translational streamlining ’ from ancestral elements formerly performing functional roles in early cells, roles which later became redundant. For example, the exons of structural genes could have originally been small 'minigene ' mRNAs cotranscribed polycistronically, and the spliceosomal introns could formerly have been excised spacers or cleavage sites between the minigene cistrons.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the processing of transcripts of the <b>split</b> <b>gene</b> COB in yeast mitochondrial DNA from cells whose mitochondrial translation was blocked by chloramphenicol for several generations of cell growth. First analysis of transcripts by electrophoresis and RNA/DNA-hybridization clearly showed that cell growth {{in the presence of}} CAP leads to an inhibition of processing yielding an increasing amount of splicing intermediates of the COB transcript and decreasing amounts of the 18 S mRNA coding for apocytochrome b. This observation is in accordance with the now widely favoured idea that mitochondrial proteins are involved in splicing of COB transcripts and that their reduction should hamper processing and - therefore - lead to an accumulation of pre-mRNAs. However, further information obtained by pulse-labeling of pre-mRNA in vivo in the presence of CAP for various times shows that even 30 minutes after addition of CAP a reduction of the processing rate is obtained. Based on these findings we conclude that maturation of mtRNAs is not only dependent on mitochondrial proteins, but also on a more direct interaction of the translation machinery and RNA processing whose nature is so far unknown...|$|E

40|$|The {{veins in}} the Drosophila wing have a {{characteristic}} width, which is {{regulated by the}} activity of the Notch pathway. The expression of the Notch-ligand Delta is restricted to the developing veins, and coincides with places where Notch transcription is lower. We find that this asymmetrical distribution of ligand and receptor leads to activation of Notch on both sides of each vein within a territory of Delta-expressing cells, and to the establishment of boundary cells that separate the vein from adjacent interveins. In these cells, the expression of the Enhancer of <b>split</b> <b>gene</b> m beta is activated and the transcription of the vein-promoting gene veinlet is repressed, thus restricting vein differentiation. We propose that the establishment of vein thickness utilises a combination of mechanisms that include: (1) independent regulation of Notch and Delta expression in intervein and vein territories, (2) Notch activation by Delta in cells where Notch and Delta expression overlaps, (3) positive feedback on Notch transcription in cells where Notch has been activated and (4) repression of veinlet transcription by E(spl) m beta and maintenance of Delta expression by veinlet/torpedo activity.

40|$|The {{assembly}} of functional proteins from fragments in vivo has been recently described for several proteins, including the secreted maltose binding protein in Escherichia coli.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains able to use sucrose produce the enzyme invertase, which is targeted by a signal peptide to the central secretory pathway and the periplasmic space. Using this enzyme as a model we find the following: (i) Polypeptide fragments of invertase, each containing a signal peptide, are independently translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are modified by glycosylation, and travel the entire secretory pathway reaching the yeast periplasm. (ii) Simultaneous expression of independently translated and translocated overlapping fragments of invertase leads to the formation of an enzymatically active complex, whereas individually expressed fragments exhibit no activity. (iii) An active invertase complex is assembled in the ER, is targeted to the yeast periplasm, and is biologically functional, as judged by its ability to facilitate growth on sucrose as a single carbon source.
