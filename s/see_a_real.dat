The official Formula One website (formula1.com) has a live timing JavaScript applet {{that can be used}} during the race {{to keep up with the}} leaderboard in real time. Recently an official application has been made available in the iTunes App Store and on Google Play that allows iOS and Android users to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> time feed of driver positions, timing and commentary. The same official application has been available for Android phones and tablets since 2011.|$|E
25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which {{was not the kind}} of cricket I want to watch. People who pay to see a Test are entitled to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> match, not a tactical tie-up. I think it is a fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E
500|$|Ruiz {{permanently}} {{joined the}} Phillies' roster {{on opening day}} 2007, after eight seasons in the minor leagues. He ultimately [...] "grabbed hold of the top job [...] and never let go". The Phillies signed Rod Barajas before the season {{because of concerns about}} Ruiz's ability to catch, hit, and generally hold up over a full season at the major league level, as seasons there are longer than in the minor leagues. During the season, he honed his confidence and earned the trust of the Phillies' pitching staff, including veteran Jamie Moyer, who commented, [...] "I <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> assuredness to his body language. He's not cocky or brash. He just seems very confident in what's going on." [...] On June 26, Ruiz stole home on the front end of a double steal in an 11â€“4 home win over the Cincinnati Reds, becoming the first Phillie to steal home since Scott Rolen in 1997. [...] He eventually played 115 games over the season, and from then on was the Phillies' regular starting catcher. Statistically, he committed only two errors, which tied for second-best among MLB catchers with at least 100 games played. He had 27 multi-hit games, hit 6 home runs and 51 RBIs with a [...]259 batting average. At the conclusion of the season, he was named to the Topps All-Star Rookie Team.|$|E
