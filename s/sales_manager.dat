40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a study {{conducted}} to examine the problem attributions of <b>sales</b> <b>managers.</b> Research propositions are developed that suggest <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> tend to incorrectly attribute the causes of problems.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{research}} a <b>sales</b> <b>manager’s</b> social network and demonstrate that <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> who are central in closure structures of an advice network achieve high sales performance. Considering the results obtained and the discussion provided in the hypotheses presentation, we argue that <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> must have accurate perceptions of their network. Two different networks were analyzed: friendship and advice; and we also considered two different views of network structure that claim to make an impact on performance and, to explore this claim, we examined whether <b>sales</b> <b>managers,</b> in order to improve sales performance, develop either a highly cohesive network or one containing structural holes. Census data was collected from over 500 personnel of an agricultural input retailer with 23 divisions. Estimates from a sample of 101 <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> demonstrated, in the advice network, how important a highly cohesive structure is to a <b>sales</b> <b>manager’s</b> performance. These results suggest that firms should encourage contacts among their personnel to disseminate and share technical and commercial information. By stimulating cohesive structures of contacts for the purpose of receiving advice, firms create an environment for <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> to develop relationships of trust in which social norms prevail.

5|$|Brigitte Boisselier (born 1956), {{also known}} as Brigitte Roehr, is a French chemist and Raëlian {{religious}} leader {{best known for her}} claim to have overseen the creation of the first human clone. A native of Champagne-Ardenne, she studied chemistry in France and the United States, earning two PhDs. From 1984 to 1997, she lived near Paris and worked as a research chemist and a <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> for Air Liquide. She embraced Raëlism in 1992; the group was unpopular in France and her conversion led to tensions with those around her. Five years later, she joined Clonaid, a Raëlian organization that sought to clone a human. After her service as their scientific director was publicized, she lost her position with Air Liquide and focused on cloning full-time.|$|E
5|$|Like many veterans, Graf {{initially}} had a {{hard time}} finding work, but his connections in the football community helped him. Herberger introduced Graf to Roland Endler, an electronics manufacturer ("Elektro-Schweiss-Industrie GmbH") from Neuss. Endler also became president of the FC Bayern Munich football club between 1958 and 1962. Endler employed Graf as a salesman in his company, and Graf eventually advanced to branch leader in Baden-Württemberg and <b>Sales</b> <b>Manager.</b> The link to Bayern Munich allowed him to enjoy his long love of football, although his injuries never let him play competitively again. He did however, return to flying, joining the Zürich branch of the Swiss Aero Club in 1951. Shunned by many veterans, he did remain friends with of a number of his former comrades from the JG52, in particular Alfred Grislawski.|$|E
5|$|By then a {{national}} hero, Graf was withdrawn from combat operations and posted to a fighter pilot training school in France before being tasked with the setting up {{of a new}} special unit: Jagdgeschwader 50 (JG50—Fighter Wing 50). Its mission was as a high-altitude unit to intercept the de Havilland Mosquito intruders. In November 1943 Graf returned to combat operations. He was appointed Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of Jagdgeschwader 11 (JG11—11th Fighter Wing) and claimed his last and 212th aerial victory on 29 March 1944. He was severely injured during that encounter and, {{after a period of}} convalescence, became Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG52—52nd Fighter Wing). He and the remainder of JG52 surrendered to units of the United States Army on 8 May 1945, but were turned over to the Red Army. Graf was held in Soviet captivity until 1949. After the war he worked as an electronic <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> and died after a long illness in his home town of Engen on 4 November 1988.|$|E

5|$|In January 1971, Bushnell and Dabney founded Syzygy Engineering as an {{official}} company, now with a cash amount of US$350. They approached Ampex and a prior manager of Dabney's with their prototype, but found no interest. The major arcade game manufacturers were based out of Chicago at the time, limiting their ability to demonstrate their idea to an existing firm. During a dentist appointment in early 1971, Bushnell told the dentist about the game {{and that he was}} looking for a manufacturer; the dentist in turn referred him to another patient of his, Dave Ralstin, the <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> for Nutting Associates in Mountain View, California. Nutting had been founded in 1967 on the basis of Computer Quiz, an analog quiz arcade game, and by 1971 was looking for another hit game. After meeting with Bushnell, Nutting felt that his game was the potential success they needed to replace falling sales of Computer Quiz updates, as they had not had a hit game since. Nutting not only agreed to manufacture the game but also hired Bushnell as their chief engineer, as they had no real engineering team at the time. Furthermore, Syzygy Engineering retained ownership of the game, even though Nutting agreed to give Syzygy space to build the prototype and to manufacture the game once complete. Syzygy would be paid five percent of each cabinet sold. Bushnell negotiated to work on Cosmic Combat outside of normal working hours until it went into production in order to keep it conceptually separate from his new job at Nutting so as to prevent Nutting from later claiming ownership due to paying for time or materials spent building the game. Dabney remained at Ampex until the summer, when he resigned to join Bushnell at Nutting, as he was initially unwilling to leave the stable job he'd worked at for ten years without more proof that the game could be a success.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} an {{informal}} network can itself be {{a basis for}} the increase in a <b>sales</b> <b>manager’s</b> performance. Informal networks create a structure that surpasses the formal hierarchical structure defined by the firm. We concentrated on the advice network and considered two different views of network structure that claim to have impact on performance. To explore this claim, we examined whether <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> develop either a highly cohesive network structure (i. e. Coleman’s view) or one containing structural holes (i. e. Burt’s view) in order to achieve higher sales. We also investigated the matter of tie strength put forward by Granovetter in his seminal 1973 work. Census data was collected from about 500 personnel from an agricultural input retailer having 23 divisions. Estimates from a sample of 101 <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> showed the importance of a highly cohesive structure (degree centrality) for the three measures of <b>sales</b> <b>manager’s</b> performance. The strong ties {{have a positive impact on}} performance, suggesting the importance of building up strong bonds with network contacts. Sales managers’ age, time within the retailer and education also influence performance. These results imply that firms should stimulate contacts among personnel to spread technical and commercial information...|$|R

40|$|Relationships between Marketing <b>Managers</b> and <b>Sales</b> <b>Managers</b> are {{amongst the}} most {{important}} working relationships within modern firms, though to date, these have received little attention in the literature. Our study adds to knowledge of this working relationship by examining the effects of Sales unit power, total interdependence between Marketing and Sales, and the type and effects of the influence tactics employed by <b>Sales</b> <b>Managers</b> in this important CFR. Our results suggest that not all influence tactics are effective in increasing a <b>Sales</b> <b>Manager’s</b> influence within the firm. Also, our findings provide support for the notion that managers of powerful departments {{are less likely to}} spend time and effort using influence tactics to secure peer managers’ cooperation and compliance.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> 2 ̆ 7 expertise in performance evaluation and the format used in the evaluation of sales force (dealership) performance. The basic proposition tested was that as expertise increased, the ability to evaluate personnel would increase. A supplementary proposition tested the effects of information presentation format on the decision making of the <b>sales</b> <b>managers.</b> ^ The results provided partial support for the ability of more expert managers to better evaluate the sales force and good support for the ability of a more concrete decision making format to moderate certain decision making biases. Although the available sample limited the tests which could be performed and caused the inability to test several of hypotheses, more expert <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> were more consistent in their judgments when performance cues were not present, tended to use fewer irrelevant cues and placed more faith in organizational cues than did less expert <b>managers.</b> ^ <b>Sales</b> <b>managers</b> performed the evaluation tasks better when they were provided a more concrete information presentation format. The fundamental attribution error was reduced in 9 of 10 cases where it was present, and managers tended to use more information in the concrete information presentation format, reducing availability biases as well. ...|$|R
