In some cases, fields of research are stagnating for its difficulty in material processing. In this study, we are particularly concerned about the cutting mechanism of Al/SiCp through modeling and simulations on wear rate of the tools. These simulations of tool wear rate and cutting mechanism of Al/SiCp are proved by cutting tests on Al/SiCp with nanocemented carbide tool WC- 7 Co and common cemented carbide tool YG 8. A detailed investigation suggests that the cutting instinct of Al/SiCp is of interrupted cutting process. And the <b>grain</b> <b>loss,</b> less tipping and blade fracture during tool wear results from high frequency intermittent shock by SiC grain. The wear behavior on the tool flank is mainly of <b>grain</b> <b>loss.</b> However, the wear behavior of the rake face is not only of <b>grain</b> <b>loss,</b> but also abrasive wear of WC grain by SiC grain.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore into the {{relationships}} between farmers' post-harvest grain management practices/capacities on the one hand, and liquidity constraints and impending risks on the other, in the context of achieving food security objective at household and national levels. The findings are primarily based on a household survey data from 300 randomly selected major food grain producing peasant households in three rural districts of Ethiopia. Results indicate that farmers perceived post-harvest <b>grain</b> <b>loss</b> as an imminent risk, and that instant sales of grains after harvest are triggered by temporary but immediate liquidity preferences to meet various obligations in the absence of or limited sources of cash other than crops sales, and by an impending risk of post-harvest <b>grain</b> <b>loss</b> and the limited capacity to prevent it. While specific considerations are essential, the general policy implication is that post-harvest grain management needs to be taken on board as a matter of strategic policy concern, not just from the perspective of reducing losses but also from the view point of considering it as a viable and dynamic economic activity in terms of generation of employment, value addition and income linkages. post-harvest, liquidity, risk, <b>grain</b> <b>loss,</b> <b>grain</b> sales, price fluctuations, Crop Production/Industries, Food Security and Poverty, Q 12, Q 13, Q 18,...|$|R

In Experiment 1 there were 4 replicates of the factorial design: (a) 2 grain types (barley, oats); (b) whole grain or processing (milled barley or rolled oats); (c) 2 roughage qualities (Persian clover hay, barley straw); and (d) 2 feeding levels (level 1, 150 g/d of grain, 250 g/d of roughage; level 2, 250 g/d of grain, ad libitum roughage). In Experiment 2, which immediately followed Experiment 1, and aimed to detect carry over effects of previous feeding of barley straw and grain processing, feed levels were either 650 g/d grain or 400 g/d grain with 550 g/d Persian clover hay. Data were analysed by ANOVA. In Experiment 1, processing {{had no effect on}} digestible dry matter intake. The number of whole grains lost per 100 g of fresh faeces and whole <b>grains</b> <b>loss</b> as the % of grain dry matter intake were affected by an interaction between processing and roughage quality.

This calls for attention to reducing these losses through application of the results from agricultural research, use of new farming practices, improvements in management system and repair and renewal of farm machinery. The present study considers the design, development and evaluation of a new pneumatic air reel system {{as a replacement for}} the conventional mechanical reel. To evaluate the new system, laboratory and field tests were conducted.  In the laboratory tests, the air velocity was measured along the fan outlet width at a 10 centimeter interval from the outlet to 40 centimeters away from it, and corresponding curves of air velocity distribution along the fan outlet width were drawn. On the basis of the results, 13 fans were calculated to be required on the cutting platform of a 14 -foot (4. 3 meter) combine. The results from the field tests of mechanical and air reels show that <b>grain</b> <b>losses</b> of air reel during harvesting are less than those of the mechanical reel because the air reel has no mechanical contact with the crop and applies less shock on plant stem than the mechanical reel.

The mechanised thresher was evaluated at various threshing drum speeds (550 rpm, 600 rpm and 650 rpm) and feeding rates (200 kgh– 1, 400 kgh– 1 and 600 kgh– 1). Results showed that threshing was satisfactory at grain moisture content between 16. 9 % w. b. and 18. 0 % w. b. for both rice varieties. Threshing efficiency increased from 94. 6 % to 95. 8 % with {{no significant difference}} observed whereas cleaning efficiency decreased significantly from 84. 2 % to 81. 6 % with increasing feed rate irrespective of rice variety. Again, threshing efficiency increased with increasing drum rotational speed, irrespective of feed rate and rice variety.

Particular {{attention has been paid}} to the storage of cereals and legumes. Throughout the book, simple, low-cost facilities and storage methods have been described, appropriate to the requirements of developing countries. In recent decades significant changes have taken place as a result of increased crop yields, the cultivation of new varieties that are often more susceptible to attack by storage pests than traditional ones, and the spread of new pests. These changes have diminished the effectiveness of established storage systems and there is now a need to adapt traditional practices and develop new alternatives. This handbook provides a practical link between old and new ideas. The effects on stored produce of different climatic conditions such as temperature and relative humidity, are explained. Farm and village level storage containers and buildings are described and illustrated as well as the construction of larger, centralized storage and stacking systems. There are details of the fungi and insects which damage stored crops, together with methods of control by insecticides, fumigation and integrated pest management techniques.
