5|$|While Bembo Book is {{considered}} the superior digitisation, the original continues to offer the advantages of two extra weights (semi- and extra-bold) and infant styles with simplified a and g characters resembling handwriting; its lighter appearance may also be of use on printing equipment with greater ink spread. Cross-licensing has meant that it is sold by a range of vendors, often at very low prices. As an example of this, Fontsite obtained the rights to resell a derivative of the original digitisation, using the alternative name Borgia and Bergamo, upgrading it by additional OpenType features such as <b>small</b> <b>capitals</b> and historical alternative characters. Neither version includes digitisations of the larger size versions of Bembo, which had a more delicate and elegant design.|$|E
5|$|Monotype's 1922-3 design, {{based on}} Jannon's {{work in the}} Imprimerie Nationale, is bundled with many Microsoft products. Its italic, {{faithful}} to Jannon's, is extremely calligraphic, with a very variable angle of slant and flourishes on several lower-case letters. Its commercial release is more extensive than the basic Microsoft release, featuring additional features such as swash capitals and <b>small</b> <b>capitals,</b> although like many pre-digital fonts these are only included in the regular weight. Popular in the metal type era, its digitisation has been criticised for having too light a colour on the page for body text if printed with many common printing systems, a problem with several Monotype digitisations of the period. Monotype's 1933 guide to identifying their typefaces noted the asymmetrical T, the sharp triangular serif at top left of m, n, p and r, and a q unlike the p, with a point at top right rather than a full serif.|$|E

25|$|Some buildings, like Santa Maria in Cosmedin (illustrated above) and {{the atrium}} at San Clemente in Rome, {{may have an}} odd {{assortment}} of columns in which large capitals are placed on short columns and <b>small</b> <b>capitals</b> are placed on taller columns to even the height. Architectural compromises of this type are seen where materials have been salvaged {{from a number of}} buildings. Salvaged columns were also used to a lesser extent in France.|$|E
25|$|Stone {{buildings}} are often ornamented with projecting courses {{which may be}} flat fillets or rounded mouldings. These are sometimes carved with patterns, particularly chevrons. An arched doorway that is set into a thick wall may be deeply recessed, and have three or more bands of moulding around it. Doorways sometimes have colonnettes with <b>small</b> <b>capitals,</b> as are also found on the transoms that divide paired windows. Sometimes capitals and corbels are carved with floral motifs or figures.|$|E

25|$|The {{numerical}} references for the ideograms {{were originally}} devised by Ventris and Bennett, divided into functional groups {{corresponding to the}} breakdown of Bennett's index. These groups are numbered beginning 100, 110, 120 etc., with some provision of spare numbers for future additions; the official CIPEM numberings used today are based on Ventris and Bennett's numbering, {{with the provision that}} three or four letter codes (written in <b>small</b> <b>capitals),</b> based on Latin words that seemed relevant at the time, are used where the meanings are known and agreed. Unicode (as of version 5.0) encodes 123 Linear B ideograms.|$|E
25|$|This gallery holds {{machinery}} {{from the}} last of the hot metal typesetting printshops as used in the newspaper industry. The monotype keyboard produces punched 31-level tape for casting on the monotype caster. The keyboard comprises seven QWERTY arrangements (Roman upper and lower case, bold upper and lower case, italic upper and lower case and <b>SMALL</b> <b>CAPITALS).</b> It is operated by compressed air and produces a wide paper tape that contains perforations that when transferred to the caster give full instructions for each character to be cast. The monotype system was widely used in the commercial printing sector. There is a forme (text lines produced on a Linotype typesetting machine) made up into {{the front page of the}} last edition of the Yorkshire Sports, 2 May 1981. The assembled forme is ready to be moulded and cast into a curved printing plate.|$|E

500|$|The digital {{releases}} of Gill Sans fall into several main phases: releases before 2005 (which includes most bundled [...] "system" [...] versions of Gill Sans), the 2005 Pro edition, and the 2015 Nova release which adds many alternate characters {{and is in}} part included with Windows 10. In general characteristics for common weights the designs are similar, {{but there are some}} changes: for example, in the book weight the 2005 release used circular ij dots but the 2015 release uses square designs, and the 2015 release simplifies some ligatures. Digital Gill Sans also gained character sets not present in the metal type, including text figures and <b>small</b> <b>capitals.</b>|$|E

In {{the little}} lodgings at Holloway, they sat first {{trembling}} for the result, {{and ready to}} burst with excitement when Lady Hilda, up at the unwonted hour of six in the morning, tore into their rooms with an early copy of the 'Times' to show them the Duke's speech, and Sir Edmund's quotations, and the editorial leader in which even that most dignified and reticent of British journals condescended to speak with studiously moderated praise of the immense collection of facts so ably strung together by Mr. Ernest Le Breton (in all the legible glory of <b>small</b> <b>capitals,</b> too,) as to the undoubtedly disgraceful condition of some at least among our London alleys. How Edie clung around Lady Hilda and kissed her! and how Lady Hilda kissed her back and cried over her with tears of happier augury! and how they both kissed and cried over unconscious wondering little Dot! And how Lady Hilda could almost have fallen upon Ernest, too, as he sat gazing in blank astonishment and delight at his own name in the magnificent <b>small</b> <b>capitals</b> of a 'Times' leader. Between crying and laughing, with much efficient aid in both from good Mrs. Halliss, they hardly knew how they ever got through the long delightful hours of that memorable epoch-making morning.|$|E
