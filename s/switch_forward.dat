In {{order to provide}} a cost effective and high density solution for low power applications, this thesis proposes a single stage isolated converter topology designed to achieve a regulated dc output voltage having no low frequency components and a high input power factor. The topology {{is derived from the}} basic two <b>switch</b> <b>forward</b> converter, but incorporates an additional transformer winding, an inductor, and a few diodes. The proposed circuit inherently forces the input current to be discontinuous and ac modulated to achieve high input power factor. The converter's output is operated in discontinuous conduction mode to minimize the bulk capacitor's voltage variations with variations in the output load current. Analysis of the converter is presented and performance characteristics are given. Design guidelines to select critical components of the circuit are presented.

40|$|The {{design of}} an AC to DC converter, which takes line supply as input and {{provides}} a regulated DC output voltage which can be adjusted over a range of voltages is proposed in this project. The main aim {{is to get a}} regulated output voltage for any change in line supply. The line and load regulation is expected to be very less. The cascaded connection of rectifier, converter transformer along with output filter is used. To meet the specification the best suited topology is forward converter topology. A two <b>switch</b> <b>forward</b> converter is used to avoid transformer core saturation. To trigger both the MOSFETs at a time through a single pulse transformer the current mode control PWM IC UC 3844 is used which avoids using an extra current sensing circuit. The converter transformer has one primary and three secondary windings. The three secondary windings serves three purposes, one used provide power supply to control circuit, other used for voltage feedback to control circuit and the third to feed the load. The output voltage is fed back to control circuit through an opto coupler which provides input to output isolation. Two voltage regulators are provided one at power circuit other at control circuit. Once the output voltage is set for a particular value, the voltage regulator at power circuit senses the variation in output voltage for any change in input and sends proportional voltage to the control circuit this is sensed by PWM IC through regulator at control circuit, then the IC will adjust the duty ratio of the triggering pulse to MOSFETs which leads to maintaining constant voltage at the output.

This thesis concentrates on examining the use of label switching techniques for scalable best effort unicast <b>forwarding.</b> Most label <b>switching</b> protocols are capable of operating over cell based switched networks such as ATM, and we constrain this thesis to examining this case. In essence w e examine the implementation of label switching techniques in an Internet wide environment. The aim of this work is to examine ways of maximizing the percentage of packets following label switched paths and therefore reducing the number of packets that require traditional IP forwarding. We concentrate on core Internet routers. There is a significant body of literature proposing and examining implementations several label switching approaches such as: Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), IP Switching, IP Navigator, Aggregate Route Based IP Switching, and Tag Switching. W e present an extensive literature survey. In addition we present a comprehensive classification of label switching techniques to provide scalable best effort IP forwarding in the Internet. From this work we isolate several areas of work for further consideration. Specifically, these areas concern the use of label <b>switching</b> <b>forwarding</b> in future IP networks including: an IP version 6 environment with highly aggregated routing tables; use of label switching in conjunction with congestion sensitive routing; and an optically switched network. The examination of label switching in hierarchical networks examines the impact a high level of IP routing table aggregation that will be associated with IP version 6. We show that the popular MPLS best effort forwarding mechanism will perform poorly in this environment and will require a high level of forwarding in core gateway routers.
