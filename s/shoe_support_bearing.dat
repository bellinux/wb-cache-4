30|$|The wings must, at minimum, be {{supported}} at three locations, two at A and B and a third, “offset,” wing <b>support</b> <b>bearing</b> {{along the line}} AC. In this configuration, the wing <b>support</b> <b>bearings</b> must primarily accommodate rotation, but also some translation. The need for translation {{is caused by the}} fact that paths ADB* and AD*B* in Fig.  6 b are not the same length. One wing <b>support</b> <b>bearing</b> (e.g., the one at A) should be fixed against longitudinal and transverse displacements. The one at B* should then be guided, permitting free longitudinal but not transverse displacement. The offset wing <b>support</b> <b>bearing,</b> along the line AC, must be designed for rotation about the line AC and for some longitudinal and transverse displacement to accommodate possible yaw motions.|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  1, {{in the case}} of the porous <b>supports</b> <b>bearing</b> lipid membranes, LPS was removed to lower than 0.020  ng mL- 1 at pH  5.3, 7.0, and 8.0 and to 0.039  ng mL- 1 at pH  4.3 with a {{quantitative}} recovery of protein. In the case of DEAE-Sepharose CL- 6 B and histidine-immobilized agarose (Table  2), concentrations of LPS in the recovered solution were higher than those in the porous <b>supports</b> <b>bearing</b> lipid membranes. Since the removal of LPS to lower than the detection limit is usually required for pharmaceutical applications, the above removal ability of the porous <b>supports</b> <b>bearing</b> lipid membranes can be an advantage in practical use.|$|R

30|$|Polymeric lipid {{membranes}} of N-octadecylchitosan, {{which consists}} of 70  mol% of 2 -(octadecylamino)- 2 -deoxy-d-glucopyranose, 17  mol% of 2 -amino- 2 -deoxy-d-glucopyranose, and 13  mol% of 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-d-glucopyranose, were covalently immobilized to carboxylated porous supports composed of chitosan and used for the adsorption of pyrogenic lipopolysaccharide. When human serum albumin solution, including 5  mg mL- 1 of albumin and 5.6  ng mL- 1 of lipopolysaccharide, was passed through a column packed with the resulting porous <b>supports</b> <b>bearing</b> lipid membranes assembled in nanoscale, lipopolysaccharide was removed to as low as a detection limit of 0.020  ng mL- 1 with a quantitative recovery of protein. On the other hand, {{in the case of}} directly N-octadecylated porous supports having cationic and hydrophobic ligands which are not assembled as lipid membranes, lipopolysaccharide could not be removed to the detection limit and protein recovery was lower than the porous <b>supports</b> <b>bearing</b> lipid membranes. The difference above as well as difference from conventional adsorbents suggested that the selectivity was attributable to an interaction between the cationic lipid membranes of N-octadecylchitosan and lipopolysaccharide as well as protein. The porous <b>supports</b> <b>bearing</b> lipid membranes were stable in 0.5  M NaOH and 0.1  M HCl at ambient temperature. Considering the confirmed excellent selectivity and chemical stability, their practical use as separation media in the pharmaceutical manufacturing can be expected.|$|R
30|$|Specific {{interaction}} for LPS of the porous <b>supports</b> <b>bearing</b> lipid membranes {{seems to}} be useful in a forthcoming issue. Antibody drugs with superior efficacy have been developed intensively {{in the last few}} decades. However, since they are produced by mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary, their cost is very expensive and needs to be reduced. For this issue, intensive researches have been continued for production of antibody drugs using microorganisms such as E. coli[17]. Although protein A chromatography is useful to recover antibody drugs from preparations, further chromatography is necessary to obtain the required purity for their clinical use. It is likely that production of antibody drugs by E. coli leads to a further requirement of selective removal of LPS. Considering the selectivity for LPS of the porous <b>supports</b> <b>bearing</b> lipid membranes, their application for purification of antibody drugs is interesting.|$|R

The model comprises all rigid body inertial members, <b>support</b> <b>bearings,</b> joints, couplers, and connections between the various engine components, as well as means of vibration damping. The detailed model is parameterized, thus enabling virtual prototype testing of various engine designs, as well as allowing the engine designer {{to carry out a}} comprehensive noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) investigation of engine performance. This new approach in engine design reduces the conceptual design-to-development cycle time and removes the need for extensive engine testing, which accounts for a considerable cost in engine design and development process.

40|$|Vertical {{earthquake}} loading {{is normally}} regarded {{not as important}} as its horizontal components and are not explicitly considered in many seismic design codes. However, some previous severe near-fault earthquakes reveal that the vertical ground motion component can be much larger than the horizontal components and may cause serious damage to the bridge structures. This paper theoretically investigates the vertical pounding responses of a two-span continuous bridge subjected to the severe near-fault vertical ground motions. The bridge is simplified as a continuous beam-spring-rod model. The structural wave effect and the vertical pounding between the bridge girder and the <b>supporting</b> <b>bearing</b> are considered, and the theoretical solutions of bridge seismic responses are derived from the expansion of transient wave functions as a series of eigenfunctions. The effects of vertical earthquake and vertical pounding on the bridge bearing, girder and pier are investigated. The numerical results show that the severe vertical earthquake loading may cause the bridge girder to separate from the <b>supporting</b> <b>bearing</b> and hence result in vertical poundings between them when they are in contact again. These vertical poundings can significantly alter the seismic responses of the bridge structure and may cause severe damage to the bridge components such as bridge girder, <b>supporting</b> <b>bearing</b> and bridge pier. Neglecting the influence of vertical earthquake loading may lead to inaccurate estimation of seismic responses of bridge structures, especially when they are subjected to near-fault earthquake with relatively large vertical motion...|$|R
