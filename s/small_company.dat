Epstein was adamant that the Beatles would not directly endorse any product, but through NEMS Enterprises he would grant discretionary licences to companies {{who were able to}} produce a quality product at a fair price, although many companies were already selling products without a licence.|$|E

Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the exit from the cave and launched another assault along the ravine, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with musketmen, each with a companion sheltering him with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish to break through the pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the exit from the cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege had lasted more than a month, and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of July 8, Lyon opened fire on the Alice Dean, {{intending}} to destroy or disable the steamers. The men had only ever fired the cannon at celebratory events and were unsure how to aim it properly. Two shots were fired, with the second one hitting the upper deck of the McCombs, passing through the ship and landing near {{a group of men}} on the shore, wounding a Confederate. Just as the shelling began Provost Marshal John Timberlake arrived on the scene from Corydon with a <b>small</b> <b>company</b> of reinforcements and assumed command. Timberlake, who was a colonel in the regular army, believed Morgan's force was small, and decided to spare the steamships and instead shell the massed cavalry. Before the cannon could be re-aimed, the superior Confederate artillery was set up and returned fire from their significantly higher position {{on the opposite side of}} the river. The dense morning fog in the valley obliged the Confederates to guess at their target. Their first shot landed short of the Legion's position, and the second shot landed behind them and leveled the cabin. The Legion defenders set off a third shot that had already been loaded into their cannon, and fled into a nearby forest. As they moved up the ridge and into the woods, they became visible to the Confederate artillery who began to shell the forest. One shot struck a log where two of the defenders had stopped to rest. They were mortally wounded while the rest fled into the forest as the Confederates continued to shell the landing.|$|E

Then the entrepreneurs must choose between acquiring economic competences internally or externally, via the social network or the market. The size of the company becomes strongly connected to the competence, since the competence is within the people in the <b>company,</b> therefore, <b>small</b> <b>companies</b> can unlikely maintain all the relevant competence internally. Then <b>small</b> <b>companies</b> can acquire competence externally, the most common external competence source for <b>small</b> <b>companies</b> are audits and accountants, who are important for small businesses when they lack competence in accounting, auditing and taxes. <b>Small</b> <b>companies</b> have different internal characteristics and operate in different environments, which the company both affects and are affected by. How the acquisition of economic competence then occurs in <b>small</b> <b>companies</b> and why it is done this way, is affected by internal and external factors as well as of institutional mechanisms. The purpose with the study is to increase the understanding of small companies’ acquisition of economic competence. This is achieved by identifying small companies’ economic competence acquisition, which internal and external factors affecting it, which institutional mechanisms that affects it and by developing an analytical model for this. The study is of a qualitative nature and has been conducted through interviews with 15 different entrepreneurs in 15 different <b>small</b> <b>companies.</b> The <b>small</b> <b>companies</b> in the study generally acquires all economic competence externally, by purchasing it when necessary via the social network. None of the companies in the study acquires all economic competence internally. This study indicates that the internal factors that appears to affect economic competence acquisition is the entrepreneurs' experience and tolerance for uncertainty, the competence base in the company and the trust that the entrepreneur has for the accountant or auditor. The external factors that appears to affect the economic competence acquisition in <b>small</b> <b>companies</b> is the uncertainty of the companies’ environment, the technological complexity of the economic tasks and the efficiency. The <b>small</b> <b>companies</b> without an auditor in the study mainly seems to be affected by the regulatory pillar when they acquire economic competence, while most of the <b>small</b> <b>companies</b> with an auditor in the study, mainly seems to be affected by the cognitive pillar in their economic competence acquisition. The regulative pillar seems to affect all companies' acquisition of economic competence, but in varying degrees. The small companies' economic competence acquisition {{does not seem to be}} directly affected by normative mechanisms to the same extent as the other two pillars, instead the normative mechanisms tend to mainly have an indirect impact on the competence acquisition, through the internal and external factors. Regulatory and cognitive mechanisms also appears to indirectly affect the acquisition of economic competence in the <b>small</b> <b>companies,</b> through the internal and external factors.
