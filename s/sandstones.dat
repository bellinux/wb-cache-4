5|$|Torridonian <b>sandstones</b> {{were also}} {{laid down in}} this period over the gneisses, and these contain the oldest signs of life in Scotland. In later Precambrian times, thick sediments of <b>sandstones,</b> limestones muds and lavas were {{deposited}} {{in what is now}} the Highlands of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Bedrock in {{the area}} was likely formed by Mazeras <b>Sandstones.</b> Msambweni has an average {{rainfall}} of 55.18 inches a year.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type of rock is greywacke, {{followed}} by other types of <b>sandstones</b> and shales. Landslides and mass wasting are common in this region due to erosion as well as earthquakes.|$|E
50|$|The formation, 4300 feet thick, {{is divided}} into three: Chequamegon <b>Sandstone,</b> Devils Island <b>Sandstone,</b> and Orienta <b>Sandstone.</b> The Chequamegon <b>Sandstone</b> is a red and white <b>sandstone</b> 1000 feet thick. The Devils Island <b>Sandstone</b> is a 300-foot thick, pink-to-white pure quartz sandtone with {{significant}} ripples. The Orienta <b>Sandstone</b> is 3000 feet thick and similar to the Chequamegon <b>Sandstone,</b> but with a higher feldspar concentration.|$|R

5|$|In the Taunton area Permian (295–250 {{million years}} ago) red <b>sandstones</b> and breccia outcrop, while rocks of Triassic age (248–204 million years ago) {{underlie}} much of Somerset and form the solid geology to the Somerset Moors and Levels.|$|E
5|$|In the Taunton area Permian (299–252 {{million years}} ago) red <b>sandstones</b> and breccia outcrop, {{although}} rocks of Triassic age (252–201 million years ago) underlie much of Somerset and form the solid geology of the Somerset Moors and Levels. There are no glacial deposits.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sandstones</b> and coals of the Llewellyn Formation {{are located}} in the {{watershed}} of Eddy Creek. Some drift is located near the creek and reddish shale and sandstone of the Catskill Formation can be seen in this area.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, Reyes et al. (2015) used a low 2.5 pH GLDA chelant to {{experimentally}} investigate its stimulation on high-quartz clean <b>sandstone</b> matrix and high-clay heterogeneous <b>sandstone</b> matrix. The results {{reflected a}} 20 % permeability decrease for the clean <b>sandstone</b> but a 30 % permeability increase for the heterogeneous <b>sandstone.</b> This {{indicated that this}} GLDA/HF chelant is more suitable for <b>sandstone</b> with clay content, but not clean <b>sandstone.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{experiments}} were conducted using Bandera brown <b>sandstone,</b> Berea <b>sandstone,</b> and Bandera grey <b>sandstone.</b> The core plugs of dimensions 1.5 -inch diameter and 3 -inch length were used. For Berea <b>sandstone</b> and Bandera grey <b>sandstone,</b> 3 wt% KCl {{was used as}} a compatible fluid to measure the permeability. However, 5 wt% KCl was used for Bandera brown <b>sandstone.</b> While 15 wt% HCl and fresh water were used as a damaging fluid since they affect the clay minerals in the <b>sandstone.</b> All solutions were prepared in deionized water. The mineralogical compositions of the different <b>sandstone</b> cores are listed in Table  1.|$|R
40|$|Endolithic lichens occur {{commonly}} on Clarens <b>Sandstone</b> in South Africa, {{where they}} significantly {{contribute to the}} weathering of <b>sandstone</b> by means of mechanical and chemical weathering processes. This preliminary investigation reports on the success- ful use of strain gauges in detecting strain differences between <b>sandstone</b> without epilithic lichens and <b>sandstone</b> colonised by the euendolithic lichen Lecidea aff. sarcogynoides Korb. Mechanical weathering, expressed as strain changes, in Clarens <b>Sandstone</b> was studied during the transition from relatively dry winter to wet summer conditions. Daily weathering of <b>sandstone</b> due to {{thermal expansion and contraction}} of colonised and uncolonised <b>sandstone</b> could be shown. Our results show that liquid water in <b>sandstone</b> enhances the mechanical weathering of uncolonised Clarens <b>Sandstone</b> while water in the gaseous phase enhances mechanical weathering of <b>sandstone</b> by euendolithic lichens...|$|R
5|$|The {{bedrock of}} the area {{consists}} of Permo-Triassic <b>sandstones</b> and particularly Triassic mudstones. These old rocks lie beneath sea-level and are invisible beneath drift made up of glacial till deposits and post-glacial colluvium and alluvium deposits; there is a smaller amount of peat.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{exception to}} the above are the fossil-bearing beds of Old Red <b>Sandstones</b> found principally along the Moray Firth coast. The Highlands are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including Loch Lomond and Loch Ness. Some parts of the coastline consist of machair, a low lying dune pasture land.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the deposit, these <b>sandstones</b> are reddish brown, very {{micaceous}} and shaley, sometimes containing calcareous nodules, ferruginous concretions and vegetable wax; above, they are gray and quartziferous. This is the Aye formation, including spiriferida like Cyrtospirifer verneuili, Rhynchonellida as Rhynchonella pugnus and R. boloniensis, some Orthoceras, Orthis striatula or Atrypa reticularis Well-preserved feldspar and mica probably come from wind erosion under a semi-arid climate of mountains present in the Netherlands today and extending to Düsseldorf.|$|E

25|$|<b>Sandstone</b> uranium {{deposits}} {{are generally}} of two types. Roll-front type deposits {{occur at the}} boundary between the up dip and oxidized part of a <b>sandstone</b> body and the deeper down dip reduced part of a <b>sandstone</b> body. Peneconcordant <b>sandstone</b> uranium deposits, also called Colorado Plateau-type deposits, most often occur within generally oxidized <b>sandstone</b> bodies, often in localized reduced zones, such as in association with carbonized wood in the <b>sandstone.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sandstone.</b> <b>Sandstone</b> is durable, yet soft {{enough to}} carve easily. Some <b>sandstone</b> markers are so well {{preserved}} that individual chisel marks are discernible, {{while others have}} delaminated and crumbled to dust. Delamination occurs when moisture gets between the layers of the <b>sandstone.</b> As it freezes and expands the layers flake off. In the 17th century, <b>sandstone</b> replaced field stones in Colonial America. Yorkstone was a common <b>sandstone</b> material used in England.|$|R
5|$|At {{the mouth}} of the Rogue River, along the coast of Curry County, is the Otter Point Formation, a mélange of metamorphosed {{sedimentary}} rocks such as shales, <b>sandstones,</b> and chert. Although the rocks formed in the Jurassic, evidence suggests that they faulted north as part of the Gold Beach Terrane after the Klamaths merged with North America. Oregon's only dinosaur fragments, those of a hadrosaur or duck-billed dinosaur, were found here. In the mid-1960s, a geologist also discovered the beak and teeth of an ichthyosaur in the Otter Point Formation.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{movements}} {{after the}} Carboniferous period {{resulted in the}} up-doming of the area and, particularly in the west, the folding of the rock strata along north–south axes. The region {{was raised in a}} north–south line which resulted in the dome-like shape and the shales and <b>sandstones</b> were worn away until limestone was exposed. At the end of this period, the Earth's crust sank here which led to the area being covered by sea, depositing a variety of new rocks.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica is geologically varied, {{dating from}} the Precambrian era, with some rocks formed more than 3billion years ago. It is {{composed}} of a metamorphic and igneous platform which {{is the basis of}} the continental shield. On top of this base are coal and various modern rocks, such as <b>sandstones,</b> limestones and shales laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the Transantarctic Mountains. In coastal areas such as Shackleton Range and Victoria Land some faulting has occurred.|$|E
50|$|The term quader <b>sandstone</b> {{mountains}} or square <b>sandstone</b> mountains (Quadersandsteingebirge), {{introduced by}} Hanns Bruno Geinitz in 1849, is an historic, geological term for similar <b>sandstone</b> deposits, {{but was also}} used {{in connection with the}} Elbe <b>Sandstone</b> Mountains.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sandstone</b> false antechinus, Pseudantechinus bilarni, {{also known}} as the <b>sandstone</b> pseudantechinus, the <b>sandstone</b> antechinus, the <b>sandstone</b> dibbler, Harney's antechinus and the Northern dibbler, is a species of small {{carnivorous}} marsupial, which has a patchy distribution in Australia's Northern Territory.|$|R
2500|$|This <b>sandstone</b> {{formation}} {{is very different}} from the rock one typically finds in Sweden (granite and gneiss). It is also very different from the rest of the Scandes, which are part of the Caledonian orogen. This <b>sandstone</b> is called the Dalecarlian <b>sandstone,</b> or the <b>sandstone</b> of Trysil on the Norwegian side. It constitutes the largest <b>sandstone</b> area in Sweden and reaches a thickness of [...] The <b>sandstone</b> is usually reddish, but can also be gray, yellow, or brown.|$|R
5|$|Further east, the {{homogeneous}} Cardiff divides {{into the}} Bridgewater, Solsville, and Pecksport shale members, from base to top. The Bridgewater is a fissile dark silty shale with relatively rare fossils. A thin concretionary zone lies above, then the Solsville grades from a gray calcareous shale, to sandy siltstones and fine <b>sandstones</b> at the top, with the gray shale of the Pecksport shale and siltsone overlying it.|$|E
5|$|Next is the Menefee Formation, {{the middle}} {{formation}} whose content features interbedded carbonaceous shales, siltstones, and <b>sandstones.</b> These were deposited in semi-marine environments of brackish water, such as swamps and lagoons. Due to its depositional {{environment and the}} organic material in its composition, there are thin coal seams running through the Menefee Formation. At the top, this formation is intruded upon by the Cliff House Sandstone.|$|E
5|$|The Nama {{assemblage}} is best {{represented in}} Namibia. Three-dimensional preservation is most common, with organisms preserved in sandy beds containing internal bedding. Dima Grazhdankin believes that these fossils represent burrowing organisms, while Guy Narbonne maintains they were surface dwellers. These beds are sandwiched between units comprising interbedded <b>sandstones,</b> siltstones and shales – with microbial mats, where present, usually containing the fossils. The environment is interpreted as sand bars formed {{at the mouth}} of a delta's distributaries.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sandstone</b> {{exposed in}} canyons nearer to the Colorado River are {{typically}} from the Glen Canyon Group. The dark red cliffs of Coyote Gulch, for example, {{are composed of}} Navajo <b>Sandstone.</b> The lighter <b>sandstone</b> domes of Dance Hall Rock and Sooner Rocks are formed from the higher Entrada <b>sandstone</b> layer. Due to tilting of layers throughout the area, <b>sandstone</b> exposed at higher elevations {{near the town of}} Escalante (e.g. Deer Creek) may actually be from a lower layer, Wingate <b>Sandstone.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Mount Simon <b>Sandstone</b> is the basal <b>sandstone</b> of the Potsdam <b>Sandstone.</b> It was {{deposited}} in a nearshore environment, unconformably overlying Precambrian basement.|$|R

5|$|The Old Red Sandstone Continent {{became a}} part of the supercontinent Pangaea in the Permian (299–252 Ma), during which proto-Britain {{continued}} to drift northwards. Scotland's climate was arid at this time and some fossils of reptiles have been recovered. However, Permian <b>sandstones</b> are found in only a few places - principally in the south west, on the island of Arran, and on the Moray coast. Stone quarried from Hopeman in Moray has been used in the National Museum and Scottish Parliament buildings in Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|The Old Red Sandstone is {{a series}} of red <b>sandstones,</b> marls and conglomerates. It rises as an {{anticline}} in the Mendips and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Portishead. Carboniferous Limestone, of marine origin, covers the sandstone and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Weston-super-Mare where it contains volcanic rocks. There are outlying hills at Worlebury, Middle Hope, the Failand Ridge, Broadfields Down, Portishead Down and Wrington Hill.|$|E
5|$|The early name, Bolton le Moors, {{described}} {{the position of}} the town amid the low hills {{on the edge of the}} West Pennine Moors southeast of Rivington Pike (456 m). Bolton lies on relatively flat land on both sides of the clough or steep-banked valley through which the River Croal flows in a southeasterly direction towards the River Irwell. The geological formation around Bolton consists of <b>sandstones</b> of the Carboniferous series and Coal Measures; in the northern part of Bolton the lower Coal Measures are mixed with underlying Millstone Grit.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the 1900s, Bayfield group <b>sandstone</b> {{was also}} {{variously}} named Lake Superior <b>Sandstone,</b> brownstone, or redstone, and prefixed by the quarry location. The name {{was changed to}} the Bayfield group as its relation to Jacobsville <b>Sandstone</b> (once known as Lake Superior <b>Sandstone)</b> is uncertain.|$|R
50|$|In 1910-12 {{the cement}} {{industry}} killed the <b>sandstone</b> industry, and rock production stopped. The only <b>sandstone</b> construction {{that went on}} during this period was the University of Colorado's new unified campus. The <b>sandstone</b> business was revived in the 1930s when the red <b>sandstone</b> started to be used more as a decorative rock than for commercial purposes. Today it is a booming industry, with <b>sandstone</b> shipped worldwide.|$|R
50|$|Jacobsville <b>Sandstone</b> is {{generally}} red, due to small quantities of iron oxides, mottled with various pinks, whites and browns. The <b>sandstone</b> exhibits many white streaks and spherical spots, caused by leaching and bleaching, which form sharp boundaries with surrounding colors. Its lithology varies from quartz-rich to feldspar-rich <b>sandstone</b> and shale. The formation {{consists of four}} distinct facies: conglomerate, lenticular <b>sandstone,</b> massive <b>sandstone,</b> and red siltstone.|$|R
