40|$|International audienceToday, {{researchers}} {{studying the}} <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> law have two challenges facing them. First, they must study the material <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> law. Indeed, these material <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> law are traditionally left out, {{although they are}} very important {{and more and more}} original works can be carried on them. Second, they must rethink the formal <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> law. As more and more new types of norms and new types <b>of</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> norms born, researchers have to take them seriously. Therefore, this study invites to advance research on the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> law so that it does not become archaic and adapts to changes in the world of law. Research on the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> law, such as research on law in general, must be dynamic and pragmatic...|$|R

5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{power for the}} tram system, the station was a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> electricity for local homes. The building of a power station brought major environmental improvements to what was a highly polluted area, because electricity represented a much cleaner <b>source</b> <b>of</b> household energy than coal, which was used at the time. Local households gradually switched to the new power source. A partner in the enterprise of the Lemington power station was Sir Matthew White Ridley, who had considerable interests in coal and banking.|$|E

At prevailing winds, most of the sediments from the Colorado would have been transported to the Cerro Prieto area and possibly carried by wind to the Gran Desierto de Altar.|$|E

New global forms of worker power are examined, and I conclude by suggesting that the missing dimension in the three <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> power identified – structural, associational and societal – is institutional power. If these new initiatives are to be sustainable they will need to include one <b>of</b> labour’s traditional <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> power, institutional power.
