5|$|On 14 July 1876, Thunderer {{suffered}} a disastrous boiler explosion which killed 45 people. One of her boilers burst as she proceeded from Portsmouth Harbour to Stokes Bay {{to carry out}} a full-power trial. The explosion killed 15 people instantly, including her commanding officer; around 70 others were injured, of whom 30 later died. This was the Royal Navy's most deadly boiler explosion through the whole century. A model representing the failed boiler was made and is now in the Science Museum. The explosion was caused because a pressure gauge was broken and the safety valve had corroded in place. When the steam <b>stop</b> <b>valve</b> to the engines was closed, pressure in the boiler rose and could not be released. The four box boilers were the last in service in the Navy and operated at what would even then would have been considered a relatively low pressure, for more modern boilers, of 30 psi. The boiler was repaired and the ship was completed on 26 May 1877 at a cost of £368,428.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the AGR was such that the final steam {{conditions}} at the boiler <b>stop</b> <b>valve</b> were identical to that of conventional coal-fired power stations, thus the same design of turbo-generator plant could be used. The mean temperature of the hot coolant leaving the reactor core {{was designed to be}} 648°C. In order to obtain these high temperatures, yet ensure useful graphite core life (graphite oxidises readily in CO2 at high temperature) a re-entrant flow of coolant at the lower boiler outlet temperature of 278°C is utilised to cool the graphite, ensuring that the graphite core temperatures do not vary too much from those seen in a Magnox station. The superheater outlet temperature and pressure were designed to be 2,485psi (170 bar) and 543°C.|$|E

The capillary <b>stop</b> <b>valves</b> and micro sample separator were fabricated on polycarbonate (PC) substrates by using hot embossing techniques.

Various density segments of samples required for an analysis can be separated by simply rotating at different speeds. Design parameters of the capillary valves used in micro sample separator have been analyzed theoretically. It is shown that the pressure barrier of capillary valve design can be better predicted by using current modified 3 -D meniscus model.

All had been proceeding to plan with the tank [...] "fast filled" [...] during tanking, until the first leak indication was revealed. Firstly, a 33,000 ppm leak then reduced to a level below 20,000 ppm was recorded. The Launch Commit Criteria limit was 40–44,000 ppm. The leak was only being observed during the cycling of the vent valve to [...] "open" [...] to release the gaseous hydrogen from the tank to the flare stack.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{introduces}} a condition diagnosis technique for a turbine governor system. The governor system {{is an important}} control system to handle turbine speed in a nuclear power plant. The turbine governor system includes turbine <b>valves</b> and <b>stop</b> <b>valves</b> which have their own functions in the system. Because a turbine governor system is operated by high oil pressure, {{it is very difficult}} to maintain under stable operating conditions. Turbine valves supply oil pressure to the governor system for proper operation. Using the pressure variation of turbine and governor valves, operating conditions of the turbine governor control system are detected and identified. To achieve automatic detection of valve status, time-based and frequency-based analysis is employed. In this study, a new approach, wavelet decomposition, was used to extract specific features from the pressure signals of the governor and <b>stop</b> <b>valves.</b> The extracted features, which represent the operating conditions of the turbine governor system, include important information to control and diagnose the valves. After extracting the specific features, decision rules were used to classify the valve conditions. The rules were generated by a decision tree algorithm (a typical simple method for data-based rule generation). The results given by the wavelet-based analysis were compared to detection results using time- and frequency-based approaches. Compared with the several related studies, the wavelet transform-based analysis, the proposed in this study has the advantage of easier application without auxiliary features...|$|R

40|$|Nuclear reactor plants {{include a}} turbine {{generator}} system (TGS) {{to convert the}} energy in steam from the {{nuclear steam supply system}} into electrical energy. The TGS consists essentially of the turbine unit and the automatic devices, alarms, and trips which control and regulate turbine action, and the generator unit and its Con-trols. The turbine control system and the steam inlet <b>stop</b> and control <b>valves,</b> the low pressure turbine steam intercept and inlet control valves, and the extraction steam control valves control the speed of the turbine under normal and abnormal conditions, and are thus related to the overall safe operation of the plant. The turbine generator system installed in a nuclear plant is typically equipped with redundant overspeed protection instrumentation and controls and the main steam and reheat steam control and <b>stop</b> <b>valving</b> arrangements typically provide redundancy in the valves essential for overspeed protection. The intent of the review under this SRP section is to verify that such redundancy, in conjunction with inservice inspection and testing of the essential valves, makes a turbine overspeed condition above the design overspeed very unlikely and to assure conformance with General Design Criterion 4. Assessment of the risk to essential plant systems and struc-tures from potential turbine missiles is reviewed under SRP Section 3. 5. 1. 3. 1. The PSB reviews the turbine generator system and the components and subsystems normally provided with this equipment with respect to the following considera-tions: a.

40|$|This {{project was}} carried out as a study of flow rate using a single channel {{acoustic}} emission (AE) technique. The objective of this project is to study the effect of ball valve, brass gate <b>valve</b> and brass <b>stop</b> cock <b>valve</b> to flow rate using AE technique. A test rig consists of the circumferential galvanized steel pipe, ball valve, gate <b>valve</b> and <b>stop</b> cock <b>valve</b> to run the experiments.

The source of AE signal was from the valve and it was captured using AE sensor {{with the help of}} Acoustic Emission Detector 2. 1. 3 software. For all valve conditions, the value of hits, count and RMS (average, maximum and minimum) were recorded and analyzed.

The result showed that there was no AE activity on the pipe without valve, the AE activities are greater for high pressure or full close valve.

5000|$|In Russian trains {{there is}} usually an {{emergency}} brake known as a [...] "stop valve" [...] (стоп-кран). In elektrichkas and other trains it is usually located near the doors, and sometimes {{in the middle of}} the car as well. A <b>stop</b> <b>valve</b> usually has a distinctive red handle. Turning the handle down (counter-clockwise) by about 90 degrees causes pneumatic brakes to engage, due to pressure loss in the standard air-braking system. While primitive and not allowing any override such a system is effective, resembling usual train brake activation; it does not fail in emergency conditions. More complicated systems may not provide quick braking when needed, or during a communications failure. Emergency braking is somewhat risky; it is hard on passengers, and there is a risk of passenger injury if braking occurs at high speed. As a result, use of a <b>stop</b> <b>valve</b> without good reason is prohibited and may lead to fines.

50|$|Because of {{the high}} {{pressures}} used in the steam circuits and the materials used, steam turbines and their casings have high thermal inertia. When warming up a steam turbine for use, the main steam <b>stop</b> <b>valves</b> (after the boiler) have a bypass line to allow superheated steam to slowly bypass the valve and proceed to heat up the lines in the system along with the steam turbine. Also, a turning gear is engaged {{when there is no}} steam to slowly rotate the turbine to ensure even heating to prevent uneven expansion. After first rotating the turbine by the turning gear, allowing time for the rotor to assume a straight plane (no bowing), then the turning gear is disengaged and steam is admitted to the turbine, first to the astern blades then to the ahead blades slowly rotating the turbine at 10-15 RPM (0.17-0.25 Hz) to slowly warm the turbine. The warm-up procedure for large steam turbines may exceed ten hours.|$|R

50|$|In subways, {{derailment}} {{is usually}} less dangerous (speeds are lower, trains cannot jackknife in tunnels and so on). It {{is dangerous to}} stop in a tunnel if a fire develops; an emergency exit could lead to electrocution by the third rail (typically energized with 825 volts DC). Instead drivers try to reach the next station, even in an emergency. As a result, there are no emergency brakes directly visible to passengers. However, there are hidden <b>stop</b> <b>valves</b> and simplified train controls, allowing each car to act on its own in need. In an emergency, there are door-control handles (visible to passengers) which are intended to make the pneumatic train doors able to be opened by removing air pressure.
