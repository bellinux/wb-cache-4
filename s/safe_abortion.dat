While abortion rates have fallen in developed countries, but not in developing countries. Between 2010–2014 there were 35 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44, a total of 56 million abortions per year.

25|$|For many people, {{abortion}} {{is essentially a}} moral issue, concerning the commencement of human personhood, {{the rights of the}} fetus, and a woman's rights over her own body. The debate has become a political and legal issue in some countries with anti-abortion campaigners seeking to enact, maintain and expand anti-abortion laws, while abortion rights campaigners seeking the repeal or easing of such laws while expanding access to abortion. Abortion laws vary considerably between jurisdictions, ranging from outright prohibition of the procedure to public funding of abortion. Availability of <b>safe</b> <b>abortion</b> also varies across the world.|$|E

Reproductive rights may also be understood to include education about contraception and sexually transmitted infections.

[...] He also offered a number of recipes for herbal bathes, rubs, and pessaries.

2500|$|In 1985, the {{abortion}} law passed in Ghana allowed for legal and <b>safe</b> <b>abortion</b> by a qualified medical practitioner for pregnancies {{that resulted from}} rape or incest, if the pregnancy threatens {{the life of the}} woman or her physical or mental health, or if there is substantial risk that the fetus would suffer from a serious physical anomaly or devastating disease. Many women in Ghana are not aware that abortion is legal in their country and tend to seek unsafe abortion providers and receive unsafe care afterwards. As a result, more than 11% of maternal deaths are due to unsafe abortions, making it the second most common death in women in Ghana. According to the 2007 Ghana Maternal Health Survey (GMHS), 7% of all pregnancies end in abortion. The incidences of abortion are higher in women who are 20–24 years old, educated and wealthy women, and women who live in urban areas.

2500|$|According to Human Rights Watch, [...] "Abortion is {{a highly}} {{emotional}} subject and one that excites deeply held opinions. However, equitable access to <b>safe</b> <b>abortion</b> services {{is first and foremost}} a human right. Where abortion is safe and legal, no one is forced to have one. Where abortion is illegal and unsafe, women are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term or suffer serious health consequences and even death. Approximately 13% of maternal deaths worldwide are attributable to unsafe abortion—between 68,000 and 78,000 deaths annually." [...] According to Human Rights Watch, [...] "the denial of a pregnant woman's right to make an independent decision regarding abortion violates or poses a threat {{to a wide range of}} human rights." [...] One can argue that even though women die from unsafe abortion, the legalization of abortion is considered a human right violation since it supports a cause that deprives the unborn of their humanity, which must be respected, and therefore another solution is needed in order to avoid maternal deaths (e.g., psychological and physiological support during and after pregnancy) whilst also avoiding abortion. According to World Health Organization, 56 million abortions on average occurred worldwide each year in 2010-2014.|$|E
