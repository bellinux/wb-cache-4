5|$|In mid-2000 the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) {{invited a}} team from King's College London to conduct a study of East Timor's {{security}} force options. The team's report identified three options for an East Timorese military. Option1 was based on FALINTIL's preference for a relatively large and heavily armed military of 3,000–5,000 personnel, option2 was a force of 1,500 regulars and 1,500 conscripts and option3 was for a force of 1,500 regulars and 1,500 volunteer reservists. The study team recommended option3 as being best suited to East Timor's <b>security</b> <b>needs</b> and economic situation. This recommendation was accepted by UNTAET in September 2000 and {{formed the basis of}} East Timor's defence planning. The plan was also accepted by all the countries that had contributed peacekeeping forces to East Timor. The King's College report has been criticised {{on the grounds that it}} led East Timor to establish a large police force and a large Army when its <b>security</b> <b>needs</b> may have been better met by a single smaller paramilitary force.|$|E
5|$|The Murrah Federal Building {{had been}} {{considered}} so safe that it only employed one security guard. In June 1995, the DOJ issued Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities, also known as The Marshals Report, the findings of {{which resulted in a}} thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and a system for classifying risks at over 1,300federal facilities owned or leased by the federal government. Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1 (minimum <b>security</b> <b>needs)</b> to Level 5 (maximum). The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building. Among the 52security improvements were physical barriers, closed-circuit television monitoring, site planning and access, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities, and structural engineering design to prevent progressive collapse.|$|E

25|$|While {{national}} service {{was introduced in}} 1967 in Singapore, it was solely geared towards the building up of the Singapore Armed Forces. There was little urgency in the police force to increase its manpower strength until the Laju incident in 1974 demonstrated {{the need for additional}} trained reserve officers who can be called up at short notice {{in the event of an}} emergency. National service was thus extended to the Singapore Police Force in 1975, with the primary aim of guarding key installations and to act as a reserve unit. Subsequent expansion of the scheme, changing <b>security</b> <b>needs,</b> and the trend in outsourcing installation protection (such as to the Auxiliary Police Forces) has expanded their role to more functions, which may range from administration, investigation to front-line policing alongside their regular counterparts.|$|E
