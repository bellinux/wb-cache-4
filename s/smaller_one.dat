5|$|On April 9, 2007, {{the show}} debuted a new set. The {{projection}} screens were revamped (with one large screen behind Stewart, while the <b>smaller</b> <b>one</b> behind the interview subject remained the same), a large, global map directly behind Stewart, {{a more open}} studio floor, and a J-shaped desk supported at one end by a globe. The intro was also updated; the graphics, display names, dates, and logos were all changed.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Thistle {{has always been}} prone to {{landslides}}. Pre-historic landslides created the more gentle slopes that made the area usable as a transportation corridor across the Wasatch Mountains. Minor landslides have been frequently observed, and continue to occur. The largest recorded landslides are the 1983 slide which destroyed the town, and a <b>smaller</b> <b>one</b> in 1998.|$|E
5|$|After the {{parachute}} brigade withdrew, the Axis forces {{gathered at the}} bridge. They now comprised the Italian 372nd Coastal Battalion and the Arditi Battalion, with the German 1st Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion and Captain Stangenberg's Battle group. The German High Command {{was aware of the}} importance of holding the bridge, and overnight they dispatched reinforcements who arrived by parachute. These came from the 1st Fallschirmjäger Division, and consisted of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Engineer Battalion, the 1st Battalion, 4th Fallschirmjäger Regiment and a battalion of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Artillery Regiment. The Fallschirmjäger engineers started to form a defensive line to the north of the bridge, and a <b>smaller</b> <b>one</b> on the southern bank.|$|E
5000|$|Auctioneer: He auctions {{horses in}} the market. At first he is angered that the boy brings <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> onto the stage and {{slightly}} embarrasses him. However, when the boy tells him what <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> can do, the man changes his mind and is intrigued, especially when the boy tells him that <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> is [...] "good enough {{to be in a}} King's stable". With that, he decides to have some fun. He mocks and almost injures <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> with his weight. But when <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> sees his best friend pushed aside, he regains his strength and throws the man off of his back. The auctioneer then chases them away.|$|R
50|$|The boy and {{his father}} take the donkeys to work one morning, as they always do. Many times, the boy loads <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> with <b>small</b> sticks, since <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> can't carry heavy loads any more. <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> even has trouble {{carrying}} stacks of small sticks and the boy helps to carry them for him.|$|R
50|$|Boy: He {{is about}} ten years old. Although he takes {{care of all the}} donkeys, <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> is his favorite. When his father tells him to sell <b>Small</b> <b>One,</b> the boy is devastated. Soon he accepts it. Though he loves the donkey, he accepts what his father tells him. He assures <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> will have a gentle and loving master and he does.|$|R
5|$|Below the locks, a five-arched red {{sandstone}} viaduct, {{constructed in}} 1837, crosses the valley. It {{was built by}} Joseph Locke, and carried the Grand Junction Railway. Hunt's locks also consist of a pair, the <b>smaller</b> <b>one</b> from the 1860s and the larger one, with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel semaphore signals control access to the locks, and again {{the movement of the}} gates employs a Pelton turbine. The weir to the east of the locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches, which also support the floodgates. The structure is Baroque in style.|$|E
5|$|Expansion {{sets are}} {{currently}} released in a two-set block, {{starting with a}} large set and ending with a <b>smaller</b> <b>one</b> three months later. Prior to 2016, expansion sets were released in a three-set block (again, beginning with a larger set followed by two smaller sets). These sets consist almost exclusively of newly designed cards. Contrasting with the wide-ranging Core Set, each expansion is focused around a subset of mechanics and ties into a set storyline. Expansions also dedicate several cards {{to a handful of}} particular, often newly introduced, game mechanics.|$|E
5|$|In about 50CE, a Roman vexillatio built a large timber {{fortress}} on {{a hilltop}} (near {{the site of}} the current church) at Letocetum. This housed the Legio XIV Gemina during the campaigns of governor Aulus Didius Gallus against the Brigantes. It was a good defensive position, but the poor farmland surrounding the fortress could not support large numbers of soldiers. During the Neronian period this initial fortress was replaced with a <b>smaller</b> <b>one</b> and Letocetum then developed into a large-scale posting station. Most of the troops moved to the fortress at Viroconium during the early administration of Gaius Suetonius Paulinus in about 58CE.|$|E
50|$|The {{extension}} {{which measures}} 99 meters by 38.7 meters is rectangular in shape with one main dome and four <b>smaller</b> <b>ones,</b> one at each corner. As is seen now, the palace has two main domes and eight <b>smaller</b> <b>ones</b> located at each {{corner of the}} palace.|$|R
50|$|Independent and congregational churches {{exist in}} all larger towns and many <b>smaller</b> <b>ones,</b> but most such churches are <b>small.</b> <b>One</b> {{of these is}} the confessional Lutheran Church called Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Germany.|$|R
50|$|Father: The boy's {{father is}} not seen much at all. He {{is the one who}} sends the boy to sell <b>Small</b> <b>One.</b> He loves his son and deep down, he loves <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> too, but he knows they cannot afford to keep a donkey that cannot carry a large load. He owes money to the Three Merchants, which may impact his {{decision}} to profit from <b>Small</b> <b>One's</b> gradual enfeeblement.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, {{there was an}} old ferry road near the mouth of Little Wapwallopen Creek. A {{railroad}} bridge also crosses the creek. Historically, a road ran from a small settlement on Big Wapwallopen Creek to an even <b>smaller</b> <b>one</b> on Little Wapwallopen Creek, near where Church Road presently is. The Glen Brook Water Company once had plans to construct a dam on the creek and also on its tributary Pond Creek. The Wilkes-Barre Ice Company and the Hazleton Ice Company also dammed a stream in the creek's watershed in 1912 and 1916 respectively, forming the Ice Ponds.|$|E
5|$|Like the Coronation Necklace, these {{earrings}} {{have been}} worn by queens regnant and consort at every coronation since 1901. Made for Queen Victoria in 1858 using the diamonds {{from an old}} Garter badge, they are of typical design: a large brilliant followed by a <b>smaller</b> <b>one,</b> with a large pear-shaped drop. The drops were originally part of the Koh-i-Noor armlet. After they had been made, Victoria wore the earrings and matching necklace in the painting Queen Victoria by the European court painter, Franz Winterhalter.|$|E
5|$|Around the planisphere {{moves the}} rete, a {{web-like}} metal cutout representing the zodiac, which {{also features a}} Julian calendar dial. Above the rete, a display indicates {{the day of the}} week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the <b>smaller</b> <b>one</b> indicating the date on the retes calendar dial. The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.|$|E
50|$|The next morning, the boy takes <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> to {{the market}} in Nazareth. Unfortunately, nobody wants an old weak donkey but the tanner, and he only wants to kill <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> to make leather out of his hide. After failing to find another buyer, {{the boy and his}} donkey return to the tanner's shop. The boy weeps, and <b>Small</b> <b>One,</b> {{accepting}} his fate under the tanner's knife, tenderly consoles the boy.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> is a 1947 Christmas novelette {{written by}} Charles Tazewell and {{illustrated}} by Franklin Whitman about a young boy who has to sell his donkey named <b>Small</b> <b>One.</b> It was adapted into the Disney featurette in Christmas 1978.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 13.5-14.5 mm. The forewings are brownish grey {{with a dark}} fuscous scale tuft at one-third {{below the}} cell. There is also a large costal patch near the middle, a <b>small</b> <b>one</b> before the middle, {{as well as two}} to three <b>small</b> <b>ones</b> beyond it.|$|R
5|$|In Akagi predecessor, Hōshō, the hot {{exhaust gases}} vented by {{swivelling}} funnels posed {{a danger to}} the ship, and wind-tunnel testing had not suggested any solutions. Akagi and Kaga were given different solutions to evaluate in real-world conditions. Akagi was given two funnels on the starboard side. The larger, forward funnel was angled 30° below horizontal with its mouth facing the sea, and the <b>smaller</b> <b>one</b> exhausted vertically a little past the edge of the flight deck. The forward funnel was fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot exhaust gases and a cover that could be raised to allow the exhaust gases to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. Kaga adopted a version of this configuration when she was modernized during the mid-1930s.|$|E
5|$|The first lower molar (m1) bears {{four main}} crests and a <b>smaller</b> <b>one</b> {{between the two}} crests at the back. An {{additional}} crest (the anterotropid) is present between the two front crests, the anterolophid and the metalophid, in S.alpinus, but not in S.bolligeri. The occlusal pattern of m2 resembles that of m1. S.bolligeri also lacks an anterotropid on m2, but the tooth is not known from Oberdorf. In a worn m2 from Tägernaustrasse, there is a thickened portion in the labial part of the anterolophid, which Prieto interpreted as a remnant of the anterotropid; this led him to identify the Tägernaustrasse population as S. cf. alpinus. Only Oberdorf has yielded the m3 of Seorsumuscardinus. It resembles the m1 and has a short anterotropid, but has more oblique crests. In S.alpinus, the lower molars have two and occasionally three roots. The roots of the m1 of S.bolligeri are not preserved and the m2 has two roots.|$|E
5|$|The m1 is unknown. In m2, {{there are}} two {{well-developed}} transverse crests and one <b>smaller</b> <b>one</b> behind them. The first one consists of two cusps, the anteroconid (labial) and the metaconid (lingual) and the second one joins the protoconid at the labial side with the entoconid at the lingual side. The second crest is weakly joined to the third one, which joins the hypoconid at the labial side to the posteroconid at the back. In one specimen, a cingulum (ridge) is present {{at the back of}} the tooth and a small cusp, the ectostylid, is also present. The m3 becomes narrower towards the back, rendering its form triangular, and contains three crests. The first one again consists of the anteroconid and the metaconid and the second of the protoconid and the entoconid. The third is smaller and consists of the hypoconid with the posteroconid in one specimen, but in the other the posteroconid is reduced to a narrow crest, the posterolophid. Unlike in B.albicauda, the hypoconid remains separate from the posterolophid and is not fused to it. Both m2 and m3 have two roots.|$|E

50|$|The three donkeys: <b>Small</b> <b>One's</b> barn mates. They seem jealous {{that the}} boy spends more time with <b>Small</b> <b>One</b> than them, but they {{understand}} {{that the boy}} represents a forerunner of the Christ {{in the tradition of}} John the Baptist, and they forgive the boy for his favoritism.|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} the growth of {{vegetative}} stadium of Amorphophallus titanum (Becc.) Becc. {{has been carried out}} in Cibodas Botanic Garden. Two bulbs are planted as collection plants since June second 2000. The big one, before dormant was in generative stadium and the other bulb is <b>small</b> <b>one,</b> before dormant was in vegetative stadium. The result {{of this study indicate that}} the growth of the big bulb longer than <b>small</b> <b>one.</b> The effect of different stadium before dormant cause the early growth of big bulb is longer than the <b>small</b> <b>one...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{skull of}} Knoetschesuchus is {{relatively}} short, with the snout taking up 47% of skull length in K. langenbergensis and 42% in K. guimarotae, which {{allows them to}} be classified as brevirostrine crocodilians. Along {{the side of the}} snout are two undulations, a <b>smaller</b> <b>one</b> on the premaxilla and a larger and broader one on the maxilla. The jagged suture between the premaxilla and maxilla is angled towards the front of the skull in K. langenbergensis and towards the back in K. guimarotae. Along the midline of the snout are the thin and wedge-like nasals; the nostrils, which face upwards, are clearly separated by the nasals in K. guimarotae, {{but it is not clear}} that this is the case in K. langenbergensis.|$|E
5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a <b>smaller</b> <b>one.</b> What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain. This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.|$|E
