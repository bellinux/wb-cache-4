40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of how trust regulates {{relationship}} promotion is proposed. The model assumes that trust has both impulsive (i. e., automatic {{attitude toward the}} partner) and reflective (i. e., beliefs about the partner's caring) forms. Because overriding evaluative impulses requires self-regulatory resources, the model further posits that <b>self-regulatory</b> capacity <b>controls</b> whether people strengthen relationship connections {{in the face of}} threats to reflective trust. Two experiments and 1 longitudinal daily diary study utilizing convergent manipulations and measures of self-regulatory capacity supported the model. Results revealed that acute uncertainty about a partner's caring increased relationship-promotive sentiment and behavior when (a) people lacked self-regulatory resources to question impulsively trusting sentiments and (b) when people had self-regulatory resources available to override impulsively distrusting sentiments.

40|$|Abstract: Clinical {{evidence}} suggests that initial attempts to regulate weight gain quickly become habit-like in individuals with eating disorders. These behaviors are controlled excessively in patients with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and are controlled more intermittently, with periods of lost control, in patients with Bulimia Nervosa (BN). We suspect that abnormalities in frontostriatal systems that subserve <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>control</b> and habit learning {{may contribute to the}} development and perpetuation of AN and BN. We summarize previous findings and present a pathophysiological model that provides a framework for understanding the shared and non-shared clinical phenotypes of AN and BN. Whereas dysregulated control systems produce heightened <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>control,</b> permitting individuals with AN to sustain excessive dietary restriction, dysregulated control systems likely result in impaired <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>control</b> in patients with BN, releasing feelings of hunger and urges to binge, thereby resulting in overeating. Interactions with cultural ideals of thinness and impaired habit learning systems may then allow the dieting behaviors of individuals with restricting-type AN to spiral into the habitual and restrictive eating behaviors that typify the disorder. Although these cultural factors likely contribute to the compensatory purging behaviors in BN, interactions with normal habit learning systems may explain the higher recovery rate of BN relative to AN, in which habit learning may be impaired. We describe neuroimaging methods that we are using to test these hypotheses and emphasize the potential utility of studying AN and BN early in the course of illness, to disentangle their causes from epiphenomena or compensatory responses. We believe that this innovative approach to studying eatin...|$|E

Thus, the aim of the current study was to explore the roles of action control and action planning as mediators between intentions and dietary behavior. A longitudinal study with three points in time was conducted. Participants (N[*]=[*] 286) were undergraduate students and invited to participate in a health behavior survey. At baseline (Time 1), measures of intention and fruit and vegetable intake were assessed. Two weeks later (Time 2), action control and action planning were assessed as putative sequential mediators.

The results revealed action control and action planning to sequentially mediate between intention and subsequent fruit and vegetable intake, controlling for baseline behavior. Both <b>self-regulatory</b> constructs, action <b>control</b> and action planning, make a difference when moving from motivation to action. Our preliminary evidence, therefore, suggests that planning may be more proximal to fruit and vegetable intake than action control.

40|$|Abstract. Understanding the <b>self-regulatory</b> {{mechanisms}} <b>controlling</b> {{the spatial}} and temporal structure of multicellular organisms {{represents one of the}} major challenges in molecular biology. In the context of plants, shoot apical meristems (SAMs), which are populations of dividing, undif-ferentiated cells that generate organs at the tips of stems and branches throughout the life of a plant, are of particular interest and currently studied intensively. Here, one key goal is to identify the genetic regu-latory network organizing the structure of a SAM and generating the corresponding spatial gene expression patterns. This paper addresses one step in the design of SAM models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) : parameter estimation for spatial pattern formation. We assume that the topology of the genetic regula-tory network is given, while the parameters of an ODE system need to be determined such that a particular stable pattern over the SAM cell population emerges. To this end, we propose an evolutionary algorithm-based approach and investigate different ways to improve the efficiency of the search process. Preliminary results are presented for the Brusselator, a well-known reaction-diffusion system. ...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, it was {{believed}} that only cells modified in their surface structure would stimulate autologous cells. Recent findings that human autoreactive T cells with exquisite specificity for unmodified non-T cells (NT cells) are readily demonstrable after changing the relative proportions between T and NT cells (1, 2) have therefore attracted much attention. These authors have shown that T cells positively enriched by their capacity to form rosettes with sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) will be induced to proliferate when cultivated with autologous NT cells. Subsequent studies (3 - 6) revealed specificity for self, the build-up of an immunological memory, and the generation of suppressor and killer cells in these autologous mixed lymphocyte reactions (AMLR). These observations led to the view that autoreactive T cells proliferating in AMLR represent members of a <b>self-regulatory</b> immune <b>control</b> system. Our search to define AMLR-inducing autoantigens led to quite contrary results: we present evidence that the majority of T ceils proliferating in AMLR are not specific for autoantigens but are specific for xenoantigens that are derived from SRBC during the rosetting procedure...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that pathological eating behaviours in bulimia nervosa (BN) are underpinned by alterations in reward processing and <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>control,</b> and by functional changes in neurocircuitry encompassing the {{dorsolateral prefrontal cortex}} (DLPFC). Manipulation of this region with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may therefore alleviate symptoms of the disorder. This double-blind sham-controlled proof-of-principle trial investigated the effects of bilateral tDCS over the DLPFC in adults with BN. Thirty-nine participants (two males) received three sessions of tDCS in a randomised and counterbalanced order: anode right/cathode left (AR/CL), anode left/cathode right (AL/CR), and sham. A battery of psychological/neurocognitive measures was completed before and after each session {{and the frequency of}} bulimic behaviours during the following 24 -hours was recorded. AR/CL tDCS reduced eating disorder cognitions (indexed by the Mizes Eating Disorder Cognitions Questionnaire-Revised) when compared to AL/CR and sham tDCS. Both active conditions suppressed the self-reported urge to binge-eat and increased <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>control</b> during a temporal discounting task. Compared to sham stimulation, mood (assessed with the Profile of Mood States) improved after AR/CL but not AL/CR tDCS. Lastly, the three tDCS sessions had comparable effects on the wanting/liking of food and on bulimic behaviours during the 24 hours post-stimulation. These data suggest that single-session tDCS transiently improves symptoms of BN. They also help to elucidate possible mechanisms of action and highlight the importance of selecting the optimal electrode montage. Multi-session trials are needed to determine whether tDCS has potential for development as a treatment for adult BN...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Bulimia nervosa (BN) is {{associated}} with a deficit of <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>control</b> and impulsivity. The present study aimed to clarify whether an impaired inhibitory control due to hyperarousal underlies impulsivity in BN subjects. Methods: Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in 17 female patients with BN and 17 healthy controls during a three-tone oddball task. ERP components related to inhibition of irrelevant distractor stimuli, as well as effortful processing, were analyzed. Standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) was used to assess ERP source activity. Results: Compared to healthy controls, BN patients showed reduced amplitude and shorter latency of the N 200 (N 2), increased amplitude and shorter latency of the target slow wave (SW), and higher amplitude of the P 300 for distractor stimuli (P 3 a) and for targets (P 3 b). sLORETA showed the following: (1) higher activity of the P 3 a generators in the left parietal cortex, bilateral precuneus and right frontal and anterior cingulate for distractor stimuli and (2) lower activity of the SW generators in the left medial frontal gyrus, bilateral superior frontal, anterior cingulate and cuneus for target stimuli. The reduction of the N 2 latency was associated with the Barratt scores for impulsiveness. Conclusions: The observed electrophysiological abnormalities suggest a condition of hyperarousal, with impaired suppression of irrelevant stimuli due to abnormal cortical activation and reduced signal-to-noise ratio. Our findings point to functional abnormalities within a neural system that subserves attention and <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>control,</b> which may contribute to impulsive behaviors in BN...|$|E

30|$|In the {{academic}} domain, using cross-lagged panel path analysis, Brandstätter and colleagues [16, 41] provided {{convincing evidence that}} an action crisis temporally antecedes devaluation of goal-desirability and deterioration in perceived goal-attainability. Similarly, recent neuroeconomic research found that in a fatigued state, and moderated by endurance capacity, anticipated costs of future efforts are escalated, while the attractiveness of anticipated rewards are discounted [42]. During psychophysiological crises, stimulus-driven reactive control therefore seems to undermine goal-driven proactive control and negatively impact on thinking-action coupling in the <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>control</b> of goal-striving [43]. However, according to Brick et al.

40|$|Summary-The {{personality}} {{dimension of}} neuroticism (N) {{is of particular}} interest because high N (neurotic) individuals are predisposed to experience negative affect and psychopathology. This study provides a test of the hypothesis that N is associated with individual differences in attentional processes, and, more specifically, that the automatic orienting of attention occurs more readily in neurotic individuals. Subjects performed a visual search task, during which a distractor stimulus on occasion appeared in the stimulus display. Female neurotic subjects were significantly more impaired than were stable subjects in their visual search task performance by the presence of a distractor, indicating that their attention was more strongly attracted by the distracters.

40|$|Obesity-related behaviors, such as {{intake of}} snacks and {{sweetened}} beverages (SSB), {{are assumed to}} result from the interplay between environmental factors and adolescents' ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. The empirical evidence supporting this assumption is missing. This study investigated the relationships between perceptions of at-home and out-of-home food environment (including SSB accessibility, parental, and peers' social pressure to reduce intake of SSB), nutrition <b>self-regulatory</b> strategies (<b>controlling</b> temptations and suppression), and SSB intake. In particular, we hypothesized that these associations would differ across the stages of preadolescence, early and mid-adolescence. Self-reported {{data were collected from}} 2, 764 adolescents (10 - 17 years old; 49 % girls) from 24 schools in the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. Path analysis indicated that direct associations between peers' social influence and SSB intake increased with age. Direct negative associations between at-home and out-of-home accessibility and SSB intake as well as direct positive associations between parental pressure and intake become significantly weaker with age. Accessibility was related negatively to self-regulation, whereas higher social pressure was associated with higher self-regulation. The effects of the environmental factors were mediated by self-regulation. Quantitative and qualitative differences in self-regulation were observed across the stages of adolescence. The associations between the use of self-regulatory strategies and lower SSB intake become significantly stronger with age. In preadolescence, SSB intake was regulated by means of strategies that aimed at direct actions toward tempting food.

In this report, nuclear magnetic resonance and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy are used to demonstrate that the AB subregion of FGFR electrostatically engages the heparan sulfate (HS) -binding site on the D 2 domain in cis to directly suppress HS-binding affinity of FGFR. Furthermore, the cis electrostatic interaction sterically autoinhibits ligand-binding affinity of FGFR because of the close proximity of HS-binding and primary ligand-binding sites on the D 2 domain.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} issue in bioscience {{is to understand}} the mechanism that underlies the dynamic control of genome-wide expression through the complex temporal-spatial self-organization of the genome to regulate the change in cell fate. We address this issue by elucidating a physically motivated mechanism of self-organization. Building upon transcriptome experimental data for seven distinct cell fates, including early embryonic development, we demonstrate that self-organized criticality (SOC) plays {{an essential role in}} the dynamic control of global gene expression regulation at both the population and single-cell levels. The novel findings are as follows: i) Mechanism of cell-fate changes: A sandpile-type critical transition self-organizes overall expression into a few transcription response domains (critical states). A cell-fate change occurs by means of a dissipative pulse-like global perturbation in self-organization through the erasure of initial-state critical behaviors (criticality). Most notably, the reprogramming of early embryo cells destroys the zygote SOC control to initiate self-organization in the new embryonal genome, which passes through a stochastic overall expression pattern. ii) Mechanism of perturbation of SOC controls: Global perturbations in self-organization involve the temporal regulation of critical states. Quantitative evaluation of this perturbation in terminal cell fates reveals that dynamic interactions between critical states determine the critical-state coherent regulation. The occurrence of a temporal change in criticality perturbs this between-states interaction, which directly affects the entire genomic system. Surprisingly, a sub-critical state, corresponding to an ensemble of genes that shows only marginal changes in expression and consequently are considered to be devoid of any interest, plays an essential role in generating a global perturbation in self-organization directed toward the cell-fate change. 'Whole-genome' regulation of gene expression through <b>self-regulatory</b> SOC <b>control</b> complements gene-by-gene fine tuning and represents a still largely unexplored non-equilibrium statistical mechanism that is responsible for the massive reprogramming of genome expression...|$|R
40|$|Background: Tourette {{syndrome}} (TS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder with childhood onset {{characterized by}} chronic motor and vocal tics. The typical clinical {{course of an}} attenuation of symptoms during adolescence in parallel with the emerging <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>control</b> during development suggests that plastic processes may {{play an important role}} in the development of tic symptoms. Methods: We conducted a systematic search to identify existing imaging studies (both anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) in young persons under the age of 19 years with TS. Results: The final search resulted in 13 original studies, which were reviewed with a focus on findings suggesting adaptive processes (using fMRI) and plasticity (using anatomical MRI). Differences in brain activation compared to healthy controls during tasks that require overriding of prepotent responses help to understand compensatory pathways in children with TS. Along with alterations in regions putatively representing the origin of tics, deviations in several other regions most likely represent an activity-dependent neural plasticity that help to modulate tic severity, such as the prefrontal cortex, but also in the corpus callosum and the limbic system. Discussion: Factors that potentially influence the development of adaptive changes in the brain of children with TS are age, comorbidity with other developmental disorders, medication use, IQ along with study-design or MRI techniques for acquisition, and analysis of data. The most prominent limitation of all studies is their cross-sectional design. Longitudinal studies extending to younger age groups and to children at risk for developing TS hopefully will confirm findings of neural plasticity in future investigations. </p...|$|E

The study sample consisted of 29 boys and 33 girls in Australia between 17 and 48 mcnths old. Measures included: (1) a videotaped toy play session in which children were left alone with five boys ' and five girls ' toys; (2) Leinbach and Fagot's gender labeling point test, extended with a self-pointing task; (3) a gender-labeling test of photographs 1. -,f inanimate objects framed in terms of which object a boy or girl would play with; (4) a test requiring children to produce a gender label for photographs; and (5) children's evaluation of a videotape sequences of other-gender-linked conduct. Children's knowledge of gender labels associated with toys was quite poor; however, regardless of age, during the toy play session, all children engaged in more same-sex than other-sex conduct. Younger children demonstrated little negative appraisal of other-sex conduct on the videotape, while the twoolder age groups were more likely to indicate that an other-sex toy was a "bad " toy for the child actor to play with. Children who could point to a boy or girl when their own photograph was one of the two photographs presented engaged in more same-sex activities than children who failed this task.

40|$|An {{emphasis}} on increasing self-regulation is an alternate to nutrition education, {{which has had}} poor results in the behavioral treatment of obesity. Although appropriately designed weight-loss treatments may enhance one's <b>self-regulatory</b> ability to <b>control</b> eating, whether improvements are moderated by psychosocial factors such as initial self-regulatory skills use, self-efficacy to control eating, and mood is unknown. Severely obese women (BMI 35 - 50 kg·m- 2) were randomized into 26 -week treatments of exercise supported by cognitive-behavioral methods paired with either nutrition education (n = 114) or cognitive-behavioral methods applied to controlled eating (n = 121). Improvement in self-regulation for controlled eating was 36. 9 % greater (p < 0. 01) for the group incorporating cognitive-behavioral methods for controlled eating. Change in self-regulation {{was significantly associated with}} self-regulation at baseline (β = - 0. 33). Both mood and self-efficacy for controlled eating significantly moderated this relationship. Increased self-regulation was associated with both increases in fruit and vegetable consumption and fruit and vegetable intake at treatment end. The present findings increase our understanding of psychosocial variables associated with increased self-regulatory skills usage and improvements in eating that, after replication, may be used to improve the effects of behavioral weight-loss treatment...|$|R
40|$|Background: Access to temptation {{is blamed}} for the rising {{prevalence}} of obesity in children. A popular way to counter this is to restrict physical access to temptation. As restrictions cannot be widely applied and may have adverse long-term effects, we examine whether accessible temptations in situations that endorse self-regulation train self-regulation. Specifically, we design a method that enhances children's self-regulatory skills in the long term. Method: In two studies, participants were exposed to temptation in phase one and their self-regulatory skills were measured in phase two. In Study 1, we endorsed self-regulation {{in the presence of}} accessible temptation for four consecutive days and measured consumption on the fifth day. In Study 2, we exposed children to temptation similarly and, in addition, manipulated temptation strength to show that being tempted is crucial for the skill to develop. Next, we measured saliva and preferences. Results: The findings suggest that exposure to temptation in a situation that supports self-regulation leads to better resistance to temptations in later contexts of accessible temptation in girls, but not boys. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that interventions aiming at strengthening children's <b>self-regulatory</b> skills through <b>controlled</b> exposure to temptation might be a productive long-term strategy to reduce consumption of unhealthy food...|$|R
