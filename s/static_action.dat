40|$|Since the {{pioneering}} studies developed by Alan G. Davenport, the equivalent <b>static</b> <b>actions</b> on structures {{are a key}} topic of the wind engineering research. Two main methods have been proposed. The former, {{referred to as the}} gust factor (GF) technique, defines wind actions through a unique load distribution scaled by a non-dimensional coefficient eventually depending on the effect considered. The latter, referred to as the load combination (LC) technique, defines wind actions, till now in the alongwind direction, as a combination of three distinct load distributions associated with the static, quasi-static and resonant parts of the response. This paper provides a rational scheme and a generalisation of these procedures with reference to cantilever vertical structures. As for the GF technique, also the LC technique is initially extended to the 3 -D response, discussing critically a set of alternative models for the quasi-static part of the loading. A new method is also proposed, referred to as the global loading technique, where equivalent <b>static</b> wind <b>actions</b> are assigned as a unique load distribution independent of the load effect considered.

Integrating by parts the global balance condition obtained by the virtual work principle, three linear integral differential equations (expressing local equilibrium) with the relevant boundary conditions are obtained.

40|$|Processing {{of action}} words {{has been shown}} to {{influence}} the perception of the actions the words refer to. Specifically, the accuracy with which people predict the future course of actions observed in another individual seems to be affected by verbal primes. Two processes may be involved in action prediction; dynamic simulation (updating) and static matching. The present study examined this issue by testing the impact of action verb processing on action prediction performance using a masked priming paradigm. Evidence of dynamic updating was revealed after prime verbs expressing dynamic actions (e. g., ‘to catch’) but not those expressing <b>static</b> <b>actions</b> (e. g., ‘to lean’). In contrast to previous work, the primes were masked and did not require any response at all. Hence, our results indicate that implicit action-related linguistic processing may trigger action simulation that in turn might affect action prediction (see also Liepelt, Dolk, & Prinz, Psychological Research, 2012, in this issue) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{simplified}} time-dependent analysis for continuous steel-concrete composite beams with flexible shear connection, subjected to <b>static</b> <b>actions,</b> settlements of the supports, shrinkage, and prestressing {{of the concrete}} slab. By approximating the integral terms with particular quadrature rules (algebraic methods), the integral-differential system, which governs the problem, reduces to a differential system. This provides approximate solutions of the viscoelastic problem directly at the final time, without having to consider the real stress history. Some of the algebraic methods known in the literature (e. g., effective modulus, mean stress, and age adjusted effective modulus methods) are applied to continuous composite beams subjected to the four different actions examined separately. Subsequently, the numerical results obtained are compared {{with the results of}} the accurate numerical analysis (general method), and the validity of each simplified method is discussed.

For this purpose, we decompose video into region classes and augment local features with corresponding region-class labels. In particular, we investigate unsupervised and supervised video segmentation using (i) motion-based foreground segmentation, (ii) person detection, (iii) <b>static</b> <b>action</b> detection and (iv) object detection.

The paper deals with the sample design of a transportation intermodal building capable to distinguish itself from the current anonymous industrial buildings. The design principle consists of creating an internal flexible space with an exterior in-view structure contradicting the traditional idea of structural frame. It starts on with a research of architectures in nature: the external structural skeleton is conceived from textures derived from images of trees. The design of the building accounts for up-to-date construction technologies. Precast prestressed long-span thin slabs are provided. The full seismic protection is achieved by means of a base isolation system, taking advantage of having all the vertical loads carrying structures along the perimeter.

40|$|The {{effect on}} the fusimotor system of {{electrical}} stimulation of the reticular part of the substantia nigra or of the injection of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -antagonist picrotoxin into this structure was studied in spindle receptors of pretibial flexors in cats anaesthetized with ketamine. Afferent activity of muscle spindle primary endings was recorded before and during these two forms of intranigral stimulation. Dynamic spindle sensitivity was assessed during both small- (100 microns) and large-amplitude (2 mm) sinusoidal stretching of the receptor-bearing muscles. From changes in spindle sensitivity after nigral electrical stimulation (eleven out of fourteen primary endings) or intranigral injection of picrotoxin (fifty-one out of sixty-seven primary endings) it is deduced that functional activation of neurones of the reticular part of substantia nigra, in this preparation, removed a normally present tonic <b>static</b> fusimotor <b>action</b> from the primary sensory endings of pretibial flexor muscle spindles. This effect, induced by picrotoxin (2 micrograms in 1 microliter), was reversed by a subsequent intranigral injection of the GABA-agonist muscimol (0. 4 microgram in 1 microliters), but remained unchanged after subsequent intracaudate injections of haloperidol (12. 5 micrograms in 5 microliters) or apomorphine (5 micrograms in 5 microliters).
