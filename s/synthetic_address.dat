In this work, {{we present}} an {{integrated}} solution to three classic {{problems in the}} field of performance analysis: memory modeling, <b>synthetic</b> <b>address</b> trace generation, and the creation of synthetic benchmark proxies for applications. First, we describe an intuitive characterization of memory access locality that can accurately predict an application’s hit rates on arbitrary cache configurations, even when block sizes and cache depths change. We then describe the implementation of a memory tracer that can extract this characterization from applications and a software tool that can generate <b>synthetic</b> <b>address</b> traces to match. Lastly, we describe Chameleon, a fully tunable synthetic benchmark whose memory behavior can be dictated by the traces described above. We show that applications and their Chameleon counterparts display highly similar memory behavior as measured by simulated and observed cache hit rates. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>address</b> trace {{generation}} model which combine the accuracy advantage of trace-driven simulation {{and the low}} complexity advantage of discrete event simulation.

It provides an accurate performance assessmentin cache coherency protocols and other system design issues. However, this technique requires a parallel trace for multiprocessor systems which is difficult and expensive to obtain. Although different techniques in gathering program traces and in reducing the complexity of tracedriven simulation have been developed [1, 2, 3, 4], the complexity of this technique increases as the system size increases due to [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A simple, tunable, {{synthetic}} benchmark with {{a performance}} {{directly related to}} applications would be of great benefit to the scientific computing community. In this paper, we present a novel approach to develop such a benchmark. The initial focus of this project is on data access performance of scientific applications. First a hardware independent characterization of code performance in terms of address streams is developed. The parameters chosen to characterize a single address stream are related to regularity, size, spatial, and temporal locality. These parameters are then used to implement a synthetic benchmark program that mimics {{the performance of a}} corresponding code. To test the validity of our approach we performed experiments using five test kernels on six different platforms. The performance of most of our test kernels can be approximated by a single <b>synthetic</b> <b>address</b> stream.

40|$|Inappropriate {{activation}} of complement contributes to pathology in diverse inflammatory diseases. Soluble recombinant {{forms of the}} natural cell membrane regulators of complement are effective in animal models and some human diseases. However, their use is limited for reasons related to cost, short half lives, and propensity to cause unwanted systemic effects. Some of these limitations may be overcome by use of bacterial expression systems, specific targeting moieties, and judicious choice of regulator. Here we describe the application of these strategies to the generation of a membrane-targeted form of CD 59. A recombinant soluble form of rat CD 59, comprising the first 71 residues of the mature protein and missing the membrane-anchoring signal, was expressed in bacteria, purified, and refolded in a fully active form. The protein was coupled through its carboxyl terminus to a short, <b>synthetic</b> <b>address</b> tag that confers membrane binding activity. Attachment of the membrane address tag markedly increased complement-inhibitory activity assessed in vitro in hemolysis assays. Intra-articular administration of the tagged agent markedly suppressed disease in a model of rheumatoid arthritis in Lewis rats.

40|$|Though the {{performance}} of many applications is dominated by memory behavior, our ability to describe, capture, compare, and recreate that behavior is quite limited. This inability underlies much of the complexity {{in the field of}} performance analysis: it is fundamentally difficult to relate benchmarks and applications or use realistic workloads to guide system design and procurement. A concise, observable, and machine-independent characterization of memory behavior is needed. This dissertation presents the Chameleon framework, an integrated solution to three classic problems in the field of memory performance analysis: reference locality modeling, accurate <b>synthetic</b> <b>address</b> trace generation, and the creation of synthetic benchmark proxies for applications. The framework includes software tools to capture a concise, machine-independent memory signature from any application and produce synthetic memory address traces that mimic that signature. It also includes the Chameleon benchmark, a fully tunable synthetic executable whose memory behavior can be dictated by these signatures. By simultaneously modeling both spatial and temporal locality, Chameleon produces uniquely accurate, general- purpose synthetic traces. Results demonstrate that the cache hit rates generated by each synthetic trace are nearly identical to those of the application it targets on dozens of memory hierarchies representing many of today's commercial offerings. This work focuses on the unique challenges of high-performance computing (HPC) where workload selection, benchmarking, system procurement, performance prediction, and application analysis present important challenges. The Chameleon framework can aid in each scenario by providing a concise representation of the memory requirements of full-scale applications that can be tractably captured and accurately mimicke...|$|E
