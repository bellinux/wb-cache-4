40|$|The coffee sector’s active {{engagement}} with sustainability issues {{appears to be}} a relatively new phenomenon. Even newer is the necessity to deal with recycling and waste. Next to the waste produced by the “coffee to go” mobile drinking culture and coffee bars, the popularity of coffee capsules – i. e. <b>single-use</b> <b>containers</b> made of metal or plastics – is creating mountains of waste unknown to the traditional method of brewing coffee. The pioneer in this premium coffee sector has been Nespresso, a subsidiary and brand of the Swiss company Nestlé. Many other companies – from discount retailers to big-brand coffee shop chains like Starbucks – have copied Nespresso’s machine-and-capsule concept, adding to both the popularity and the waste problem. Next to the problem of waste production, coffee companies are addressing the problem of ethical sourcing. A key but {{by no means the only}} element is sourcing via “fair trade” schemes. Assuming that finding answers to these sustainability challenges can have a crucial impact on future sales, this article sets out to explore coffee companies’ sustainability programmes, using the examples of Nespresso and Starbucks. It finds that both firms engage in rather similar activities, but some critical differences can be identified. Both firms have a successful record in ethical sourcing. But neither has yet developed convincing waste solutions. Nespresso’s insistence on using aluminium for its capsules remains a critical issue...|$|R

Other machines we've tested have more flexibility in adjusting brew strength—the Verismo has buttons for coffee, espresso, and latte with no strength variation for any type. And since Starbucks has limited its coffee selection to its own brand, there are only eight varieties so far plus a milk pod for the latte." ...|$|E
50|$|Glass {{containers}} are wholly recyclable and {{the glass}} industries in many countries retain a policy, sometimes required by government regulations, to maintain a high price on cullet to ensure high return rates. Return rates of 95% are not uncommon in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland). Return rates of less than 50% are usual in other countries.Of course glass containers can also be reused, and in developing countries this is common, however {{the environmental impact of}} washing the container as against remelting them is uncertain.

40|$|This Guideline is {{intended}} to reiterate the NIH “best Practices ” used to ensure the sterility {{and the integrity of}} preservative-free pharmaceuticals and parenteral fluids administered to laboratory animals. Consideration of shorter storage times after opening a preservative-free pharmaceutical or parenteral fluid is warranted, because of the variety of conditions under which these products are stored and the potential for use of inappropriate aseptic technique 1. The US Pharmacopeia— National Formulary (USP-NF) states that opened containers of preservative-free saline for injection or IV fluids should be used within six (6) hours in an area with few particulates in the air 2. The “best practices ” listed below have been used at the NIH to safeguard the stability and efficacy of preservative-free products used in laboratory animals. 1. Procurement of smaller volume containers of preservative-free pharmaceuticals or parenteral fluids (e. g., saline, Lactated Ringers Solution, water for injection, etc.), that can be handled as a <b>single-use</b> <b>container</b> or discarded within a 24 -hour period is recommended. 2.

This paper discusses joint activities {{over the past year}} among Norwegian, Russian, and U. S. technical experts on solid radioactive waste storage technologies in the Arctic for the Russian Navy. These are Western as well as Russian developments and will facilitate meeting the Russian Navy’s needs for storing solid radioactive waste from decommissioned nuclear submarines. The first batch of multiple-use steel containers for transportation and storage of solid radioactive waste have been fabricated at a Russian shipyard and work on the second batch is in process. The partners are also working on <b>single-use</b> concrete <b>containers</b> for transportation and long-term storage, lightweight modular storage buildings, and Russian-made radiation monitoring equipment for use in waste storage facilities. All work is directed at applications in northwest Russia where the Russian Navy is decommissioning large numbers of nuclear submarines and accumulating large amounts of solid radioactive waste. The mission of AMEC Project 1. 4 is to improve the Russian Navy’s capabilities in solid radioactive waste storage and thus minimize the spread of radiological contamination. The ultimate goal of this project is a safe, secure...|$|R
40|$|In {{a coordinated}} effort, the Department of Transportation (DOT) and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) {{proposed}} {{the elimination of}} the Specification Packaging from 49 CFR 173. [1] In accordance with the Federal Register, issued on October 1, 2004, new fabrication of Specification Packages would no longer be authorized. In accordance with the NRC final rulemaking published January 26, 2004, Specification Packagings are mandated by law to be removed from service no later than October 1, 2008. This coordinated effort and resulting rulemaking initiated a planned phase out of Specification Type B and Type A fissile (F) material transportation packages within the Department of Energy (DOE) and its subcontractors. One of the Specification Packages affected by this regulatory change is the UN 1 A 2 Specification Package, per DOT 49 CFR 173. 417 (a) (6). To maintain continuing shipments of DOE materials currently transported in UN 1 A 2 Specification Package after the existing authorization expires, a replacement Type A(F) material packaging design is under development by the Savannah River National Laboratory. This paper presents a summary of the prototype design effort and testing of the new Type A(F) Package development for the DOE. This paper discusses the progress made {{in the development of a}} Type A Fissile Packaging to replace the expiring 49 CFR UN 1 A 2 Specification Fissile Package. The Specification Package was mostly a <b>single-use</b> waste disposal <b>container.</b> The design requirements and authorized radioactive material contents of the UN 1 A 2 Specification Package were defined in 49 CFR. A UN 1 A 2 Specification Package was authorized to ship up to 350 grams of U- 235 in any enrichment and in any non-pyrophoric form. The design was specified as a 55 -gallon 1 A 2 drum overpack with a body constructed from 18 gauge steel with a 16 gauge drum lid. Drum closure was specified as a standard 12 -gauge ring closure. The inner product container size was not specified but was listed as any container that met Specification 7 A requirements per 49 CFR 178. 350. Specification 7 A containers were required to withstand Type A packaging tests required by 49 CFR 173. 465 with compliance demonstrated through testing, analysis or similarity to other containers. The maximum weight of the 7 A product container, the radioactive content, and any internal packaging was limited to 200 lbs. The total gross weight for the UN 1 A 2 Specification Package was limited to 350 lbs. No additional restrictions were applied. Authorization for use did not require the UN 1 A 2 Specification Package to be tested to the Normal Conditions of Transport (NCT) and Hypothetical Accident Conditions (HAC) required for performance based, Type A(F) packages certified by the NRC or DOE. The Type A(F) Packaging design discussed in this paper is required to be in compliance with the regulatory safety requirements defined in Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 10 CFR 71. 41 through 71. 47 and 10 CFR 71. 71. Sub-criticality of content must be maintained under the Hypothetical Accident Conditions specified under 10 CFR 71. 73. These federal regulations, and other applicable DOE Orders and Guides, govern design requirements for a Type A(F) package. Type A(F) packages with less than an A 2 quantity of radioactive material are not required to have a leak testable boundary. With this exception a Type A(F) package design is subject to the same test requirements set forth for the design of a performance based Type B packaging...|$|R
