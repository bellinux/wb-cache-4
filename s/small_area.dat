5|$|Since 1887, {{the borough}} has {{included}} the former villages of Southcote and Whitley and small parts of Earley and Tilehurst. By 1911, it also encompassed the Oxfordshire village of Caversham {{and still more}} of Tilehurst. A <b>small</b> <b>area</b> of Mapledurham parish was added in 1977. An attempt {{to take over a}} <b>small</b> <b>area</b> of Eye and Dunsden parish in Oxfordshire was rejected because of strong local opposition in 1997. Today the borough itself is unparished, and the wards used to elect the borough councillors generally ignore the old parish boundaries and use invented ward names.|$|E
5|$|Blue whales most {{commonly}} live {{alone or with}} one other individual. It is not known how long traveling pairs stay together. In locations {{where there is a}} high concentration of food, as many as 50 blue whales have been seen scattered over a <b>small</b> <b>area.</b> They do not form the large, close-knit groups seen in other baleen species.|$|E

Gora (part of the municipality of Dragaš) and Prohor Pčinjski are minor parts in the north of the Macedonia region in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Mars has {{the largest}} dust storms in the Solar System. These can vary from a storm over a <b>small</b> <b>area,</b> to {{gigantic}} storms that cover the entire planet. They tend to occur when Mars is closest to the Sun, and {{have been shown to}} increase the global temperature.|$|E

50|$|Pier 1 was {{designed}} to host functions for large numbers of persons.

50|$|The {{idea of a}} planar or {{flat surface}} for Earth, however, is still {{sufficient}} for surveys of <b>small</b> <b>areas,</b> as the local topography is far more significant than the curvature. Plane-table surveys are made for relatively <b>small</b> <b>areas,</b> and no account is taken of the curvature of the Earth. A survey of a city would likely be computed as though the Earth were a plane surface {{the size of the}} city. For such <b>small</b> <b>areas,</b> exact positions can be determined relative to each other without considering {{the size and shape of}} the entire Earth.|$|R
5|$|Oecomys sydandersoni is an {{arboreal}} {{species of}} rodent in the genus Oecomys. It lives in forest patches in a <b>small</b> <b>area</b> in eastern Bolivia.

40|$|Area based {{measures}} of deprivation {{are used for}} resourceallocation and research. In both these uses there is con-tinuing debate about the likely proportion of deprived {{people who would be}} missed if area based indices were used for interventions or targeting resources. 1 – 4 This report uses the same source deprivation variables at area and individual levels to quantify the degree of deprivation heterogeneity within very <b>small</b> <b>areas</b> using data from the New Zealand 1996 cen-sus. METHODS AND RESULTS Area deprivation is characterised by the NZDep 96 index of deprivation for <b>small</b> <b>areas.</b> The <b>small</b> <b>areas</b> were constructed from one, or several neighbouring, “meshblocks ” and 91. 5 % contained between 100 and 200 people. The <b>small</b> <b>areas</b> were designed to minimise local heterogeneity while yielding a robust measure of deprivation in the neighbourhood. NZDep 96 is derived from age/sex standardised proportion...|$|R
5|$|A band of {{convection}} formed {{northeast of}} Greg early on September7, inducing moderate to strong northeasterly wind shear on the cyclone. Combined with land interaction, the storm weakened to tropical storm intensity by 18:00UTC that day, and Greg made landfall near Cabo San Lucas three hours later, with winds of 60mph (95km/h). After turning west-northwest and then west, the cyclone moved over progressively cooler waters {{and continued to}} lose strength, although a <b>small</b> <b>area</b> of deep convection persisted. Greg weakened to a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on September8 before succumbing to the unfavorable environment and dissipating a day later west of Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|Anchoring near Darwin Bay, Beebe {{made his}} first attempt at {{studying}} sea animals in their native environment by descending into the ocean in a diving helmet. Beebe continued to perform helmet dives throughout his Galápagos expedition, documenting several previously unknown sea animals. In addition to his helmet dives, Beebe applied the same method of research that he had pioneered in the tropics to a <b>small</b> <b>area</b> of ocean, sailing in circles around it for ten days {{with the intention of}} documenting all actions and interactions of marine life within that area. This study yielded a collection of 3,776 fish of 136 species, many of them also new to science.|$|E
5|$|Ba Cụt was {{publicly}} guillotined on 13 July 1956, in Cần Thơ. His {{body was}} later diced into small pieces, {{which were then}} buried separately. Some followers, led by a deputy named Bảy Đớm, retreated to a <b>small</b> <b>area</b> beside the Cambodian border, where they vowed not to rest until Ba Cụt was avenged. Many of his followers later joined the Việt Cộng—the movement that succeeded the Việt Minh their leader had fought—and took up arms against Diệm.|$|E

5|$|CR101's {{southern}} segment {{begins at}} an intersection with Shelter Rock Road (CR8) and Herricks Road near Herricks High School. The route heads eastward as Searingtown Road, passing {{to the south}} of the high school and to the north of a small pond. One block east of Herricks Road, CR101 intersects with Old Searingtown Road, a former alignment of the current CR101 alignment. At this point, the highway curves to the northeast and passes through a <b>small</b> <b>area</b> of trees nestled amongst a large, residential area bordering Williston Park. Old Searingtown Road rejoins CR101 at the northern edge of the forested area.|$|E
5|$|Dnieper delta: This <b>small</b> <b>area</b> of {{distribution}} in southern Ukraine {{was reported in}} 2005. It is now isolated by steppe from the Danube basin, {{but it has been}} suggested that these areas were connected through marshlands during the last glacial maximum, when the level of the Black Sea was around 100 metres lower than today. This range may also extend to the lower basins of the Dniester and Bug rivers.|$|E
