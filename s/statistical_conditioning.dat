In turn, the Rasch model for dichotomous data (Rasch, 1960/1980) is identical to the BTL model after the person parameter of the Rasch model has been eliminated, as is achieved through <b>statistical</b> <b>conditioning</b> during the process of Conditional Maximum Likelihood estimation. With this in mind, the specification of uniform discriminal dispersions is equivalent to the requirement of parallel Item Characteristic Curves (ICCs) in the Rasch model. Accordingly, as shown by Andrich (1978), the Rasch model should, in principle, yield essentially the same results as those obtained from a Thurstone scale. Like the Rasch model, when applied in a given empirical context, Case 5 of the LCJ constitutes a mathematized hypothesis which embodies theoretical criteria for measurement.|$|E

In this work, we present relational blocking as a new operator {{that can be used}} for learning the structure of causal models. We describe how block-ing is enabled by relational data sets, where blocks are determined by the links in the network. By blocking on entities rather than conditioning on variables, rela-tional blocking can account for both measured and un-observed variables. We explain the mechanism of these methods using graphical models and the semantics of d-separation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of relational blocking for use in causal discovery by show-ing how blocking can be used in the causal analysis of two real-world social media systems. ...|$|E

40|$|Condensation, {{recently}} {{introduced in the}} computer vision literature, is a particle filtering algorithm which represents a tracked object 's state using an entire probability distribution. Clutter can cause the distribution to split temporarily into multiple peaks, each representing a different hypothesis about the object configuration.

"Smoothing" {{in this context is}} the <b>statistical</b> technique of <b>conditioning</b> the state distribution on both past and future measurements once tracking is complete.

40|$|A Kalman filter for {{application}} to stationary or non-stationary time series is proposed. A major feature {{is a new}} initialisation method to accommodate non-stationary time series. The filter works on time series with missing values at any point of time including the initialisation phase.

Another feature of the paper is that the Kalman filter is described in terms of the augmented moments of the state vectors, these being an aggregate of means, variances, covariances and other pertinent information. By doing this, the Kalman filter is specified without direct recourse to those relatively complex formulae for calculating associated means and variances found in traditional expositions.

40|$|When {{the goal}} of {{inference}} is estimating causal effects, we usually have to face problems related {{to the fact that}} treatment assignment is not {{under the control of the}} investigator; in addition some studies may be affected by different sorts of post-treatment selection of observations due to, e. g., non response, truncation or censoring “due to death”. All such complications require to somehow control for them, but the use of the standard <b>statistical</b> <b>conditioning</b> may be in general improper (Rubin, 1974; Rosembaum, 1984). In this paper we consider a specific post-treatment complication, namely the problem of nonignorable nonresponse on an outcome variable in observational studies. This is a typical topic usually known in the econometric literature as endogenous selection; here we tackle this problem specifically within a causal inference framework. By exploiting Principal Stratification (Frangakis and Rubin, 2002), we analyze and propose identification strategies in the presence of an instrumental variable for nonresponse. We focus on the different role and meaning of the instrumental variable, also by comparing our framework with a general nonseparable selection model setting. As a motivating example we consider a simplified evaluation study in the field of financial aids to firms, where typically missingness on the outcome variables, such as variables related to firms’performances, can rarely be assumed missing at random...|$|E
40|$|Progression of {{a chronic}} disease {{can lead to}} the {{development}} of secondary illnesses. An example is the development of active tuberculosis (TB) in HIV-infected individuals. HIV disease progression, as indicated by declining CD 4 + T-cell count (CD 4), increases both the risk of TB and the risk of AIDS-related mortality. This means that CD 4 is a time-dependent confounder for the effect of TB on AIDS-related mortality. Part of the effect of TB on AIDS-related mortality may be indirect by causing a drop in CD 4. Estimating the total causal effect of TB on AIDS-related mortality using standard <b>statistical</b> techniques, <b>conditioning</b> on CD 4 to adjust for confounding, then gives an underestimate of the true effect. Marginal structural models (MSMs) can be used to obtain an unbiased estimate. We describe an easily implemented algorithm that uses G-computation to fit an MSM, as an alternative to inverse probability weighting (IPW). Our algorithm is simplified by utilizing individual baseline parameters that describe CD 4 development. Simulation confirms that the algorithm can produce an unbiased estimate of the effect of a secondary illness, when a marker for primary disease progression is both a confounder and intermediary for the effect of the secondary illness. We used the algorithm to estimate the total causal effect of TB on AIDS-related mortality in HIV-infected individuals, and found a hazard ratio of 3. 5 (95 per cent confidence interval 1. 2 - 9. 1).

40|$|We {{present a}} theory of {{classical}} conditioning based on a parallel, rule-based performance system integrated with mechanisms for inductive learning. Inferential heuristics are used to add new rules to the system {{in response to the}} relation between the system's predictions and environmental input. A major heuristic is based on "unusuamess": Novel cues are favored as candidates to predict events that are important or unexpected. Rules have strength values that are revised on the basis of feed-back. The performance system allows rules to operate in parallel, competing to control behavior and obtain reward for successful prediction of important events. Sets of rules can form default hierar-chies: Exception rules censor useful but imperfect default rules, protecting them from loss of strength. The theory is implemented as a computer simulation, which is used to model a broad range of conditioning phenomena, including blocking and overshadowing, the impact of <b>statistical</b> predictability on <b>conditioning,</b> and conditioned inhibition. The theory accounts for a variety of phenomena that previous theories have not dealt with successfully.

40|$|Conditional {{inference}} is {{an intrinsic}} part of statistical theory, though not routinely of <b>statistical</b> practice. <b>Conditioning</b> has two principal objectives; (i) elimination of nuisance parameters, (ii) ensuring relevance of inference to observed sample data, through conditioning on an ancillary statistic, {{when such a}} statistic exists. Apart from formal difficulties with conditional inference, related to such issues as non-uniqueness of ancillary statistics, practical difficulties often arise, as calculating a conditional sampling distribution is typically not easy. Much interest therefore lies in inference procedures which are stable, that is, {{which are based on}} a statistic which has, to some high order in the sample size, the same repeated sampling behaviour unconditionally and conditional on the value of the appropriate conditioning statistic. Accurate approximation to an exact conditional inference can then be achieved by considering the marginal distribution of the stable statistic, ignoring the relevant conditioning. The principal approach to approximation of an intractable exact conditional inference by this route lies in developments in higher-order small-sample likelihood asymptotics. An alternative approach which we consider in this talk uses marginal simulation of the sampling distribution of an appropriately chosen stable statistic to mimic its conditional distribution. We offer theoretical results and empirical guidance to approximate conditioning by the computer-intensive route, for parametric inference on both scalar and vector interest parameters, in the presence of nuisance parameters. A key context where conditioning is used to eliminate nuisance parameters concerns inference in a multi-parameter exponential family setting. Here, computer-intensive methods yield third-order accuracy in approximation of exact conditional inference, under an appropriate handling of the nuisance parameter in the marginal simulation. In the ancillary statistic context, typically only second-order accuracy can be obtained via the marginal distribution of a stable statistic, though in practice excellent approximation is seen in many settings. We aim to provide general recommendations on the effectiveness of marginal simulation approaches to approximation of conditional inference. For one-sided inference on a scalar interest parameter, very effective approximations are obtained by simulating the marginal distribution of the signed root likelihood ratio statistic. With a vector interest parameter, good results are obtained by simulating the marginal expectation of the likelihood ratio statistic and making an empirical Bartlett correction. These approaches extend readily to more complex model settings, such as those involving high-dimensional parameters and where composite likelihood approaches are necessary...|$|R
40|$|An Atmospheric Variability Experiment (AVE) was {{conducted}} over the central U. S. {{in the spring}} of 1982, collecting radiosonde date to verify mesoscale soundings from the VISSR Atmospheric Sounder (VAS) on the GOES satellite. Previously published VAS/AVE comparisons for the 6 March 1982 case found that the satellite retrievals scarcely detected a low level temperature inversion or a mid-tropospheric cold pool over a special mesoscale radiosonde verification network in north central Texas. The previously published regression and physical retrieval algorithms did not fully utilize VAS' sensitivity to important subsynoptic thermal features. Therefore, the 6 March 1982 case was reprocessed adding two enhancements to the VAS regression retrieval algorithm: (1) the regression matrix was determined using AVE profile data obtained in the region at asynoptic times, and (2) more optimistic signal-to-noise <b>statistical</b> <b>conditioning</b> factors were applied to the VAS temperature sounding channels. The new VAS soundings resolve more of the low level temperature inversion and mid-level cold pool. Most of the improvements stems from the utilization of asynoptic radiosonde observations at NWS sites.

40|$|Wildlife {{collision}} {{data are}} ubiquitous, though challenging for making ecological inference due to typically irreducible uncertainty {{relating to the}} sampling process. We illustrate a new approach that is useful for generating inference from predator data arising from wildlife collisions. By simply conditioning on a second prey species sampled via the same collision process, and by using a biologically realistic numerical response functions, we can produce a coherent numerical response relationship between predator and prey. This relationship can then {{be used to make}} inference on the population size of the predator species, including the probability of extinction. The <b>statistical</b> <b>conditioning</b> enables us to account for unmeasured variation in factors influencing the runway strike incidence for individual airports and to enable valid comparisons. A practical application of the approach for testing hypotheses about the distribution and abundance of a predator species is illustrated using the hypothesized red fox incursion into Tasmania, Australia. We estimate that conditional on the numerical response between fox and lagomorph runway strikes on mainland Australia, the predictive probability of observing no runway strikes of foxes in Tasmania after observing 15 lagomorph strikes is 0. 001. We conclude there is enough evidence to safely reject the null hypothesis that there is a widespread red fox population in Tasmania at a population density consistent with prey availability.

40|$|The {{sampling}} {{distributions of}} several statistics that measure {{the association of}} alleles on gametes (linkage disequilibrium) are estimated under a two-locus neutral infinite allele model using an efficient Monte Carlo method. An often used approximation for the mean squared linkage disequilibrium is shown to be inaccurate unless the proper <b>statistical</b> <b>conditioning</b> is used. The joint distribution of linkage disequilibrium and the allele frequencies in the sample is studied. This estimated joint distribution is sufficient for obtaining an approximate maximum likelihood estimate of C = 4 Nc, where N is the population size and c is the recombination rate. It {{has been suggested that}} observations of high linkage disequilibrium might be a good basis for rejecting a neutral model in favor of a model in which natural selection maintains genetic variation. It is found that a single sample of chromosomes, examined at two loci cannot provide sufficient information for such a test if C < 10, because with C this small, very high levels of linkage disequilibrium are not unexpected under the neutral model. In samples of size 50, it is found that, even when C is as large as 50, the distribution of linkage disequilibrium conditional on the allele frequencies is substantially different from the distribution when there is no linkage between the loci. When conditioned on the number of alleles at each locus in the sample, all of the sample statistics examined are nearly independent of θ = 4 Nµ, where µ is the neutral mutation rate...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{phenomena}} {{are observed}} in many fields (sciences and engineering) {{and are often}} studied by time-consuming computer codes. These codes are analyzed with statistical models, often called emulators. In many situations, the physical system (computer model output) may be known to satisfy inequality constraints with respect to some or all input variables. Our aim {{is to build a}} model capable of incorporating both data interpolation and inequality constraints into a Gaussian process emulator. By using a functional decomposition, we propose to approximate the original Gaussian process by a finite-dimensional Gaussian process such that all conditional simulations satisfy the inequality constraints in the whole domain. The mean, mode (maximum a posteriori) and prediction intervals (uncertainty quantification) of the conditional Gaussian process are calculated. To investigate the performance of the proposed model, some conditional simulations with inequality constraints such as boundary, monotonicity or convexity conditions are given. 1. Introduction. In the engineering activity, runs of a computer code can be expensive and time-consuming. One solution is to use a <b>statistical</b> surrogate for <b>conditioning</b> computer model outputs at some input locations (design points). Gaussian process (GP) emulator {{is one of the most}} popular choices [23]. The reason comes from the property of the GP that uncertainty quantification can be calculated. Furthermore, it has several nice properties. For example, the conditional GP at observation data (linear equality constraints) is still a GP [5]. Additionally, some inequality constraints (such as monotonicity and convexity) of output computer responses are related to partial derivatives. In such cases, the partial derivatives of the GP are also GPs. Incorporating an infinite number of linear inequality constraints into a GP emulator, the problem becomes more difficult. The reason is that the resulting conditional process is not a GP. In the literature of interpolation with inequality constraints, we find two types of meth-ods. The first one is deterministic and based on splines, which have the advantage that the inequality constraints are satisfied in the whole input domain (see e. g. [16], [24] and [25]). The second one is based on the simulation of the conditional GP by using the subdivision of the input set (see e. g. [1], [6] and [11]). In that case, the inequality constraints are satisfied in a finite number of input locations. Notice that the advantage of such method is that un-certainty quantification can be calculated. In previous work, some methodologies have been based on the knowledge of the derivatives of the GP at some input locations ([11], [21] and [26]). For monotonicity constraints with noisy data, a Bayesian approach was developed in [21]. In [11] the problem is to build a GP emulator by using the prior monotonicit...|$|R
