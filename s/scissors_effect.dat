40|$|Phosphorene, a {{recently}} fabricated two-dimensional puckered honeycomb structure of phosphorus, showed promising properties for applications in nano-electronics. In this work, we report a chemical <b>scissors</b> <b>effect</b> on phosphorene, using first-principles method. It {{was found that}} chemical species, such as H, OH, F, and Cl, can act as scissors to cut phosphorene. Phosphorus nanochains and nanoribbons can be obtained. The <b>scissors</b> <b>effect</b> results from the strong bonding between the chemical species and phosphorus atoms. Other species such as O, S and Se fail to cut phosphorene nanostructures due to their weak bonding with phosphorus. The electronic structures of the produced P-chains reveal that the hydrogenated chain is an insulator while the pristine chain is a one-dimensional Dirac material, in which the charge carriers are massless fermions travelling at an effective speed of light ∼ 8 × 105 m s− 1. The obtained zigzag phosphorene nanoribbons show either metallic or semiconducting behaviors, depending on {{the treatment of the}} edge phosphorus atoms...|$|E
40|$|The major {{electricity}} companies (the âmajorsâ) in Europe {{have not}} {{recovered from a}} significant decline in their combined market value that began in early 2008. If the causes are structural, as argued here, these companies may be {{unable or unwilling to}} finance the investments required to meet the EU policy goals of energy security, environmental sustainability, and acceptable costs. This research paper by David Robinson argues that the problems facing the European majors reflect a âscissors effectâ, which has two interpretations. On the one hand, it is a dynamic process whereby certain revenue streams fall, while costs rise, literally cutting profitability. The scissors metaphor extends to a second interpretation: that profitability is being hit â or will be soon â both upstream and downstream. The paper emphasizes underlying structural trends (stagnant demand, decarbonization and more active consumer participation) and government intervention as causes of the <b>scissors</b> <b>effect.</b> Although the structural trends seem now to be irreversible, the future of the sector still depends importantly on government decisions. This paper argues that current electricity regulations and market design are unsustainable. To address this, it is necessary to clarify the respective roles of government and markets and to design regulations and markets for a decarbonized electricity model and for the transition to the new model. Where markets do have a role to play, it is essential that they be left to play that role. The proposal draws on the original spirit of liberalization, but reflects the importance of decarbonization and the technological changes that make active consumer participation in electricity markets a reality. While the majors have to rethink corporate and regulatory strategy, their first priority should be to engage in the debate about the future role of government and competitive markets...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorene, a {{recently}} fabricated two dimensional puckered honeycomb structure of phosphorus, showed promising properties for applications of nano-electronics. In this work, we report our findings of chemical <b>scissors</b> <b>effects</b> on phosphorene, using first principles density functional theory methods. It {{was found that}} several chemical species, such as H, F, Cl and OH group, can act effectively as scissors to cut phosphorene. Phosphorus chains and nanoribbons can be obtained using different surface coverage of the chemical species. The scissor effects of these species are resulted from their strong chemical bonds with the P atoms. Species such as O, S and Se {{were not able to}} cut phosphorene nanostructures due to their lack of strong binding with P. The electronic structure calculations of the produced P-chains reveal that the saturated chain is an insulator while the pristine chain demonstrates a Dirac point at X with a Fermi velocity of 8 * 10 E 5 m/s. The obtained zigzag phosphorene nanoribbons show either metallic or semiconducting behaviors, depending on the treatment of the edge P atoms.

40|$|The {{phenomena}} of 'price scissors' and intersectoral resource transfers are {{shown to be}} amenable to analysis using offer curves from international trade theory. The nature and mechanisms of resource transfer and the incidence of the burden are clarified. In examining the sectoral funding of investment, it can be misleading to look at resource transfers: the hand that wields the <b>scissors</b> can <b>effect</b> an invisible transfer from agriculture. The theory is illustrated by reference to the Chinese economy and extended to incorporate such Chinese features as compulsory deliveries of food, consumer rationing, political constraints, and the dynamic effects of industrialization.

In a slight parody of the divine battle in Pope's Rape of the Lock, when the Baron of the poem attempts to cut a lock of Belinda's hair, the sylphs interpose their airy bodies between the blades of the <b>scissors</b> (to no <b>effect</b> whatsoever).|$|R
