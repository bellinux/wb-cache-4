Anal secretions are produced in the hindgut, and released along the posterior setae as predator deterrents In Australia, aggregations of male common blossom thrips have been observed on the petals of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis and Gossypium hirsutum; females were attracted to these groups <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> likely that the males were producing pheromones.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to {{large numbers of}} noncombatants, Bohemond's force probably numbered about 10,000, the majority on foot. Military figures of the time often imply perhaps several men-at-arms per knight (i.e., a stated force of 500 knights is assumed to contain perhaps 1,500 men-at-arms in addition), <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> reasonable that Bohemond had with him approximately 8,000 men-at-arms and 2,000 cavalry.|$|E
25|$|The Riario Palace {{became her}} {{home for the}} rest of her life. She {{decorated}} the walls with tapestries by Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi and paintings, mainly from the Venetian School and Renaissance; and almost no paintings from northern European painters, except Holbein, Van Dyck and Rubens. Her collections included very little religious subject matter and an abundance of mythological imagery, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that Christina was more interested in Rome for its ties to classical history than for its contemporary Catholic church. No Roman collection of art could match hers. There were portraits of her friends Azzolino, Bernini, Ebba Sparre, Descartes, ambassador Chanut and doctor Bourdelot.|$|E
25|$|In any case, the {{translation}} of the astronomical records required profound knowledge of the cuneiform script, the language, and the procedures, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> likely that it was done by some unidentified Chaldeans. Now, the Babylonians dated their observations in their lunisolar calendar, in which months and years have varying lengths (29 or 30 days; 12 or 13 months respectively). At the time they did not use a regular calendar (such as based on the Metonic cycle like they did later), but started a new month based on observations of the New Moon. This made it very tedious to compute the time interval between events.|$|E

25|$|In general, the Many-minds theory {{holds that}} a {{conscious}} being who observes {{the outcome of}} a random zero-sum experiment will evolve into two successors in different observer states, each of whom observes one of the possible outcomes. Moreover, the theory advises you to favour choices in such situations in proportion to the probability that they will bring good results to your various successors. But in a life-or-death case like getting into the box with Schrödinger's cat, you will only have one successor, since one of the outcomes will ensure your death. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that the Many-minds Interpretation advises you to get in the box with the cat, since it is certain that your only successor will emerge unharmed.

25|$|Dissection of Tarebia granifera showed blastula stage embryos in the brood pouches of snails {{as small}} as 8mm shell height. Small numbers of shelled embryos, {{including}} veligers, were found in snails of 10–14mm but became more plentiful in snails >14mm and especially those >20mm. Importantly, unshelled embryos (blastula, gastrula and trochophore stages) were not found in snails >16mm and the numbers of shelled embryos themselves decreased in the largest snails, >24mm. This suggests that differentiation of germinal cells in the ovary and their subsequent arrival in the brood pouch as blastulae is not a continuous process over a breeding season but occurs as one or more ‘cohorts’ or ‘pulses’ which stop before the birth rate of young snails reaches its maximum. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that while the first birth may occur in snails {{as small as}} 8mm, these are few and most juveniles are born to snails >14mm. The size of the shell of the parent at peak release of juveniles is 24.0mm.|$|E
25|$|In more detail, the FRI/FRII {{division}} {{depends on}} host-galaxy {{environment in the}} sense that the FRI/FRII transition appears at higher luminosities in more massive galaxies. FRI jets are known to be decelerating in the regions in which their radio emission is brightest, and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that the FRI/FRII transition reflects whether a jet/beam can propagate through the host galaxy without being decelerated to sub-relativistic speeds by interaction with the intergalactic medium. From analysis of relativistic beaming effects, the jets of FRII sources are known to remain relativistic (with speeds of at least 0.5c) out to the ends of the lobes. The hotspots that are usually seen in FRII sources are interpreted as being the visible manifestations of shocks formed when the fast, and therefore supersonic, jet (the speed of sound cannot exceed c/√3) abruptly terminates at the end of the source, and their spectral energy distributions are consistent with this picture. Often multiple hotspots are seen, reflecting either continued outflow after the shock or movement of the jet termination point: the overall hotspot region is sometimes called the hotspot complex.|$|E

25|$|The queen {{serves as}} the primary egg layer of the nest and begins the nest {{construction}} {{at the beginning of}} a season. If she adopt an already existing nest, it is her duty to clean out the nest and prepare it for egg laying. The queen is the top of the caste system and dominates in any dominance interaction with a subordinate. These interactions are fairly common for the queen. Queens tend to forage mainly for pulp, but they have sometimes been observed foraging for insects as well. While queens rarely forage for nectar, co-foundresses and workers do so frequently. Workers are also in charge of distributing food to other adults and larvae when they return from foraging. Workers are key in building cells and raising their walls. Non-workers, on the other hand, rarely forage themselves and depend on the collections of food that foragers bring back to the nest; this behavior defines non-workers. This caste has also been observed to leave the nest for extended periods of time to either mate or forage for themselves. They do, however, contribute to defense of the nest. There have also been examples of non-workers breaking down cell walls after larvae have matured, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> like the distinction between worker and non-worker is less clear than was previously thought. Finally, males aid in keeping the nest cool in hot temperatures by fanning their wings and they rely heavily on the food that foragers bring back to the nest. They sometimes swarm the foragers in order to get the nectar, pulp, and insects that the foragers bring.|$|E

500|$|Zenithia, {{also called}} Zenith Castle, Zenith, or [...] in Japanese, is a {{floating}} castle that first appears in Dragon QuestIV; {{it is used}} as a descriptor for several elements in Dragon QuestIV, V and VI. Its appearance in all three games has led to the games being described as the Zenithia or Tenkū trilogy, despite different geographical layouts {{in each of the three}} games' worlds. Horii explained that a trilogy was never the intention: [...] "Each Dragon Quest title represents a fresh start and a new story, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> too much of a connection between the games in the series.

500|$|Writing {{in retrospect}} for Daily Express, {{reviewer}} Simon Gage {{was critical of}} Minogue's lack of musical progression, charisma, and thought that she lacked a [...] "great voice". He stated [...] "There are dodgy tracks and the “voice”, more processed than a tinned pea, does start to grate but it’s still pretty good." [...] He awarded the box set three stars. British journalist Paul Du Noyer reviewed the box set, and complimented Minogue's Parlophone work as [...] "ambiguous pop". However, he stated [...] "There’s a lot of ambitious pop in here, but no conceptual overreach. Not even her experience of breast cancer was allowed to surface in Kylie’s subsequent material: lyrically, it was straight back to business. It seems unlikely such a 20-year lucky streak could be sustained {{without a lot of}} shrewd decisions by Minogue herself. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that everyone is right after all: Kylie is A Good Thing, and here is just enough of it." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the judges}} {{explained}} that the court had jurisdiction because the case brought up a legal issue, that of statutory interpretation (whether the 1911 Act {{could be used to}} enact the 1949 Act), rather than being examination of parliamentary proceedings. Lord Bingham noted that the bill was not enacted by both Houses of Parliament, as it was in Pickin, and that [...] "the appellants have raised a question of law which cannot, as such, be resolved by Parliament ... <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to me necessary that the courts should resolve it, and that to do so involves no breach of constitutional propriety". Lord Nicholls distinguished Jackson from Pickin as a case examining the correct interpretation of the 1911 Act, an evaluation for the courts rather than Parliament; Lord Hope concurred, noting that there was no absolute prohibition on courts evaluating the validity of Acts of Parliament; and Lord Carswell agreed that the case raised [...] "a question of law which falls within the scope of courts of law carrying out their regular function". All nine judges accepted that the court had jurisdiction to consider whether the 1949 Act was valid.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} death of Ianto Jones during Torchwoods third series, a {{campaign}} to bring him back was started through networking sites such as LiveJournal, Twitter and Facebook. The resulting website, www.saveiantojones.com, has organised a protest which encourages fans to send coffee, along with postcards and letters of complaint, to the BBC, a reference to Ianto's status as the [...] "coffee boy". Via the Save Ianto Jones website, fans are also campaigning {{to raise money for the}} BBC charity Children in Need in honour of the character. The fundraising site states that [...] "Though we, his devoted fans, still hope that he'll come back ... we mourn him. In the series, he died saving the children of Earth; <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> fitting to honour his memory by helping the Children in Need." [...] Torchwood Magazine reported that the site had raised nearly £4,000, with individual donations ranging from £2 to £50. John Barrowman described the charity campaign as [...] "a fun way to mourn Ianto" [...] and stated that it was [...] "the kind of thing that's really appreciated". Gareth David-Lloyd was flattered by the strong fan reaction, saying it is [...] "satisfying in drama when you create such an emotional response, because that's what you set out to do in the first place". He praised the fan donations, claiming [...] "So far, they've raised about £3,000 for Children in Need, and £1,000 for Lluest Horse and Pony Trust in West Wales, which I'm a patron of, so that's got to be a good thing". Coventry Telegraph records that by 21 July 2009, £4,172 had been donated in Ianto's name.|$|E
2500|$|There {{seems to}} be a certain logic in female homosexuality.
