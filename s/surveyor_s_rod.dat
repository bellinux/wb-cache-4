Our goal was to find and isolate positive and negative anomaly pairs which would indicate magnetization of a single source body. From these anomalies we could compute {{the direction of the}} magnetizing vector and subsequently the location of the magnetic pole existing at the time of magnetization. We found nine suitable anomaly pairs and from these we computed four North and 3 South poles with two at approximately 60 degrees north latitude.

5000|$|Each {{township}} was {{subdivided into}} 36 sq mi sections numbered boustrophedonically, as {{established by the}} Act of May 18, 1796. [...] Under the Act of 1816, Joseph Wampler surveyed the riverfront into long lots of about 160 acre each, numbered 1 to 93, and officially called “River Tracts”. [...] The private claims of the British and French era settlers were surveyed in 1817 by deputy <b>surveyor</b> <b>S.</b> Carpenter. The partial sections left after the River Tracts were called “Fractional Sections”. The Act of 1816 set aside section 16 of each township as School Lands for benefit of schools in each township. These sections were eventually sold. Town lots in Perrysburg were also laid out in 1816, providing less than two sections of land in lots less than ¼ acre each. [...] Land sales were through the Wooster Land Office in the Canton Land District.|$|R

40|$|The Viking Orbiters {{determined}} that the surface of Mars northern residual cap is water ice. Many researchers have related observed atmospheric water vapor abundances to seasonal exchange between reservoirs such as the polar caps, but {{the extent to which}} the exchange between the surface and the atmosphere remains uncertain. Early studies of the ice coverage and albedo of the northern residual Martian polar cap using Mariner 9 and Viking images reported that there were substantial internannual differences in ice deposition on the polar cap, a result that suggested a highly variable Martian climate. However, some of the data used in these studies were obtained at differing values of heliocentric solar longitude (Ls). Reevaluation of this dataset in indicated that the residual cap undergoes seasonal brightening throughout the summer, and indicated that this process repeats from year to year. In this study we continue this work with data acquired with Mars Global <b>Surveyor</b> <b>s</b> Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) and Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) instruments.

30|$|Next, we {{evaluated}} whether CT modification on sgRNA {{led to a}} higher genome editing efficiency. We delivered each AAVS 1 sgRNA structure together with in vitro transcribed Cas 9 mRNA into K 562 cells by electroporation and analyzed genome disruption frequencies by <b>Surveyor</b> assay (Fig. <b>S</b> 2 A). Consistent with the improved stability, CTsgRNA led to higher insertion or/and deletion (indel) frequencies (26.90 %) compared to control sgRNA (15.29 %), while the sgRNAs with other structures had an editing efficiency lower than control (Fig. S 2 A). Improved gene editing efficiency using CTsgRNAs was also obtained at the VEGFA, EMX 1, HBB and PD 1 loci in K 562 cells, with indel frequency quantified using tracking of indels by decomposition (TIDE) analysis (Figs.  1 C and <b>S</b> 3), <b>Surveyor</b> assay (Fig. <b>S</b> 2 B) and chip-based QuantStudio 3 D digital PCR (Fig. S 4).|$|R
