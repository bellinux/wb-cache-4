5|$|The Lost Age {{contains}} both random monster encounters and compulsory {{battles that}} advance the story. When a battle begins, a separate <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> brought {{up where the}} enemy party is on the opposing side and the player’s party is on the battling side. While a battle being is conducted, the characters and background swirl around and change positions in a pseudo-3D effect.|$|E
5|$|The first {{adaptation}} of Hellblazer ever filmed for the <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} scenes in the documentary feature film The Mindscape of Alan Moore, which was shot in early 2002. The dramatization consists of the John Constantine character wandering through London and, in the film ending, experiencing a mystical epiphany of sorts.|$|E
5|$|A Gothic {{screen was}} also {{added to the}} Norman nave at Peterborough, {{but this is an}} {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. The <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> composed of three enormous open arches, the two outer ones being much wider than that which frames the central door. The overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by the later porch and the fact that two towers of very different height pop up from behind the screen. Despite this, it is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of Gothic, revealing the enormous diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E
50|$|On 9 April 2013 it was {{announced}} that the Jumbotron <b>screens</b> <b>were</b> to be replaced, the previous <b>screens</b> <b>were</b> inferior and had become pixelated.|$|R
50|$|Platform {{destination}} LED <b>screens</b> <b>are</b> installed, {{along with}} a main departures and arrivals information board. Each of Platforms 1-7 has its own screen showing departures from that platform. <b>Screens</b> <b>are</b> also present behind the wall for all platforms from 3-6. In addition, several other <b>screens</b> <b>are</b> also visible for general information.|$|R
50|$|Trommel <b>screens</b> <b>are</b> {{cheaper to}} produce than {{vibrating}} <b>screens.</b> They <b>are</b> vibration free which causes less noise than vibrating <b>screens.</b> Trommel <b>screens</b> <b>are</b> more mechanically robust than vibrating screens {{allowing it to}} last longer under mechanical stress.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time as these events, the Simpsons are {{attending}} an air show held at the base, before the signal on the big <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> interrupted by Bob, who threatens to detonate the nuclear bomb unless Springfield disables all television broadcasts. Upon hearing the announcement, everyone flees the airfield in panic, except for Bart and Lisa. Unable to locate Bob, Mayor Quimby decides to give in to Bob's ultimatum.|$|E
5|$|Ferb {{was given}} a simplistic {{structure}} so that young audiences {{would be able to}} draw him easily. As with the other characters of Phineas and Ferb, Ferb's design is constructed of geometric shapes in homage to animator Tex Avery. Ferb's head is based on a rectangle with a wider top than bottom. A square is used for his nose, and an egg-shaped oval is used for his eyes. The eye furthest from the <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> always drawn larger than the other. Povenmire uses a nine-step process to draw Ferb, starting with his head and ending with touch ups.|$|E
5|$|Ono {{was also}} an {{experimental}} filmmaker who made 16 short films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply No. 4, {{often referred to as}} Bottoms. The five-and-a-half-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks walking on a treadmill. The <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the gluteal cleft and the horizontal gluteal crease. The soundtrack consists of interviews with those who are being filmed, as well as those considering joining the project. In 1996, the watch manufacturing company Swatch produced a limited edition watch that commemorated this film.|$|E
50|$|Terministic <b>screens</b> <b>is</b> {{significant}} {{to the process}} of rhetorical criticism, as well as understanding rhetoric, because terministic <b>screens</b> <b>are</b> a conduit to understanding reality.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{a single}} screen cinema, the {{auditorium}} was subdivided in 1982 to create two additional auditoria. The new <b>screens</b> <b>were</b> {{suspended from the}} ceiling, meaning the main <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> not reduced.|$|R
40|$|Network <b>screening</b> <b>is</b> {{the first}} step in the site safety {{improvement}} process. The product of network <b>screening</b> <b>is</b> a list of sites that are ranked by priority for the conduct of detailed engineering studies. In turn, cost-effective projects are formulated from the studies. With the purpose of laying the foundation for improved network screening, the role of network <b>screening</b> <b>is</b> clarified, and how project cost and safety benefit can be antic-ipated at the time of <b>screening</b> <b>is</b> examined. The strengths and weaknesses of alternative assumptions on which the anticipation of safety benefit can be based are discussed. A way to guard against misallocation of resources due to the randomness of accident counts is suggested, and a method for finding peak sites within road sections <b>is</b> proposed. <b>Screening</b> <b>is</b> the low-cost examination of all entities of a population. Thus, for example, administering a mammogram to all women over 50 <b>is</b> <b>screening</b> for breast cancer. The aim of <b>screening</b> <b>is</b> to select a relatively small subgroup from a large population, members o...|$|R
5|$|Other {{blood tests}} are often taken to help {{understand}} a person's general health and risk {{factors that may}} contribute to heart disease. These often include a full blood count investigating for anaemia, and basic metabolic panel that may reveal any disturbances in electrolytes. A coagulation <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> often required {{to ensure that the}} right level of anticoagulation is given. Fasting lipids and fasting blood glucose (or an HbA1c level) are often ordered to evaluate a person's cholesterol and diabetes status, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Sabre Wulf is an action-adventure game by Ultimate Play the Game, {{initially}} released for the ZX Spectrum {{home computer}} in 1984. The player navigates the pith-helmeted Sabreman through a 2D jungle maze while collecting amulet pieces {{to bypass the}} guardian at its exit. The player does not receive explicit guidance on how to play and is left to decipher the game's objectives through trial and error. Sabreman moves between the maze's 256 connected screens by touching the border where one screen ends and another begins. Each <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> filled with colourful flora, enemies that spawn at random, and occasional collectibles.|$|E
5|$|Special {{abilities}} are another {{important aspect of}} Chocobo Racing. Before each race, the player is prompted to assign a special ability to the selected character. During a race, the player can only activate the chosen special ability when the meter in the upper left-hand corner of the <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> full. After using the special ability, the player must wait for the meter to recharge to use it again.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 2013 it was {{announced}} that the Jumbotron <b>screens</b> <b>were</b> to be replaced; the previous <b>screens</b> <b>were</b> inferior and had become pixelated. On 16 July 2014 the club paid a lasting tribute to Sandy Jardine by renaming the Govan Stand in his honour.|$|R
40|$|Neonatal/newborn {{haemoglobinopathy}} <b>screening</b> <b>is</b> {{being performed}} in {{an increasing number}} of European countries since changing patterns of immigration have led to significant numbers of neonates at risk of sickle cell disease. The purpose of <b>screening</b> <b>is</b> to improve management of sickle cell disease through early parental education and the institution of prophylaxis against infection. Some haemoglobinopathy <b>screening</b> pro-grammes <b>are</b> stand-alone, while others are integrated into a neonatal screening programme for metabolic disorders. Despite the logistic problems and economic constraints, neonatal haemoglobinopathy <b>screening</b> <b>is</b> also being gradually introduced in a number of African countries...|$|R
3000|$|... 95  % (£ 21, 000) of {{the annual}} cost {{incurred}} by USS <b>screening</b> <b>was</b> spent proving that referred infants had normal hips. Only 5  % (£ 1, 180) of the cost incurred by USS <b>screening</b> <b>was</b> spent on infants with DDH.|$|R
5|$|Tales of Graces {{consists}} {{primarily of}} two major areas: the field map and a battle screen. The field map is a realistically scaled 3D environment traversed by foot. On the field maps, various skits between the characters can be viewed. They involve animated character portraits, subtitles, and full voice acting. Skits concern anything from character development to side details. The battle <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> a 3D representation of an area, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E
5|$|The Lost Levels is an unlockable bonus in the 1999 Game Boy Color game Super Mario Bros. Deluxe. The {{game was}} edited for the {{handheld}} device: the visible <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> cropped and some features are omitted, {{such as the}} wind and five bonus worlds. The Lost Levels was rereleased in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance on the third volume of Nintendo's Japan-only Famicom Mini compilation cartridges.|$|E
5|$|The {{gear and}} dial {{in the bottom}} left of the game <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> related to the Kotarou's Rewrite ability. The dial moves forward {{whenever}} this ability is used, and the outcome of certain scenes is determined by how much the dial has moved. Throughout most of the game, the text is presented in a dialog box on the lower portion of the game screen, but this is changed for the Terra scenario, where the text is overlaid across the entire screen.|$|E
50|$|As for the screens, {{perforated}} plate screens or mesh <b>screens</b> <b>are</b> usually used. Perforated plate <b>screen</b> <b>are</b> rolled and welded for strength. This design contains fewer ridges {{which makes it}} easier for the cleaning process. On the other hand, mesh <b>screen</b> <b>are</b> replaceable as it is susceptible to wear and tear compared to perforated screen. In addition, screw cleaning work for this design is more intensive as objects tend to get wedged in the mesh ridges.|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} process and transfer characteristics for solid state radiographic image transducers (radiographic amplifier <b>screens)</b> <b>are</b> described. These <b>screens</b> <b>are</b> {{for use in}} realtime nondestructive evaluation procedures that require large format radiographic images with contrast and resolution capabilities unavailable with conventional fluoroscopic <b>screens.</b> The <b>screens</b> <b>are</b> suitable for in-motion, on-line radiographic inspection by means of closed circuit television. Experimental {{effort was made to}} improve image quality and response to low energy (5 kV and up) X-rays...|$|R
40|$|A failed Johnson <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> {{sent to the}} {{laboratory}} for analysis. The <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> found to have failed at the flange hub – screen joint. Analysis showed that the failure was due to inadequate welding of the flange hub with the ribs/stiffeners of the <b>screen.</b> The failure <b>was</b> by sudden overload. There were no indications of delayed failure like fatigue or stress corrosion cracking. Semi-quantitative analysis by EDX showed that the helical coil of the <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> made of SS 304 steel while the ribs/stiffener were made of SS 316 steel...|$|R
5|$|The top {{screen of}} the Nintendo 3DS {{displays}} hearts, an energy gauge, and an action icon. Link's life energy decreases {{when he is}} hit by an enemy and can be replenished by collecting hearts {{that can be found}} in a variety of ways, such as defeating enemies or breaking pots. The energy gauge governs item and ability usage, it depletes on use and replenishes over time. The action icon notifies the player of interactive objects. A map of the kingdoms is displayed on the bottom screen of the Nintendo 3DS, showing Link's current position and marked locations. The bottom <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> also used to view and select Link's gear and items.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} Pokémon {{role-playing}} games released for handheld consoles, FireRed and LeafGreen are in third-person, overhead perspective. The main <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> an overworld, {{in which the}} player navigates the protagonist. Here a menu interface may be accessed, in which the player may configure his or her Pokémon, items, and gameplay settings. When the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the player's Pokémon and the engaged Pokémon. During a battle, the player may select a move {{for his or her}} Pokémon to perform, use an item, switch his or her active Pokémon, or attempt to flee. All Pokémon have hit points (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pokémon faints, all of the player's Pokémon involved in the battle receive a certain amount of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon may level up.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} each song, {{a result}} <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> {{displayed}} to player, and his or her performance is rated with a letter grade, a numerical score, and a percentage that represents his or her accuracy. The player is awarded a number of fans and in-game money for his or her performance. The number of fans determine the idols' ranking, and as the player's idols increase in ranking, more items become available for purchase. These items can then be used to customize the game's appearance or adjust gameplay elements, such as straightening the Melody Lines' shapes or causing the player to gain fans quicker. Finishing a song also earns the player Memories with the idols who perform the song, which can be used in the Star of Festa game mode.|$|E
50|$|Big <b>Screen</b> Derby <b>was</b> {{installed}} in 2007. The <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> {{a partnership between}} the BBC, Derby City Council, the University of Derby and LOCOG and was located in the Market Place next to the Assembly Rooms. In early September 2013, the <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> removed by Derby City Council in a cost-cutting exercise, although its return in some form has not been ruled out.|$|R
50|$|Screens in <b>screening</b> plant <b>are</b> used {{to group}} process {{particles}} into ranges by size. These size ranges are also called grades. Dewatering <b>screens</b> <b>are</b> used to remove {{water from the}} product. <b>Screens</b> can <b>be</b> static, or mechanically vibrated. <b>Screen</b> decks can <b>be</b> made from different materials such as high tensile steel, stainless steel, or polyethylene.|$|R
5000|$|Small changes {{occurred}} in 2007: The stadium {{was chosen to}} host three matches of the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In these circumstances, two giant <b>screens</b> <b>were</b> installed in two corners of the open stand, and the <b>screens</b> <b>were</b> retained after the competition.|$|R
5|$|Combat {{takes place}} in real-time. Located {{at the bottom of}} the <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> a power bar, a gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy when attacking. Swinging a weapon causes the gauge to empty and then quickly recharge, {{allowing}} that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a weapon increases its skill level to a maximum of eight, unlocking a new special attack with each level. Weapons are upgraded with Weapon Orbs, which are found in dungeons or earned by defeating certain bosses. The player takes each Orb to a blacksmith, located in most towns, who uses it to reforge one weapon.|$|E
5|$|Folding screen: The folding <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} {{furniture}} consisting of several frames or panels. Screens date back to China during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty period (771–256 BC). These were initially one-panel screens in contrast to folding screens. Folding screens were invented during the Han Dynasty (206 BC - AD 220). Depictions of those folding screens {{have been found in}} Han Dynasty era tombs, such as one in Zhucheng, Shandong Province. During the Tang Dynasty, folding screens were considered ideal ornaments for many painters to display their paintings and calligraphy on. Many artists painted on paper or silk and applied it onto the folding screen. The landscape paintings on folding screens reached its height during the Song Dynasty (960–1279).|$|E
5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} of the ride where wrap-around projection is used, each robotic arm continues its steady movement on the track but is met by its own individual parabolic projection screen and projector traveling {{at exactly the same}} pace. Each projection section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each robotic arm as they pass by - and each <b>screen</b> <b>is</b> large enough that when in front of each ride bench its edges cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The robotic arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection, whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each projection section of the ride is approximately the same length, as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized projection screen turntable for a set period of time.|$|E
50|$|In 1560, {{the choir}} <b>screen</b> <b>was</b> removed {{as part of}} changes arising from the Counter-Reformation and the {{interior}} rebuilt by Giorgio Vasari. As a result, there was damage to the church's decoration {{and most of the}} altars previously located on the <b>screen</b> <b>were</b> lost.|$|R
50|$|During 2012-13 {{the main}} {{auditorium}}, already the largest screen and auditorium in Cornwall, {{was subject to}} a £1.5 million transformation. Capacity increased to 650 and includes circle, stalls and box seats. To {{increase the number of}} screens from 4 to 6 the auditorium was partitioned, and two <b>screens</b> <b>were</b> placed underneath the circle. This was in addition to other work taken out on the other screens. All six <b>screens</b> <b>were</b> officially opened on 21 July 2013. All 6 <b>screens</b> <b>are</b> licensed for alcohol consumption.|$|R
50|$|Overscreening, {{also called}} {{unnecessary}} <b>screening,</b> <b>is</b> {{the performance of}} medical screening without a medical indication to do so. <b>Screening</b> <b>is</b> a medical test in a healthy person who is showing no symptoms of a disease and is intended to detect a disease so that a person may prepare to respond to it. <b>Screening</b> <b>is</b> indicated in people who have some threshold risk for getting a disease, but is not indicated in people who are unlikely to develop a disease. Overscreening {{is a type of}} unnecessary health care.|$|R
