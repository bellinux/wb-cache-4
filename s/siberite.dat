50|$|The game's story {{revolves}} around an extraterrestrial mineral, <b>Siberite,</b> that can catalyze cold fusion {{and serve as}} fuel for an alien artifact. <b>Siberite</b> and the artifact - named EON - are discovered by a US expedition to Russia during World War I. EON is revealed {{to be a time}} machine capable of sending objects into the past, but {{by the time of the}} discovery, <b>Siberite</b> stocks are exhausted and research stops. Then in the new millennium vast deposits of the mineral are found in Siberia, and Americans are able to extract enough of it for small-scale time-travel.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. {{comes up}} with a plan to send a small force two million years back in time. There it will mine the <b>Siberite</b> and {{transport}} it over the Bering Land Bridge to Alaska, into what will one day be in American hands. The best troops are selected, briefed, and told that it is a one-way trip back through time.|$|E
50|$|The crew, {{transferred}} to SS <b>Siberote,</b> {{were taken to}} Makassar City, then to Surabaya (Soerabaja), whence they were reassigned.|$|R
50|$|On 20 January 1942, she {{assisted}} in the rescue of the crew of S-36 after she ran aground on Taku Reef in the Makassar Strait.

After the rescue by the Dutch merchant ship <b>Siberote,</b> Sargo headed for Java, and arrived at Soerabaja on 25 January.|$|R
