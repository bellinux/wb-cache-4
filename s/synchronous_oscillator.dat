At higher bit rates however, {{there is a need for}} a phase correction or phase cancelling network, if the BER variations with respect to hard wired case must be confined to less than 0. 2 dB with IF offsets of ± 30 kHz. At bit rates higher than 100 Mbit/s, the multiply by four process in a QPSK modem deteriorates the signal-to-noise ratio by more than 15 dB (18 dB at Eb/No = 6. 4 dB) and the synchronization signal-to-noise ratio at the input to the SO drops below 0 dB (! 5 dB at Eb/No = 6. 4 dB). This reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio reduces the tracking band of the SO which in turn increases the phase shift per unit frequency offset...|$|E
40|$|Spread Spectrum {{has become}} a popular digital {{modulation}} scheme in recent years. The advantages the scheme offers, {{at the expense of}} bandwidth, make it attractive in a multitude of commercial applications. The most common method, and the one of interest in this thesis, of generating Spread Spectrum is multiplying the data waveform by a wideband, digitally generated waveform. This is referred to as Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum. The characteristics of Spread Spectrum systems are determined by the spreading waveform. A common group of spreading waveforms, and the ones dealt with in this text, are the maximal-length sequences. These are a class of pseudorandom waveforms. Their properties include a two valued autocorrelation function with its maximum value at no code-phase offset. This allows for multiple access to a single resource and the suppression of multi-path interference as adjacent codes have little effect on each other. This same property requires that the receiver must accurately align its replica of the spreading waveform to the transmitted waveform in order to despread the received waveform and demodulate the data. Common methods of synchronisation use a two pronged solution. Firstly the correct code phase is determined. This is referred to as code acquisition. Secondly the clocking frequency of the received waveform must be resolved in order to precisely align the two sequences. This is referred to as code tracking. Receivers therefore tend to be complex and expensive. This thesis involved the investigation of two pseudo-noise synchronisation networks proposed by J. G. van de Groenendaal. These networks offered both code acquisition and tracking in a single robust loop. The investigation, done in co-operation with J [...] G. van de Groenendaal, persued two avenues. Firstly the loops were simulated. This method allows for the easy alteration of system parameters. Valuable insight into the loop dynamics can thus be gained. Secondly the loops were built on the bench. This allows for the practical confirmation {{of the results of the}} simulation. Both synchronisation loops were based on variations of the maximal likelihood phase detector. This phase detector is formed by taking the product of the first derivative with respect to time of the receiver's replica of the transmitted waveform and the received waveform. The initial investigation involved calculating the phase information generated by this phase discriminator for a variety of code-phase and frequency offsets. It was found that there were two stable points in the baseband Spread Spectrum search grid, a grid where a cell consists of a certain code-phase and frequency offset. These stable points existed at no frequency offset, which means that the loops should track the input frequency, and a one or no code-phase offset, which means that the loops should acquire either code-phase. A simple model where the novel synchronisation loop's conditions are represented by a 'ball' resting on the baseband Spread Spectrum search grid as expressed in terms of the integrated phase output of the maximal likelihood phase discriminator was developed. In this model the 'ball' will roll around the surface until one of the two stable points is entered. This describes quite accurately the paths the novel synchronisation loop does in fact take through the baseband Spread Spectrum search grid. The first loop is based directly on the maximal likelihood phase detector. The differentiator is thus in the feedback path of the loop. This results in the loop being unstable and parameter sensitive. Moving the differentiator into the input path, as in the second loop, resulted in a more stable loop. This loop therefore offered a complete, simple synchronisation solution. The novel synchronisation loop with the differentiator in the input path was found to operate at signal-to- noise ratios of - 2 dB. Improvement of this signal-to-noise ratio does not offer any advantages in a Spread Spectrum environment as the loop needs to work in a coherent system where the radio frequency carrier must be resolved before the receiver's pseudo-noise sequence can be synchronised. A radio frequency carrier cannot be easily resolved at signal-to-noise ratios lower than O dB. The loop was further adapted to operate in the data environment. Under conditions of data modulation the received waveform is randomly inverted by the data. This results in the loop being driven out of lock. The phase discriminator's slope, having locked on a certain polarity, cannot track an input of the opposite polarity. The loop was adapted by including detection circuitry that would monitor the state of the receiver with respect to the incoming data waveform and alter the polarity of the of the discriminator's slope where necessary. During the prototyping of the loop on the bench certain implementations were investigated. These included the signed edge detector, a wideband low noise implementation of a square wave differentiator, and the <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillator,</b> a form of injection locked oscillator. The loop was shown to achieve synchronisation. The novel synchronisation loop with the differentiator in the input path is thus capable of synchronising two maximal-length sequences in both code-phase and frequency...|$|E

40|$|Synchronization in {{networks}} of coupled oscillators {{is known to}} be largely determined by the spectral and symmetry properties of the interaction network. Here we leverage this relation to study a class of networks for which the threshold coupling strength for global synchronization is the lowest among all networks with the same number of nodes and links. These networks, defined as being uniform, complete, and multi-partite (UCM), appear at each of an infinite sequence of network-complement transitions in a larger class of networks characterized by having near-optimal thresholds for global synchronization. We show that the distinct symmetry structure of the UCM networks, which by design are optimized for global synchronizability, often leads to formation of clusters of <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillators,</b> and that such states can coexist with the state of global synchronization.

A simple example is diffusive coupling [3]; another possibility is coupling which is dependent upon the correlation between {{some or all of}} the variables. As mentioned, the technique will break down once the oscillators become desynchronised, as the dependence of state on parameter(s) will no longer be smooth. However, if the oscillators form several clusters [14, 36], it may be possible to apply the ideas presented here to each cluster, as the dependence of state on parameter(s) within each cluster should still be smooth. Ideally, this reparametrisation would be done adaptively as clusters form, in the same way that algorithms for numerical integration adapt as the solution varies [30]. Alternatively, if a single oscillator ‘breaks away’ [27], the methods presented here could be used on the remaining <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillators,</b> with the variables describing the state of the rogue oscillator also fully resolved. More generally, there are systems in which it is not necessarily the state of an oscillator that is a smooth function of the heterogeneous parameter, but the parameters describing the distribution of states[37, 38], and the ideas presented here could also be useful in this case.|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{nonlinear}} oscillations {{is important in}} a variety of physical and biological contexts (especially in neuroscience). Synchronization of oscillators has been a problem of interest in recent years. In networks of nearest neighbor coupled oscillators it is possible to obtain synchrony between oscillators, but also a variety of constant phase shifts between 0 and pi. We coin these phase shifts intermediate stable phase-locked states. In neuroscience, both individual neurons and populations of neurons can behave as complex nonlinear oscillators. Intermediate stable phase-locked states are shown to be obtainable between individual oscillators and populations of identical oscillators. These intermediate stable phase-locked states may be useful in the construction of central pattern generators: autonomous neural cicuits responsible for motor behavior. In large chains and two-dimenional arrays of oscillators, intermediate stable phase-locked states provide a mechanism to produce waves and patterns that cannot be obtained in traditional network models. A particular pattern of interest is known as an anti-wave. This pattern corresponds to the collision of two waves from opposite ends of an oscillator chain. This wave may be relevant in the spinal central pattern generators of various fish. Anti-wave solutions in both conductance based neuron models and phase oscillator models are analyzed. It is shown that such solutions arise in phase oscillator models in which the nonlinearity (interaction function) contains both higher order odd and even Fourier modes. These modes are prominent in pairs of <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillators</b> which lose stability in a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. ...|$|R

40|$|Computing with {{networks}} of <b>synchronous</b> <b>oscillators</b> has attracted wide-spread attention as novel materials and device topologies have enabled realization of compact, scalable and low-power coupled oscillatory systems. Of particular interest are compact and low-power relaxation oscillators {{that have been}} recently demonstrated using MIT (metal- insulator-transition) devices using properties of correlated oxides. This paper presents {{an analysis of the}} dynamics and synchronization of a system of two such identical coupled relaxation oscillators implemented with MIT devices. We focus on two implementations of the oscillator: (a) a D-D configuration where complementary MIT devices (D) are connected in series to provide oscillations and (b) a D-R configuration where it is composed of a resistor (R) in series with a voltage-triggered state changing MIT device (D). The MIT device acts like a hysteresis resistor with different resistances in the two different states. The synchronization dynamics of such a system has been analyzed with purely charge based coupling using a resistive (Rc) and a capacitive (Cc) element in parallel. It is shown that in a D-D configuration symmetric, identical and capacitively coupled relaxation oscillator system synchronizes to an anti-phase locking state, whereas when coupled resistively the system locks in phase. Further, we demonstrate that for certain range of values of Rc and Cc, a bistable system is possible which can have potential applications in associative computing. In D-R configuration, we demonstrate the existence of rich dynamics including non-monotonic flows and complex phase relationship governed by the ratios of the coupling impedance. Finally, the developed theoretical formulations have been shown to explain experimentally measured waveforms of such pairwise coupled relaxation oscillators.

A computer-aided perturbation analysis is devel-oped for such systems, where analytically tractable equations {{of the clock}} phases are reduced from experimental data reflecting all circuit details. Using this reduction, a theory is constructed to ex-plain the underlying mechanism of the synchronization in SDOs. It systematically explains the observed phenomena, the existence and stability of the (mutually) synchronized states, and the transi-tion from the in-phase synchronized state to the out-of-phase (but still synchronized) state. Furthermore, the present theory of phase reduction provides a new design principle of coupled oscillators based on “the equation”; a precise delay control (less than the gate delay) circuit can be designed in a simple and general form.

When a parameter is varied this fully symmetric dynamical state can lose its stability, and the main {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate which type of dynamical behavior is expected to be observed once the loss of stability has occurred. The essential tool is a classification of Lyapunov exponents based on the symmetry of the underlying problem. This classification is crucial in the derivation of the analytical results but it also allows an efficient computation of the dominant Lyapunov exponent associated with each symmetry type. We show how these dominant exponents determine the stability of invariant sets possessing various instantaneous symmetries and this leads to the idea of symmetry breaking bifurcations of chaotic attractors. Finally the results and ideas are illustrated for several systems of coupled oscillators...|$|R
40|$|In {{terrestrial}} television transmission multiple paths of various lengths can occur between the transmitter and the receiver. Such paths occur because of reflections from objects outside the direct transmission path. The multipath signals {{arriving at the}} receiver are all detected along with the intended signal causing time displaced replicas called 'ghosts' {{to appear on the}} television picture. With an increasing number of people living within built up areas, ghosting is becoming commonplace and therefore deghosting is becoming increasingly important. This thesis uses a deterministic time domain approach to deghosting, resulting in a simple {{solution to the problem of}} removing ghosts. A new video detector is presented which reduces the <b>synchronous</b> detector local <b>oscillator</b> phase error, caused by any practical size of ghost, to a lower level than has ever previously been achieved. From the new detector, dispersion of the video signal is minimised and a known closed-form time domain description of the individual ghost components within the detected video is subsequently obtained. Developed from mathematical descriptions of the detected video, a new specific deghoster filter structure is presented which is capable of removing both inphase (I) and also the phase quadrature (Q) induced ghost signals derived from the VSB operation. The new deghoster filter requires much less hardware than any previous deghoster which is capable of removing both I and Q ghost components. A new channel identification algorithm was also required and written which is based upon simple correlation techniques to find the delay and complex amplitude characteristics of individual ghosts. The result of the channel identification is then passed to the new I and Q deghoster filter for ghost cancellation. Generated from the research work performed for this thesis, five papers have been published. ...|$|R
