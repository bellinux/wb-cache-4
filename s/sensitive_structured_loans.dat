The SS nuclease <b>sensitive</b> <b>structures</b> are dependent on the presence of the extruded cruciform and exhibit a degree of sequence independence. Their appearance depends upon the combined effects of slightly lower than neutral pH and superhelical coiling above the minimum required to drive the extrusion of the d(AT) n cruciform arms. The nuclease <b>sensitive</b> <b>structure</b> is therefore underwound with respect to the B conformation and contains protonated bases...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{influence}} of temperature on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor response during dew point calibration is investigated. The aim is to present a compensation method to eliminate temperature impact on frequency acquisition. A new <b>sensitive</b> <b>structure</b> is proposed with double QCMs. One is kept {{in contact with the}} environment, whereas the other is not exposed to the atmosphere. There is a thermal conductivity silicone pad between each crystal and a refrigeration device to keep a uniform temperature condition. A differential frequency method is described in detail and is applied to calibrate the frequency characteristics of QCM at the dew point of − 3. 75 °C. It is worth noting that frequency changes of two QCMs were approximately opposite when temperature conditions were changed simultaneously. The results from continuous experiments show that the frequencies of two QCMs as the dew point moment was reached have strong consistency and high repeatability, leading {{to the conclusion that the}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>structure</b> can calibrate dew points with high reliability...|$|R

A novel MEMS biomimetic acoustic pressure gradient <b>sensitive</b> <b>structure</b> {{was designed and}} fabricated by mimicking the mechanically coupled tympana of the fly. Firstly, the analytic representation formulas of the resultant force and resultant moment of the incoming plane wave acting on the structure were derived. After that, structure modal analysis was performed and {{the results show that}} the structure has out-of-phase and in-phase vibration modes, and the corresponding eigenfrequency is decided by the stiffness of vertical torsional beam and horizontal beam respectively. Acoustic-structural coupled analysis was performed and the results show that phase difference and amplitude difference between the responses of the two square diaphragms of the <b>sensitive</b> <b>structure</b> are effectively enlarged through mechanical coupling beam. The phase difference and amplitude difference increase with increasing incident angle and can be used to distinguish the direction of sound arrival.

40|$|Tunnels {{for the new}} Barcelona Metro Line 9 {{are being}} {{constructed}} in a densely built urban area, close to <b>sensitive</b> <b>structures.</b> The paper presents a case history involving tunnelling in difficult mixed geological conditions belowan existing Metro Line (Line 4). Tunnelling was performed with a dual EPB boring machine and the closed mode of operation was prescribed beneath all <b>sensitive</b> <b>structures.</b> Despite this original prescription, an open mode excavation (with a partially filled pressure chamber) had to be adopted to avoid the interruption of the boring process in the area below the existing Metro Line 4. The paper describes the geological conditions of the site, presents some of the ground movement observations prior to the change of excavation mode and discusses the rationale that allowed {{the change in the}} prescribed tunnelling mode as well as the results obtained. Observations of displacements during the excavation in open mode confirmed that no soil inrush into the head chamber occurred and that in addition, with the new excavation procedure, ground movements were reduced significantly.

40|$|AbstractTransformational elastodynamics {{can be used}} {{to protect}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>structures</b> from harmful waves and vibrations. By {{designing}} the material properties in a region around the <b>sensitive</b> <b>structure,</b> a cloak, the incident waves can be redirected as to cause minimal or no harmful response on the pertinent structure. In this paper, we consider such transformational cloaking built up by a suitably designed metamaterial exhibiting micropolar properties. First, a theoretically perfect cloak is obtained by designing the properties of an (unphysical) restricted micropolar material within the surrounding medium. Secondly, we investigate the performance of the cloak under more feasible design criteria, relating to finite elastic parameters. In particular, the behavior of a physically realizable cloak built up by unrestricted micropolar elastic media is investigated. Numerical studies are conducted for the case of buried as well as surface breaking structures in 2 D subjected to incident Rayleigh waves pertinent to seismic loading. The studies show how the developed cloaking procedure can be utilized to substantially reduce the response of the structure. In particular, the results indicate the performance of the cloak in relation to constraints on the elastic parameters...|$|R
40|$|Commonly, {{vibration}} isolation systems reduce the transmissibility from seismic base vibrations to <b>sensitive</b> <b>structures.</b> To obtain a desirable low isolation frequency, {{vibration isolation}} systems are typically equipped with low stiffness interfaces between the involved structures. Strongly detrimental influences to the possible vibration reduction performance {{are caused by}} the effects of additional force disturbances that act directly on the isolated object. To protect <b>sensitive</b> <b>structures</b> from vibrations, isolation systems need to generate high flexibility against the vibrating ground. In the same time those systems need to generate high stiffness against the direct (force) disturbances as well. The technique described in this paper enables vibration reduction at such a sensitive object while seismic base and direct force disturbances are concurrently present. It is theoretically introduced and experimentally examined how the emerging conflict of simultaneous vibration isolation and energy reflection can be solved at a single isolation interface. This paper shows that even soft, adaptively altered isolation interfaces can reach these contrary goals. These interfaces are equipped with piezoelectric foil actuators to enable active control. The used active control mechanism and the very promising experimental results are highlighted in this paper...|$|R
