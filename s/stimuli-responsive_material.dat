40|$|This work {{describes}} the fabrication, characterization, and modelling of liquid crystalline polymer network films with a multiple patterned 3 D nematic director profile, a <b>stimuli-responsive</b> <b>material</b> that exhibits complex mechanical actuation under change of temperature or pH. These films have a discrete alternating striped or checkerboard director {{profile in the}} plane, and a 90 -degree twist through {{the depth of the}} film. When actuated via heating, the striped films deform into accordion-like folds, while the film patterned with a checkerboard microstructure buckles out-of-plane. Furthermore, striped films are fabricated so that they also deform into an accordion shaped fold, by a change of pH in an aqueous environment. Three-dimensional finite element simulations and elasticity analysis provide insight into the dependence of shape evolution on director microstructure and the sample's aspect ratio.

40|$|A {{route to}} cheap and {{disposable}} sensors for the chemical sensing market, with potential applications including monitoring of food spoilage, is reported herein. The sensor {{is the result}} of the direct integration of a <b>stimuli-responsive</b> <b>material,</b> poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), with an electronic component. The printing and sintering of colloidal silver ink solutions onto PDMS was optimized to allow the printing of conductive silver feed loops, which are the active sensing component in antennas for passive (battery-free) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags. The response of these devices is related to the degree of swelling of the PDMS, which, in turn, has been shown to be correlated to the Hansen solubility parameters and the vapour pressures of the corresponding volatile organic compounds (VOCs). When exposed to solvent vapour the printed feed loop fractures, increasing resistance and ultimately breaking conductivity, leading to a change in the transmitted power and read range of the wireless device. Remarkably upon removal from the vapour, the fractured feed loops reassemble and become conductive again, making them switchable and “multi-use”.

These environmental conditions include factors, such as pH, temperature and enzymes that are specific to a type of cell, tissue or organ or a pathological state, such as inflammation, cancer or infection. These conditions can act as specific triggers or stimuli for the efficient release of therapeutics at their destination by overcoming many physiological and biological barriers.

To make a selection of these materials, a designer will consider first of all the main functionality of these materials, which is their transition phenomenon, as it gives them a capacity to process information. To get a perspective on stimuli-responsive materials and the possibilities they offer, the first step has been to class them according to their transition phenomenon. This has been done {{in the form of a}} graph where transition phenomena are represented as a link between their associated input and output. A second representation has been made starting from the first graph, but adding a link to the user of a product which use a <b>stimuli-responsive</b> <b>material.</b> To do so, the inputs of the materials has been differentiated by the fact that they can be activated by the user, the environment or by an intermediary system; the outputs has been linked to the achievable behaviors of a product and with the sensory modality the user will engage to notice these behaviors. After having proposed this classification of stimuli-responsive materials, the next step of the work is to get more detailed information about their behavior, and to organize and represent this information in a coherent and efficient way. To do so, we proposed a description for each type of transition phenomenon, which shows its most important characteristics in a visual way. This information is now being summed up in a database, which is organized with different tables and tree-structures that will describe stimuli-responsive materials, transition phenomena and the link between them.

A subclass of this family is comprised of stimuli-responsive hydrogels that are three-dimensional, hydrophilic, polymer networks capable of large water intake. These characteristics make them a potential candidate for the fabrication of biocompatible systems, which can be used for tailored drug delivery and regenerative medicine within the body. Incorporation of responsive units in such polymeric networks allows for their use as micro-machines capable of doing mechanical work in response to the chosen stimulus. The application of smart materials offers tangible solutions in the field of actuators for microfluidic valves, artificial muscles and biomimetic robots [2 - 5].

40|$|Smart <b>stimuli-responsive</b> <b>materials</b> {{that can}} be {{externally}} triggered to undergo mechanical motions have a huge potential in applications ranging from artificial muscles and sensing to microrobotics. Among different classes of <b>stimuli-responsive</b> <b>materials,</b> photomechanical actuators based on liquid-crystal elastomers (LCEs) are of particular importance because they provide a route to control mechanical motions with light. Liquid-crystal elastomers exhibit a unique combination of anisotropic molecular order due to liquid crystallinity, and elasticity {{brought about by the}} polymer network. This coupling leads to the ability of free-standing LCE samples to change their shape reversibly after the application of external stimulus. Plasmonic nanoparticles, for example gold nano-rods, have the ability to absorb light strongly at different wavelengths, depending on their dimensions, which makes them a possible candidate to produce the light response needed to actuate LCEs. In the Thesis work three photoactuable liquid-crystal elastomers, which absorb light in different wavelengths, were studied. Infrared-absorbing gold nanorods, cross-linked UV-absorbing azobenzenes, and doped visible-absorbing azobenzenes, were used as light-absorbing moieties. The LCE that was used was acrylate-based and the sample films were prepared by applying well-developed liquid crystal-alignment technologies and photopolymerization. As a major part of this work, gold nanorods were synthesized and functionalized. Gold nanorods were synthesized with a seed-mediated growth method in water by using hexadecylcetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a surfactant and 5 -bromosalisylic acid as an additive. Rods were also synthesized without the additive for comparison and it was found that nanorods synthesized with the additive had smaller size dispersion and better morphology. Gold nanorods were successfully functionalized and transferred to organic solutions with dodecanethiol when thiolated polyethylene glycol was used for pre-functionalization. The solubility of the functionalized gold nanorods into LCE mixture (comprising photopolymerizable monomer and cross-linker) was studied. However, functionalized gold nanorods were not soluble into the LCE matrix, whereas the two dyes showed a good solubility and polymerized films could be efficiently actuated with light.

Herein we present several approaches for introducing fluid movement and sensing using <b>stimuli-responsive</b> <b>materials.</b> The first approach comprises the use of adaptive nanostructured coatings for direct sensing of flow in continuous flow mode. For this, the inner walls of micro-capillaries and micro-channels were coated with polymeric materials {{that can be used}} to detect a variety of target species. Two types of adaptive coatings will be discussed. The first one is based on the conductive polymer polyaniline (PAni) [1, 2] while the second consists of polymeric brushes based on spiropyran [3, 4]. Using the “grafting” approach homogeneous coatings were obtained on the micro-channel/micro-capillary surface that retained their inherent nano-morphology. The optical proprieties of these coatings change in response to a variety of target analytical species (divalent metal ions, solvents of different polarities, ammonia, H+) passing through the microfluidic device in continuous flow mode. The grafting approach can provide nanostructured to microstructured coatings that combine small diffusion paths with relatively thick optical path lengths, thereby providing sensitive and fast optical responses to the target analytes. The second approach comprises the use of porous photo-actuated hydrogels as photo-controlled micro-valves in microfluidic systems for repeatable ON/OFF flow modulation in flowing streams over a wide range of pH values (acidic to ca. pH 7. 0). Incorporation of such stimuli-controlled structures in microfluidic devices offers unprecedented versatility and external flow control.
