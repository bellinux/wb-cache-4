60|$|Captain Nibletts {{raised his}} weather-beaten countenance and <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> with relish.|$|E
60|$|Saxon <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> carefully, {{and knew}} the old woman had been {{drinking}} again.|$|E
60|$|Gerald, on {{the brink}} of discussion, <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> with delight and {{prepared}} for action.|$|E
60|$|Old Granny Fox muttered {{this over}} and over, as she kept walking around uneasily and <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah,' said Gerald, <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> in elation, 'this is perfect. There's our sledge. We'll walk a bit--we'll {{run up the}} road.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{you smell}} this little marsh?' he said, <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> He was very {{sensitive}} to scents, and quick in understanding them.|$|R
60|$|The bear {{advanced}} {{to the center of}} the gully and looked up and down suspiciously. Then he <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{was sitting}} on a log; he <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and kept glancing uneasily round the wood. When Jemima alighted he quite jumped.|$|E
60|$|He strolled on; and Violet, having <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> for a {{few more}} minutes with her tip-tilted nose, went indoors to attend to her work.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] said Codd, {{as the dog}} rose, and, after <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> gently wagged {{his tail}} and trotted forward. [...] "Where’ she off to now?" ...|$|R
60|$|They {{could hear}} <b>the</b> excisemen <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> like hounds as they paced slowly along. When {{they reached the}} spot where the tub had burst, both stopped on the instant.|$|R
60|$|The animals did {{not become}} {{suspicious}} until they were {{less than a hundred}} yards away. Then, of a sudden, the leader threw up his head and began to <b>sniff</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
60|$|Head {{turned to}} the side and up, eyes closed, {{nostrils}} distended and quivering, he rose suddenly to his feet and <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Corliss looked up wonderingly.|$|E
60|$|Occasionally some flame {{would come}} in pursuit of her errant swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door, and {{immediately}} she <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{road was}} now {{enclosed}} {{on each side}} by a fence, and presently, as Whistling Dick drew nearer the house, he suddenly stopped and <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
60|$|Fully {{five minutes}} passed, {{and then the}} bear {{stretched}} himself and commenced to <b>sniff</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Then, of a sudden, he arose on his hind legs {{to get a better}} look at his surroundings.|$|R
6000|$|He {{went out}} with his head up and his hat cocked joyously, <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> of Piccadilly like a young hound loosed into covert. Jolly good biz! After that mouldy old slow hole down there! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So would I," [...] said Cecile Letellier, <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> like a war-horse {{that smells}} the battle; [...] "I warrant you I would not turn {{back from the}} field though all England were in front of me." ...|$|R
60|$|Another {{instant and}} it would have been too late. But just as the buck's head was turned and he <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> suspiciously, the young ranchman pulled the trigger.|$|E
60|$|He {{could see}} the wall of wood {{directly}} beneath him, and hear the low growling of the dogs as they <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> to discover {{the cause of the}} sounds which had aroused their suspicions.|$|E
60|$|They {{went on in}} silence. As {{they drew}} near a farm they saw the men {{unloading}} a last wagon of hay on to a very brown stack. He <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Though he was angry, he spoke.|$|E
5000|$|The 1950 {{short story}} [...] "The Man with English" [...] by H. L. Gold has {{a patient with}} senses {{reversed}} (hot feels cold, smooth feels rough, etc.) undergo corrective surgery. Coming out of anesthesia, <b>the</b> patient <b>sniffs</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> and asks [...] "What smells purple?" ...|$|R
500|$|Hearing is {{sensitive}} and eyesight is strong—the serow {{is able to}} detect and react to movement from a distance, and it can see well in low lighting. [...] Sense of smell is also strong, and the serow can be observed raising its head and <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> around it.|$|R
60|$|At {{either side}} of the leper stood his sole and {{constant}} companions, <b>the</b> two hyenas, <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Presently one of them uttered a low growl and with flattened head started, sneaking and wary, toward the jungle. The other followed. Bukawai, his curiosity aroused, trailed after them, in his hand a heavy knob-stick.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked to}} see that all the contemplation had {{departed}} from his attitude, now as alert {{as that of a}} fox-terrier which imagines he has seen a rat. His vast ears were cocked, his huge bulk trembled, his enormous trunk <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then {{the wolves}} plunged silently {{into the great}} kloof, but Galazi and Umslopogaas drew {{to the foot of}} it and waited. Presently there came a sound of {{breaking}} boughs, and lo! before them stood a buffalo, a bull who lowed fiercely and <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
60|$|Snap {{wanted to}} know what animal he was to fire at, but got no chance to ask, for just then one of the deer raised its head and <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> suspiciously. Then the two large ones began to run with the doe at their heels.|$|E
60|$|At {{the water}} tank I wetted my handkerchief, {{slapping}} it smartly {{across his forehead}} and face several times. In a moment I was rewarded by the raising of his lids. For a time he lay wide-eyed and quite uncomprehending. Then his scattered wits slowly foregathered, and he sat up <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> {{with an expression of}} wonderment upon his face.|$|R
60|$|With this {{he opened}} a back door that let in a flood of sunshine, and Santa Claus <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> fresh <b>air</b> gratefully.|$|R
50|$|Armadillos use {{olfaction}} {{as their}} main perception for foraging. The nine-banded armadillos {{are capable of}} smelling food as much as 20 cm below the ground surface. Once a food item is detected, it digs a small hole using its forefeet. Armadillos are also known to stand on their hind legs using their tail to brace themselves and <b>sniff</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> to either locate food or orient themselves.|$|R
60|$|All at {{once the}} dog {{put an end to}} Venters's pondering. Ring <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> turned slowly in his tracks with a whine, and then growled. Venters wheeled. Two {{horsemen}} were within a hundred yards, coming straight at him. One, lagging behind the other, was Oldring's Masked Rider.|$|E
60|$|He {{was on a}} ridge {{overlooking}} a small town. It was high noon. The air was crisp and bright. A few automobiles moved along a road. Off in the distance were some level fields. Conger {{went to the door}} and stepped outside. He <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Then he went back into the cage.|$|E
6000|$|Kate, however, to Mrs. Hale's indignation, {{threw her}} pretty {{head back and}} <b>sniffed</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> contemptuously. [...] "I really don't see {{anything}} but some absurd sentimentalism of their own, or some mannish wickedness they're concocting by themselves. I am by no means certain, Josephine, that Lee's influence over that young man {{is the best thing}} for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told her}} 'twas {{not to be}} thought of, and then what does <b>the</b> dame but <b>sniff</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and protest that I had better take heed, for {{there may not be}} so many who would choose a spoilt, misruled maid like mine. There's the work of yonder Sarum woman. I tell thee, Tib, never was bull in the ring more baited than am I." ...|$|R
50|$|Matakerepō, {{aware that}} someone is deceiving her, begins to <b>sniff</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> and her stomach distends, ready to swallow <b>the</b> stranger. She <b>sniffs</b> towards <b>the</b> south, and towards all the winds. When she <b>sniffs</b> towards <b>the</b> west she catches Tāwhaki's scent and calls out 'Are you come with the wind that blows on my skin?' Tāwhaki grunts, and Matakerepō says, 'Oh, it is my {{grandson}} Tāwhaki.' Her stomach begins to shrink. Had he not been from the west wind, she would have swallowed him.|$|R
60|$|When Whopper got outside again, {{followed}} by Shep, {{he saw the}} wolves had approached still closer. There were now seven of them, and they stood in a semi-circle, <b>sniffing</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> suspiciously. <b>The</b> man-smell was strong, and this they did not like, for to them it betokened only danger. Yet mingled with the man-smell {{was the smell of}} chicken and rabbit meat, and this pleased them, for they were hungry.|$|R
