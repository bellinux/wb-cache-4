40|$|This paper proposes an {{improved}} cellular automaton traffic flow model {{based on the}} brake light model, which takes into account that the desired time gap <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> is remarkably larger than one second. Although the hypothetical steady <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the deterministic limit corresponds to a unique relationship between speeds and gaps in the proposed model, the traffic <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> dynamically span a two-dimensional region in the plane of speed versus gap, due to the various randomizations. It is shown that the model is able to well reproduce (i) the free flow, synchronized flow, jam {{as well as the}} transitions among the three phases; (ii) the evolution features of disturbances and the spatiotemporal patterns in a car-following platoon; (iii) the empirical time series of traffic speed obtained from NGSIM data. Therefore, we argue that a model can potentially reproduce the empirical and experimental features of traffic flow, provided that the traffic states are able to dynamically span a 2 D speed-gap region...|$|R

This effort seeks to integrate detection, diagnostic, and prognostic capabilities with a hierarchical diagnostic reasoning architecture into a single synergistic, embeddable commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) unit. Three avenues have been pursued to advance the capabilities of health reasoning in support of IVHM. First, the scope of the systems/subsystems being monitored by the underlying Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) has been expanded. The HUMS is comprised of subsystem specific prognostic and health management (PHM) modules developed to process raw measured data and supply condition indicators (CI) targeting several flight critical areas from advanced aerospace applications: such as electro-mechanical actuators (EMA), engine performance, power train vibration, and structural impact detection and isolation.

40|$|When {{vehicles}} are driven on consecutive speed control humps, {{the parameters of}} speed control humps such as height, width, and space and vehicle’s speed are the important factors to affect safety and comfort of passengers. The paper assumes that the excitation function of the consecutive speed control humps is a half-sine wave and a SCHs-speed coupling excitation model called 7 -DOF nonlinear full-vehicle model and differential equation are established by introducing the time delay of incentive input and then by using numerical simulation to analyze chaotic vibration in 7 -DOF nonlinear full-vehicle model excited by consecutive speed control humps. The numerical simulation results show that chaotic vibration phenomenon possibly appears as {{vehicles are}} driven on consecutive speed control humps. Further studies indicate that the influence of nonlinear running <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> on driving comfort becomes manifest as the state changes from chaotic motions to the periodic motion of the high speed and the periodic motion of the low speed, and this phenomenon can be avoided by changing the parameters of consecutive speed control humps.

40|$|Abstract—Depending on driver {{intention}} and current motion <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle,</b> an infinite set of possible future trajectories exists. In this paper {{we present a}} stochastic filter which is able to select a representative set of reasonable trajectories from this solution set using additional information from a digital map. This is achieved by representing the map’s traffic lanes by their corresponding centerlines. Each detected vehicle is projected on these centerlines, where the necessary information is modeled as a multivariate random variable. With this stochastic model of traffic lanes and the stochastic vector of vehicle detection we define a new stochastic residual vector, which is used both in the lane assignment and during the generation of the motion predictions. For each traffic lane, which is assigned as relevant for a detected vehicle, we generate a new motion hypothesis by using an Extended Kalman Filter. To assess the plausibility of each motion hypothesis we employ an adaptive multivariate MCUSUM algorithm. The implemented stochastic filter is tested by evaluating real data from the Ko-FAS Research Initiative. While traditional motion prediction based on previous and current motion states of a vehicle only provide plausible prediction for a short term time horizon, we show that our approach achieves a reasonable motion hypothesis for long prediction intervals especially in complex scenarios as road intersections...|$|E
40|$|The {{so-called}} car “black boxes ” – ADR recorders {{have been}} available on automotive markets for many years. The task of those devices is to record information on car motion, driver’s behaviour, <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> systems and neighbouring environment. The records are to allow for accident reconstruction. In general, the devices being proposed are a simplified version of devices that have been applied e. g. in aviation for a long time. The problem is how those simplifications may affect the accuracy of reconstructions being performed. The simulation method {{of this type of}} research has been presented in this paper. A proceeding diagram, mathematical models of car motion applied in the method, records of ADR devices, an algorithm for processing quantities, recorded in ADR, in order to obtain reconstructed velocities histories and trajectories of car motion have been illustrated. A special attention was paid to a mathematical description of readings of acceleration sensors of ADR devices. An example of the experimental method verification has been presented. Then, three computational examples have been presented that focused on evaluation of influence of a number of quantities, being recorded in the ADR device, describing vehicle motion.

40|$|As the {{development}} of standards for the aeronautical mobile airport communications system (AeroMACS) progresses, the process of identifying and quantifying appropriate uses for the system is progressing. In addition to defining important elements of AeroMACS standards, indentifying the systems uses impacts AeroMACS bandwidth requirements. Although an initial 59 MHz spectrum allocation for AeroMACS was established in 2007, the allocation may be inadequate; {{studies have indicated that}} 100 MHz or more of spectrum may be required to support airport surface communications. Hence additional spectrum allocations have been proposed. Vehicle health management (VHM) systems, which can produce large volumes of vehicle health data, were not considered in the original bandwidth requirements analyses, and are therefore of interest in supporting proposals for additional AeroMACS spectrum. VHM systems are an emerging development in air vehicle safety, and preliminary estimates of the amount of data that will be produced and transmitted off an aircraft, both in flight and on the ground, have been prepared based on estimates of data produced by on-board vehicle health sensors and initial concepts of data processing approaches. This allowed an initial estimate of VHM data transmission requirements for the airport surface. More recently, vehicle-level systems designed to process and analyze VHM data and draw conclusions on the current <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> health have been undergoing testing and evaluation. These systems make use of vehicle system data that is mostly different from VHM data considered previously for airport surface transmission, and produce processed system outputs that will be also need to be archived, thus generating additional data load for AeroMACS. This paper provides an analysis of airport surface data transmission requirements resulting from the vehicle level reasoning systems, within the context of overall VHM data requirements...|$|E

40|$|Congestion is a {{major problem}} for the major cities of today. It reduces mobility, slows {{economic}} growth, and {{is a major}} cause of emissions. Vehicles traveling at slow speeds emit significantly more pollutants than vehicles traveling at free flow speeds. It is therefore important {{to determine the extent of}} congestion in a city, and its impact on the environment. This thesis focuses on congestion in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area. Mexico City is one of the largest cities in the world, and faces severe levels of congestion and emissions. Although much of the transportation trips are made by high capacity modes such as buses and colectivo microbuses, a growing population and increasing automobile ownership rate will further exacerbate the city's mobility and environment. In order to measure the level of congestion in Mexico City, a network model was built. Combining data from a 1994 origin destination survey and the 2000 census with a digitized roadway network, we were able to determine the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> speeds on roadways throughout the city. This speed distribution was then used in the MOBILE 6 model to estimate the total emissions from road based transportation sources. The network model was also used to study the extent of congestion and emissions for various future infrastructure projects. An analysis was done for a year 2025 growth scenario, where Mexico City continues to grow in population and size. The impact of two infrastructure improvements on congestion was also studied. The results of the model show that while it is a useful tool for studying congestion on a citywide scale, the effects of local infrastructure changes cannot be accurately modeled. Further work on improving the model may yield improved results on a greater level of detail. by Yasuaki Daniel Amano. Thesis (S.

30|$|There are two {{different}} approaches from previous research studies that developed the collision avoidance at an intersection: with and without communication. Without communication, the stand-alone autonomous vehicle is equipped with several sensors to measure its state, e.g., GPS, position, orientation, and velocity, which is now in general use. Also used, an environment sensor to measure the vehicle’s surrounding, e.g., the laser range finder, radar, and camera, were used to locate the static and dynamic obstacles around a vehicle and then plan a collision free path by using the stop and go technique [8, 9]. With communication, [10] presented the latest wireless communication standard for vehicle communication. The IEEE 802.11 p with the spectrum of 5.9 -GHz band, dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) is the standard that was developed for use only with vehicle communication. The time scheduling method by means of intelligent agents was introduced in [11]. It determined the arrival time of a vehicle and the time that a vehicle would stay at an intersection by sharing the state information and then passing {{it back to the}} following vehicle by using mobile ad hoc networks. Hafner et al. [12] presented the automated collision avoidance at an intersection between two vehicles, using vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V 2 V). It used V 2 V to share the state information of two vehicles to find the potential collision area and then control the longitudinal velocities of both vehicles to prevent them from reaching the collision area at the same time. Similarly, [13] proposed the method of sharing the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> inertia to create the navigation function that creates a safe and smooth path without fully stopping at the intersection. Sheng et al. [14] propose the method of intersection collision groups: each vehicle broadcasts its collision situation based on the path selection. When a vehicle reaches the communication range, the collision free path was determined by comparing the initial member of collision group and of another incoming vehicle. The driving speed was cooperatively calculated for the safe crossing of the intersection. The proposed concept in [15] consists of intersection geometry, to map the collision region by using the first-come first-serve (FCFS) principle to manage a vehicle crossing an intersection. Another method is using vehicle-to-infrastructure communication (V 2 I). Bruns and Trächtler [16] and Bruns [17] used the concept of network flow to model the intersection. The intersection was separated into small equal connected sections. The incoming vehicle has to reserve nodes based on the selected route, and the safe trajectory is determined by using dynamic programming. This resulted in the centralized control principle. Moreover, the extended study in [18] was considering optimization of multiple objectives to improve driving efficiency. The fuel consumption and duration of a journey were minimized by using the technique of dynamic programming.|$|E
