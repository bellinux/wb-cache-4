5|$|Passive smoking—the {{inhalation}} {{of smoke}} from another's smoking—is {{a cause of}} lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive <b>smoker</b> {{can be defined as}} someone living or working with a <b>smoker.</b> Studies from the US, Europe and the UK have consistently shown a significantly increased risk among those exposed to passive smoke. Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk while those who work in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase in risk. Investigations of sidestream smoke suggest it is more dangerous than direct smoke. Passive smoking causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer each year in the USA.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To: {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} smoking status on objective productivity and absenteeism measures; {{evaluate the}} impact of smoking status on subjective measures of productivity; and assess the correlation between subjective and objective productivity measures.  DESIGN—Prospective cohort study in a workplace environment.  SUBJECTS—Approximately 300  employees (100  each of former, current, and never <b>smokers)</b> at a reservation office of a large US airline.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Objective productivity and absenteeism data were supplied by the employer. Subjective assessments of productivity were collected using a self report instrument, the Health and Work Questionnaire (HWQ).  RESULTS—Current <b>smokers</b> had significantly greater absenteeism than did never <b>smokers,</b> with former <b>smokers</b> having intermediate values; among former <b>smokers,</b> absenteeism showed a significant decline with years following cessation. Former <b>smokers</b> showed an increase in seven of 10  objective productivity measures as compared to current <b>smokers,</b> with a mean increase of 4. 5 %. While objective productivity measures for former <b>smokers</b> decreased compared to measures for current <b>smokers</b> {{during the first year}} following cessation, values for former <b>smokers</b> were greater than those for current <b>smokers</b> by 1 - 4 years following cessation. Subjective assessments of "productivity evaluation by others" and "personal life satisfaction" showed significant trends with highest values for never <b>smokers,</b> lowest for current <b>smokers,</b> and intermediate for former <b>smokers.</b>  CONCLUSIONS—Workplace productivity is increased and absenteeism is decreased among former <b>smokers</b> as compared to current <b>smokers.</b> Productivity among former <b>smokers</b> increases over time toward values seen among never <b>smokers.</b> Subjective measures of productivity provide indications of novel ways of productivity assessment that are sensitive to smoking status.    Keywords: smoking cessation; workplace; absenteeism; productivity; questionnaire...|$|R

Lipid profile, plasma fibrinogen and platelet count were analyzed by standard methods. Our results showed mean platelet count for <b>smokers</b> is 2, 86, 345 per mm 3 and for non-smokers 2, 04, 484. 6 per mm 3. The mean plasma fibrinogen concentration for <b>smokers</b> is 3. 48 gm/dl and for non <b>smokers</b> is 3. 12 gm/dl. The platelet count and plasma fibrinogen concentration shows a higher value for <b>smokers</b> when compared to non- <b>smokers.</b> This is statistically significant. The mean total cholesterol level for <b>smokers</b> (186 ± 30. 10) mg/dl and non <b>smokers</b> (166. 3 ± 24. 26) mg/dl and the mean triglyceride level for <b>smokers</b> (175 ± 59. 43) mg/dl and non <b>smokers</b> (132. 09 ±+ 33. 80) mg/dl are also statistically significant.

40|$|Background:We {{hypothesize that}} among {{patients}} with lung cancers the KRAS/EGFR mutation profile and overall survival of collegiate <b>smokers</b> (former <b>smokers</b> who smoked between 101 lifetime cigarettes and 5 pack-years) are distinct {{from those of}} never <b>smokers</b> and former <b>smokers</b> with 15 pack-years or more. Methods:We collected age, sex, stage, survival, and smoking history for patients evaluated from 2004 to 2009 with advanced stage lung cancers and known KRAS/EGFR status. Mutation profile and overall survival were compared using Fisher’s exact test and log-rank test, respectively. Results:Data were available for 852 patients with advanced-stage lung cancers with known KRAS/EGFR status, of which 6 % were collegiate <b>smokers,</b> 36 % were never <b>smokers,</b> and 30 % were former <b>smokers</b> with 15 pack-years or more. The mutation profile of collegiate <b>smokers</b> (15 % KRAS mutations, 27 % EGFR mutations) was distinct from those of never <b>smokers</b> (p < 0. 001) and former <b>smokers</b> with 15 pack-years or more (p < 0. 001) and {{not significantly different from}} those of former <b>smokers</b> with 5 to 15 pack-years (p = 0. 9).

40|$|BACKGROUD: This study {{sought to}} provide an {{epidemiological}} profile of non-daily (ND) <b>smokers</b> in South Africa. METHODS: Using data obtained from the 1998 South African demographic and health survey (SADHS) - the largest nationally representative dataset available - <b>smokers</b> were classified as non-daily (ND) <b>smokers</b> or daily <b>smokers.</b> NDS were defined as persons aged 18 and over who had ever smoked 100 cigarettes, but did not currently smoke daily. RESULTS: In 1998, an estimated 10 % of current <b>smokers</b> were ND <b>smokers</b> (n = 255). Of the ND <b>smokers,</b> 69. 7 % had smoked daily {{in the past and}} currently smoked significantly fewer cigarettes per day (CPD) than current daily <b>smokers</b> (5. 4 vs. 9. 8).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{differences in}} snuff consumption, socio-demographic and psychosocial characteristics between baseline daily <b>smokers</b> who had remained daily <b>smokers,</b> become intermittent <b>smokers</b> or stopped smoking at the 1 -year follow-up. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS: A population of 12 507 individuals aged 45 - 69 years, interviewed at baseline in 1992 - 94 {{and at a}} 1 -year follow-up, was investigated in this longitudinal study. The three groups of baseline daily <b>smokers</b> were compared to the total population according to socio-demographic, psychosocial and snuff consumption characteristics. A multivariate logistic regression model {{was used to assess}} differences in psychosocial conditions, adjusting for age, sex, country of origin, marital status, education and snuff consumption. FINDINGS: Eighty-six per cent of all baseline daily <b>smokers</b> remained daily <b>smokers,</b> 6. 5 % had become intermittent <b>smokers</b> and 7. 3 % had stopped smoking at the 1 -year follow-up. The daily <b>smokers</b> who remained daily <b>smokers</b> {{were more likely to be}} born in other countries than Sweden, not married, have a lower educational level and poorer psychosocial conditions than the total population, while the socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial resources of those daily <b>smokers</b> who had become intermittent <b>smokers</b> or had stopped smoking were much more similar to the general population, with the exception of a higher snuff consumption, especially for intermittent <b>smokers.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Daily <b>smokers</b> who remained daily <b>smokers</b> at the 1 -year follow-up had poorer psychosocial assets, especially social participation, than baseline daily <b>smokers</b> who had become intermittent <b>smokers</b> or had stopped smoking, and the general population. The results suggest that low levels of social participation are a potent barrier against smoking cessation. Snuff consumption may explain a part of the increase in smoking cessation among men as opposed to women in Sweden...|$|R
