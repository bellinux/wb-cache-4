40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a version of}} the Bayesian bootstrap that assigns random Dirichlet mass uniformly across <b>statistically</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>blocks.</b> The method requires prior knowl-edge that the underlying distribution is continuous with known compact support. Under these conditions, the resulting analysis has three advantages over traditional bootstrap competitors. First, it takes account of the probability integral transformation. Secondly, it often enables exact expressions for the bootstrap distributions of common statistical functionals; thus small sample properties are known precisely, in contrast to the usual bootstrap situation. Thirdly, it shows consistent superiority in large-scale simulation experiments that compare the global accuracy of confidence intervals for the mean, median, variance and distribution function. The simulation experiments use a goodness-of-fit test as the basis for comparing the performance of competing bootstrap techniques...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedThis work {{presents}} contributions on {{two important}} aspects of the role of signal representation in statistical learning problems, in the context of deriving new methodologies and representations for speech recognition and the estimation of information theoretic quantities.; The first topic focuses on the problem of optimal filter bank selection using Wavelet Packets (WPs) for speech recognition applications. We propose new results to show an estimation-approximation error tradeoff across sequence of embedded representations. These results were used to formulate the minimum probability of error signal representation (MPE-SR) problem as a complexity regularization criterion. Restricting this criterion to the filter bank selection, algorithmic solutions are provided by exploring the dyadic tree-structure of WPs. These solutions are stipulated in terms of a set of conditional independent assumptions for the acoustic observation process, in particular, a Markov tree property across the indexed structure of WPs. In the technical side, this work presents contributions on the extension of minimum cost tree pruning algorithms and their properties to affine tree functionals. For the experimental validation, a phone classification task ratifies the goodness of Wavelet Packets as an analysis scheme for non-stationary time-series processes, and the effectiveness of the MPE-SR to provide cost effective discriminative filter bank solution for pattern recognition.; The second topic addresses the problem of data-dependent partitions for the estimation of mutual information and Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). This work proposes general histogram-based estimates considering non-product data-driven partition schemes. The main contribution is the stipulation of sufficient conditions to make these histogram-based constructions strongly consistent for both problems. The sufficient conditions consider combinatorial complexity indicator for partition families and the use of large deviation type of inequalities (Vapnik-Chervonenkis inequalities). On the application side, two emblematic data-dependent constructions are derived from this result, one based on <b>statistically</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>blocks</b> and the other, on a tree-structured vector quantization scheme. A range of design values was stipulated to guarantee strongly consistency estimates for both framework. Furthermore, experimental results under controlled settings demonstrate the superiority of these data-driven techniques in terms of a bias-variance analysis when compared to conventional product histogram-based and kernel plug-in estimates...|$|R

This study {{sought to}} {{establish}} the discriminant validity of a rapid cognitive screen, that is, the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network (NINDS-CSN) 5 -minute protocol, and compare its discriminant validity to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) in detecting cognitive impairment (CI) in PD patients. Methods. One hundred and one PD patients were recruited from a movement disorders clinic in Singapore and they received the NINDS-CSN 5 -minute protocol, MoCA, and MMSE. No cognitive impairment (NCI) was defined as Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) = 0 and CI was defined as CDR ≥ 0. 5. Results. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of NINDS-CSN 5 -minute protocol was <b>statistically</b> <b>equivalent</b> to MoCA and larger than MMSE (0. 86 versus 0. 90, P= 0. 07; 0. 86 versus 0. 76, P= 0. 03).

Furthermore, a random spatial shift can be included, representing patient repositioning. To evaluate the tool, simulated images were compared with real scan data of the NEMA NU 2 image quality phantom. The scan was acquired as a 60 -min list-mode scan and reconstructed with and without TOF and/or RM. For every reconstruction setting, ten <b>statistically</b> <b>equivalent</b> images, representing 30, 60, 120 and 300  s scan duration, were generated.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{representative}} {{volume element}} (RVE) of a material microstruc-ture {{plays an important}} role in the analysis of heterogeneous materials, such as composites. Effective material properties in a composite material depend on the microstructural concentration and dispersion of different phases in the RVE. In this study, a combination of statistical and computational tools are proposed for identifying the <b>statistically</b> <b>equivalent</b> RVE (SERVE) for an elastic composite with nonuniform dispersion of inclusions. Numerical tests are conducted with various statistical functions of geometry, stresses, and strains to examine the validity of potential alternative definitions of the SERVE. In the first of this two-part article, methods are addressed for undamaged composite microstructures with continuous interfaces between the fiber and the matrix. The sequel article deals with the evolution of SERVE caused by damage due to interfacial debonding.

Minor civil divisions are the primary subcounty governmental or administrative units; they have legal boundaries and names as well as governmental functions or administrative purposes specified by State law. The most familiar types of MCDs are towns and townships, but there are many others (see Table 8 - 1). In some situations, the Census Bureau must complete the coverage of subcounty units by creating additional entities called unorganized territories (UTs) that it treats as being <b>statistically</b> <b>equivalent</b> to MCDs.

40|$|In this paper, {{we show an}} {{experimental}} study {{on a set of}} evolutionary fuzzy classifiers (EFCs) purposely designed to manage imbalanced datasets. Three of these EFCs represent the state-of-the-art of the main approaches to the evolutionary generation of fuzzy rule-based systems for imbalanced dataset classification. The fourth EFC is an extension of a multi-objective evolutionary learning (MOEL) scheme we have recently proposed for managing imbalanced datasets: the rule base and the membership function parameters of a set of FRBCs are concurrently learned by optimizing the sensitivity, the specificity and the complexity. By using non-parametric tests, we first compare the results obtained by the four EFCs in terms of area under the ROC curve. We show that our MOEL scheme outperforms two of the comparison algorithms and results to be <b>statistically</b> <b>equivalent</b> to the third. Further, the classifiers generated by our MOEL scheme are characterized by a lower number of rules than the ones generated by the other approaches. To validate the effectiveness of our MOEL scheme in dealing with imbalanced datasets, we also compare our results with the ones achieved, after rebalancing the datasets, by two state-of-the-art algorithms, namely FURIA and FARC-HD, proposed for generating fuzzy rule-based classifiers for balanced datasets. We show that our MOEL scheme is <b>statistically</b> <b>equivalent</b> to FURIA, which is associated with the highest accuracy rank in the statistical tests. However, the rule bases generated by FURIA are characterized by a low interpretability. Finally, we show that the results achieved by our MOEL scheme are <b>statistically</b> <b>equivalent</b> to the ones achieved by four state-of-the-art approaches, based on ensembles of non-fuzzy classifiers, appropriately designed for dealing with imbalanced dataset...|$|R
