40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} mitigating the negative effect of vortex motion inside the suction chambers of centrifugal pumps {{in order to obtain}} better use of water resource and decrease the risk related to loss of prime. It was studied the influence of a rotating device on the vortex motion {{in the case of a}} vertical suction pipe. The device is consisting of three thin vertical cylinders symmetrically mounted on a horizontal rotating disk placed in front of the inlet section of the suction pipe. The experimental research was conducted for various diameters of the cylinders, water levels in the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> and pump flow rates. It was assessed the vortex type, frequency of arising and living life of vortices. The experimental results are compared with the case the device is absent in order to assess the efficiency of the solution. By using the device a decrease of about 12  15 % of vortex arising is observed for most of the water levels in the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> and for 80 - 90 % of the centrifugal pump flow rates. If high flow rates and low water level in the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> are simultaneously present, violent vortex motion is blocking the rotating device and the volume of air entered the pipe is massive - extreme regime. The flow pattern in the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> was visualized using a laser sheet. At the inlet section of the suction pipe one can observe two main flow patterns: central vortex entrance for high water level in the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber</b> and reduce flow rates of the centrifugal pump and lateral vortex entrance for low water level and high flow rates. The conclusions of the experiment confirm the energy dissipation of the vortices arising in the <b>suction</b> <b>chamber,</b> due to utilization of the rotating device, in most of the centrifugal pump regimes...|$|E

40|$|The {{so-called}} stiction effect (or stiction force) {{is one of}} {{the sources}} of thermodynamic losses in compressor suction and discharge systems. The losses associated with the stiction effect are caused by a deformation of the lubricating oil film between the valve and the seat. This generates a delay in the valve opening, since larger pressure differencesbetween the cylinder and the discharge and/or <b>suction</b> <b>chambers</b> are needed to compensate for those effects. This paper advances a theoretical model for solving the dynamic behavior of a ring-shaped lubricant oil film between a discharge valve and the seat. The valve is allowed to move under the action of an external force due to the timedependent pressure difference between the cylinder and the discharge chamber. The main contributions of the model are the consideration of a finite amount of oil between the valve and the seat and mathematical relationships for calculating the initial condition for the oil film thickness. The model results are compared with those obtained with the Khalifa and Liu (1998) method. At conditions typical of discharge systems of domestic refrigeration compressors, viscous effects are the dominant component in the oil stiction force under dynamic conditions...|$|R

5000|$|A chest {{drainage}} system is typically {{used to collect}} chest drainage (air, blood, effusions). Most commonly, {{drainage system}}s use three chambers {{which are based on}} the three-bottle system. The first chamber allows fluid that is drained from the chest to be collected. The second chamber functions as a [...] "water seal", which acts as a one way valve allowing gas to escape, but not reenter the chest. Air bubbling through the water seal chamber is usual when the patient coughs or exhales but may indicate, if continual, a pleural or system leak that should be evaluated critically. It can also indicate a leak of air from the lung. The third <b>chamber</b> is the <b>suction</b> control <b>chamber.</b> The height of the water in this chamber regulates the negative pressure applied to the system. A gentle bubbling through the water column minimizes evaporation of the fluid and indicates that the suction is being regulated to the height of the water column. In this way, increased wall suction does not increase the negative pressure of the system. Newer drainage systems eliminate the water seal using a mechanical check-valve, and some also use a mechanical regulator to regulate the suction pressure. Systems which employ both these are dubbed [...] "dry" [...] systems, whereas systems that retain the water seal but use a mechanical regulator are called [...] "wet-dry" [...] systems. Systems which use a water seal and water column regulator are called [...] "wet" [...] systems. Dry systems are advantageous as tip-overs of wet systems can spill and mix with blood, mandating the replacement of the system. Even newer systems are smaller and more ambulatory so the patient can be sent home for drainage if indicated.|$|R

In this concept a sleeve (or cylinder) and a mechanical rotor are eccentrically mounted such that both touch each other circumferentially at one linear point of contact during a rotation. One vane (primary) has its rounded end embedded fairly loosely into the sleeve causing it to be rotated along with the vane {{and at the same time}} the vane reciprocates in a slot in the mechanical rotor. The other vanes (secondary) are free to slide out of their respective slots in the rotor, by centrifugal force and are similarly pushed in by the rotating sleeve. With this arrangement compression is guaranteed at all speeds. As soon as the rotor begins to rotate <b>suction</b> and compression <b>chambers</b> are respectively created by the primary vane, while the secondary vanes only start performing the compression function when enough centrifugal force has been built up. In addition, the relative rotation between the sleeve and each secondary vane reduces rubbing between the two. With this arrangement the study found out that the performance of the compressor is significantly improved compared to other similar existing refrigerant compressors of multi-vane rotary type. The reduction in friction is estimated to be about 45 %. Analysis of instantaneous internal leakage was also conducted and was found that this new compressor concept possesses a relatively high volumetric efficiency. The work is currently continued involving designing, fabricating and performance testing of the compressor...|$|R
