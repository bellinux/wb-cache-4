Quantifiers, which include one, many, some and all, are used to <b>specify</b> <b>the</b> noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree {{with the number of}} the determiner, e.g. one man (sg.) but all men (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.|$|E

5|$|Glamorgan {{sausages}} {{are thought}} to have been originally made with Glamorgan cheese which is no longer made due to the near-extinction of the Glamorgan cattle from which it was produced. They rose in popularity during the Second World War due to rationing limiting the volume of meat.

To move units, players can shift the mouse to select units on the main map, move to the unit menu to select an action, {{and then back to}} the main map or minimap to <b>specify</b> <b>the</b> target area; but shortcut keys can eliminate the middle mouse action in this cycle.|$|E

The sport's Laws of the Game <b>specify</b> <b>the</b> minimum kit which a player must use, and also prohibit the use of anything that is dangerous to either the player or another participant. Individual competitions may stipulate further restrictions, such as regulating the size of logos displayed on shirts and stating that, {{in the event of}} a match between teams with identical or similar colours, the away team must change to different coloured attire.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum dusts and fumes, {{generated}} by mining or metalworking, can be toxic, especially if ingested (including dust {{trapped in the}} sinuses and later swallowed). Low levels of prolonged exposure can cause irritation to the eyes and skin. Direct inhalation or ingestion of molybdenum and its oxides should be avoided. OSHA regulations <b>specify</b> <b>the</b> maximum permissible molybdenum exposure in an 8-hour day as 5mg/m3. Chronic exposure to 60 to 600mg/m3 can cause symptoms including fatigue, headaches and joint pains. At levels of 5000mg/m3, molybdenum is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E

It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription. Under the genetic code, these RNA strands are translated to <b>specify</b> <b>the</b> sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation.|$|E

While the design did not <b>specify</b> <b>the</b> exact form that this would take, in the completed memorial these names are inscribed in the bronzes that line the walls. The design also allowed for a cenotaph within the inner shrine, which the designers suggested could either be used as a symbolic representation of the unknown soldier or as the marker to an actual grave, although this aspect was never realised.|$|E
5|$|Permits are {{required}} for all overnight visits to the BWCAW. Quota permits {{are required}} for groups taking an overnight paddle, motor, or hiking trip, or a motorized day-use trip into the BWCAW from May 1 through September 30. These permits must be reserved in advance. Day use paddle and hiking permits do not require advance reservation and can be filled out at BWCAW entry points. From October 1 through April 30, permit reservations are not necessary, but a permit must be filled out at the permit stations located at each entry point. Each permit must <b>specify</b> <b>the</b> trip leader, the specific entry point and the day of entry. The permits are for an indefinite length, although visitors are only allowed one entry into the wilderness and cannot stay in one campsite for more than 14 nights.|$|E

The Democratically-controlled House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough that they could not wait until the regular session convened; they claimed that Fletcher was calling the session only to boost his sagging poll numbers before the upcoming election in which he faced a challenge from Democrat Steve Beshear. The House convened on the day appointed and adjourned an hour later without transacting any business.|$|E
