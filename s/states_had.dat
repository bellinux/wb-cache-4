5|$|By 1912, 239 {{political}} parties {{at both the}} state and national level had pledged some form of direct election, and 33 <b>states</b> <b>had</b> introduced the use of direct primaries. Twenty-seven <b>states</b> <b>had</b> called for a constitutional convention on the subject, with 31 states needed to reach the threshold; Arizona and New Mexico each achieved statehood that year (bringing the total number of states to 48), and were expected to support the motion. Alabama and Wyoming, already <b>states,</b> <b>had</b> passed resolutions in favor of a convention without formally calling for one.|$|E
5|$|Between 1788 and 1789, the Minister-Plenipotentiary of the Austrian Netherlands {{decided that}} the only way in which reform could be {{provoked}} would be by rapid and uncompromising enforcement. Some <b>states</b> <b>had</b> already begun to refuse payment of taxes to the Austrian authorities. The Joyous Entry was officially annulled and the Estates of Hainaut and Brabant were disbanded.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s, Kennan criticized U.S. {{involvement}} in Vietnam, {{arguing that the}} United <b>States</b> <b>had</b> little vital interest in the region. Kennan believed that the USSR, Britain, Germany, Japan, and North America remained the areas of vital U.S. interests. During the 1970s and 1980s, he was a major critic of the renewed arms race as détente was ended.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{asserted}} that the United States was {{given the opportunity to}} view the other nations' tenders and lower their price accordingly. Germany also alleged that the United <b>States</b> <b>had</b> secured the deal by pledging to come to Argentina's defense should they become embroiled in a military conflict.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, the New England Council elected Flanders president. The {{governors}} of the New England <b>states</b> <b>had</b> established this council to study industry and commerce in their states. Flanders’s role increased his {{awareness of the}} labor and business assets in New England. He also tried to alert his peers to the prospect of U.S. involvement in the expanding Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>states</b> <b>had</b> placed {{restrictions}} on fisher trapping by the 1930s, coincidental {{with the end}} of the logging boom. A combination of forest regrowth in abandoned farmlands and improved forest management practices increased available habitat and allowed remnant populations to recover. Populations have since recovered sufficiently that the species is no longer endangered. Increasing forest cover in eastern North America means that fisher populations will remain sufficiently robust for the near future. Between 1955 and 1985, some <b>states</b> <b>had</b> allowed limited trapping to resume. In areas where fishers were eliminated, porcupine populations subsequently increased. Areas with a high density of porcupines were found to have extensive damage to timber crops. In these cases, fishers were reintroduced by releasing adults relocated from other places into the forest. Once the fisher populations became reestablished, porcupine numbers returned to natural levels. In Washington State, fisher sightings were reported into the 1980s, but an extensive survey in the 1990s did not locate any.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1865, {{two days}} after the {{announcement}} that the <b>States</b> <b>had</b> ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, Wilson introduced a bill to protect the civil rights of African Americans. Although Wilson's bill failed to pass Congress it was effectively the same bill as the Civil Rights Act of 1866 that passed Congress over Johnson's veto on April 9, 1866.|$|E

5|$|The Court further {{determined}} that states {{could not be}} forced to participate in the Medicaid expansion. ACA withheld all Medicaid funding from states declining to participate in the expansion. The Court ruled that this withdrawal of funding was unconstitutionally coercive and that individual <b>states</b> <b>had</b> the right to opt out without losing preexisting Medicaid funding.|$|E
5|$|The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each {{representing}} a congressional district for a two-year term.

5|$|The Japanese Army and Navy {{had their}} own {{independent}} atomic-bomb programs and therefore the Japanese understood enough to know how very difficult building it would be. Therefore, many Japanese {{and in particular the}} military members of the government refused to believe the United <b>States</b> <b>had</b> built an atomic bomb, and the Japanese military ordered their own independent tests to determine the cause of Hiroshima's destruction. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, argued that even if the United <b>States</b> <b>had</b> made one, they could not have many more. American strategists, having anticipated a reaction like Toyoda's, planned to drop a second bomb shortly after the first, to convince the Japanese that the U.S. had a large supply.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} high schools using the Redskins {{name has been}} in steady decline, 40% having had local efforts to change the name. From 1988 until April 2013, 28 high schools in 18 <b>states</b> <b>had</b> done so, 62 schools using the name at that time. Since that list was compiled, other high school teams have dropped the name, {{including}} four affected by a 2015 California law.|$|E

Furthermore, 6 of those ratifying <b>states</b> <b>have</b> reservations limiting {{the extent to which they}} are bound to certain provisions. Notably, the UK and Germany have neither signed nor ratified the convention. The UK considered the convention too restrictive, whereas Germany thought it too permissive.|$|R
