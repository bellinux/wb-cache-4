500|$|While rehabilitating, Jeter {{suffered}} a <b>small</b> <b>crack</b> {{in the area}} of his previous ankle fracture. As a result, Jeter began the 2013 season on the disabled list. The Yankees activated Jeter on July 11, but after playing in one game, Jeter returned to the disabled list with a quadriceps strain. He returned to the Yankees lineup on July 28, hitting a home run on the first pitch off of Matt Moore of Tampa Bay. Jeter was again placed on the 15-day disabled list on August 5 due to a Grade 1 calf strain, and after a brief return to the lineup, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list for a third time on September 11 due to problems with his ankle, ending his season. On September 14, 2013 Jeter was transferred to the 60-day disabled list. Jeter batted [...]190 in only 17 games played during the 2013 season.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> on the dynamic {{propagation}} of a macrocrack is investigated by using a new continuum mechanics formulation, peridynamics. Various combinations of <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> with different number, location and density are considered. Depending on the location, density and number of <b>small</b> <b>cracks,</b> the propagation speed of macrocrack differs. Some combinations of <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> slows down the propagation of a macrocrack by 34 %.

40|$|We {{examine the}} growth of microstructurally <b>small</b> fatigue <b>cracks</b> in cast AM 60 B {{magnesium}} (Mg) cycled in a water vapor environment. The behavior and growth rates of the <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> were measured in situ during cycling using a fatigue loading stage contained within an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). We provide quantitative data describing the interaction of representative <b>small</b> fatigue <b>cracks</b> with microstructural features, along with the average growth rate data for approximately 20 different <b>cracks.</b> <b>Small</b> surface and corner cracks, with sizes ranging from 20 to 200 µm, are observed to interact strongly with the surface microstructure during growth. The <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> preferentially propagate through the dendrite cells, and the particle laden interdendritic regions typically act as barriers to fatigue crack propagation. As the <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> approach the interdendritic boundaries, measured growth rates decrease and the cracks sometimes becomes temporarily pinned at the boundary. <b>Cracks</b> <b>smaller</b> than 100 µm experience more significant disruptions in crack growth rates at interdendritic boundaries compared to the larger cracks that interact with the boundaries, but with less change in crack growth rates. Under nominally identical loading conditions, isolated microstructurally <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> grow, on average, two orders of magnitude faster in a sample containing a higher fraction of porosity. The significantly higher crack growth rates in the more porous sample were attributed to local amplification of the nominal stress field {{in the vicinity of}} the microstructurally <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> rather than explicit interactions between growing cracks and pores. Analogous to the wrought materials, the growth rate of microstructurally <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> is observed to be significantly higher compared to long fatigue cracks at equivalent maximum cyclic stress intensity values...|$|R

2500|$|Mr Joseph Clark, {{a member}} of parliament, had flown in Tokana five days prior to the crash. [...] Two Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{aircraft}} mechanics who were fellow-passengers had shown him a <b>small</b> <b>crack</b> in the aircraft's elevator hinge bracket. Clark had advised the two to tell the pilot about the crack if {{they thought it was}} serious. After the crash, Clark reported this conversation to the Minister for Civil Aviation and made a statement to the press. [...] He repeated his statement in the House of Representatives. There was also criticism from Mr Thomas White that the Investigation Panel's report had not focussed attention on the major alteration involved in the conversion from a three-engined aeroplane to a two-engined aeroplane. Thomas White was {{a member of}} parliament and a former RAAF group captain. Following this criticism in the Parliament House of Representatives the Minister for Civil Aviation, Arthur Drakeford, appointed Mr Justice Philp of the Supreme Court of Queensland to conduct an inquiry into the accident using the powers of the National Security Act.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the time}} comes for the {{caterpillar}} to create its chrysalis it turns a grayish color and begins to spin a silk-like substance into a ball on top or against a malleable surface. It then attaches its rear end to the [...] "silk" [...] lump and hangs upside down in a [...] "j" [...] position. By small contractions of the muscles it begins to shed its skin and head revealing a soft pinkish tan form. Quickly the soft form hardens and becomes grayish brown. The chrysalis stays in this form for eleven to twenty-one days. After that period of time, a <b>small</b> <b>crack</b> begins to form {{at the tip of}} the chrysalis revealing the butterfly's head. It continues to slowly move down through the bottom of the chrysalis until its legs are free to cling onto the shell of the chrysalis and pull itself the rest of the way out. Much like the monarch butterfly, it begins to pump the fluids from its bulging abdomen into its shriveled wings. When its wings are fully expanded it releases excess fluids from its abdomen. For the next ten to fifteen minutes it stays still and allows its wings to dry. Finally it fans its wings out and takes flight.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the basic {{mechanisms}} of fatigue damage in materials exposed to service {{and a series of}} nondestructive techniques for the early detection of this damage. For all materials with reasonably high fracture toughness it is the organized motion of dislocations that either forms extrusions/intrusions (surface roughness) or the piling up of dislocations at grain boundaries or interface boundaries whose unzipping forms <b>small</b> <b>cracks.</b> Some of these <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> grow, coalesce with other <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> and eventually form the large crack which will terminate the life of the structure, if it grows to a size that is large enough (at a given stress level) to reach the fracture toughness of the material. The time scale of these events is roughly: First <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> (a ≈ 0. 1 μm) initiate at ≈ 10 % of the total life; large cracks appear (a ≈ 0. 5 mm) at ≈ 90 % of the total life. Details depend on the microstructure of the material, the applied stress and other environmental factors. Over the past thirty years, researchers have tried to follow this sequence of events with a variety of experimental techniques that are adjusted to the specific defect type to be detected (dislocations, <b>small</b> <b>cracks,</b> and large cracks). Some of these techniques are briefly reviewed...|$|R

Three additional nuggets had been unearthed, one as large as a pint measure and finer in appearance than any of the rest. Making sure they were not observed, the first nuggets were again brought forth, and each took a portion of them to carry home. The largest was tied up in Earl's coat, which he slung carelessly over his shoulder as he trudged along.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe role of <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> on {{fatigue life}} {{and loss of}} {{ductility}} are discussed to understand the reality of fatigue damage in low cycle fatigue. The series of low cycle fatigue tests were carried out {{paying attention to the}} role of <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> and its influence on ductility loss. These tests showed that the fatigue lives were pronouncedly extended by removing surface cracks. Also, it was quantified that the loss of fracture ductility was correlated with crack length but not with the number of fatigue cycles. From those results, it is elucidated that the behavior of <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> is crucial to explain the mechanism of low cycle fatigue damage rather than the crack initiation process and change in bulk material properties...|$|R

40|$|The fatigue of {{mechanical}} components {{can be explained}} by the growth of very <b>small</b> fatigue <b>cracks,</b> which lead to the final fracture of the component. It is, therefore, essential to try to describe the growth and the thresholds of <b>small</b> <b>cracks.</b> In this paper, the Strip-Yield model is used to analyse the fatigue thresholds of a mild-steel widely used for manufacturing railway axles. Furthermore, the need for a precise definition of the constraint factor, under cyclic, non-linear response of the material, is addressed, together with the choice of an appropriate constraint formulation. This results in good fatigue threshold predictions at R = 1 for long cracks (obtained from SE(B) specimens), whereas the description of the Kitagawa diagram (obtained by fatigue tests on specimens with artificial defects) is relatively poor. The analysis of the cyclic stress ahead of <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> enables us to compare the results with the threshold models for <b>small</b> <b>cracks</b> by McEvily, Usami and Shida...|$|R
