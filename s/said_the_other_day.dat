6000|$|... "You <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> that you'd be {{perfectly}} happy {{if you could}} only go to Annie Moffat's," [...] observed Beth in her quiet way.|$|E
6000|$|Percy Beaumont, however, {{continued}} {{to aim at}} lucidity. “You don’t, it’s true, quite redeem your threats. You <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> you’d make your mother call.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Mary {{the younger}} {{could not help}} rising from her corner to say, 'Indeed, Louis <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> that you never had denied him any {{personal}} indulgence.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are doing}} very well here, Mr. Atherton. You <b>said</b> only <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> that your {{consignment}} of plants had sold wonderfully, and that you expected to make nearly a thousand pounds this year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't see the {{necessity}} of her being so mysterious about it," [...] declared the girl. [...] "Josie ought to know I'm worthy of her confidence. And she <b>said,</b> just <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> that we're partners." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{say nothing}} else--I {{say it all}} <b>the</b> while. I <b>said</b> it <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> a dozen times." [...] Fleda made no {{immediate}} rejoinder to this, and before she could choose one he repeated his question of a moment before. [...] "Am I to tell my solicitor to act?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very true, Mr. Tadpole. A {{wise man}} {{would do well}} now {{to look to the}} great middle class, as I <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> to the electors of Shabbyton.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> {{you thought}} we were a deal happier than the King children, for they were {{fighting}} and fretting all the time, {{in spite of their}} money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will be a}} long business, I am afraid," [...] said Richard. [...] "Indeed, he <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> {{he thought}} he should never have the free use of the elbow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{greater power}} for education," [...] <b>said</b> President Shurman <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> [...] "has come among us {{during the last}} forty years than the moving picture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not {{too late}} for me to justify myself," [...] replied the doctor. [...] "We have long known each other, Mr Gresham, and you <b>said</b> here <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> {{that this is a}} subject as to which we have been both of one mind. Birth and blood are very {{valuable}} gifts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, I'm {{sorry for}} what I <b>said</b> to you <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> an' for--for everythin' else. I guess I was a bit lit up. I beg pardon." ...|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR SIR:--You {{ask me to}} put {{in writing}} the {{substance}} of what I verbally <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> in your presence, to Governor Bramlette and Senator Dixon. It was about as follows: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} yet. In the first place, I want to try whether what you <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> is correct, and if I can stand the noise of firing without flinching." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose we}} shall ever get there," [...] Ruth said. [...] "Amuba <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> {{that this country}} lay a great {{distance}} further than the land my people came from a long time ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bravo, Mr. Stone!" [...] said he. [...] "You have an {{excellent}} touch; and I know what I am talking about when I speak of music. Cramer, of <b>the</b> Opera, <b>said</b> only <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> that he had rather hand his baton to me than to any amateur in England. Halloa, it's Charlie Fox, by all that's wonderful!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The artist, you know. You {{remember}} you <b>said</b> at lunch <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> you wanted your little boy's portrait painted, as you {{only had one}} of him, aged eleven--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Faith, nor I," [...] {{said her}} husband. [...] "But she is willing, {{provided}} {{she can have}} <b>the</b> child. She <b>said</b> so only <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> when I talked o't!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Susy aged eleven, Jean three.--Susy <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> {{when she}} [...] saw Jean {{bringing}} a cat {{to me of}} her own motion, [...] "Jean has found [...] out already that mamma loves morals and papa loves cats." ...|$|E
60|$|RIDGEON. I <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> {{that the}} most tragic {{thing in the world}} is a sick doctor. I was wrong. The most tragic thing in the world is a man of genius who is not also a man of honor.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} ask you again about {{something}} you <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day.</b> Perhaps it was half of it your lively way of speaking: I notice that you like to put things strongly; I myself often exaggerate when I speak hastily." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That, my dear,' said Aunt Polly, 'is {{because you}} do not {{interest}} yourself about such matters. If you had heard what <b>the</b> Archdeacon <b>said</b> of him <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> you would think differently.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{neglected}} {{certain parts}} of this speech in <b>the</b> interest of <b>others.</b> [...] "Marie <b>said</b> to me <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> that she felt him to have the makings of an immense man of business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will, this is--I {{must get}} this straight. Some one <b>said</b> to me <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> that in towns like this, {{even more than}} in cities, all the doctors hate each <b>other,</b> because of <b>the</b> money----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can see her}} quite distinctly. You <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> {{that she}} was fine in figure; roundly built; had deep red lips like Cupid's bow; dark eyelashes and brows, an immense rope of hair like a ship's cable; and large eyes violety-bluey-blackish." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In sooth it is! A drop {{of royal}} blood is {{in these days}} a mere drop of poison to them that have the ill luck to inherit it. As my lord <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> it brings the headsman's axe after it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lor' bless you, Miss, {{she would}} do {{anything}} for you; she <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> she would, and that she did not care whether she lost her place or not; {{she did not want to}} stop with thieves. Oh, you may depend on her, Miss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] he said, [...] "there's big proof {{coming of}} what I <b>said</b> to you <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day.</b> You'll find that letter you carry will mean a {{different}} thing now. There's news in the air." ...|$|R
6000|$|Your friend ---- ---- {{is setting}} {{the world right}} {{generally}} all round (including the flattened ends, the two poles), and, as a Minister <b>said</b> to me <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> [...] "has <b>the</b> one little fault of omniscience." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{does not}} want to marry you--don't be vain; but she <b>said</b> to me <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> 'My dear, Mr. Moore has {{pleasing}} manners; {{he is one of the}} few gentlemen I have seen who combine politeness with an air of sincerity.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{why do you}} {{get into}} scrapes?" [...] the girl said. [...] "If you didn't, you wouldn't be {{suspected}} of other things. Mamma <b>said,</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> you got into more scrapes than any boy in the village; and you look nice, too. Why do you do it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} me {{just the same}} as now! Yes, I think I can promise THAT. Let that suffice. You <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> you liked me because I had not changed for five years. You can surely trust that I will not alter in as many months." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{is one to}} help one's-self? She {{has a way of}} {{whispering}} to Gertrude, and to her mother, when I am there, which almost kills me. 'If you'll only give me notice I'll go out of the room at once,' I <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> and they were all so angry." ...|$|E
60|$|But we {{must not}} be atheists, as a friend <b>said</b> to me <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day.</b> I hope I do not live quite as if I were. But {{it was a great}} shock from the beginning. Henrietta always seemed so strong that I never feared that way.|$|R
6000|$|And yet at {{last that}} point, too, was reached. One {{day they were}} wrangling about somewhat, as they too often wrangled, and Hereward in his temper let fall the words. [...] "As I <b>said</b> to Winter <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> you grow harder and harder upon me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, that's Julius," [...] {{explained}} Tuppence. [...] "I'm rather nervous, {{and that}} makes me tell it badly. What I {{really want to know}} is what you meant by what you <b>said</b> to me <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day?</b> Did you mean to warn me against Mrs. Vandemeyer? You did, didn't you?" ...|$|R
