5|$|As {{the family}} eats breakfast the next morning, Lois reveals her {{intention}} {{to become a}} surrogate mother for Naomi and Dale, causing Peter to become upset {{at the thought of}} her being pregnant for nine months. Despite this, Lois decides to go to Dr. Hartman to have the in vitro fertilization performed, enduring more of Dr. Hartman's shtick involving celebrity crossbreeds and having a tribe of bush men implant the egg with blowguns. A pregnancy test comes back positive the next day, and a furious Peter attempts to cause Lois to have a miscarriage before ultimately confronting her about the pregnancy. While she continues asserting her intention to provide a child to Naomi and Dale, Quahog 5 News suddenly reveals that Naomi and Dale died in a car crash on Interstate 95. Devastated by the announcement, Lois questions whether she <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> abortion or continue with the pregnancy and put the baby up for adoption.|$|E

5|$|Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were {{determined}} that their eldest son <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> education that would prepare {{him to be}} a model constitutional monarch. At age seven, Edward embarked on a rigorous educational programme devised by Prince Albert, and supervised by several tutors. Unlike his elder sister Victoria, Edward did not excel in his studies. He tried to meet the expectations of his parents, but to no avail. Although Edward was not a diligent student—his true talents were those of charm, sociability and tact—Benjamin Disraeli described him as informed, intelligent and of sweet manner. After the completion of his secondary-level studies, his tutor was replaced by a personal governor, Robert Bruce.|$|E
5|$|A {{mendelevium}} atom has 101 electrons, {{of which}} at least three (and perhaps four) can act as valence electrons. They {{are expected to be}} arranged in the configuration 5f137s2 (ground state term symbol 2F7/2), although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006. In forming compounds, three valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind a 5f12 core: this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of mendelevium was measured to be at most (6.58±0.07)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before the 5f ones; this value has since not yet been refined further due to mendelevium's scarcity and high radioactivity. The ionic radius of hexacoordinate Md3+ had been preliminarily estimated in 1978 to be around 91.2pm; 1988 calculations based on the logarithmic trend between distribution coefficients and ionic radius produced a value of 89.6pm, as well as an enthalpy of hydration of −(3654±12)kJ·mol−1. Md2+ <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> ionic radius of 115pm and hydration enthalpy −1413kJ·mol−1; Md+ should have ionic radius 117pm.|$|E
5|$|So far, no {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} synthesize any element {{that could be the}} next group 3 element; if lutetium and lawrencium are considered to be group 3 elements, then the next element in the group should be element 153, unpenttrium (Upt). However, after element 120, filling electronic configurations stops obeying Aufbau principle. According to the principle, unpenttrium <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> electronic configuration of 8s25g186f147d1 and filling the 5g-subshell should be stopped at element 138. However, the 7d-orbitals are calculated to start being filled on element 137, while the 5g-subshell closes only at element 144, after filling of 7d-subshell begins. Therefore, it is hard to calculate which element should be the next group 3 element. Calculations suggest that unpentpentium (Upp, element 155) could also be the next group 3 element. If lanthanum and actinium are considered group 3 elements, then element 121, unbiunium (Ubu), should be the fifth group 3 element. The element is calculated have electronic configuration of 8s28p1/21, which is not associated with transition metals, without having a partially filled d-subshell. No experiments have been performed to create unpenttrium, unbiunium or any element that could be considered the next group 3 element; however, unbiunium is the element with the lowest atomic number that has not been tried to be created and thus has chances to be, while unpenttrium, unpentpentium or any other element considered if preceded by lawrencium is very unlikely to be created due to drip instabilities that imply that the periodic table ends soon after the island of stability at unbihexium.|$|E

5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of nihonium has yet to have been established. The isotopes 284Nh, 285Nh, and 286Nh have half-lives long enough for chemical investigation. It is theoretically predicted that nihonium <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> enthalpy of sublimation around 150kJ/mol and an enthalpy of adsorption on a gold surface around −159kJ/mol. From 2010 to 2012, some preliminary chemical experiments were performed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research to determine the volatility of nihonium. The reaction used was 243Am(48Ca,3n)288Mc; the isotope 288Mc has a short half-life and would quickly decay to the longer-lived 284Nh, which would be chemically investigated. Teflon capillaries at 70°C connecting the recoil chamber, where the nihonium atoms were synthesized, and the gold-covered detectors: the nihonium atoms would be carried along the capillaries by a carrier gas. While about ten to twenty atoms of 284Nh were produced, none of these atoms were registered by the gold-covered detectors, suggesting either that nihonium was similar in volatility to the noble gases or, more plausibly, that pure nihonium was not very volatile and thus could not efficiently pass through the Teflon capillaries at 70°C. Formation of the hydroxide NhOH would ease the transport, as nihonium hydroxide {{is expected to be}} more volatile than elemental nihonium, and this reaction could be facilitated by adding more water vapor into the carrier gas. However, it seems likely that this formation is not kinetically favored, so that the longer-lived isotope 286Nh, created as the granddaughter of 294Ts, might be more desirable for future experiments.|$|E
