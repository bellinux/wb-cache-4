5|$|<b>Satellite</b> <b>observations</b> {{record a}} {{decrease}} in snow-covered areas since the 1960s, when satellites when <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> began. In some areas, including China, snow cover has increased. In some regions such as China, a trend of increasing snow cover has been observed from 1978 to 2006. These changes are attributed to global climate change, which may lead to earlier melting and less aea coverage. However, in some areas {{there may be an}} increase in snow depth because of higher temperatures for latitudes north of 40Â°. For the Northern Hemisphere as a whole the mean monthly snow-cover extent has been decreasing by 1.3% per decade.|$|E

5|$|Activity in {{the central}} Pacific was also above average. Two {{tropical}} storms formed, as did several tropical depressions. A number of storms moved in from the east. With a total of nine tropical cyclones entering or forming there, this was the fourth highest number since <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> began. The first storm formed on June 1. The last storm dissipated December 21, which gives this season the latest known end.

5|$|As Jerry {{entered the}} eastern Caribbean Sea early on October 8 after {{bypassing}} St. Vincent, its forward speed increased to 25 mph (40km/h), and reconnaissance aircraft observations indicated a broad circulation with several small rotations but an ill-defined low-level center. Later, <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> {{indicated that the}} storm was poorly organized, with an elongated cloud mass and displaced secondary center to the northwest. Moderate vertical wind shear from the northwest developed, disrupting Jerry's upper-level outflow. Jerry continued to deteriorate, and later on October 8, aircraft data indicated the system had weakened into a broad {{area of low pressure}} with scattered squalls mainly to the east of the remnant center. Jerry then dissipated shortly afterward approximately 230miles south of Puerto Rico, with the remnants moving westward.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fred {{was one of}} the easternmost forming major hurricanes in the North Atlantic basin since <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> became available. Forming out of {{a strong}} {{tropical}} wave on September7, 2009 near the Cape Verde Islands, Fred gradually organized within an area of moderate wind shear. The following day, decreasing shear allowed the storm to intensify and develop well-organized convective banding features. Later on September8, Fred attained hurricane intensity and underwent rapid intensification overnight, attaining its peak intensity as a strong Category 3 hurricane with winds of 120mph (195km/h) and a barometric pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg). Shortly after reaching this intensity, the hurricane began to weaken as wind shear increased and dry air hampered convective development.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} {{retained a}} large circulation during its formative stages, {{as indicated by}} both <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> and data from rawinsondes. As its cloud pattern continued to coalesce, the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Gert at 0900UTC on September15. After tracking west-northwestward, {{the center of the}} storm moved ashore near Bluefields, Nicaragua, around 1800UTC that day, with winds of 40mph (65km/h). Its interaction with land impeded further development, and Gert weakened back to a tropical depression six hours later. Despite the center being inland for nearly two days, parts of the large circulation stayed over the adjacent Caribbean and Pacific waters. This allowed Gert to remain a tropical cyclone while trekking northwestward through Nicaragua and Honduras, defying the NHC's repeated forecasts of its dissipation over land.|$|E
5|$|Around 2100UTC on September20, Gert made a final {{landfall}} at {{peak intensity}} {{on the coast}} of Mexico, just north of Tuxpan, Veracruz. The hurricane accelerated and weakened rapidly over the mountainous region of the Sierra Madre Oriental, diminishing to a tropical depression by September21. Despite the degeneration, the large circulation remained intact as it crossed the country. Gert exited the coast of Nayarit and entered the Pacific Ocean later that day, where the NHC reclassified it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. The remaining deep convection waxed and waned in intensity; <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> indicated the depression could have briefly been a tropical storm on September22. It continued a west to west-northwestward motion for two days, though low-level flow steered it toward the southwest after the convection diminished. There was no redevelopment due to cool sea temperatures, and the system dissipated at sea on September26.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Julia was the easternmost Category4 {{hurricane}} {{recorded in}} the Atlantic basin since reliable <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> became available. The twelfth tropical cyclone, fifth hurricane and fourth major hurricane of the 2010Atlantic hurricane season, Julia rapidly developed on September12 from a tropical wave near Cape Verde. Passing near the islands, the system quickly organized into Tropical Storm Julia the next day. On September14, Julia attained hurricane status and subsequently entered a trend of rapid intensification; the storm strengthened from a minimal hurricane to a low-end Category4 in only 24hours. After peaking in intensity, further development was impeded as interaction with nearby Hurricane Igor began to occur; the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm by September18. It subsequently moved into a region of unfavorable conditions, heading toward lower sea surface temperatures. Correspondingly, Julia entered an extratropical transition on September20, and advisories on the storm were discontinued by that time.|$|E

5|$|In late September, a {{large area}} of {{disturbed}} weather associated with two tropical waves formed {{just east of the}} Lesser Antilles. The disturbance drifted very slowly west-northwestward, inhibited by strong wind shear that eventually caused the westernmost wave to dissipate. Albeit weak, an elongated remnant trough, or area of low pressure, persisted for several days, stalling over the extreme eastern Caribbean Sea as a nearby upper-level cyclonic vortex retrograded to its north. By October5, the trough had drifted northward into a more favorable atmospheric environment over the Virgin Islands, which allowed the lowest pressures to extend to the surface. The low became well defined, interacting with the adjacent upper vortex to produce a wide convective banda concentrated region in which strong showers and thunderstorms can formover the northeastern Caribbean. Over the next day, the system continued to acquire a prominent subtropical structure: it developed a markedly larger wind radius than typically seen in pure tropical cyclones. <b>Satellite</b> <b>observations</b> also revealed that although the lower wind circulation was distinct, it had become intertwined with the cyclonic vortex aloft to its southwest, confirming the hybrid nature of the system. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) thus classified the system as a subtropical depression at 06:00UTC on October6, when it was 265mi (425km) north-northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|On July10, a {{tropical}} wave exited the African coast and moved westward over the open Atlantic for several days. Initially, the associated weather activity {{was limited to}} weak showers, and environmental conditions were not forecast to become conducive for significant organization. Although upper-level wind shear remained somewhat adverse, a process of slow development became evident by July19 as surface pressures began to fall. The wave proceeded along the extreme northeastern Caribbean, where convective activity waxed and waned due to periods of variable wind shear and brief land interaction with Hispaniola. By July22, thundershower activity reestablished over the Bahamas, with a distinct {{area of low pressure}} centered between the islands of Acklins and Great Inagua. <b>Satellite</b> <b>observations</b> confirmed a closed circulation, leading the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to issue the formation of Tropical Depression Three around 1500UTC. However, post-storm analysis indicated that a depression had developed nine hours earlier than operationally confirmed. Upon its formation, the depression was forecast to be steered to the west-northwest along a well-established subtropical ridge. Later that day, minimum pressure dropped to 1006mbar (29.74inHg), and satellite imagery showed an establishment of favorable outflow in nearly all quadrants. Although its cloud pattern remained disorganizedwith the circulation center disassociated from the deepest convectiona reconnaissance aircraft flight into the cyclone found that the winds had increased. It was therefore upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie southeast of Nassau, Bahamas, about five hours after NHC initiated advisories on the system.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} slid slowly northwestward {{between the}} contiguous upper vortex {{and a large}} high-pressure region over the central Atlantic. A region of lighter wind shear ahead, {{as well as an}} anticipated weakening of the upper cyclone, prompted the NHC to introduce the possibility of a tropical transition. Later, <b>satellite</b> <b>observations</b> showed a rapid improvement in the depression's structure; convective banding wrapped completely around the broad inner wind field, which produced gusts to 65mph (105km/h). Accordingly, the NHC upgraded the depression to Subtropical Storm Otto at 21:00UTC on October6, about 215mi (345km) northeast of Grand Turk. Although satellite images continued to display a classical subtropical cyclone, with Otto's center and the vortex aloft nearly collocated, data from a Hurricane Hunters aircraft indicated a weak warm convective core was developing within the mid levels of the circulationâa feature normally present at the upper levels of tropical cyclones. Moreover, a contraction of the large wind field reaffirmed that Otto was entering the final stages of its tropical transition. Although convective activity briefly weakened overnight, weakening shear and considerably warmer sea surface temperatures permitted small patches of thunderstorms to refire on the morning of October7. As Otto meandered northward, temperature contrasts from forecast models indicated that the warm core within the circulation had ascended to the upper levels of the cyclone. In consequence, a burst of deep, tropical convection with extreme cloud top temperatures of approximately 112Â°F (80Â°C) occurred over the center. Having shed the last of its subtropical characteristics, Otto became a warm-core system and was operationally declared tropical at 1200UTC that day.|$|E

25|$|The {{decline in}} Arctic sea ice, both in extent and thickness, {{over the last}} several decades is further {{evidence}} for rapid climate change.

40|$|The {{vulnerability}} of Africa {{to the impact}} of climate change, which results in natural disasters and environmental degradation, accelerates hardship and poverty for millions of Africans. However, Africa still lacks the necessary scientific and technical capacity to assess fully and to monitor the possible future impacts of climate change. One of the instruments available to address the challenges of environmental monitoring (including climate change) and to provide early warnings of natural and human-made disasters for Africa's development is Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites.</b> Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> record Earth's information from space and provide accurate, continuous, simultaneous measurements of our planet. The results of the application of Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> have long term social benefits which include the early detection of hurricanes and typhoons that can lead to prompt warnings for areas predicted to be affected, thus providing crucial time to implement safety measures to mitigate the effects of such disasters. Several authors concur with this position, stating that the global view from <b>satellite</b> <b>observation</b> is unmatched in its ability to capture the dynamics and variability of Earth processes. The capability to predict weather (among other things) has led Earth <b>observation</b> <b>satellites</b> to become essential to everyday applications that improve human safety and quality of life.
