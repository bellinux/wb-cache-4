500|$|A {{number of}} game-playing {{involving}} carnival masks, men, lions, werelions are portrayed with allusions to eighteenth-century practices and Saint Mark. Sheila Whiteley, author of Women and popular music: sexuality, identity, and subjectivity, felt that Madonna's image signified {{a denial of}} sexual knowledge, but also portrayed her in simulated writhing on a gondola, thus underpinning the simulation of deceit. The intrusion of a male lion, confirmed the underlying bestial discourse of both mythological fairy tale and pornographic sex. Whiteley observed that in the video, Madonna's lover wears the lion's mask and while cavorting with him, Madonna sheds the veneer of innocence and shows her propensity for wild animal passions. Having instilled desire, metaphorically <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> lover into a Beast. Madonna commented about shooting with the lion: ...|$|E
500|$|The green-head ant {{is known}} for its rarity of virgin queens, with some nests {{occasionally}} producing winged females; queens are able to establish their own colonies in captivity, but out in the wild they have never been seen to establish a colony, suggesting that the species is losing its queen caste. The majority of observations show males mating with workers, but not queens. One factor further suggesting the loss of the queen caste is that the green-head ant is going through an evolutionary process where queens are a rare morphological form with little significance, so workers usually replace the queens and take on the reproductive role. Queens still undertake the role of nuptial flight as some have been seen mating with males. They are known to release a sex pheromone from the pygidial gland, an exocrine gland found between the last two abdominal segments. The ergatoid (wingless reproductive females) queens emerge from their nest and, like the workers, appress their head onto the ground and elevate their gaster, from which the intersegmental membrane {{at the back of the}} abdomen extends. The queens then release the sex pheromones, which attracts the males, who frantically search for the queens through agitated locomotion. The males may attempt to copulate with workers that did not [...] "call" [...] for them, suggesting that workers might be able to release these pheromones. When a male makes contact with a queen, the male touches her with his antennae and grasps the female's thorax with his mandibles. A queen is ready to mate when <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> abdomen to the side, where the male will search for the genitalia with his copulatory apparatus (parts of the organ involved with copulation). The pair may copulate for several minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Austen's irony {{goes beyond}} the {{sentence}} level. As Austen scholar Jan Fergus explains, [...] "the major structural device in Pride and Prejudice {{is the creation of}} ironies within the novel's action which, like parallels and contrasts, challenge the reader's attention and judgment throughout, and in the end also engage his feelings." [...] Austen's irony illuminates the foibles of individual characters and her society. In her later novels, in particular, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> irony [...] "against the errors of law, manners and customs, in failing to recognize women as the accountable beings they are, or ought to be".|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} favourably {{reviewed}} by The Daily Telegraph. Reviewer Neil McCormick praised her more personal {{songs on the}} album: [...] "It is when <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> sharp tongue to her own affairs of the heart that Allen's growing adventurousness and lyrical confidence really pay off....But in particular 'Who'd Have Known' is a tender evocation of friendship turning to love, in which the detail is telling and Allen's vocal performance positively glows with easy affection. On such songs, Allen still sounds like a real person telling us the most intimate details of her real life, only with better hooks." [...] McCormick also praised the lead single as [...] "superb" [...] and [...] "an ironic declaration of celebrity superficiality set to a pulsing, sleekly modern electro dance backing." ...|$|E

60|$|The Bishop {{comes out}} of his study. He is still a slim active man, spare of flesh, and younger by {{temperament}} than his brothers. He has a delicate skin, fine hands, a salient nose with chin to match, a short beard which accentuates his sharp chin by bristling forward, clever humorous eyes, not without a glint of mischief in them, ready bright speech, and the ways of a successful man who is always interested in himself and generally rather well pleased with himself. When Lesbia hears his voice <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> chair towards him, and presently rises and stands in the doorway listening to the conversation.|$|E
