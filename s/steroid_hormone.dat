5|$|When a T-cell {{encounters}} a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin D receptor. This {{is essentially a}} signaling device that allows the T-cell to bind to the active form of vitamin D, the <b>steroid</b> <b>hormone</b> calcitriol. T-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin D. Not only does the T-cell extend a vitamin D receptor, in essence asking to bind to the <b>steroid</b> <b>hormone</b> version of vitamin D, calcitriol, but the T-cell expresses the gene CYP27B1, which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D, calcidiol into the <b>steroid</b> <b>hormone</b> version, calcitriol. Only after binding to calcitriol can T-cells perform their intended function. Other immune system cells that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol, are dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the signaling pathways described above, hippocampal LTP may be altered {{by a variety of}} modulators. For example, the <b>steroid</b> <b>hormone</b> estradiol may enhance LTP by driving CREB phosphorylation and subsequent dendritic spine growth. Additionally, Î²-adrenergic receptor agonists such as norepinephrine may alter the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP. Nitric oxide synthase activity may also result in the subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG. Similarly, activation of dopamine receptors may enhance LTP through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.|$|E
5|$|Thehuman genomeincludes {{approximately}} 20,000 protein coding {{genes and}} 70% of thesegenes are expressedin the normal, adult adrenal glands.Only some 250 genes are more specifically {{expressed in the}} adrenal glands compared to other organs and tissues.The adrenal gland specific genes with highest level of expression include members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. Corresponding proteins are expressed in the different compartments of the adrenal gland, such as CYP11A1, HSD3B2 and FDX1 involved in <b>steroid</b> <b>hormone</b> synthesis and expressed in cortical cell layers, and PNMT and DBH involved in noradrenalin and adrenalin synthesis and expressed in the medulla.|$|E
40|$|The non-genomic {{action of}} <b>steroid</b> <b>hormones</b> regulates {{a wide variety}} of {{cellular}} responses including regulation of ion transport, cell proliferation, migration, death and differentiation. In order to achieve such plethora of effects <b>steroid</b> <b>hormones</b> utilize nearly all known signal transduction pathways. One of the key signalling molecules regulating the non-genomic action of <b>steroid</b> <b>hormones</b> is protein kinase C (PKC). It is thought that rapid action of <b>steroids</b> <b>hormones</b> results from the activation of plasma membrane receptors; however, their molecular identity remains elusive. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have pointed at the selective binding and activation of specific PKC isoforms by <b>steroid</b> <b>hormones.</b> This has led to the hypothesis that PKC could act as a receptor as well as a transducer of the non-genomic effects of these hormones. In this review we summarize the current knowledge of the direct binding and activation of PKC by <b>steroid</b> <b>hormones...</b>|$|R

25|$|GPCR linked {{proteins}} {{most likely}} interact with <b>steroid</b> <b>hormones</b> through an amino acid consensus sequence traditionally {{thought of as}} a cholesterol recognition and interaction site. About a third of Class A GPCRs contain this sequence. The <b>steroid</b> <b>hormones</b> themselves are different enough from one another that they do not all affect all of the GPCR linked proteins; however, the similarities between the <b>steroid</b> <b>hormones</b> and between the receptors make plausible the argument that each receptor may respond to multiple <b>steroid</b> <b>hormones</b> or that each hormone could affect multiple receptors. This is contrary to the traditional model of having a unique receptor for each unique ligand.|$|R

40|$|The {{modulation}} of <b>steroid</b> <b>hormones</b> on {{brain is}} attracting {{more and more}} attention. However, the detection of <b>steroid</b> <b>hormones</b> is faced with great challenge owning to the very low content in brain tissue. In this work, the preparation conditions of <b>steroid</b> <b>hormones</b> extracted from brain tissue were optimized. Ethanol was the best extraction solvent for brain homogenization as it readily penetrated cell membranes and was a good solvent for <b>steroid</b> <b>hormones.</b> After purified by Oasis HLB SPE, the matrix effect was reduced significantly. An on-line capillary solid phase extraction -nano liquid chromatographic system was built based on valve-switching 75 mu m i. d. trap column and analytical column. Tandem mass spectrometer with NanoESI source {{was used as the}} detector for the determination of ten brain <b>steroid</b> <b>hormones.</b> The method showed good precision (intraday RSD 4. 5 % - 12. 8 % and inter day RSD 8. 3 % - 20. 3 %) and linearity (r> 0. 995). The limits of detection in solution were from 20 ng/L to 10 mu g/L for 10 <b>steroid</b> <b>hormones.</b> The sensitivity of the method was gained in two orders of magnitude compared with that of conventional HPLC/MS when the equal amounts of the <b>steroid</b> <b>hormones</b> were injected. The recoveries were above 60 % at three concentrations except for androsterone while the matrix effect was inapparent except for progesterone. Brain tissue samples from mouse were analyzed using the new method. Four steroids were identified and quantified including testosterone 0. 47 ng/g, corticosterone 26. 2 ng/g, aldosterone 0. 49 ng/g and hydrocortisone 0. 06 ng/g.

25|$|In {{addition}} to its activity as a <b>steroid</b> <b>hormone,</b> progesterone is a neurosteroid.

Through potentiation of the GABAA receptor, progesterone can produce sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, euphoric, cognitive-, memory-, and motor-impairing, anticonvulsant, and even anesthetic effects via formation of sufficiently high concentrations of its neurosteroid metabolites.|$|E
