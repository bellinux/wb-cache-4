Three different hybridisation techniques (intra-yarn, intra-layer and inter-layer) were investigated. In intra-yarn hybridisation, tows were comprised of a combination of carbon fibres and oriented PA 12 multifilaments. In intra-layer hybridisation, carbon fibre/PA 12 prepreg tapes were co-woven with oriented PA 12 tapes. Finally, in interlayer hybridisation, carbon fibre spread tow cloth was impregnated with PA 12 matrix polymer and then laminated with layers of a <b>self</b> <b>reinforced</b> PA 12 sheet. In all cases, the hybrid composites were manufactured using the Leeds hot compaction technique.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of particulate filled polymers are influenced significantly by interfacial interactions. The adhesion between the polymer and the filler {{depends on the}} area of the interface and the strength of the interaction. The former is related to specific area of the filler while the strength of the interaction can be modified by surface treatment. This study is focused on comparing the reinforcing ability of muscovite and phlogopite with and without surface treatment. Muscovite and phlogopite are two common forms of mica. Mechanical properties such as Young's modulus, tensile strength, elongation and impact strength were used to compare the reinforcing ability of muscovite and phlogopite in EVA composites. The Young's modulus of the surface treated and non-surface treated composites increased with an increase in filler loading. <b>Composites</b> <b>reinforced</b> with muscovite had similar moduli compared to <b>composites</b> <b>reinforced</b> with phlogopite. The tensile strength of phlogopite <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> increased with an increase in filler content while that of muscovite <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> remained constant. Surface modification by both silane and stearic acid reduced the tensile strength of phlogopite <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites.</b> The tensile strength of stearic acid treated muscovite <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> improved but not to the same extent as the silane treated composites. Both muscovite and phlogopite lead to a lowering of the impact strength at high filler loadings while the tensile impact strength of both muscovite and phlogopite <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> improved when using silane and stearic acid. In non-surface treated systems, muscovite <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> showed an initial increase in elongation while the elongation of phlogopite <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> decreased with an increase in filler loading. Elongation at maximum load values, however, increased at low filler loadings, when using stearic acid.

40|$|The use of fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>composite</b> rods as {{concrete}} reinforcement material {{seems to}} be an effective solution to overcome durability problems of traditional steel reinforced concrete structures. The main advantages of fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>composite</b> materials over steel include the excellent corrosive resistance, mechanical properties similar to steel, high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent fatigue resistance, among others [Alsayed et al, 2000], [Lees, J. M., 2001]. Typically, fibre <b>reinforced</b> <b>composite</b> rods are produced by pultrusion, although, besides this technique, composite rods can also be produced using braiding techniques [Kadioglu, F. & Pidaparti, R. M., 2005], [Saikia, B. et al, 2005]. Braiding is a low cost technique that allows in-plane multiaxial orientation, conformability, excellent damage tolerance and core reinforcement [Soebroto et al, 1990], the production of ribbed structures and a wide range of mechanical properties may be improved when the core braided fabrics are reinforced with the appropriate type of fibres [Fangueiro et al, 2004, 2005 & 2006]. The current research work deals with the development of braided <b>reinforced</b> <b>composite</b> rods for civil engineering applications, namely to reinforce concrete structures as a substitute of steel rebars. The mechanical properties of composite rods, produced by braiding, are influenced by the type of fibre used as braided fabric core reinforcement, among other parameters. The objective of this experimental work is to evaluate the influence of the type of core reinforcement fibres on the mechanical performance of braided <b>reinforced</b> <b>composite</b> rods. Several samples of braided <b>reinforced</b> <b>composite</b> rods were produced using polyester fibres, for the production of braided fabrics, E-glass, carbon and HT polyethylene fibres, as braided fabrics core reinforcement, and polyester resin as polymeric matrix. Braided <b>reinforced</b> <b>composite</b> rods were produced on a vertical braiding machine incorporating an impregnation system specially developed for this purpose. Different braided <b>reinforced</b> <b>composite</b> rods were produced maintaining the braided fabric structure and varying the type of core reinforcement fibre. <b>Composite</b> rods were <b>reinforced</b> with a single type of reinforcement fibres as well as with two and three types of fibres, varying the percentage of each type. In order to evaluate the volume fraction of the different braided <b>reinforced</b> <b>composite</b> rods produced, tests were performed according to the Portuguese Standard NP 2216 / 1988 (determination of mass loss by calcinations of glass fibre reinforced plastics). In order to evaluate the mechanical performance of the different braided <b>reinforced</b> <b>composite</b> rods produced, tensile tests were carried out according to ASTM D 3916 - 94 standard, with a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. A post-load of 50 KN was applied to the rods prior to performing the tensile tests. When compared to the steel rebars currently used in the construction industry, composite rods higher tensile strength. Current steel rebars, A 235 NL, A 400 NR/ER and A 500 NR/ER have values of tensile strength of 360 MPa, 460 MPa, and 550 MPa respectively. Composite rods present tensile strength higher than 550 MPa.

The goals of the NASA Langley-sponsored research program are to demonstrate technology readiness with subscale composite components by 1995 and to verify the performance of full-scale composite primary aircraft structural components by 1997. The status of textile <b>reinforced</b> <b>composite</b> structural elements under development by Boeing, Douglas, Lockheed, and Grumman are presented. Included are braided frames and woven/stitched wing and fuselage panels...|$|R
40|$|The NASA LaRC is {{conducting}} and sponsoring research {{to explore the}} benefits of textile <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites</b> for civil transport aircraft primary structures. The objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate the potential of affordable textile <b>reinforced</b> <b>composite</b> materials to meet design properties and damage tolerance requirements of advanced aircraft structural concepts. In addition to in-house research, the program was recently expanded to include major participation by the aircraft industry and aerospace textile companies. The major program elements include development of textile preforms, processing science, mechanics of materials, experimental characterization of materials, and development and evaluation of textile <b>reinforced</b> <b>composite</b> structural elements and subcomponents. The NASA Langley in-house focus is as follows: development of a science-based understanding of resin transfer molding (RTM), development of powder-coated towpreg processes, analysis methodology, and development of a performance database on textile <b>reinforced</b> <b>composites.</b> The focus of the textile industry participation is on development of multidirectional, damage-tolerant preforms, and the aircraft industry participation is {{in the areas of}} design, fabrication and testing of textile <b>reinforced</b> <b>composite</b> structural elements and subcomponents. Textile processes such as 3 D weaving, 2 D and 3 D braiding, and knitting/stitching are being compared with conventional laminated tape processes for improved damage tolerance. Through-the-thickness reinforcements offer significant damage tolerance improvements. However, these gains must be weighed against potential loss in in-plane properties such as strength and stiffness.
