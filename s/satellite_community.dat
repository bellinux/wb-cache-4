5|$|With the {{development}} of the rail network, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen. In the 1870s and 1880s, the harbour was extended attracting industrial firms to the area. By the end of the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops. At the beginning of the 20th century, Roskilde first prospered as a <b>satellite</b> <b>community</b> for Copenhagen but then, as ships increased in size, suffered {{from the fact that the}} harbour was too small and Roskilde Fjord too shallow for navigation. Industries began to move out of the harbour area but were still the largest source of employment, thanks in part to the spirits factory (De Danske Spritfabrikker) and the slaughterhouse (Roskilde Andelssvineslagteri).|$|E

Three families moved there to produce copra for sale and other families rotated living there later on. Their homes on both Kili and Jaluit were struck by typhoons during 1957 and 1958, sinking their supply ship and damaging crops.|$|E
2500|$|Developed as an {{innovative}} [...] "new town", Bramalea was constructed approximately 40kilometres northwest of Toronto. Located {{in the former}} Chinguacousy Township, it was Canada's first <b>satellite</b> <b>community</b> developed {{by one of the}} country's largest real estate developers, Bramalea Limited. The name [...] "Bramalea" [...] was created by the farmer William Sheard, who combined [...] "BRAM" [...] from Brampton, [...] "MAL" [...] from Malton (then a neighbouring town which is now part of the city of Mississauga), and [...] "LEA", an Old English word meaning meadow or grassland. [...] He sold the land to Brampton Leasing (the former name of the developer) and built one of Bramalea's first houses on Dixie Road.|$|E
2500|$|Underground {{coal mines}} were dug [...] {{away from the}} {{townsite}} in the narrow Coal Creek valley and until 1960 a small <b>satellite</b> <b>community</b> known as Coal Creek stood adjacent to them. A variety of other mines were sunk into the coal fields in a fifty-kilometer radius in the following two decades. No mining was ever carried out in Fernie proper; coking of Coal Creek coal was carried out at the townsite, but otherwise the town developed into an administrative and commercial centre for the burgeoning industry. Forestry played a smaller role in the local economy and a local brewery produced Fernie Beer from Brewery Creek (mountain spring water).|$|E

25|$|The Jarabarriu, {{the final}} stage of the Chavín Horizon, lasted from about 400 to 250 BCE. Chavín culture had a {{dramatic}} increase in population. The settlement pattern changed to a proto-urban pattern, consisting of a center of lowland valley peoples and smaller <b>satellite</b> <b>communities</b> in the surrounding higher altitude areas. The culture showed specialization and social differentiation. The people who lived in the east at Chavín de Huantar are thought to have had lower prestige than the communities around the ceremonial center. A diverse and intense production of ceramics is suggested during the Jarabarriu phase, when the valley was heavily populated and the ceramic style more defined. <b>Satellite</b> <b>communities</b> also developed centers of production during this phase.|$|R
