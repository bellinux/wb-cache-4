The impossibility to access the services provided by these technologies creates a <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> that reduces the self-suficiency of disabled individuals and causes social isolation, which in turn diminishes their overall quality of life. Considering the importance of these technologies and services in our society, we have developed a pictogram-based Instant Messaging service for individuals with cognitive disabilities who have reading and writing problems. Along the paper we introduce and discuss the User Centred Design methodology that we have used to develop and evaluate the pictogram-based Instant Messaging service and client with individuals with cognitive disabilities taking into account their communication and usability requirements. From the results obtained in the evaluation process we can state that individuals with cognitive disabilities have been able to use the pictogram-based Instant Messaging service and client to communicate with their relatives and acquaintances, thus serving as a tool to help reducing their social and digital exclusion situation...|$|E

This article is based on a recent research carried out to explore the impact of education on sex {{workers and their}} children?s lives by gathering evidence on social exclusion and child abuse or protection {{in the context of their}} lives. The study focused on how education could be a vehicle for them to break the vicious cycle of exploitation. This was a mixed method interpretative study which employed qualitative and quantitative approaches. Quantitative data was generated through a questionnaire and qualitative data was generated through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Data was collected from different research participants such as sex workers, sex workers' children, teachers of sex workers? children and NGO workers working in the research site. Thematic and descriptive statistics were used for data analysis to understand the challenges and barriers faced by sex workers and their children in their educational aspirations. The life of sex workers and their children is marginalised by the mainstream society. Though it is very difficult to break the vicious cycle of exploitation, education may be a stepping stone for them to create a better future. However, sex workers and their children need income generating vocational and technical education to earn and support their family.

40|$|Abstract The fast {{developing}} technologies {{can benefit}} disabled people from many ways. However, it also formed new gap {{to them and}} caused their lives to be marginalized by the digital society. The purpose {{of this research was}} to find out issues and problems disabled people meet in the e-Society. A literature study was conducted as the research method by trying to follow the principles of systematic literature review method. 51 articles were collected from the online publication database to support this research. The results found out that the reasons caused the exclusion of disabled people are because of the issues of affordability, impairments of disabled people and social phenomenon. The price of mainstream technologies in the market is not affordable to the majority number of disabled people since the low employment rate and low income level keep most of them living in poverty. On one hand, the impairments of disabled people not only affect their lives and works, but also limited their ability to have the access to various technologies. On the other hand, the design of technologies has not fully covered the needs of disabled users, which causes many challenges and problems during the experiment of technologies. Moreover, due to the average low level of education, disabled people are lacking of technical knowledge in how to use ICT, especially in the group of female and senior people with disabilities. The most important finding in this research paper demonstrates {{that more than half of}} the articles mentioned the issue of lacking awareness in disabled people. The <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> of disabled people in today’s digital world can be changed if the whole society could pay more attention to their challenges and problems...|$|E

A model open enough to give space to differences but coherent enough to provide the idea of integration. I will call this figuration (theoretical model) Urdimbre. This model represent the metaphorical image of a theoretical support for Hispanic American women writings, composed by three main concepts or epistemologies: the rhizome (Deleuze and Guattari), the analogous-metaphorical method (Lezama Lima) and the idea of semantic constellations (from different authors and fields). The integration of this theoretical approaches will create a complex and flexible structure that can be able to include and be expand and also open to changes and dialogues.

40|$|Background: This {{theoretical}} paper uses {{results from}} {{a recent study of}} the occupation of breastfeeding to create a practical scenario illustrating how lack of access to paid family medical leave in the United States contributes to disparities in family health and exclusion from participation in early family occupations such as breastfeeding (1). The Life Course Health Development (LCHD) framework a theoretical framework examining contexts of health disparities (2), is introduced as a relevant and useful lens for examining social determinants of family health and occupation. In the United States, the lack of paid family leave from employment is a social policy barrier that deprives families from health producing early family occupations. Factors such as lower levels of education and income, associated with risk of not breastfeeding, are also associated with having employment that does not afford family leave or other flexible work characteristics (3). These factors interact to create a nested environment of early adversity for families, who in addition to being deprived of participation in the health producing occupation of breastfeeding, also experience parent-infant separation and exclusion from other early family occupations. Complex social determinants interact to create early adversity for families leading to a trajectory of decreased occupational potential and poor family health across the life course (4). Thinking about occupation often underemphasizes the influence of social determinants, such as alienating social policies, on occupation across the life course. Recognizing and understanding how social determinants create barriers to occupational participation and performance will help inform occupational science and client-centered occupational therapy practice (5). Aim/Objectives: The aim {{of this paper is to}} critically examine gaps in thinking about social determinants of occupation and demonstrate how the complex interplay between social determinants, including social policy, may lead to injustices in occupational participation and performance. Methods: A practical scenario illustrating social determinants of breastfeeding was constructed using results from bivariate and multivariate analysis of contextual factors associated with extended, exclusive breastfeeding. Factors from the Infant Feeding and Practices Study II (IFPS II), a study described elsewhere, were mapped to the most appropriate LCHD context and used to create a scenario depicting the nested environment of disparity in family health and occupation resulting from lack of access to family medical leave. Results: The LCHD framework is a useful lens for examining social determinants of occupation and identifying how lack of access to family leave creates a <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> from breastfeeding and occupational injustice. Conclusion and Significance: Expanding thinking about social determinants of early family occupation to include understanding of how social policy may alienate or exclude families from occupations such as breastfeeding may enhance therapist-client interactions and outcomes of the occupational therapy process, and address gaps in current thinking that may contribute to occupational injustices.

Building on the approach-inhibition theory of power (Keltner, Gruenfeld, 2 ̆ 6 Anderson, 2003), we examined the role of power in facilitating social connection following exclusion. Four experiments found that following exclusion, high power (relative to low power) individuals intend to socially connect more with others. Specifically, following exclusion, individuals primed with high power sought new social connections more than those primed with low power (Studies 1 – 4) or those receiving no power prime (Study 1). The intention to seek social connection as a function of power was limited to <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion,</b> as it did not occur when individuals were included (Studies 3 and 4).

O {{material}} consultado foi levantado por meio de revisão bibliográfica em bases de dados da área da saúde. Já as informações sobre as diretrizes brasileiras foram coletadas nas publicações oficiais disponibilizadas on-line pelo Ministério da Saúde e Ministério do Trabalho e do Emprego do Brasil. A análise do material permitiu-nos verificar que a reabilitação vocacional praticada em países da América do Norte e da Europa destina-se a usuários de serviços de saúde mental, procedendo à inclusão pelo viés da doença. Enfatiza a recolocação no mercado formal de trabalho, por meio de programas voltados ao treinamento de habilidades para obter e manter um posto de trabalho conquistado. Já as diretrizes do governo brasileiro estão pautadas nos princípios do cooperativismo e da economia solidária. Privilegia o ser humano como sujeito e finalidade maior da atividade econômica, focalizando as potencialidades e recursos do trabalho, em detrimento das limitações impostas pela doença ou pela condição socioeconômica que tenha gerado a situação de exclusão. This paper {{contributes to}} {{the debate on the}} potencial of work in the recovery process of addicts. The vocational rehabilitation principles are analyzed and compared to the Brazilian guidelines for the work rehabilitation of this population. In this analysis we compare the underlying concept of health and the emancipatory potential in both perspectives. The literature on vocational rehabilitation was raised through a literature review on Medline, Pubmed and Lilacs, with the following key words: vocational rehabilitation, substance abuse treatment & work. The Brazilian Government guidelines were collected in the official publications available online by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Labour and Employment of Brazil. The analysis of the material pointed out that the vocational rehabilitation practiced in North America and Europe focus on users of mental health services, proceeding to the work inclusion through the bias of the disease. The vocational rehabilitation emphasizes the replacement in the formal labor market, through programs aimed at skills training to get and keep a job. On the other hand, the Brazilian public policies are guided by the principles of cooperative and social economy.

40|$|Esta pesquisa apresentou como ponto de partida questões concernentes às intervenções sociais {{realizadas}} com meninos e meninas que vivem em situação de rua. A situação de exclusão vivenciada por esta população, levou-nos a refletir sobre os diferentes atores sociais que interferem nesta dinâmica. Dentre eles, atentamo-nos às práticas das Organizações Não Governamentais (ONGs) fundadas a partir de 1990. Transitamos pelo significado de ONG, seu discurso e propostas junto às crianças e jovens, a partir do olhar de seus profissionais. Atualmente a sigla ONG pouco revela, recheia-se de ambigüidade. São inúmeras as instituições que se auto-intitulam não governamentais, apresentado propostas muito diversas e, inclusive, antagônicas. Ao se instituírem como personalidade jurídica, as ONGs adotam uma política de parcerias com o Estado e/ou empresas do setor privado lucrativo. Algumas delas procuram desenvolver um trabalho de assessoria junto aos movimentos populares; outras desenvolvem um perfil de filantropia empresarial e se integram no bojo das relações sociais alinhadas com a proposta neoliberal de reestruturação do capitalismo, em detrimento da formação política. Ao procurarmos compreender a consistência entre o discurso e a prática destas ONGs - aqui chamadas de ONGs empresariais - percebemos seu entretecimento a partir de um modelo fechado de gestão do conhecimento. Procura-se controlar e gerir o conhecimento, impedindo-se o livre fluxo das idéias, a razão livre, o pensamento criador e dialético. A tentativa de controle do conhecimento limita o entendimento das contradições e complexidades da realidade social, resultando em atitudes que geram o distanciamento do jovem e causando sofrimento para o profissional. As empresas e ONGs empresariais incorporam o discurso socialista destituindo-lhe a história, limitando-o a uma franquia de conceitos. Assim a crítica se uniformiza, torna-se homogênea perdendo-se entre a falácia e as ações institucionaisThis research firstly introduced {{problems associated}} with social interventions that concerned the street children. The <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> this population undergoes took us to consider the different social actors that interfere into this reality. As a second step, we focused on the practices held by Non-Governamental Organizations (NGOs) founded during the 1990 s, as we heard their professionals. Therefore we unveiled the meanings suggested by the term NGO, considering both the speeches and proposals which regarded {{the children and the}} Young. Nowadays the term NGO doens t reveal much about these organizations. It sounds confusing and ambiguous. There are many institutions which call themselves non-governamental. Not only do they hold different proposals, but they also sound controversial. As the NGOs settle themselves as legal institutions, they maintain partnership policies with the Estate and/or private enterprises. Some NGOs focus their work on counselling popular movements; some others enact the profile of business philanthropy, as they join the social context aligned with the neoliberal project under the logic of capitalism to the detriment of a political background. As we attempt for the consistency between the speeches and practices held by the NGOs conjoined to enterprises, we notice the unveiling of a self-centered model of knowledge management. There is a need for controlling knowledge and it forbides the flowing of ideas, the freedom of thought in its creative and dialectic flux. The attempt for controlling knowledge imposes a limit for understanding the contradictions and complexities upraised from social relations. As a result, the professionals suffer, the projects drawn {{for the benefit of the}} Young keep them further and further from the institutions. As some enterprises and NGOs incorporate the socialist speech, they disregard history and delimit the speech into a franchise of concepts. Hence, critics are expressed into a homogeneous shape and loses conherence between the institutional practices and its proposal...|$|E

Design/methodology: We collected and analyzed evidences provided by different participants in {{learning communities}} that have {{students with special needs}} among their student body. Both data collection and analysis were based on the communicative methodology of research, which has as main aim to identify the transformative components of social and educational realities that contribute to overcome <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion.</b> Findings: Results show that learning communities promote the inclusion of students with disabilities in terms of participation in shared activities, acceptance within the group and increase of learning opportunities. When these students are not separated based on their abilities and the existing resources, both within and outside the school, are reorganized in order to educate all students in heterogeneous groups, high learning expectations are promoted and these students can benefit from the aforementioned results. Originality/value: Learning communities are a project for schools transformation which entails a better use of the multiple and diverse human resources already available in the community, in order to maximize learning opportunities for all students, which in turn benefits students with special needs. In this way, these schools overcome approaches to diversity management mainly based on individualized supports, in order to respond to diversity of needs based on the global transformation of the school. </p...|$|R

The observations were also conducted in Luleå, a preschool where both preschool teachers and childcare workers are employed, the children were aged 3 - 5 years. We have chosen to specifically focus on harmony and conflict perspective as our basis for the study, and one that pervades our work. Our results have shown that preschool teachers are against exclusions in kindergarten and believe that it should not occur. But we have noted that preschool teachers and educators are not particularly active in the children's play, that could lead to exclusions and that the teachers miss important learning activities for the children. Preschool teachers believe that it is sometimes legitimate to exclude children from the game, if they destroy for the other children.

For over a decade, {{debates in}} {{occupational}} therapy have extended into the profession's theoretical foundations {{as well as}} epistemological underpinnings thereof A series of proposals have emerged {{from around the world}} that aim to link the definition of occupational therapy, its knowledge and practices to contemporary social, political, cultural and economic conditions. Contributing to this is the increasing precariousness of the global social life, the economic crises of many social systems, and the deterioration of the ecological environment. The current paper critically reflects on the historical conditions that shape the institution of occupational therapy, particularly in the regions of South America and Africa. This involves a political, ethical, and epistemological rethinking of the foundations that underpin identities, knowledge and practices of occupational therapy and their effects on society. These foundations may favour processes <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> and ahistorical and individualist views of human occupation, as opposed to social perspectives expressed in collective occupations and human rights promoting practices. The authors propose to problematise the construction of a professional identity, knowledge and practices of occupational therapy, emphasising the need for a liberating discipline, committed to and acting alongside people and communities who are in <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion.</b> This implies the necessary positioning of occupational therapy within social transformation.

3000|$|As {{these authors}} summarize, MD {{patients}} have gone “from a <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> passive <b>exclusion</b> to one <b>of</b> active inclusion” (ibid.: 235), not least {{with the support}} of biomedical, genetic research. More specifically, the AFM in its overall strategy followed both a “path to cure” and a “path to citizenship”; on the path to cure, it adopted a “genetic identity” which helped it to engage in biomedical research and which finally could be transformed into a “genetic citizenship” (idid.: 236). In another paper, the authors even ascribe a “civilizing” effect to “the gene” (understood as an “actant” in the actor-network-theory terminology) (Callon and Rabeharisoa 2003 : 201): “By showing that a defect is in fact a small genetic accident, the AFM demonstrates that we are all just one or two genes away from being MD patients. Genes are not content just to make particular and general interests compatible; they also produce solidarity and compassion.” (Ibid.: 200). 8 [...]...|$|R

The research focused on different configurations, beliefs, representations, and forms of social organization of behavior thought {{to be associated with the}} population's capacity to efficiently follow AIDS prevention measures. Participants located in neighborhoods known for having large migrant populations were identified by Family Health Program Workers in Fortaleza and Teresina. The study adopted a qualitative methodology. Several belief-system concepts and values, as well as the social organization of sexuality revealed in the study, represent obstacles both to AIDS prevention and condom use. Hunger, lack of prospects, and fear are associated with a social <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> poverty, <b>exclusion,</b> prejudice, and total absence of basic human rights When examined together, these elements define different configurations in the migrants' increased vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. The groups' increased vulnerability relates to the socioeconomic complexity that must be considered in HIV/AIDS control and prevention programs...|$|R
40|$|Results from a 4 -year ARC-funded {{research}} project (LP 110200440, led by Rennie 1) reveal how the current Universal Service Obligation (USO) is {{failing to meet}} the needs of Indigenous Australians living in remote communities. The consumer preferences of this group differ significantly from other groups, leading to a <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> digital <b>exclusion</b> in areas without mobile reception. Current regulatory measures designed to protect basic access to telecommunications are in fact working to restrict new retail offerings from emerging. We contend that Australia's USO requires adjustment in order to enable the emergence of new services that fit minority group preferences. Subsidy auctions, together with changes to the definition of services provided under the USO are a possible solution, and likely to be achievable within the terms of Telstra's current 20 -year USO contract. In the final section of this submission we provide international examples of the kinds of services that might arise under our proposed changes...|$|R
30|$|While the {{constraint}} that irregular {{legal status}} places on physical circulation between destination and origin is unambiguous, the legal constraint of this status on other transnational activities is less clear. Why would, for instance, irregular legal status constrain remittances, a transnational activity {{that does not}} necessarily involve the migrant’s physical crossing of a border? The literature suggests a mechanism: migrants with an irregular status are in a <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> structural <b>exclusion,</b> which, in turn, blocks their ability to perform cross-border activities (Bloch, 2008; Mazzucato, 2008; Van Meeteren, 2012). Lack of regular legal status can, for example, prevent migrants from participating in the formal labor market, relegating them to informal, precarious, and low-paid jobs; this insecurity could make them {{less likely to have}} the means to remit. Lack of regular legal status could also constrain participation in various financial institutions: not having a bank account or not being able to access credit could reduce migrants’ abilities to send remittances to and invest in assets at home, for example. We thus hypothesize a mechanism of blocked transnationalism that would manifest itself by a direct negative effect of irregular legal statuses on remitting because <b>of</b> the structural <b>exclusion</b> it engenders.|$|R
40|$|Social {{exclusion}} {{has been}} brought to the forefront of media attention in recent years due to the recent tragedies like campus shootings and cyberbullying on social networking websites. In order to gain a deeper understanding <b>of</b> social <b>exclusion,</b> this study examined the relation between social exclusion and event-related brain potential (ERP) activity. ERPs were collected while participants completed three blocks of the Cyberball paradigm during which they experienced <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> social inclusion, <b>exclusion,</b> and re-inclusion. This well-established paradigm mimics actual social behavior experienced in real-world situations. Results showed larger N 2 and smaller P 3 amplitudes during throws where participants were excluded compared to when they were included, regardless of the interaction’s overall context (inclusion, exclusion, re-inclusion), suggesting the conflict-driven “neural alarm” and the allocation of attention are determined more by specific events within the interaction rather than the larger context of the social exchange. Further, during the exclusionary interaction, both the N 2 and P 3 showed larger amplitudes in the earlier stages <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> compared to the later stages, suggesting heightened early sensitivity for both components, and P 3 amplitude was larger to exclusionary events compared to the two inclusionary interactions, indicating a contextual influence <b>of</b> <b>exclusion.</b> These findings suggest that discrete events occurring during a social interaction may provide additional insights into social exclusion compared to more global “inclusionary” or “exclusionary” classifications of social interactions...|$|R
