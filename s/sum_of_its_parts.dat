5|$|Paley's Natural Theology is an {{extended}} argument, constructed around {{a series of}} examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; {{and the existence of}} finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like hinges or manmade ball and socket joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that a system is more than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial.|$|E
25|$|The G8 summits {{during the}} 21st century have {{inspired}} widespread debates, protests and demonstrations; and the two- or three-day event becomes {{more than the}} <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> elevating the participants, the issues and the venue as focal points for activist pressure.|$|E

We know how to bludgeon that to death, so we’ve spent decades exploring other territories and {{finding new ways to}} be heavy and new ways to integrate the things we love about music—harmony, dissonance, and the way they interplay, and distortion and beauty and how they intertwine. Then we try to weave it all together into some tapestry that becomes bigger than the simple <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> and becomes transcendent.|$|R
25|$|The {{value of}} asset-based {{analysis}} of a business {{is equal to the}} <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> That is the theory underlying the asset-based approaches to business valuation. The asset approach to business valuation reported on the books of the subject company at their acquisition value, net of depreciation where applicable. These values must be adjusted to fair market value wherever possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} reduce {{everything}} to simple fundamental laws {{does not imply}} the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe. The constructionist hypothesis breaks down when confronted with the twin difficulties of scale and complexity. At each level of complexity entirely new properties appear. Psychology is not applied biology, nor is biology applied chemistry. We can now see that the whole becomes not merely more, but {{very different from the}} <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gloucestershire {{was very}} {{successful}} in one-day cricket in the late 1990s and early 2000s winning several titles under the captaincy of Mark Alleyne and coaching of John Bracewell. The club operated on a small budget and was famed as a team greater than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> boasting few international stars. Gloucestershire's overall knockout record between 1999 and 2002 was 28 wins and seven losses from 37 games, including 16 wins from 18 at the Bristol County Ground.|$|E
50|$|The strategy's basis {{was that}} the {{collective}} expertise of the whole of UCL {{is greater than the}} <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> subject-specific <b>parts.</b> By collaborating across disciplines, therefore, the university could address major problems most effectively.|$|R

25|$|Lawler {{developed}} her individual style {{during the}} early 1980s, a time of intense growth in the overall economy and in the art market. In 1981 Lawler had her first West Coast gallery solo exhibition at Jancar Kuhlenschmidt Gallery in Los Angeles. In 1982, for her first solo exhibition at Metro Pictures, Lawler showed a small suite of artworks pulled from the gallery’s stockroom. The pieces were to be sold together, as a single work called Arranged by Louise Lawler, and it was priced at the literal <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> plus an extra 10 percent commission for Lawler; the piece did not sell.|$|E
25|$|On 12 September 2012 it was {{reported}} that BAE and EADS were in discussions regarding a possible merger. In the event of the merger, BAE shareholders would own 40% and EADS 60% of the new enlarged organisation. A key French EADS shareholder Lagardere asked EADS to rethink the proposed merger plan as the conditions were unsatisfactory. The bosses of BAE Systems and EADS issued a joint statement seeking political support for their proposed 35 billion euro (US$45 billion) merger from the British, French and German governments; and reiterated that the combination is borne out of opportunity, not necessity and the new company would be greater than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> It {{was reported}} on 10 October 2012, that the merger between BAE Systems and EADS had been called off.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that two {{converging}} bimodal stimuli can produce a perception that is not only different in magnitude than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> but also quite different in quality. In a classic study labeled the McGurk effect, a person's phoneme production was dubbed with a video of that person speaking a different phoneme. The end result was the perception of a third, different phoneme. McGurk and MacDonald (1976) explained that phonemes such as ba, da, ka, ta, ga and pa can be divided into four groups, those that can be visually confused, i.e. (da, ga, ka, ta) and (ba and pa), and those that can be audibly confused. Hence, when ba – voice and ga lips are processed together, the visual modality sees ga or da, and the auditory modality hears ba or da, combining to form the percept da.|$|E

5000|$|In mathematics, a {{continued}} fraction {{is an expression}} obtained through an iterative process of representing a number as the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> integer <b>part</b> and the reciprocal of another number, then writing this other number as the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> integer <b>part</b> and another reciprocal, and so on. In a finite continued fraction (or terminated continued fraction), the iteration/recursion is terminated after finitely many steps by using an integer in lieu of another continued fraction. In contrast, an infinite continued fraction is an infinite expression. In either case, all integers in the sequence, other than the first, must be positive. The integers [...] are called the coefficients or terms of the continued fraction.|$|R
40|$|The {{author of}} some 10 or 12 {{performed}} plays gives {{some thoughts on}} {{how to write a}} scene in a play. All elements of a play, character, action and so on, are in a scene. Scene, rather than act, is (as ancient writers have it, including Shakespeare) the most basic element in a play. The author describes how a scene {{can be seen as a}} 2 ̆ 2 reaction 2 ̆ 2 to things going on in the world, especially the various relationships between people. An analogy is given to things arranged as a 2 ̆ 2 heap 2 ̆ 2 to a unity [...] -an emergent, something more than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>part...</b>|$|R
500|$|Durkheim {{sought to}} create {{one of the first}} {{rigorous}} scientific approaches to social phenomena. Along with Herbert Spencer, {{he was one of the}} first people to explain the existence and quality of different parts of a society by reference to what function they served in maintaining the quotidian (i.e. by how they make society [...] "work"). He also agreed with Spencer's organic analogy, comparing society to a living organism. Thus his work is sometimes seen as a precursor to functionalism. Durkheim also insisted that society was more than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Mass Effect {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from video game publications. The game's interactive storytelling and cinematic design were highlighted very positively, while the combat and vehicle navigation were generally {{seen as the}} game's weakest features. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot described Mass Effect as [...] "a great game with moments of brilliance {{and a number of}} small but significant obstacles that hold it back from reaching its true potential." [...] Similarly, IGN's Erik Brudvig considered it greater than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> stating that although Mass Effect features numerous technical issues, most of the game [...] "is so expertly delivered that it can transcend its weaknesses." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 2011, [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] {{was voted}} number 25 on MTV's 25 Best Songs of 2011. James Montgomery wrote that the song was a [...] "supremely {{saccharine}} single from erstwhile Girls Aloud member mashes together every notable pop moment in recent history, yet somehow manages to be better that the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> That's thanks mostly to the supercharged, sing-a-long chorus, where the whole thing comes together in a head-spinning rush. She should go solo more often." [...] The song was also listed on Billboard magazine's Best Songs of 2011 list at number 14. [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] was listed as The Guardians 14th best song.|$|E

50|$|Holism {{in general}} {{is the idea that}} all the {{properties}} of a given system in any field of study cannot be determined or explained by the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> component <b>parts.</b> Instead, the system as a whole determines how <b>its</b> <b>parts</b> behave. A holistic way of thinking tries to encompass and integrate multiple layers of meaning and experience rather than defining human possibilities narrowly.|$|R
5000|$|A {{composite}} film is {{a feature}} film whose screenplay is composed {{of two or more}} distinct stories. More generally, composite structure refers to an aesthetic principle in which the narrative structure relies on contiguity and linking rather than linearity. In a composite text or film, individual pieces are complete within themselves, yet they form a whole work that is greater than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> individual <b>parts.</b>|$|R
500|$|... "Since I Left You" [...] {{received}} widespread critical acclaim. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine {{gave the}} song a positive review, praising it for [...] "allow the sampled performances to truly glisten."

500|$|Solomon Eliot Asch (September 14, 1907 – February 20, 1996) was a Polish gestalt {{psychologist}} and pioneer in social psychology in the United States. He created seminal pieces {{of work in}} impression formation, prestige suggestion, conformity, and many other topics in social psychology. [...] His work follows a common theme of Gestalt psychology that the whole is not only greater than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> but {{the nature of the}} whole fundamentally alters the parts. Asch stated: [...] "Most social acts have to be understood in their setting, and lose meaning if isolated. No error in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function" [...] (Asch, 1952, p.61). He is most well known for his conformity experiments, in which he demonstrated the influence of group pressure on opinions. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Asch as the 41st most cited psychologist of the 20th century.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of 30 Rock was {{reviewed}} favorably by critics. Metacritic gave the pilot episode a Metascore—a weighted average {{based on the}} impressions of a select thirty-one critical reviews—of 67 out of 100. Robert Abele of LA Weekly declared that the show was a [...] "weirdly appropriate and hilarious symbol of our times". The Wall Street Journals Dorothy Rabinowitz wrote that the [...] "standard caution is relevant—debut episodes tend to be highly polished. All {{the more reason to}} enjoy the hilarious scenes and fine ensemble cast here". Some less favorable reviews were received from Brian Lowry of Variety. Lowry said, [...] "Despite her success with Mean Girls, [...] Fey mostly hits too-familiar notes in the pilot. Moreover, she's a limited protagonist, which is problematic." [...] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune criticized [...] "30Rock for being less than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts,</b> and, as an entry in the single-camera comedy sweepstakes, it fails to show either the inspired inventiveness of Arrested Development or provide the surprisingly perceptive character studies of The Office".|$|E
50|$|When viewed holistically, a {{group is}} greater than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> {{individual}} <b>parts.</b> When people speak of groups, they speak of the group as a whole, or an entity, rather than speaking of it in terms of individuals.

40|$|A more {{engaging}} and visionary role for architects is emerging, altering focus from a technological advisor {{to a more}} sociological engineer or entrepreneur. By researching a selection of current architectural practices an attempt is made to describe this evolution of the architect’s role and to assess if this is truly a new development or even a paradigm shift. Based upon on an analysis of texts by scholars and written conversations with architects {{on the subject of}} sustainable architecture, resilient architecture, agency in architecture and reactivist architecture, supplemented with additional statements by architects on the matter of architectural practice, an evolution of this role made clear and put into perspective. The aim of this review therefore is to distil some kind consensus within architectural practice of how the architect’s role is to evolve in the foreseeable future. It appears that reactivist architecture as a descriptive set of principles has absorbed elements of all of the above, becoming more than the <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts</b> and allowing for a new role for the architect to emerge. </p...|$|R
500|$|On {{the night}} before the 15 January 1987 {{deadline}} set by Island Records to complete the record, the band and the crew completed mixing. As they worked at Melbeach, Lillywhite's wife, singer Kirsty MacColl, volunteered to set the running order for the album. The band told her to put [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] first and [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] last, with the rest sequenced according to her preference. Bono said of MacColl's contribution, [...] "Your hope for your album is that it will always be greater than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> It wasn't happening for The Joshua Tree and she came in and she organized it and it worked as an old-fashioned album: a beginning, middle and end." [...] Around 2 AM, just seven hours before the album was due to Island for mastering, the Edge tried to convince Lillywhite to allow him to add backing vocals to [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name", but he was refused. In the morning, Meegan and Lillywhite flew with the album's tapes to Island's offices in Hammersmith, London.|$|E
500|$|However, Internet {{film critic}} James Berardinelli, {{in spite of}} {{awarding}} it {{two and a half}} stars out of four, gave the film a somewhat scathing review. On his website, Berardinelli wrote that [...] "Meet the Parents is put together like a TV sit-com," [...] that Roach [...] "strings together a series of hit-and-miss lowbrow gags with little care for whether any of the connecting material is coherent, interesting, or enjoyable (in most cases, it's none of those three)" [...] and concluding that [...] "even with Stiller and De Niro, Meet the Parents is an encounter that can be postponed until it's available on video." [...] Jeff Vice of the Deseret News, another detractor of the film, proclaimed Meet the Parents [...] "only erratically funny" [...] and accused Roach of taking [...] "the cheap way out with a series of unfunny jokes." [...] Critic Peter Bradshaw's review of the film in The Guardian concludes that Meet the Parents [...] "is somehow less than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> It strains to come to life, but never quite makes it." [...] After the film was released on home media, DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone magazine contributor Douglas Pratt in his book Doug Pratt's DVD: Movies, Television, Music, Art, Adult, and More! stated that [...] "perhaps in the crowded theater the film is hysterical, but in the quieter venue of home video, it just seems sadistic, and as the humor evaporates, the holes in the plot become clearer." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Call of the Simpsons" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, both criticized and praised the episode saying: [...] "This episode is a bit less than the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>parts.</b> The early stuff at the RV Round-Up is much better than the main camping story, although there's some nice Marge-Lisa bonding, and who could resist Maggie and the bears?" [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 1.5/5, adding [...] "the surrealism of Homer as bigfoot is a major misstep. This type of gag would be very different today, if done at all." [...] Jon Bonné at MSNBC called the episode [...] "a perfect example of the first season’s bizarre and fruitful balance between edgy humor and softly-drawn neuroses" [...] and stated that [...] "it was this combination that made Groening’s shorts for the Ullman show so compelling, and ultimately what made it possible for The Simpsons to break the molds of network television." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that [...] "while [...] doesn’t offer the continuous highs of the best Simpsons, it’s a generally solid show" [...] and added that [...] "the episode uses a wackier tone than usual for this era, but it works, and the program is consistently fun".|$|E
