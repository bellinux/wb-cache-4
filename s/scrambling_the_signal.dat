Thus, we used a 1 D chaotic scrambler and a permutation scheme to achieve integrated ECG/EEG visual encryption. One way for realizing the visual encryption mechanism is to <b>scramble</b> <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> values of <b>the</b> input integrated ECG/EEG signal by multiplying a 1 D chaotic <b>signal</b> to randomize <b>the</b> ECG/EEG <b>signal</b> values, and then a chaotic address scanning order encryption is applied to the randomize reference values.

In this paper, several theorems on the stability of impulsive control systems are presented. These theorems are then used to find {{the conditions under which}} the chaotic systems can be asymptotically controlled to the origin by using impulsive control. Given the parameters of the chaotic system and the impulsive control law, an estimation of the upper bound of the impulse interval is given. We also present a theory of impulsive synchronization of two chaotic systems. A promising application of impulsive synchronization of chaotic systems to a secure communication scheme is presented.

To separate ballistic light containing information on a hidden object from multiscattered light coming from the surrounding environment that <b>scrambles</b> <b>the</b> <b>signal,</b> an optical Kerr gate can be used. It consists of a carbon disulfide (CS(2)) cell in which birefringence is optically induced. An imaging beam passes through the studied medium while a pump pulse is used to open the gate. The time-delayed scattered light is excluded from measurements by the gate, and <b>the</b> multiple-scattering <b>scrambling</b> effect is reduced. In previous works, the two beams had the same wavelength. We propose a new two-color experimental setup for ballistic imaging in which a second harmonic is generated and used for the image, while the fundamental is used for gate switching. This setup allows one to obtain better resolution by using a spectral filtering to eliminate noise from the pump pulse, instead of a spatial filtering.

In the acquisition mode, a code-multiplexed pilot is used to adapt the equalizer from cold start or loss-of-lock. The use of MAI filtering results in a third-order least mean squares (LMS) algorithm, which has significant advantages over standard (i. e., first-order) LMS in nonstationary environments.
