Purpose of the work: prolongation {{of the service}} life of radial-contact seals by technological methods {{on the basis of}} determination of the qualitative characteristics of surfaces of the worked parts with the operating characteristics of the <b>sealing</b> <b>assembly.</b> Theoretical results: determination of the analytical and empirical dependences between the geometrical parameters of micro-irregularities and the conditions of appearance of a hydrodynamic effect in the contact zone, development of a kinematic scheme and a method of surface working for installation of radial-contact seals. Practical results: reduction of the needs in spare parts (collars, flanges, shafts), reduction of the downtime caused by repair of <b>sealing</b> <b>assemblies,</b> prolongation of the service life of a <b>sealing</b> <b>assembly</b> 1, 5 == 2 times.

40|$|The <b>sealing</b> <b>assembly</b> for a port of a valve or {{the like}} is disclosed. In detail, the <b>sealing</b> <b>assembly</b> {{includes}} the port having a circular shaped end with a circular shaped knife-edge thereon. The <b>sealing</b> <b>assembly</b> further includes a hollow cap having a closed first end with an aperture therethrough and an open second end. The cap further includes internal threads adapted to mate with the external threads of the port. A gasket is mounted within the cap having flat first and second principle sides and made of a deformable metal, the first principle side of the gasket for mounting against the circular shaped knife edge of the port. A plunger having a circular shaped disc portion is adapted to fit within the hollow cap and is engagable with the first principle surface of the gasket and includes a shaft portion extending out of the aperture. The cap and shaft of the plunger include external wrenching flats. Thus when the cap is screwed onto the port and the plunger is prevented from rotating by a wrench mounted on the wrenching flats of the shaft portion of the plunger, the gasket is forced into engagement with the knife edge in pure compression and no rotation of the gasket occurs causing the knife edge to locally deform the gasket sealing of the port...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this {{memorandum}} is to inform the Standardized Plant Analysis Risk (SPAR) model users and other agency risk analysts {{about the implications of}} using the “Rhodes Model” to model reactor coolant pump (RCP) seal loss-of-coolant accidents (LOCAs). The SPAR models are used in analyses that support regulatory activities, such as: (1) the Significance Determination Process (SDP) in the Reactor Oversight Process, (2) enforcement actions which are based on risk significance, (3) risk-informed reviews of license amendments, and (4) the Accident Sequence Precursor (ASP) Program. We are providing this information because the Rhodes Model is different from the RCP seal LOCA model incorporated in the SPAR models at the present time. For Westinghouse RCP <b>seal</b> <b>assemblies,</b> the SPAR models use RCP seal LOCA models developed to support NUREG- 1150 “Severe Accident Risks: An Assessment for Five U. S.

50|$|Compressed gas {{enters the}} valve of the Phantom, {{pressing}} the cup <b>seal</b> <b>assembly</b> against the retainer with the aide of the valve spring. This gas forces the valve to stay sealed {{and allows the}} gun to be cocked which prepares the hammer of the paintball marker for firing. Without {{the pressure of the}} gas in the valve the gun cannot be cocked. As indicated by the term pump action the first step in firing the marker is the pump stroke which uses the rod connecting the pump handle and bolt to cock the marker. The pump stroke consists of two parts; the backward pump stroke and the forward pump stroke. On the backward pump stroke the bolt moves back, compressing the main spring until the bolt and hammer are connected by the sear. At this time a single ball drops into the breech. Next, during the forward pump stroke, both the bolt and hammer move forward, chambering the paintball sealing the breech. Next, as the trigger is pulled, the sear pivots and releases the hammer from the bolt. The compressed main spring forces the hammer back until it reaches the rear of the power tube and provides enough energy to force the power tube back. As the power tube is pushed back the valve opens and compressed gas flows through the power tube and the tuned port compensator (TPC), projecting the paintball out of the barrel.|$|E
