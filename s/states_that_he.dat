5|$|All {{accounts}} {{agree that}} Pain married in 1115 {{and that his}} wife was named Sybil, although the identity of Sybil's parents is unclear. Pain's Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> married Sybil Talbot, the niece of Hugh de Lacy. The Complete Peerage <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> married Sybil, the daughter of Geoffrey Talbot and Talbot's wife Agnes, who was herself probably the daughter of Walter de Lacy. The historian K. S. B. Keats-Rohan states that Pain married Sybil de Lacy, the daughter of Hugh de Lacy, a view shared by fellow historians Judith Green and Paul Dalton. Others such as Bruce Coplestone-Crow and David Crouch agree with the Oxford Dictionary of National Biographys designation of Sybil as Hugh's niece, and daughter of Geoffrey Talbot and Agnes, the sister of Hugh de Lacy.|$|E

5|$|When Stewie {{starts to}} feel pain around {{the inside of}} his mouth, Lois notices and <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is teething. Stewie quickly {{responds}} by asking her to kill him, or to shake him like a British nanny, a reference to the Louise Woodward case.|$|E

5000|$|Taylor was {{considered}} to be a possible H-back candidate in the National Football League. Scouts <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had [...] "solid hands" [...] and [...] "snatches low and high throws with equal aplomb". They also <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was quick on his routes and could separate linebackers from the inside or outside. For his negatives they <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> only had [...] "average" [...] size for his position and did not possess the strength to be an inside linebacker. They also <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not separate with the speed of NFL linebackers.|$|R
50|$|Soviet sources {{initially}} falsely <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was sent}} to Siberia for 10 years without the right to correspond. False death certificates were issued to <b>state</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died in 1943.|$|R
5|$|Back at home, {{the family}} is happy to see Meg, who admits remembering nothing between the {{proposal}} and being in a French hospital. Lois tells Meg that they found Ruth with her tongue cut out. Peter <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has saved Meg's mail then reveals {{that to be a}} joke as Meg had not received any mail.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{was born}} near Salona in Dalmatia (Solin in modern Croatia), some time around 244. His parents {{gave him the}} Greek name Diocles, or {{possibly}} Diocles Valerius. The modern historian Timothy Barnes takes his official birthday, 22 December, as his actual birthdate. Other historians are not so certain. Diocles' parents were of low status, and writers critical of him claimed {{that his father was}} a scribe or a freedman of the senator Anullinus, or even that Diocles was a freedman himself. The first forty years of his life are mostly obscure. The Byzantine chronicler Joannes Zonaras <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was Dux Moesiae, a commander of forces on the lower Danube. The often-unreliable Historia Augusta <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> served in Gaul, but this account is not corroborated by other sources and is ignored by modern historians of the period. The first time Diocletian's whereabouts are accurately established, in 282, he was made by the newly Emperor Carus commander of the Protectores domestici, the élite cavalry force directly attached to the Imperial household – a post that earned him the honor of a consulship in 283. As such, he took part in Carus' subsequent Persian campaign.|$|E
5|$|He {{is the son}} of Jeanne and Jerome Comminges, and {{has three}} brothers. Comminges was born in Les Abymes, Guadeloupe, and was raised in Petit-Canal. He <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> grew up always wanting to be a {{professional}} footballer; playing football in the streets in his hometown before playing organised football from the age of seven upwards, despite his mothers initial reluctance for him to pursue a career in football. Following his move to France, Comminges attended Louis Thuillier High School in Amiens.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with RapGenius, Mystikal <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was reluctant to release the song as a single at 1st, <b>stating</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> felt <b>that</b> it didn't adequately showcase his abilities as an artist. However, <b>he</b> <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was grateful it was released, saying that its success [...] "proved me wrong" [...] {{and that it was}} the [...] "biggest song of my career".|$|R
5000|$|Initially, Bernard <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{could not}} {{remember}} making it, but later insisted <b>that</b> what <b>he</b> said had been thoroughly distorted. Bernard's press secretary stated, [...] "He does not deny the remarks, he just says first of all {{what he said was}} distorted." [...] <b>He</b> also <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was outraged <b>that</b> a private discussion was reported by the media and clearly <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would not apologise.|$|R
5000|$|On July 11, 2014, Morrow {{signed as}} a free agent to a one-year deal with the Tampa Bay Lightning. On June 17, 2015, during exit interviews, Morrow <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may [...] "give it one more go," [...] though <b>he</b> <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could change his mind in two weeks when it was time to resume workouts. Morrow <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not spoken to Lightning General Manager Steve Yzerman about {{returning}} to the team, but <b>he</b> <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would love to return. Morrow said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> [...] "had more fun here in this short time than I've had in I don't know how many years." ...|$|R
5|$|In 1275, Magnús Óláfsson's illegitimate son, Guðrøðr, led {{a revolt}} on Mann and {{attempted}} to establish himself as king. According to the Chronicle of Mann and the Chronicle of Lanercost, a Scottish fleet landed on Mann on 7 October, and {{early the next morning}} the revolt was crushed as the Scots routed the rebels at the Battle of Ronaldsway. Guðrøðr may very well have been slain in the defeat, although one source, the continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum, <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>he,</b> his wife and his followers escaped the carnage to Wales.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 Hata {{argued that}} the {{recently}} released monologue of Emperor Hirohito, the former Emperor's recollection of wartime Japan which he recorded shortly after World War II, had likely been created {{to prove to the}} United <b>States</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not involved in war crimes and consequently Hata theorized that an English language translation must have also been drawn up at the same time, a theory which was mocked by right-wing scholars who felt the monologue was created as a simple historical record without ulterior motives. In 1997 the English language draft was discovered.|$|E
5|$|Lindow <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{feels that}} even if the two are not identical, the various {{accounts}} of the war seem to share the idea of a disruptive entry of persons into a people. Lindow compares the appearance of Gullveig/Heiðr into the Æsir to that of Hœnir and Mímir's disruption amongst the Vanir in Heimskringla. Lindow further states that all three accounts share the notion of acquisition of tools for the conquest of wisdom; the practice of seiðr in two accounts and the head of Mímir in one.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, Crapo <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{disagreed}} <b>that</b> more {{gun control}} regulations would curb {{violence in the}} United <b>States.</b> <b>He</b> also <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> supported efforts to improve mental health access rather than more gun laws.|$|R
5|$|Murray {{grew up in}} Dunblane and {{attended}} Dunblane Primary School. He and his brother were present during the 1996 Dunblane school massacre, when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher before shooting himself; Murray took cover in a classroom. Murray says {{he was too young}} to understand what was happening and is reluctant to talk about it in interviews, but in his autobiography Hitting Back he <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car. Murray later attended Dunblane High School.|$|E

5|$|The ancestry of Æthelberht, Eadbald's father, {{is given}} by Bede, who <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was descended from the legendary founder of Kent, Hengist. However, historians believe that Hengist and his brother Horsa were {{probably}} mythical figures.

5|$|The {{following}} morning, Blackadder calls Field Marshal Haig and {{reminds him}} of his debt; Haig reluctantly advises using the underpants method, and abruptly hangs up, sealing Blackadder's fate. Darling arrives, and his animosity with Blackadder dissolves as they are both put in the same situation. George tries to cheer everybody up, but finds himself as scared as the others. Darling <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had hoped to live through the War, return to England and marry his fiancée.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} his death was disputed. The British {{government}} <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died of pneumonia; the Gaughan family <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died after prison doctors injured him fatally when food lodged in a lung punctured by a force-feeding tube.|$|R

This area is now centred on Dunmore, County Galway.|$|R
5|$|The {{notion that}} the ship would have nailed her flag and never surrendered, as Barère claimed, is never {{accounted}} {{in any of the}} reports. Though Jean François Renaudin never explicitly <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> surrendered, he does mention that he had his flag flown half-mast in distress when he was surrounded by British ships, indicating that he was requesting assistance from the enemy. Griffiths observes that Vengeur was dismasted to the point that there would have been nothing on which to nail a flag anyway, and James makes mentions of Vengeur hoisting the Union Jack in submission.|$|E
5|$|Æthelred (or Ethelred; died 30 June 888) was an Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury {{in medieval}} England. Although one source <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was Bishop of Wiltshire {{prior to his}} {{elevation}} to Canterbury, this {{has been shown to}} be false. Much of Æthelred's time in office was spent dealing with the dislocations caused by the invasion of England by Vikings. There were also conflicts with King Alfred the Great over ecclesiastical matters as well as the desire of the papacy to reform the English clergy.|$|E
5|$|A fictionalized memoir set in {{both the}} United States and France during the 1960s American civil rights movement, White Dog focuses on the events that occur after Gary and his then-wife Jean Seberg, an actress and an activist, adopt a {{handsome}} and clearly well-trained German Shepherd dog who comes back to their home with one of their other dogs. At first, the dog, which they name Batka, is an ideal new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment of other animals. To their dismay, they discover that the dog, a former Alabama police dog, was trained to attack black people on sight. Although they are told the dog is {{too old to be}} retrained, they take him to a black dog trainer to try. Instead, the man trains the dog to attack white people, including Gary himself. Gary <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> changed the ending of the American version to be more optimistic.|$|E
