50|$|Operating along river {{lines of}} {{communication}} meant that Grant's army often would leave behind its excellent strategic telegraph network. Memphis, two days by steamboat from Vicksburg, was the nearest telegraph station upriver, and the telegraph lines running north from Memphis often were cut by guerrillas. For much of the campaign, Cairo, Illinois, was the closest point that had reliable telegraph links with the East. Once Grant began operations south of Vicksburg, he essentially broke off his communications with Washington. President Lincoln, on 22 May 1863 (the day Grant launched his deliberate assault against Vicksburg), telegraphed Major General Stephen Hurlbutt at Memphis with a <b>situation</b> <b>update</b> based upon information gleaned from Confederate newspapers smuggled out of Richmond. The next day, Lincoln, {{who had not yet}} heard from Grant about his landing at Bruinsburg, finally received a telegraphic report. Grant's message, describing his operations since 30 April, had been sent upriver by courier on a steamer only after the Federal army had closed on the city on 18 May.|$|E

40|$|Documentation science, a {{predecessor}} {{of information}} science, historically neglected {{to study a}} common person. As {{a product of the}} Fordist Era, documentation science supposed the value of any information on behavior was its technical and economic nature. In contrast, this article presents some of the contributions of the paradigm of informational behavior, which moves away from this trend, and it emphasizes on a formal standardized information system to study a common use and that user’s day-to-day life. Informational Behavior develops an ecological and evolutionary epistemology. Knowledge workers are no longer the only Community worthy of being studied.

40|$|Crop yield {{forecasting}} uses meteorological data, soil properties, {{management practices}} and genotype data to predict crop yields {{in a given}} area prior to harvest. Crop yield forecasting is an important tool for food security planning as it allows decision makers to make decisions related to pricing, export/import, distribution etc., which helps avoid a situation of food insecurity. Reliable crop yield forecasting becomes {{all the more important}} in the context of climate change since climate change exacerbates the unpredictability of crop yields for a given season. In Nepal, crop yield estimation typically took a more traditional approach combining sample crop cutting data with field surveys, and field verification reports from the District Agricultural Development Offices (DADOs). Based on the information gathered through these processes, and additional field verifications and consultations, the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MoAD), World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) releases crop situation updates twice a year, after the summer and winter harvests. While this process has its advantages, it is time consuming and costly. The crop cut results can take between six months to over one year to provide a basis for the area and production estimates and the results only become available after the crops are actually harvested. In this context, CCAFS partnered with WFP and MoAD to deploy and test the CCAFS Regional Agriculture Forecasting Toolbox (CRAFT) to estimate in-season crop yields for wheat and paddy. CRAFT produced real-time estimates of production much before official estimates based on field measurements were made available. The outputs of this approach for two consecutive seasons form the basis of Nepal's Food Security Monitoring System (NeKSAP), and results were published through the Nepal Food Security Bulletin and Crop <b>Situation</b> <b>Update...</b>|$|E

Participants performed a simulated search and rescue team task and were equipped with a digitized map and realtime <b>situation</b> <b>updates</b> on the location of other participants in a simulated disaster area. The connection to a server, however, was made deliberately error-prone, leading to occasional losses of network connections. Consequently, participants were not provided with real-time <b>situation</b> <b>updates.</b> To deal with this problem we equipped team members with a network-aware application that signaled network loss to them and adapted the graphical representation of the location of fellow team members accordingly to the quality of location information present. The experiment revealed that presenting complete and reliable geospatial information improves teamwork. Teams connected to a server over a fast and reliable link showed superior performance over teams with no network connection whatsoever to a server. The present study failed, however, to demonstrate the added value of network-aware support when teams had to collaborate in the presence of an unreliable communications infrastructure. Although participants indicated a slight preference for the network-aware application over a condition without support signaling network loss, no differences were observed in team process and outcome measures...|$|R

Such a decomposition may lead to prohibitive computational times in an industrial context due to its complexity.

40|$|Nowadays, both {{military}} and civil emergency scenarios demand shared-situation awareness between the front-line elements, {{in order to}} maximize the effectiveness of the operations. This requires a communication system based on mechanisms that self-adapt to dynamic conditions and that are able to work under heterogeneous networks. The proposed Cognitive Routable Ad-hoc Network (CRAN) protocol allows efficient and distributed information sharing within the same hierarchy and between distinct hierarchical levels. The CRAN mechanisms contain the control plane, which includes the discovery mechanism and the autonomous adaptation when topology changes, and the data plane, which is responsible to forward tactical messages within the platoon. The evaluation results show that CRAN provides a fast knowledge forwarding with high message delivery and requires small bandwidth. This ensures real-time <b>situation</b> <b>updates,</b> improving operational reality awareness and more accurate decisions, improving the overall operation results...|$|R

40|$|Numerous studies {{demonstrate}} {{the negative effects}} of cognitively loading secondary tasks on driving performance.

While driving, participants had to react to events that were either announced by a warning signal or not. We hypothesized that participants will benefit least from the warning signal when they had to perform the memory updating task. The results generally support this hypothesis indicating that central executive functions of working memory are highly involved in situation awareness processes...|$|R

40|$|The {{overarching}} aim of {{this research}} was to examine potential boundary conditions to situation model construction (Experiment 1) and narrative-based persuasion (Experiment 3). Variables such as narrative perspective (i. e., 2 nd or 3 rd person) and matched characteristics with the reader (i. e., participant-protagonist gender match) were first examined using <b>situation</b> model <b>updating</b> (Experiment 1) and behavioral measures (Experiment 3) as dependent measures. It was expected that <b>situation</b> model <b>updating</b> would be more likely for narratives written in the 2 nd person perspective and with a participant-protagonist gender match. It was uncertain, however, for health promotion narratives, whether these manipulations would increase the likelihood that readers would be persuaded by a story and take informative pamphlets and coupons for samples of sunscreen. The findings of Experiment 1 did not reveal greater <b>situation</b> model <b>updating</b> for 2 nd person matched narratives. Further examination of the stimuli used in the first experiment (Experiment 2) suggested that, relative to past research, while there was greater interest in the stories, there was less imaginability (i. e., picturing oneself as the protagonist). This pattern suggests that while interest in the story content may engage readers for a 3 rd person perspective (i. e., he or she), other factors are necessary for engagement for a 2 nd person perspective (i. e., you). For example, in the latter perspective, it may be that readers must relate to a character 2 ̆ 7 s behavior through actual personal experience before being able to imagine themselves in the story. These insights were applied to the tailoring of a health narrative concerning melanoma and the use of sunscreen in Experiment 3. Participants in Experiment 3 showed a greater likelihood of information seeking and behavioral intentions (e. g., taking pamphlets and coupons for sunscreen) for the 2 nd person perspective regardless of whether there was a participant-protagonist gender match...|$|R

40|$|Although still popular, the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) Loop is {{outdated}} as a {{model of}} human cognition. Based on advances in the cognitive sciences since the 1950 s, the Critique-Explore-Compare-Adapt (CECA) Loop is proposed as a better descriptive model. The model puts two mental representations, the conceptual model established through operational planning, and the situation model, which represents the state of the battlespace, {{at the center of the}} decision making process. The four phases of the CECA Loop broadly correspond to the identification of information needs (Critique), active and passive data collection and <b>situation</b> <b>updating</b> (Explore), comparison of the current situation to the conceptual model (Compare), and adaptation to aspects of the battlespace that invalidate the conceptual model or block the path to goal completion (Adapt). The CECA Loop is intended to serve as a simple but widely applicable framework in which to study decision making in the context of Command and Control (C 2). Some advantages of the CECA Loop over the OODA Loop are greater insight into the nature of perception and understanding, introduction of critical thinking elements, and exposition of the central role of planning and the mental representation of operational concepts in C 2...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Hurricane Sandy {{affected}} {{the east coast}} of U. S. in 2012 and posed immense threats to businesses, human lives and properties. In order to minimize the consequent loss of a catastrophe like this, a critical task in disaster management is to understand <b>situation</b> <b>updates</b> about the disaster from a large number of disaster-related documents, and obtain a big picture of the disaster’s trends and how it affects different areas. In this paper, we present a two-layer storyline generation framework which generates an overall or a global storyline of the disaster events in the first layer, and provides condensed information about specific regions affected by the disaster (i. e., a location-specific storyline) in the second layer. To generate the overall storyline of a disaster, we consider both temporal and spatial factors, which are encoded using integer linear programming. While for location-specific storylines, we employ a Steiner tree based method. Compared with the previous work of storyline generation, which generates flat storylines without considering spatial information, our framework is more suitable for large-scale disaster events. We further demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework through the evaluation on the datasets of three major hurricane disasters...|$|R
