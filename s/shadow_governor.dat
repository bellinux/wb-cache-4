50|$|In February 2017, Deputy head of {{logistics}} Lt. Gen. Thomas Cirillo Swaka resigned, accusing Kiir {{of ethnic}} bias. This {{led to a}} series of high ranking resignations, including minister of Labour Lt. Gen. Gabriel Duop Lam who also pledged allegiance to Machar. Swaka formed a new rebel group called the National Salvation Front (NAS or NSF) in March 2017. In March 2017, Cirillo, an Equatorian, got additional support as SPLM-IO's Western Bahr al Ghazal commander, Faiz Ismail Futur, resigned to joined NAS while there are reports of six SPLM-IO <b>shadow</b> <b>governors</b> from Equatoria defecting to NAS. In the same month, head of the Cobra Faction Khalid Boutros dissolved the Cobra Faction and merged it with Gen. Thomas Cirillo's NAS and claimed opposition groups are in consultation to unite their ranks. In May 2017, opposition groups including NSF, SPLA-IO and Lam Akol signed an agreement to work together to oust Kiir but disagreed over selecting a common chairman. In July 2017, John Kenyi Loburon, SPLA-IO's commander of Central Equatoria state switched to join NAS, claiming favoritism towards Nuers in SPLA-IO and then as NAS general in the same month, fought with SPLA-IO in Central Equatoria in the first clashes between the two groups. The SPLA-IO announced that it had expelled Loburon from the base, though the NAS said that it had repelled two assaults by their rivals and that it went on to pursue the remaining attackers.|$|R

50|$|The {{political}} vision {{behind this}} invasion was <b>shadowed</b> by the <b>governor</b> of Saint-Domingue (today's Haiti) Jean Baptiste Ducasse who brought his soldiers just to steal, {{the original plan}} ending as pirates and thieves again destroying the city. In any case, the entry wasn't easy, because of the recently finished first stage of walls and forts which slowed and made costly the victory. While Desjean only asked for 250,000 Spanish reales in ransom, Jean du Casse stayed {{a few months later}} and dishonored the promise of the Baron of respecting the churches and holy places and left them with nothing. The city again, lost everything. The 18th century begins.|$|R
40|$|In 1915 Governor James Ferguson {{began his}} term in Texas bolstered {{by a wave}} of voter enthusiasm and {{legislative}} cooperation so great that few Texans anticipated anything short of a successful administration. His campaign was based on two key elements: his appeal to the rural constituency and a temporary hiatus {{from the effects of}} the continuous Prohibition debate. In reality, Jim Ferguson had shrewdly sold a well-crafted image of himself to Texas voters, carrying into office a bevy of closely guarded secrets about his personal finances, his business acumen, and his relationship with Texas brewers. Those secrets, once unraveled, ultimately led to charges brought against Governor Ferguson via impeachment. Refusing to acknowledge the judgment against him, Ferguson launched a crusade for regained power and vindication. In 1925 he reclaimed a level of political influence and doubled the Ferguson presence in Austin when he assisted his wife, Miriam, in a successful bid for the governorship. That bid had been based largely on a plea for exoneration but soon degenerated into a scandal-plagued administration. In the <b>Governor’s</b> <b>Shadow</b> unravels this complex tale, exposing the shocking depth of the Fergusons’ misconduct. Often using the Fergusons’ own words, Carol O’Keefe Wilson weaves together the incontestable evidence that most of the claims that Jim Ferguson made during his life regarding his conduct, intentions, achievements, and abilities, were patently false...|$|R
