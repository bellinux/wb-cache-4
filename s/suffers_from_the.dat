Like all questionnaires, the way the instrument is administered can {{have an effect on}} the final score. If a patient is asked to fill out the form in front of other people in a clinical environment, for instance, social expectations have been shown to elicit a different response compared to administration via a postal survey.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} examples of genre science fiction that involves a challenging amount of unconventional sexual activity is the early novel Odd John (1935), by Olaf Stapledon. John is a mutant with extraordinary mental abilities who will not allow himself to be bound {{by many of the}} rules imposed by the ordinary British society of his time. The novel strongly implies that he seduces an older boy who becomes devoted to him but also <b>suffers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> affront that the relationship creates to his own morals.|$|E
5|$|Mumbai <b>suffers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same major {{urbanisation}} problems seen in many {{fast growing}} cities in developing countries: widespread poverty and unemployment, poor {{public health and}} poor civic and educational standards for a large section of the population. With available land at a premium, Mumbai residents often reside in cramped, relatively expensive housing, usually far from workplaces, and therefore requiring long commutes on crowded mass transit, or clogged roadways. Many of them live {{in close proximity to}} bus or train stations although suburban residents spend significant time travelling southward to the main commercial district. Dharavi, Asia's second largest slum (if Karachi's Orangi Town is counted as a single slum) is located in central Mumbai and houses between 800,000 and one million people in , {{making it one of the}} most densely populated areas on Earth with a population density of at least 334,728 persons per square kilometre.|$|E

Yudhishthira claims that Draupadi <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vice of partiality, in her affections for Arjuna. The remaining Pandavas continue their journey. Next, Sahadeva dies on the way. Yudhishthira explains Sahadeva like his other brothers was virtuous in every respect, except he <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vice of pride and vanity, thought none was equal to him in wisdom. The brothers continue on their way to Mount Meru. Nakula dies next. Yudhishthira explains that Nakula also <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vice of pride and vanity, thinking he was the most handsome person in the world. Arjuna is the next person to die without completing the journey. Yudhishthira explains to Bhima, Arjuna too <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vice of pride and vanity, thinking he was the most skilled, most powerful warrior in the world. Yudhishthira, Bhima and the dog continue forward.|$|R

After becoming a vegan, Wynn announced that he would add animal-free menus to all his restaurants.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the debate}} is mathematical, but some major {{elements}} can be explained in simple terms {{and as part of}} the 'aggregation problem'. That is, the critique of neoclassical capital theory might be summed up as saying that it <b>suffers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fallacy of composition, i.e., that we cannot simply jump from microeconomic conceptions to an understanding of production by society as a whole. The resolution {{of the debate}}, particularly how broad its implications are, has not been agreed upon by economists.|$|E

25|$|Grafting to {{involves}} the strong adsorption or chemical bonding of a polymer molecule to a surface from solution. This process is typically achieved through a coupling agent that links {{a handle on}} the surface to a reactive group on either of the chain termini. Although simple, this approach <b>suffers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> disadvantage of a relatively low grafting density as a result of steric hindrance from the already-attached polymer coils. After coupling, as in all cases, polymers attempt to maximize their entropy typically by assuming a brush or mushroom conformation. Thus, potential binding sites become inaccessible beneath this “mushroom domain”.|$|E
25|$|In-ha <b>suffers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pinocchio Syndrome, {{where she}} cannot lie without {{breaking}} into hiccups. Instead of choosing {{to withdraw from}} the world, she believes in telling it like it is. In-ha chooses to become a reporter because she believes that it might bring her closer to her mother Song Cha-ok, whom she has always idolized. Stubborn and strong-willed, In-ha believes that all news reported must be completely truthful, and goes all out in order to do so. Together with Dal-po, she unravels the truth behind a greater conspiracy, standing up to her mother in the process. Though In-ha initially treats Dal-po as family, her growing feelings towards him grow undeniable with her hiccups.|$|E
25|$|At {{the level}} of quantum field theory, Kaluza–Klein theory unifies gravity with gauge interactions, based on the {{realization}} that gravity propagating in small, compact extra dimensions is equivalent to gauge interactions at long distances. In particular when the geometry of the extra dimensions is trivial, it reproduces electromagnetism. However at sufficiently high energies or short distances, this setup still <b>suffers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same pathologies that famously obstruct direct attempts to describe quantum gravity. Therefore, these models still require a UV completion, {{of the kind that}} string theory is intended to provide. In particular, superstring theory requires six compact dimensions forming a Calabi–Yau manifold. Thus Kaluza-Klein theory may be considered either as an incomplete description on its own, or as a subset of string theory model building.|$|E
