25|$|A digital {{computer}} <b>simulation</b> <b>model</b> of an analog system {{such as the}} brain is an approximation that introduces random quantization errors and distortion. However, the biological neurons also suffer from randomness and limited precision, for example due to background noise. The errors of the discrete model can be made smaller than the randomness of the biological brain by choosing a sufficiently high variable resolution and sample rate, and sufficiently accurate models of non-linearities. The computational power and computer memory must however be sufficient to run such large simulations, preferably in real time.|$|E
30|$|New {{technologies}} and methodologies for smart grid applications cannot {{be tested in}} the real power grid, since it is a safety-critical infrastructure, therefore simulation and co-simulation is utilized. <b>Simulation</b> <b>models</b> itself can rely on quite complex calculations and therefore slow down the simulation. But even less complex models can lead to performance issues when used in large numbers in large-scale setups. The use of surrogate models {{is one way to}} improve the performance of simulation systems when the <b>simulation</b> <b>models</b> are slow, but the performance gain diminishes, when the <b>simulation</b> <b>models</b> are already quite fast. This abstract presents a new PhD project, which proposes a method to combine several <b>simulation</b> <b>models</b> into one surrogate model using correlations and other interdependencies of the <b>simulation</b> <b>models.</b> The goal is to further improve the performance gain not only for slower, but also for less complex <b>simulation</b> <b>models,</b> thus enable even larger simulation setups.|$|R

However, the impact {{of population}} health <b>simulation</b> <b>models</b> is inhibited by their complexity {{and the lack of}} established standards to describe these models. To address this issue, we are developing the Ontology for <b>Simulation</b> <b>Modeling</b> of Population Health (SimPHO) – a formal, explicit, computer-readable approach to describing population health <b>simulation</b> <b>models.</b> SimPHO builds on previous work to classify and formally represent knowledge about <b>simulation</b> <b>models,</b> and incorporates the semantics of the epidemiology and public health domains. SimPHO will allow model developers to make explicit their assumptions, to describe their models in a formal, consistent and interoperable manner, and to facilitate model reuse and integration.

Evaluating {{the performance}} of these systems by means of mathematical models is not yet feasible. As a result, the creation of <b>simulation</b> <b>models</b> is usually {{the only means of}} predicting and evaluating {{the performance of}} such systems. In this paper, we use measurements to validate <b>simulation</b> <b>models</b> of TCP/IP over high speed ATM wide area networks. Validation of simulations with measurements is not common � however, it is needed so that <b>simulation</b> <b>models</b> can be used with con dence to accurately characterize the performance of ATM WANs.

40|$|In recent years, <b>simulation</b> <b>modelling</b> of {{software}} processes have has promoted {{as a tool}} to understand, study, control, and manage software development processes. Claims have been made that <b>simulation</b> <b>models</b> are useful and effective at gaining insight into software development processes.

The <b>simulation</b> <b>modelling</b> process is believed to have had an effect on the quality of a simulation study.

This thesis reports how the development and evaluation of a <b>simulation</b> <b>modelling</b> process for novice software process simulation modellers. The rapid <b>simulation</b> <b>modelling</b> process (RSMP) is based on an empirical study of the contexts and practices of expert simulation modellers in SPSM and Operational Research (OR).

The RSMP has been evaluated through controlled experiments with novice software process simulation modellers using system dynamics (SD) modelling. In the future, it will be further evaluated with software process simulation modellers using discrete event simulation. The RSMP has also been evaluated with a panel of expert software process simulation modellers.
