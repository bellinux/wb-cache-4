60|$|The {{distance}} {{from this point}} {{in a straight line}} to his destination was only a mile; but a rocky bluff and a ravine necessitated his making a wide detour. While lightly leaping over a brook his keen eye fell on an imprint in the sandy loam. Instantly he was on his knees. The footprint was small, evidently a woman's, and, what was more unusual, instead of the flat, round moccasin-track, it was pointed, with a sharp, <b>square</b> <b>heel.</b> Such shoes were not worn by border girls. True Betty and Nell had them; but they never went into the woods without moccasins.|$|E

40|$|Although {{footwear}} {{has been}} recognised as {{a risk factor}} for falls in older people, it remains unclear as to which features of shoes are beneficial or detrimental to balance. This project aimed to systematically investigate the effects of common shoe features, namely: an elevated heel, a soft sole, a hard sole, a flared sole, a bevelled heel, a high-collar and a tread sole, on balance and gait in older community-dwelling people. The experimental shoes were compared to standard shoes in three studies examining: (i) standing balance, leaning balance and stepping in 29 older people, (ii) centre of mass (COM) -base of support (BOS) margins, vertical and braking loading rates, and perceived shoe comfort and stability in 11 young and 15 older people walking on even and uneven surfaces, and (iii) temporal-spatial gait variables, pelvis acceleration, and gait termination in 10 young and 26 older people, on level, irregular and wet surfaces. Elevated heel shoes impaired overall performance in functional tests of balance and stepping. They were also perceived as lacking comfort and stability and led to a conservative walking pattern characterised by increased step width and double-support time, reduced braking and vertical loading rates and medio-lateral (ML) pelvis accelerations on various surfaces. Soft sole shoes increased lateral COM-BOS margin and step width, indicating reduced ML walking stability. When wearing these shoes, subjects had longer total stopping times and on the wet surface, smaller step lengths and shoe/floor angles at heel strike, suggesting a potential risk of slipping. When wearing high-collar shoes, subjects had better balance as demonstrated by small but significant increases in lateral COM-BOS margin, double-support time and step width, and decreases in ML pelvis accelerations on varying surfaces and in total stopping time on the wet surface. Shoes with hard, flared or tread soles or a bevelled heel did not affect balance. In conclusion, providing that they are fitted, have adequate fastening and perhaps a slip-resistant sole, shoes with a low <b>square</b> <b>heel,</b> a sole of medium hardness (shore A- 40) and a high-collar provide the greatest stability for older people when walking on dry, wet and irregular surfaces...|$|E

50|$|Both {{aircraft}} {{had similar}} but not identical conventional empennages. They had wooden, fabric over ply covered fins and fabric covered, unbalanced rudders. Both fins had straight, slightly swept leading edges and, including the rudder, blunt tops, but {{the area of}} the IS-13's fin was increased with a dorsal fillet. Its rudder was slightly <b>squarer</b> at the <b>heel</b> and also larger in area than that of the IS-12. The horizontal tails, mounted on top of the fuselages, were similar straight tapered surfaces but set 130 mm further forward on the fillet on the IS-13, with the result that the IS-12's cut-out for rudder movement in the elevators was not needed. Both models had a trim tab on the starboard elevator and a tail bumper under the rudder Overall the S-13 was 400 mm longer.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{increase}} in sea surface temperature and ocean acidification raises major {{concerns about the}} evolution of the coral calcification rate. Digitized X-radiographs have been used for coral skeleton density measurements since the 1980 s. The main limitation of coral densitometry from digitized X-radiographs is the X-ray intensity heterogeneity due to spherical spreading (inverse <b>square</b> law) and <b>heel</b> effect. Until now, extra X-ray images or aluminum standards have been used to correct X-radiographs. However, such corrective methods may be constraining when working with a high number of coral samples. Here, we present an inexpensive, straightforward, and accurate digital detrending (DD) method to correct the heterogeneities of the X-ray irradiation that affect X-radiographs. The X-radiograph is corrected against the irradiation imprint recorded by its own background using a kriging interpolation method, thus allowing reliable optical density measurements directly on the corrected X-ray image. This digital detrending (DD) method was validated using skeletal bulk density measurements and computerized tomography (CT). Coral densitometry using DD corrected X-radiographs does not require the destruction of the coral sample and provides high-resolution measurements. Since DD does not require extra aluminum standards to correct X-radiographs, this method optimizes the working space available on the X-ray image. Moreover, it corrects the entire X-radiograph, thus larger samples or numerous samples can be X-rayed at the same time...|$|R
