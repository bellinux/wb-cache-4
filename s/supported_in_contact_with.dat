40|$|In this report, we {{describe}} the methodology for 96 parallel organic syntheses of peptides on Teflon-patterned paper assisted by heating with an infra-red lamp. SPOT synthesis is an important technology for production of peptide arrays on a paper-based support for rapid identification of peptide ligands, epitope mapping, and identification of bio-conjugation reactions. The major drawback of the SPOT synthesis methodology published to-date is suboptimal reaction conversion due to mass transport limitations in the unmixed reaction spot. The technology developed in this report overcomes these problems by changing {{the environment of the}} reaction from static to dynamic (flow-through), and further accelerating the reaction by selective heating of the reaction <b>support</b> <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> activated amino acids. Patterning paper with Teflon allows for droplets of organic solvents to be confined in a zone on the paper array and flow through the paper at a well-defined rate and provide a convenient, power-free setup for flow-through solid-phase synthesis and efficient assembly of peptide arrays. We employed an infra-red (IR) lamp to locally heat the cellulosic support during the flow-through delivery of the reagents to each zone of the paper-based array. We demonstrate that IR-heating in solid phase peptide synthesis shortened the reaction time necessary for amide bond formation down to 3 minutes; in some couplings of alpha amino acids, conversion rates increased up to fifteen folds. The IR-heating improved the assembly of difficult sequences, such as homo-oligomers of all 20 natural amino acids...|$|R

Myers bellied in on the 2,500-foot runway and took cover behind an embankment {{on the edge of}} the strip while Fisher directed the rescue effort. Since the closest helicopter was 30 minutes away and the enemy was only 200 yd from Myers, Fisher quickly decided to land his two-seat A-1E on the strip and pick up his friend. Under the cover provided by the other A-1s, he landed in the valley, taxied to Myer's position, and loaded the downed airman into the empty seat. Dodging shell holes and debris on the steel-planked runway, Fisher took off safely despite many hits on his aircraft by small-arms fire.|$|R
25|$|On {{the right}} of the 24th Division, the 73rd Brigade {{attacked}} either side of the Trônes Wood–Guillemont track; the battalion to the south, kept close to the barrage but was stopped by machine-gun fire, at the German front line. Attempts to get into the trench failed and a German counter-bombardment made the passage of reinforcements impossible. The battalion attacking north of the track was also held up on the right but on the left managed to get into the German front line, near the quarry despite German counter-attacks, as British reinforcements arrived to help consolidate. To the north, touch was gained with the right-hand battalion of the 17th Brigade, which had been unable to see where the barrage began to creep but had advanced anyway and taken many German prisoners. The brigade reached the German front line and part of Waterlot Farm road, at the second objective which were quickly consolidated.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to look into the correctional system’s work with parent ship of incarcerated mothers and fathers from a gender perspective. It is a {{qualitative}} study and two interviews have been done with employees from a prison for women and one interview from a prison for men. Two interviews have been done with two former incarcerated parents, one mother and one father. One interview has also been done with an organization which gives children with incarcerated parents support and an opportunity to meet other children in the same situation. They also give incarcerated parents <b>support</b> <b>in</b> the <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> their children. The results of the study imply that the correctional system has the same theoretical approach when working with incarcerated mothers and fathers. It is obvious that when it comes to attitudes and presumptions about parent ship, there are differences based on a gender perspective. This affects the practical work with parent ship within the correctional system. The results show that gender is always present in the discussion about parent ship within the correctional system even though the framework tells us different. This makes it even more important to be aware about how gender makes us look at parent ship depending on sex. Not least in the correctional system. ...|$|R
40|$|Mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGLs) are {{longitudinally}} aligned corrugations (ridge-groove structures 6 - 100 km long) in sediment produced subglacially. They are {{indicators of}} fast flow {{and a common}} signature of ice-stream beds. We develop a qualitative theory that accounts for their formation, and use numerical modelling, and observations of ice-stream beds to provide <b>supporting</b> evidence. Ice <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> a rough (scale of 10 - 10 (3) m) bedrock surface will mimic {{the form of the}} bed. Because of flow acceleration and convergence in ice-stream onset zones, the ice-base roughness elements experience transverse strain, transforming them from irregular bumps into longitudinally aligned keels of ice protruding downwards. Where such keels slide across a soft sedimentary bed, they plough through the sediments, carving elongate grooves, and deforming material up into intervening ridges. This explains MSGLs and has important implications for ice-stream mechanics. Groove ploughing provides the means to acquire new lubricating sediment and to transport large volumes of it downstream. Keels may provide basal drag in the force budget of ice streams, thereby playing a role in flow regulation and stability We speculate that groove ploughing permits significant ice-stream widening, thus facilitating high-magnitude ice discharge...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel emitter tip having {{the shape of}} a nib and based on an open structure for nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nanoESI-MS). The nib structure is fabricated with standard lithography techniques using SU- 8, an epoxy-based negative photoresist. The tip is comprised of a reservoir, a capillary slot and a point-like feature, and is fabricated on a silicon wafer. We present here a novel scheme for interfacing such nib tips to MS by applying the ionization voltage directly onto the semi-conductor support. The silicon <b>support</b> is <b>in</b> direct <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the liquid to be analyzed at the reservoir and microchannel level, thus allowing easy use in ESI-MS. This scheme is especially advantageous for automated analysis as the manual step of positioning a metallic wire into the reservoir is avoided. In addition, the analysis performance was enhanced compared with the former scheme, as demonstrated by the tests of standard peptides (gramicidin S, Glu-fibrinopeptide B). The limit of detection was determined to be lower than 10 − 2 μM. Due to their enhanced performance, these microfabricated sources might be of great interest for analysis requiring very high sensitivity, such as proteomics analysis using nanoESI-MS...|$|R
40|$|Aims Court liaison {{services}} aim {{to reduce}} mental illness in prison through early treatment and/or diversion into care of defendants negotiating their court proceedings. However, liaison services may inadvertently contribute to gender inequalities {{in mental health}} in the prison system. This is because women often do not access liaison services. This is attributed to services failing to recognise that women have different needs from men. To address this, {{it is essential that}} the needs of women <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the criminal justice system (CJS) are clearly articulated. However, there is a dearth of research that considers women’s needs at this stage of their journey through the CJS. This paper aims to identify these needs before women enter prison. It does so through an analysis of a pilot Women’s Support Service based at a Magistrates’ Court, a response to concerns that women were not accessing the local liaison service. Characteristics of women defendants attending the service are described, specifically their home environments, general and mental health needs. Their <b>support</b> needs when <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the CJS and the links the service must forge with local community organisations to provide this, are also presented. This knowledge will develop/ tailor existing services available to women defendants to improve their access to these and optimise the benefits they can derive from them. Methods Proformas were completed by a women specialist worker for 86 women defendants assessed in 4 months. Information was collected on characteristics including education, domestic violence, accommodation, physical and mental health [...] This specialist worker recorded the range of needs identified by defendants at assessment and the services to which women were referred.

The gLite WMS has been tested very intensively for the LHC experiments use cases {{for more than six}} months, both in terms of performance and reliability. The tests were carried out by the LCG Experiment Integration <b>Support</b> team (<b>in</b> close <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the experiments) together with the EGEE integration and certification team and the gLite middleware developers. A pragmatic iterative and interactive approach allowed a very quick rollout of fixes and their rapid deployment, together with new functionalities, for the ATLAS production activities. The same approach is being adopted for other middleware components like the gLite and CREAM Computing Elements. In this contribution we will summarize the learning from the gLite WMS testing activity, pointing out the most important achievements and the open issues. In addition, we will present the current situation of the ATLAS simulated event production activity on the EGEE infrastructure based on the gLite WMS, showing the main improvements and benefits from the new middleware.
