50|$|The leaf {{gives rise}} to a {{terminal}} inflorescence with one to eight flowers. Sometimes this inflorescence is subtended by a <b>spathaceous</b> <b>bract,</b> sometimes erroneously called spathe (spathe is a typical form in some other families such as Araceae and Arecaceae). The flowers have similarly shaped sepals and petals, and can be yellow, pink, lavender, magenta, orange and red.|$|E

The strap-shaped leaves are 1-1.5 m long and 3-5 cm wide, spiny {{along the edges}} and beneath the midrib. The tiny female flowers are covered by leaves; male flowers are borne on 50 cm long inflorescences {{enclosed}} in white <b>spathaceous</b> <b>bracts.</b> The fruits occur as dense spheroidal clusters about 20 cm across, red when ripe. The flowering season is from December to April.|$|R
40|$|Erect herbs {{with a short}} rhizome. Leaves linear radical or crowded at {{the stem}} base, distich, equitant, parallel-nerved. Flowers zygomorphic, bisexual, solitary in the axil of <b>spathaceous</b> <b>bracts.</b> Perianth corolline, {{segments}} 4, 2 -seriate. Stamen 1, inserted {{at the base of}} the abaxial segments. Filament flattened; anther 2 -celled; cells straight or twisted, opening lengthwise by slits. Ovary superior, 3 -celled with axile placentas, or 1 -celled with parietal placentas. Style simple. Ovules ~, anatropous. Capsule with 3 valves. Seeds ~. Distr. Centering in Australia, comprises 4 genera with 5 species...|$|R
5000|$|E. dendrobii is a terrestrial, {{sympodial}} orchid {{with tall}} (~1.2 m.) slender stems without any swelling, covered with foliaceous sheaths, most tipped with long, acute, slightly keeled, distichous leaves. [...] The inflorescenses are short (1.5 cm) lateral racemes, or sometimes (Reichenbach, 1861) panicles, carrying {{six to eight}} waxy-textured flowers arising between <b>spathaceous</b> <b>bracts.</b> The sepals are somewhat broader than the petals. The lip is trilobate, with the lateral lobes larger than the median lobe. The callus consists of two lamina {{at the apex of}} the column, followed by three broad keels.|$|R
40|$|Trees or shrubs, glabrous or with an indumentum {{of single}} hairs. Leaves spirally arranged, simple, entire or 2 — 10 -lobed, penninerved, {{evergreen}} or deciduous; stipules present, at first enclosing {{and protecting the}} innovations, later caducous and leaving an annular scar around the node. Flowers terminal or pseudoaxillary on a short shoot in the axils of the leaves, bisexual, rarely unisexual, pedunculate. Peduncle bearing 1 or more caducous <b>spathaceous</b> <b>bracts</b> which leave annular scars. Perianth spiral or spirocyclic, simple or differentiated in calyx and corolla, perianth members 6 or more, free, imbricate. Stamens numerous, free, spirally arranged; filaments short or more or less elongated; anthers linear, 2 -locular, dehiscing introrsely, latrorsely or rarely extrorsely; connective usually more or less produced into an appendage. Gynoecium sessile or stipitate (a gynophore present); carpels numerous to few (rarely one), spirally arranged (except in Pachylarnax), free or sometimes concrescent; ovules 2 or more, biseriate on the ventral suture. Fruit apocarpous, sometimes syncarpous; fruiting carpels opening along the dorsal and/or ventral suture, or circumscissile, rarely indehiscent. Seed(s) 1 or more in each fruiting carpel, large, in dehiscent carpels hanging from the elongated spiral vessels of the funiculus, with arilloid testa, rarely, when fruit indehiscent adherent to the endocarp; endosperm copious, oily; embryo minute. Distribution. Seven genera in temperate and tropical SE. and E. Asia and from North America southward through the West Indies and Central America to S. Brazil...|$|R

5000|$|E. rigidum {{has been}} placed in the {{subgenus}} E. subg Epidendrum Lindl. (1841) because its sympodial stems do not thicken to form pseudobulbs, its stems are covered by the basal sheaths of its distichous leaves, and its peduncle emerges from the apical leaf without being covered by any bract or sheath. The basal parts of the stems unite to form a creeping rhizome; the upper parts grow to 20 cm long and can assume erect, horizontal, or hanging postures. [...] The lathery ovate-oblong obtuse leaves are 3-8 cm long and apically bilobed. As {{with other members of}} E. subsect. Spathacea Rchb.f. 1861, the racemose inflorescence bears enlarged <b>spathaceous</b> floral <b>bracts.</b> The green, non-resupinate, fleshy flowers are partially covered by the large, dolabriform bracts. The ovate obtuse sepals are 5 mm long, with the lateral sepals larger than the dorsal sepal. The linear petals are also 5 mm long. As {{with other members of the}} genus Epidendrum, the lip is adnate to the column to its apex. The lip is heart-shaped where it diverges from the column, ovate, and obtuse at the apex.|$|R
40|$|Monoecious, marsh or aquatic plants, with perennial, {{creeping}} rootstocks and erect, terete stems. Leaves alternate, linear or strap-shaped, sheathing at the base, flat, slightly convex on the back. Flowers unisexual, densely {{crowded in}} simple, compact, cylindric spikes. Male inflorescence terminal and {{separated from the}} female spike or contiguous to it; each spike subtended by <b>spathaceous,</b> usually fugacious, <b>bracts</b> and divided at intervals by smaller caducous bracts. Perianth consisting of bristles. Male flowers with 3, rarely 1 — 7 stamens; the filaments free or connate; the anthers linear or oblong, basifixed, 2 -celled, with longitudinal dehiscence; the connective produced beyond the cells in a conical, carnose acumen; pollen grains simple or compound. Female flowers with a one-celled, superior, stipitate and fusiform ovary; the ovule solitary and anatropous; the style elongate, slender, erect; the stigma ligulate, spathulate, lanceolate or linear. Among the female flowers many sterile ones with clavate tips. Fruit minute, stipitate, fusiform or ellipsoid, with a membranaceous or coriaceous pericarp, splitting longitudinally. Seed subcylindric or narrowly ellipsoid; the testa membranaceous; albumen farinaceous. Embryo cylindric, straight. About 8 species in one genus, widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions...|$|R
