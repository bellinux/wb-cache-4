40|$|BACKGROUND: Associations between parental {{expressed}} emotion (EE) or parental attributions and {{the problem}} behaviours of children with intellectual disability (ID) have been explored in ID research. However, a more detailed examination of the attributional model of EE has not been reported. In the present study, we partially replicated and extended research focused on mothers of typically developing children with behaviour problems. METHODS: Twenty-seven mothers of children with ID and behaviour problems aged 4 - 9 years were interviewed about their most problematic behaviours exhibited by their child, and completed a Five Minute Speech <b>Sample.</b> <b>Interview</b> <b>transcripts</b> and speech samples were coded for maternal EE and spontaneous causal attributions regarding the child's behaviour problems. Data were also collected on maternal well-being, and the child's behaviour problems. RESULTS: Mothers typically made attributions that were internal to the child, controllable by the child, personal to the child and stable for the child. Maternal attributions {{of being able to}} control the child's behaviour were associated with high maternal criticism and low warmth. Maternal depression was more strongly associated with the child's behaviour problems when mothers were coded as high in criticism or low in warmth. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of maternal attributions about their child's behaviour problems and their consequences for maternal well-being and maternal-child relationships require more research attention. Implications for practice are discussed, including the potential for maternal attributions to be incompatible with the focus of positive behaviour supports offered to families...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{addition}} to attitude, perception, personality/self-concept and learning, motivation {{is a crucial}} psychological factor that impacts tourist behaviour (Boo 2 ̆ 6 Jones, 2009; Chen 2 ̆ 6 Uysal, 2003; Fodness, 1994; Jang 2 ̆ 6 Cai, 2002; Maslow, 1943; Yuan 2 ̆ 6 McDonald, 1990). Since people have travelled {{more and more in}} recent years, the necessity of understanding the motivational factors of travel has also become increasingly important (Yuan 2 ̆ 6 McDonald, 1990). Knowledge, in return, helps stakeholders better accommodate the needs of future travellers of all kinds, in the planning of transportation infrastructures, accommodation, retailing, dining and entertainment (Li, Law 2 ̆ 6 Wang, 2010). Thus, tourism research benefits the economic, environmental and cultural sustainability of touristic destinations, especially in rural areas and in developing countries (World Travel 2 ̆ 6 Tourism Council, 2015). LITERATURE: Travelling in general is commonly linked to happiness, a search for a ‘getaway’ or a recurrent modern way of escaping from daily stress. Many believe that it increases quality of life due to the many benefits travelling induces (Hsu 2 ̆ 6 Huang, 2008; Cai 2 ̆ 6 Jang, 2002; Chick, Durrenberger, Ribeiro 2 ̆ 6 Yarnal, 2009). But while most studies have put focus on the mainstream travellers, almost none have shown interest for the long-term travellers that dedicate a big part of their life to exploring the world. The term long-term traveller refers to a person who travels widely (Merriam- Webster Dictionary) and spends more time travelling than a traditional holiday period would allow, most often longer than a year (Elsrud, 2001, cited in Brun, Larsen 2 ̆ 6 Øgaard, 2011). This particular way of extended holidaying has gained popularity since the 1960 s (Brun, Larsen 2 ̆ 6 Øgaard, 2011), but because this trend is relatively new, literature on the topic is still rare. METHODS: The current study was inspired mainly by the work of Brun, Larsen 2 ̆ 6 Øgaard (2011) who conducted one of only few studies on backpackers and other individualist travellers, and Klenosky’s (2002) unique qualitative study on the push and pull factors of travellers. It was intended to pursue the exploration of long-term travellers’ motivation and help clarify how long-term travel affects their subjective wellbeing. There were two research questions: 1) Why do people travel long-term? and 2) How does long-term travel contribute to happiness? Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 participants using a purposive <b>sample.</b> <b>Interview</b> <b>transcripts</b> were triangulated to external sources (participants’ websites and blogs). Data were coded and analyzed in the NVivo qualitative software program using a mixture of intuitive and methodological (constant comparison) processes. FINDINGS: Findings revealed that old misconceptions surrounding long-term travel still exist. For example, misconceptions such as dated definitions, that this type of travel is best suited for single men, journey as an escape and as a way to achieve fame and glory) still persist. The current study contributes to existing findings by shedding a new light on what long-term travel is, why long-term travellers prefer the road to the modern Western lifestyle, and how the journey enriches their lives. The study highlights the pursuit of freedom and personal growth, open-mindedness to the world and its incredible diversity, and a life path for a self-fulfilling life. CONCLUSION: Although long-term travellers represent a marginal percentage {{of the total number of}} travellers worldwide, their impact is nevertheless significant, particularly in rural areas and developing countries. Long-term travellers are more likely to travel to remote areas than the mainstream tourists, they are more willing to endure hardship, and they spend more time travelling than any other types of travellers. Findings on this utopian alternative to the modern Western life increase our understanding of travel and, maybe most importantly, on humankind’s pursuit of happiness.

Easing the transition from military to civilian life has become a priority for the Department of Defense, yet there is a significant gap in empirical knowledge regarding the potential benefits of a college degree on soldiers exiting the military. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the lived experiences of Army Medics who have transitioned back into civilian life after graduating from a college degree program that grants significant credit for military training. This phenomenological study used a conceptual framework derived from Schlossbergâ??s adult transition theory. Data were collected from a focus group, semi-structured interviews, and interviewer notes. Seven participants were identified through purposive <b>sampling.</b> <b>Interview</b> <b>transcripts</b> and interviewer notes were analyzed using the Van Kaam method and yielded 4 pre-transition and 6 transitional themes. Findings indicated that the participantsâ?? initial fears of the transition were replaced with higher perceptions of self-worth and confidence, which benefitted them as they assimilated back into civilian society. The implications for positive social change include informing the Department of Defense and policymakers who are supporting soldiers transitioning to civilian life about study participantsâ?? increased feelings of self-worth and confidence upon degree completion...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} multiple case {{study was to identify}} strategies community hospital leaders use to reduce frontline support employee turnover. The study population consisted of leaders of a community hospital in southeast Louisiana. The conceptual framework for this study is Kahn 2 ̆ 7 s model of employee engagement. Semistructured interviews were conducted with eight hospital leaders in southeast Louisiana who were selected through census <b>sampling.</b> <b>Interview</b> <b>transcripts</b> were analyzed and coded following Yin 2 ̆ 7 s case study analysis process. Methodological triangulation allowed for a comparison of the findings of the interviews with information derived from exit interviews and employee engagement survey results. Four themes emerged from the interviews and document review: leadership, hiring and onboarding strategies, pay and compensation, and organizational-related factors. Reducing turnover among frontline hospital support employees can positively affect the quality of care provided to patients, and improve the level of service provided by the hospital to the community it serves. Beyond increasing organizational efficiency, {{the findings of this study}} can contribute to social change benefits for employees as continued employment allows individuals to provide for themselves and their families...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Securing and {{managing}} finances for multicentre randomised controlled trials {{is a highly}} complex activity which is rarely considered in the research literature. This paper describes the process of financial negotiation {{and the impact of}} financial considerations in four UK multicentre trials. These trials had met, or were on schedule to meet, recruitment targets agreed with their public-sector funders. The trials were considered within a larger study examining factors which might be associated with trial recruitment (STEPS). Methods In-depth semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted in 2003 – 04 with 45 individuals with various responsibilities to one of the four trials. Interviewees were recruited through purposive and then snowball <b>sampling.</b> <b>Interview</b> <b>transcripts</b> were analysed {{with the assistance of the}} qualitative package Atlas-ti. Results The data suggest that the UK system of dividing funds into research, treatment and NHS support costs brought the trial teams into complicated negotiations with multiple funders. The divisions were somewhat malleable and the funding system was used differently in each trial. The fact that all funders had the potential to influence and shape the trials considered here was an important issue as the perspectives of applicants and funders could diverge. The extent and range of industry involvement in non-industry-led trials was striking. Three broad periods of financial work (foundation, maintenance, and resourcing completion) were identified. From development to completion of a trial, the trialists had to be resourceful and flexible, adapting to changing internal and external circumstances. In each period, trialists and collaborators could face changing costs and challenges. Each trial extended the recruitment period; three required funding extensions from MRC or HTA. Conclusion This study highlights complex financial aspects of planning and conducting trials, especially where multiple funders are involved. Recognition of the importance of financial stability and of the need for appropriate training in this area should be paralleled by further similar research with a broader range of trials, aimed at understanding and facilitating the conduct of clinical research. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{inspected}} a <b>sample</b> of 70 <b>interview</b> <b>transcripts</b> with Australian Aboriginal {{children to}} gain {{a sense of how}} frequently verbal shame responses were occurring in investigative interviews regarding alleged sexual abuse. Transcripts were examined to determine how children articulated shame, how interviewers reacted to these responses, and how shame related to children 2 ̆ 7 s accounts. Examination of frequencies revealed that verbal shame responses occurred in just over one-quarter of the interviews. One-way analyses of variance indicated that children who expressed shame within the interview spoke the same amount as children who did not express shame, however, they required more interviewer prompts before a disclosure was made. Interviews where children expressed shame also included a greater number of interviewer reminders compared to interviews without shame responses. Results emphasize the importance of interviewer awareness of shame, and also point to the value of reassurance, patience, and persistence with non-leading narrative prompting when interviewing children who express shame during discussions of sexual abuse...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} compared pregnant quitters' and non-quitters' {{accounts of}} how partners, {{family and friends}} influenced their smoking cessation attempts. Qualitative secondary data analysis was carried out on a purposive <b>sample</b> of motivational <b>interview</b> <b>transcripts</b> undertaken by research midwives with pregnant women as part of SmokeChange, a smoking cessation intervention. Interviews with all quitters in the intervention group (n = 12) were analysed comparatively with interviews from a matched sample of non-quitters (n = 12). The discourses of both revealed similarity in how their partners, family and friends influenced their cessation efforts: salient others were simultaneously perceived by both groups of women as providing drivers and barriers to quit attempts; close associates who smoked were often perceived to be as supportive as those who did not. However, women who quit smoking during pregnancy talked more about receiving active praise/encouragement {{than those who did}} not. While close associates {{play an important role in}} women's attempts to stop smoking during pregnancy, the support they provide varies; further research is needed to develop a better understanding of how key relationships help or hinder cessation during pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: In view of anecdotal {{evidence}} that points to {{variations in the}} ways that contemporary clinicians practice Chinese Medicine (CM), a study was undertaken to explore, identify, and analyze the styles of practice amongst a group of beginner acupuncturists in Australia. All participants in the study had been trained in the practice of Chinese Medicine rather than biomedicine. Design and methods: The study used a phenomenographic method to identify and map the group conceptions of practice from the extensive interview data. Differences between practice conceptions were identified in terms of the aim of the therapeutic encounter and the strategies used to achieve the aim. Practitioner–client roles and the characteristics of the clinical encounter were also noted and analyzed with respect to varying practice conceptions. Results and conclusions: Five major conceptions of practice were identified and discussed with respect to levels of complexity. It was argued that the more holistic and client-centered conceptions were better suited to contemporary practice in the West and were more beneficial in enabling practitioners to adapt culture-bound knowledge to contemporary health needs.

40|$|Through the {{exploration}} of the lived experiences, beliefs and values of instructional leaders, lead teachers and students in Finland, Germany and Canada, this study seeks to answer the question, “What factors contribute to the establishment of developmentally responsive, intellectually engaging middle level learning environments for early adolescents?” Provoked by current research emerging from the Canadian province of Manitoba calling for the transformation of middle level learning environments, leading, teaching and learning in the middle years are examined through the lens of Robinson’s (2011) “leadership dimensions,” Friesen’s (2009) effective instructional practices and Dweck’s (2008) “growth mindset. ” Consideration of these three research perspectives in the context of early adolescent learning and middle level learning environments, placed against an international backdrop, provides a previously undocumented perspective into this phenomenon. Aligning with a social constructivist, qualitative research paradigm, the research design for this study incorporates collective case study methodology, along with constructivist grounded theory methods of data analysis. Three case study narratives are used to share the rich stories of study participants in Finland, Germany and Canada, selected using maximum variation and intensity <b>sampling</b> techniques. <b>Interview</b> <b>transcript</b> data was coded using processes outlined in Charmaz’s (2006, 2012) constructivist grounded theory. A cross-case analysis yielded a conceptual framework, highlighting key factors that were found in the data to be significant in the establishment of developmentally responsive, intellectually engaging middle level learning environments. Although this study focuses on 12 schools in Finland, Germany and Canada, it informs the practice of all those working with early adolescent learners in middle level learning environments in all corners of the globe. Using the insight and practical wisdom shared by study participants as a catalyst to reflect on and question current practices related to leading, teaching and learning in middle years will provide educators and education systems around the world with the awareness needed to support the next generation of early adolescent learners...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Previous {{research}} regarding Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) has mainly adopted quantitative methodologies, {{in order}} to study the effectiveness of EIP services. Research studies which have explored service-users’ experiences of EIP services are small in number. This research aimed to explore service-users’ experiences of being in contact with an EIP service, its impact of their experience of psychosis and current life situation. Design: Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used to conduct an in-depth qualitative study of {{a small sample of}} EIP service-users, {{in order to}} explore their experiences of being in contact with the service. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight service-users who had been receiving a service from an EIP team {{for more than two years}} and were recruited using a purposive <b>sampling</b> method. Verbatim <b>interview</b> <b>transcripts</b> were analysed using IPA. Results: Five super-ordinate themes, developed from the analysis, are discussed under the headings: Stigma, Relationships, Understanding the experiences, Sense of agency and Impact on sense of self. Sub-themes of these super-ordinate themes are also discussed. Conclusions: The themes developed from the analysis were envisioned as representing an overarching theme of ‘A personal journey of recovery’, which was influenced by participants’ involvement with the EIP service. Clinical implications include the need for EIP services, as with other mental health services, to find ways to promote recovery and create opportunities for agency and control. Future research directions are also discussed...|$|R
