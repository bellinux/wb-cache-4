40|$|If {{development}} assistance targeted at specific sectors {{is not used}} as intended, aid {{is said to be}} fungible. While fungible aid is in general perceived as being less effective than aid used as specified, this has not been formally tested. This paper attempts at filling this gap and hence, tries to assess to what extent fungibility is something donors should be concerned about. Country-specific estimates of fungibility are obtained for 57 aid-recipient countries, suggesting that <b>sectoral</b> <b>aid</b> is indeed fungible on average. These estimates are then incorporated into an empirical model of aid and economic growth. I do not find any evidence of non-fungible <b>sectoral</b> <b>aid</b> working better than fungible aid. Then, I focus on <b>sectoral</b> <b>aid</b> to 'pro-poor' government expenditure sectors to assess the effect on infant mortality. While the results indicate that non-fungible aid is welfare improving, this is not robust to small changes in the specification. My results suggest that the concept of fungibility may be too narrow and should possibly not be the most central concern when aid is debated or given. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} aid fungibility of Japan's {{official development assistance}} (ODA) to Indonesia for the period 1973 to 1994. Aid fungibility, often known as switching of aid money into non-development purposes, {{is one of the}} most controversial issues that impinges upon the macroeconomic effectiveness of foreign aid. In this study Japan's foreign aid to Indonesia is analysed, since Indonesia is one of the largest recipients of Japan's aid, and also since Japan is the largest aid donor to Indonesia. Using the maximum likelihood cointegration econometric procedure and the error correction mechanism (ECM), the study analyses aid fungibility for non-development current expenditure, development expenditure and domestic revenue for Indonesia. The results indicate that none of Japan's total <b>sectoral</b> <b>aid,</b> other donors' total <b>sectoral</b> <b>aid,</b> and non-sectoral aid from all donors, leaks into non-development current expenditure or reduces domestic revenue. Hence, no evidence of aid fungibility at the aggregate level is found. The study further analyses aid fungibility at the sectoral level for four major sections, i. e. social services sector, economic services sector, production sector, and other sectors. The empirical results provide no evidence that Japan's aid to the social services and production sectors is fungible. However, Japan's aid to the economic services sectors and other sectors is fungible. Furthermore, other donors' <b>sectoral</b> <b>aid</b> to all four sectors is fungible. Also, there is diversion of resources into the other sectors from other three combined sectors, i. e. social services sector, economic services sector, and production sector. This suggests that Japan's aid to the economic services sector and other donors' <b>sectoral</b> <b>aid</b> to the social services sector, economic services sector, production sector, may diverge into the other sectors. This study concludes by speculating the importance of aid sources and sectors to which aid is allocated as some of the factors that explain aid fungibility in Indonesia...|$|E

Then I use a comprehensive panel data to show the relationships between conflicts/violence and sectoral foreign aid covering 123 developing countries from 2002 to 2010. It shows that agricultural aid can significantly reduce conflict, and aid for food security can significantly mitigate violence. Aid for some sectors will increase conflict/violence.

Traditionally, urban areas were favoured over rural ones. This better access to services is one of the drivers of urbanisation.

In the paper, cross country panel regressions are used to compare institutional factors like corruption and decentralisation as well as financing that might influence access to water and sanitation in rural versus urban areas.

The poverty situation and recent aid trends to Viet Nam suggest that there is an imbalance between aid that promotes economic growth and aid that directly targets the poor. The phenomenon is evident in both the <b>sectoral</b> <b>aid</b> disbursement and the disbursement by approach to poverty. Additionally, aid is not regionally directed in a manner conducive to poverty alleviation and is urban-biased.

40|$|Since {{opening its}} economy {{to the outside}} world in late 1978, China has {{experienced}} a massive, protracted, and unexpected economic upsurge, which has attracted the attention of a large and diverse group of researchers. China's three-decade economic reforms have reshaped the economic structure from plan to market, through a variety of policy actions, such as openness to foreign investment and efforts to build economic zones. Economic growth and potential technology transfer are indeed the main rationale behind the Chinese government's aggressive efforts {{over the past three decades}} to enhance openness and to increase domestic competition. This dissertation consists of three chapters. All chapters study firm behavior and their policy implications. However, the focus of each chapter is different. The first chapter (coauthored with Ann Harrison and Gary Jefferson) studies how institutions affect productivity spillovers from foreign direct investment (FDI) to China's domestic industrial enterprises. The second chapter separates the effect of agglomeration economies on firm performance (measured by total factor productivity) from the impact of competition and better transport infrastructure. The third chapter (coauthored with Philippe Aghion, Mathias Dewatripont, Ann Harrison, Patrick Legros) tests for the complementarity between competition and industrial policy. The first Chapter (co-authored with Ann Harrison and Gary Jefferson) investigates how institutions affect productivity spillovers from foreign direct investment (FDI) to China's domestic industrial enterprises during 1998 - 2007. We examine three institutional features that comprise aspects of China's "special characteristics": (1) the different sources of FDI, where FDI is nearly evenly divided between mostly Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and Hong Kong (SAR of China), Taiwan (China), and Macau (SAR of China); (2) China's heterogeneous ownership structure, involving state- (SOEs) and non-state owned (non-SOEs) enterprises, firms with foreign equity participation, and non-SOE, domestic firms; and (3) industrial promotion via tariffs or through tax holidays to foreign direct investment. We also explore how productivity spillovers from FDI changed with China's entry into the WTO in late 2001. We find robust positive and significant spillovers to domestic firms via backward linkages (the contacts between foreign buyers and local suppliers). Our results suggest varied success with industrial promotion policies. Final goods tariffs as well as input tariffs are negatively associated with firm-level productivity. However, we find that productivity spillovers were higher from foreign firms that paid less than the statutory corporate tax rate. The second chapter separates the effect of agglomeration economies on firm performance (measured by total factor productivity) from the impact of competition and better transport infrastructure. Consequently, this paper primarily addresses the problem of omitted variable bias in estimating the impact of agglomeration economies on firm performance. The results suggest that firm productivity is improved only by the presence of other firms in the same sector (localization economies). The inclusion of information on road construction does not affect the importance of pure localization economies. However, including a measure of competition in the estimation significantly reduces the importance of localization externalities. The results also suggest that both road-building and competition are positively associated with productivity growth. The results for sub-samples indicate that exporting firms and firms financed by foreign investment benefit more from localization externalities than do their non-exporting and domestically-financed counterparts. The third chapter (co-authored with Philippe Aghion, Ann Harrison, Mathias Dewatripont, and Patrick Legros) argues that <b>sectoral</b> state <b>aid</b> tends to foster productivity, productivity growth, and product innovation to a larger extent when it targets more competitive sectors and when it is not concentrated on one or a small number of firms in the sector. A main implication from our analysis is that the debate on industrial policy should no longer be for or against having such a policy. As it turns out, sectoral policies are being implemented in one form or another by a large number of countries worldwide, starting with China. Rather, the issue should be on how to design and govern sectoral policies in order to make them more competition-friendly and therefore more growth-enhancing. Our analysis suggests that proper selection criteria together with good guidelines for governing sectoral support can make a significant difference in terms of growth and innovation performance. Yet the issue remains of how to minimize the scope for influence activities by sectoral interests when a <b>sectoral</b> state <b>aid</b> policy is to be implemented. One answer is that the less concentrated and more competition-compatible the allocation of state aid to a sector, the less firms in that sector will lobby for that aid as they will anticipate lower profits from it. In other words, political economy considerations should reinforce the interaction between competition and the efficiency of <b>sectoral</b> state <b>aid.</b> A comprehensive analysis of the optimal governance of sectoral policies still awaits further research...|$|R

40|$|THE ISSUE Industrial {{policy has}} a bad name: ‘picking winners ’ and thus {{distorting}} competition, while exposing government to capture by vested interests. But there are reasons for a rethink. First, climate change: without government intervention to jump-start massive private investment in clean technologies, governments, by default, encourage investment in dirtier technologies. Second, a new post-crisis realism: laissez-faire complacency by many governments has led to mis-investment in the non-tradable sector {{at the expense of}} growth-rich tradables. Third, China – and some other emerging economies – are big deployers of growth-enhancing sectoral policies. The challenge for Europe is how it can design and govern sectoral policies that are competition-friendly and thus growth-enhancing.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the paper {{is to provide a}} {{quantitative}} and qualitative analy-sis of state aid policy and its role in ensuring economic development in the EU. Based on theoretical approaches and empirical evidence, it is assumed that an effi-cient state aid policy should support the macroeconomic stabilization and the eco-nomic development. Therefore an econometric model is proposed to evaluate and quantify the relation between the level of horizontal aid and the value of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity standard. According to the results of the analysis, important disparities can be identified in analyzing the correlation between the two indicators mentioned above, deficitary to several EU member states, suggesting the necessity of a better coordination in the economic policies. Thus, one of the most relevant conclusions is that while the gen-eral objective of reducing state aid level is mainly achieved since the early 1990 s, a redirection of state aid towards horizontal objectives can be observed beginning with 2000 and is still ongoing at present with important consequences for the general economic development of the EU member states. competition policy, state aid, horizontal aid, <b>sectoral</b> <b>aid,</b> economic growth and development...|$|E

However, achieving this target remains a major challenge for sub-Saharan Africa, while the ability of governments to expand access is constrained by limited financial resources.

We specifically examine whether <b>sectoral</b> allocation of <b>aid</b> has an impact on access to water and sanitation. The analysis is based on panel data estimation techniques controlling for country specific effects and potential endogeneity of regressors.

Overall, while some MDGs, e. g., the fight against HIV/AIDS, have shaped the allocation of aid, the sector-specific results reveal that with respect to other MDGs, most notably primary education, there is a considerable gap between donor rhetoric and actual aid allocation. These results invite the conclusion that the current focus on substantially increasing aid in order to turn the tide in trying to achieve the MDGs misses one important point: Unless the targeting of aid is improved, higher aid will not have the desired effects.

Unfortunately, most of these countries, especially the African countries are characterized by multiple problems such as bad leadership and governance, mismanagement and corruption, debt crisis, insufficient and poor infrastructure, chronic poverty etc.; and all these problems have continued to make nonsense of foreign aid’s judicious and optimal utilization and impact on their economies. However, considering the position and role of IDB over the years in the global economic development; this paper examined the developmental activities of IDB in Africa and some of the challenges for sustainable development.

This competence is unique to the European Community [...] giving power to the Community to regulate national and regional industrial policy. This area is of interest to lawyers, political scientists, and economists. Recent and current high profile cases in the airline and banking sectors have raised awareness of this under-researched area. DG-IV has increasingly relied on a strategy of producing communications and frameworks to impose legal coherence in the control of State Aid, but these are at present of dubious legal effect, and have themselves been challenged before the Community Courts.

From the practical point of view, therefore, if the Commission is to use "legislative-type" instruments, as distinguished from mere statements of policy, and encourage those with which it deals to rely on them, there must be the confidence that these will survive legal challenge. However, the subject of this paper raises broader issues than the control of State aid, important though this is. The accordance of a legally binding effect to some of these <b>sectoral</b> <b>aid</b> disciplines constitutes a source of law which has only comparatively recently been recognised as a source of legal obligation.

40|$|The {{prospects}} for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) look bad in various developing countries, notably in Sub-Saharan Africa. To turn the tide, recent reports by the UN Millennium Project and the Commission for Africa issued urgent calls to increase official development aid substantially and, thereby, {{close the gap}} between donor rhetoric and reality. Qualitative aspects of aid allocation have received considerably less attention even though they may be as important for effectively meeting recipient needs. In particular, a needs-based targeting of aid in priority sectors such as health and education should have an important say on whether donors help achieving the MDGs. Hence, in addition to the usual ranking of donors according to their overall 'generosity', the structure of aid portfolios offers interesting insights as to whether aid has been prioritised in line with the MDGs. The <b>sectoral</b> composition of <b>aid</b> by all donors taken together has changed quite dramatically since the early 1990 s.

40|$|This paper investigates {{by means}} of {{advanced}} panel data techniques whether bilateral aid {{has been successful in}} promoting bilateral exports to recipient countries during the period 1988 – 2007 and to what extent changes in aid policies have influenced this relationship. The main novelty of this research is the distinction between tied and untied aid in a multi-donor gravity model of trade and the comparison between trade and aid policies in this setting. We find an average positive effect of bilateral aid on exports, which varies over time and across donors and which appears to depend {{on the extent to which}} donors tied aid to exports. The effect does appear to have decreased substantially over the period studied and it is even not statistically significant in the 2000 s, which could suggest that the recommendations given by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) concerning the untying of aid and aid allocation have been followed by the donors and led to declining impacts on their exports. Interestingly, these decreasing aid-elasticities are accompanied by increasing coefficients of the regional trade agreement variable, which is positive and statistically significant after 1994. Finally, we find that the strength of the relationship between exports and bilateral aid is correlated with the extent to which aid is tied and partially related to the <b>sectoral</b> allocation of <b>aid...</b>|$|R
40|$|If a donor gives aid for {{a project}} that the {{recipient}} government would have undertaken anyway, the aid finances expenditures other than the intended project. The notion that aid in this sense may be"fungible"has recently received empirical support. The authors look at why aid isfungible or nonfungible, {{and the extent to}} which it is fungible in Sub-Saharan Africa. Their results suggest that aid may be partially fungible in Africa and suggests some reasons. They find relatively little evidence that aid leads to greater tax relief in Africa. Every dollar of aid leads to a 90 -cent increase in government spending. The implications of this result are by no means clear. If the marginal cost of taxation is exceptionally high - which it might be in African countries - using aid for tax relief may be the best use of foreign resources. Aid's effect on the composition of current and capital spending? They increase equally. Even if all aid were intended to finance capital spending, the reallocation to current spending might not necessarily be harmful. The fungible of loans to specific sectors generally mirrors patterns found in a broader sample of countries. Aid to energy, transport, and communication sectors increase public spending in those sectors somewhat but by no means one for one. (By contrast, in the worldwide sample, aid to transport and communications was almost fully nonfungible). Aid to the education sector - which had no discernible effect on education spending in the global sample - had an almost one-for-one effect on education spending in Africa. Even in these partially fungible sectors, governments spend more out of aid resources than they do out of their own resources, at the margin. Governments do not spend all <b>sectoral</b> <b>aid</b> in that sector - nor do they treat such aid as merely budgetary support. The more donors to a country, the more likely aids is to be fungible. If the number of donors represents a proxy for monitoring costs, it is not surprising that most aid is partly fungible.

40|$|Entrepreneurship {{is a vital}} {{component}} of economic development through innovation, job creation and efficient allocation of resources. Hence, many governments play a proactive role in facilitating entry of new firms and nourishing an entrepreneurial culture. These objectives became more relevant in recent years since fostering entrepreneurship is viewed as the cure to the global economic slowdown. This thesis addresses an essential but neglected aspect of entrepreneurship development: the impact of capital flows {{in the form of}} FDI and foreign aid on domestic firm creation. What is common to FDI and aid is that capital, skills, technological and organizational know-how move across national boundaries, altering the balance of local resources available to prospective entrepreneurs. In Chapter 2, we exploit cross-country and cross-country-industry variation over time in FDI via M&A and entrepreneurship. Results suggest that adverse effects of FDI counterbalance positive spillovers, leaving the net impact on entrepreneurship negative—though it is economically very small—both at the aggregate and industry level. Nascent entrepreneurship is affected the most by FDI, with the size of the negative effect decreasing as new firms advance in age. In the literature, heightened competition ensuing FDI is documented as the main cause of crowding-out of domestic firms. Chapter 3 thus takes a step towards understanding factors governing the FDI-entrepreneurship nexus of which we consider industry competition (concentration) and wages. We find that FDI is positively associated with both elements in Dutch manufacturing industries, which translates into increases and reductions in entry rates, respectively. This suggests that lucrative rents in concentrated markets are accessible to both foreign and domestic firms. Findings also imply that higher industry wages attract would-be entrepreneurs into wage-employment rather than pursuing a career as a new venture owner. Once the channel effects are isolated, there is no direct relationship between FDI and Dutch firm entry. Chapter 4 considers the role of industry linkages between foreign and indigenous companies in entrepreneurship development in Turkey. We contend that increased demand of foreign firms for local inputs (backward linkages) and the availability of new goods and services introduced by foreign suppliers (forward linkages) stimulate domestic firm entry. While entrepreneurship is unresponsive to backward and horizontal linkages, industries with large forward linkages with foreign firms accommodate more new businesses. Foreign firms’ high import propensities and improvements in the competitive position of Turkish firms provide an intuitive explanation for the lack of FDI effects via backward and horizontal linkages, respectively. Foreign aid is complementary to FDI in countries where investors show little interest due to the risky economic environment. Therefore, sizable aid flows are channelled into areas deemed important for unleashing the entrepreneurial potential of the poor. Specifically, in Chapter 5, we argue that purpose-specific aid targeted at education, physical infrastructure and institutional reforms are of central concern to entrepreneurship in aid-receiving countries. Aid has a positive association with entrepreneurship but only at the aggregate level with no discernible impact of <b>sectoral</b> <b>aid.</b> This supports the idea that the fungibility of aid flows plays a role in the results...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{participation}} now occupies {{pride of place}} in forestry planning, and has become the key to redefining policy. Yet it can only work under certain conditions: there have to be responsible attitudes on the part of participants, mutual exchange of information between them, commitment by public bodies, an independent role for facilitators, and a rigorous approach. Most forestry policies which are currently being revisited in developing countries claim to be based on bringing together the interest groups that represent the various users of the forest. Just as in other sectors of society, the notion of participation has come to dominate thinking on planning. It is a real novelty in the forestry world, long accustomed to the State taking decisions without any consultation. In forestry, a long term vision is needed with regard to public intervention, and strategic planning has an essential role to play. Participation thrust its way onto the stage in developing countries during the 1980 s, following criticism of the ineffectiveness of State systems to slow down the degradation of forest resources. When studies showed the importance of the forest for local communities, the idea was born to involve them in forestry management as a way to improve protection. Coupled to this was the need to involve the representatives of various interests in the formulation of corresponding political and planning options. Several approaches found favour, varying according to the country and the international agencies backing them. In the beginning, the type of participation practised was passive, with representatives of interest groups being involved solely to be informed about options, or to provide information to the State on what it could do. In time, this attitude gradually made way for real, active involvement respecting the opinions of each party, and negotiating a compromise on objectives and means between often antagonistic positions. Slowly, pluralism was accepted in administrative bodies which had been unwilling to listen to the points of view of forest users suspected of degrading forest resources rather than maintaining them. Now the tables have turned and today one of the key conditions of leading international donor agencies is, alongside an emphasis on training, that there must be a participatory process of drawing up national forestry policies and programmes. The 'mixed model' is a complex procedure, which has been used in several ACP countries. It involves organising on a nationwide basis a massive process of consultation, discussion and negotiation from bottom to top on forestry problems, on how to resolve them and on how to permit stakeholders to assume their proper responsibilities. There are rounds of consultations to arrive at a common diagnosis of the present situation, to agree on objectives to be met, to elaborate implementation strategies and related priorities. Series of regional, then national, workshops are held so that all participants can state their preferences, debate them in public and then negotiate a compromise acceptable to all parties. The forest service plays a central technical role in the discussion, but it is only a non-majority stakeholder. This process, when conducted with due rigour, can help a State to affirm its independence in decision-making and to avoid having to follow international prescriptions. The extent to which this type of direct democracy is effective depends on many factors. Firstly, {{there has to be a}} free and full flow of information between participants, which is not always the case since holding back information can be used as a way to maintain power. Participants also have to be able to properly represent real social issues, and to avoid restricting themselves to promoting their own representativeness. Further, facilitators have to have the utmost neutrality. Finally, there must be a clear commitment on the part of the public authorities to put into practice the decisions arising from the process, not normally an easy task since most of them entail expenditure. Furthermore, there is a risk involved in the withdrawal of the State and international donor agencies from forestry development. At a time when <b>sectoral</b> <b>aid</b> is falling fast and the means of central administrations are restricted, arranging the participation of stakeholders can be a way to pull out of the sector and to leave local stakeholders to fend for themselves alone. Forestry development would not be any the better for such an approach. To involve interest groups in decisions about forestry policy is a good thing. But it has to be a reasoned choice, arrived at on the basis of methods and techniques proper to democracy. Negotiation has to be taken and conducted seriously, with the rigour necessary for respecting the sincerity of all participants. Only then can the resulting decisions be sure of having optimal effectiveness, and equity.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the potential fungibility of foreign {{assistance to the}} Government of Nepal using two methods: an econometric model and a modified ORANI-G, a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. I use the econometric model to corroborate {{the findings of the}} CGE model and to determine whether such a model can produce credible empirical evidence on aid fungibility. Both models indicate presence of general and categorical fungibility, and non-additionality in the use of aid in Nepal. I begin with a partial equilibrium econometric model to estimate government expenditures using a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR). At the <b>sectoral</b> level, categorical <b>aid</b> is prone to reshuffling generating overall negative development investments in most of the sectors. At the aggregate level, a unit of aid produces a meagre 0. 33 units of additional development expenditures in the Nepalese government budget. In addition, aid partially finances non-development expenditures, but only slightly enhances the governments’ own revenue effort. Next, I utilize the ORANI-G model with a Klein-Rubin functional form for government behaviour, rigidities in the labour market, and some additional parameters to study aid fungibility in Nepal. This produces results that are analogous to the econometric model. Foreign assistance to Nepal exhibits a high level of general and categorical fungibility, with an insignificant increase in revenue collection. Overall, a unit of aid stimulates only a 0. 45 units of additional development expenditures in the Nepalese government budget. In using the CGE model to study fungibility, this thesis develops a new method of analyzing the research question whereas, previous studies use models in a partial equilibrium setting, failing to account for decision-making processes of the government. This thesis is an attempt to expand on the existing literature by introducing CGE models in the study of aid fungibility and to motivate further study into fungibility using CGE modelling...|$|R
