25|$|In this configuration, the {{application}} makes {{calls to the}} Btrieve API, or Microkernel Interface (WBTRV32.DLL). The call is then processed by the interface and passed to the MKDE (W32MKDE.EXE) which uses the underlying operating <b>system</b> <b>file</b> system (whether it be network or local) to directly access the database files.|$|E
25|$|On 25 November 2010, NAB {{suffered}} a system malfunction {{resulting in the}} failure of accounts processing. As a result, around 60,000 banking transactions were lost, {{and had to be}} manually recovered. The malfunction was caused by a corruption of an irreplaceable <b>system</b> <b>file.</b> This issue has been dubbed by some commentators as one of the biggest failures {{in the history of the}} Australian banking system.|$|E

25|$|If a file {{has been}} {{infected}} {{by a computer}} virus, anti-virus software will attempt to remove the virus code from the file during disinfection, {{but it is not}} always able to restore the file to its undamaged state. In such circumstances, damaged files can only be restored from existing backups or shadow copies (this is also true for ransomware); installed software that is damaged requires re-installation (however, see <b>System</b> <b>File</b> Checker).|$|E
25|$|On September 14, 2000, Microsoft {{released}} Windows ME (Millennium Edition), {{the last}} DOS-based version of Windows. Windows ME incorporated visual interface enhancements from its Windows NT-based counterpart Windows 2000, had faster boot times than previous versions (which however, required {{the removal of}} the ability to access a real mode DOS environment, removing compatibility with some older programs), expanded multimedia functionality (including Windows Media Player 7, Windows Movie Maker, and the Windows Image Acquisition framework for retrieving images from scanners and digital cameras), additional system utilities such as <b>System</b> <b>File</b> Protection and System Restore, and updated home networking tools. However, Windows ME was faced with criticism for its speed and instability, along with hardware compatibility issues and its removal of real mode DOS support. PC World considered Windows ME {{to be one of the}} worst operating systems Microsoft had ever released, and the 4th worst tech product of all time.|$|E
25|$|Systems {{that use}} {{passwords}} for authentication {{must have some}} way to check any password entered to gain access. If the valid passwords are simply stored in a <b>system</b> <b>file</b> or database, an attacker who gains sufficient access to the system will obtain all user passwords, giving the attacker access to all accounts on the attacked system, and possibly other systems where users employ the same or similar passwords. One way to reduce this risk is to store only a cryptographic hash of each password instead of the password itself. Standard cryptographic hashes, such as the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) series, are very hard to reverse, so an attacker who gets hold of the hash value cannot directly recover the password. However, knowledge of the hash value lets the attacker quickly test guesses offline. Password cracking programs are widely available that will test {{a large number of}} trial passwords against a purloined cryptographic hash.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} User Mode <b>File</b> <b>System</b> (FUSE)-based <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> for Unix-like {{operating}} systems (Linux, etc.) {{that can be}} used to mount an S3 bucket as a <b>file</b> <b>system.</b> Note that as the semantics of the S3 <b>file</b> <b>system</b> are not that of a Posix <b>file</b> <b>system,</b> the <b>file</b> <b>system</b> may not behave entirely as expected.|$|R
5000|$|Specific {{example of}} <b>system</b> <b>files</b> include the files with [...] {{filename}} extension in MS-DOS. In Windows NT family, the <b>system</b> <b>files</b> are mainly under the folder [...] In the Mac OS {{they are in}} the System suitcase. And in Linux <b>system</b> the <b>system</b> <b>files</b> are located under folders [...] (the kernel itself), [...] (system utilities) and [...] (kernel device drivers).|$|R
5000|$|Use default {{settings}}. Default {{settings are}} defined per <b>file</b> <b>system</b> at the <b>file</b> <b>system</b> level. For ext3 <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> {{these can be}} set with the tune2fs command. The normal default for Ext3 <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> is equivalent to (no acl support). Modern Red Hat based systems set acl support as default on the root <b>file</b> <b>system</b> but not on user created Ext3 <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> Some <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> such as XFS enable acls by default. Default <b>file</b> <b>system</b> mount attributes can be overridden in /etc/fstab.|$|R
2500|$|Windows 2000 is {{the first}} Windows to support {{hibernation}} at the operating system level (OS-controlled ACPI S4 sleep state) without special drivers from the hardware manufacturer. A hidden <b>system</b> <b>file</b> named [...] "hiberfil.sys" [...] in {{the root of the}} boot partition is used to store the contents of RAM when the computer hibernates. In Windows 2000, this file is as big as the total RAM installed.|$|E
2500|$|Devices with 512MB of RAM or less report {{themselves}} as [...] "low RAM" [...] devices. Using an API, apps may detect low RAM devices and modify their functionality accordingly. KitKat also supports zram. WebView components were updated to utilize {{a version of}} the Google Chrome rendering engine. A new Storage Access Framework API allows apps to retrieve files in a consistent manner; as part of the framework, a new <b>system</b> <b>file</b> picker allows users to access files from various sources (including those exposed by apps, such as online storage services).|$|E
2500|$|System 7.1 {{is mainly}} a bugfix release, {{with a few}} minor {{features}} added. System 7.1 {{is not only the}} first Macintosh operating system to cost money (all previous versions were free or sold at the cost of the floppies), but also received a [...] "Pro" [...] sibling (version 7.1.1) with extra features. System 7.1.2 was the first version to support PowerPC-based Macs. System 7.1 also introduces the System Enablers as a method to support new models without updating the actual <b>System</b> <b>file.</b> This leads to extra files inside the system folder (one per new model supported).|$|E
40|$|From its inception, UNIX {{has been}} built around two {{fundamental}} entities: processes and files. In this chapter, {{we look at the}} implementation of files in Solaris and discuss the framework for <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> 14. 1 <b>File</b> <b>System</b> Framework Solaris OS includes a framework, the virtual <b>file</b> <b>system</b> framework, under which multiple <b>file</b> <b>system</b> types are implemented. Earlier implementations of UNIX used a single <b>file</b> <b>system</b> type for all of the mounted <b>file</b> <b>systems,</b> typically, the UFS <b>file</b> <b>system</b> from BSD UNIX. The virtual <b>file</b> <b>system</b> framework was developed to allow Sunâ€™s distributed computing <b>file</b> <b>system</b> (NFS) to coexist with the UFS <b>file</b> <b>system</b> in SunOS 2. 0; it became a standard part of System V in SVR 4 and Solaris OS. We can categorize Solaris <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> into the following types: Storage-based. Regular <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> that provide facilities for persistent storage and management of data. The Solaris UFS and PC/DOS <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> are examples. Network <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>File</b> <b>systems</b> that provide <b>files</b> that are accessible in a local directory structure but are stored on a remote network server; for example, NFS. Pseudo <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>File</b> <b>systems</b> that present various abstractions as files in a <b>file</b> <b>system.</b> The /proc pseudo <b>file</b> <b>system</b> represents the address space of a process as a series of files. 657 658 Chapter 14 <b>File</b> <b>System</b> Framework The framework provides a single set of well-defined interfaces that are <b>file</b> <b>system</b> independent; the implementation details of each <b>file</b> <b>system</b> are hidden behind these interfaces. Two key objects represent these interfaces: the virtual file, or vnode, and the virtual <b>file</b> <b>system,</b> or vfs objects. The vnode interfaces implement file-related functions, and the vfs interfaces implement <b>file</b> <b>system</b> management functions. The vnode and vfs interfaces direct functions to specific <b>file</b> <b>systems,</b> {{depending on the type of}} <b>file</b> <b>system</b> being operated on. Figure 14. 1 shows the <b>file</b> <b>system</b> layers. File-related functions are initiated through a system call or from another kernel subsystem and are directed to the appropriate <b>file</b> <b>system</b> by the vnode/vfs layer...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} an architecture for extensible <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> The architecture enables {{the extension of}} <b>file</b> <b>system</b> functionality by composing (or stacking) new <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> on top of existing <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> A <b>file</b> <b>system</b> that is stacked {{on top of an}} existing <b>file</b> <b>system</b> can access the existing <b>file</b> <b>system's</b> <b>files</b> via a well-defined naming interface and can share the same underlying file data in a coherent manner. We describe extending <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> {{in the context of the}} Spring operating <b>system.</b> Composing <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> in Spring is facilitated by basic Spring features such as its virtual memory architecture, its strongly-typed well-defined interfaces, its location-independent object invocation mechanism, and its flexible naming architecture. <b>File</b> <b>systems</b> in Spring can reside in the kernel, in user-mode, or on remote machines, and composing them can be done in a very flexible manner...|$|R
5000|$|<b>System</b> <b>File</b> Protection: First {{introduced}} with Windows 2000 (as Windows File Protection), {{and expanding}} on the capabilities introduced with <b>System</b> <b>File</b> Checker in Windows 98, <b>System</b> <b>File</b> Protection aimed to protect system files from modification and corruption silently and automatically. When the file protection is in effect, replacing or deleting a <b>system</b> <b>file</b> causes Windows ME to silently restore the original copy. The original {{is taken from}} a hard drive backup folder (...) or from the Windows ME installation CD, if the cached copy of files on the hard disk has been deleted. If no installation CD is in the drive, a dialog box alerts the user about the problem and requests that the CD be inserted. <b>System</b> <b>File</b> Protection is a different technology from System Restore {{and should not be}} confused with the latter. System Restore maintains a broad set of changed files including added applications and user configuration data stored repeatedly at specific points in time restored by the user, whereas <b>System</b> <b>File</b> Protection protects operating system files with no user input.|$|E
50|$|The mode {{appears on}} the main menu after the player saves into the <b>system</b> <b>file</b> for the first time. It allows the player to browse through the {{different}} items the <b>system</b> <b>file</b> has collected by visiting various locations in a limited area, similar to adventure mode, with each place having a particular use.|$|E
50|$|<b>System</b> <b>File</b> Checker checks {{installed}} {{versions of}} system files {{to ensure they}} were the same version as the one installed with Windows 98 or newer. Corrupt or older versions are replaced by the correct versions. This tool was introduced to resolve the DLL hell issue and was replaced in Windows ME by <b>System</b> <b>File</b> Protection.|$|E
50|$|The actual name is the Logic Information <b>Systems</b> <b>File</b> <b>System,</b> and is {{abbreviated}} LISFS {{to avoid}} confusion with the log-structured <b>file</b> <b>system</b> (LFS). An {{implementation of the}} Logic <b>File</b> <b>System</b> {{is available at the}} LISFS website.|$|R
50|$|Distributed <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> can be {{optimized}} for different purposes. Some, {{such as those}} designed for internet services, including GFS, are {{optimized for}} scalability. Other designs for distributed <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> support performance-0intensive applications usually executed in parallel. Some examples include: MapR <b>File</b> <b>System</b> (MapR-FS), Ceph-FS, Fraunhofer <b>File</b> <b>System</b> (BeeGFS), Lustre <b>File</b> <b>System,</b> IBM General Parallel <b>File</b> <b>System</b> (GPFS), and Parallel Virtual <b>File</b> <b>System.</b>|$|R

50|$|Bitmapped fonts {{were stored}} as {{resources}} within the <b>System</b> <b>file.</b> An utility called Font/DA Mover {{was used to}} install fonts into or extract fonts out of the <b>System</b> <b>file.</b> Fonts could also be embedded into Macintosh applications and other file types, such as a HyperCard stack. Fonts that were not being used were stored in a suitcase file.|$|E
