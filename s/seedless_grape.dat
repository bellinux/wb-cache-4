5|$|Thomcord grape is {{a hybrid}} of Thompson <b>Seedless</b> <b>grape</b> (Vitis vinifera, or Sultanina), which is popular in {{supermarkets}} during the summer, and seeded Concord grape (Vitis labrusca), commonly used to make grape juice and jelly. It is a plump, juicy, seedless table grape and is slightly firmer than Concord. Thomcord has a blue-black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom. Unlike Concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, Thomcord has a more edible skin that clings to the flesh, much like Thompson Seedless. It has an aromatic flavor, similar to the Concord in taste ("labrusca"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from Thompson Seedless.|$|E

500|$|The {{earthquake}} {{occurred at}} 02:58UTC (7:28a.m. Iran Standard Time), {{while many of}} the estimated 60 million Iranians affected were in their homes. Its duration was seven seconds, and the epicenter was near the settlement of Bou'in-Zahra in the Khar river valley, a mountainous farming region about [...] from the provincial capital of Qazvin. The greatest damage was across an area best known for its <b>seedless</b> <b>grape</b> harvesting, a getaway for wealthy residents of Tehran. At least 261 people were killed, 1,500 injured, and 25,000 left homeless. An earlier death toll was reported as 500, but this number was believed to be inflated once it became known that some of the severely injured had been mistaken for dead. Most of the dead were women, children and the elderly, as many of the men were working in local vineyards. Over 20 aftershocks were recorded, with magnitudes up to 5.1 on the moment magnitude scale. At least three of these caused further casualties and damage, most of which were within a [...] radius of the main shock.|$|E
50|$|The {{fruit of}} <b>seedless</b> <b>grapes</b> {{is smaller than}} normal because seeds produce the plant hormone gibberellin, which causes fruit enlargement. Most {{commercial}} <b>seedless</b> <b>grapes</b> are sprayed with gibberellin to {{increase the size of}} the fruit and also to make the fruit clusters less tightly packed. A new cultivar, 'Melissa', has naturally larger fruit so does not require gibberellin sprays.|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} {{sources of the}} {{seedlessness}} trait, and essentially all commercial cultivators get it from one of three sources: Thompson Seedless, Russian Seedless, and Black Monukka, all being cultivars of Vitis vinifera. There are currently {{more than a dozen}} varieties of <b>seedless</b> <b>grapes.</b> Several, such as Einset Seedless, Benjamin Gunnels's Prime <b>seedless</b> <b>grapes,</b> Reliance, and Venus, have been specifically cultivated for hardiness and quality in the relatively cold climates of northeastern United States and southern Ontario.|$|R
2500|$|In South Africa, Muscat of Alexandria {{is known}} as [...] "Hanepoot" [...] and was the fourth-most widely planted white wine grape variety in the country until the early 2000s. While some of the plantings were used for wine production, {{particularly}} for fortified wine, many plantings {{were used for the}} production of grape concentrate and raisins. In California, there is still more plantings of Muscat of Alexandria than any other Muscat variety, with most of these grapes going into anonymous jug wines from the Central Valley. As in many other places in the world, the grape had a long history of use in the United States as a raisin variety, though in the 1920s, plantings of Muscat of Alexandria began to decline as producers turned to more popular <b>seedless</b> <b>grape</b> varieties.|$|E

The science of our time has attacked but a little department of the field of human disease, but even so, it spreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number to fight out a balance as they can. We improve our favourite plants and animals--and how few they are--gradually by selective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a <b>seedless</b> <b>grape,</b> now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient breed of cattle. We improve them gradually, because our ideals are vague and tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands. Some day all this will be better organized, and still better. That is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature. In the end, wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit our human needs.|$|E

40|$|The major {{objective}} of this project is to develop techniques to produce <b>seedless</b> Kyoho <b>grape</b> to improve its competitive ability {{and to develop a}} suitable culture system for the Kyoho seedless mutant to increase the possibility of commercializing this mutant. DNA molecular markers can be used as an early selection tool for hybrid progeny which will improve breeding efficiency and reduce the breeding cost. This study will develop a seedless-linked marker for Kyoho-related cultivars which will be very helpful for tetraploid grape breeding. The main works in the 98 fiscal year include: 1. Development of technique to induce seedlessness in Kyoho <b>grapes.</b> Induced <b>seedless</b> Kyoho <b>grape</b> will benefit farmers and the grape industry 2. Berry enlargement of <b>seedless</b> <b>grapes</b> and the <b>seedless</b> Kyoho mutant by plant growth regulators. 3. Searching molecular markers linked to the seedless trait in the seedless Kyoho mutant. The marker will be very helpful for new <b>seedless</b> Kyoho line <b>grape</b> breeding. 4. Breeding new triploid <b>seedless</b> <b>grapes.</b> Another major {{objective of}} this project is to develop a girlding method to improve berry quality of Kyoho grapevine. Rootstocks have remarkable effects on vine growth and berry production, as well as berry coloration and quality. As observed in the vineyard, some rootstock scion combinations, e. g. Kyoho on 1202, produced high yeild and large berries with poor color under double cropping system in Taiwan's warm subtropical climate. Previous results indicated that girdling can improve berry color of the summer crop in Kyoho for double cropping system. The effect is likely variable among different rootstock scion combinations. The main works include: 1) to identify the effects of differnet rootstock/scion combinations on grape berry growth and quality. 2) {{to examine the effects of}} girdling on fruit coloration and quality under different rootstock/scion combinations and to evaluate the potential of girdling treatment in the double cropping system in Taiwan's subtropical climate. 3) to develop the best girdling procedule and the best rootstock/scion combination for the application of girdling. 本計畫主要目的為開發巨峰葡萄無子化之技術，增進國產巨峰葡萄之競爭力。也將針對巨峰無子變異株建立一適當栽培模式以增加其經濟栽培之可行性，以增加其經濟栽培之可行性。DNA分子標誌可以作為雜交後代早期選拔的工具，增加育種的效率並節省大量育種成本，本研究計畫將開發巨峰系葡萄無子性狀連鎖之DNA分子標誌，尋找與巨峰無子變異株的無子性狀連鎖之DNA分子標誌，未來可開發為世界第一個巨峰系四倍體葡萄無子性狀連鎖之DNA分子標誌，對四倍體無子葡萄之育種及相關之研究將有莫大之助益。 98 年度主要工作包括： 1. 巨峰葡萄無子化技術開發。 2. 無子葡萄品種及巨峰葡萄無子變異株之果粒催大。 3. 尋找與巨峰無子變異株無子化性狀連鎖之DNA分子標誌。 4. 培育三倍體無子葡萄新品種。另外，本計畫將利用環刻技術來改善國產巨峰葡萄之品質。目前巨峰葡萄果農所用之根砧種類對果實生產有顯著之影響，對果實著色亦有不同之效果。常見之 1202 根砧所產生之果實大，產量高，然成熟期在台灣之夏季高溫下果實著色極差。前期研究結果顯示環刻可以提昇一年二收巨峰葡萄夏果之著色與糖度。此效應在 1202 根砧上應更加顯著。如此將可利用 1202 砧生產果實大且著色良好之巨峰葡萄。以此簡單之技術克服葡萄著色不良，可大幅提高葡萄果實之商品價值及果農之收入。本計畫主要工作： 1. 分析巨峰葡萄目前主要之商業化砧穗組合之生長發育及果實品質。 2. 測試於著果期及轉色期環刻對於各不同砧穗組合之果實著色與品質之影響，探討環刻於我國溫暖之亞熱帶氣候及一年二收模式下之潛力， 3. 尋求在此一栽培體系下之最佳環刻時期及對環刻反應最佳之砧穗組合...|$|R
40|$|Some {{plant growth}} regulators, {{including}} ethephon, can stimulate abscission of mature grape berries. The stimulation of grape berry abscission reduces fruit detachment force (FDF) {{and promotes the}} development of a dry stem scar, both of which could facilitate the production of high quality stemless fresh-cut table grapes. The objective of this research was to determine how two potential abscission treatments, 1445 and 2890 mg/L ethephon, affected FDF, pre-harvest abscission, fruit quality, and ethephon residue of Thompson Seedless and Crimson <b>Seedless</b> <b>grapes.</b> Both ethephon treatments strongly induced abscission of Thompson Seedless berries causing > 90 % pre-harvest abscission. Lower ethephon rates, a shorter post-harvest interval, or berry retention systems such as nets, would be needed to prevent excessive pre-harvest losses. The treatments also slightly affected Thompson Seedless berry skin color, with treated fruit being darker, less uniform in color and with a more yellow hue than non-treated fruit. Ethephon residues on Thompson <b>Seedless</b> <b>grapes</b> treated with the lower concentration of ethephon were below legal limits at harvest. Ethephon treatments also promoted abscission of Crimson Seedless berries, but dropper-harvest abscission was much lower ( 49 %) in Crimson Seedless compared to Thompson Seedless. Treated fruit were slightly darker than non-treated fruit, but ethephon did not affect SSC, acidity, or firmness of Crimson Seedless, and ethephon residues were below legal limits...|$|R
