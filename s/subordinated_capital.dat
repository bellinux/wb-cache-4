40|$|We {{analyze the}} leading reform {{proposals}} {{to address the}} structural vulnerabilities of money market mutual funds (MMFs). We assume that the main goal of MMF reform is safeguarding financial stability. In light of this goal, reforms should reduce the ex ante incentives for MMFs to take excessive risk and increase the ex post resilience of MMFs to system-wide runs. Our analysis suggests that requiring MMFs to have <b>subordinated</b> <b>capital</b> buffers could generate significant financial stability benefits. <b>Subordinated</b> <b>capital</b> provides MMFs with loss absorption capacity, lowering {{the probability that a}} MMF suffers losses large enough to trigger a run, and reduces incentives to take excessive risks.

5|$|Robert Hartwell {{notes that}} in the Northern Song dynasty there were two types of elites who {{dominated}} the civil service: a founding elite and a professional elite. The founding elite consisted of the North China military governors of the 10th century, their associates, personal staffs, and bureaucrats who {{had served in the}} capitals of the administrations of the previous Five Dynasties. The professional bureaucracy consisted of elite families who had established residence in Kaifeng or <b>subordinate</b> <b>capitals,</b> claimed prestigious clan ancestry, had intermarried with other prominent families, had members in higher offices over generations, and periodically dominated Song government until the 12th century. The prominent families of this professional elite accounted for 18 of the 11th century chancellors, the highest official post. From 960 to 986, the founding military elite from Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hebei represented 46% of fiscal offices, people from districts in Songzhou—the military governorship of the founding emperor—represented 22% of fiscal offices, and those from Kaifeng and Luoyang filled 13% of fiscal posts. In the same period, the founding elite and professional elite filled over 90% of policy-making positions. However, after 983, when the south had been conquered and consolidated into the empire, a semi-hereditary professional elite gradually replaced the founding elite. After 1086 not a single family of the founding elite had a member in either policy-making or financial positions. Between 998 and 1085, the 35 most important families of the professional elite represented only 5% of the families that had members in policy-making offices, yet they disproportionately held 23% of these positions. By the late 11th century the professional elite began to break apart as a distinguishable status group aiming for civil service. They were replaced by a multitude of local gentry lineages who had their children pursue a slew of different professions other than official careers. Hartwell states that this shift of power {{was the result of the}} professional elite's lineage strategies being undermined by the rise of factional partisan politics in the latter half of the 11th century.|$|R

40|$|There {{is now a}} {{vigorous}} debate, {{in the era of}} labor’s decline, concerning the future of the American unions. Some have argued that revitalization requires the replacement of the so-called service model of unionism which focuses mainly on meeting the needs of existing members by an “organizing ” model that emphasizes expanding membership. This article argues that, even if organizing is important, the main problem is that unions have remained <b>subordinate</b> to <b>capital</b> and to the Democratic Party. Unions need to regain their independence, but the top leaders are probably not capable of reversing the transformation of members into clients. What is needed is an independent labor-oriented catalyst that raises the question of the democrati-zation of the labor movement, chiefly from the bottom. The crisis of the United States labor movement is an old story but it has entered a stage where predictions of its virtual disappearance as a significant economic force are now fairly common, even among some of organized labor’s top leaders. For the fifteen years after the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan, even as deindustrialization decimated most of the largest production unions and many smaller ones as well, and under the duress produced by Ronald Reagan’s bold firing of 11, 000 striking air traffic controllers, many unions gave bac...|$|R

Banks took actions to increase capital by slowing lending and raising profit margins, not fully passing through the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts.

50|$|Before the thesaphiban reforms, {{the country}} {{consisted}} of partially independent cities called mueang, some directly <b>subordinate</b> to the <b>capital,</b> some <b>subordinate</b> to larger mueang, or {{to one or}} more of the tributary kingdoms. Before the reforms, governors inherited their posts from their family lineage, and lived on taxes they collected in their area, a practice formally called tax farming.

The arrangement resulted in governors being appointed and paid by the central government, and mueang developed into provinces. An essential step in the ending of tax farming was the creation on 3 September 1885 of the Royal Survey Department. Though its first fruits were not obtained until 1901, the department's cadastral surveys, i.e., surveys of specific land parcels, made possible the defining of ownership for land registration and equitable taxation.

Our geographical focus is trained upon the emergence of the Global North Atlantic, that zone providing the strategic raw materials and food supplies indispensable to the consolidation of capitalism - timber, naval stores, metals, cereals, fish and whales. I argue for a broader geographical perspective on these movements, one capable of revealing the dialectical interplay of frontiers on all sides of the Atlantic. From its command posts in Amsterdam, Dutch capital deployed American silver in the creation of successive frontiers within Europe, transforming Scandinavian and Baltic regions. The frontier character of these transformations was decisive, premised on drawing readily exploitable supplies of land and labour power into the orbit of capital. We see in northern Europe precisely what we see in the Americas - a pattern of commodity-centred environmental transformation, and thence relative ecological exhaustion, from which the only escape was renewed global conquest and ever-wider cycles of combined and uneven development...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} large financial firms {{has led to}} consideration of alternative regulatory structures. This has intensified recently because of the worldwide turmoil in financial markets. One important consideration has been to increase reliance on market discipline [...] most notably, increased reliance on subordinated debt (sub-debt) in the bank capital structure to discipline banks' risk taking. This proposal, however, has been subject to criticism related {{to the quality of}} the signal generated in current sub-debt markets. We argue that previous studies evaluating the potential usefulness of sub-debt proposals have evaluated sub-debt spreads in a very different environment from that characterized by a fully implemented sub-debt program, where the market will become deeper, issuance will be more frequent, debt will be viewed as a more viable means to raise capital, bond dealers will be less reluctant to publicly disclose more details on debt transactions, and generally, the market will be more closely followed. As a test to see how the quality of the signal may change, we evaluate the risk-spread relationship [...] accounting for the enhanced liquidity and market transparency surrounding new debt issues. Our empirical results indicate a superior risk-spread relationship surrounding the period of new debt issuance due, we posit, to greater liquidity and transparency. Our results overall suggest that the degree of market discipline would be significantly enhanced by a mandatory sub-debt program, thus suggesting a potential role for sub-debt in the banking regulatory reform.
