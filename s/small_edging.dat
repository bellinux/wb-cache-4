40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the thermal stress intensity factor for <b>small</b> <b>edge</b> interfacial crack between bonded dissimilar plates subjected to uniform change of temperature by using the crack tip stress method. The stress intensity factor of edge interface crack is strongly controlled by the singular stress field at the interface edge of the bonded plates without the crack when the crack becomes extremely short. In this study, the <b>small</b> <b>edge</b> interface crack problem under thermal stress is solved by superposing the uniaxial tension problem with edge singularity and the uniform stress problem having the boundary condition of temperature change and uniaxial compression. The calculation shows that the stress intensity factors of the <b>small</b> <b>edge</b> interface crack under thermal stress can be evaluated from four factors related only to the Dundurs 2 ̆ 7 parameters α and β. In addition, the expression of the stress intensity factor for the <b>small</b> <b>edge</b> interface crack under the logarithmic edge singularity is presented when the material combination is α= 2 β...|$|R

50|$|Typically skip bins have a {{distinctive}} shape: the longitudinal cross-section of the skip bin {{is either a}} trapezoid or two stacked trapezoids. The lower trapezoid has the <b>smaller</b> <b>edge</b> {{at the bottom of}} the skip bin, and a longer edge at the top. Where there is an upper trapezoid, it has the <b>smaller</b> <b>edge</b> at the top. At either end of the skip bin there is a sloping floor or wall.

40|$|We discuss Lepp-centroid versus Lepp-midpoint {{algorithms}} for Delaunay quality triangulation. We present geometrical {{results that}} {{ensure that the}} centroid version produces triangulations with both average smallest angles greater than those obtained with the midpoint version and with bigger <b>smallest</b> <b>edges,</b> without suffering from a rare looping case associated to the midpoint method. Empirical study shows that the centroid method behaves significantly better than the midpoint version (and than the offcenter algorithm for angles bigger than 25), for geometries whose initial Delaunay triangulation have triangle <b>smallest</b> <b>edges</b> over the boundary.

500|$|In any graph, {{directed}} or undirected, {{there is}} a straightforward algorithm for finding a widest path once the weight of its minimum-weight edge is known: simply delete all <b>smaller</b> <b>edges</b> and search for any path among the remaining edges using breadth first search or depth first search. Based on this test, there also exists a linear time algorithm for finding a widest [...] path in an undirected graph, that does not use the maximum spanning tree. The main idea of the algorithm is to apply the linear-time path-finding algorithm to the median edge weight in the graph, and then either to delete all <b>smaller</b> <b>edges</b> or contract all larger edges according to whether a path does or does not exist, and recurse in the resulting smaller graph.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effect of {{adhesion}} layer and material combination on the stress intensity factor for <b>small</b> <b>edge</b> interface crack in butt joint plate under uniaxial tension. The stress intensity factors of the <b>small</b> <b>edge</b> interface crack are analyzed by the crack tip stress method with varying the crack length, adhesive thickness and material combination. The stress intensity factor of the edge interface crack {{is controlled by the}} singular stress field at the interface free edge in butt joint without the crack when the crack is very small. The calculation shows that the stress intensity factors K 1 and K 2 of the <b>small</b> <b>edge</b> interface crack are related to the intensity of singular stress field Kσ and the singularity index λ 12 at the interface edge without the crack. Then, it is found that the stress intensity factors can be expressed as K 1 ＋iK 2 = (F 1 ＋iF 2) Kσaλ 12 － 0. 5 √π(1 ＋ 2 iε) and the normalized stress intensity factors F 1 and F 2 are constant values when the crack length a/h< 10 - 2 irrespective of the adhesive thickness and length of butt joint plate. Therefore, it can be concluded that K 1 and Kσ are an equivalent parameter each other...|$|R
