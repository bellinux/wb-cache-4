The rivalry between the Company's two most senior {{servants}} in Bengal was aggravated by the intrigues of Company servants and interlopers keen to undermine Charnock's authority and resume their smuggling operations on the side. Charnock was further irritated by the fact that members of Hedges' staff from Hooghly were regularly sabotaging their colleagues' work in Cossimbazar by poaching the local commodities. In 1684 the exasperated directors restored <b>supervisory</b> <b>control</b> over Bengal to the new president at Madras, William Gyfford, and replaced Hedges in Bengal with John Beard, the elder.|$|E
25|$|Stuxnet {{specifically}} targets {{programmable logic}} controllers (PLCs), which allow the automation of electromechanical processes such as those used to control machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or centrifuges for separating nuclear material. Exploiting four zero-day flaws, Stuxnet functions by targeting machines using the Microsoft Windows operating system and networks, then seeking out Siemens Step7 software. Stuxnet reportedly compromised Iranian PLCs, collecting information on industrial systems and causing the fast-spinning centrifuges to tear themselves apart. Stuxnet’s design and architecture are not domain-specific {{and it could be}} tailored as a platform for attacking modern <b>supervisory</b> <b>control</b> and data acquisition (SCADA) and PLC systems (e.g., in factory assembly lines or power plants), the majority of which reside in Europe, Japan and the US. Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost one fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges. Targeting industrial control systems, the worm infected over 200,000 computers and caused 1,000 machines to physically degrade.|$|E
25|$|A {{microprocessor-based}} digital {{protection relay}} can replace {{the functions of}} many discrete electromechanical instruments. These relays convert voltage and currents to digital form and process the resulting measurements using a microprocessor. The digital relay can emulate functions of many discrete electromechanical relays in one device, simplifying protection design and maintenance. Each digital relay can run self-test routines to confirm its readiness and alarm if a fault is detected. Digital relays can also provide functions such as communications (SCADA) interface, monitoring of contact inputs, metering, waveform analysis, and other useful features. Digital relays can, for example, store multiple sets of protection parameters, which allows {{the behavior of the}} relay to be changed during maintenance of attached equipment. Digital relays also can provide protection strategies impossible to implement with electromechanical relays. This is particularly so in long distance high voltage or multi-terminal circuits or in lines that are series or shunt compensated They also offer benefits in self-testing and communication to <b>supervisory</b> <b>control</b> systems.|$|E

40|$|The Ocean Engineering Division at the Naval Command Control and Ocean Surveillance Center RDT&E Division (NRaD) has {{developed}} and fielded two successive untethered, <b>supervisory</b> <b>controlled</b> UUV systems: a prototype, and an improved model. These robotic vehicle systems {{were part of}} the Advanced Unmanned Search System (AUSS) program which had its genesis in the early 1970 s. At that time the idea of performing useful work with untethered robots in the deep ocean was met with some skepticism. Because of this program and the verity of these two vehicles, especially the improved one, we now know that <b>supervisory</b> <b>controlled</b> systems can be employed effectively. A systems engineering approach was applied to the design and construction of the prototype.

25|$|The 1894 Unorganized Territories Game Preservation Act {{introduced}} {{regulations that}} severely limited {{the ability of}} the Cree, Dene, and Inuit peoples to access wildlife on their traditional territories. By the 1920s, Aboriginals were excluded from hunting and trapping grounds contained in Wood Buffalo National Park. The establishment of a game warden service in the park allowed for direct surveillance and <b>supervisory</b> <b>control</b> over Aboriginal hunters. As a result, the most basic elements of the Aboriginal subsistence cycle, including seasonal movements, fur trapping, and the gathering of food, were redefined as criminal activities through federal game regulations. According to historian John Sandlos, attitudes towards Cree, Dene, and Inuit hunters were socially constructed and flawed due to observer bias, racial stereotyping, and inaccurate reporting by park officials. Furthermore, Sandlos emphasizes that incidents of wildlife overkill does not undermine the right or ability of Aboriginal hunters to manage local bison populations in partnership with government experts.|$|E

Traditionally, the design of such control systems is based on finite state machines. An alternative, more flexible approach is based on task-resource models.

We propose a generic migration approach based on model transformations that includes normalisation of legacy architectures before their actual transformation.

As such, our migration approach constitutes a series of model transformations, for which we define transformation rules. We illustrate the applicability of this model-drive...|$|R
