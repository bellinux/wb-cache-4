On Halloween her father, to amuse her, picks a pumpkin that she selects, and fashions a jack-o-lantern out of it. Her new toy pleases the child immensely, and at once takes a place in her affections equal to that held by her dollie. So it is natural {{that she should be}} thinking about the two of them when she is tucked into bed and falls asleep. Perhaps that was why the queen of the fairies came to her and invited her to a Halloween party that her loyal subjects were giving in their woodland retreat. And so that Marie would be perfectly happy, not feel embarrassed among strangers, the queen asked Dollie and Pumpkin to be her guests also. And, as a further mark of favor, <b>she</b> <b>waved</b> <b>her</b> hand, and Dollie and Pumpkin could run around and talk as well as Marie could. It certainly made it more enjoyable for the little girl. A fairy Halloween party is one of the finest things going in the amusement line, and only very nice and very good little girls are invited to them. As Marie filled these requirements, she had a perfectly glorious time, but was inclined to weep when she woke up later in her own little bed, and found that her toys had lost their miraculous gift of life. But it consoled her somewhat to have them, for they served as reminders of her wonderful evening. And perhaps the fairies will ask her to attend another party later. If they do, she has decided that Pumpkin and Dollie must have their shares of the good times as before." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, while {{promoting}} her eighth studio album Damita Jo, Jackson made surprise {{performances of}} [...] "Together Again" [...] and [...] "All Nite (Don't Stop)" [...] at New York's Gay Pride March. [...] "Together Again" [...] {{was one of}} her older songs on the 2008 Rock Witchu Tour, her first tour in seven years. It was at the middle of the setlist. She was dressed in a gold and black glam hip hop-inspired track suit, and one gold glove. Variety magazine's Phil Gallo likened her vocals in the song to that of Diana Ross's. Rap-Up noted the audience [...] "went wild" [...] during the song. While reviewing the Vancouver concert, Marsha Lederman of Globe and Mail noted that the most memorable moment of the show was when Jackson [...] "stopped on the catwalk after her hit Together Again, listened to the crowd roar its approval, and became emotional – really emotional. We're talking tears. 'Thank you,' she said – seeming to really mean it, as <b>she</b> <b>waved</b> <b>her</b> hands, begging the audience to stop", she completed. While promoting her second greatest hits album Number Ones, the singer performed an eight-minute medley of six hits during the American Music Awards of 2009. It included [...] "Control", [...] "Miss You Much", [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", [...] "If", [...] "Make Me", and finished with [...] "Together Again". For the latter's performance, Jackson stood alone at center stage, smiling, as the received applauses and standing ovation from the audience. It also was the closing song of her concert at Essence Music Festival in New Orleans, in July 2010, which she headlined. [...] "Together Again" [...] was again performed as a closing number on her [...] 2011 tour as a dedication to her late brother, Michael Jackson, wearing a tight white one-piece disco suit. MTV News' writer Vaughn Schoonmaker noted that the song appeared to be the biggest hit of the show. Jackson also included the song on her 2015-16 Unbreakable World Tour. Writing for the Hartford Courant, Thomas Kintner pointed out that [...] "A finale of 'Together Again', offered as a simple tribute that recalled her brother again, proved the evening's highlight, a relaxed trip through the sort of juicy pop Jackson has stockpiled throughout her career, and which still charms when she lets it run". The song is also included on the 2017 State of the World Tour.|$|E

5000|$|CBC's TV {{news anchor}} Peter Mansbridge {{went to an}} airport {{security}} headquarters office in Ottawa with Guergis to view the tapes of the alleged incident.

500|$|The Emancipation of Mimi spawns {{yet another}} career-redefining {{hit in the}} sweet, soulful [...] "Fly Like a Bird", an honest-to-God {{religious}} mantra about redemption. Set against a low-key, organ-spiced groove that recalls mid-'70s R, Carey opens with a pretty, wispy vocal and buoyant harmonies throughout the first chorus before <b>she</b> <b>waves</b> <b>her</b> arms, parts the clouds and wails to the heavens as a mile-high wall of gospel background vocals joins in for the crescendo. The flight of 'Bird' from humble call for deliverance into a frenzied ecclesiastic hymn is utterly spine-tingling. A joyful noise.|$|R
60|$|Yet I was {{so certain}} that the {{prospect}} of such a sacrifice afar off, must destroy the happiness of Agnes; and I was so sure, from her manner, of its being unseen by her then, and having cast no shadow on her yet; that I could as soon have injured her, as given her any warning of what impended. Thus it was that we parted without explanation: <b>she</b> <b>waving</b> <b>her</b> hand and smiling farewell from the coach window; her evil genius writhing on the roof, {{as if he had}} her in his clutches and triumphed.|$|R
