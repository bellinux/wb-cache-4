These seed stocks were heterozygous for recessive genetic markers, and/or heterozygous for a chromosome translocation. Spikes from heterozygous M 1 plants were harvested and <b>seeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk.</b> Spikes from heterozygous M 2 plants were harvested and planted in M 3 rows. The M 3 rows were observed {{for the absence of}} segregating progeny and/or were observed cytologically for the presence of a heterozygous translocation. M 3 rows not segregating for the genetic markers were crossed onto plants homozygous for the genetic markers. The F 1 progenies were observed for an expected ratio of 1 normal: 1 recessive plant. All nonsegregating lines were found to be non-heterozygous. These lines most likely occurred due to seed and pollen contamination or were the result of crossing over between genetic markers. Fertile M 2 plants were harvested from the treated heterozygous translocation seed stock. Normally, barley plants heterozygous for a translocation will produce semisterile spikes. Plants that would normally be semisterile but are fertile could be carrying a mutation conditioning apomixis. Progeny of the fertile M 2 plants were examined cytologically for the presence of the heterozygous translocation. All selected lines contained the normal seven pairs of chromosomes and were the result of seed or pollen contamination. Seed stocks which could eliminate the problem of contamination in future experiments were developed and discussed. Haploviable mutants closely linked with the male sterile locus, msg 2, were isolated <b>in</b> these <b>seed</b> stocks. Haploviable mutants are recognized by upset genetic ratios of alleles linked with the mutant. Selfed progenies of plants carrying a haploviable mutation contained fertile and male sterile plants in about a 1 : 1 ratio.

50|$|Bonanza farming was {{dependent}} {{on the use of}} seasonal migrant labor. At planting and harvesting times foremen often supervised some 500 to 1000 extra workers on a bonanza farm. When weather and market conditions were good, bonanza farms made large profits; because the managers could buy <b>seeds</b> and equipment <b>in</b> <b>bulk,</b> they had lower production costs. But in times of drought or low wheat prices, their profits fell. As the Red River Valley was developed for agriculture, the Bonanza farms were distinguished by their widespread use of migrant labor, some of whom were Mexican immigrants or migrants, known as braceros. European Americans also worked as migrant laborers. Family farmers, with fewer workers to pay and less money invested in equipment, could better handle boom-and-bust cycles. By the 1890s, most bonanza farms had broken up into smaller farms.|$|R
40|$|Open Access JournalCassava brown streak disease (CBSD) {{has been}} a problem in the East African coastal cassava growing areas for more than 70 years. The disease is caused by {{successful}} infection with Cassava Brown Streak Virus (CBSV) (Family, Potyviridae: Genus, Ipomovirus). Diagnosis of CBSD has for long been primarily leaf symptoms-based. This is unreliable due to the irregular pattern and variability of the disease phenotype in roots and leaves. The suitable method to undertake reliable field diagnostic survey and derive acceptable analysis of the disease situation has never been standardized. Zigzag and diagonal approaches for disease assessment have been used successfully on other diseases infecting cassava such as Cassava mosaic disease but neither of them has ever been tested and proven suitable for CBSD assessment. In addition, the suitable sample for successful molecular detection of the causal virus has never been optimised. The number of samples to be collected from large plant stands which would be a true representation of the population has never been determined. The effect of sample bulking on possible detection or non detection of infection particularly when un-infected samples are combined with infected ones is not known. In this study, the comparative efficiencies of diagonal and zigzag approaches to CBSD field diagnosis were tested through surveys conducted in 20 randomly selected farmers’ fields in major cassava growing areas of the Coastal and Lake Zones in Tanzania. Using molecular diagnostic techniques, the plant parts which are suitable for Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) detection were determined. Sample bulking was tested for rationalized laboratory detection of CBSV over large cassava stands. The study revealed that CBSD incidences and severities obtained using either diagonal or zigzag approach did not differ significantly. Suitable parts for CBSV detection were identified to be flowers, fruits, apical buds, young tender leaves, newly-opened leaves, youngest symptomatic leaves, the tender top-green portion of the stem and non-necrotic storage root tissues. CBSV was not detected <b>in</b> <b>seeds.</b> <b>In</b> <b>bulked</b> leaf samples, CBSV was detected from ratios of 1 : 1 up to 1 : 19 of CBSVinfected to CBSV-free tissues in cultivar Albert. It was concluded that either zigzag or diagonal can be used for CBSD field diagnosis. A choice of the suitable sample is of absolute necessity, and bulking of many samples for collective CBSV detection over a large crop stand is effective.

A total of 100 food samples were collected randomly from markets in Oman. Out of 59 samples, 8   (13. 5 %) were successfully amplified with the maize plant specific PCR. GM screening showed negative for all samples, which indicated low or no GM maize in the samples tested. Out of 57 soy containing samples, 40 (70 %) were successfully amplified by the soybean plant specific PCR. Six samples out of the 40 (15 %) were found positive for GM using P 35 S-cf 3 /P 35 S-cr 4 and HA-nos 118 -f/HA-nos 118 -r, primer pairs and using GMO 5 /GMO 9 and GMO 7 /GMO 8 primer pairs for specific detection of Roundup Ready Soybean.

40|$|AbstractUsing the {{peptide hormone}} {{glucagon}} and Aβ(1 – 40) as model systems, we {{have sought to}} elucidate the mechanisms by which fibrils grow and multiply. We here present real-time observations of growing fibrils at a single-fibril level. Growing from preformed seeds, glucagon fibrils were able to generate new fibril ends by continuously branching into new fibrils. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} time amyloid fibril branching has been observed in real-time. Glucagon fibrils formed by branching always grew in the forward direction of the parent fibril with a preferred angle of 35 – 40 °. Furthermore, branching never occurred at the tip of the parent fibril. In contrast, in a previous study by some of us, Aβ(1 – 40) fibrils grew exclusively by elongation of preformed <b>seeds.</b> Fibrillation kinetics <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> solution were characterized by light scattering. A growth process with branching, or other processes that generate new ends from existing fibrils, should theoretically give rise to different fibrillation kinetics than growth without such a process. We show that the effect of adding seeds should be particularly different in the two cases. Our light-scattering data on glucagon and Aβ(1 – 40) confirm this theoretical prediction, demonstrating the central role of fibril-dependent nucleation in amyloid fibril growt...|$|R

40|$|TILLING (for Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) is a {{well-established}} method for identifying plants carrying point mutations in genes of interest. A traditional TILLING project requires a significant {{investment of time}} and resources to establish the mutant population and screening infrastructure. Here, we describe a modified TILLING procedure that substantially reduces the investment needed to perform mutation screening. Our motivation for developing iTILLING was to make it practical for individual laboratories to rapidly perform mutation screens using specialized genetic backgrounds. With iTILLING, M 2 <b>seeds</b> are collected <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> from the mutagenized population of plants, greatly reducing the labor needed to manage the mutant lines. Growth of the M 2 seedlings for mutation screening, tissue collection, and DNA extraction are all performed in 96 -well format. Mutations are then identified using high-resolution melt-curve analysis of gene-specific polymerase chain reaction products. Individual plants carrying mutations of interest are transferred from the 96 -well growth plates to soil. One scientist can complete an iTILLING screen in less than 4 months. As a proof-of-principle test, we applied iTILLING to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants that were homozygous for the mekk 1 - 1 (for MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 1) mutation and also carried a MEKK 1 rescue construct. The goal of our screen was to identify mutations in the closely linked MEKK 2 and MEKK 3 loci. We obtained five mutations in MEKK 2 and seven mutations in MEKK 3, all located within 20 kb of the mekk 1 - 1 T-DNA insertion. Using repeated iterations of the iTILLING process, mutations in three or more tandemly duplicated genes could be generated...|$|R
