40|$|In recent years, Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (UAV) {{research}} and development at Bandung Institute of Technology in Indonesia has achieved the testing stage in the field. This testing was still being classified as the early testing, since some of the preliminary tests were {{carried out in the}} scale of the laboratory. The paper would discuss the laboratory test and several tests that were done in the field. Discussions were stressed in the procedure and the aim that will be achieved, along with several early results. The testing was carried out in the lake with the area around 8300 Ha and the maximum depth of 50 meters. The location of the testing was chosen with consideration of minimizing the effect of the current and the wave, as well as the location that was not too far from the Laboratory. The type of testing that will be discussed in paper was Heading Lock Maneuver Testing. The vehicle was tested to move with a certain cruising speed, afterwards it was commanded by an arbitrarily <b>selected</b> <b>heading</b> direction. The response and the behavior of the vehicle were recorded as the data produced by the testing.

40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that, in {{addition}} to non-agreeing passives, Finnish has even an agreeing passive. The agreeing passive shows similar behaviour to non-canonical passives in other languages, such as get-passives in English. The agreeing passive differs from ordinary copular constructions in various ways, most importantly in the availability of an event-interpretation. Agreeing and non-agreeing passives have similar structure in the tense and vP domains; the differences between them {{can be attributed to}} differences in the <b>selecting</b> <b>heads.</b> Agreeing passives differ from copular constructions in that the latter lack a vP. The <b>selecting</b> <b>heads</b> are, however, the same in the two constructions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{suffers from}} the hot spot problem where the sensor nodes closest to the base station are need to relay more packet than the nodes {{farther away from the}} base station. Thus, lifetime of sensory network depends on these closest nodes. Clustering methods are used to extend the lifetime of a wireless sensor network. However, current clustering algorithms usually utilize two techniques; <b>selecting</b> cluster <b>heads</b> with more residual energy, and rotating cluster heads periodically to distribute the energy consumption among nodes in each cluster and lengthen the network lifetime. Most of the algorithms use random selection for <b>selecting</b> the cluster <b>heads.</b> Here, we propose a novel trajectory clustering technique for <b>selecting</b> the cluster <b>heads</b> in WSNs. Our algorithm <b>selects</b> the cluster <b>heads</b> based on traffic and rotates periodically. It provides the first trajectory based clustering technique for <b>selecting</b> the cluster <b>heads</b> and to extenuate the hot spot problem by prolonging the network lifetime.
