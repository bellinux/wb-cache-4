500|$|In the 2013 {{video game}} , a prequel to the Arkham series, {{there are several}} {{references}} to The Killing Joke. When Batman enters a carnival-esque room, Joker tells him he got {{a great deal on}} an out-of-service amusement park, [...] "You <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> look on the real estate agent's face when we shook hands on the deal!", alluding to Joker's conning a theme park entrepreneur into granting him the rights of a run-down amusement park early in the graphic novel and then proceeding to murder him via Joker toxin. In a level featuring a psychiatric interview with Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Joker is playable as the Red Hood, walking through the chemical plant that will end with him becoming the Joker, as well as earlier beating up several patrons at a Comedy Club due to very poor reception towards a joke he made. The name of the achievement for defeating the Joker in the ending of the game [...] "Perhaps sooner, perhaps later" [...] was a reference to Batman's talk with [...] "Joker" [...] {{in the beginning of the}} graphic novel. While promoting the game, Troy Baker, who voices the Joker in the game, recites a monologue from the graphic novel.|$|E

After abstaining {{for a couple of}} days, it was really very refreshing." [...] Only months earlier, the consumption of beer would have been illegal. [...] An amendment to the Volstead Act allowing the sale of beer went into effect in April 1933. [...] The availability of beer had a noticeable impact in Ann Arbor on football Saturdays. [...] On October 8, 1933, the day after the Michigan-Michigan State football game, Ford noted that his fraternity was planning a big party with a barrel of beer. [...] He added, [...] "You <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> campus this week-end, more drunks than ever and they all claim that the year is just beginning. I'm afraid to imagine what it will be by the Ohio State game." [...] Ford's concern proved prescient. [...] After the Ohio State game, the university attracted unwanted national publicity when its board in control of athletics mailed notices to ticket holders warning that they would be ejected if complaints were received about their drinking. [...] The notices stated that the board was not concerned with [...] "the personal habits and tastes" [...] of ticket-holders, but felt a deep concern [...] "when indulgence in such habits and tastes results in conduct disgusting or offensive to other patrons." ...|$|E
