The two who most influence—and, <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> cause the most trouble for—Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are their sorcerous advisers, Ningauble of the Seven Eyes and Sheelba of the Eyeless Face. These two lead the two heroes {{into some of}} their most interesting and dangerous adventures.|$|E
25|$|In a work by Lê Quý Đôn called Phủ biên tạp lục (1776), many Nha Trang-related {{names were}} mentioned, such as đầm Nha Trang, dinh Nha Trang, nguồn Nha Trang, and đèo Nha Trang. <b>Some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that the Nha Trang is {{actually}} {{a part of the}} Dead Sea in the early 1700s but the idea was then removed in 1738.|$|E
25|$|Schwarzenegger's {{breakthrough}} {{film was}} the sword-and-sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian in 1982, {{which was a}} box-office hit. This {{was followed by a}} sequel, Conan the Destroyer, in 1984, although it was not as successful as its predecessor. In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video, Carnival in Rio. In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character, and what <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> was his acting career's signature role, in James Cameron's science fiction thriller film The Terminator. Following this, Schwarzenegger made Red Sonja in 1985.|$|E

25|$|The {{classification}} of text {{as belonging to}} the triple tradition (or for that matter, double tradition) is not always definitive, depending rather {{on the degree of}} similarity demanded. For example, Matthew and Mark report the cursing of the fig tree, clearly a single incident, despite some substantial differences of wording and content. Searching Luke, however, we find only the parable of the barren fig tree, in a different point of the narrative. <b>Some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that Luke has extensively adapted an element of the triple tradition, while others would regard it as a distinct pericope.|$|E
25|$|However, {{concerning}} the legend that cats could speak, {{it has been}} pointed out {{that it may have}} arisen because humans would misinterpret the cat's meowing as human language, and for this reason <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that the cat is not a type of yōkai. In 1992 (Heisei 4), in the Yomiuri newspaper, there was an article that argued that when people thought they had heard a cat speak, upon listening a second time, they realized that it was simply the cat's meowing and that it was only coincidence that it resembled a word in human language.|$|E
25|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{throughout history}} had, arguably, {{been tempted to}} reduce two {{of these kinds of}} belief and knowledge to the other one: René Descartes and David Hume thought that the only knowledge that people start with is self-knowledge. Some logical positivists (and <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> Wittgenstein, or Wilfrid Sellars) held that people start with beliefs only about the external world. (Arguably, Friedrich Schelling and Emmanuel Levinas held that people start with beliefs only about other people.) It is not possible, on Davidson's view, for a person to have only one of the three kinds of mental content; anyone who has beliefs of one of the kinds must have beliefs of the other two kinds.|$|E

25|$|The Yang {{family first}} became {{involved}} in the study of t'ai chi ch'uan (taijiquan) in the early 19th century. The founder of the Yang-style was Yang Luchan (楊露禪), aka Yang Fu-k'ui (楊福魁, 1799–1872), who studied under Ch'en Chang-hsing starting in 1820. Yang became a teacher in his own right, and his subsequent expression of t'ai chi ch'uan became known as the Yang-style, and directly {{led to the development of}} other three major styles of t'ai chi ch'uan (see below). Yang Luchan (and <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> the art of t'ai chi ch'uan, in general) came to prominence as a result of his being hired by the Chinese Imperial family to teach t'ai chi ch'uan to the elite Palace Battalion of the Imperial Guards in 1850, a position he held until his death.|$|E
500|$|In January 1977, {{four years}} prior to {{becoming}} president, Ronald Reagan bluntly stated, {{in a conversation with}} Richard V. Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. [...] "My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> simplistic," [...] he said. [...] "It is this: We win and they lose. What do you think of that?" [...] In 1980, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere. Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Soviet Union and its ideology. Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an [...] "evil empire" [...] and predicted that Communism would be left on the [...] "ash heap of history," [...] while Thatcher inculpated the Soviets as [...] "bent on world dominance." ...|$|E
500|$|GameSpot's Greg Kasavin, who {{reviewed}} both versions, {{praised the}} game's ambition and {{the elements that}} worked, but said that people would focus on the faults with its narrative delivery and gameplay structure; he summed up the game as a [...] "great and original experience that's well worthwhile". Steve Butts of IGN said that, while <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> the gameplay made too many concessions towards casual players, {{it was still a}} well-built and enjoyable video game, praising most of the alterations made by the developers. Ryan McCaffrey of Official Xbox Magazine called the game a [...] "brilliant RPG" [...] despite noting its short length, praising its narrative, gameplay freedom, and in-game physics. Kieron Gillen, reviewing the game for PC Gamer, praised the game's wide variety of choice despite some elements such as the biomod upgrade system not evolving. He noted that the elements that had not been directly carried over from Deus Ex would taint people's perception of the game.|$|E

The function of figures like the bottom left was best described by Leon Battista Alberti almost a century earlier in 1435. [...] I like there to be someone in the 'historia', who tells the spectators what is going on, and either beckons them with his hand to look, or with ferocious expression and forbidding glance challenges them not to come near, as if he wished their business to be secret, or points to some danger or remarkable thing in the picture, or by his gestures invites you to laugh or weep with them.

5000|$|Following the tour, Springsteen {{moved back}} to New Jersey with his family. In 1998, he {{released}} the sprawling, four-disc box set of outtakes, Tracks. Later, he would acknowledge that the 1990s were a [...] "lost period" [...] for him: [...] "I didn't {{do a lot of}} work. <b>Some</b> people <b>would</b> <b>say</b> I didn't do my best work." ...|$|R
500|$|He {{was often}} in {{conflict}} with his brothers regarding internal matters, with Nhu, Diệm's most influential adviser, controlling {{the southern part of}} the country. The brothers often competed with each other for U.S. aid contracts and the rice trade, but did not interfere with matters in one another's territorial zone. Cẩn had once tried to set up an office for his secret police in Saigon (which was in Nhu's southern region) by showing Diệm his long list of detained political opponents, but insisted that he not have to report to Nhu. He brutally suppressed dissent by using torture and re-education camps to achieve his aims. Comparing Cẩn to his brothers, Scigliano said that he was [...] "also considered the most severe, <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> primitive, member of the family and he rules his domain with a strict and sometimes brutal hand". Referring to his autocratic style, a Vietnamese critic said that unlike Diệm, Cẩn was consistent and left his followers in no doubt as to what he wanted: [...] "They are not confused by double talk about democratic ideals and institutions". His creation of a well-defined system of incentives and deterrence has been cited as one reason for his success.|$|E
500|$|Shakira was {{mindful of}} the many critics who would judge her second album, because of the [...] "phenomenon" [...] label applied to her. She knew that <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that [...] "she had changed too much" [...] and others would reproach her if she {{remained}} the same. [...] "All I could do was to be myself. I understood that all I {{had to do was}} write the music I knew how to write and to write from the heart when I was compelled to. In that way, everything developed naturally, more so than I could have imagined", she said. In addition, Shakira insisted on perfection, working on the material to the point of exhaustion. [...] "I made two or three demos of each song. I became a human being so demanding of myself that until the song made my hair stand on end, I wouldn't stop". For the recording of Dónde Están los Ladrones? they were used old amplifiers to achieve a better sound, a German microphone with more than 40 years of existence and made several innovations in the instrumental mixes. Dónde Están los Ladrones? took nine months to produce in total, since more people worked on the album compared with her previous record. Shakira commented, [...] "To me it's a normal time, the gestation period for a baby. But many people wag their finger and tell me that the next one cannot take so long..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bull {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous composers of {{keyboard}} music of the early 17th century, exceeded only by Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck in the Netherlands, Girolamo Frescobaldi in Italy, and, <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> by his countryman and elder, the celebrated William Byrd. [...] He left many compositions for keyboard, some of which were collected in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book.|$|E
2500|$|The {{last quarter}} sales for AMC ended September 30th, 1966 (AMC {{was not on}} a {{calendar}} fiscal year) [...] were disappointing. AMC recorded a balance sheet loss of $12,648,000 for the year before Tax Credits and deferred Tax Assets. The 1965 and 1966 Ambassadors represented a crossroad in AMC's history, one at which <b>some</b> historians <b>would</b> <b>say</b> it took the wrong turn.|$|R
50|$|According to most authors {{organizational}} {{architecture is}} a metaphor, like traditional architecture it shapes the organizational (<b>some</b> authors <b>would</b> <b>say</b> the informational) space where life will take place. It also represents a concept which implies {{a connection between}} the organizational structure with other systems inside the organization {{in order to create a}} unique synergistic system which will be more than just the sum of its parts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Some</b> critics <b>would</b> <b>say</b> {{it is hard}} {{to ensure}} that {{briefing}} materials provided to participants are balanced and accurate. It is suggested that an advisory committee {{with a wide range of}} people are to be constituted; however, it can be challenging to obtain a balanced advisory committee at the first place. In this sense, it gives room for a biased and/or incomplete presentation of information.|$|R
2500|$|In 1999, roughly 14% of {{complaints}} to the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights (OCR) involved sex discrimination. [...] "Sexual harassment is as serious (and <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> more serious) {{a problem as}} it is in the workplace....(it) is not a new phenomena. [...] But it is only recently that the Supreme Court has said that schools can be held liable for money damages for sexual harassment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like {{any other}} {{extension}} of man, typography had psychic and social consequences that suddenly shifted previous boundaries {{and patterns of}} culture. In bringing the ancient and medieval worlds into fusion—or, as <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> confusion—the printed book created a third world, the modern world, which now encounters a new electric technology, or a new extension of man. Electric means of moving information are altering our typographic culture as sharply as print modified medieval manuscript and scholastic culture. (p. 171) ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{issue is}} that of free will, {{the degree to which}} people are {{responsible}} for their own choices. Free will relates to determinism, if everything is strictly determined by prior state, then <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that no one can have free will. Kurzweil holds a pragmatic belief in free will because he feels society needs it to function. He also suggests that quantum mechanics may provide [...] "a continual source of uncertainty at the most basic level of reality" [...] such that determinism does not exist.|$|E
6000|$|With what income Miss Dawkins {{was blessed}} {{no one seemed}} to know. She lived like a gentlewoman, as far as outward {{appearance}} went, and never seemed to be in want; but <b>some</b> people <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that she knew very well how many sides there were to a shilling, and some enemy had once declared that she was an [...] "old soldier." [...] Such was Miss Dawkins.|$|R
5000|$|Traditional (Burkean) conservatives {{tend to be}} anti-ideological, and <b>some</b> <b>would</b> even <b>say</b> anti-philosophical, {{promoting}} rather, as Russell Kirk explains, {{a steady}} flow of [...] "prescription and prejudice". Kirk's use of the word [...] "prejudice" [...] here is not intended to carry its contemporary pejorative connotation: a conservative himself, he believes that the inherited wisdom of the ages may be a better guide than apparently rational individual judgment.|$|R

2500|$|Carpenter {{had hoped}} to make a Howard Hawks style western like El Dorado or Rio Lobo, but when the $100,000 budget {{prohibited}} it, Carpenter refashioned the basic scenario of Rio Bravo into a modern setting. Carpenter employed the John T. Chance pseudonym for his original version of script, entitled The Anderson Alamo, but he used his own name for the writing credit on the completed film. The script was written in eight days. Carpenter joked, [...] "The script came together fast, <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> too fast." ...|$|E
2500|$|Egotism {{is closely}} related to an egocentric love for one's {{imagined}} self or narcissism – indeed <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> [...] "by egotism we may envisage a kind of socialized narcissism". Egotists have a strong tendency to talk about themselves [...] in a self-promoting fashion, and they may well be arrogant and boastful with a grandiose sense of their own importance. Their inability to recognise the accomplishments of others leaves them profoundly self-promoting; while sensitivity to criticism may lead on the egotist's part to narcissistic rage at a sense of insult.|$|E
2500|$|The last Sistine castrato {{to survive}} was Alessandro Moreschi, the only castrato {{to have made}} solo recordings. While an {{interesting}} historical record, these discs of his give us only {{a glimpse of the}} castrato voice – although he had been renowned as [...] "The Angel of Rome" [...] {{at the beginning of his}} career, <b>some</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> he was past his prime when the recordings were made in 1902 and 1904 and he never attempted to sing opera. He retired officially in March 1913, and died in 1922.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{complained of}} the banishment, and the climate, and {{everything}} that people complain of who are determined to be dissatisfied,--though, poor fellow, there is some ground for his complaints. Perhaps <b>some</b> people <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that he is idle. But he is scarcely that; he is rather restless than idle, so that he never persists in anything. Yet if a subject takes his fancy he will follow it up with exemplary patience till something diverts him.' ...|$|R
50|$|Suffragists used {{plays to}} create changes in social attitudes. Attending a play {{was a social}} and {{community}} event, therefore their message reached a large audience {{in a short period}} of time. <b>Some</b> suffragists <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> “a change in legislation was attributed to the production of one play.” Suffrage plays were a source of optimism for the female suffrage movement. Suffrage theatre gave prominence to women’s roles and issues for the first time and greatly influenced the women’s suffrage movement.|$|R
5000|$|Phil Labonte stated {{about the}} song: [...] "Tru-Kvlt-Metal" [...] is really sarcastic. It's really {{directed}} towards {{the people that}} we've heard year after year, record after record, saying, 'Oh, put out another record like The Fall Of Ideals. We've done that, {{and even if we}} did it, <b>some</b> purist <b>would</b> <b>say</b> it's tarnished anyway because we've already done it.
