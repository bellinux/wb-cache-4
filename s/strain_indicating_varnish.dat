40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{mechanical}} properties and phonon dispersions of fully hydrogenated borophene (borophane) under strains by first principles calculations. Uniaxial tensile strains along the a- and b-direction, respectively, and biaxial tensile strain have been considered. Our {{results show that the}} mechanical properties and phonon stability of borophane are both highly anisotropic. The ultimate tensile strain along the a-direction is only 0. 12, but it can be as large as 0. 30 along the b-direction. Compared to borophene and other 2 D materials (graphene, graphane, silicene, silicane, h-BN, phosphorene and MoS 2), borophane presents the most remarkable anisotropy in in-plane ultimate strain, which is very important for strain engineering. Furthermore, the phonon dispersions under the three applied <b>strains</b> <b>indicate</b> that borophane can withstand up to 5 % and 15 % uniaxial tensile strain along the a- and b-direction, respectively, and 9 % biaxial tensile <b>strain,</b> <b>indicating</b> that mechanical failure in borophane is likely to originate from phonon instability.

It {{is based on}} the inoculation of one organism, obtained by serial dilutions of cultured epimastigotes or isolated blood stream trypomastigotes, into enriched NNN medium (NNN-F: 93).
