500|$|In a 1995 interview, he {{said that}} {{after five years of}} touring with Yanni and working on his own debut album, he needed a break. [...] Yanni was still {{building}} his career and maintained a hectic concert schedule. [...] Working with Easton, on the other hand, was [...] "the best of both worlds". [...] "She just adopted a baby and is pretty settled in", <b>said</b> <b>Joseph.</b> Tour venues with her included Japan, Indonesia, Puerto Rico, and the United States, as well as routine appearances in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. In March 1995, he appeared with her on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno when she performed her new single at the time, [...] "My Cherie".|$|E
500|$|After {{moving to}} Los Angeles at age 23, he composed, arranged, and {{performed}} alongside Yanni {{for more than}} six years, performing in-concert with a number of notable symphony orchestras, touring throughout the U.S. and abroad as Yanni gained worldwide fame. [...] His first show was at the Starplex in Dallas with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra filming a video project. [...] "It was a real trial by fire for me", <b>said</b> <b>Joseph.</b> [...] "First show + 10,000 people + TV cameras equals NERVOUS." [...] He told Jane Fredericksen of the St. Croix Valley Press that [...] "It was a big jump, you don't really realize it at the time, but there's no in-between — going from playing nightclubs to arenas." [...] Some of these early tours included the Reflections of Passion, Revolution in Sound, Dare to Dream, Yanni Live, The Symphony Concerts 1993 and 1994 concert tours, as well as a performance in Germany that was broadcast throughout Europe and seen by 30 to 40 million viewers. [...] Joseph appears on the 1994 multi-platinum album and video, Live at the Acropolis. [...] He recounts, [...] "When I reflect back over the years, one of the high points that stand out include performing at the Acropolis with Yanni. [...] Imagine all these different cultures coming together with the challenges of language, equipment, travel, and weather problems. [...] I still picture the police running their dogs through the dressing rooms to sniff out any bomb possibilities right before the show. [...] People still {{come up to me and}} comment how that show has affected their lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reading [...] a Midrash {{asked how}} many times Joseph was sold. [...] Rabbi Judan and Rav Huna disagreed. Rabbi Judan {{maintained}} that Joseph was sold four times: His brothers sold him to the Ishmaelites, the Ishmaelites to the merchants, the merchants to the Midianites, and the Midianites into Egypt. Rav Huna <b>said</b> <b>Joseph</b> was sold five times, concluding with the Midianites selling him to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians to Potiphar.|$|E
2500|$|Within hours, {{many nations}} and {{organizations}} had condemned the test. Expert U.S. analysts {{do not believe}} that a hydrogen bomb was detonated. Seismic data collected so far suggests a 6–9 kiloton yield and that magnitude is not consistent with the power that would be generated by a hydrogen bomb explosion. [...] "What we're speculating is they tried to do a boosted nuclear device, which is an atomic bomb that has a little bit of hydrogen, an isotope in it called tritium," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Joseph</b> Cirincione, president of the global security firm Ploughshares Fund. The German source which estimates for all the North Korea's past nuclear test has instead made an initial estimation of 14kt, which is about the same (revised) yield as its previous nuclear test in 2013. However the yield estimation for January 2016 nuclear test was revised to 10kt in the subsequent nuclear test from North Korea.|$|E
2500|$|David Lewis relates “Although we {{had been}} counseled by Joseph the Prophet to leave the mill and go to Far West, but being deceived by the {{messenger}} we sent him for council, we understood it not, for our messenger said to Joseph what shall we do {{that is at the}} mill, Joseph said gather up all of you and come to Far West. [...] "What?" [...] said the messenger, whose name was Jacob Hawn, the owner of mill, [...] "leave the mill and let it be burnt down? We think we can maintain it." [...] "If you maintain it" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Joseph,</b> [...] "you will do well do as you please." [...] The messenger returned and said if we thought we could maintain the mill it was Joseph’s council for us to do it, if we thought not, to come to Far West and we thought from the way the thing was represented it would be like cowards to leave and not try to maintain it, and as they agreed to be at peace we thought to gather up our houses would be useless, for we did not know that it was Joseph’s decided council for us to do so [...] [...] [...]” ...|$|E
