5|$|Croatia has a {{universal}} health care system, whose roots {{can be traced back}} to the Hungarian-Croatian Parliament Act of 1891, providing a form of mandatory insurance of all factory workers and craftsmen. The population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided by statute and optional insurance. In 2012, annual healthcare related expenditures reached 21.0billion kuna (€2.8billion).

5|$|After a {{bruising}} primary {{battle with}} another incumbent whose district was combined with his, in which McEwen faced charges of bouncing checks on the House bank, he narrowly lost the 1992 general election to Democrat Ted Strickland. Following an unsuccessful {{run in the}} adjacent Second District in 1993, McEwen was largely absent from the Ohio political scene for a decade, until in 2005 he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Congress in the Second District special election to replace Rob Portman, who beat him in 1993, and finished second to the winner in the general election, Jean Schmidt. McEwen's 2005 platform was familiar from his past campaigns, advocating a pro-life stance, defending Second Amendment rights, and promising to limit taxes and government <b>spending.</b> <b>In</b> 2006, he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in the Second District.|$|E
5|$|At {{a luncheon}} with the St. John's Board of Trade in February 2012, Dunderdale {{delivered}} a speech which {{laid out a}} more fiscally conservative course.

Dunderdale said that there would be virtually no new <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> the upcoming provincial budget, that government departments were told to find savings and that she had ordered an audit of all government programs. She also said that her goal in the next decade is to radically decrease Newfoundland and Labrador's debt load and to achieve the same per capita debt as the Canadian average. Fiscal restraint was again the key message in the March 5, 2011, speech from the throne. The speech announced that all government departments and programs were under review. Dunderdale later stated that her government was looking for $100 million in savings for the upcoming fiscal year and that key services were exempt from cuts.|$|E

5|$|By {{executive}} order, Bevin required {{all state}} agencies to reduce <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> their current budgets by 4.5 percent. House Speaker Greg Stumbo argued that Bevin {{did not have}} the authority to order such reductions without legislative approval, but Senate President Robert Stivers defended Bevin's action, saying it amounted to simply not spending money that was previously allocated. Bevin later compromised with the state's public college and university presidents to reduce the cuts to 2 percent, but Attorney General Andy Beshear sued to stop the cuts entirely. On May 18, 2016, a Franklin Circuit Court judge ruled Bevin did have the authority to make the cuts. The Kentucky Supreme Court accepted the case on appeal, granting Beshear's request to bypass the Kentucky Court of Appeals for expediency. A hearing before the Supreme Court occurred on August 18. On September 21, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a 5–2 decision reversing the Franklin Circuit Court ruling and agreeing with Beshear that Bevin {{did not have the}} authority to make mid-year budget cuts without the approval of the General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, the {{national}} media began to report the extreme wealth of some Texans in magazines such as Life and Fortune. A stereotype emerged of the nouveau-riche Texas oil millionaire, popularized by the media. The popular image was often characterized by a rough and combative personality, heavy drinking, and extravagant <b>spending.</b> <b>In</b> 1956, the motion picture Giant helped to crystallize the image of Texans in the popular imagination as comical, eccentric figures. Glenn McCarthy was {{the inspiration for the}} character of Jett Rink in the film. Other films such as Boom Town and War of the Wildcats, and books such as The Lusty Texans of Dallas and Houston: Land of the Big Rich, also contributed to public perceptions of oil's influence in Texas and surrounding states.|$|E

Renovations began in August2009 and were funded by $9.3million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The station was cited by U.S. Senator Tom Coburn as an example of pork barrel <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> the stimulus bill. Elevators were built and the station's two platforms were raised, per the requirements of Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The platforms were also lengthened to accommodate longer trains. Canopies were erected over the platforms to provide protection from the elements for waiting passengers. The station building was completely remodeled, including restoration of the original wood furnishings, replacement of broken slate roof tiles, and masonry repointing. The completed station was unveiled in a ribbon-cutting ceremony on May4, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Just as the Jeddah Tower will {{complement}} the Jeddah Economic City development {{that will be}} built around it, there are many infrastructure and revitalization projects underway and planned throughout Saudi Arabia, such as the US$7.2 billion (SR27.1 billion) new airport terminal under construction at King Abdulaziz (Jeddah) International Airport, that will {{complement the}} Jeddah Economic City as well as develop Saudi Arabia, which has been likened to a Third World country with crumbling infrastructure and widespread disasters, including severe flooding, such as the flash floods in early 2011 that damaged 90% of the roads and over 27,000 buildings in Jeddah. According to a representative of Standard Chartered, which invested US$75 million in Saudi Binladin Group, Saudi Arabia is going to spend over US$400 billion (SR1.5 trillion) on infrastructure {{over the next few}} years. According to reports by Citi Investment Research & Analysis, $220 billion worth of development, accounting for 36% of all construction <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> the MENA region, will be directly or indirectly beneficial to Jeddah Tower. Jeddah Tower and City themselves are intended to set an example of green development, using modern technology and having a low carbon footprint relative to the number of people they will support. However, there is also an increasing problem of poor education levels in Arab countries {{due to a lack of}} <b>spending</b> <b>in</b> research and education, which it is argued should be invested in rather than building skyscrapers, and that the tower is nothing more than a symbol of hubris.
