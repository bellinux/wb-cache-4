5|$|It {{consists}} of a horizontal bar or bars suspended at the depth of intended decompression stops by buoys. The bars are of <b>sufficient</b> weight and the buoys of <b>sufficient</b> buoyancy that the trapeze will not easily change depth in turbulent water or if the divers experience buoyancy control problems.|$|E

5|$|A {{decompression}} trapeze is {{a device}} used in recreational diving and technical diving to make decompression stops {{more comfortable and}} more secure and provide the divers' surface cover with a visual reference for the divers' position. It consists of a horizontal bar or bars suspended at the depth of intended decompression stops by buoys. The bars are of <b>sufficient</b> weight and the buoys of <b>sufficient</b> buoyancy that the trapeze will not easily change depth in turbulent water or if the divers experience buoyancy control problems.|$|E

5|$|Exceedingly {{small amounts}} of tomato systemin are active, femto-molar {{concentrations}} of the peptide are <b>sufficient</b> to elicit a response at the whole plant level, {{making it one of}} the most potent gene activators identified.|$|E
5|$|Floyd {{worked hard}} on Jackson's behalf and {{considered}} his efforts <b>sufficient</b> for a {{post in the}} new cabinet, and so declined to run again for Congress. However, he did not receive this post.|$|E
5|$|For lexical-gustatory synesthesia {{evidence}} {{also points}} towards ideasthesia: In lexical-gustatory synesthesia, verbalisation {{of the stimulus}} is not necessary for the experience of concurrents. Instead, it is <b>sufficient</b> to activate the concept.|$|E
5|$|Four {{anatomic}} features must {{be present}} for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full {{range of motion}} of the temporomandibular joint), <b>sufficient</b> pharyngeal space (determined by examining {{the back of the}} mouth), <b>sufficient</b> submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space into which the tongue must be displaced in order for the larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables is in any way compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.|$|E
5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single <b>sufficient</b> interest test for all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a <b>sufficient</b> interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} mandatory order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders. In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the <b>sufficient</b> interest test for mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a mandatory order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that the test for standing was whether the applicant had a <b>sufficient</b> interest in the subject matter, and not whether he or she had a specific legal right.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to gain an accurate picture of incidence and prevalence of self-harm. This is due in a part {{to a lack of}} <b>sufficient</b> numbers of dedicated research centres to provide a continuous monitoring system. However, even with <b>sufficient</b> resources, statistical estimates are crude since most incidences of self-harm are undisclosed to the medical profession as acts of self-harm are frequently carried out in secret, and wounds may be superficial and easily treated by the individual. Recorded figures can be based on three sources: psychiatric samples, hospital admissions and general population surveys.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of neurological symptoms, Kayser–Fleischer rings {{and a low}} ceruloplasmin level is considered <b>sufficient</b> for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. In many cases, however, further tests are needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} mercury {{took some time}} – the latent period between {{ingestion}} and the first symptoms (typically paresthesia – numbness in the extremities) was between 16 and 38 days. Paresthesia was the predominant symptom in less serious cases. Worse cases included ataxia (typically loss of balance), blindness or reduced vision, and death resulting from central nervous system failure. Anywhere between 20 and 40mg of mercury has been suggested as <b>sufficient</b> for paresthesia (between 0.5 and 0.8mg/kg of body weight). On average, individuals affected consumed 20kg or so of bread; the 73,000 tonnes provided would have been <b>sufficient</b> for over 3 million cases.|$|E
