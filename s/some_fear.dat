5|$|Although {{there was}} <b>some</b> <b>fear</b> of Rome and concern with her methods, the {{coalition}} arrayed against Philip continued to grow. As allowed {{for by the}} treaty, Pergamon, Elis and Messenia, followed by Sparta, all agreed to join the alliance against Macedon. The Roman fleet, together with the Pergamene fleet, controlled the sea, and Macedon and her allies were threatened on land {{by the rest of}} the coalition. The Roman strategy of encumbering Philip with a war among Greeks in Greece was succeeding, so much so that when Laevinus went to Rome to take up his consulship, he was able to report that the legion deployed against Philip could be safely withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|The ceasefire of 2004 brought {{relative}} peace, {{but in the}} meantime, {{the sinking}} of the Joola in 2002 claimed the lives of many inhabitants of Carabane and curtailed much of its ability to engage in trade and accept tourists for several years. Considering the problems brought on by the conflict along with the threat of coastal erosion on the island, <b>some</b> <b>fear</b> the worst. Thus, after years of development and community outreach, Carabane is experiencing difficulties in a number of ways.|$|E
25|$|The Washington County Chamber of Commerce {{gave their}} 2007 Citizen of the Year award to the Friends, {{due to the}} {{restoration}} of the mill. There is <b>some</b> <b>fear</b> that restoration of the mill by using cave water may affect the ecology of the cave, in particular its blind fish. Beck's Mill is set to be reopened for the public on September 20, 2008, to coincide with the Old Settler's Days festival in Salem.|$|E

25|$|Another scholar drew a {{connection}} between the microwave scene and urban legends about pets dying in microwave ovens. He described the portrayal of this urban legend in the film as successful, but that meant it seemed terrible. This is indeed a scene that is thought of as being one of the film's most violent depictions; with even Roger Ebert expressing <b>some</b> <b>fear</b> in his review that the film might encourage children to try similar things with their pets.|$|E
25|$|Operation Goodwood was {{launched}} {{at a time}} of great frustration in the higher command of the Allies, which contributed to the controversy surrounding the operation. The Allied bridgehead was about 20 percent of the planned size, which led to congestion and <b>some</b> <b>fear</b> of a stalemate. Allied commanders {{had not been able to}} exploit their potentially decisive advantages in mobility during June and early July 1944. Much of the controversy surrounding the objectives of the battle originates from the conflicting messages given by Montgomery. He talked up the objectives of Goodwood to the press on the first day, later saying that this was propaganda to encourage the Germans to keep powerful units at the east end of the battlefield.|$|E
25|$|An Ottoman army under Gedik Ahmed Pasha invaded Italy in 1480, {{capturing}} Otranto. Because {{of lack of}} food, Gedik Ahmed Pasha {{returned with}} most of his troops to Albania, leaving a garrison of 800 infantry and 500 cavalry behind to defend Otranto in Italy. It was assumed he would return after the winter. Since it was only 28 years {{after the fall of}} Constantinople, there was <b>some</b> <b>fear</b> that Rome would suffer the same fate. Plans were made for the Pope and citizens of Rome to evacuate the city. Pope Sixtus IV repeated his 1471 call for a crusade. Several Italian city-states, Hungary, and France responded positively to the appeal. The Republic of Venice did not, however, as it had signed an expensive peace treaty with the Ottomans in 1479.|$|E
50|$|Reportedly the {{military}} was split. There {{was said to be}} a power struggle between Prabowo and Wiranto. Both generals claimed to be loyal to Suharto. <b>Some</b> <b>feared</b> factionalism could lead to a civil war.|$|R
60|$|Such, {{for half}} an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only once by Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to inquire if he were come--and {{she was a little}} uneasy.--She had <b>some</b> <b>fears</b> of his horse.|$|R

25|$|The {{use of the}} x86 {{architecture}} allows Windows to run natively on Apple hardware, {{and opens}} {{the possibility of using}} the Wine package to run Windows executables directly. <b>Some</b> <b>fear</b> that the change will make Mac OS X a less valuable target for software developers, since Mac OS X users can use a dual-boot setup or a Wine variant (such as CrossOver Mac or Darwine) to run Windows apps instead. Others say that it could be a boon to switchers, since they would not have to leave their Windows applications behind while trying out Mac OS X. The idea of Mac OS X being available on regular PCs has also been discussed, but Apple has said that they will not allow regular PCs to run Mac OS X. The OSx86 Project, however, is able to install Mac OS X on non-Apple PCs. It was previously thought that since Windows XP is incompatible with the Extensible Firmware Interface, it would not be run on Intel-based Macs. Prior to the Boot Camp announcement, a prize contest resulted in a working solution for dual-booting Windows XP and Mac OS X on an Intel Mac. Microsoft has announced that Windows Vista will not be EFI-compatible on 32-bit platforms, but the later versions of Boot Camp allow Vista to be installed on any Intel Mac.|$|E
2500|$|On October 29, Judge Sewall wrote, [...] "the Court of Oyer and Terminer count {{themselves}} thereby dismissed ... {{asked whether}} the Court of Oyer and Terminer should sit, expressing <b>some</b> <b>fear</b> of Inconvenience by its fall, [...] Governour said it must fall". Perhaps by coincidence, Governor Phips' own wife, Lady Mary Phips, {{was among those who}} had been [...] "called out upon" [...] around this time. After Phips' order, there were no more executions.|$|E
2500|$|Child-safety {{advocate}} Marc Klaas {{has come}} out publicly in support of Perverted-Justice and the work they do, suggesting that they go {{from city to city}} with their efforts. [...] "I think if you were to take this 'Dateline' piece {{and turn it into a}} regular program, where Perverted-Justice and Chris Hansen or somebody else were to go from city to city to city on a weekly basis, you would create a real deterrent effect that would put <b>some</b> <b>fear</b> into the minds of these perverts." ...|$|E

25|$|National Hispanic and immigration-advocacy {{groups were}} also split, with <b>some</b> <b>fearing</b> that the actions would provoke a backlash. The League of United Latin American Citizens, {{normally}} a moderate organization, {{was one of}} the few to fully support both the boycott and the strike.|$|R
50|$|Support for the {{constitution}} was strong {{throughout the country}} and among all major ethnic groups, despite a relatively low voter turnout in the south of the country and <b>some</b> <b>fears</b> that a parliamentary system would be weaker than a single strong president.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>fear</b> {{contagion}} {{through the}} handling involved in distributing the hosts to the communicants, {{even if they}} are placed on the hand rather than on the tongue. Accordingly, some churches use mechanical wafer dispensers or [...] "pillow packs" [...] (communion wafers with wine inside them). While these methods of distributing communion are not accepted in Catholic Church parishes, one such church provides a mechanical dispenser to allow those intending to communicate to place in a bowl, without touching them by hand, the hosts for use in the celebration.|$|E
2500|$|Observers in {{neighboring}} countries {{have mixed feelings}} of the overall deforestation of the Congo Basin. <b>Some</b> <b>fear</b> of famine as “farmers prefer to cut trees down to make charcoal and sell it ... rather than wait two years to harvest a field of cassava”. Also {{as a result of}} deforestation, hunting has decreased locally as animals are forced to move to new areas. Yet, others view the deforestation as simply a means of survival. Selling firewood can bring the equivalent of $1000 each month for those farmers able to produce one hundred 15-kilo sacks which sell for approximately $10 in most areas.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{critics of}} {{transhumanism}} {{see the old}} eugenics, social Darwinist, and master race ideologies and programs of the past as warnings of what the promotion of eugenic enhancement technologies might unintentionally encourage. <b>Some</b> <b>fear</b> future [...] "eugenics wars" [...] as the worst-case scenario: the return of coercive state-sponsored genetic discrimination and human rights violations such as compulsory sterilization of persons with genetic defects, {{the killing of the}} institutionalized and, specifically, segregation and genocide of races perceived as inferior. Health law professor George Annas and technology law professor Lori Andrews are prominent advocates of the position that the use of these technologies could lead to such human-posthuman caste warfare.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>feared</b> that Home Rule {{would become}} [...] "Rome Rule" [...] under an oppressive and {{socially}} dominant Roman Catholic Church. They feared {{that they would}} experience discrimination, including legal disabilities analogous to those imposed on Catholics and dissenting Protestants under the old Penal Laws.|$|R
5000|$|Legislators {{were unable}} or unwilling to address either slave-owners' {{concerns}} about losing their [...] "investment", or white citizens' concerns that if slavery were abolished, freed slaves could become a burden on the community. <b>Some</b> <b>feared</b> that escaped slaves from elsewhere would flood the state.|$|R
2500|$|An {{additional}} {{feature of}} concern to the new Google privacy policy {{is the nature of}} the policy. One must accept all features or delete existing Google accounts. The update will affect the Google+ social network, therefore making Google+’s settings uncustomizable, unlike other customizable social networking sites. Customizing the privacy settings of a social network is a key tactic that many feel is necessary for social networking sites. This update in the system has some Google+ users wary of continuing service. [...] Additionally, <b>some</b> <b>fear</b> the sharing of data amongst Google services could lead to revelations of identities. Many using pseudonyms are concerned about this possibility, and defend the role of pseudonyms in literature and history.|$|E
2500|$|Media personalities {{have weighed}} in on the confrontations. During the standoff, Bundy was interviewed (via remote link) by {{television}} host Sean Hannity. Hannity stated that <b>some</b> <b>fear</b> events could wind up mirroring the Waco siege and Ruby Ridge and said, [...] "This is public land, and it's not being used, in my mind, and I'm not a rancher, (but) I would think the federal government might be thankful because you're cutting the lawn for free, and they're charging huge amounts of money, right, to let your cattle graze there with these fees". In contrast, a comparison of BLM grazing fees with private land market prices demonstrated the Bundy's are getting a 93% discount by grazing on BLM land.|$|E
2500|$|The {{common law}} tort of {{trespass}} to chattels has been invoked {{in the modern}} context of electronic communications to combat the proliferation of unsolicited bulk email, commonly known as spam. [...] In addition, several companies have successfully used the tort to block certain people, usually competitors, from accessing their servers. Though courts initially endorsed a broad application of this legal theory in the electronic context, more recently other jurists have narrowed its scope. As trespass to chattels is extended further to computer networks, <b>some</b> <b>fear</b> that plaintiffs are using this cause of action to quash fair competition and to deter the exercise of free speech; consequently, critics call for the limitation of the tort to instances where the plaintiff can demonstrate actual damages.|$|E
50|$|Notwithstanding the river’s {{irregular}} flow, some {{agriculture is}} {{undertaken in the}} Swakop River valley, thus the region {{is well known for}} its fresh produce, especially tomatoes, asparagus and olives. There are <b>some</b> <b>fears</b> of salt and uranium (possibly natural, possibly from the Rössing uranium mine) endangering this farming industry.|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{had bought}} a musical box at Antwerp, and he had <b>some</b> <b>fears</b> lest he might be obliged to pay a duty upon it, in going into Holland. Mr. George {{had told him that}} he thought there was some danger, but Rollo {{concluded}} that he would take the risk.|$|R
50|$|From the beginning, <b>some</b> <b>feared</b> {{that the}} theater {{would have a}} demoralizing effect on the town. During opening night, several seats were left vacant in protest. In the 1920s, Red Wing church groups took their {{concerns}} to the city council. They petitioned, unsuccessfully, for greater censorship and for Sunday shows to be discontinued.|$|R
2500|$|The city of Bellaire, {{located in}} Ohio across the Ohio River {{from the state}} of Virginia and the city Wheeling, assumed some {{strategic}} importance because of the railroads {{on both sides of the}} river and the fact that the Ohio River served as the border between the state of Ohio (pro-Union) and the state of Virginia (voted to secede from the Union). [...] Bellaire became a staging area for Ohio and Indiana Union troops to cross into the South and move by rail using the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. [...] There was <b>some</b> <b>fear</b> that rebels from Virginia would cross into Ohio through Bellaire. [...] A training camp was located in the city, and numerous soldiers passed through the town to fight in the south. [...] It is therefore not surprising that 17-year-old Henry Crimmel enlisted to fight in the Civil War. [...] Many of the workers at South Wheeling's Hobbs Glass works also enlisted.|$|E
2500|$|It {{would not}} be until the 9th May 1942 that the INA would come into full effect. However, {{following}} the events of Farrer Park, Indians in Singapore begun to enjoy special privileges during the Japanese ‘pacification’ of Singapore [...] The Japanese treated the Indians and Chinese differently during this period. During these early months, {{it was reported that}} roughly [...] 50 000 Chinese in Singapore and the Malayan Peninsula were brutally killed in what is now known as the ‘Sook Ching Massacre’ [...] In contrast, the Indians received far more lenient treatment. However, {{this is not to say}} that the Indians felt no fear at all. In fact, the attitudes of the Japanese forces towards the Chinese population did instil <b>some</b> <b>fear</b> in the general Indian civilian population as well as leaders such as Pritam Singh. This was significant or the Indian leaders, during the Farrer Park meeting who had expressed reservations about collaborating with the Japanese as these incidents further cemented their initial beliefs about the cruel nature of the Japanese and would further affirm their decision to not join the INA in May 1942.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{days after}} Kennedy's speech, the Chinese People's Daily {{announced}} that [...] "650,000,000 Chinese {{men and women}} were standing by the Cuban people." [...] In West Germany, newspapers supported the US's response by contrasting it with the weak American actions in the region during the preceding months. They also expressed <b>some</b> <b>fear</b> that the Soviets might retaliate in Berlin. In France on October 23, the crisis made the front page of all the daily newspapers. The next day, an editorial in Le Monde expressed doubt about the authenticity of the CIA's photographic evidence. Two days later, after a visit by a high-ranking CIA agent, the newspaper accepted the validity of the photographs. Also in France, in the October 29 issue of Le Figaro, Raymond Aron wrote in support of the American response. On October 24, Pope John XXIII sent a message to the Soviet embassy in Rome to be transmitted to the Kremlin in which he voiced his concern for peace. In this message he stated, [...] "We beg all governments not to remain deaf to this cry of humanity. That they do all that is in their power to save peace." ...|$|E
50|$|On 7 and 9 August 1748, {{the great}} hall hosted public gatherings of the Doelisten, a local protest group of mostly merchants {{opposing}} the perceived nepotism of the well-to-do who dominated Amsterdam's city government. The crowds that gathered in the hall were so large, <b>some</b> <b>feared</b> that the floor would collapse under the weight.|$|R
25|$|The {{church of}} Sant'Ignazio {{remained}} unfinished with bare ceilings even after its consecration in 1642. Disputes {{with the original}} donors, the Ludovisi, prevented {{the completion of the}} planned dome. Pozzo expediently proposed to make an illusionistic dome, when viewed from inside, by painting on canvas. It was impressive to viewers, but controversial; <b>some</b> <b>feared</b> the canvas would soon darken.|$|R
2500|$|The Ministry of Defence {{subsequently}} capped {{the number}} of recruits from Commonwealth countries at 10% of any corps or regiment in the Army, although this {{did not affect the}} Gurkhas. The cap was debated, as <b>some</b> <b>feared</b> the army's [...] "Britishness" [...] was being diluted, and employing too many could make the army seem as employing too many mercenaries.|$|R
