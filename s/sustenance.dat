5|$|In Yellowstone's hot waters, {{bacteria}} form mats {{of bizarre}} shapes consisting of trillions of individuals. These bacteria {{are some of}} the most primitive life forms on earth. Flies and other arthropods live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters. Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained <b>sustenance</b> only from sulfur. In 2005 researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder discovered that the <b>sustenance</b> for at least some of the diverse hyperthermophilic species is molecular hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Neolithic petroglyphs from Asia depict antler-less female elk, {{which have}} been {{interpreted}} as symbolizing rebirth and <b>sustenance.</b> By {{the beginning of the}} Bronze Age, the elk is depicted less frequently in rock art, coinciding with a cultural transformation away from hunting.|$|E
5|$|Humans employ {{nature for}} both leisure and {{economic}} activities. The acquisition {{of natural resources}} for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both <b>sustenance</b> and leisure, often by different people. Agriculture was first adopted around the 9th millennium BCE. Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of insect life provided some food for birds, and birds in turn helped many species to become established on the island. The bodies of dead birds provide <b>sustenance</b> for carnivorous insects, while the fertilisation {{of the soil}} and resulting promotion of plant life provides a viable habitat for herbivorous insects.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the post-communist period, the {{pharmaceutical}} industry has mainly been an obstacle to reform. Aiming to explore the vast market of the former USSR, they used the situation to make professionals and services totally dependent on their financial <b>sustenance,</b> turned the major attention to the availability of medicines rather than that of psycho-social rehabilitation services, and stimulated corruption within the mental health sector very much.|$|E
5|$|Cookie {{cutting and}} decorating reached its {{cultural}} zenith during the boomer years with Christmas cookie cutouts of reindeer, trees, stars, and bells providing <b>sustenance</b> {{for kids and}} dads. Moms packed their favorite home baked cookies into Tupperware containers and carried them to cookie swap parties with friends and neighbors. Red plastic cutters replaced tin cutters {{during the war years}} when metal was scarce and can be found today at garage sales and flea markets.|$|E
5|$|High {{reveals that}} two humans, Líf and Lífþrasir, will have also survived the {{destruction}} by {{hiding in the}} wood Hoddmímis holt. These two survivors consume the morning dew for <b>sustenance,</b> and from their descendants {{the world will be}} repopulated. Vafþrúðnismál stanza 45 is then quoted. The personified sun, Sól, will have a daughter at least as beautiful as she, and this daughter will follow the same path as her mother. Vafþrúðnismál stanza 47 is quoted, and so ends the foretelling of Ragnarök in Gylfaginning.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after hatching, turtles are {{dependent}} on egg yolk material for <b>sustenance.</b> About a week to {{a week and a}} half after emerging from their eggs (or the following spring if emergence is delayed), hatchlings begin feeding to support growth. The young turtles grow rapidly at first, sometimes doubling their size in the first year. Growth slows sharply at sexual maturity and may stop completely. Likely owing to differences of habitat and food by water body, growth rates often differ from population to population in the same area. Among the subspecies, the western painted turtles are the quickest growers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are over}} 3,000 {{registered}} hunters on Hawaii island, and hunting, for both recreation and <b>sustenance,</b> {{is a common}} activity on Mauna Kea. A public hunting program is used to control the numbers of introduced animals including pigs, sheep, goats, turkey, pheasants, and quail. The Mauna Kea State Recreation Area functions as a base camp for the sport. Birdwatching is also common at lower levels on the mountain. A popular site is Kīpuka Pu'u Huluhulu, a kīpuka on Mauna Kea's flank that formed when lava flows isolated the forest on a hill.|$|E
5|$|We wretched and needy men reverently give thee thanks, almighty God, heavenly Father, for {{the food}} which thou hast sanctified and {{bestowed}} for the <b>sustenance</b> of the body, {{so that we may}} use it thankfully; {{at the same time we}} beseech thee that thou wouldst impart to us the food of angels, the true bread of heaven, the eternal word of God, Jesus Christ our Lord, so that our mind may feed on him and that through his flesh and blood we may be nourished, sustained and strengthened.|$|E
5|$|By {{early spring}} of 1794, the {{situation}} in France was dire. With famine looming after {{the failure of the}} harvest and the blockade of French ports and trade, the French government was forced to look overseas for <b>sustenance.</b> Turning to France's colonies in the Americas, and the agricultural bounty of the United States, the National Convention gave orders for the formation of a large convoy of sailing vessels to gather at Hampton Roads in the Chesapeake Bay, where Admiral Vanstabel would wait for them. According to contemporary historian William James this conglomeration of ships was said to be over 350 strong, although he disputes this figure, citing the number as 117 (in addition to the French warships).|$|E
5|$|Cantillon {{is one of}} the few economists {{cited by}} Adam Smith, who {{directly}} borrows Cantillon's <b>sustenance</b> theory of wages. Large sections of Smith's economic theory were possibly directly influenced by Cantillon, although in many respects Adam Smith advanced well beyond the scope of Cantillon. Some economic historians have argued that Adam Smith provided little of value from his own intellect, notably Schumpeter and Rothbard. In any case, through his influence on Adam Smith and the physiocrats, Cantillon was quite possibly the pre-classical economist who contributed most to the ideas of the classical school. Illustrative of this was Cantillon's influence on Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter's Treatise on Political Economy.|$|E
5|$|DayZ {{attempts}} to portray a realistic scenario within the gameplay, {{with the environment}} having different effects on the player. A character may receive bone fractures from damage to their legs, go into shock from bullet wounds or zombie bites, receive infections from zombies or diseased players, or faint due to low blood pressure. Thirst and hunger must be kept under control by finding <b>sustenance</b> in either cities or the wilderness, with body temperature playing a key part in the character's survival. The game focuses on surviving and the human elements of a zombie apocalypse by forcing the player to acknowledge basic human needs like thirst, hunger and shelter. These mechanics require the player to focus on immediate goals before they can consider long-term strategies.|$|E
5|$|Encountered singly or in groups, the thornback {{guitarfish}} {{feeds on}} small, benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the developing young drawing <b>sustenance</b> from a yolk sac. Females {{give birth to}} 1–15 pups annually in late summer, following a roughly year-long gestation period. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the thornback guitarfish under Least Concern {{because the majority of}} its range lies within United States waters, where it is common since it has no commercial value and is not heavily fished commercially or recreationally. The status of this species in Mexican waters is inadequately known but may be more precarious.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Felix's {{party is}} able to achieve {{entrance}} into Piers' home, a legendary, secluded Atlantis-like society named Lemuria far out in the ocean. When they convene with Lemuria's ancient king, Hydros, they learn about Alchemy's true nature; {{it has always been}} the <b>sustenance</b> of Weyard's very life force, and its absence over the past ages has caused the world's continents to decrease in size and parts of the world to collapse into the abyss. Knowing that restoring Alchemy is what must be done to actually save the world, Felix crosses the sea in order to activate Jupiter Lighthouse. But when Isaac's pursuing party enters the lighthouse, they are trapped and ambushed by Karst and Agatio. Felix rescues Isaac, but Karst and Agatio escape with the Mars Star formerly in Isaac's possession.|$|E
5|$|Invasive plants include {{fountain}} grass, tamarisk, Malta starthistle, {{and many}} others, but {{by far the}} most severe threat to the native ecosystem is buffelgrass. This drought-tolerant plant, native to parts of Africa and Asia, was imported to the United States in the 1930s and planted near Tucson and elsewhere to create cattle forage and to control erosion. First detected in the park in 1989, it has dispersed widely in both districts. Competing with other plants for <b>sustenance,</b> buffelgrass fills the empty spaces normally found between native desert plants and creates a significant fire hazard. The noxious weed, considered impossible to completely eliminate, is managed in some areas of the park and in Tucson residential zones by hand-pulling and, during periods of wet weather, application of glyphosate-based herbicides.|$|E
5|$|Like in Sandakan, {{people in}} Tawau have always {{relied on the}} sea for their <b>sustenance.</b> Every day, {{hundreds}} of deep sea trawlers and tuckboats {{can be seen at}} the Cowie Bay. Barter trade also happens in the sea area around Tawau. The Tawau marine zone are one of Sabah four marine zones, with the other been in Sandakan, Kudat and the west coast. A great variety of high-grade fishes and all kinds of crustaceans were found in abundance in the sea and waterways around Tawau. Prawn farming has become largest sea economic source for the district. The oldest and largest prawn farm were located in this area together with six frozen shrimp processing plants.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Francesca Tinti {{has arrived}} at a {{different}} conclusion, arguing instead that Hemming's work, {{more so than the}} Liber Wigorniensis, came to serve very real needs, and that these specifically concerned the monastic community at Worcester. Although the Prefatio is silent about monks, the Enucleatio is explicit that Bishop Wulfstan had commissioned the work to defend the estates assigned for the <b>sustenance</b> of the monks (ad victum monachorum). She relates these concerns to the rapid growth of the community during Bishop Wulfstan's episcopate {{in the second half of}} the 11th century. The coming of the Norman newcomer, Samson, who had been involved in the dissolution of Westbury-on-Trym, would have given the enlarged community a particular incentive to safeguard its property and rights.|$|E
5|$|Pemberton was {{boxed in}} {{with lots of}} munitions and little food. The poor diet was showing on the Confederate soldiers. By the end of June, half were out sick or hospitalized. Scurvy, malaria, dysentery, diarrhea, and other {{diseases}} cut their ranks. At least one city resident had to stay up at night to keep starving soldiers out of his vegetable garden. The constant shelling did not bother {{him as much as}} the loss of his food. As the siege wore on, fewer and fewer horses, mules, and dogs were seen wandering about Vicksburg. Shoe leather became a last resort of <b>sustenance</b> for many adults.|$|E
5|$|Pushkar city, with a {{population}} of 14,791 at the 2001 census, {{is one of the oldest}} cities in India. The city lies on the shore of Pushkar Lake. The date of its actual origin is not known, but legend associates Brahma with its creation concurrent with the lake; Brahma is said to have performed penance here for a darshan (sight) of god Vishnu. Thus, its uniqueness lies in the fact of its historic-religious-cultural background, and as a result it attracts approximately 100,000 visitors every month, apart from the very large congregation that occurs during the annual Pushkar Fair. However, the Pushkar Lake is central to its <b>sustenance</b> as a religious centre. The tourist arrivals during 2005 were reported to be about 16.12 million (said to be the maximum among all tourist attractions in Rajasthan), out of which the foreign tourists were about 63,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of the}} circumstellar {{habitable}} zone {{was introduced}} in 1953 by Hubertus Strughold and Harlow Shapley and in 1959 by Su-Shu Huang as the region around a star in which an orbiting planet could retain water at its surface. From the 1970s, planetary scientists and astrobiologists began to consider various other factors required for the creation and <b>sustenance</b> of life, including the impact that a nearby supernova may have on life's development. In 1981, Jim Clarke proposed that the apparent lack of extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way {{could be explained by}} Seyfert-type outbursts from an active galactic nucleus, with Earth alone being spared from this radiation by virtue of its location in the galaxy. In the same year, Wallace Hampton Tucker analyzed galactic habitability in a more general context, but later work superseded his proposals.|$|E
5|$|Urban red foxes {{are most}} active at dusk and dawn, {{doing most of}} their hunting and {{scavenging}} at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, {{but they can be}} caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas {{as well as on the}} edges of a city, visiting at night for <b>sustenance.</b> While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one's home; they can become accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs.|$|E
5|$|While {{state of}} the art materials-handling methods were used, in some {{instances}} labour-saving machinery worked beside operations intended to maximise the labour content. <b>Sustenance</b> workers were employed chiefly for on-site preparation, road construction, foundation excavation, clearing timber from the reservoir basin, and on some concreting operations. Skilled workers were required on the dam for fixing the formwork where the concrete was poured. These workers were probably employed at normal day labour rates, the main employment method used on the project. Bulk handling of cement was also used {{for the first time in}} Australia, this saw a significant saving as opposed to bagged cement which was the standard practice of the day.|$|E
5|$|After {{his death}} Menkauhor enjoyed a funerary cult {{centered}} on his pyramid complex. The cult lasted {{at least until}} {{the second half of the}} Sixth Dynasty, nearly 150 years later. Provisions for this cult were produced in dedicated agricultural domains that were established during Menkauhor's lifetime. Products of these domains were delivered to Menkauhor's sun and mortuary temples and distributed to the priests of the cult, who could use them for their <b>sustenance</b> or their own funerary cults. Personified representations of Menkauhor's agricultural domains are depicted bringing offerings on the walls of the mastabas of these priests. Most of the depictions are located in Saqqara North, near the pyramid complex of Djoser. This area comprises the tombs of Neferiretptah, Raemankh, Duare, Iti, Sekhemnefer, Snofrunefer, Akhethotep, Ptahhotep and Qednes, all priests of the funerary cult of Menkauhor. Further tombs of priests of this cult are found to the north, in Abusir South, with the mastaba of Isesiseneb and Rahotep and in Giza.|$|E
5|$|Maximian {{realized}} {{that he could not}} immediately suppress the rogue commander, so in 287 he campaigned solely against tribes beyond the Rhine instead. As Carausius was allied to the Franks, Maximian's campaigns could be seen as an effort to deny the separatist emperor in Britain a basis of support on the mainland. The following spring, as Maximian prepared a fleet for an expedition against Carausius, Diocletian returned from the East to meet Maximian. The two emperors agreed on a joint campaign against the Alamanni. Diocletian invaded Germania through Raetia while Maximian progressed from Mainz. Each emperor burned crops and food supplies as he went, destroying the Germans' means of <b>sustenance.</b> The two men added territory to the empire and allowed Maximian to continue preparations against Carausius without further disturbance. On his return to the East, Diocletian managed what was probably another rapid campaign against the resurgent Sarmatians. No details survive, but surviving inscriptions indicate that Diocletian took the title Sarmaticus Maximus after 289.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians {{believed}} that a balanced relationship between people and animals was {{an essential element of}} the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole. Animals, both domesticated and wild, were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and <b>sustenance</b> to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. Poultry, such as ducks, geese, and pigeons, were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, and provided both honey and wax.|$|E
5|$|The female {{may begin}} feeding by biting off the male's head (as {{they do with}} regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's {{movements}} may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining <b>sustenance.</b> Later, this behavior {{appeared to be an}} artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating. Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of her front legs.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} feeds on a {{diverse range of}} {{invertebrates}} and small vertebrates, though plant matter does constitute {{a major part of}} its diet. It is known to eat beetles, including weevils, rove beetles, and click beetles from the genus Psephus, butterflies, ants from the genera Dorylus and Pachycondyla, grasshoppers, cockroaches from the family Blattidae, earwigs, caterpillars, ant-lions, silverfish, and earthworms. Small lizards, frogs, snails, and slugs are also eaten, as are crabs from the genus Potamon, fruits, flower buds, mosses, and leaves. Fish have also been identified as a prey item in Nigeria. At at least one nesting site, it relies heavily on the arthropods feeding on the bat guano near the cave for <b>sustenance,</b> while this behaviour has been reported to a lesser extent at other sites. It is known to regurgitate what it has eaten in pellet form. Overall, between 52 and 60 percent of the bird's diet is believed to be composed of animals. Rove beetle larvae and ants were the most frequently eaten prey in a study in Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|The {{litter size}} ranges {{from one to}} eight, with two to five being typical, {{increasing}} with female size. In Omanese waters, females on average outnumber males in a litter by more than 2:1, and all-female litters are not uncommon. Similar but less extreme sex imbalances have also been reported from litters of milk sharks off Senegal and eastern India. The reason for this imbalance is unknown, {{and it has not}} been observed in related species such as the Atlantic sharpnose shark (R. terraenovae). Gestation of the embryos takes around a year and proceeds in three phases. In the first phase, lasting two months to an embryonic length of , the embryo relies on yolk for <b>sustenance</b> and gas exchange occurs across its surface integument and possibly also the yolk sac. During the second phase, which also lasts for two months to an embryonic length of , the external gill filaments develop and the yolk sac begins to be resorbed, the embyo ingesting histotroph (a nutritious substance secreted by the mother) in the meantime. In the third phase, lasting six to eight months, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the fetus receives nourishment until birth.|$|E
5|$|The {{real-time}} strategy {{elements of}} Giants consist of base building and resource gathering, wherein the resources are small humanoids called 'Smarties'. There are {{a limited number}} of Smarties in a mission, and players must rush to gather them, or kidnap them from each other to gain an advantage. Players also gather <b>sustenance</b> for the Smarties to make them work; Meccaryn and Reaper players hunt the cattle-like Vimps for meat and souls respectively. The options in building a base are limited; players can neither choose the locations for the structures nor manage their workforce in detail. Players in control of Kabuto need not build a base, whereas the character gains strength and produces subordinate characters by hunting for food. Kabuto consumes Smarties to increase its size and power; at maximum size, he can produce smaller Tyrannosaurus-like units as subordinates. To restore his health, Kabuto eats Vimps and other units (player- and computer-controlled).|$|E
5|$|With Saturos and Menardi dead, Felix convinces Jenna and Kraden to {{join him}} on a quest to {{complete}} Saturos' original objective to activate the two remaining lighthouses that he failed to light. Joined by new companions Sheba and Piers, Felix and his party embark on an epic expedition while pursued by Isaac's party. Eventually, Felix's party is able to achieve entrance into a legendary, secluded Atlantis-like society named Lemuria far out in the ocean. When they convene with Lemuria's ancient king, Hydros, they learn about Alchemy's true nature: it is the <b>sustenance</b> of Weyard's very life force, and its absence over the past ages has caused the world's continents to decrease in size {{and parts of the}} world to collapse into the abyss. Armed with this new information, Felix manages to persuade Isaac and his party to join them, and together they fulfill the goal of releasing Alchemy and preventing Weyard's eventual decay.|$|E
5|$|Poorly {{developed}} handicraft {{and limited}} resources for metal working {{are characteristic of}} the communities of all early Slavic cultures. There were no major iron production centers, but metal founding techniques were known; among the metal objects occasionally found are iron knives and hooks, as well as bronze decorative items (as {{can be found in}} 7th-century finds in Haćki, Bielsk Podlaski County, a site of one of the earliest fortified settlements). The inventories of the typical small open settlements also normally include various utensils made of stone, horn and clay (including weights used for weaving). The settlements were arranged as clusters of cabins along river or stream valleys, but above their flood levels, they were usually irregular and typically faced south. The wooden frame or pillar-supported square houses covered with a straw roof had each sides of 2.5 to 4.5 meters in length. Fertile lowlands were sought, but also forested areas with diversified plant and animal environment to provide additional <b>sustenance.</b> The settlements were self-sufficient; the early Slavs functioned without significant long-distance trade. Potter's wheels were used from the turn of the 7th century on. Some villages larger than a few homes have been discovered in the Kraków-Nowa Huta region from the 6th to 9th century, for example a complex of 11 settlements on the left bank of the Vistula in the direction of Igołomia. The original furnishings of Slavic huts are difficult to determine, because equipment was often made of perishable materials such as wood, leather or fabrics. Free- standing clay dome stoves for bread baking have been found on some locations. Another large 6th– to 9th-century settlement complex existed in the vicinity of Głogów in Silesia.|$|E
5|$|The nesting {{specimen}} {{was found}} in a stratigraphic area indicating that oviraptorids preferred nesting near streams that provided soft, sandy substrate and food in environments that were otherwise xeric (receiving a small amount of moisture). Many oviraptorids have been found in brooding positions, indicating they may have brooded for relatively long periods, similar to modern birds such as the ostrich, emu, and black-breasted buzzard, which brood for more than 40 days with a limited supply of <b>sustenance.</b> Nesting in desert environments can be harmful to adults that stay in the nest for large parts of the day, and for eggs and nestlings, due to heat stress. The choice of nesting area may therefore have been a mechanism for successful incubation in extreme heat. It has also been suggested that the evolution of tail-feathers in oviraptorosaurs was an adaptation for shading and protecting eggs in their nests. That the second finger of ingeniine oviraptorids was reduced in size compared to the robust first finger may be explained by a change in function; it {{may be related to the}} presence of long wing feathers that were attached to the second finger. These wing feathers were probably used to protect the eggs during nesting. When the second finger began functioning as a feather support, its ability to grasp was reduced, and this function was taken over by the first finger, which therefore became more robust. The third finger was reduced in size, too, probably because it was positioned behind the wing feathers in a way where it would not be effective for grasping.|$|E
25|$|The {{method by}} which Cybersix obtains <b>sustenance</b> is {{different}} among the series' incarnations. In the comic book, Cybersix sucks <b>sustenance</b> directly from the neck of those she hunts {{as if she were}} a vampire; however, she does not have fangs, instead simply making a wound in the victim's neck with her teeth, then drinking the <b>Sustenance</b> that bleeds from it instead of blood. Conversely, in the animated series, Von Reichter's creations carry glowing vials of <b>Sustenance</b> with them, which Cybersix would open and drink.|$|E
25|$|Slaves {{can be an}} {{attractive}} investment because the slave-owner only needs to pay for <b>sustenance</b> and enforcement. This is sometimes lower than the wage-cost of free labourers, because free workers earn more than <b>sustenance,</b> in these cases slaves have positive price. When the cost of <b>sustenance</b> and enforcement exceeds the wage rate, slave-owning {{would no longer be}} profitable, and owners would simply release their slaves. Slaves are thus a more attractive investment in high-wage environments, and environments where enforcement is cheap, and less attractive in environments where the wage-rate is low and enforcement is expensive.|$|E
