5|$|As {{they hide}} {{in a parking}} lot, Kyle {{explains}} to Sarah that an artificial intelligence defense network, known as <b>Skynet,</b> will become self-aware {{in the near future}} and initiate a nuclear holocaust. Sarah's future son John will rally the survivors and lead a resistance movement against <b>Skynet</b> and its army of machines. With the Resistance on the verge of victory, <b>Skynet</b> sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John is born, to prevent the formation of the Resistance. The Terminator is an efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton and an external layer of living tissue that makes it appear human.|$|E

5|$|John pleads with General Ashdown {{to delay}} the {{offensive}} so he can formulate a plan to extract the human captives, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However, the Resistance disobeys Ashdown's orders and instead, await John's signal. Marcus enters the base, interfaces with the computer, and disables perimeter defenses so that Connor can infiltrate the cellblock and release human prisoners. Wright learns from <b>Skynet</b> (which assumes the form of Dr. Kogan on a screen), that he was created and built from the original Wright's corpse to lure John to the base; when the Resistance launches its attack, John will be killed, achieving the goal that <b>Skynet</b> had failed to accomplish in the past. The hidden signal that the Resistance received earlier is revealed {{to have been a}} ruse, and <b>Skynet</b> uses it to track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance's leaders aboard.|$|E

50|$|In The Terminator: Tempest <b>Skynet's</b> {{master control}} has been {{destroyed}} in 2029. The Resistance believed this would cause the entire defense network to collapse into chaos without a leader. However, <b>Skynet's</b> many network complexes continued {{to fight the war}} as they did not need a leader to function and thus couldn't surrender.|$|R

5|$|John {{returns to}} the Resistance {{headquarters}} located aboard a nuclear submarine and is briefed by General Ashdown (Ironside) that the Resistance has discovered a hidden signal containing a code protocol which they believe can initiate a permanent shutdown of Skynet's machines. Working on this intelligence, the human militia plans to launch an offensive against the <b>Skynet</b> base in San Francisco. It is decided among the Resistance that the offensive will commence in four days, due to an intercepted kill-list created by <b>Skynet,</b> which plans to terminate the Resistance's command staff within the same time frame. John learns he is second on this list, following Kyle Reese (Yelchin). The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle's importance, but John knows Kyle will eventually travel {{back in time and}} become his father, and realizes that <b>Skynet</b> has learned of this fact.|$|E
5|$|Jadagrace Berry as Star, an 8-year-old girl in Kyle's care. Born after Judgment Day, Star is mute due to {{the trauma}} of the post-apocalyptic world. Therefore, this has given her the unnatural ability to sense when a <b>Skynet</b> unit is approaching.|$|E
5|$|Marcus tears out the {{hardware}} linking him to <b>Skynet</b> and assists John in battling the new T-800 (Model 101) Terminator (Kickinger). Marcus is soon outclassed in strength and temporarily disabled until John {{comes to his}} aid. Marcus eventually defeats the T-800, while John destroys the <b>Skynet</b> base by rigging together explosives. John, Marcus, Kyle, and Star are airlifted out. John though was seriously wounded during the assault with a life-threatening injury to his heart. Marcus offers his own heart for transplantation, sacrificing himself to save John. As he recovers, John radios to other Resistance fighters that, although this battle has been won, the war is still not over.|$|E
5|$|As {{a sequel}} to , T2 3-D: Battle Across Time {{introduced}} two new Terminator characters. The first is the Cyberdyne's latest invention, the T-1000000. It is a large spider-like version of the T-1000 that defends <b>Skynet's</b> CPU from attack. Like the T-1000, it is made of mimetic polyalloy, allowing it to form its legs into stabbing weapons. The only known T-1000000 was destroyed when <b>Skynet's</b> core was destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|Courtney B. Vance as Miles Dyson, Cyberdyne Systems' CEO, who, in the {{original}} timeline, was one of <b>Skynet's</b> creators; he funds his company's Genisys project.|$|R

5|$|The film {{features}} the first aquatic <b>Skynet</b> robot, the Hydrobot, which Laing modeled on eels, and {{was built by}} the animatronics crew with its exterior made of metal-looking rubber {{so it could be}} used in the aquatic scenes.|$|E
5|$|In 2018, John Connor (Bale) leads {{an attack}} on a <b>Skynet</b> base, where he discovers human prisoners and {{schematics}} for a new type of Terminator, incorporating living tissue, the T-800. John survives a violent assault on the base, which is destroyed. Following John's departure, Marcus emerges from the base's wreckage and begins walking towards Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} ending {{was to have}} John killed, and {{his image}} kept alive by the resistance by grafting his skin onto Marcus' cybernetic body. Marcus would have then murdered Kate, Barnes, Kyle, and Star. However, after the ending was leaked on the Internet, Warner Bros. decided to completely change the entire third act of the film. McG and Nolan did continue the Christ element of John's character though, {{in which he has}} some followers who believe what he knows about <b>Skynet</b> and others who do not.|$|E

5|$|The Terminator and the T-1000 {{converge}} on John {{in a shopping}} mall, and a chase ensues after which John and the Terminator escape together on a motorcycle. Fearing that the T-1000 will kill Sarah {{in order to get}} to him, John orders the Terminator to help free her. They encounter Sarah as she is escaping from the hospital, although she is initially reluctant to trust the T-800. After the trio escapes from the T-1000 in a police car, the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet's history. In addition, it would create machines that will hunt and kill the remnants of humanity. Sarah learns that the man most directly responsible for Skynet's creation is Miles Bennett Dyson, a Cyberdyne Systems engineer working on a revolutionary new neural net processor that will form the basis for <b>Skynet.</b>|$|E
5|$|The film used Technicolor's Oz process during post-production. This is {{a partial}} silver {{retention}} on the interpositive, similar to bleach bypass, {{which will be}} used to lend to the sense of detachment from the modern world McG was looking for. Industrial Light & Magic developed shader programs to make the desaturated lighting of the CGI realistic and well-integrated to the on-set footage. The filmmakers consulted with many scientists about the effects of an abandoned world and nuclear winter. McG cited , the original Star Wars trilogy and Children of Men, as well as the novel The Road, as his visual influences. He instructed his cast to read the latter as well as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Like Children of Men, McG would storyboard scenes so that it would be edited together to resemble a seamless, continuous shot. It took two weeks to film a two-minute shot of Connor getting caught up in a bombing on the <b>Skynet</b> base where he discovers plans for the T-800.|$|E

Just before she kills them, the T-850 arrives in a helicopter and crashes into the T-X. The T-X, with her endoskeleton broken in half and revealed, crawls and pursues John. But the T-850 grabs her and puts a hydrogen fuel cell in her mouth, destroying both the T-X and the T-850. Though it failed to kill John and Kate, the T-X succeeded in ensuring <b>Skynet's</b> rise.|$|R
5|$|Arriving at {{the ruins}} of Los Angeles, Marcus {{encounters}} Kyle and a mute child named Star (Berry) during a violent skirmish with Skynet's machines. Kyle and Star are subsequently abducted and taken prisoner by <b>Skynet.</b> Later, two Resistance A-10 airplanes are shot down while trying to intercept a machine transport. Wright locates downed pilot Blair Williams (Bloodgood). They then {{make their way to}} John's base, where thereafter, Marcus is wounded by a magnetic land mine. Attempting to save his life, the Resistance fighters discover that Marcus is indeed a cyborg, with a mechanical endoskeleton and a partially artificial cerebral cortex. Although Marcus believes himself to be human, John and his wife Kate think that Marcus has been sent to execute him and orders him to be killed. Blair helps Marcus escape. During the pursuit, Marcus saves John's life from Skynet's hydrobots and the two make a bargain; Marcus will enter Skynet's headquarters in San Francisco, to help John rescue Kyle and the other prisoners, if he lets him live.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, 2016 (August 29, 1997, {{being the}} date when <b>Skynet</b> becomes self-aware in the films), it was {{announced}} that the film would be digitally remastered in 3D to commemorate its 25th anniversary, with a worldwide re-release planned for summer 2017. The version to be remastered and rereleased in 3D was the original 137 minute theatrical cut, as the extended edition is not James Cameron's preferred version. Only one camera shot from the opening chase sequence was digitally altered to fix a minor continuity error which had bugged Cameron since the 1991 release. DMG Entertainment and Studiocanal worked together with Cameron to convert the film using the StereoD technology. The 3D version premiered on February 17, 2017, at the Berlin International Film Festival, with the theatrical re-release being scheduled for August 25, 2017. Similar to Cameron's Titanic 3D, Lightstorm Entertainment oversaw the work on the 3D version of Terminator 2, which took nearly a year to finish. The film was released by Distrib Films US which typically handles the release of French films. The studio released the film exclusively for one week in AMC Theatres nationwide, and said that it will expand depending on the film's performances in its first week.|$|E

25|$|Dark Horse Comics {{acquired}} the rights in 1990 and published The Terminator (titled Tempest in trade paperbacks to distinguish itself), {{where a group}} of human soldiers and four Terminators come to the present, to respectively kill or protect the developers of <b>Skynet.</b> One of the Terminators is Dudley, a human doctor with cybernetic implants, and he betrays his group as he feels he {{can make a difference in}} the past. In the following year's sequel Secondary Objectives, the surviving Terminator leader, C890.L, is reprogrammed to destroy another Terminator sent to aid him and kill Sarah Connor. In the immediate follow-up The Enemy Within, C890.L rebuilds and modifies himself to become more dangerous than ever, while a team of human assassins attempt to return to the past and kill a <b>Skynet</b> developer. The 1992 Endgame concludes this arc, with human colonel Mary Randall, having lost Dudley and her soldiers in the final battle with C890.L, protecting Sarah Connor as she goes into labor. Sarah gives birth to a girl named Jane, whose future leadership means <b>Skynet</b> is quickly defeated and never develops time travel.|$|E
