5|$|The {{narrative}} {{elements of}} the ceiling illustrate that God made the World as a perfect creation and put humanity into it, that humanity fell into disgrace and was punished by death and by separation from God. Humanity then sank further into sin and disgrace, and was punished by the Great Flood. Through a lineage of Ancestors – from Abraham to Joseph – God sent the saviour of humanity, Christ Jesus. The coming of the Saviour was prophesied by Prophets of Israel and Sibyls of the Classical world. The various components of the ceiling are linked to this Christian doctrine. Traditionally, the Old Testament was perceived as a prefiguring of the New Testament. Many incidents and characters of the Old Testament were commonly understood as having a direct <b>symbolic</b> <b>link</b> to some particular aspect {{of the life of}} Jesus or to an important element of Christian doctrine or to a sacrament such as Baptism or the Eucharist. Jonah, for example, was readily recognisable by his attribute of the large fish and was commonly seen to symbolise Jesus' death and resurrection.|$|E

25|$|Support of UNIX-style {{symbolic}} links. Previous Windows versions had {{support for}} a type of cross-volume reparse points known as junction points and hard links. However, junction points could be created only for directories and stored absolute paths, whereas hardlinks could be created for files but were not cross-volume. NTFS symbolic links can be created for any object and are cross-volume, cross-host (work over UNC paths), and store relative paths. However, the cross-host functionality of symbolic links does not work over the network with previous versions of Windows or other operating systems, only with computers running Windows Vista or a later Windows operating system. Symbolic links can be created, modified and deleted using the Mklink utility which is included with Windows Vista. Microsoft has published some developer documentation on symbolic links in the MSDN documentation. In addition, Windows Explorer is now symbolic link-aware and deleting a <b>symbolic</b> <b>link</b> from Explorer just deletes the link itself and not the target object. Explorer also shows the <b>symbolic</b> <b>link</b> target in the object's properties and shows a shortcut icon overlay on a junction point.|$|E

25|$|A {{file system}} can present a file of a {{particular}} type as a volume in its own right, similar to a loop device. The OS refers to this functionality as an image filing system. This allows transparent handling of archives and similar files, which appear as directories with some special properties. Files inside the image file appear in the hierarchy underneath the parent archive. It is not necessary for the archive to contain the data it refers to: some <b>symbolic</b> <b>link</b> and network share filesystems put a reference inside the image file and go elsewhere for the data.|$|E
25|$|The Galata Bridge was a <b>symbolic</b> <b>link</b> {{between the}} {{traditional}} city of Istanbul proper, {{site of the}} imperial palace and principal religious and secular institutions of the empire, and the districts of Galata, Beyoğlu, Şişli and Harbiye, where {{a large proportion of}} the inhabitants were non-Muslims and where foreign merchants and diplomats lived and worked. As Peyami Safa wrote in his novel, Fatih-Harbiye, a person who went from Fatih to Harbiye via the bridge set foot in a different civilization and a different culture. Apart from its place in fiction, the romantic appearance of the Galata Bridge made it the subject of many paintings and engravings.|$|E

Perhaps this {{particular}} formation represents a council of some sort—the fifteen other figurines {{seem to be}} listening to the red granite one, with the celts forming a backdrop.

There appears to be a definite <b>symbolic</b> <b>link</b> here, but it is unclear whether it is tied to the Olmec rudimentary writing system. To the red granite figurine's right, there seems be a line of three figurines filing past him. Another researcher has suggested that the granite figure is an initiate.|$|E

25|$|During {{the thirteenth}} and fourteenth centuries, with its {{activities}} underwritten by episcopal and papal indulgences, the hospital's {{role as a}} centre for alms collection persisted, but its linkage to the Order of Bethlehem increasingly unravelled, putting its purpose and patronage in doubt. In 1346 the master of Bethlem, a position at that time granted to the most senior of London's Bethlemite brethren, applied to the city authorities seeking protection; thereafter metropolitan office-holders claimed power to oversee the appointment of masters and demanded in return an annual payment of 40 shillings. It is doubtful whether the city really provided substantial protection and much less that the mastership fell within their patronage but, dating from the 1346 petition, it {{played a role in}} the management of Bethlem's finances. By this time the Bethlehemite bishops had relocated to Clamecy, France, under the surety of the Avignon papacy. This was significant as, throughout the reign of Edward III (1327–77), the English monarchy had extended its patronage over ecclesiastical positions through the seizure of priories under the control of non-English religious houses. As a dependent house of the Order of Saint Bethlehem in Clamecy, Bethlem was vulnerable to seizure by the crown and this occurred in the 1370s when Edward III took control. The purpose of this appropriation was, in the context of the Hundred Years' War between France and England, to prevent funds raised by the hospital from enriching the French monarchy via the papal court. After this event the masters of the hospital, semi-autonomous figures in charge of its day-to-day management, were normally crown appointees and it became an increasingly secularised institution. The memory of its foundation became muddied and muddled; in 1381 the royal candidate for the post of master claimed that from its beginnings it had been superintended by an order of knights and he confused its founder, Goffredo de Prefetti, with the Frankish crusader, Godfrey de Bouillon. The removal of the last <b>symbolic</b> <b>link</b> to the Bethlehemites was confirmed in 1403 when it was reported that master and inmates no longer wore the star of Bethlehem.|$|E
500|$|The IANA {{time zone}} {{database}} maps {{a name to}} the named location's historical and predicted clock shifts. This database is used by many computer software systems, including most Unix-like operating systems, Java, and the Oracle RDBMS; HP's [...] "tztab" [...] database is similar but incompatible. When temporal authorities change DST rules, zoneinfo updates are installed as part of ordinary system maintenance. In Unix-like systems the TZ environment variable specifies the location name, as in TZ=':America/New_York'. In many of those systems {{there is also a}} system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is not set: this setting is controlled by the contents of the /etc/localtime file, which is usually a <b>symbolic</b> <b>link</b> or hard link to one of the zoneinfo files. Internal time is stored in timezone-independent epoch time; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display.|$|E

500|$|Between 1703 and 1705, Leibniz {{corresponded with}} Jakob after {{learning}} about his discoveries in probability {{from his brother}} Johann. Leibniz managed to provide thoughtful criticisms on Bernoulli's law of large number, but failed to provide Bernoulli with de Witt's work on annuities that he so desired. From the outset, Bernoulli wished for his work to demonstrate that combinatorics and probability theory would have numerous real-world applications in all facets of society—in the line of Graunt's and de Witt's work— and {{would serve as a}} rigorous method of logical reasoning under insufficient evidence, as used in courtrooms and in moral judgements. It was also hoped that the theory of probability could provide comprehensive and consistent method of reasoning, where ordinary reasoning might be overwhelmed by the complexity of the situation. Thus the title Ars Conjectandi was chosen: [...] a link to the concept of ars inveniendi from scholasticism, which provided the <b>symbolic</b> <b>link</b> to pragmatism he desired and also {{as an extension of the}} prior Ars Cogitandi.|$|E
500|$|The term Avatar (also spelled Avatara) {{originates}} in Hindu mythology, where it most commonly {{refers to the}} incarnation (bodily manifestation) of a higher being or the Supreme Being on Earth. Carnivàles story never clearly establishes {{the meaning of this}} term, yet HBO and the writers used the term interchangeably with the Creatures of Light and Darkness of the series' opening monologue. The series portrays Avatars as human-like beings with supernatural powers who embody good and evil, and whose constant and age-long struggle serves to explain the Dark Ages and Ages of Enlightenment in humanity's history in the real world. Carnivàle represents this Avataric duality as Light and Dark in several instances. The surnames of the main characters, Ben Hawkins and Justin Crowe, suggest a <b>symbolic</b> <b>link</b> to hawks and crows, the winged Creatures of Light and Dark. The last two Tarot cards seen in the Carnivàles opening title sequence are [...] "The Sun" [...] and [...] "The Moon", standing for God and the Devil.

40|$|Formal {{verification}} enables {{developers to}} provide {{safety and security}} guarantees about their code. A modular verification approach supports the verification of different pieces of an application in separation. We propose <b>symbolic</b> <b>linking</b> as such a modular approach, since it allows {{to decide whether or}} not earlier verified source files can be safely linked together (i. e. earlier proven properties remain valid). If an annotation-based verifier for C source code supports both <b>symbolic</b> <b>linking</b> and preprocessing, care must be taken that <b>symbolic</b> <b>linking</b> does not become unsound. The problem is that the result of a header expansion depends upon the defined macros right before expansion. In this paper, we describe how <b>symbolic</b> <b>linking</b> affects the type checking process and why the interaction with preprocessing results in an unsoundness. Moreover, we define a preprocessing technique which ensures soundness by construction and show that the resulting semantics after type checking are equivalent to the standard C semantics. We implemented this preprocessing technique in VeriFast, an annotation-based verifier for C source code that supports <b>symbolic</b> <b>linking,</b> and initial experiments indicate that the modified preprocessor allows most common use cases. To the extent of our knowledge, we are the first to support both modular and sound verification of annotated C source code. status: publishe...|$|R
