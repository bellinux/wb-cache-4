50|$|Like all citrus fruit, {{mandarins}} hybridize readily {{with other}} citrus. Many fruit sold as mandarins {{are in fact}} hybrids with some pummelo (C. maxima) ancestry, and are thus on a continuum with clementines, sweet and <b>sour</b> <b>oranges,</b> and grapefruit.|$|R
25|$|Recorded history {{began when}} the United States Life Saving Service built the Orange Grove House of Refuge in 1876.

25|$|Trees from groves in hammocks or areas {{covered with}} pine forest are budded on <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> trees, {{a method that}} gives a high solids content. On sand, they are grafted on rough lemon rootstock. The Hamlin orange {{is one of the}} most popular juice oranges in Florida and replaces the Parson Brown variety as the {{principal}} early-season juice orange. This cultivar is now the leading early orange in Florida and, possibly, in the rest of the world.|$|E
25|$|The 'Jaffa' orange {{was a new}} variety {{developed}} by Palestinian farmers after emerging in the mid-19th century as a mutation on a tree of the 'Baladi' variety {{near the city of}} Jaffa. While the <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> (C. aurantium) was brought westward from China and India by Arab traders, who probably introduced it to Sicily and Spain, the 'Jaffa' orange was developed from the sweet orange (C. sinensis) which was brought from China to the Mediterranean region by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in 1498.|$|E
50|$|In France, {{the first}} orangerie was built and stocked by Charles VIII of France at the Château of Amboise. There is general {{agreement}} that {{the arrival of the}} sweet orange in Europe was linked with the activities of the Portuguese during the fifteenth century, and particularly by Vasco de Gama's voyages to the East. Although the Romans had been acquainted with lemons and probably <b>sour</b> <b>oranges</b> as well as citrons, the different types - <b>sour</b> <b>oranges,</b> lemons and sweet oranges - reached Europe centuries apart. By withholding water and nutrients, and by using pruning techniques, French gardeners were able to make citrus trees bloom throughout the year, to the delight of Louis XIV. Citrus motifs formed themes in sculpture, mosaics, embroidery, weaving, paintings, poems, and songs throughout history, and orange blossoms remain prized as floral ornaments at weddings.|$|R

In 1926, the grove produced about 40,000 boxes of oranges.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{following}} time, the Greek citron of Jaffa pushed the Balady citron off the market. The Jaffa Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook founded and headed the [...] "Atzei Hadar" [...] union for kosher etrog cultivators and marketers, to prevent grafting the Jaffa etrog unto rootstock of <b>sour</b> <b>orange</b> or sweet lime, but very much promoted intraspecific grafting of the Greek citron upon Balady citron rootstock, which is permitted by Halacha.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first such}} known chimera was {{probably}} the Bizzaria which is a fusion of the Florentine citron and the <b>sour</b> <b>orange.</b> Well-known examples of a graft-chimera are Laburnocytisus 'Adamii', caused by a fusion of a Laburnum and a broom, and [...] "Family" [...] trees, where multiple varieties of apple or pear are grafted onto the same tree.

40|$|Self-in{{compatibility}} and compatibility of 65 citrus accessions {{were determined}} by pollen tube growth in the style.

Furthermore, among <b>sour</b> <b>oranges</b> and their relatives, two out of six accessions were, likewise, self-incompatible as were {{one out of five}} sweet orange and their relatives. Every yuzu and its relatives, except hyuga-natsu, were self-compatible. Of the mandarin and its relatives, 14 out of 28 accessions were self-incompatible, whereas calamondin, a kumquat relative, and Hedzuka daidai of diverse origin were self-compatible. Thirty-one out of 65 accessions used in this study were self-incompatible. Of the self-incompatible accessions, clementine and ‘Ariake’, a hybrid of navel orange and clementine, were cross-incompatible. Thus, the incompatible genotypes of those two accessions were considered to be identical.

Suchitlán is known for its traditional dances, such as “morenos,” “gallitas,” “negros,” “sonjaeros” and “del rebozo.” Zacualpan’s noted dance is the Danza de Conquista. Suchitlán has an annual carnival, celebrated with foods and drink such as nijayote, pinole and <b>sour</b> <b>oranges.</b> The opening ceremony features people with crowns and scepters made of bread, flowers and necklaces who give solemn and emotional speeches. One special guest treated this was Rigoberta Menchú. During festivals in Comala, it is traditional for women to dress up in costumes meant to imitate indigenous dress, and form a procession to announce rodeos called jaripeos as well as an event called Día de los Hijos Ausentes. During the festival of La Caja, dancing horses create a show accompanied by music. In various locations in the municipality, Independence Day is celebrated with horse and foot races by people of all ages. During the Feast of Saint John in Zacualpan, the winners receive prizes such as pigs, hens and turkeys.|$|R

Dessa forma, o uso de variedades resistentes e/ou tolerantes desponta como a alternativa mais eficiente, razão pela qual se julgou oportuna a realização deste trabalho. O presente estudo teve como objetivo avaliar o comportamento de variedades e clones de laranjas introduzidas em relação a X. fastidiosa. Foram estudados 59 variedades e clones de laranjas doces e 2 de laranjas azedas introduzidos da França, Itália e Portugal. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi o de blocos casualizados (DBC), com 62 tratamentos e 4 repetições, incluindo a variedade 'Pêra', como padrão. Cada parcela continha duas plantas, sendo uma inoculada e a outra sem inoculação. Para a inoculação do patógeno, foi empregado o método de encostia, utilizando-se de mudas infectadas. Para a avaliação da incidência da doença, utilizou-se de dados qualitativos, positivos ou negativos, enquanto para severidade empregou-se escala de notas, que foi estabelecida baseando-se nos sintomas de CVC, confirmados através dos testes de PCR. As variedades de laranjas azedas Beja e Sr. Pinto e as laranjas doces Navelina ISA 315, Navelina SRA 332 e Newhall Navel SRA 343 não apresentaram sintomas em folhas até 27 meses após a inoculação.

The Woodland Shade Garden offers picturesque views over a chain of lakes, the White Garden boasts three magnificent white pergolas surrounding a lawn and the Formal Garden features four parterres surrounded by olive and white crapemyrtles. The Georgia Trustees Garden replica -- the agricultural plot began by James Oglethorpe and existed from 1733 to 1755 -- also was laid out and features edible, medicinal and crop commodities the first settlers to the Georgia colony were expected to produce.
