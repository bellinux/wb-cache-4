5|$|Nitrogen is {{commonly}} used during <b>sample</b> <b>preparation</b> in chemical analysis. It is used to concentrate and reduce the volume of liquid samples.

5|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has good}} spatial resolution (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal <b>sample</b> <b>preparation</b> and is rather informative. Consequently, Raman spectroscopy {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which have one of the bandgaps equal to the exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E

25|$|It is {{challenging}} to identify rare variants accurately using standard NGS methods with the mutations rate of (10−2 - 10−3).

An example of such errors is C>A/G>T transversion that is detected in low frequencies using deep sequencing or targeted capture data and arise {{as the result of}} DNA oxidation during <b>sample</b> <b>preparation.</b> These types of false positive variants are filter out by duplex sequencing method since mutations need to be accurately matched in both strands of DNA to be validated as true mutations.

25|$|An {{effective}} <b>sample</b> <b>preparation</b> protocol, usually involving either {{liquid-liquid extraction}} (LLE) or solid phase extraction (SPE) and frequently derivatisation can remove ion suppressing species {{from the sample}} matrix prior to analysis.

25|$|One <b>sample</b> <b>preparation</b> {{issue with}} liquid chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} is possible matrix effects {{due to the}} presence of background molecules. These matrix effects have been shown to decrease the signal in methods such as PI and ESI by amounts as much as 60% depending on the sample being analyzed. The matrix effect can also cause an increase in signal, producing false positive results. This can be corrected by purifying the sample as much as possible before LC is performed, {{but in the case of}} analyzing environmental samples where everything in the sample is of concern, <b>sample</b> <b>preparation</b> may not be the ideal solution to fix the problem. Another method that can be applied to correct the issue is by using the standard addition method.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not always}} {{possible}} to eliminate ion suppression by <b>sample</b> <b>preparation</b> and/or chromatographic resolution.

25|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} (LC) is {{a method}} {{that in some ways}} is more powerful than GC, but can be coupled to mass spectrometry just as easily. In LC, the concerns involving <b>sample</b> <b>preparation</b> can be minimal. In LC, both the stationary and mobile phase can affect the separation, whereas in GC only the stationary phase should be influential. This allows for the <b>sample</b> <b>preparation</b> to be minimal if one is willing to adjust the stationary phase or mobile phase before running the sample. The primary concern is the concentration of analyte. If the concentration is too high then separation can be unsuccessful, but mass spectrometry as a detection method does not need complete separation, showing another benefit of coupling LC to a mass spectrometer.|$|E

25|$|There {{are some}} ESI methods that require {{little to no}} <b>sample</b> <b>preparation.</b> One such method is a method termed {{extractive}} electrospray ionization (EESI). This method involves having an electrospray of solvent directed at an angle against a different spray of the sample solution, produced by a separate nebulizer. This method requires no <b>sample</b> <b>preparation</b> in that the electrospray of solvent extracts the sample from the complex mixture, effectively removing any background contaminants. Another particularly powerful variation on ESI is desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which involves directing an electrospray at a surface with the sample deposited on top of it. The sample is ionized in the electrospray as it splashes off the surface, then traveling to the mass spectrometer. This method is important {{because of the fact}} that no <b>sample</b> <b>preparation</b> is needed for this method. A sample simply needs to be deposited on a surface, such as paper. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) is similar to ESI in that the sample is nebulized in droplets that are then evaporated, leaving behind a charged ion to be analyzed. APCI experiences few of the negative matrix effects experienced by ESI due to the fact that ionization occurs in the gas phase in this method rather than the within the liquid droplets as in ESI and the fact that in APCI there is an overabundance of reaction gas, thus minimizing the effect of the matrix on the ionization process.|$|E

25|$|High {{error rate}} (0.01-0.001) of {{standard}} NGS platforms that introduced during <b>sample</b> <b>preparation</b> or sequencing {{is a major}} limitation for detection of variants present in small fraction of cells.
