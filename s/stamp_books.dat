Users accumulated flooz credits either as a promotional bonus given away by some internet businesses or purchased directly from flooz.com which then could be redeemed for merchandise at a variety of participating online stores. Adoption of flooz by both merchants and customers proved limited, and it never established itself as a widely recognized medium of exchange, which hindered both its usefulness and appeal.|$|E
50|$|Sperry & Hutchinson began {{offering}} stamps to U.S. retailers in 1896. The retail organizations that distributed the stamps were primarily supermarkets, gasoline filling stations, and stores. They bought the stamps from S&H {{and gave them}} as bonuses to shoppers based on the dollar amount of a purchase. The stamps were issued in denominations of one, ten, and fifty points, perforated with a gummed reverse. As shoppers accumulated the stamps, they moistened the reverse and mounted them in collector's books, which were provided free by S&H. The books contained 24 pages and filling a page required 50 points, so each book contained 1,200 points. Shoppers could then exchange filled books for premiums, including housewares and other items, from the local Green Stamps store or catalog. Each premium was assigned a value expressed {{by the number of}} filled <b>stamp</b> <b>books</b> required to obtain it.|$|E

50|$|Boom {{experienced}} {{her first}} job as both an editor and designer during her {{time at the}} Dutch Government Publishing and Printing Office. It was here that she was noticed by Ootje Oxenaar, a designer of Dutch banknotes, who invited her to design two catalogues for special edition postage stamps between years 1987-1988. To him, she was the ‘designer of the crazy ads’. The annual Dutch postage <b>stamp</b> <b>books</b> was considered a prestigious opportunity with previous designers had including Wim Crouwel, Karl Maartens and Gert Dumbar. Boom's experimental style was evident in this particular publication, through the rich layers of information and imagery. Boom structured the book in a Japanese style binding and had text crossing multiple pages with printed folds and translucent paper. Though well received by Oxenaar, this project drew a lot of public outcry for being overtly experimental in comparison to previous editions. Boom received much hate mail, particularly from stamp collectors. However, this controversy brought her name into the public stage and established her name as a designer.|$|E
50|$|Whatever their origins, {{confession}} albums were {{an established}} form by the 1860s: Henry d'Ideville records using an album in 1861 (see Germany and France below); Karl Marx filled out answers {{to one in}} the spring of 1865 (his favourite colour was red); and Friedrich Engels answered another in 1868 (his idea of happiness was Château Margaux 1848). Early albums often had blank pages into which owners would paste the questionnaires; the questions on these could be preprinted or handwritten. One such album with handwritten questions, was that of Karl Marx's daughter Jenny, which contains entries dated from 1865 to 1870. For some of these, she sent the questions to friends, asking them to fill them out and return them. Her comments in a letter of November 1865 suggest that she regarded the genre as a novelty:I have a whole book filled up in that way and the answers are very amusing when compared with one another. These Confession books have put albums and <b>stamp</b> <b>books</b> quite into the shade. … I should much like to have answers. It is more interesting and amusing than a mere Autograph.|$|E
40|$|Ms. Whisner {{describes}} the method {{and some of}} the results reported in a recently published book about the reference interview written by two library school professors. She points out that despite its academic approach, the book has much to offer the practicing reference librarian. ¶ 1 When I was in library school, I sometimes caught a whiff of defensiveness among the faculty. Some people in the outside world thought that library education must amount to little more than training students to <b>stamp</b> <b>books</b> and be fussy. And if these outsiders did not understand that regular librarians needed master’s degrees, then they certainly would not understand that the professors had Ph. D. s. Even within the academy, some faculty members from other fields might have occasionally suggested that library science was not much of a science (not even a social science). I am not saying that their defensiveness was not justified—the discipline does struggle for recognition. Indeed, many library students and librarians themselves roll their eyes and scoff at the idea of pursuing a doctorate. Who would want to write a dissertation about any of that stuff...|$|E
