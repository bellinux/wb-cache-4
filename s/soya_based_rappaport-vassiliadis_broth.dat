40|$|Detection of the {{specific}} Salmonella serovar Gallinarum, which is divided into the biovars Pullorum and Gallinarum, is compulsory under the national hygienic and sanitary control regulations of France for breeding flocks whose offspring are exported. Our aim {{was to examine the}} suitability of bacteriologic and serologic methods routinely used in France to screen serum samples and organs for S. Gallinarum. Since bacteriologic reference techniques are designed to isolate the commonly occurring non-typhoid serovars, such as S. Typhimurium, S. Enteritidis, and others that cause outbreaks of foodborne illness, they may not be particularly suitable for detecting S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum. This hypothesis was confirmed by the inoculation of 10 -wk-old chickens and 1 -d-old chicks with various strains of S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum. The most reliable enrichment media were selenite cystine and <b>Rappaport-Vassiliadis</b> <b>broths.</b> Moreover, on the usual plating media, colonies were small, grew more slowly than the common serovars (in 48 h instead of 24 h), and had an unusual appearance. Since the rapid slide agglutination (RSA) test is based only on antigens from standard and variant strains of S. Pullorum, it may not readily detect S. Gallinarum. In our study, it detected infection in all 10 -wk-old chickens inoculated with S. Pullorum strains but did not detect any antibodies against S. Gallinarum. Therefore, S.

Using the Mix-ELISA, 16 / 20 farms were positive with farm sample prevalence ranging from 28. 6 % to 100 %. In comparing the farms, there was a direct correlation between lymph node culture and MixELISA detection levels. These data suggest that the Mix-ELISA may be a valuable herd screening tool for the evaluation of Salmonella levels in U. S. swine herds.

Previous work has suggested that pigs may be getting infected, but little has been reported on the environmental contamination of abattoir holding pens. For 24 groups of pigs studied (∼ 150 animals/group) at two high-capacity abattoirs, six pooled fecal samples (n, 10 per pool) were collected from each transport trailer immediately after pigs were unloaded. Holding pens were sampled (one drinking water sample and six pooled floor samples consisting of swabs, residual liquid, and feces) prior to entry of study pigs for the routine holding period (∼ 2. 5 h). After slaughter, cecal contents and ileocecal lymph nodes were collected, on the processing line, from 30 pigs in each studied group. All samples were cultured for the isolation and identification of S. enterica by primary enrichment in GN-Hajna and tetrathionate broths, secondary enrichment in <b>Rappaport-Vassiliadis</b> <b>broth,</b> and plating on brilliant green sulfa and xylose-lysine-tergitol- 4 agars, followed by biochemical and serological identification. The study pens were highly contaminated with S. enterica; all holding pens sampled had at least one positive sample. Additionally, 33 % (8 of 24) of drinking water samples were positive for S. enterica. All 24 groups of pigs had S. enterica-positive cecal contents and ileocecal lymph nodes, including those groups from transport trailers with no positive samples. From pigs, trailers, and pens, 586 isolates representing 36 different Salmonella serovars were isolated. Of the 353 isolates from pigs (109 from ileocecal lymph nodes plus 244 from cecal contents), 19 % were identified as belonging to the same serovars as those isolated from the respective pens; 27 % were identified as belonging to the same serovars as those isolated from the trailers. Sixteen percent of the unique serovars were isolated from both pigs and pens, suggesting that pens served as the infection source.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The first objective of this investigation was to identify a practical and efficient sampling and culture procedure for recovering Salmonella and Campylobacter from commercially processed turkey carcasses. To investigate this objective, several carcass rinsing and bacteriologic culture procedures were compared to identify a method for completing the second objective of the investigation, which was to conduct a microbiological survey of commercial turkey processing. During this large-scale survey of six independent turkey processing facilities, the effects of management practices and chosen microbial intervention strategies during immersion chilling on Salmonella or Campylobacter recovery were investigated. In two experiments, several carcass rinsing and culture procedures were compared to identify a method that was accurate, sensitive, inexpensive and logistically feasible for Salmonella recovery from processed turkey carcasses. Briefly, this method consists of rinsing carcasses in 200 mL of buffered peptone water (BPW) in a large polyethylene bag, aseptic collection of rinse fluid into sterile polypropylene culture bottles, pre-enrichment of recovered rinse fluid in additional BPW, selective enrichment in <b>Rappaport-Vassiliadis</b> <b>broth</b> (RV), and plating to double modified lysine iron agar (DMLIA) plates. Also, from the same sample of collected carcass rinse fluid, Campylobacter can be selectively cultured by direct enrichment in Bolton's complete enrichment medium followed by plating to Campy-cefex agar plating medium. This method of recovering Salmonella or Campylobacter was used to complete research directed at objective 2. Following a microbiological survey of commercial turkey processing, observed data led to the following conclusions. Our data indicate that most commercial turkey processing facilities apply effective management during immersion chilling to reduce the presence of foodborne pathogens on commercially processed turkeys. Importantly, assessment of chiller management within each plant was predictive of recorded microbiologic data. Obtained data indicated that facilities implementing the most stringent immersion chilling management practices were associated with the most effective Salmonella or Campylobacter remediation on processed carcasses. Further, if assessments of management reflected poor practices or oversight, microbiologic data were similarly reflective of such trends. Data from this investigation suggest that properly managed immersion chilling systems are capable of reducing the incidence of Salmonella or Campylobacter on post-chill processed poultry carcasses...|$|R
40|$|Issues of {{wastewater}} sludge disposal confront communities {{throughout the}} world. One {{of the most}} economically and environmentally feasible options for sludge disposal is re-use as an agricultural and horticultural soil amendment. However, re-use of sludge poses a potential risk to public health due to the possibilities for pathogen transmission. Several countries have developed regulations designed to limit potential health risks and Australia {{is in the process}} of formulating its own sludge management guidelines. One pathogen of concern in wastewater sludge is Salmonella. Sludge management guidelines specify acceptable levels of Salmonella in sludge destined for re-use. However, no standard method exists for detection of Salmonella in wastewater sludge. This project aimed to determine appropriate methods for detecting the presence or absence of Salmonella in Australian sludges. Four experiments were conducted. The first of these was designed to determine the most suitable culture media for analysis of raw, digested, dewatered and composted sludge and was based on a comparison of media recommended in the USA and in Australia. <b>Rappaport-Vassiliadis</b> <b>broth</b> (RV) and xylose lysine deoxycholate agar (XLD) were found to be the most efficient media for isolating Salmonella from raw and digested sludge. Dulcitol selenite enrichment (DSE) was the most efficient enrichment for composted sludge, and XLD was again determined to be the most efficient plating medium. Optimal media could not be determined for dewatered sludge. The second experiment assessed the need for pre-enrichment of raw sludge samples. Pre-enrichment did not improve Salmonella detection. The third experiment determined the influence of the amount of sludge analysed on detection of Salmonella. A greater number of positive samples was detected when a 50 g sample was analysed as five 10 g subsamples than when it was not divided into subsamples, although the difference was not statistically significant. The final experiment evaluated the applicability of a commercial ELISA kit to use with sludge. The sensitivity of the assay was such that it was deemed unsuitable for monitoring the presence of Salmonella in sludge on a routine basis. The final recommended protocol for detection of Salmonella in wastewater sludge was as follows: 1) pre-enrichment of samples, 2) enrichment for 48 h in RV and DSE for raw and digested sludge or tetrathionate broth, DSE and strontium chloride B broth for composted sludge, 3) subculture on XLD and bismuth sulphite agar after 24 and 48 h enrichment. This method was not completely satisfactory and this project highlighted the need for improvement of culture methods as well as development of alternative procedures...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have revealed}} that dynamical thickening is dominant in the growth process of sea ice in the southern Sea of Okhotsk. That indicates the importance of understanding the nature of thick deformed ice in this area. The objective of the present paper {{is to establish a}} ship-based method for observing the thickness of deformed ice with reasonable accuracy. Since February 2003, one of the authors has engaged in the core sampling using a small basket from the icebreaker <b>Soya.</b> <b>Based</b> on these results, we developed a new model which expressed the internal structure of pack ice in the southern Sea of Okhotsk, as a one-dimensional multilayered structure. Since 2004, the electromagnetic (EM) inductive sounding of sea-ice thickness has been conducted on board Soya. By combining the model and theoretical calculations, a new algorithm was developed for transforming the output of the EM inductive instrument to ice + snow thickness (total thickness). Comparison with total thickness by drillhole observations showed fair agreement. The probability density functions of total thickness in 2004 and 2005 showed some difference, which reflected the difference of fractions of thick deformed ice...|$|R
