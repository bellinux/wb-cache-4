500|$|Many {{of those}} {{familiar}} with the subculture she described, including her own friends, disagreed with her portrayal of it; Romaine Brooks called her [...] "a digger-up of worms with the pretension of a distinguished archaeologist". Hall's correspondence shows that the negative view of bars like Alec's that she expressed in The Well was sincerely meant, but <b>she</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> that such bars did not represent the only homosexual communities in Paris. It is a commonplace of criticism that her own experience of lesbian life was not as miserable as Stephen's. By focusing on misery and describing its cause as [...] "ceaseless persecution" [...] by [...] "the so-called just and righteous", she intensified the urgency of her plea for change.|$|E
2500|$|Due to Woolf's work in {{polishing}} translations, she {{was able}} to see the differences between Russian and British authors. Yet <b>she</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> that [...] "from the comparison of two fictions so immeasurably far apart are futile save indeed as they flood us with a view of infinite possibilities of the art". Woolf's main purpose in comparing the two culturally different writers was to show the possibilities that modern fiction would be able to take in the future.|$|E

The solution to both problems lay in war.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{those with}} whom Clarissa danced at that year's Liberal Ball was the future double agent Donald Maclean, who complained that she was too smart to be [...] "a proper Liberal girl like the Bonham-Carters or the Asquiths". <b>She</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> Guy Burgess, who fled to Russia in 1951 when he and Maclean {{were about to be}} unmasked as traitors. A 2015 {{biography}} of Burgess, a homosexual, contained claims that, encouraged by his Soviet [...] "handlers", he had contemplated marriage to Clarissa. However, the latter, then aged 95, denied that they had been close. She described Burgess as [...] "courteous, amusing, nice and good company", but said that he had been [...] "standoffish" [...] towards her and did not wish any friendship to develop.|$|E
2500|$|As police {{descended on}} the neighborhood, a local woman walked up to MacArthur Boulevard {{to see what the}} commotion was about.

Although she knew her life would be in danger if she were labeled a [...] "snitch", the woman decided to give this information to an officer she recognized. The information was then relayed to Lieutenant Christopher Mufarreh, who was investigating Mixon's possible whereabouts independently, by an off-duty police lieutenant. Without consultation or coordination with his superiors, Mufarreh ordered a SWAT team to converge on the scene.|$|E
2500|$|By May 1971, most of Genie's {{vocabulary}} {{consisted of}} words for colors, the numbers 1 through 5, the word [...] "mama" [...] {{and a few}} peoples' names, the verbs [...] "stop it" [...] and [...] "spit", {{and a large number}} of miscellaneous nouns". <b>She</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> a few compound verbs, such as put back, although she treated them as single words in her vocabulary, and learned few stative verbs within the typical time frame of language acquisition. Whereas children's vocabulary primarily consists of nouns and a few particles, Genie's early lexicon contained almost as many adjectives and verbs as nouns, and unlike most children she used entire phrases as labels, only doing so with single words if asked. Before she began forming two-word sentences she could both ask for something and associate an object with someone, which was normal, but unlike most children she could also ask about memories or future events which had previously been mentioned. In late May 1971 with Jean Butler, her teacher at the hospital, Genie showed comprehension of basic commands.|$|E
