40|$|Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) is an {{enabling}} technology for NASA s Distributed Air-Ground Traffic Management (DAG-TM) concept. DAG-TM has {{the goal of}} significantly increasing capacity within the National Airspace System, while maintaining or improving safety. Under DAG-TM, aircraft exchange state and intent information over ADS-B with other aircraft and ground stations. This information supports various surveillance functions including conflict detection and resolution, scheduling, and conformance monitoring. To conduct more rigorous concept feasibility studies, NASA Langley Research Center s PC-based Air Traffic Operations Simulation models a 1090 MHz ADS-B communication structure, based on industry standards for message content, range, and reception probability. The current ADS-B model reflects a mature operating environment and message interference effects are limited to Mode S transponder replies and ADS-B <b>squitters.</b> This model was recently evaluated in a Joint DAG-TM Air/Ground Coordination Experiment with NASA Ames Research Center. Message probability of reception vs. range was lower at higher traffic levels. The highest message collision probability occurred near the meter fix serving as the confluence for two arrival streams. Even the highest traffic level encountered in the experiment was significantly less than the industry standard "LA Basin 2020 " scenario. Future studies will account for Mode A and C message interference (a major effect in several industry studies) and will include Mode A and C aircraft in the simulation, thereby increasing the total traffic level. These changes will support ongoing enhancements to separation assurance functions that focus on accommodating longer ADS-B information update intervals...|$|R
40|$|A typical ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast) ground {{receiver}} {{is equipped}} with an omnidirectional antenna to receives the messages transmitted by the ADS-B equipped aircraft. The aircraft transmit unsolicited ADS-B messages periodically, on the 1090 MHz downlink channel. There are other ATC systems using the same frequency (Secondary Surveillance Radar SSR, Traffic Information System – Broadcast TIS-B), then, considering that the ADS-B receiving stations use omnidirectional antenna {{or in some cases}} a six sector antenna, the probability of interference grows with the air traffic increase. Therefore there is a risk of data loss due to “garbled” ADS-B OUT 1090 ES messages in the receiving station, with a reduction of the valid data rate. In this paper an ADS-B ground receiver with signals discrimination capability is proposed. Such device is able to detect and solve signals overlapping events. This feature is useful to improve the 1090 extended <b>squitters</b> receiving capacity for a ground receiver station. The proposed receiver is composed by the antenna system, an analog-digital front-end and a pre-processing unit followed by a RTCA-DO 260 compliant 1090 MHz decoder. The pre-processing unit implements the signal discrimination and separation procedures. These procedures are based on processing algorithms studied and developed by Tor Vergata University RadarLab. This unit differs depending if the antenna is single element or an array, for which case the underlying algorithm has better performances. The algorithms are introduced, and their analyses allow to evaluate the resulting channel capacity {{as a function of the}} environmental messages density...|$|R

He was Kentish and English, and that meant hops, beer, dog-rose's, and the sort of {{sunshine}} that was best in the world.

These earlier chapters have given an idea of what happened to Bun Hill, and how the flood of novel things had poured over its devoted rusticity. Bert Smallways was only one of countless millions in Europe and America and Asia who, instead of being born rooted in the soil, were born struggling in a torrent they never clearly understood. All the faiths of their fathers had been taken by surprise, and startled into the strangest forms and reactions. Particularly did the fine old tradition of patriotism get perverted and distorted in the rush of the new times. Instead of the sturdy establishment in prejudice of Bert's grandfather, to whom the word [...] "Frenchified" [...] was the ultimate term of contempt, there flowed through Bert's brain a <b>squittering</b> succession of thinly violent ideas about German competition, about the Yellow Danger, about the Black Peril, about the White Man's Burthen--that is to say, Bert's preposterous right to muddle further the naturally very muddled politics of the entirely similar little cads to himself (except for a smear of brown) who smoked cigarettes and rode bicycles in Buluwayo, Kingston (Jamaica), or Bombay.

40|$|Low-visibility Landing and Surface Operations System (LVLASO) is {{currently}} being prototyped and tested at NASA Langley Research Center. Since the main objective {{of the system is}} to maintain the aircraft landings and take-offs even during low-visibility conditions, timely exchange of positional and other information between the aircraft and the ground control is critical. For safety and reliability reasons, there are several redundant sources on the ground (e. g., ASDE, AMASS) that collect and disseminate information about the environment to the aircrafts. The data link subsystem of LVLASO is responsible for supporting the timely transfer of information between the aircrafts and the ground controllers. In fact, if not properly designed, the data link subsystem could become a bottleneck in the proper functioning of LVLASO. Currently, the other components of the system are being designed assuming that the data link has adequate capacity and is capable of delivering the information in a timely manner. During August 1 - 28, 1997, several flight experiments were conducted to test the prototypes of subsystems developed under LVLASO project, The back-round and details of the tests are described in the next section. The test results have been collected in two CDs by FAA and Rockwell-Collins. Under the current grant, we have analyzed the data and evaluated the performance of the Mode S datalink. In this report, we summarize the results of our analysis. Much of the results are shown in terms of graphs or histograms. The test date (or experiment number) was often taken as the X-axis and the Y-axis denotes whatever metric of focus in that chart. In interpreting these charts, one need {{to take into account the}} vehicular traffic during a particular experiment. In general, the performance of the data link was found to be quite satisfactory in terms of delivering long and short Mode S <b>squitters</b> from the vehicles to the ground receiver, Similarly, its performance in delivering control messages from the ground control to the vehicles (aircrafts) was also satisfactory.

50|$|In 2002 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{announced}} a dual link decision using the 1090 MHz extended <b>squitter</b> (1090 ES) link for air carrier and private or commercial operators of high-performance aircraft, and universal access transceiver link {{for the typical}} general aviation user. In November 2012, the European Aviation Safety Agency confirmed that the Europe Union would also use 1090 ES for interoperability. The format of extended <b>squitter</b> messages has been codified by the ICAO.|$|E
50|$|Two link {{solutions}} {{are used as}} the physical layer for relaying ADS-B position reports: universal access transceiver, and 1090 MHz extended <b>squitter.</b>|$|E
50|$|With 1090 ES, the {{existing}} Mode S transponder (TSO C-112 or a standalone 1090 MHz transmitter) supports a message type {{known as the}} extended <b>squitter</b> message. It is a periodic message that provides position, velocity, time, and, in the future, intent. The basic ES does not offer intent since current flight management systems do not provide such data (called trajectory change points). To enable an aircraft to send an extended <b>squitter</b> message, the transponder is modified (TSO C-166A) and aircraft position and other status information is routed to the transponder. ATC ground stations and aircraft equipped with {{traffic collision avoidance system}} (TCAS) already have the necessary 1090 MHz (Mode S) receivers to receive these signals, and would only require enhancements to accept and process the additional extended <b>squitter</b> information. As per the FAA ADS-B link decision, and the technical link standards, 1090 ES does not support FIS-B service.|$|E

(Pulse-pairs that are not coincident with the individual aircraft's interrogation pattern e.g. not synchronous, are referred to as filler pulse-pairs, or <b>squitter.</b> Also, replies to other aircraft that are therefore non-synchronous also appear as <b>squitter).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 2009, the ICAO defined an [...] "extended squitter" [...] mode of operation; it {{supplements}} {{the requirements}} contained in ICAO Annex 10, Volumes III and IV. The first edition specified {{earlier versions of}} extended <b>squitter</b> messages: ...|$|E

50|$|Primarily, <b>squitter</b> {{is used to}} {{maintain}} a regular signal from the ground beacon.

5000|$|In 2009 the ICAO {{published}} an [...] "extended" [...] form of Mode S with more message formats {{to use with}} ADS-B; it was further refined in 2012.

5000|$|Another mode called Mode S (Select) is {{designed}} to help avoiding overinterrogation of the transponder (having many radars in busy areas) and to allow automatic collision avoidance. Mode S transponders are compatible with Mode A and Mode C Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) systems. [...] This is the type of transponder that is used for TCAS or ACAS II (Airborne Collision Avoidance System) functions, and is required to implement the extended <b>squitter</b> broadcast, one means of participating in ADS-B systems. A TCAS-equipped aircraft must have a Mode S transponder, but not all Mode S transponders include TCAS. Likewise, a Mode S transponder is required to implement 1090ES extended <b>squitter</b> ADS-B Out, but {{there are other ways to}} implement ADS-B Out (in the U.S. and China.) The format of Mode S messages is documented in ICAO Doc 9688, Manual on Mode S Specific Services.|$|E
50|$|In the Mode S {{secondary}} {{surveillance radar}} system, 'squitter' is a term used to describe messages that are unsolicited downlink transmissions from an automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) Mode S transponder system. Mode S transponders transmit acquisition <b>squitter</b> (unsolicited downlink transmissions) to permit passive acquisition by interrogators with broad antenna beams, where active acquisition may be hindered by all-call synchronous garble. Examples of such interrogators are an {{airborne collision avoidance system}} and an airport surface system.|$|E

Operators will have two options for equipage under this rule—the 1090 megahertz extended <b>squitter</b> broadcast link or the universal access transceiver broadcast link.

40|$|III GPS-Squitter merges the {{capabilities}} ofAutomatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) with the Mode S beacon system. In ADS, an aircraft determines {{its position on}} board by using satellite navigational data from a system such as the Global Positioning System (GPS).

In GPS-Squitter, an aircraft would transmit the ADS information by using the Mode S squitter-a spontaneous periodic broadcast transmitted by all Mode S transponders. Currendy, the Mode S transponders emit a 56 -bit <b>squitter</b> once per second, and the squitters are used by the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) to acquire the 24 -bit address ofthe aircraft.

[2] Because the transmission of the data takes place on a shared broadcasting media, like the 1090 MHz Extended <b>Squitter</b> (ES) channel, the technology is {{also referred to as}} ADS-Broadcast (ADS-B) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{secondary}} {{surveillance radar}} (SSR), that is an evolution of the military identification friend-or-foe systems, is widely used by {{air traffic control service}} providers to localize and identify co-operating aircraft equipped with a standard transponder [1]. The ground SSR installation transmits interrogations, from a rotating, narrow azimuthal beam antenna. The airborne transponders, once they have received an interrogation, transmit at a 1, 090 -MHz carrier a reply signal containing the requested data, i. e., identity (mode A reply) or fight level (mode C reply). Azimuth and range of the aircraft are measured by the interrogator, based on the delay of the reply and on the antenna pointing angle. The current SSR standard is based on the use of selective interrogations and replies and is called mode S: to reduce the interferences, the mode S protocol is based on a message format that includes the unique address of the aircraft. The airborne segment of the SSR is composed of the transponder and a pair of antennas on top and {{on the bottom of the}} fuselage. As the aircraft antennas are omnidirectional, many ground stations can receive the replies. This allowed the development of multilateration (MLAT) systems for the aircraft localization based on 1, 090 -MHz signals [2]. A typical MLAT system is composed of a distributed network of 1, 090 -MHz sensors, an interconnecting facility, and a central processor for the fusion of the sensor data. The data fusion relies on the estimation of the signals arrival time at the different stations and on hyperbolic localization. To identify the emitters, the processing is done with mode A replies or mode S replies that contain the emitter identity. A transponder with mode S capability can also transmit a particular downlink format message, called <b>squitter,</b> containing the aircraft's unique address and other information. The <b>squitter</b> signals are not elicited by the SSR interrogation, but they are spontaneously emitted at pseudoperiodical intervals. They are the basis of the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) concept [3]: the ADS-B OUT function periodically transmits information (identity, position, state, etc.) about the aircraft, and the ADS-B IN function receives the messages from nearby traffic. On the airborne side, the ADS-B OUT broadcasts data with onboard equipment using the <b>squitter</b> signals. The airborne ADS-B IN equipment provides to the pilot the traffic scenario, receiving the messages from ground and nearby aircraft ADS-B OUT. Moreover, the ADS-B IN can receive other ground services: the traffic information services-broadcast (TIS-B) and the fight information services-broadcast (FIS-B) [3]. Airport vehicles can be equipped with an ADS-B OUT, a simplified, nonflyable device transmitting 1, 090 -MHz <b>squitter</b> signals containing the identity and the position. As a matter of fact, there are various users of the 1, 090 -MHz channel: 1) SSR transponder replies (modes A, C, S); 2) ADS-B OUT messages; 3) MLAT systems with interrogation capability; and 4) TIS-B.
