5000|$|Volume {{projections}} enable marketers {{to forecast}} <b>sales</b> <b>by</b> <b>sampling</b> customer intentions through surveys and market studies. By estimating how many customers will {{try a new}} product, and how often they’ll make repeat purchases, marketers can establish the basis for such projections[...] [...] [...] Projections from customer surveys are especially useful {{in the early stages}} of product development and in setting the timing for product launch. Through such projections, customer response can be estimated without the expense of a full product launch. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 56 percent responded that they found volume projections very useful.|$|R
