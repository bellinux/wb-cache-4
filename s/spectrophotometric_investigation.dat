A conductometric and <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>investigation</b> into the reaction between 1 – 4 and Br 2, carried out in MeCN, allows the equilibria involved {{in the formation of}} the isolated 10 -E- 3 (E=S, Se) hypervalent compounds to be hypothesised. In order to understand the reasons why S and Se donors can give different product types on treatment with Br 2 and I 2, DFT calculations have been carried out on 1 – 8, 19 and 20, and on their corresponding hypothetical [LEX]+ cations (L=organic framework; E=S, Se; X=Br, I), which are considered to be key intermediates {{in the formation of the}} different products. The results obtained in terms of NBO charge distribution on [LEX]+ species explain the different behaviour of 1 – 8, 19 and 20 in their reactions with Br 2 and I 2 fairly well. X-ray diffraction studies show 12 – 14 to have a T-shaped (10 -E- 3; E=S, Se) hypervalent chalcogen nature. They contain an almost linear Br-E-Br (E=S, Se) system roughly perpendicular to the average plane of the organic molecules. In 12, the Se atom of each adduct molecule has a short interaction with the Br(1) atom of an adjacent unit, such that the Se atom displays a roughly square planar coordination. The Se−Br distances are asymmetric [2. 529 (1) vs. 2. 608 (1) Å], the shorter distance being that with the Br(1) atom involved in the short intermolecular contact. In contrast, in the molecular adducts 13 and 14, which lie on a two-fold crystallographic axis, the Br-E-Br system is symmetric and no short intermolecular interactions involving chalcogen and bromine atoms are observed. The adducts are arranged in parallel planes; this gives rise to a graphite-like stacking. The new crystalline modification of 10, obtained from acetonitrile solution, confirms the importance of short intermolecular contacts in determining the asymmetry of Br-E-Br (E=S, Se) and I-Se-I groups in hypervalent 10 -E- 3 compounds. The analogies in the conductometric and spectrophotometric titrations of 1 and 2 – 4 with Br 2, together with the similarity of the vibrational spectra of 11 – 14, also imply a T-shaped nature for 11. The vibrational properties of the Br-E-Br (E=S, Se) systems resemble those of the Br 3 − and IBr 2 − anions: the Raman spectrum of a symmetric Br-E-Br group shows only one peak near 160 cm− 1, as found for symmetric Br 3 − and IBr 2 − anions, while asymmetric Br-E-Br groups also show an antisymmetric Br-E-Br mode at around 190 cm− 1, as observed for asymmetric Br 3 − and IBr 2 − ions. Therefore, simple IR and Raman measurements provide a useful tool for distinguishing between symmetric and asymmetric Br-E-Br groups, and hence allow predictions about the crystal packing of these hypervalent chalcogen compounds to be made when crystals of good quality are not available. ...|$|E

The composition of the complex was established by Job’s method of continuous variation (Huang et al. 2003; Mansour and Danielson 2012). The Job’s method of continuous variation has been used for determining the stoichiometry of coordination systems consisting of two interacting components (Huang et al. 2003). In this method the molar ratios are continuously varied while the total molar concentration of the two reactants is held constant. The binding stoichiometry is then determined from the ratio of the mole fractions of the two components found at the maximum of the curve (Huang et al. 2003). In the mole ratio method, varying amounts of ligand are added to a constant amount of metal ion. The absorbance of each solution is measured and plotted against the ratio of moles ligand/moles metal ions resulting in a curve having two straight line portions, while extrapolation gives the ratio of moles ligand/moles metal ion (Mansour and Danielson 2012). The application of Job’s method of continuous variation and mole ratio methods showed that 1 : 1 molar ratio is found in complex between Cu(II) and 2 -APT or 3 -APT reagent.

The trend of the wave speed v upon the increasing amount of {SDS} {{was found to have}} a maximum at {[SDS]} = 0. 075 mol dm 3 (v = 0. 071 mm s 1), after which the speed decreased to 0. 043 mm s 1 at {[SDS]} = 0. 5 mol dm 3, which is below the value found {{in the absence of the}} surfactant (v = 0. 055 mm s 1). The response of the oscillatory {BZ} system to the addition of {SDS} has been ascribed to two different causes: (a) the peculiar capability of the organized surfactant assemblies to affect the reactivity by selectively sequestering some key reacting species and (b) the modifications induced by {SDS} on the physical properties of the medium. These hypotheses have been corroborated by performing <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>investigations</b> on the stirred {BZ} system. Complementary viscosity measurements gave useful hints for the clarification of the surfactant role...|$|R
40|$|Although {{chromium}} coordination compounds are {{of considerable}} technological importance, {{they have been}} subjected to few thorough investigations since Werner's original experlments, {{in spite of the fact}} that we now possess a number of accurate physical methods, not available in Werner's time for the study of coordination complexes, The object of the work described in this thesis was to obtain further information on the chemistry of complex chromium(III) ions with special reference to the dioxalato-diaquochromiate system, [Cr(C₂ 0 ₄) ₂(H₂ 0) ₂]. For this purpose; spectrophotometric and potentlometrlc measurements were combined to yield information on a number of topics, The <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>investigations</b> consisted in measuring the absorption spectra of the potassium salts of the complexes under consideration and in observing the changes in light absorption which occur during their formatlon and decomposition. The instrument used was a Beckmann Quartz Spectrophotometer model du. More than than twelve new absorption spectra were measured in this work and in conjunction with the spectra of other chromium and cobalt complexes reported by earlier workers, these are used to review the position of spectrophotometry as a method of investigating chromium complexes. The reasons for the shapes of the absorption spectra are discussed and it is concluded that spectrophotometry is useful for observing the progress of reactions involving complex ions and for analysing solutions, but that more fundamental data cannot be expected from the absorption curves...|$|R

X-ray diffraction {{analysis of the}} complexes reveals a Cu Cu distance of 2. 9183 (13), 2. 9604 (6), 3. 0278 (4) and 3. 0569 (11) Å, respectively. In 1 the metal coordination geometry is intermediate between trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) and square pyramidal (SP) (t = 0. 488), in 2 the geometry is TBP (0. 828 and 0. 639) and in 3 and 4 is SP (t = 0. 188 and 0. 083, respectively). <b>Spectrophotometric</b> <b>investigations</b> to evaluate the catecholase activity of complexes against 3, 5 -di-tert-butylcatechol (3, 5 -DTBC) and tetrachlorocatechol (TCC) in three different solvents (acetonitrile, methanol and DMSO) under completely aerobic conditions reveal that complexes 1 – 4 are able to oxidise 3, 5 -DTBC in all the solvents, while TCC can be oxidised only in acetonitrile (kcat = 0. 0002 – 0. 02 s 1).

40|$|AbstractIn {{the course}} of {{oxidation}} of thiols by peroxidases thiyl radicals are formed which are known to undergo several free-radical conjugative reactions, among others leading to hydrogen peroxide formation. The present paper {{for the first time}} presents a comparative transient-state and steady-state investigation of the reaction of 15 aliphatic and aromatic mono- and dithiols with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Both sequential-stopped-flow <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>investigations</b> of the reaction of HRP intermediates Compound I (k 2) and Compound II (k 3) with thiols and measurements of the overall thiol oxidation and the simultaneous oxygen consumption in the presence and absence of exogenously added hydrogen peroxide (10 μM) have been performed. With HRP as thiyl radical generator it was shown that three groups of thiols have to be distinguished: (i) Aromatic thiols (e. g. thiophenol, 2 -mercaptopurine) were excellent electron donors of both Compounds (k 2 : 104 – 107 M− 1 s− 1 and k 3 : 103 – 106 M− 1 s− 1); however, the overall reaction was shown to depend on addition of hydrogen peroxide, indicating insufficient peroxide regeneration by arylthiyl radicals. (ii) Aliphatic thiols which were extremely bad substrates (k 3 9. 5 (e. g. N-acetylcysteine, α-lipoic acid) were also shown to depend on exogenously added H 2 O 2 to maintain the peroxidasic reaction, whereas (iii) with those thiols with rates of k 3 between 11 and 1600 M− 1 s− 1 (e. g. cysteine, cysteamine, cysteine methyl ester, cysteine ethyl ester) and/or with a pKa,SH < 8 (penicillamine) thiol oxidation was independent of exogenously added hydrogen peroxide, indicating sufficient hydrogen peroxide regeneration...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was {{investigation}} of synthesis and sinterability of nanometric zirconia solid solution powders containing 8 mol% and 3 mol% of Y 2 O 3. The powders were prepared by the hydrothermal treatment of the co-precipitated gels, which resulted in very fine powders with particle sizes < 10 nm. The main problem in application of such fine powders is their tendency to form hard agglomerates. To overcome this obstacle, the aqueous suspensions of the powders were subjected to the freeze drying. It resulted in the powders composed of very weak agglomerates which were broken under pressure as low as ∼ 1 MPa. The powder compacts were sintered in oxygen atmosphere to the state of closed porosity and then HIP-ed at 1300 °C to fully dense ceramics. The <b>spectrophotometric</b> <b>investigations</b> in the wave length range of 190 – 1100 nm indicated higher translucency of the 8 mol% Y 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 than the 3 mol% Y 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 ceramics. Most probably it should be related to the birefringence phenomenon which occurs in the latter case due to the tetragonal symmetry of this material. In the polycrystal containing 8 mol% of Y 2 O 3 this phenomenon does not occur due to its cubic symmetry. The other two factors which lead to the decreased optical transparency of the material containing 3 mol% Y 2 O 3 are its smaller grain sizes and the presence of some amount of the monoclinic phase...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{reaction}} of 2, 3 -dichloro- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone (DCNQ) with crizotinib (CZT; a novel drug used {{for treatment of}} non-small cell lung cancer) was investigated in different solvents of varying dielectric constants and polarity indexes. The reaction produced a red-colored product. <b>Spectrophotometric</b> <b>investigations</b> confirmed that the reaction proceeded through charge–transfer (CT) complex formation. The molar absorptivity of the complex {{was found to be}} linearly correlated with the dielectric constant and polarity index of the solvent; the correlation coefficients were 0. 9567 and 0. 9069, respectively. The stoichiometric ratio of DCNQ:CZT was found to be 2 : 1 and the association constant of the complex was found to be 1. 07 × 102 l/mol. The kinetics of the reaction was studied; the order of the reaction, rate and rate constant were determined. Computational molecular modeling for the complex between DCNQ and CZT was conducted, the sites of interaction on CZT molecule were determined, and the mechanism of the reaction was postulated. The reaction was employed as a basis {{in the development of a}} novel 96 -microwell assay for CZT in a linear range of 4 – 500 μg/ml. The assay limits of detection and quantitation were 2. 06 and 6. 23 μg/ml, respectively. The assay was validated as per the guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and successfully applied to the analysis of CZT in its bulk and capsules with good accuracy and precision. The assay has high throughput and consumes a minimum volume of organic solvents thus it reduces the exposures of the analysts to the toxic effects of organic solvents, and significantly reduces the analysis cost...|$|R
