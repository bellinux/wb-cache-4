40|$|Cash-rich bidders in UK {{have better}} {{announcement}} abnormal returns than cash-poor ones during 1984 - 2007, contrasting previous {{findings in the}} US. The positive <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> effect is mainly from bidders of high long-run growth or those with non-trivial institutional holdings. Moreover, cash-rich bidders' post-acquisition operating performance is positively related to bidder <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> and institutional holdings. Our results suggest the precautionary motive underlies bidder <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> effects. Specifically, cash-rich bidders are better positioned to capture growth opportunities arising from acquisitions. Our results also suggest that strong shareholder power is necessary to ensure <b>cash</b> <b>reserved</b> {{in the interests of}} shareholders...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The {{amount of}} <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> in {{corporations}} has increased substantially {{over the years}} on a global scale. There are opinions that support hoarding cash in corporate stating that such action can save cost from raising expensive external capital. However, there are also opinions that high amount of <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> leads to agency problems and induces managers to take on value decreasing investments. I study the relationship between <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> and M&A activity in Europe to see if hoarding <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> is detrimental or beneficial for corporates. DATA AND METHODS: My data collecting period is from 1995 to 2014. Mostly, I collect company financial information from Thomson One and deals information from SDC. First, I conduct normal cash model to {{determine the amount of}} excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> for each firm year taking into account the industry and firm's specific characteristics. Then, I use the probit models to see if excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> lead to higher probability of becoming a bidder or a target in M&A. Finally, I use panel regressions to see if M&A made by cash-rich firm is value increasing. In my models, first I study Europe as a whole and then I look into individual countries to examine the situation in each country. RESULTS: For Europe as a whole, the results are not conclusive. High amount of excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> does lead to higher probability of becoming a bidder of a firm. However, the regression models cannot conclude if these investments are detrimental. The investments are only value-decreasing under the combined effect of high <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> and low investment opportunities. For individual countries, the picture is more clear. In France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy, managers tend to take advantage of <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> in a company as {{they are more likely to}} engage in M&A and the investments they make are value-decreasing. However, in United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden, managers seem to hoard <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> for shareholders' benefits.

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of U. K. bidder {{companies}} from 1984 through 2007, we find that announcement returns are better for bidders of higher excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserve.</b> This suggests that acquisitions by high excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> bidders are not necessarily value-decreasing as {{is suggested by the}} agency theory and found in the U. S. market. Managers may need cash to ensure that all potential good investment opportunities are financed internally if not externally due to high costs of external funds. Moreover, a company of higher excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> {{is more likely to be}} a bidder, and a bidder of higher excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> has better operating performance than a low-excess-cash-reserve bidder in postacquisition years. Overall, our results suggest that, in the U. K., growth opportunities dominate agency conflicts as the underlying mechanism that drives the wealth effects of corporate <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> in acquisitions. This possibly can be explained by the fact that the U. K. regulation of takeovers attempts to ensure that actions taken by managements should be preceded by close shareholder scrutiny...|$|R
40|$|We study a continuous-time {{contracting}} problem under hidden action, {{where the}} prin-cipal has ambiguous {{beliefs about the}} project cash flows.

40|$|Corporate <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> has {{an adverse}} {{selection}} effect. Specifically, if investors know a {{company does not}} have to issue to invest, an attempt to do so sends a strong signal of overvaluation. This notion has not been explicitly studied in the extant empirical literature, despite its intuitiveness. Using a sample of acquisitions solely financed by stock to exclude the potential complications of free cash flow, I find that announcement returns are lower for a bidder with a higher excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserve.</b> This effect is stronger in hot equity market years or when a bidder's standalone value is more difficult to evaluate. I also find evidence supporting the idea that targets request cash payment to remove "lemon" bidders in normal (non-hot equity market) years, but accept too many stock offers in hot equity market years. After acquisitions, high-excess-cash-reserve bidders operationally outperform low-excess-cash-reserve bidders. Further, they spend more funds on reducing debt but not more on investments, compared with low-excess-cash-reserve bidders. Combined, these results show that <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> has information costs. Further, they highlight the importance of the two-sided information asymmetry framework of Rhodes-Kropf and Viswanathan (2004) in describing merger outcomes without resorting to behavioral or agency explanations.

40|$|Rhodes-Kropf and Viswanathan (2004) {{suggest an}} adverse {{selection}} role of corporate <b>cash</b> <b>reserve.</b> Specifically, if investors know a bidder {{does not have}} to issue to invest, an attempt to do so sends a strong pessimistic signal of overvaluation. Despite its intuitiveness, this notion has not been explicitly studied in the empirical literature. Using a sample of acquisitions that are solely financed by the bidders' equity to exclude the potential complications of free cash flow, I find that firms with higher excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> are more likely than other firms to attempt acquisitions that are solely financed by stock. I further confirm that a bidder's excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> has an adverse wealth effect at deal announcement. The adverse wealth effect of <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> is stronger in the hot equity market period when aggregate information asymmetry is arguably high, and for the bidders whose stand alone values are more difficult to assess. In the post-acquisition years, highexcess-cash-reserve bidders operationally out perform low-excess-cash-reserve ones. Moreover, they spend more funds on debt reduction but no more on investments than low-excess-cashreserve bidders do.

Research results of analysed data of banks' <b>cash</b> <b>reserves,</b> bank credit, GDP and cash holdings by banks from 2004 - 2014 using GARCH model {{show that there}} exists volatility in the study variables; and a positive and significant relationship exists between volatility in banks' <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> and <b>cash</b> held by banks in Nigeria and volatility in bank credit indicating that <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement as a liquidity management tool is ineffective in Nigeria in controlling bank lending suggesting that reserve requirements may not effectively constrain bank lending as banks seem to circumvent regulatory controls, creating credit through other means. This necessitates the Central Bank of Nigeria to opt for other liquidity management tools such as introduction of changes in credit window that would enhance cash management. The positive and significant relationship between volatility in bank credit and Nigeria's GDP necessitates the implementation of monetary policies aimed at increasing credit advances to increase production and economic growth. bank cash reserves; bank credit volatility; GDP; gross dometic product; Nigeria; post-consolidation; <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> volatility; bank credits; economic growth; central banks; banking industry; bank lending; regulatory controls; liquidity management; credit window; cash management; monetary policy...|$|R

30|$|In {{examining}} the interaction effect, {{there is a}} potential endogeneity concern with excess cash. Managers of firms with a large number of ATPs may accumulate excess cash for managerial perquisites. Thus, if firms with a large number of ATPs tend to hoard large <b>cash</b> <b>reserves,</b> it is difficult to identify the interaction effect. While evidence from outside the US suggests that weak shareholder rights are associated with higher <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> (Lins and Kalcheva 2007), other studies show that US firms with a large number of ATPs hold lower excess cash (Harford et al. 2008). In a setting with strong shareholder rights protection and enforcement, entrenched managers in the US rather prefer to dissipate excess cash quickly in value-destroying investments because large <b>cash</b> <b>reserves</b> are too visible target of shareholder activism. This managerial preference drives the negative association between ATPs and excess cash.|$|R
