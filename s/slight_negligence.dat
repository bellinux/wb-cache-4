50|$|The {{negligence}} {{need not}} be extreme; <b>slight</b> <b>negligence</b> created the liability. This rule raises the question, {{where there was a}} contract between the parties in which culpa did not create liability, e.g. deposit, whether damage caused by negligence created the Aquilian liability.

50|$|The {{failure of}} the Midway Operation was caused by <b>slight</b> <b>negligence,</b> but the effects were so {{tremendous}} that Japanese Army operations in the Pacific were shaken to their very roots. Because of the failure, the Japanese Navy also lost its mastery forever, since a quick recovery from the smashing blow to the carrier fleet was impossible. It was difficult for Japan either to build large aircraft carriers or to train skilled airmen overnight.|$|E

Furthermore, juries regularly mitigated the damages they awarded, rather than applying the all-or-nothing rule. The idea of a partition of damages seems to have emerged in English common law around the end of the 19 th century. In 1945, the possibility of a reduction, based on the respective degrees of the responsibility of the parties, was officially introduced with the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act, which is still in force today...|$|R
