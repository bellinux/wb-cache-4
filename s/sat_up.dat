5|$|The tiger {{has been}} one of the big five game animals of Asia. Tiger hunting took place on a large scale in the early 19th and 20th centuries, being a {{recognised}} and admired sport by the British in colonial India as well as the maharajas and aristocratic class of the erstwhile princely states of pre-independence India. A single maharaja or English hunter could claim to kill over a hundred tigers in their hunting career. Tiger hunting was done by some hunters on foot; others <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> on machans with a goat or buffalo tied out as bait; yet others on elephant-back.|$|E
5|$|Much as {{they had}} in {{previous}} stages, race leader Denis Menchov {{and the man in}} second place Danilo Di Luca stayed right with one another all through the climb, as Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov with attacks, but was unable to. Pellizotti, who had also been holding their wheels, took the opportunity with the two of them taking energy out of each other, to come clear and move into third position on the road. Basso, who was up the road, dutifully <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> and waited for his better-placed teammate and paced him to a small gap over Menchov and Di Luca before cracking. It was enough to ensure Pellizotti second on the stage, to keep him third in the overall classification. Di Luca managed to outsprint Menchov to the line and claim 8 bonus seconds to narrow his deficit to 18 seconds, but with only a flat stage and an individual time trial remaining the superior time trialist Menchov had the advantage.|$|E
5|$|The next match pitted the Undertaker against Kamala, who was {{accompanied}} by his manager, Harvey Wippleman, and his handler, Kim Chee. Kamala attacked before the match but the Undertaker blocked the attack and punched Kamala repeatedly before performing a chop from the top rope on his opponent. The Undertaker attempted the same move again, but Wippleman knocked the Undertaker off the rope. Kamala knocked the Undertaker outside the ring, where the Undertaker attacked Wippleman and Kim Chee. Back inside the ring, the Undertaker gained the advantage by executing a chokeslam and a clothesline. When the Undertaker attempted his signature move, the Tombstone Piledriver, Kim Chee ran into the ring and hit the Undertaker with a pith helmet. As a result, Kamala was disqualified and the Undertaker won the match. Kamala kept on attacking and hit Undertaker {{with a series of}} splashes and seemingly left his opponent unconscious. When the Undertaker suddenly <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> and looked directly at the Ugandan Giant, Kamala, Whippleman and Kim Chee panicked and fled ringside with The Undertaker and Paul Bearer slowly walking in pursuit.|$|E
60|$|Part of {{the time}} it rained, and then she <b>sat</b> huddled <b>up</b> in the shawls and {{tarpaulins}} which the woman placed about her: then, when the sun came out, she still <b>sat</b> huddled <b>up,</b> closing her eyes against the glare.|$|R
60|$|Dick <b>sat</b> hunched <b>up,</b> {{with the}} paddle on the deck, and they heard him laugh.|$|R
60|$|He <b>sat</b> looking <b>up</b> {{where the}} big moon swam through the black {{branches}} of the yew.|$|R
5|$|In {{the final}} match of the evening, The All-Americans, {{consisting}} of Lex Luger, The Undertaker, and The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott), competed against the Foreign Fanatics (Yokozuna, Ludvig Borga, Quebecer Jacques, and Crush). Scott Steiner and Jacques began the match, but Scott soon tagged in his brother Rick. Rick knocked Yokozuna {{out of the}} ring, but {{he was unable to}} perform much offense against Borga. Rick attempted a crossbody, during which Borga was supposed to catch him. Borga botched the move, but he pinned Rick anyway to eliminate him from the match. Crush faced Scott Steiner inside the ring, but Randy Savage then appeared in the aisle {{trying to get to the}} ring but was restrained by officials and The Smoking Gunns. Scott knocked Crush out of the ring, and Crush fought with Savage until being counted out of the match. Scott then turned his attention to Jacques before tagging Luger into the match. Luger eliminated Jacques with an elbow drop and a pinfall. Scott Steiner re-entered the match and executed a superplex on Borga. When he tried to pin Borga, however, Yokozuna entered the ring. Yokozuna performed a leg drop on Steiner and pinned him to even the match at two wrestlers each. Luger fought with Borga and Yokozuna before tagging The Undertaker into the match. The Undertaker gained control of the match, but Yokozuna turned the momentum around by performing his signature move, the Banzai drop, on The Undertaker. When he attempted the move a second time, The Undertaker <b>sat</b> <b>up.</b> The two men then fought outside the ring until both were counted out and eliminated from the match. Luger and Borga then fought back and forth until Luger performed a running forearm smash and pinned Borga to win the match. After the match, Santa Claus came to the ring to celebrate with Luger.|$|E
25|$|In the 1973/74 season Ellerslie won the ACA Major Club Championship for clubs with 4 or more {{teams in}} their ranks {{which was a}} great feather in its cap because from then on {{everyone}} <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> and respected Ellerslie as a club of the future.|$|E
25|$|Wieland's minimalism {{extended}} beyond the stage furniture and props. The performer of Gunther, for example, {{was expected to}} sing leaning forward in Act 1 of Götterdämmerung until he felt his authority challenged by Hagen and <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> straight. It {{is hard to imagine}} a greater contrast with traditional operatic acting.|$|E

25|$|In the {{afternoon}} a variety concert, 'Pop goes Australia', featured musicians Normie Rowe, Bobby Limb, Rolf Harris and The Seekers. The entire 10-hour program was televised live and {{several hundred thousand}} people across Australia <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> through the night to watch it. One newspaper reported that the picture was so clear that hundreds of viewers rang a Sydney television station to seek assurance that the pictures really were being broadcast live from Canada.|$|E
25|$|Before {{he could}} be ordained a priest, Gabriel died in the retreat at Isola del Gran Sasso {{the early hours of}} February 27, 1862, in the {{presence}} of the community, holding close an image of Our Lady of Sorrows and smiling peacefully. Those who were with Gabriel when he died reported that at the moment of death, he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in bed and his face became radiant as he reached out to an otherwise unseen figure that was entering the room. It was the opinion of Father Norbert that Saint Gabriel had seen the Virgin Mary at the very moment of his death.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{believed}} {{he needed to}} confirm the trials and sentences. He concluded that some men deserved less punishment, and <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> nights attempting to find excuses to avoid the universal application of capital punishment. In the end he approved {{the death penalty for}} 50 of the 72 San Patricios, but later pardoned five and reduced the sentence of fifteen others, including the ringleader, Sergeant John Riley. This left 30 slated for execution, 16 of whom were hanged on September 10, 1847. Four were hanged the next day, and the remainder assigned to Colonel William Harney for execution at some later date.|$|E
60|$|Lawford <b>sat</b> drawn <b>up,</b> {{staring at}} his companion's face in an intense and {{helpless}} silence. His mouth opened but no words came.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned again}} to his maps. Bert <b>sat</b> {{crumpled}} <b>up</b> in the corner, apparently heedless of him. For some time both kept silence.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel still <b>sat</b> looking <b>up</b> at her face, and {{watching}} {{the effect of the}} poison of ambition which he had artfully instilled into her mind.|$|R
25|$|At about 11:45pm ship's time Gracie was jarred awake by a jolt. He <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> {{realized}} the ship's engines {{were no longer}} moving, and partially dressed, putting on a Norfolk jacket over his regular clothes. Reaching the Boat Deck, he {{realized the}} ship was listing slightly. He returned to his cabin {{to put on his}} life jacket and on the way back found the women he had been chaperoning. He escorted them up to the Boat Deck and made sure they entered lifeboats. He then retrieved blankets for the women in the boats, and along with his friend Smith assisted Second Officer Charles Lightoller in filling the remaining lifeboats with women and children.|$|E
25|$|VanDerveer {{sent out}} resumes to twenty schools, {{looking for a}} {{graduate}} assistant job, which is an unpaid position. She only got two responses, {{one of which was}} for Ohio State, where the athletic director had remembered her from Indiana. To prepare herself, she attended a coaching clinic taught by Knight. When she had attended his practices, she had stayed out of sight, but enrolled in a class, she followed her parents advice and <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> front. One of the coaches asked if she was lost. Knight embarrassed her with one of his questions, but she didn't stop attending, although she moved back a few rows. She was hired as an assistant coach to the varsity and the head coach of the JV.|$|E
25|$|In Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English Church and People {{written in}} AD 731 is {{recorded}} {{the case of}} a Cunningham of Northumbria who died after a gradually worsening illness. All his grieving family were gathered around his corpse when he suddenly <b>sat</b> <b>up.</b> Everyone ran away, apart from his wife to whom he told the story of his adventure. He had been guided in death by a man in a shining robe to a broad, deep, dark valley of infinite length and from here he crossed a high wall beyond which was a broad and pleasant meadow. His guide told him that he had to return to live amongst men again and despite his reluctance to go he found himself back in his body again, alive.|$|E
6000|$|... “I’m all right—all right,” Morgan panted to Pemberton, whom he <b>sat</b> looking <b>up</b> at with {{a strange}} smile, his hands resting {{on either side of}} the sofa.|$|R
60|$|But Evelyn did not move. She <b>sat</b> looking <b>up</b> at {{him with}} her bright eager eyes, {{in the depths of}} which he thought he {{detected}} some disappointment, or dissatisfaction.|$|R
60|$|The {{second day}} was {{exactly like the}} first. The rain {{continued}} to pour down, and we <b>sat,</b> wrapped <b>up</b> in our mackintoshes, underneath the canvas, and drifted slowly down.|$|R
25|$|The {{other main}} match on the undercard was the Undertaker versus Reigns. The match was made after Reigns {{interfered}} in the Undertaker's match during the Number One Contenders tournament. This interference cost the Undertaker his match, and his opportunity to {{challenge for the}} WWE Championship at WrestleMania. The following week, Reigns cut a promo on the Undertaker, and claimed that he wasn't scared of him. On February 17, the Undertaker faced Reigns' tag team partner, Jindrak, immediately after Reigns had defeated Nunzio and cut another promo on the Undertaker. The Undertaker pinned Jindrak after a Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver. Reigns then hit the Undertaker with a television camera. The Undertaker, however, quickly recovered, <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in the ring, and then stalked Reigns to the backstage area.|$|E
25|$|The {{two were}} quickly {{joined by a}} {{counter-attack}} from Axel Merckx and Sandy Casar; Boogerd and Lefevre <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> and allowed those two to join them. Casar struck a dog on the road when he and Frederick Willems were chasing Boogerd and Lefevre, {{and both of them}} went down. Casar got up quickly, but Willems was slower and wound up being absorbed by the peloton. The crash resulted in Casar tearing his gear and having to ride with a nasty wound on his exposed buttocks, since dropping off to change and have the wound treated would cost him his position. Later, the race doctor's car made it up to the leading group to tend to Casar's hip and right elbow, as well as a bee sting sustained by Boogerd.|$|E
25|$|Wilson <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> till {{midnight on}} 4 July (three {{days after the}} Panther arrived at Agadir {{in an attempt to}} overawe the French) writing a long minute to the CIGS. On 19 July he went to Paris for talks with Adolphe Messimy (French War Minister) and General Dubail (French Chief of Staff). The Wilson-Dubail memorandum, {{although}} making explicit that neither government was committed to action, promised that in the event of war the Royal Navy would transport six infantry and one cavalry divisions (totaling 150,000 men) to Rouen, Le Havre and Boulogne, and that the BEF would concentrate between Arras, Cambrai and St Quentin by the thirteenth day of mobilisation. In reality, the transport plans were nowhere near ready, although it is unclear that the French knew this. The French called the Expeditionary Force “l’Armee Wilson” although they seem to have been left with an inflated idea of the size of commitment which Britain would send.|$|E
6000|$|In the evening, {{putting her}} cheek against her brother's {{shoulder}} {{as she was}} sitting by him, while he <b>sat</b> propped <b>up</b> in bed under a new difficulty of breathing, she said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|He thrust {{away his}} glass {{once and for}} all, and <b>sat</b> {{straight}} <b>up</b> in the chair {{where he had been}} previously lolling. [...] "What am I to understand?" [...] said he.|$|R
6000|$|At {{two o'clock}} that night Carry was awakened to see Patty bending over her, flushed and radiant. Carry <b>sat</b> sleepily <b>up.</b> [...] "I hope {{you had a}} good time," [...] she said.|$|R
25|$|Heinz Heydrich was an Obersturmführer (lieutenant), {{journalist}} {{and publisher of}} the soldiers' newspaper, Die Panzerfaust. He was at first a fervent admirer of Hitler. But before Reinhard Heydrich’s State funeral in Berlin in June 1942, Heinz Heydrich had been given a large packet containing his brother’s files, released from his strongbox at Gestapo Headquarters, 8 Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse, Berlin. Heinz had shut himself away in his room with the papers. Next morning his wife noticed that her husband had <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> all night burning the documents from the package. Heinz, on leave from the front, could not be engaged in conversation, his wife remembered; he seemed to be elsewhere mentally, and like stone. The files in the package were probably Reinhard Heydrich’s personal files, from which Heinz Heydrich understood {{for the first time in}} all its enormity the systematic extermination of the Jews, the so-called Final Solution. Thereafter, Heinz Heydrich helped many Jews escape by forging identity documents and printing them on Die Panzerfaust presses.|$|E
500|$|Then, I {{looked over}} and saw this man on the extreme right aisle sort of {{galloping}} to the podium. He was tall, he was thin, {{and the way he}} was galloping it looked as though he was going someplace much more important than the podium. ... He got to the podium—and I <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> straight. I was impressed with him.|$|E
500|$|The first {{breakaway}} of the {{day came}} from Jonathan Hivert (...) [...] He attacked alone and took both the mountains points and the victory at the first intermediate sprint. Despite at one point having a lead of nearly four minutes, he <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> and was caught by the peloton. Michael Matthews (...) , in eighth place after the prologue, took {{second place in the}} intermediate sprint to win two bonus seconds, moving him to ten seconds behind Kwiatkowski, while John Degenkolb (...) took a second for finishing third.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not answer}} this, {{not knowing what to}} say. The mother <b>sat</b> bunched <b>up</b> in silence, her {{beautiful}} white hands, that had no rings whatsoever, clasping the pommels of her arm-chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{he really}} say that?" [...] cried Daisy, {{watching}} the bob-o-link, who <b>sat</b> swaying <b>up</b> {{and down on}} the green bough, and nodding his white-capped head at her in the most friendly manner.|$|R
60|$|It {{was lucky}} {{that the dog}} had been fed, for in ten minutes nothing was left but the napkin; and the boys <b>sat</b> picking <b>up</b> the crumbs, much refreshed, but ready for more.|$|R
