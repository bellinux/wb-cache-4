40|$|Abstract: We herein {{describe}} {{a case of}} an unusual multicentric castleman disease(MCD) accompanied by Thrombocytopenia, Anasarca, myeloFibrosis and Renal failure, compatible with TAFRO syndrome and associated with <b>Sjogren</b> <b>disease.</b> The treatment with corticosteroids dramatically improved the symptoms. The clinical features of this case {{were similar to those}} reported previously in Japan but this appears to be the first European MCD with negative HHV 8 and HIV that meets the criteria of TAFRO syndrome, associated with <b>Sjögren</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|E
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} prospectively {{the prevalence}} of other autoimmune disorders in outpatient clinic in 3069 consecutive patients with diagnosed chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (AT), with respect to two age- and sex-matched control groups: a) a control group of 1023 subjects, extracted from {{a random sample of}} the general population without thyroid disorders; b) 1023 patients with non-toxic multinodular goiter extracted from the same random sample of the general population, with similar iodine intake. The results of our study demonstrate a significant increase of {{the prevalence of}} autoimmune disorders in AT patients (with respect to both controls), for the following diseases: chronic autoimmune gastritis (CAG), vitiligo (Vit), rheumatoid arthritis, polymialgia rheumatica (Polym), celiac disease, diabetes, <b>sjogren</b> <b>disease,</b> multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, alopecia, psoriathic arthritis, systemic sclerosis, and HCV-related cryoglobulinemia. While the statistical analysis reached near the significance for Addison's disease and ulcerative colitis. Interestingly, the association of three autoimmune disorders was observed almost exclusively in AT patients, and the most frequent associations were AT+CAG+Vit and AT+CAG+Polym. We suggest that patients with AT who remain unwell, or who develop new not specific symptoms (despite adequate treatment) should be screened for other autoimmune disorders, avoiding the delay in the diagnosis of these disorders...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To compare {{systemic}} disease activity by validated tools, i. e., the European League Against Rheumatism <b>Sjögren</b> Syndrome <b>Disease</b> Activity Index (ESSDAI) and the Clinical ESSDAI (ClinESSDAI) scores, between primary Sjögren syndrome (pSS) with positive serum cryoglobulins and pSS without serum cryoglobulins. Methods. There were 825 consecutive patients with pSS who were retrospectively evaluated. Results. The ESSDAI and the ClinESSDAI scores {{were significantly higher}} in cryoglobulin-positive patients (p < 0. 0001, for both scores). Cryoglobulinemia {{was significantly associated with}} these domains: Constitutional (p = 0. 003), lymphadenopathy (p = 0. 007), glandular (p = 0. 0002), cutaneous (p < 0. 0001), peripheral nervous system (p < 0. 0001), hematological (p = 0. 004), and biological (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|Hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis (HCP) is an {{uncommon}} disorder that causes a localized or diffuse thickening of the dura mater {{and has been}} reported to be infrequently associated with systemic autoimmune disorders such as Wegener’s granulomatosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, Behçet’s <b>disease,</b> <b>Sjögren</b> syndrome, and temporal arteritis. Here, we report a case of HCP initially presented with scleritis and headache in a patient with undifferenciated connective tissue disease (UCTD). HCP was initially suspected on brain magnetic resonance imaging and defined pathologically on meningial biopsy. Immunologic studies showed the presence of anti-RNP antibody. After high dose corticosteroid therapy, the patient’s symptoms and radiologic abnormalities of brain were improved. Our case suggested that HCP should be considered in the differential diagnosis of headache in a patient with UCTD presenting with scleritis...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of human}} saliva as a {{diagnostic}} and prognostic fluid has until recently been somewhat disregarded. Although sample collection is non-invasive, physiological and genetic variations were {{largely responsible for}} its infrequent application in the past. Recently, several proteomic studies contributed to partial elucidation of the salivary proteome (more than 2400 protein components have been characterized), {{both in terms of}} composition, contributions to whole saliva and genetic/physiological variability. On this basis, is not too optimistic to believe that in the near future human saliva could become a relevant diagnostic fluid. In this review, the characterization by proteomic approaches of new salivary markers in oncology, head and neck carcinoma (oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, and salivary glands), breast and gastric cancers, salivary gland function and <b>disease,</b> <b>Sjogren</b> syndrome, systemic sclerosis, dental and gingival pathology, systemic, psychiatric and neurological diseases, is described...|$|R
40|$|Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) is a nonmalignant histiocytic {{disorder}} of unknown origin that is extremely rare. By immunohistochemistry, the RDD cells are characteristically S- 100 positive and CD 1 a negative. Emperipolesis {{is a common}} histopathological finding, although not specific for RDD. Lymph node and cutaneous manifestations are most frequent, but diverse organs can be affected. The clinical course is unpredictable regardless of treatment. Here, we present a series of 8 cases presenting lymph node and/or cutaneous lesions. Lymph node involvement was seen in diverse regions, including mediastinal and retroperitoneal. The treatment response to steroids was diversified, and the chemotherapy response was disappointing.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS), {{the most}} frequent demyelinating disease in adults, {{is thought to be}} an autoimmune disease. Symptoms and signs observed in MS reflect lesions present mainly in the white matter of the central nervous system (CNS). The diagnosis remains difficult, at least concerning presenting symptoms, because of their low specificity. Diagnosis criteria are usually based on dissemination of signs in time and space, evoked potentials, findings of magnetic resonance imaging, results of cerebrospinal fluid examination, and the exclusion of other diagnosis possibly explaining the clinical signs. However, no clinical and paraclinical investigation can distinguish with certainity MS from other conditions such as autoimmune or inflammatory diseases predominantly affecting the central nervous system. These other disorders include systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, Behcet <b>disease,</b> <b>Sjogren</b> syndrome, sarcoidosis and vasculitides. We present four clinical cases showing the difficulty in reaching a proper diagnosis [...] ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} quality of sexual life of women with primary Sjögren {{syndrome}} (pSS) and to identify its correlations with disease activity and damage, quality of life, and mood disorders. METHODS: The quality of sexual life of 24 women with pSS was assessed with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Twenty-four healthy women, matched by age and hormonal status, were enrolled as controls. Mood disorders {{and quality of life}} were investigated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form- 36. Patients underwent a gynecological visit with vaginal pH measurement, cervicovaginal swabs, and Pap smears. Disease activity and damage were assessed by the European League Against Rheumatism <b>Sjögren</b> syndrome <b>disease</b> activity and damage indexes. RESULTS: Patients with pSS showed a pathological mean FSFI score (19. 1 ± 7. 33) significantly different from controls (p = 0. 004), both in menstruating women (p = 0. 006) and in menopausal women (p = 0. 03). Major differences between the 2 groups were detected in dyspareunia (p < 0. 005), lubrication (p = 0. 006), desire (p = 0. 004), and arousal (p = 0. 018). The FSFI score was inversely correlated with age (p = 0. 008) and anxiety HADS (p = 0. 031). No early anatomical changes, swabs, and Pap smear alterations were revealed in patients with pSS; however, vaginal pH was higher than normal in premenopausal patients (6. 0 ± 0. 77). CONCLUSION: Both premenopausal and postmenopausal women with pSS have a worse sexual quality of life. We reported a greater prevalence of dyspareunia that is statistically significant when compared with controls. The FSFI could be a useful tool to assess this topic, but has been neglected in the care of patients with pSS heretofore...|$|R
40|$|Alpha II-spectrin {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{proteins}} responsible for maintaining the cytoskeletal integrity of the cell. The caspase 3 -mediated cleavage of alpha II-spectrin during apoptotic cell death may play an important role in altering membrane stability and the formation of apoptotic bodies. In this study, we identified the primary caspase 3 cleavage site in alpha II-spectrin. We found that the transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D, induced caspase 3 activation and that caspase 3 activation is coincident with the cleavage of alpha II-spectrin protein at a primary cleavage site. Deletion analysis and site directed mutagenesis identified the primary cleavage site in alpha II spectrin at amino acid 1185 (DETD). The primary caspase 3 cleavage site in alpha II spectrin is conserved in immature and mature B cells. Our results indicate that alpha II-spectrin is initially cleaved at a caspase 3 consensus site and this primary event likely alters the structural conformation of the protein exposing subsequent cleavage sites and altering cytoskeletal integrity. Identification of the primary cleavage site for caspase 3 may help to elucidate the role of alpha II-spectrin in membrane stability and apoptosis as well as provide new insights into alpha II-spectrin autoantibody formation associated with the autoimmune <b>disease,</b> <b>Sjögren</b> 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome...|$|R
50|$|The {{clinical}} {{relevance of}} the PSMB9 protein can be found mostly {{in the areas of}} infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and oncology. For instance, it has been verified that mRNA coding for PSMB9 (together with CFD, MAGED1, PRDX4 and FCGR3B) is differentially expressed between patients who developed clinical symptoms associated with the mild disease type of Dengue fever, and patients who showed clinical symptoms associated with severe Dengue. The study suggests that this gene expression panel may serve as biomarkers of clinical prognosis in Dengue hemorrhagic fever. Further studies also indicate a role for PMSB9, in a panel with 9 other genes (Zbp1, Mx2, Irf7, Lfi47, Tapbp, Timp1, Trafd1, Tap2) in the development of influenza vaccines, and in the diagnosis of autoimmune <b>disease</b> <b>Sjogren</b> syndrome in conjunction with 18 other genes (EPSTI1, IFI44,IFI44L, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, MX1, OAS1, SAMD9L, STAT1, HERC5, EV12B, CD53, SELL, HLA-DQA1, PTPRC, B2M, and TAP2). With regards to oncology, PSMB9 in conjunction with other genes that are involved with immune response processes (TAP1, PSMB8, PSMB9, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQB2, HLA-DMA, and HLA-DOA) may form a comprehensive assessment of the clinical outcome in epithelial ovarian carcinoma tumor methylation assessments. The study suggest that an epigenetically mediated immune response is a predictor of recurrence and, possibly, treatment response for high-grade serous epithelial ovarian carcinomas.|$|R
40|$|Interleukin 18 (IL- 18) is an {{inflammatory}} cytokine produced mainly by monocytes/macrophages {{in response to}} microbial stimuli {{and is able to}} induce IFN-γ in Th 1 and NK cells. IL- 18 is present at increased levels in serum and in organs in patients with autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s <b>disease,</b> <b>Sjögren</b> syndrome, psoriasis and systemic lupus erithematosus), and it has been reported to correlate with disease activity. This suggests that this factor may have a pathological role in autoimmunity. However, it is unknown if IL- 18 has a pathogenic role in autoimmune derangements, or if its increase is a consequence of the disorder. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify possible alterations in the expression of different molecules involved in the production and activity of IL- 18, in order to better understand the role of IL- 18 in autoimmune pathologies, and to clarify the molecular basis for enhanced IL- 18 function in autoimmunity. The study was performed in a murine model of chronic progressive autoimmune syndrome, the MRL lpr/lpr mice. The lpr mutation is a null allele for fas, a member of the TNF family of receptors that signals for death of the immune system. Mice are born disease-free and exhibit the first autoimmune symptoms at 9 - 12 weeks of age. Thus, the murine model offers the possibility to follow the pathology throughout its progression. The gene expression levels were assessed for IL- 18 and other molecules correlated to its production and signalling pathways: IL- 18 BP (natural inhibitor of IL- 18), the two IL- 18 receptor chains (IL- 18 Rα and IL- 18 Rβ), the inhibitory receptor TIR 8 /SIGIRR. It was also analysed the expression level of another cytokine of IL- 1 family, IL- 33, as well as of its receptor T 1 /ST 2, its accessory protein IL- 1 RAcP and the orphan receptor TIGIRR- 1. mRNA was extracted from various organs of mice between 5 and 26 weeks of age, and gene expression was measured by Real-Time PCR. Moreover, the concentration of free IL- 18 was assessed by ELISA assays for IL- 18 and IL- 18 BP. Preliminary data suggest that it is possible hypothesize a role for IL- 18 in the organ-specific autoimmune pathogenesis, limited to the primary organ targets (such as lymph nodes). On the other hand, in organs that are affected at later stages in end-organ disease (such as lung or kidney) increased IL- 18 correlates with disease severity and might be considered as a consequence of the de-regulated production of inflammatory cytokines caused by autoimmune alterations...|$|R
40|$|The {{main and}} most {{critical}} {{function of the}} immune system is to distinguish between self and non-self and react accordingly. Differentiating self-reactive immune cells as soon as they develop is the phenomenon of tolerance against self-antigens and is a highly regulated process. The development of autoantibodies is a sign of the breakdown of tolerance and may be the harbinger of the onset of an autoimmune disease. It is well-known fact that many systemic autoimmune diseases (AUIDs) first manifest in the oral cavity. If proven that oral infections trigger AUIDs, then improving oral health may be a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce autoimmune disease incidence. Although etiology and pathogenesis of specific AUIDs may vary, presentation in the oral cavity often involves oral lesions manifested at early stages of systemic inflammatory and autoimmune disease. Therefore regular dental and medical checkups may provide an opportunity for clinicians, in particular dentists, to contribute to earlier detection of AUIDs thereby improving long-term treatment options and overall patient prognosis. Mechanisms leading to the onset of autoimmune disease are still being considered. Epidemiological inquires and the increasing numbers of genome-wide association studies have analyzed the breakdown of tolerance and the causes behind autoimmunity. The role of the environment is crucial in the onset of autoimmunity via the breakdown of tolerance; through toll-like receptors that mediate innate immunity which in turn triggers the adaptive autoimmune response, T regulatory cells and Th 17 differentiation, through changes in the spleen autoantibody production due to a change in the B cell count, and through self antigen and epigenetic deviations induced by environmental spurs. In spite of many research efforts and the accumulation of innovative data, there are still multiple gaps in knowledge pertaining to this subject matter. The autoimmune process begins with the activation of Tcells by antigen presenting cells (APC) and progresses to CD 4 + CD 25 + Tcells and forkhead box P 3 (Foxp 3), which stimulate Th 1 and Th 2 responses and finally B cell activation, which plays a role in autoimmune development. This paper will review the etiopathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and different cell players as well as transcription factors such as TGF–β, IL– 6, IL– 10, IL– 17, Th– 17, T reg cells, B reg cells, Th– 1, Th– 2, and INF–γ. This paper aims to review published evidence and further explore the etiopathology of individual autoimmune diseases such as Behcet's, Crohn's <b>disease,</b> <b>Sjögren</b> syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis and the subsequent dental implications and therapeutic management. This review also aims to study the most relevant autoimmune, auto-inflammatory, and systemic chronic inflammatory diseases, as well as mechanisms of autoimmune manifestation with respect to oral health...|$|R
40|$|The {{marginal}} zone (MZ) is {{a distinct}} micro-anatomic compartment of the B-follicle, well developed in those secondary lymphoid organs where an abundant influx of antigens is known to occur (spleen, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and the mesenteric lymph nodes. The MZ comprises a particular subset of lymphoid cells indicated as MZ B-cells, which play {{an essential role in}} the rapid humoral immune response to T-cell-independent antigens, such as polysaccharides of encapsulated bacteria (Hemophilus influenza, Neisseria Meningitidis en Streptococcus pneumoniae). The latter is possible because of the capacity of MZ B-cells to rapidly proliferate upon antigen encounter and differentiate into short-living plasma-cells, which are responsible for the rapid release of low-affinity IgM antibodies and thus first-line defence against the pathogen. As such, until the age of 2 years, when the MZ is finally known to be fully developed, infants remain susceptible to infections with capsulated bacteria. Also, splenectomized individuals are notoriously susceptible to infections with these bacteria. MZ lymphomas (MZL) represent a group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas related to the MZ. They are morphologically marked by the presence of lympho-epithelial lesions as well as the presence of reactive B-follicles located within the neoplastic proliferation. Dependent upon their location, MZL are subdivided into 3 entities by the WHO: splenic MZL, nodal MZL lymphoma and extranodal MZL (or MALT lymphoma). Whether these 3 MZL represent 3 variants of one and the same disease or whether they represent 3 distinct clinico-pathological entities is still a matter of debate. Growing evidence indicates that MZL are associated with chronic inflammation, such a bacterial infections (Helicobacter pylori, Borrelia burgdorferi, Campylobacter jejuni, Chlamydia psittaci), viral infections (Hepatis C), or autoimmune <b>disease</b> (<b>Sjögren</b> syndrome, Hashimoto thyroiditis). The evolution from a reactive, polyclonal to a malignant, monoclonal B-cell population is related to the occurrence of genetic aberrations, which make the lymphoproliferation independent of antigenic stimulation. Although the stomach, lung, salivary and lachrymal glands are the most common site of involvement, MALT lymphomas may be encountered in virtually every organ of the human body. In 10 up to 50 %, the gastric MALT lymphoma is associated with the genetic aberration t(11; 18) (q 21;q 21). The latter juxtaposes the API 2 gene (11 q 21) next to the MALT 1 gene (18 q 21), resulting in the expression of an abnormal API 2 -MALT 1 fusion protein. The API 2 -MALT 1 fusion-transcript will always comprise the N-terminal API 2 region with three intact BIR (baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat) domains and the C-terminal MALT 1 region containing an intact caspase-like domain. This translocation is less frequently observed in non-gastric MALT lymphomas. Other MALT lymphoma-related translocations are t(1; 14) (p 22;q 32) and t(14; 18) (q 32;q 32), thereby bringing BCL 10 and MALT 1 respectively under control of the IGH-gene enhancer, resulting in a massive BCL 10 and MALT 1 overexpression. The precise role of the API 2 -MALT 1 fusion protein as well as the role of BCL 10 and MALT 1 overexpression in the pathogenesis of MALT lymphomas is not yet fully understood.
