Similarly, streaklines cannot intersect themselves or other streaklines, because two particles cannot be present at the same location at the <b>same</b> <b>instant</b> of time; unless the origin point {{of one of the}} streaklines also belongs to the streakline of the other origin point. However, pathlines are allowed to intersect themselves or other pathlines (except the starting and end points of the different pathlines, which need to be distinct).|$|E

25|$|In March 1926, {{working in}} Bohr's institute, Heisenberg {{realized}} that the non-commutativity implies the uncertainty principle. This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non-commutativity, and it {{laid the foundation for}} {{what became known as the}} Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty, or in Bohr's language a complementarity. Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously—the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known. Heisenberg wrote:It can be expressed in its simplest form as follows: One can never know with perfect accuracy both of those two important factors which determine the movement of one of the smallest particles—its position and its velocity. It is impossible to determine accurately both the position and the direction and speed of a particle at the <b>same</b> <b>instant.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the high}} and windy summit of Mount Suribachi, Rosenthal {{discovered}} a group of Marines attaching a large flag to a length of steel pipe.

Another group of Marines was getting themselves ready to lower the smaller flag at the <b>same</b> <b>instant</b> the larger flag was raised under an officer's orders. Rosenthal briefly contemplated attempting to photograph both of the flags at once, but was not in position to get both flags in the photograph (Pvt.

25|$|Adding {{a second}} serial {{line to the}} device, and adding another {{latching}} region would allow for the latching of two input values at the two different outputs. To perform computation, a gate that takes as inputs both serial lines at their respective outputs is added. The gate is placed over a new latching region configured to process data only when both latching regions {{at the end of}} the serial lines hold the values of interest at the <b>same</b> <b>instant.</b> Figure 10 shows such an arrangement. If correctly configured, latching regions 5 and 6 will each hold input values of interest to latching region 7. At this instant, latching region 7 will let the values latched on regions 5 and 6 through the AND gate, thus the output could be configured to be the AND result of any two inputs (i.e. R and Q) by merely configuring the latching regions 5, 6 and 7.|$|E
25|$|The coxswain {{would then}} call, 'Boat manned,' to the {{telephone}} operator at the loading station, who, in turn, reported to the 'LC' Control Room. The coxswain would then warn the troops to mind the pulleys {{at the ends of}} falls fore and aft, which could wave freely about when the craft had been set in the water. The task of hooking on and casting off from the ship required skill and seamanship from the coxswain, bowman, and sternsheetsman. The snatch blocks used were heavy steel and difficult to handle. The bowman and sternsheetsman stood by his respective block, as the craft was lowered into the water. At a time when there was sufficient slack in the falls both had to cast off at the <b>same</b> <b>instant,</b> and the blocks had to be released while there was slack in the falls. If the boat was not freed at both ends at once {{the rise and fall of}} the sea could cause the boat to tip, swamp, and perhaps capsize with loss of life. Casting-off was done in all sorts of sea conditions, and the sea might be rising and falling a metre or more (6' swells were not uncommon on D-Day). A combination of skill and luck could redeem a failure to cast-off, nevertheless. On D-Day, an LCA of Royal Marine 535 Flotilla, LSI Glenearn, released all but its after falls, which were jammed, and the craft tilted alarmingly to 45 degrees. The coxswain kept his head, calming the passengers, while seamen worked to free the falls. Once free, the coxswain need to get the LCA away to prevent colliding with the towering side of the LSI as it rose and fell with the swells.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Complicated {{mathematical}} {{models are}} usually used for processing {{measurements of the}} Earth magnetic field carried out onboard an Earth artificial satellite. It is desirable to verify the measurement data by humble tools before such processing. If a few onboard magnetometers made their measurements at the <b>same</b> <b>instants,</b> then one ought to check a simple geometrical compatibility of the measurement data. One can estimate constant shifts in the data and transition matrices between proper coordinate systems for each pair of magnetometers in case the check proved to be successful. Bellow, we described the method for checking the compatibility of the measurement data produced by two magnetometers. We illustrate the method by checking the compatibility of the magnetic measurements produced by the equipment Mirage onboard Foton M- 2. Note: Publication language:russia...|$|R

"When I {{presented}} my {{results at}} a meeting of the American Physical Society in 1923," [...] Compton later recalled, [...] "it initiated the most hotly contested scientific controversy that I have ever known." [...] The wave nature of light had been well demonstrated, and the idea that it could have a dual nature was not easily accepted. It was particularly telling that diffraction in a crystal lattice could only be explained with reference to its wave nature. It earned Compton the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927. Compton and Alfred W. Simon developed the method for observing at the <b>same</b> <b>instant</b> individual scattered X-ray photons and the recoil electrons.

Mass saw Villeneuve approaching at high speed {{and moved to the}} right to let him through on the racing line. At the <b>same</b> <b>instant</b> Villeneuve also moved right to pass the slower car. The Ferrari hit the back of Mass' car and [...] was launched into the air at a speed estimated at 200–225km/h (120–140mph). It was airborne for more than 100m before nosediving into the ground and disintegrating as it somersaulted {{along the edge of the}} track. Villeneuve, still strapped to his seat, but without his helmet, was thrown a further 50m from the wreckage into the catch fencing on the outside edge of the Terlamenbocht corner.|$|E

40|$|More {{and more}} data mining {{algorithms}} {{are applied to}} {{a large number of}} long time series issued by many distributed sen-sors. The consequence of the huge volume of data is that data warehouses often contain asynchronous time series, i. e. the values have been sampled and are not anymore observed at the <b>same</b> <b>instants.</b> This is a problem when applying data min-ing algorithms to such asynchronous time series. The stan-dard way to solve this problem is to interpolate intermediate points. We present here two new interpolation approaches which take into account the knowledge of the integral of the time series between two points. The first approach is naive and uses the history of slope values. The second approach is stochastic and provides a confidence interval of interpolated values. The two methods have been assessed experimentally on a real dataset of electric power consumption time series issued from smart meters. 1...|$|R

As the French tanks approached, the Viet Minh drove the civilians out to clog up the entrance to the village, however as the Viet Minh retreated they were spotted through the civilians by the Moroccan infantry and killed by 13:00. During this battle, however, most of the Regiment 95 personnel who had been elsewhere managed to escape towards {{the southern end of the}} French encirclement. Leblanc had realized the intentions of Regiment 95's commander, and had requested one of the two reserve paratroop units to be deployed at the border between the network of temples and the dune-filled area in front of where Group D had originally landed. This paratroop unit, 2nd Battalion of the 1st Colonial Parachute Regiment, began to advance towards the canal at 10:45, 15 minutes before Group B entered Dong-Qué.|$|E
