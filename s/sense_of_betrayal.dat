He flew combat missions there until Germany surrendered in May. He remained with No. 130 Squadron {{for the rest of}} his service, and returned home at the end of 1945. After completing his studies at Rhodes, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly for his birthplace, Selukwe, in 1948. He became Prime Minister in 1964, during his country's dispute with Britain regarding the terms for independence; Smith was influenced as a politician by his wartime experiences, and Rhodesia's military record on behalf of Britain became central to his <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>betrayal</b> by post-war British governments. This partly motivated his administration's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965. His status as a Second World War RAF veteran helped him win support, both domestically and internationally.|$|E

Home on leave in 1917, he catches his wife Emily performing fellatio on his best friend and next-door neighbor, Bedford Cunningham, a crippled veteran. That, combined with the Confederacy's defeat that year, leaves him a bitter and vengeful man. Although his wife betrayed him with a white man, in his mind the deep <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>betrayal</b> by her seems to blend with the widespread feeling in the surrounding society that the Confederacy had been [...] "betrayed" [...] by the black rebels who [...] "stabbed it in the back" [...] and caused its defeat.|$|R

[...] The controversy surrounding the differences in contributions to Afghanistan indeed remained after the summit.

500|$|After German reunification, Mühe {{allegedly}} discovered {{evidence in}} his Stasi file {{that he had}} been under surveillance not only by four of his fellow actors in the East Berlin theatre, but also by his wife Gröllmann. The file held detailed records of meetings that Gröllmann, who was registered as an [...] "Inoffizieller Mitarbeiter" [...] (unofficial collaborator), had with her controller from 1979 to 1989. This mirrored the plot of Das Leben der Anderen as in the film pressure exerted by the Stasi on the playwright's girlfriend makes her betray him as the author of an exposé of covered-up GDR suicide rates. Mühe and Gröllmann divorced in 1990. In a book accompanying the film, Mühe spoke about the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>betrayal</b> he felt when he found out about his former wife's alleged Stasi role. However, Gröllmann's real-life controller later claimed he had made up many of the details in the file and that the actress had been unaware that she was speaking to a Stasi agent. After a highly public and acrimonious battle in the courts, Gröllmann, who died in August 2006, won an injunction preventing the book's publication.

The wartime plastic surgery that corrected the wounds to his face left its right side paralysed, giving him a crooked smile and a somewhat blank expression, while his bodily injuries gave him a stoop and a slight limp; he also could not sit for long periods without pain. The post-colonial UK Smith encountered as Prime Minister seemed to him [...] "foreign and somewhat effete", to quote Kenneth Young, while Smith was [...] "a foreigner in all but language to most British politicians—a man of convictions so outdated, of tastes so naive, as to make mutual understanding almost impossible." [...] Smith held most of the British politicians he dealt with in extremely low esteem, considering them to have pushed him and his country into an impossible position where, he asserted in 1970, the decision to take unilateral action was [...] "forced upon us".|$|R

500|$|In {{the main}} event, {{the team of}} the All-Americans, which {{consisted}} of Lex Luger, Tatanka, and the Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott Steiner) faced the Foreign Fanatics, which consisted of Yokozuna, Ludvig Borga, and The Quebecers (Jacques and Pierre). The main storyline behind the match began that summer when Yokozuna, a Japanese sumo wrestler, challenged any American athlete to bodyslam him {{on the deck of}} the USS Intrepid during an event on Independence Day. After several challengers were unable to lift Yokozuna, Luger arrived via helicopter and successfully performed what was termed [...] "the bodyslam heard around the world". Luger was granted a match for Yokozuna's WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam. Luger got a victory via countout but did not win the title. In the dressing room after the match, Borga, a Finnish wrestler, interrupted Luger's celebration by criticizing Luger and initiating a new feud. The Steiner Brothers spent the fall 1993 feuding with The Quebecers, a Canadian tag team. They had faced each other several times since The Quebecers had won the WWF Tag Team Championship from the Steiners on September 13. Since arriving in the WWF, Tatanka had been on a two-year winning streak. Borga ended the streak on the October 30, 1993 episode of WWF Superstars by pinning Tatanka after hitting him with a chair. After the match, Borga and Yokozuna attacked Tatanka, causing kayfabe injuries that forced Tatanka to withdraw from the match at Survivor Series. The All-Americans recruited The Undertaker to replace Tatanka. On the November 15 episode of Monday Night Raw, Luger defeated Pierre; as a result of a kayfabe injury in the match, the Foreign Fanatics had to replace Pierre with Crush, the sole American of the team. Crush was feuding with Randy Savage going into the event. They had been on-screen friends, but Crush was angry that Savage had not saved him from an attack by Yokozuna on the July 12, 1993 episode of Monday Night Raw. To make his injuries seem real, Crush did not appear on WWF television programming for several months. He made his return on October 18, accompanied by Yokozuna's manager, Mr. Fuji, claiming that they sympathized with Crush's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>betrayal</b> by Savage. Savage tried to make amends with Crush, who then attacked Savage and announced that he had turned against Savage and the United States and was aligning himself with Yokozuna, Fuji, and Japan.|$|E

Mind you, the general {{impression}} which the viewer leaves the theatre with, {{is that of the}} Bolsheviks' victory. [...] "That the likes of the Turbins decide to lay down the arms and succumb to the will of the people, conceding the defeat, could mean only one thing: that the Bolsheviks are invincible." [...] Such a line of argument served as red herring for Stalin, the critic Marianna Shaternikova argued, for [...] "there was nothing in the play which might have been interpreted even as a hint at the Bolshevism's invincibility. What there was instead is the all-pervading <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> total <b>betrayal...</b> as the White Army generals, the Hetman, the Germans and all those whom they considered friends or allies, abandoning Turbins." [...] A small detail found in the diaries of Elena Bulgakova shows how deeply moved the Soviet leader had been by the play. [...] "You perform Alexey so good!

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{discover}} and describe the structure and essential meaning of the experience <b>of</b> <b>betrayal</b> in intimate relationships. Previous and current research has directed much attention to the consequences and effects <b>of</b> <b>betrayal</b> in relationships, however the essential experience of the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>betrayal</b> has received less attention. The experience <b>of</b> <b>betrayal</b> was approached from a Kleinian perspective. A review of the literature revealed that betrayal per se is less frequently found in psychological texts although extensive reference to the construct is found in the field of sociology, in texts on deviance (Ben-Yehuda, 2001). However, inherent aspects of the phenomenon may be recalled for the purposes of this study, notably trust and loyalty. Trust is considered to be an intrinsic variable in the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>betrayal.</b> Loyalty appears to be an interchangeable variable and is briefly included in this study. Trust as a significant aspect in the establishment of human relationships was discussed with reference to relevant psychological paradigms. The bridge to Kleinian theory was formed using trust as a fundamental aspect of the primary mother-infant relationship. Further exploration of core Kleinian constructs and Klein’s developmental positions, were also integrated in elucidating the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>betrayal</b> in intimate relationships. Being qualitative in nature, the experience <b>of</b> <b>betrayal</b> was explored using research principles of grounded theory (Strauss&Corbin, 1990 / 1998) for the purposes of data reduction, analysis and generation of theory. In addition, the qualitative research interview, proposed by Kvale (1996), was used to collect the data. In-depth interviews with five participants and a second interview with one of the participants were conducted. The participants were unknown to myself as the researcher, prior to commencing the study and they were formally approached by three fellow practising psychologists. Furthermore, the study of the experience <b>of</b> <b>betrayal</b> included verification <b>of</b> the transcribed interviews by the participants, prior to data reduction and analysis. In this manner, opportunities for further reflection and an enhanced understanding of the experience <b>of</b> <b>betrayal</b> were provided. The core category which emerges from this inquiry is a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> alienation which individuals experience as a result <b>of</b> <b>betrayal</b> in intimate relationships. Therefore, contrary to Klein’s extensive emphasis on intrapsychic processes, the interpersonal nature of individuals cannot be excluded or underestimated. These findings specifically contribute to Kleinian theory, social psychology, sociology, theology and psychotherapy. In this study the participants’ experience <b>of</b> <b>betrayal,</b> the consequences for the participants themselves and the outcome of the relationships were addressed. Furthermore, the significance of cognitive processes in adulthood and the theoretical implications of the relational phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>betrayal</b> for further research were mentioned. Contributions to Klein’s theory as well as a critical review of the research methodology and a critique of the strengths and limitations of this study were also included.
