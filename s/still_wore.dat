25|$|Many of the WAGN Class 317/1 units <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> the Network SouthEast (NSE) {{blue and}} red livery dating from 1986. In 2001, a new livery of {{metallic}} purple with lilac doors was introduced. The first unit so treated was 317 312, which had recently returned from loan to LTS Rail. The livery was progressively applied to the Class 317/1 fleet, with the final NSE examples (317 328 & 317 345) disappearing by mid-2004. By April 2004, the only units not repainted were 317301-307, which were hired to Thameslink and remained in LTS livery. The WAGN purple livery was also applied to Class 313 and Class 315 EMU trains.|$|E
25|$|Montgomery made a {{great effort}} to appear before troops as often as possible, {{frequently}} visiting various units and making himself known to the men, often arranging for cigarettes to be distributed. Although he <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> a standard British officer's cap on arrival in the desert, he briefly wore an Australian broad-brimmed hat before switching to wearing the black beret (with the badge of the Royal Tank Regiment next to the British General Officer's badge) for which he became notable. The black beret was offered to him by Jim Fraser while the latter was driving him on an inspection tour. Both Brooke and Alexander were astonished by the transformation in atmosphere when they visited on 19 August, {{less than a week}} after Montgomery had taken command.|$|E

25|$|British yeomanry {{were armed}} with a 1908 pattern sword, and Lee–Enfield rifles, unlike their French and German counterparts, who were only {{armed with a}} shorter range carbine. As the war progressed, they were issued with brodie helmets, hand grenades, trench mortars and Hotchkiss light machine guns.

500|$|British cavalry {{were armed}} with a 1908 pattern sword; lancers were {{armed with a}} [...] lance with a steel head mounted on an ash stave. Cavalrymen were also armed with Lee–Enfield rifles, unlike their French and German counterparts, who were only armed with a shorter range carbine. As the war progressed, the cavalrymen were issued with brodie helmets, hand grenades, trench mortars, and Hotchkiss light machine guns. The {{replacement}} of the Vickers Guns with the Hotchkiss, issued one per troop, greatly increased the firepower of the cavalry regiments. Like the infantry, cavalrymen were dressed in a khaki uniform, with a service dress cap. Instead of infantry webbing, they carried their ammunition in a bandolier.

500|$|During {{its first}} years, the daily Winnie Winkle evolved from simple gags to more complex humorous situations. A new {{character}} {{was introduced in}} the form of Perry, a little boy from the backstreets, whom the Winkles adopted in 1922. The focus of the Sunday pages then shifted to the adventures of Perry at home, school and on the streets. Although compelled to wear a duffle coat and fancy clothes, he continued to frequent his old neighborhood. The local gang, the Rinkydinks, in contrast, <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> torn and patchy clothing, and were regarded by Winnie as [...] "loafers." [...] One member of the Rinkydinks was the dunce, Denny Dimwit, who popularized the catch phrase, [...] "Youse is a good boy, Denny." ...|$|E

500|$|On 18 April, Kroonland {{began her}} next homeward journey, embarking several {{companies}} of the 111th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 28th Infantry Division among the 3,100 troops carried. Though {{the fighting was}} over, the men <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> life jackets {{for the first three}} days at sea amidst fears of striking floating mines. George W. Cooper, historian of the 2nd Battalion of the 111th Infantry, reported that some of the men had to serve as stokers during the trip because of a [...] "shortage of help". In the middle of the crossing, the ship [...] "sprung a leak" [...] and took on [...] of water; she had a list for a day or so, until repairs were made. The troops later disembarked at New York on 29 April.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the team}} arrived in Australia, Jardine quickly alienated the press {{by refusing to}} give team details before a match and being {{uncooperative}} when interviewed by journalists. The press printed some negative stories as a result and the crowds barracked as they had done on his previous tour, which made him angry. Jardine <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> his Harlequin cap and began the tour well with 98 and 127 before the first Test. Once again, he clashed with paceman Bill Bowes, refusing to give his bowler the requested field placings in an early match. As a result, Bowes deliberately gave away easy runs {{in an attempt to}} get his way, but following a discussion, Bowes was converted to Jardine's tactics and ultimately to his ability as a captain. In a tour match, Jardine also instructed Hammond to attack the bowling of Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, whom he considered dangerous and thus did not want him to play in the Tests. Up until this point, there had been little unusual about the English bowling except the number of fast bowlers. Larwood and Voce were given a light workload in the early matches by Jardine. This changed in the match against an Australian XI, from which Jardine rested himself, where the bowlers first used the tactics that {{came to be known as}} Bodyline. Under the captaincy of Wyatt, the bowlers bowled short and around leg stump, with fielders positioned close by on the leg side to catch any deflections. Wyatt later claimed that this was not planned beforehand and he simply passed on to Jardine what happened after the match. These tactics continued in the next match; several players were hit. Many commentators criticised this style of bowling; although bowlers had previously used leg theory bowling, where bowlers bowled outside leg stump with a concentration of fielders on the leg side, using these tactics with fast bowlers dropping the ball short was almost unprecedented. It was seen as dangerous and against the spirit of the game. In a letter, Jardine told Fender that his information about the Australian batting technique was correct and that it meant he was having to move more and more fielders onto the leg side. He said that [...] "if this goes on I shall have to move the whole bloody lot to the leg side." [...] Jardine increasingly came into disagreement with Warner over Bodyline as the tour progressed, but his tactics were successful in one respect: in six innings against the tourists ahead of the Tests, Bradman had scored only 103 runs, causing concern among the Australian public who expected much more from him.|$|E
2500|$|Added to the International Best Dressed List in 1961, Hepburn was {{associated}} with a minimalistic style, usually wearing clothes with simple silhouettes which emphasised her slim body, monochromatic colours, and occasional statement accessories. In the late 1950s, Audrey Hepburn popularized plain black leggings. Academic Rachel Moseley describes the combination of [...] "slim black trousers, flat ballet-style pumps and a fine black jersey" [...] as one of her signature looks alongside little black dresses, noting that this style was new at the time when women <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> skirts and high heels more often than trousers and flat shoes.|$|E

2500|$|Curiously, whereas Sam Redgate {{was viewed}} with {{trepidation}} {{in terms of}} his pace, he was very much a reactionary in fashion terms. [...] Among professionals in the 1830s, he was said to be the last to discard breeches in favour of trousers. [...] Trousers have existed since ancient times but never became fashionable until the sans-culottes of the French Revolution. [...] In England, they began to replace breeches during the Napoleonic War and were widely in use by 1815. [...] Redgate was not alone in his preference for breeches: the Eton and Harrow teams <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> them in 1830.|$|E
2500|$|In 1914 most French {{soldiers}} wore their kepis to war. The {{highly visible}} colours were hidden by a medium blue-grey cover, following {{the example of}} the Foreign Legion and other North African units who had long worn their kepis with white (or later khaki) covers in the field. With the adoption of [...] "horizon blue" [...] (light blue-grey) uniforms and steel Adrian helmets in 1915 to replace the conspicuous peace time uniforms worn during the early months of war, the kepi was generally replaced by folding forage caps. Officers, however, <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> kepis behind the lines.|$|E
2500|$|Chinese fashion {{had a huge}} {{influence}} on Japan from the Kofun period to the early Heian period {{as a result of}} mass immigration from the continent and a Japanese envoy to the Tang Dynasty. During Japan's Heian period (794–1192 AD), the kimono became increasingly stylized, though one <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> a half-apron, called a mo, over it. During the Muromachi age (1392–1573 AD), the Kosode, a single kimono formerly considered underwear, began to be worn without the hakama (trousers, divided skirt) over it, and thus began to be held closed by an obi [...] "belt". During the Edo period (1603–1867 AD), the sleeves began to grow in length, especially among unmarried women, and the Obi became wider, with various styles of tying coming into fashion. Since then, the basic shape of both the men’s and women’s kimono has remained essentially unchanged. Kimonos made with exceptional skill from fine materials have been regarded as great works of art.|$|E

2500|$|Feld also {{introduced}} multiple new variants on Wonder Woman's uniform beginning in season two. She <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> the red-white-and-blue cape for special events or appearances {{from the first}} season, but without the skirt. (This variant {{could be described as}} Wonder Woman's [...] "full-dress uniform.") A diving uniform was introduced—this consisted of a navy-blue lycra body suit with matching gloves, gold bracelets, flat boots, and a flexible tiara; this was featured whenever aquatic activity was required. The same uniform, with low-heeled boots and a gold helmet, was used to ride motorcycles. At first, Wonder Woman would switch to these newer uniforms by performing an extended spin in which she first changed from her Diana Prince clothes to Wonder Woman's standard uniform, then continued to spin until a second light explosion occurred and she would appear in one of the newer variants. However, this extended spin device was dropped for expediency and Diana was then able to change into any of Wonder Woman's uniforms in a single change.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fashion of}} the Gibson Girl allowed them {{a much more}} active {{lifestyle}} then previously, in both work and recreation. [...] "Skirts were long and flared, and dresses were tailored with high necks and close-fitting sleeves. The style was considered masculine, and this was sometimes emphasized by wearing a necktie. Though women <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> the restrictive undergarments known as corsets, a new health corset came into style that {{was said to be}} better for the spine than earlier corsets. An S-shaped figure became trendy, with a large bust and large hips, separated by a tiny, corseted waist. These styles, worn with confidence and poise by modern women. ... She might be pictured at a desk in a tailored shirtwaist or at a tennis party in an informal sports dress. She wore her long hair upswept in an elaborate mass of curls, perhaps topped by a simple straw hat. Though she was capable and independent, the Gibson girl was always beautiful and elegant." [...] According to the Library of Congress, [...] "Gibson’s meticulous depiction of their hats accentuates the Gibson Girls' stylish attire and visually reinforces the impression of height, leading the eye to the mountains. ... Gibson shows off the classic Gibson Girl as a figure who embraced outdoor physical activities." ...|$|E
2500|$|His second trip, in {{the autumn}} of the same year, took him east along the Trans-Siberian Railway. Although he disembarked without warning at Novosibirsk, he {{acquired}} an NKVD escort. He travelled on the Turksib Railway south to Biisk (Biysk), {{at the foot of the}} Altai Mountains, and then to Altaisk and Barnaul. On the trains he heard the complaints of the Siberian kolkhozniks (workers on collective farms) and witnessed another mass movement, this time of Koreans to Central Asia. His first main destination was Alma Ata (Almaty), the capital of the Kazakh republic, which lies near to the Tien Shan Mountains. He characterised it as [...] "one of the pleasantest provincial towns in the Soviet Union" [...] and particularly appreciated the apples for which it is famous. [...] From there he took a truck to a hill village called Talgar and went walking with one of his NKVD escorts; Maclean availed himself of peasant hospitality and commented on the general prosperity. [...] He managed to hire a car and made it to Issyk-kul, the lake that never freezes, but had to turn back because of the season. [...] From Alma Ata Maclean took the train for Tashkent, passing through villages where [...] "nothing seemed to have changed since the time when the country was ruled over by the Emir of Bokhara"; men still rode bulls and women <b>still</b> <b>wore</b> veils made of black horsehair. [...] From Tashkent, which then had a reputation for wickedness, he made the final leg to the fabled city of Samarkand. He returned to Moscow with plans for a further trip.|$|E
