500|$|On September 11, 1970, Hendrix {{gave his}} final {{interview}} in his suite at the Cumberland Hotel in London, where he talked with Keith Altham, a journalist for Record Mirror. During the interview, Hendrix confirmed reports that Billy Cox, the bass player in his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, was leaving. Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of paranoia, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: [...] "Do you feel any kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar", Hendrix replied: [...] "No, I don't even let that bother me. Because they <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things about people that, if they let it bother them, they wouldn't even be around today... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy." [...] Altham also suggested that Hendrix invented psychedelic music, to which he laughed and replied: [...] "A mad scientist approach... I don't consider [...] the invention of psychedelic, it's just asking a lot of questions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{released}} {{one more}} album with Columbia Records in 1988. It was released {{under the name}} Hide Your Heart in Europe, and Notes From America in the United States. Prolific songwriters for the album included Michael Bolton, Albert Hammond and Desmond Child, who also produced the album. The album enjoyed some success in continental Europe, but only peaked at No. 78 in the UK and failed to chart in the United States. The singles from Hide Your Heart were minor hits for Tyler, but went on to be major hits for other artists, including Kiss (with [...] "Hide Your Heart"), Robin Beck, Cher and Freda Payne (with [...] "Save Up All Your Tears") and Tina Turner with [...] "The Best". When looking back over this era, Desmond Child said:Bonnie Tyler {{is one of the}} greatest singers on Earth. Why? Because she comes to the studio prepared. I've never even seen her use a lyric sheet to sing. She comes with the song memorized, so when she stands there and sings, she closes her eyes. She's in a sacred space and you feel that. You can <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things about Bonnie Tyler, but you cannot say she does not feel her music.|$|E
2500|$|Albini's lyrics drew {{criticism}} for apparent racism and homophobia. Racism {{was a frequent}} theme in Big Black songs, influenced partly by the sharp racial divisions present in Chicago at the time. The word [...] "darkie" [...] appeared in {{the first line of}} the Lungs EP, but Albini defended its use as a comical term, saying [...] "in a way that's a play on the concept of a hateful word. Can a word that's so inherently hilarious be hateful? I don't know." [...] He similarly defended his use of gay jokes and the word [...] "fag": [...] "Given how intermingled the gay and punk subcultures were, it was assumed by anyone involved that open-mindedness, if not free-form experimentation, was the norm. With that assumption under your belt, joke all you like. The word 'fag' isn't just a gay term, it's funny on its own — phonetically — like the words 'hockey puck,' 'mukluks,' 'gefilte fish,' and 'Canada. Some critics viewed these defenses as mere justifications for actual deep-seated racism, homophobia, and misogyny on Albini's part, given his level of familiarity with the subject matter, but he insisted that he was not a prejudiced person and was merely satirizing those impulses that rational, civilized persons normally suppress in the course of social interaction: [...] "So once that's given, once you know what you think, there's no reason to be ginger about what you <b>say.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people, they're very careful not to say things that might offend certain people or do anything that might be misinterpreted. But what they don't realize is that the point of all this is to change the way you live your life, not the way you speak." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stanley is Eddie's next-door neighbor, who {{is obsessed}} with Raven. He serves as the primary {{antagonist}} of the show, he has a frenemy relationship with Eddie and Cory, although he is usually seen scamming them. Stanley was originally brought in as a love interest for Raven's next-door neighbor, Sierra, but he becomes {{much more interested in}} Raven, and in one episode, Loka. Stanley is rude, obnoxious, mean, sarcastic, and deceptive to everyone. He is a young salesman, who usually tricks Cory into buying something that would eventually go wrong. Stanley is always trying desperately to get Raven to like him, but he suddenly leaves her alone after seeing her kiss Andre in the episode [...] "Mr. Perfect". He loves to eat cheese sandwiches. He also competes against Chelsea in a ping-pong match, and loses. In the same episode ("Taken to the Cleaners"), he asks Victor to make him a cheese sandwich {{in the shape of a}} ping-pong paddle. His catchphrases include [...] "My brotha!", which he exclaims whenever he is trying to [...] "show someone up"; and [...] "I may have said that, but I <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things." [...] This is a partial denial of his ability to be nice to other people. He appears primarily in Seasons 3 and 4, in the episodes [...] "Opportunity Shocks"; [...] "Taken to the Cleaners"; [...] "The Grill Next Door"; [...] "Mr. Perfect"; [...] "The Four Aces"; [...] "Driving Miss Lazy"; [...] "Sister Act"; [...] "Checkin' Out"; [...] "Fur Better or Worse" [...] and [...] "When 6021 Met 4267". He also appeared in the Cory in the House episode [...] "Uninvited Pest" [...] when he covets the Presidential medal Cory was going to receive for his Young Businessperson of the Year project. He got into the [...] "Up with Goodness" [...] program, feigned an ankle injury, and stole Cory's presentation. It is also noted that he has a fear of bones, which helps Cory prove that Stanley faked the injury and stole his presentation.|$|E

[...] He approved himself with a chuckle. [...] "Have you ever found anyone seriously ill without doctors and medicine about? Never!

She has a keen eye for the everyday, mundane aspects of English life, especially the desires, frustrations, hopes, confusions and emotions in intimate relationships. Dr Rowan Williams is a well known fan of her work, writing that: [...] "Wendy Cope is without doubt the wittiest of contemporary English poets, and <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> extremely serious things".|$|R

Everything can't always be my fault, can it? And now if I get to fussing, he just turns silent, oh, so dreadfully silent, and he won't look at me--he just ignores me. He simply isn't human!

Quite contrary to the usual theory about scores, one of the things I like about his scores is that I can always hear his voice in there. As much as they complement the movie, or serve the movie, they are still uniquely Ry. Ry surrounds a movie and plays through the atmosphere. I like that." ...|$|E

In early January, Republican primary frontrunner Donald Trump suggested that Clinton's past infidelities could harm his wife's campaign, Clinton afterward dismissing him: [...] "Donald Trump <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things". On March 21, Clinton made comments about putting [...] "the awful legacy of the last eight years behind us", leading to speculation that he was negatively referring to the Obama presidency.

It's {{not a political}} album, it's a personal album.
