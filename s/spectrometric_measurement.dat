50|$|The destaining {{solution}} for CBB contains usually the buffer salt ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) and {{a fraction of}} 30%-50% organic solvent (mostly acetonitrile). The hydrophobic interactions between protein and CBB are reduced by the organic fraction of the solution. At the same time, the ionic {{part of the solution}} diminishes the electrostatic bonds between the dye and the positively charged amino acids of the protein. In contrast to a mixture of water with organic solvent the effectivity of destaining is increased. An increase of temperature promotes the destaining process. To a certain degree (< 10%) the destaining procedure is accompanied with a loss of protein. Furthermore, the removal of CBB does not affect the yield of peptides in the mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>measurement.</b>|$|E

40|$|Classical {{quantitative}} proteomics studies {{focus on}} the relative or absolute concentration of proteins at a given time. In contrast, the investigation of protein turnover reveals the dynamics leading to these states. Analyzing the balance between synthesis and degradation of individual proteins provides insights into the regulation of protein concentration and helps understanding underlying biological processes. Comparing the half-lives of proteins allows detecting functional relationships and common regulation mechanisms. Moreover, comparing turnover of individual brain and plasma proteins between control- and treatment-groups indicates turnover changes induced by the treatment. Here, we describe a procedure for determining turnover information of individual proteins in mice on a proteome-wide scale based on partial N- 15 metabolic labeling.

The <b>spectrometric</b> <b>measurement</b> of the electrochromic shift of these pigments is determined {{as a function of}} the composition of the external medium. The treatment relies further on the appropriate choice of an ideally specific ionophore used to shunt the membrane electrically and on the introduction of one divalent and one monovalent reference ion which have negligible effects on complexation of the surface sites. The results prove the applicability of the Poisson-Boltzman treatment for surface charge density and surface potential derivation.
