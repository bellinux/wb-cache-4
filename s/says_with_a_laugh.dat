'It's the details and the backdrop, {{and a lot of the}} {{perspective}} of this kid and the way that he looks at the world,' explains Levine. 'The Stephanie character, I guess, is a composite of a few different ladies who broke up with me,' Levine <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh.</b> 'That happened.'" ...|$|E

[...] "She had the painting hanging in her Chelsea studio, and I found myself returning {{to it when}} I went in to see her new work. It's called 'Toxic Walk in the Park.' I don't know what the figures are doing, what they're walking away from, or towards.

I've got it all as far as I'm concerned." [...] Still, he hasn't quite shaken the acting bug. According to People, Hewitt learned of an {{industry}} ad asking if anyone knew where he was. Some filmmakers, it turned out, thought he would be perfect for a lead role in a movie about drugged-out gay prostitutes in West Hollywood. [...] "It wasn't for me", he <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh.</b> [...] "I politely declined." ...|$|E

[...] Brewster said of moving on from Criminal Minds, [...] "... last year I decided that I wanted to {{challenge}} myself, and doing these episodes of Law & Order: SVU has proven me right." [...] Brewster noted of her character, BC ADA Foster, [...] "I'm despised by the detectives," [...] she <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> adding [...] "I've been able to work with everybody, but especially with Mariska Hargitay!"

[...] "I just hope both shows get great ratings!" ...|$|E
5000|$|A singer-songwriter who accompanies {{himself on}} piano, James began writing {{the songs on}} his second album after winding up {{a year and a}} half on the road in support of his debut album The Day Is Brave, which was {{released}} by Decca Records in June 2008 and debuted in the Top 10 on Billboard’s Heatseekers chart. Several of its songs were featured on various television shows including Private Practice, Bones, So You Think You Can Dance, and Army Wives. After releasing the album, James hit the ground running to support it from coast to coast. [...] "I went to 40 states, ate at 330 restaurants, stayed in 210 hotels, and slept on one boat - John Mayer’s Mayercraft Cruise; I know because I wrote it all down," [...] James <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh.</b> The 18-month tour enabled James (whom Entertainment Weekly has called [...] "A Songwriter on the Rise") to build his fanbase the way many successful musicians have done before him: one room at a time, and he shares the fruits of that journey - renewed vigor, musical maturity, and even a new sound - on his second album.|$|E
5000|$|In 1967, Gibb was in The Speakeasy Club, {{a nightclub}} in London {{where he was}} {{introduced}} by Pete Townshend to John Lennon. Lennon was still wearing his outfit for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band photo shoot earlier that day on 30 March 1967; {{after a couple of}} scotch and cokes, Townshend said to Gibb, [...] "Do you want to meet John?" [...] and he led Gibb across to a room where Lennon was holding court and Townshend said, [...] "John. This is Barry Gibb, from the group the Bee Gees" [...] to which Lennon replied, [...] "Howyadoin'"."So I met John Lennon's back", Gibb <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> [...] "I didn't meet his front". Gibb earlier said in 2010 about the meeting, [...] "It was virtually a closed club and you went downstairs and there was a coffin and if you were someone they knew and you were supposed to go in, the wall would turn around... and in you would go. There would be Rolling Stones lying around all over the place. It was one of those days when I met John Lennon - from the back. It was Pete Townshend who introduced me... said, 'Pleased to meet you', and he carried on talking to his guest." ...|$|E

6000|$|Just then Jamie came back, and Rose {{understood}} the smile, for his dolly {{proved to be}} a pretty four-year-old little girl, who trotted in as fast as her fat legs would carry her, and making straight for the shells, scrambled up <b>an</b> armful, <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh</b> that showed her little white teeth, ...|$|R
6000|$|Bertrand du Guesclin, {{who stood}} among the throng of nobles around the Prince, {{was the first}} to come forward and shake Eustace by the hand, <b>saying</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> [...] "Nay, my Lord, {{this is the first time}} the ugliest Knight in France has been called by such a name.

6000|$|The {{sight of}} the childish harvest, treasured through all the {{troubles}} of that night for her, seemed to touch Mrs. Jo to the heart, for suddenly she gathered up her boy, {{and began to cry}} over him, so tenderly, yet so heartily, that he woke up, and at first seemed bewildered.

6000|$|A daring fancy {{to try the}} {{experiment}} took possession of the boy as {{he sat on the}} topmost rail with the glossy back temptingly near him. Never thinking of danger, he obeyed the impulse, and while Charlie unsuspectingly nibbled at the apple he held, Dan quickly and quietly took his seat. He did not keep it long, however, for <b>with</b> <b>an</b> astonished snort, Charlie reared straight up, and deposited Dan on the ground. The fall did not hurt him, for the turf was soft, and he jumped up, <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{penitent}} boys poured forth apologies, {{in which}} fire, remorse, and breakfast were oddly mixed. Bobby forgave them like <b>a</b> gentleman, only <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh</b> and <b>a</b> shiver, [...] "Guess I'd better go home, ma'll {{be worried about}} me. If I'd known being out all night and getting wet {{was part of the}} business, I'd 'a' left word and brought a blanket. Be I a Round Table now? Shall I have a sword, and train with the rest?

6000|$|... "Poor Tom, what a fate!" [...] said Polly {{with what}} {{was meant to be}} a comical groan; but it sounded so tragical that she saw it would n't pass, and hastened to hide the failure by <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> [...] "If you call Trix passe at twenty-three, what shall we all be at twenty-five?" [...] "Utterly done with, and laid upon the shelf.

60|$|The {{lieutenant}} {{was in the}} act of replying to this <b>saying</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cheerful <b>laugh,</b> {{when the}} whistling of a passing shot was instantly succeeded by a crash of splintered wood; and at the next moment the head of the mainmast, after tottering for an instant in the gale, fell towards the deck, bringing with it the mainsail, and the long line of topmast, that had been bearing the emblems of America, as the cockswain had expressed it, among the stars of the heavens.|$|R

5000|$|At age 72, {{just after}} the {{publication}} of his second short-story collection Fun With Problems, Stone admitted (during a newspaper interview) that he suffered from severe emphysema: [...] "It's my punishment for chain-smoking," [...] he <b>says.</b> But <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wry <b>laugh,</b> he recalls his reaction to being told of the harm smoking could cause him in old age: [...] "I'm not going to know I'm alive!".|$|R
6000|$|Nothing {{seemed to}} vex Mr. Vere more than when strangers {{indicated}} any {{observation of the}} state of tutelage under which he appeared to labour. When it was noticed by Sir Frederick, or any of his intimates, he sometimes repelled their remarks haughtily and indignantly, and sometimes endeavoured to evade them, by <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> forced <b>laugh,</b> [...] "That Ratcliffe knew his own importance, but that he was the most honest and skilful fellow in the world; {{and that it would be}} impossible for him to manage his English affairs without his advice and assistance."

His grace is the greatest gentleman in Europe, and I’ll try and make him happy; and, when the king comes back, you may count on my protection, Cousin Esmond—for come back the king will and shall: and I’ll bring him back from Versailles, if he comes under my hoop.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Yes, I was {{extraordinarily}} wretched that night. I {{was filled}} with self-contempt and self-disgust. I felt that I was utterly weak and vain, and all the pretensions and effort of my life mere florid, fruitless pretensions and nothing more. I had lost all control over my mind. Things that had seemed secondary before became primary, difficult things became impossible things. I had been greatly impeded and irritated in London by the manoeuvres {{of a number of}} people who were anxious to make capital out of the crisis, self-advertising people who wanted at any cost to be lifted into a position of unique protest.... You see, that unfortunate Nobel prize has turned the advocacy of peace into a highly speculative profession; the qualification for the winner is so vaguely defined that a vast multitude of voluntary idealists has been created and a still greater number diverted from the unendowed pursuit of human welfare in other directions. Such a man as myself who is known to command a considerable publicity is necessarily a prey to those moral entrepreneurs. All sorts of ridiculous and petty incidents had forced this side of public effort upon me, but hitherto I had been able to <b>say,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh</b> or sigh as the case warranted, [...] "So much is dear old humanity and all of us"; and to remember the great residuum of nobility that remained. Now that last saving consideration refused to be credible. I lay with my body and my mind in pain thinking these people over, thinking myself over too with the rest of my associates, thinking drearily and weakly, recalling spites, dishonesties and vanities, feuds and absurdities, until I was near persuaded that all my dreams of wider human understandings, of great ends beyond the immediate aims and passions of common everyday lives, could be at best no more than the refuge of shy and weak and ineffective people from the failure of their personal lives....|$|R

60|$|Young persons who, scantily clad, go {{to sleep}} on the heather, five miles from the nearest human habitation, are to be avoided by well-brought-up young {{officers}} of His Majesty's Aerial Service. The incidence of their being uncannily beautiful and alluring should serve as an additional note of warning. The girl had had <b>a</b> row <b>with</b> her mother and wanted to get away. It was this infernal moonlight that was chiefly responsible. No wonder dogs bayed at it. He almost fancied he could hear one now. Nice, respectable, wholesome-minded things, dogs.

Not {{the first time she had}} been kissed, unless all the young men in Brittany were blind or white blooded. All this pretended innocence and simplicity! It was just put on.

6000|$|The {{morning of}} the 3d was fine, and we rowed slowly {{along the coast of}} Makian. The captain of a small prau at anchor, seeing me on deck and {{guessing}} who I was, made signals for us to stop, and brought me a letter from Charles Allen, who informed me he had been at Ternate twenty days, and was anxiously waiting my arrival. This was good news, as I was equally anxious about him, and it cheered up my spirits. A light southerly wind now sprung up, and we {{thought we were going to}} have fine weather. It soon changed, however, to its old quarter, the west; dense clouds gathered over the sky, and in less than half an hour we had the severest squall we had experienced during our whole voyage. Luckily we got our great mainsail down in time, or the consequences might have been serious. It was a regular little hurricane, and my old Bugis steersman began shouting out to [...] "Allah! il Allah!" [...] to preserve us. We could only keep up our jib, which was almost blown to rags, but by careful handling it kept us before the wind, and the prau behaved very well. Our small boat (purchased at Gani) was towing astern, and soon got full of water, so that it broke away and we saw no more of it. In about an hour the fury of the wind abated a little, and in two more we were able to hoist our mainsail, reefed and half-mast high. Towards evening it cleared up and fell calm, and the sea, which had been rather high, soon went down. Not being much of a seaman myself I had been considerably alarmed, and even the old steersman assured me he had never been in a worse squall all his life. He was now more than ever confirmed in his opinion of the unluckiness of the boat, and in the efficiency of the holy oil which all Bugis praus had poured through their bottoms. As it was, he imputed our safety and the quick termination of the squall entirely to his own prayers, <b>saying</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> [...] "Yes, that's the way we always do on board our praus; when things are at the worst we stand up and shout out our prayers as loud as we can, and then Tuwan Allah helps us." ...|$|R
6000|$|Had he no {{thoughts}} of her, whose sole delight he was, and {{whom he had}} unconsciously plunged in such bitter sorrow and such deep affliction? Oh, yes.

What delight it gave her to hear of the bravery of her poor boy! Ah! He would have known that, without Hugh's telling him. And what a precious thing it was to know she lived so happily, and heard with so much pride (he pictured to himself her look when they told her) that he was in such high esteem: bold among the boldest, and trusted before them all! And when these frays were over, and the good lord had conquered his enemies, and they were all at peace again, and he and she were rich, what happiness they would have in talking of these troubled times when he was a great soldier: and when they sat alone together in the tranquil twilight, and she had no longer reason to be anxious for the morrow, what pleasure would he have in the reflection that this was his doing--his--poor foolish Barnaby's; and in patting her on the cheek, and <b>saying</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> merry <b>laugh,</b> 'Am I silly now, mother--am I silly now?' ...|$|R
