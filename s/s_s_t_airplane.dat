Difference fields between the warm and cold integrations are statistically {{significant at the}} 1 % level with positive geopotential height over the central N Atlantic, and weaker negative height over Europe. The storm track over the Atlantic is displaced from its normal position. Results from 4 further pairs of integrations with halved <b>s.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>t.</b> anomalies are also described. The response is approximately linear, with systematic differences in 500 mb geopotential height over the Atlantic, parts of which are just significant at the 10 % level with half the full <b>s.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>t.</b> anomaly. Overall, however, the model's response is weaker than could be obtained with tropical <b>s.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>t.</b> anomalies of the same magnitude. Results from the model integrations are compared with results from an observational study {{of the relationship between}} wintertime <b>s.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>t.</b> in the NW Atlantic, and mean sea level pressure and 500 mb height.

40|$|For a {{complexity}} measure κ, a set is κ-infinite if {{it contains}} a κ-decidable infinite subset. For a time-based κ, we prove {{that there is a}} recursive <b>S</b> <b>s.</b> <b>t.</b> both <b>S</b> and its complements, S̅, are infinite but not κ-infinite. Lipton [6] states that the existence of a recursive set <b>S</b> <b>s.</b> <b>t.</b> neither <b>S</b> nor S̅ os polynomially infinite is not a purely logical consequence of ∏^ 0 _ 2 theorems of Peano's Arithmetic PA.

40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) {{represents}} a bright prospect that {{a variety of}} common appliances can connect to one another, {{as well as with the}} rest of the Internet, to vastly improve our lives. Unique communication and security challenges have been brought out by the limited hardware, low-complexity, and severe energy constraints of IoT devices. In addition, a severe spectrum scarcity problem has also been stimulated by the use of a large number of IoT devices. In this paper, cognitive IoT (CIoT) is considered where an IoT network works as the secondary system using underlay spectrum sharing. A wireless energy harvesting (EH) node is used as a relay to improve the coverage of an IoT device. However, the relay could be a potential eavesdropper to intercept the IoT device’s messages. This paper considers the problem of secure communication between the IoT device (e. g., sensor) and a destination (e. g., controller) via the wireless EH untrusted relay. Since the destination can be equipped with adequate energy supply, secure schemes based on destination-aided jamming are proposed based on power splitting (PS) and time splitting (TS) policies, called intuitive secure schemes based on PS (Int-PS), precoded secure scheme based on PS (Pre-PS), intuitive secure scheme based on TS (Int-TS) and precoded secure scheme based on TS (Pre-TS), respectively. The secure performances of the proposed schemes are evaluated through the metric of probability of successfully secure transmission (P <b>S</b> <b>S</b> <b>T),</b> which represents the probability that the interference constraint of the primary user is satisfied and the secrecy rate is positive. P <b>S</b> <b>S</b> <b>T</b> is analyzed for the proposed secure schemes, and the closed form expressions of P <b>S</b> <b>S</b> <b>T</b> for Pre-PS and Pre-TS are derived and validated through simulation results. Numerical results show that the precoded secure schemes have better P <b>S</b> <b>S</b> <b>T</b> than the intuitive secure schemes under similar power consumption. When the secure schemes based on PS and TS polices have similar P <b>S</b> <b>S</b> <b>T,</b> the average transmit power consumption of the secure scheme based on TS is lower. The influences of power splitting and time slitting ratios are also discussed through simulations...|$|R
