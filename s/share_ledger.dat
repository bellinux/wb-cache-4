30|$|Ongoing {{transformation}} from centralized to distributed generation pattern naturally calls for robust, effective, and secure cyber infrastructures {{to support the}} complex communications interactions of {{the large number of}} distributed energy entities. A recent technology in the distributed computing paradigm, i.e. Blockchain [4], provides a new promising solution for the cyber infrastructure of next-generation grids. As a distributed computing technology for establishing a reliable, <b>shared</b> <b>ledger</b> through cryptography, consensus mechanism, and smart contract, Blockchain has gained huge successes in the finance field, i.e. the BitCoin system [4]. Its notable features, including decentralized, scalable, non-temperability and securitry, make it be promising to act as an information and communication backbone of many application domains in future energy systems.|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the interaction between}} directors and small shareholders who made {{up the majority of}} names on the <b>share</b> <b>ledgers</b> of many companies in both the UK and the USA. It is concerned with the period 1890 – 1965 and concentrates on the management/shareholder relationship {{in the context of the}} annual general meeting and shareholder activism. I argue that there were significant differences between shareholder activism in the UK and the USA, due to the difference in relative numbers of the shareholders themselves, to legal and geographic differences, to corporate culture, and to the earlier diffusion of shareholding in the UK compared to the USA. UK shareholders concentrated their interventions on management issues, as well as some social and labor matters. US shareholders, mostly through so-called ‘corporate gadflies’, concentrated their efforts on corporate governance issues, some of which were already enshrined in UK company law and practice...|$|R
40|$|To support dynamic {{communities}} of interests in coalition operations, new architectures for efficient sharing of ISR assets are needed. The use of blockchain technology in wired business environments, such as digital currency systems, offers an interesting solution {{by creating a}} way to maintain a distributed <b>shared</b> <b>ledger</b> without requiring a single trusted authority. In this paper, we discuss how a blockchain-based system can be modified to provide a solution for dynamic asset sharing amongst coalition members, enabling {{the creation of a}} logically centralized asset management system by a seamless policy-compliant federation of different coalition systems. We discuss the use of blockchain for three different types of assets in a coalition context, showing how blockchain can offer a suitable solution for sharing assets in those environments. We also discuss the limitations in the current implementations of blockchain which need to be overcome for the technology to become more effective in a decentralized tactical edge environment...|$|R
5000|$|Ripple {{relies on}} a common <b>shared</b> <b>ledger,</b> which is a {{distributed}} database storing information about all Ripple accounts. The network is [...] "managed by a network of independent validating servers that constantly compare their transaction records." [...] Servers could belong to anyone, including banks or market makers. Though the Ripple protocol is freeware, Ripple Labs continues to develop and promote the Ripple protocol, which confirms financial transactions via a network of distributed servers. Ripple Labs is currently assisting banks in integrating with the Ripple network. A new ledger is created every few seconds, and the last closed ledger is a perfect record of all Ripple accounts {{as determined by the}} network of servers. A transaction is any proposed change to the ledger and can be introduced by any server to the network. The servers attempt to come to consensus about a set of transactions to apply to the ledger, creating a new ‘last closed ledger’.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the desire}} for {{financial}} privacy and anonymity spurred the growth of electronic cash and cryptocurrencies. The introduction of decentralized cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, accelerated their adoption in society. Since digital information is easier to reproduce, digital currencies are vulnerable to be spent more than once – {{this is called a}} double-spending attack. In order to prevent double-spending, Bitcoin records transactions in a tamper-resilient <b>shared</b> <b>ledger</b> called the blockchain. However, the time required to generate new blocks in the blockchain causes a delay in the transaction confirmation. This delay, typically around one hour in Bitcoin, is impractical for real world trade and limits the wide-spread use of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. In this thesis, we propose a solution to prevent double-spending attacks and thus enable fast transaction confirmations using the security guarantees of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). We achieve this by enforcing sign-once semantics that prevent the payer from reusing designated signing keys to sign more than one transaction. We also provide a way for the payee to verify whether a specific signing key is subject to sign-once semantics. The payee, however still receives the funds later, once the transaction is verified similarly to existing credit card payments. In this way, our solution reduces transaction confirmation times of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and is also compatible with existing deployments since it does not require any modifications to the base protocol, peers, or miners. We designed and implemented a proof-of-concept of our solution using Intel SGX technology and integrated it with Copay, a popular Bitcoin wallet from BitPay. This thesis also presents the security evaluation of our system along with other possible extensions and enhancements...|$|R
30|$|In {{the above}} measures, {{the two most}} {{distinctive}} methods are the channel and privacy data collection. The channel {{is dedicated to the}} blockchain privacy protection, allowing the data on the channel to be isolated separately. The peer on the same channel <b>shares</b> a <b>ledger,</b> the transaction peer needs to obtain the recognition of the channel before it can join the channel and transact with others. The PDC (private data collection) is a collection of organizations that are authorized to store private data on a channel, and the data stored includes: (1) Private data, which implements peer-to-peer communication between authorized organizations through the Gossip protocol. The privacy data is stored in the peer’s private database. (2) The hash value of private data. For private data, the peers on the channel use the hash value of the private data when sorting and writing the endorsement, as evidence of the existence of the transaction and for state validation and auditing.|$|R
30|$|Bitcoin “runs {{a payment}} system…employs {{subcontractors}} who are miners… {{paid for with}} newly issued bitcoin shares in itself” (Vigna and Casey 2015, p. 229, quoting Larimer 2013). 2 The Bitcoin system thus shares the four core features common to all conceptualizations of “organizations”: it is a “multi-agent system […] with identifiable boundaries and [a] purpose […] towards which the constituent agents’ efforts make a contribution” (Puranam 2017, p. 6). But in contrast to traditional organizations, Bitcoin {{does not have a}} CEO or top management team but instead developers who “write the rulebook,” i.e., define governance rules for the program (Narayanan et al. 2016, pp. 173 – 175). Bitcoin does not have headquarters, subsidiaries, or employees, but a distributed network of users and miners who collect, verify, and update transactions on a <b>shared</b> public <b>ledger</b> that is publicly auditable. Decisions on code modifications are made through community-based democratic voting processes, backed by miners’ computing power for implementation (Narayanan et al. 2016, pp. 173 – 175).|$|R

30|$|Bitcoin is {{a digital}} {{currency}} created in 2009 {{as an alternative}} to the banking system. Not only does it offer a payment mechanism without any centralized control (i.e. by institutions, governments, or banks), but it has also introduced the revolutionary concept of the blockchain. All the Bitcoin transactions are indeed recorded in the blockchain, a <b>shared</b> public <b>ledger,</b> organized in chronological order within blocks and made secure thanks to strong cryptography. Using end-user softwares called Bitcoin clients, users can easily interact with the blockchain, performing Bitcoin transactions (i.e. transfer of Bitcoin value between identifiers of alphanumeric characters string called Bitcoin addresses). Bitcoin users typically use services called Bitcoin exchangers, to buy and sell Bitcoin in exchange for other currencies at a price fluctuating freely. Thanks to a growing number of merchants and services that let people use Bitcoin all over the world, especially during the last years, Bitcoin has become a solid reality and a fascinating object of study. The possible future applications of the blockchain and of cryptocurrencies in general appear as very promising, even if this technology is relatively new and at the first stage of its evolution.|$|R
50|$|A gateway is {{any person}} or {{organization}} that enables users {{to put money}} into and take money out of Ripple's liquidity pool. A gateway accepts currency deposits from users and issues balances into Ripple's distributed ledger. Furthermore, gateways redeem ledger balances against the deposits they hold when currency is withdrawn. In practice, gateways are similar to banks, yet they <b>share</b> one global <b>ledger</b> known as the Ripple protocol. Depending on the type and degree of interaction a user has with a gateway, the gateway may have anti-money laundering (AML) or know your customer (KYC) policies requiring verification of identification, address, nationality, etc. to prevent criminal activity. Popular gateways as of 2017 included Bitstamp, Gatehub, Ripple Fox, Tokyo JPY, Mr. Ripple, RippleChina and The Rock Trading.|$|R
40|$|International audience—Decentralized {{cryptocurrency}} systems offer {{a medium}} of exchange secured by cryptography, without the need of a centralized banking authority. Among others, Bitcoin is considered as the most mature one. Its popularity lies on {{the introduction of the}} concept of the blockchain, a public distributed <b>ledger</b> <b>shared</b> by all participants of the system. Double spending attacks and blockchain forks are two main issues in blockchain-based protocols. The first one refers to the ability of an adversary to use the very same bitcoin more than once, while blockchain forks cause transient inconsistencies in the blockchain. We show through probabilistic analysis that the reliability of recent solutions that exclusively rely on a particular type of Bitcoin actors, called miners, to guarantee the consistency of Bitcoin operations, drastically decreases with the size of the blockchain...|$|R
40|$|Blockchains are <b>shared,</b> {{immutable}} <b>ledgers</b> {{for recording}} {{the history of}} transactions. They foster {{a new generation of}} transactional applications that establish trust, accountability, and transparency. It enables contract partners to secure a deal without involving a trusted third party. Initially, the focus was on financial industry for digital assets trading like Bitcoin, but with the emergence of Smart Contracts, blockchain becomes a complete programmable platform. Many research and commercial organization start diving into blockchain world, bringing new ideas of its application in different sectors like supply chain, Health, and autonomous shopping. This thesis presents an idea to integrate Internet of Things (IoT) devices via a blockchain based decentralize application based on Ethereum. The application consists of front-end application which can be deployed to any web server, and a smart contract which will be deployed on a private blockchain network comprises of Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) connected IoT devices acting as full Ethereum node. The application emulates the digital transport ticketing system where the asset is a ticket which can be purchased and paid by the user using ether in their Ethereum account on the blockchain. Once the purchase transaction is mined, it is propagated to all the peers. Ticket can now be accessed locally without requesting any centralized system, which makes the system easily accessible and safe because of the security, data integrity and decentralization of the blockchain-based systems...|$|R
40|$|There is {{considerable}} scope {{for increasing the}} understanding of the history of share ownership. Existing studies of shareholders in the UK are limited in the industries, time periods and shareholder populations they study. This article outlines the methods used by the authors in an ESRC-funded study of shareholders in companies in England and Wales from 1870 to 1930. Data were drawn from companies' shareholder records — the Form Es submitted annually to the Registrar of Companies and the <b>share</b> registers and <b>ledgers</b> maintained by companies. The article outlines the rationale for the industrial sectors selected for study, the choice of companies and the basis on which shareholder records were sampled. The resulting database contains details of over 29, 000 individual shareholders who collectively had over 33, 000 shareholdings, and is larger and more representative of the investor population than any previously compiled in the UK. ...|$|R
30|$|Blockchain, first {{proposed}} by Satoshi Nakamoto [4], {{is designed to}} achieve peer-to-peer electronic payments directly, without participation of a trusted third party. During the past 10 years, it has been explosively discussed and has shown huge potential in many domains. Essentially, Blockchain is a distributed, redundant, chain-connected, <b>ledger</b> <b>sharing</b> database, in which each node in the network is fault-tolerant and can achieve point-to-point communications. The Blockchain can be categories into two classes: public chain and generalized private chain. Public chain represents a fully opened network, in which every individual or institution can join and leave freely, and every participant is able to send transactions to others and is scramble for the accounting right. The generalized private chain imposes restrictions on the participant, {{and it can be}} further categorized into two types: consortium chain and fully private chain. Consortium chain usually refers to a network that is composed of a few institution-consortiums, and consortiums can cooperate with others but are not fully trusted; the fully private chain is more computationally efficient because it has strict access, read and write permissions.|$|R
40|$|Industries and {{old ways}} of doing {{business}} have been reshaped or become entirely obsolete due to the new digitalization trends. The current technology to truly revolutionize and disrupt especially industries that rely on trust, such as the financial sector, is the blockchain technology. The core idea of this technol-ogy {{is that it is}} a public, <b>shared</b> and tamperproof <b>ledger</b> that allows people who do not know or even trust in each other to share information in a trustworthy ledger, where any sorts of immaterial infor-mation of value can be stored. This thesis is a literature review that provides a theoretical framework to examine how the blockchain technology affects particularly the financial sector. As this thesis acknowledges, the blockchain technology has the ability to enhance efficiency, increase transparency, reduce risks when less assets are tied up during transactions and reduce expenditures, such as transaction costs in the financial sector. One of the most ambitious application of the blockchain technology is smart contracts, but there are other applications as well that can benefit the financial sec-tor. The technology has great potential to disrupt the current financial system, but since the technology is still in its initial stage of development, it is too early to say what the blockchain technology will exactly enable. The most extreme hypothesis is that the blockchain technology makes banks unnecessary. How-ever, this thesis argues that the financial institutions are more likely to take advantage of the blockchain technology than to become obsolete because of it. ...|$|R
