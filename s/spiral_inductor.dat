50|$|In 2015 a coiled form of {{graphene}} {{was discovered}} in graphitic carbon (coal). The spiraling effect is produced by defects in the material's hexagonal grid that causes it to spiral along its edge, mimicking a Riemann surface, with the graphene surface approximately perpendicular to the axis. When voltage is applied to such a coil, current flows around the spiral, producing a magnetic field. The phenomenon applies to spirals with either zigzag or armchair orientations, although with different current distributions. Computer simulations indicated that a conventional <b>spiral</b> <b>inductor</b> of 205 microns in diameter could be matched by a nanocoil just 70 nanometers wide, with a field strength reaching as much as 1 tesla, {{about the same as}} the coils found in typical loudspeakers, about the same field strength as some MRI machines.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 The {{advent of}} {{low-cost}} RFIC's fabricated in Silicon-based technologies {{has led to}} the use of monolithic lumped elements which are located on-die. While it is clearly advantageous to have a high degree of integration and thus fewer off chip elements, parasitic losses due to semiconducting substrate effects can be a performance-limiting factor. Microstrip <b>spiral</b> <b>inductors</b> are key components in many high frequency circuit designs, including MMIC's, RFIC's, and mixed-signal modules. However, the losses associated with spirals fabricated in a lossy substrate environment, such as in CMOS and bipolar technologies, are not accurately modeled by the current conventional techniques. This thesis presents a complete modeling technique for <b>spiral</b> <b>inductors</b> over such 'high-loss' substrates. The quasi-static solution for single and coupled Metal-Insulator-Substrate (MIS) microstrip structures {{has led to the}} development of methods for calculating the self and mutual line parameters r, l, g, and c, which are in turn utilized in the model for the microstrip <b>spiral</b> <b>inductors</b> in the same environment. The equivalent circuit model for the <b>spiral</b> <b>inductors</b> is based on the conventional low-loss spiral models with the inclusion of frequency-dependent losses due to semiconducting substrates. The distributed model for spirals in CMOS-based RFICs incorporates inductance calculations by the Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) method, augmented by inductance and resistance calculations for the so-called skin effect mode by the spectral domain technique. In addition, the capacitances and shunt conductances can be computed by a Poisson solver for layered lossy media; both network analog and spectral domain methods are also used to find the shunt admittance per unit length for the microstrip structure as a fundamental element of the spiral.
