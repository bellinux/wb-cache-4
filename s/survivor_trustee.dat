40|$|The {{rules that}} govern the {{creation}} of an estate plan are in flux. Courts once demanded strict adherence to the Wills Act. Yet, this legacy of hyper-vigilance is waning, as the Uniform Probate Code, the Restatement (Third) of Property, and ten states have adopted the harmless error rule. Meanwhile, trusts, which need not comply with the Wills Act, have eclipsed wills as the dominant method of posthumous wealth transmission. This Article explores three budding topics that threaten to further complicate this area. First, there are anecdotal accounts of decedents trying to make electronic wills. In both strict compliance and harmless error jurisdictions, e-wills raise thorny issues about the meaning of “signed” and “writing” in the Wills Act, and when, if ever, courts should be able to overlook violations of the statute. Second, despite the received wisdom that trusts are less formal than wills, a rising number of settlors are failing to observe the arcane principles {{that govern the}} transfer of property into a trust. Third, most state legislatures have adopted or are currently considering statutes that give fiduciaries access to the contents of a decedent’s email, text messaging, and social media accounts. But the precise steps necessary to convey these cutting-edge forms of property after death is unclear. This Article tries to help courts and policymakers regulate these matters by offering a fresh perspective on the purpose of mechanical, bright-line principles in the realm of estate planning. As conventionally framed, this debate revolves around what the Article calls the “intent paradigm”: the idea that execution doctrines should be gauged primarily by whether they facilitate or frustrate the wishes of individual decedents. Conversely, this Article explores a different virtue of formalism: its ability to prevent decedents from imposing spillover costs. This Article demonstrates how some unyielding principles limit the burden on courts, <b>survivors,</b> <b>trustees,</b> the trustee’s creditors, purchasers of trust property, and other third parties. It then explains how recognizing this anti-externality function can pay dividends in wills law, trust law, and emerging niches such as the inheritability of digital assets...|$|R
60|$|To {{this purpose}} I wrote {{to my old}} friend at Lisbon, who in return gave me notice, that he could easily dispose of it there: but that if I thought fit to give him leave to offer it in my name to the two merchants, the <b>survivors</b> of my <b>trustees,</b> {{who lived in the}} Brasils, who must fully {{understand}} the value of it, who lived just upon the spot, and who I knew to be very rich, so that he believed they would be fond of buying it; he did not doubt, but I should make 4 or 5000 pieces of eight the more of it.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{come to the}} end of my travels, I soon {{discovered}} my new found estate, and all the bills of exchange I had were currently paid. The good ancient widow, my only privy counsellor, thought no pains nor care too great to procure my advantage, nor had I ever occasion to blame her fidelity, which drew from me an ample reward. I was for leaving my effects in her hands, intending to set out for Lisbon, and so the Brazils; but as in the Desolate Island I had some doubt about the Romish religion, so I knew there was little encouragement to settle there, unless I would apostatize from the orthodox faith, or live in continual fear of the Inquisition. Upon this account I resolved to sell my plantation; and, for that intent, I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who returned to me an answer to my great satisfaction; which was, that he could sell it to good account; however, if I thought it convenient to give him liberty to offer it in my name to the two merchants, the <b>survivors</b> of my <b>trustees</b> residing at the Brazils, who consequently knew its intrinsic value, having lived just upon the spot, and who I was sensible were very rich, and therefore might be the more willing to purchase it: he did not in the least doubt, but that I should make four or five thousand pieces of eight more of it, than I could, if I disposed of it in any other manner whatsoever.|$|R
60|$|Here I {{found my}} first Captain's widow alive, who had buried a second husband, but in very mean circumstances, and whom I made easy upon his account. Soon after I {{went down to}} Yorkshire, where all my family were expired, except two sisters, and as many {{of one of my}} brother's children. I found no {{provision}} had been made for me, they concluding I had been long since dead; so that I was but in a very slender station. Indeed the Captain did me a great kindness, by his report to the owners, how I had delivered their ship on the Desolate Island, upon which they made me a present of 200L. sterling. I next went to Lisbon, taking my man Friday with me, and there arriving in April, I met the Portuguese Captain who had taken me on board on the African coast; but, being ancient, he had left off the sea, and resigned all his business to his son, who followed the Brazil trade. So altered both of us were, that we did not know each other at first, till I discovered myself more fully to him. After a few embraces, I began to enquire of my concerns; and then the old gentleman {{told me that it was}} nine years since he had been at Brazil, where my partner was then living, but my trustees were both dead; that he believed I should have a good account of the product of my plantation; that the imagination of my being lost, had obliged my trustees to give an estimate of my share to the procurator fiscal, who, in case of my not returning, had given one third to the king & the rest to the monastery of St. Augustine: but if I put in my claim, or any one for me, it would be returned, except the yearly product which was given to the poor. I then desired him to tell me what improvement he thought had been made of my plantation, and whether he imagined it was worth my while to look after it? he answered, he did not know how much it was improved; but this he was certain of, that my partner was grown vastly rich upon his half of it; and, that he had been informed, that the kind had 200 moidores per annum of his third part. He added, that the <b>survivors</b> of my <b>trustees</b> were nervous of an ingenuous character; that my partner could witness my title, my name being registered in the country, by which means I should indefensibly recover considerable sums of money, but, answered, I, how could my trustees dispose of my effects, when I made you only my heir? This, said he, was true but, there being no affidavit made of my death he could not act as my executor. However, he had ordered his don,(then at Brazil), to act by procuration upon my account, and he had taken possession of my sugar-house, having accounted himself for eight years with my partner and trustees for the profits, of which he would give me a very good account.|$|R
