40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} in {{fog dispersal}} technology is briefly discussed. Fog is categorized as <b>supercooled</b> <b>fog,</b> occurring in air temperatures below freezing, and warm fog, occurring at above-freezing temperatures. Operational techniques {{are available to}} disperse <b>supercooled</b> <b>fog</b> in the airport area. It {{is much more difficult}} to cope with warm fog. Various known concepts to disperse warm fog are evaluated as to their operational merits. The most effective concept for immediate use involves heating the air to cause fog evaporation. Use of helicopter downwash has some application, possibly complementing the promising concept of seeding with sized hygroscopic particles. These latter two concepts appear to have future application, pending further research. The concept using polyelectrolytes is of uncertain value, lacking both a scientific explanation and a substantive evaluation of reported operational successes...|$|E
40|$|Both {{the similar}} and {{different}} effects of freezing drizzle, sleet and snow on microphysical properties of <b>supercooled</b> <b>fog</b> were analyzed for fourteen events during a comprehensive wire icing, fog, and precipitation observation experiment conducted at Enshi radar station (30 ° 17 ′N, 109 ° 16 ′E; 1722 m a. s. l.) on a hilltop in Shibanling, Hubei, China. Liquid precipitation is {{in a relatively}} stable form in mountainous areas. Short-term precipitation (1 – 3 h) is dominant with temperature below 0 °C. The wet scavenging effect of freezing drizzle on small fog droplets with a size range less than 6 – 12 μm is weak but is stronger for fog droplets with a larger size, which is opposite {{to the effects of}} solid precipitation, broadening the fog droplet spectra significantly. As the fog droplet diameter increases, the distributions of droplet spectra change from leptokurtosis to platykurtosis and from positive skewness to negative skewness. Occurrence of freezing drizzle would improve the positive correlation of N-r in dissipation and oscillation periods, resulting in the N-r relationship having a weak negative correlation in the maturity period, and resulting in the transition of the N-L and N-r relationships into positive correlations in the development period. Meanwhile, the emergence of solid precipitation particles would result in negative values for the correlation coefficients of N-L and N-r. The change in relationships among the microphysical properties was caused by the occurrence of different phase precipitation, showing the influence on the main microphysical mechanisms of <b>supercooled</b> <b>fog...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} new {{results from}} studies of aircraft-produced ice particles (APIPs) in <b>supercooled</b> <b>fog</b> and clouds. Nine aircraft, including a Beech King Air 200 T cloud physics aircraft, a Piper Aztec, a Cessna 421 -C, two North American T- 28 s, an Aero Commander, a Piper Navajo, a Beech Turbo Baron, and a second four-bladed King Air {{were involved in the}} tests. The instrumented King Air served as the monitoring aircraft for trails of ice particles created, or not created, when the other aircraft were flown through clouds at various temperatures and served as both the test and monitoring aircraft when it itself was tested. In some cases sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) gas was released by the test aircraft during its test run and was detected by the King Air during its monitoring passes to confirm the location of the test aircraft wake. Ambient temperatures for the tests ranged between 258 and 2128 C. The results confirm earlier published results and provide further insights into the APIPs phenomenon. The King Air at ambient temperatures less than 288 C can produce APIPs readily. The Piper Aztec and the Aero Commander also produced APIPs under the test conditions in which they were flown. The Cessna 421, Piper Navajo, and Beech Turbo Baron did not. The APIPs production potential of a T- 28 is still indeterminate because a limited range of conditions was tested. Homogeneous nucleation in the adiabatically cooled regions where air is expanding around the rapidly rotating propeller tips is the cause of APIPs. A...|$|E

40|$|Oil and gas {{activities}} in the cold seas are endangered by icing. Icing may occur when water spray or moisture is deposited on a vessel or offshore structure above sea level and the air temperatures is below the freezing temperature of water. Ice accumulation can block rescue equipment and doors, and clog ventilation systems, which may {{increase the risk of}} explosion as result of volatile gas accumulation. Icing can be caused by <b>supercooled</b> <b>fog,</b> freezing rain, falling snow and freezing sea spray. The freezing sea spray caused 80 – 90 % of all offshore icing incidents and is the focus of this study. To take precautions against icing, {{it is important to understand}} the physics of icing and to model it. The rate of ice accretion is mainly defined by the spray flux and heat transfer, and both must be accurately predicted. Existing icing models, e. g., ICEMOD and RIGICE 04, simplify the structure, subdividing it into cylindrical and flat components. In these models, airflow around a component is assumed to be unaffected by other parts of the structure, and the heat transfer is approximated using empirical relations. In reality, however, the airflow field is complex. Upwind components can create wind shadow regions or regions of accelerated flow in front of downwind components; this changes both the spray flux and the heat transfer, thus making ICEMOD and RIGICE 04 inadequate. A research subject of this PhD study was the heat transfer and spray flow around a structure in a real airflow. The full-scale measurements in the literature are limited and it is expensive to perform them. Therefore, for a preliminary answer the question was addressed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which is capable of predicting the spray flow and heat transfer around a structure with any shape; however, the accuracy of CFD is uncertain. Existing models of sea spray icing, e. g., ICEMOD and RIGICE 04, neglect heat flux into the accreted ice and assume that air cooling is directly spent to freeze the water film on the ice surface. This assumption is good for steady ice growth. However, it is also used in modelling icing caused by periodic sea spray. This study proves numerically and experimentally that the heat flux into the accreted ice generated by freezing must not be neglected. The main contributions of this work are as follows: The study develops the marine icing model, MARICE, which uses CFD to calculate spray flux and heat transfer, and models water film motion on any arbitrary surface. · The study shows that Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models should be used with care in icing simulations: the collision efficiency is well predicted upstream flow separation point by any RANS turbulence model; however, the wake and separation of the flow is modelled poorly. · The study develops and validates a new model of ice growth caused by periodic sea spray, which accounts for the heat conduction inside the accreted ice...|$|E
