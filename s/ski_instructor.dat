Smythe remained in Europe after the war, found the gold {{with the help of a}} mountain guide, and killed him in order to keep it for himself.

5|$|He {{was born}} Nils Johan Nilsen to a Norwegian family in Seljeskog in Salangen on 3 June 1894, {{as the oldest}} of six children. As a child, Nelsen was an active skier and ski jumper, with more than fifteen ski jumps located in the area. In 1913, his family emigrated to Big Eddy near Revelstoke. Once in Canada, he anglicized his name. His brother, Ivind Nilsen was also a {{champion}} ski jumper, and became among other things Boy's World Champion in 1922. Ivind, who chose not to anglicize his last name, {{was known for his}} supreme style, while Nels was better known for his length. Nelsen married Emma Pickard, with whom he had ten children. Except for a brief period as a <b>ski</b> <b>instructor,</b> he worked as a brakeman and conductor for the Canadian Pacific Railway, whose flexibility made it easer to participate in tournaments. He moved to North Vancouver where he raised his family.|$|E

He continued in his previous occupation as a ski-instructor at Nipissing Ridge on weekends as well as working at his father's fishing camp during the summer season.

[...] While Mawson was intending to recruit only British subjects (chiefly Australians and New Zealanders), Mertz's qualifications prompted him to make an exception, and hire the Swiss as a <b>ski</b> <b>instructor.</b> First, however, he was given responsibility for the expedition's 49Greenland Huskies, aboard the expedition ship SY Aurora, bound for Hobart.|$|E

They don't have any reference on these things." [...] Joining Guèye at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, and becoming the second Senegalese athlete to compete at a Winter Games, was <b>ski</b> <b>instructor</b> Alphonse Gomis, who resides in Tignes, near Albertville.

500|$|In 1975 Bundy shifted {{much of his}} {{criminal}} activity eastward, from his base in Utah to Colorado. On January 12, a 23-year-old registered nurse named Caryn Eileen Campbell disappeared while walking down a well-lit hallway between the elevator and her room at the Wildwood Inn (now the Wildwood Lodge) in Snowmass Village, [...] southeast of Salt Lake City. Her nude body was found a month later next to a dirt road just outside the resort. She {{had been killed by}} blows to her head from a blunt instrument that left distinctive linear grooved depressions on her skull; her body also bore deep cuts from a sharp weapon. A hundred miles (160km) northeast of Snowmass, on March 15, Vail <b>ski</b> <b>instructor</b> Julie Cunningham, 26, disappeared while walking from her apartment to a dinner date with a friend. Bundy later told Colorado investigators that he approached Cunningham on crutches and asked her to help carry his ski boots to his car, where he clubbed and handcuffed her, then assaulted and strangled her at a secondary site near Rifle, Colorado, [...] west of Vail. Weeks later, he made the six-hour drive from Salt Lake City to revisit her remains.|$|E
500|$|During the 1925 Winter Carnival Tournament, Nelsen, {{sick with}} influenza, set {{a world record}} at the Big Hill. Jumping 73meters (240ft), the record {{remained}} until it was broken by Adolph Badrut at Bernina-Roseg-Schanze in Switzerland in 1930, who jumped [...] However, Bob Lymburne was able to again claim the world record for the Big Hill, when he jumped [...] in 1932. Although accepted as a record, it {{was not at the}} time favored in Europe to stress distance records. This was because it was regarded that simply building a larger hill would undoubtedly give a longer jump, and in part because such records did not take style into consideration. Nelsen and Melbourne McKenzie planned to travel to St. Moritz, Switzerland, to attend the 1928 Winter Olympics, but lack of funding meant that they planned for work for their fare on a freighter. These plans were stopped by officials from the British delegation, who felt it was inappropriate and not fitting for the team, and Nelsen never competed in any Winter Olympics. Nelsen kept his amateur status, but did well against professionals those times he competed against them. During the winter of 1932, he worked as a <b>ski</b> <b>instructor</b> in Quebec. In a hunting accident in 1932, he lost an arm, and never jumped again.|$|E

Although Mills proposed to Karmal, she later said that every man she has been out with [...] "has asked me to marry him within a week". The couple married on 6 May 1989. While married to Karmal, she suffered two ectopic pregnancies, so Karmal paid for her to go on holiday to Croatia with his children and ex-wife (with whom Mills had become friends) in 1990, but Mills ended up living with her <b>ski</b> <b>instructor,</b> Miloš Pogačar, shortly before the Croatian War began. Mills set up a refugee crisis centre in London, helping over 20 people to escape the war.
