40|$|Part 1 : Sustainable ProductionInternational audienceThis {{research}} {{focuses on}} a parallel machines scheduling problem considering lot streaming {{which is similar to}} the traditional hybrid flow shop scheduling (HFS). In a typical HFS with parallel machines problem, the allocation of machine resources for each order should be determined in advance. In addition, the size of each <b>sublot</b> is splited by parallel machines configuration. However, allocation of machine resources, <b>sublot</b> size and lot sequence are highly mutual influence. If allocation of machine resources has been determined, adjustment on production sequence is unable to reduce production makespan. Without splitting a given job into sublots, the production scheduling cannot have overlapping of successive operations in multi-stage parallel machines environment thereby contributing to the best production scheduling. Therefore, this research motivated from a solar cell industry is going to explore these issues. The multi-stage and parallel-machines scheduling problem in the solar cell industry simultaneously considers the optimal <b>sublot</b> size, <b>sublot</b> sequence, parallel machines <b>sublot</b> scheduling and machine configurations through dynamically allocating all <b>sublot</b> to parallel machines. We formulate this problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model considering the practical characteristics including parallel machines, dedicated machines, sequence-independent setup time, and sequence-dependent setup time. A hybrid-coded particle swarm optimization (HCPSO) is developed to find a near-optimal solution. At the end of this study, the result of this research will compare with the optimization method of mixed integer linear programming and case study...|$|E

Finally, we provide recommendations on how to design the material handling flow system to implement our suggested inspection policies. Some of the managerial implications we found is that quality improves significantly when Stage 2 is more responsive (has faster processing times) than Stage 1 and when large batch sizes are divided into more sublots.

The primary motivation {{is to improve the}} measures of performance by the quick movement of work in the shop. In this thesis, we study various forms of the lot streaming problem in flow shops to derive the characteristics of optimal solutions. We first analyze single job lot streaming problems, then extend the results to multi-job problems. When there is a single job, the lot streaming problem is to find the best transfer batch sizes that optimizes the given criterion. We consider three different measures of performance, job, <b>sublot</b> and item completion time criteria. We derive a closed form solution for a special case of job completion time criterion. Under <b>sublot</b> completion time criterion, when the first machine has the largest processing time, we show that partial transfers of equal size are optimal. We propose two polynomial time algorithms for the problem in which only two transfer batches are permitted between each consecutive machines for <b>sublot</b> and item completion time criteria. In multi-job lot streaming problems, the sequencing and lot streaming decisions must be considered simultaneously.

Lot streaming {{refers to the}} process of splitting jobs to move production through several stages as quickly as possible, whereas batch scheduling refers {{to the process of}} grouping jobs to improve the use of resources and customer satisfaction. We use a network representation and critical path approach to analyse the lot streaming problem of finding optimal <b>sublot</b> sizes and a job sequence in a two-machine flow shop with transportation and setup times. We introduce a model where the number of sublots for each job is not predetermined, presenting an algorithm to assign a new <b>sublot</b> efficiently, and discuss a heuristic to assign a fixed number of sublots between jobs. A model with several identical jobs in an multiple machine flow shop is analysed through a dominant machine approach to find optimal <b>sublot</b> sizes for jobs. For batch scheduling, we tackle the NP-hard problem of scheduling jobs on a batching machine with restricted batch size to minimise the maximum lateness. We design a branch and bound algorithm, and develop local search heuristics for the problem. Different neighbourhoods are compared, one of which is an exponential sized neighbourhood that can be searched in polynomial time. We develop dynamic programming algorithms to obtain lower bounds and explore neighbourhoods efficiently. The performance of the branch and bound algorithm and the local search heuristics is assessed and supported by extensive computational tests...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} lot splitting {{in the context of}} workload control (WLC). Past studies on WLC assumed that jobs released to the shop floor proceed through the different stages of processing without being split.

This paper assesses the performance of different lot splitting policies for job release and dispatching strategies under lot splitting. A new dispatching rule was designed to specifically take advantage of lot splitting and operations overlapping in the context of WLC. Discrete-event simulation is used to assess system performance in relation to the ability to provide shorter delivery times and on time deliveries. Results highlight the importance of releasing the <b>sublots</b> of the same job together and demonstrate that combining an effective lot splitting policy with an appropriate dispatching rule can enhance the performance of production systems...|$|R

About 56. 91 % of the total carbon sequestration in forest vegetation is supported by the forest in the plain with an altitude of < 60 m and the low mountainous areas with an altitude from 400 m to 800 m. The carbon sequestration rate in forest vegetation is the highest in the plain area with an altitude of < 60 m and decreased significantly in the transitional area from the low plain to the low mountainous area with an altitude ranging from 200 m to 400 m due to intensive human disturbance.
