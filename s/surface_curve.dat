Optometrists may choose to specify a particular base curve when prescribing a corrective lens for either of these reasons. A multitude of mathematical formulas and professional clinical experience has allowed optometrists and lens designers to determine standard base curves that are ideal for most people. As a result, the front <b>surface</b> <b>curve</b> is more standardized and the characteristics that generate a person's unique prescription are typically derived from the geometry of the back surface of the lens.|$|E

The conversion formulae between the basis and the Bernstein basis are derived.

In particular, we derive the extended natural continuity conditions at coherent and/or incoherent surface curves modelling the phase interface. The continuity conditions allow one to establish the final position of the interface <b>surface</b> <b>curve</b> after the phase transition.

40|$|The surface {{modeling}} capability of CAD systems {{is widely used}} to design products bounded by free form <b>surfaces</b> and <b>curves.</b> However, the <b>surfaces</b> or <b>curves</b> generated by popular data fitting methods usually have shape imperfections such as wiggles.

The higher and lower concentrations of both factors resulted in lesser l-DOPA yield. The interaction between pH and l-tyrosine was found to highly significant because its solubility is decreases at neutral and alkaline conditions while l-tyrosine soluble at acidic conditions [11, 24]. The higher concentration of l-tyrosine inhibited the l-DOPA production due to its decreased solubility [10, 25].|$|E
