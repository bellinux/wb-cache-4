5000|$|In homes, {{the term}} [...] "student desk" [...] designates a small <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> or writing table {{constructed}} {{for use by}} a teenager or a pre-teen in their room. It often is a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk,</b> with {{only one of the}} two pedestals and about two thirds of the desk surface. Such desks are sometimes called [...] "left-pedestal desks" [...] and [...] "right-pedestal desks", depending on the position of the <b>single</b> <b>pedestal.</b> These <b>desks</b> are not as tall as normal adult desks. In some cases, the desk is connected from the seat to the table.|$|R

50|$|When the <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> form is cut {{to about}} {{two thirds of}} its normal width, {{and one of the}} {{pedestals}} is replaced by legs, this is then called a right <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> or a left <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk,</b> depending on the position of the pedestal. This kind of form is common for a student desk.|$|R

50|$|The C&O desk, {{constructed}} around 1920, is {{a walnut}} reproduction of an eighteenth-century English Georgian double <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> (also {{known as a}} partners desk) with drawers located {{on both sides of}} each pedestal.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pedestal</b> <b>desks</b> made {{of steel}} sheet metal were {{introduced}} in 1946 and were popular in America until the 1970s. Called tanker desks, they were used in institutions such as schools and business and government offices.|$|R

50|$|The desk {{shape is}} distinctive; its top part resembles an antique school desk while {{the bottom is}} like {{one half of the}} {{supports}} of a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> turned sideways. The addition of the two legs in front completes the odd effect.|$|R
50|$|A {{partners}} desk, partner's desk or partners' desk (also double desk) is {{an antique}} desk form, {{which is basically}} two <b>pedestal</b> <b>desks</b> constructed from the start as one large desk joined at the front, for two users working while facing each other.|$|R
50|$|Small or home {{offices are}} the usual habitat {{of the modern}} armoire desk. Corporations and {{government}} bureaucracies typically shun the armoire <b>desk,</b> preferring <b>pedestal</b> <b>desks</b> and cubicles in most instances. The closest ancestor, in form, of the armoire desk, is the Moore desk.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> {{is usually}} a large {{free-standing}} desk made of a simple rectangular working surface resting on two pedestals or small cabinets of stacked drawers {{of one or two}} sizes, with plinths around the bases. Often, there is also a central large drawer above the legs and knees of the user. Sometimes, especially in the 19th century and modern examples, a [...] "modesty panel" [...] is placed in front, between the pedestals, to hide the legs and knees of the user from anyone else sitting or standing in front. This variation is sometimes called a [...] "panel desk". The smaller and older <b>pedestal</b> <b>desks</b> with such a panel are sometimes called kneehole desks, and were usually placed against a wall.|$|R
50|$|For instance, a {{campaign}} desk {{version of a}} traditional <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> form would have strong but removable fittings {{making it easy to}} break up the desk in three pieces: two pedestals and one desktop surface. Each piece would have brass or iron handles mounted on it to facilitate handling.|$|R
5000|$|Baize is {{most often}} used on snooker and billiards tables to cover the [...] and , and is often used on other kinds of gaming tables such as those for blackjack, baccarat, craps and other casino games. It is also found as a writing surface, {{particularly}} on 19th century <b>pedestal</b> <b>desks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> appeared, {{especially}} in England, in the 18th century but became {{popular in the}} 19th and the 20th, overtaking the variants of the secretary desk and the writing table in sheer numbers. The French stayed faithful to the writing table or bureau plat ("flat desk"), which might have a matching paper-case (cartonnier) that stood upon it.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> is {{also one}} of the two {{principal}} forms of the big campaign desk, used by the military in the past. It can then be considered a portable desk in a limited way since the writing surface could be easily separated from the pedestals, to facilitate transport. The three separate elements were often fitted with large handles on the sides.|$|R
50|$|When a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> is {{doubled in}} size to form a nearly square working surface, and drawers are put on both sides to {{accommodate}} two users at the same time, it becomes a partners desk. Thomas Chippendale gives designs for such tables, which were generally used in libraries, as writing tables in The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director (1753-4 and 1762).|$|R
5000|$|Both prototypes require {{considerable}} work to {{be adapted}} to what most managers or professionals consider a [...] "real" [...] desk, that is a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk,</b> located in a closed office. They would also require rework and re-think to be adapted to the types of desks which are found in home offices or small business offices, such as the armoire desk.|$|R
50|$|This {{piece of}} {{furniture}} was first conceived in the United Kingdom to accommodate the work of banking partners. These gentlemen were usually senior bank officials who wished to work together while keeping the convenience and the prestige of a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk.</b> It was an adaptation of the earlier and sometimes larger library desk, found in the libraries of the mansions of the gentry and the nobility.|$|R
5000|$|Barby {{started working}} for a local firm in Rugby, before leaving to work in London in 1974. he was head hunted by Royal Leamington Spa-based auction house Locke and England, [...] and he joined them in 1978 as a manager and valuer. He later became a partner, {{retiring}} from the business in 2003. Barby was an expert on Victorian porcelain to Antique <b>Pedestal</b> <b>Desks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Very few non-specialists {{call this}} form a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk.</b> Most people usually {{refer to it}} as an {{executive}} desk, in contrast with the cubicle desk which is assigned to those who work under the executive. However, the term executive desk has been applied to so many desk forms as to be misleading, so the less-used but more precise [...] "pedestal desk" [...] has been retained here.|$|R

5000|$|From the mid-18th century onwards, the <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> {{has often}} had a top that is inlaid {{with a large}} panel of leather (sometimes with a gold- or blind-stamped border) or baize for a writing surface, within a cross-banded border. If the desk has a wooden top surface, it may have a {{pull-out}} lined writing drawer, or the pull-out may be fitted with a folding horse {{to serve as a}} [...]|$|R
50|$|An Indianapolis, Indiana, {{entrepreneur}} (who {{was later}} {{to become a}} Protestant preacher) called William S. Wooton obtained patents for his design and established a company in 1870. Production continued until about 1884. The Wooton desk is their better known secretary desk; the Wooton desk company also produced a so-called rotary desk, which {{is in fact a}} <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> whose <b>pedestals</b> have segments which turn on themselves to expose more drawers and nooks.|$|R
50|$|The bureau Mazarin is a 17th-century desk form named {{more or less}} {{in memory}} of Cardinal Mazarin, premier {{minister}} of France from 1642 to 1661. It is the earliest predecessor of the <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> and differs from it by having only two tiers of drawers or three tiers of rather small drawers under the desktop surface, followed by eight legs supporting the whole. Also, the bureau Mazarin has cross braces between the legs, forming two Xs or two Hs on each side.|$|R
50|$|There were {{at least}} two {{precursors}} to the pedestal desk: The French Bureau Mazarin (a desk named for Cardinal Mazarin) of the late 17th century and the Chinese Jumu desk or scholar's desk, which Europeans knew almost entirely at second-hand, largely from illustrations on porcelain. However, unlike the <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk,</b> these precursors had an incomplete stack of drawers and compartments holding up the two ends. The cases of drawers were raised about 15-30 cm (6-12 inches) from the floor on legs.|$|R
5000|$|A {{drawing board}} (also drawing table, {{drafting}} table or architect's table) is, in its antique form, {{a kind of}} multipurpose desk {{which can be used}} for any kind of drawing, writing or impromptu sketching on a large sheet of paper or for reading a large format book or other oversized document or for drafting precise technical illustrations (such as engineering drawings or architectural drawings). The drawing table used to be a frequent companion to a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> in a gentleman's study or private library, during the pre-industrial and early industrial era.|$|R
5000|$|A {{credenza}} desk (often simply, credenza) is {{a modern}} desk form usually placed next to a wall as a secondary work surface to that of another desk, such as a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk,</b> in a typical executive office. When used as an active work surface, the credenza desk is often placed against the wall immediately behind or perpendicular to the main desk, but close enough that the user can reach it from the seated position at the main desk by simply swivelling and wheeling their office chair over to it. When its planned use is to be less frequent, such as holding books or files which are not regularly referenced, or {{to act as an}} extra surface to help facilitate larger meetings, credenza desks are often placed on a wall in some other location of the office, such as adjacent to a conference table if one is present. Many conference rooms which have meeting tables but not desks will also have a credenza desk against one wall. The credenza desk is sometimes flat, like a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk,</b> {{but more often than not}} it has a stack of shelves, small drawers and other nooks, above its main working surface. The sum of these overhead amenities is usually called a hutch. Hence, the credenza desk is often called a [...] "credenza with hutch".|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{force platform}} is a {{plate with a}} <b>single</b> <b>pedestal,</b> instrumented as a load cell. Better designs have a pair of rectangular plates, although triangular can also work, one over another with load cells or triaxial force transducers between them at the corners.|$|R
5000|$|Very often {{a drawing}} table could {{look like a}} writing table or even a <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> when the working surface was set at the {{horizontal}} and the height adjusted to 29 inches, {{in order to use}} it as a [...] "normal" [...] desk. The only giveaway was usually a lip on one of the sides of the desktop. This lip or edge stopped paper or books from sliding when the surface was given an angle. It was also sometimes used to hold writing implements. When the working surface was extended at its full height, a drawing table could be used as a standing desk.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} armed with eight 10.5 cm K L/35 guns in <b>single</b> <b>pedestal</b> mounts, {{supplied}} with 765 {{rounds of ammunition}} in total. They had a range of 8200 m. Four guns were mounted on each broadside. The gun armament was rounded out by five 3.7 cm revolver cannon.|$|R
50|$|A {{rolltop desk}} is a 19th-century {{reworking}} of the <b>pedestal</b> <b>desk</b> with, in addition, {{a series of}} stacked compartments, shelves, drawers and nooks {{in front of the}} user, much like the bureau à gradin or the Carlton House desk. In contrast to these the compartments and the desktop surface of a rolltop desk can be covered by means of a tambour consisting of linked wooden slats that roll or slide through slots in the raised sides of the desk. In that, it is a descendant in function, and partly in form, of the cylinder desk of the 18th century. It is a relative of the tambour desk whose slats retract horizontally rather than vertically.|$|R
