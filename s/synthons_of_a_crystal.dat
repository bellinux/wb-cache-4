50|$|The {{reciprocal}} lattice plays {{a fundamental role in}} most analytic studies of periodic structures, {{particularly in the}} theory of diffraction. In neutron and X-ray diffraction due to the Laue conditions the momentum difference between incoming and diffracted X-rays <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crystal</b> is <b>a</b> {{reciprocal lattice}} vector. The diffraction pattern <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crystal</b> can be used to determine the reciprocal vectors of the lattice. Using this process, one can infer the atomic arrangement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crystal.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Desiraju's {{contribution}} {{to the subject of}} crystal engineering has focus on the concept <b>of</b> the supramolecular <b>synthon,</b> which is a small sub-structural unit that is an adequate enough representation of the entire <b>crystal</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> molecular solid. The major problem in crystal engineering is that the prediction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crystal</b> structure from <b>a</b> molecular structure is very difficult and not easily derivable from functional groups. Identification <b>of</b> supramolecular <b>synthons</b> simplifies this otherwise intractable problem. [...] The supramolecular synthon concept is now widely used by crystal engineers in the design of molecular crystals and pharmaceutical co-crystals, which are important from scientific and commercial viewpoints. Crystal engineering is effectively like supramolecular synthesis in the solid state, and there is a direct analogy between the supramolecular <b>synthon</b> <b>of</b> Desiraju and the molecular synthon that was proposed for organic synthesis by E. J. Corey.|$|R
