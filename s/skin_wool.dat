Again, just as flowers have been adapted to secure fertilisation or cross-fertilisation, fruits have been developed to assist in the dispersal of seeds; and their forms, sizes, juices, and colours can be shown to be specially adapted to secure such dispersal by the agency of birds and mammals; while the same end is secured in other cases by downy seeds to be wafted through the air, or by hooked or sticky seed-vessels to be carried away, attached to <b>skin,</b> <b>wool,</b> or feathers.|$|E

40|$|Small {{ruminants}} play {{an important}} role in the food and nutritional security of millions of rural people especially the landless, marginal and small farmers in arid and semiarid rainfed regions. The socio-economic value of small ruminant rearing as compared to other livestock species, for poor farmers is immense. Goat and sheep are also among the main meat-producing animals in India, whose meat (chevon/ mutton) is readily preferred irrespective of caste, creed and religion. They produce a variety of products, mainly meat, milk, <b>skin,</b> <b>wool</b> and manure and are especially useful in the semi-arid and arid regions, where they can sustain on sparse vegetation and extreme climatic conditions. Further, wherever irrigation facilities are poor, one can generally find large areas of waste and other common property land; on which the small ruminants of rural resource-poor households survive. A major part of their fodder requirement is met through such waste and other common property lands. It has been argued that these rural households have often developed highly efficient agricultural and livelihood systems that make the most rational and conservative use of the scarce resources available to them.

Wool strength is a heritable trait and varies widely between individuals even when they are maintained under equivalent conditions nutritionally. Consequently, it is valid to search for genetic markers of wool strength with the aim of using them in improving fleece quality. Wool strength is closely related to winter wool growth (Geenty et al. 1984). It is thought that the diminished follicle activity at this time reduces fibre diameter (Ross et al. 1965). This thesis investigates some of the mechanisms which may control wool growth. Such understanding will consequently aid a future search for genetic markers of wool strength. Blood plasma from eighty-six sheep was assayed for a number of metabolites and growth factors including glucose, urea, Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate, creatinine, insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, growth hormone, cortisol and melatonin. A correlation was observed between elevated plasma insulin and reduced plasma glucose and wool strength. Some changes in peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin were also found. For example, in an indoor treatment high wool strength animals showed some peripheral tissue resistance to insulin. These data suggest that the control of and/ or mechanisms of glucose uptake vary between high and low wool strength animals. Insulin binding by the skin was investigated. No significant differences in insulin receptor binding were found between the skin of high and low wool strength animals. Although it is possible that differences could have been masked by the variable nature of the data, the evidence available from this and previous studies suggest that highly variable insulin binding between individuals by ovine tissues is a 'normal' observation. The lack of correlation between insulin receptor binding and wool strength was consequently thought to be real. Differences in tissue sensitivity to insulin were therefore hypothesised to lie with a post-receptor mechanism. The expression of glucose transporters 1 and 4 was assessed in tissues of high and low wool strength sheep using human cDNA probes. Appropriate human cDNA probes were also used to evaluate the expression of the insulin and insulin-like growth factor I receptor genes and the gene for ribosomal protein S 6. Except for the ribosomal protein S 6 gene, low to nil expression of these genes was observed in all the tissues examined when compared to the constitutively expressed B-actin gene. Expression could not be stimulated by chronic (5 hour) insulin infusion. Low expression was not thought to be due solely to a lack of homology between ovine and human sequences suggesting the expression of genes involved in glucose uptake is extremely low in sheep. The glucose transporter 1 gene was expressed at low levels in <b>skin,</b> <b>wool</b> follicles and brain tissue but not in muscle and fat tissue. This suggests that skin, like brain tissue, has an absolute requirement for glucose, a situation not found in adipose and muscle tissue. Glucose transporter I is generally reported to be associated with non-insulin dependent glucose uptake. From this it was concluded that elucidation of the mechanisms by which glucose is taken up into different tissues provides the key to understanding the controlling factors by which glucose is partitioned to the wool follicle. Such a mechanism could be influenced by insulin either directly by its action on the wool follicle, or indirectly, by causing insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissues which partitions glucose to the skin where it is taken up in an insulin-independent manner...|$|E
40|$|Africa is well-endowed with {{a diverse}} range of {{livestock}} breeds and strains of various species which are vital to the subsistence and economic Development of the continent. They provide year-round flow of essential products, sustain the employment and income {{of millions of people}} and contribute draught power and manure for crop production. In the rural areas, livestock are an important source of food and cash, and hence are crucial for the purchase of consumer goods and procurement of farm inputs. They also supply such non-food items as hides, <b>skins,</b> <b>wool,</b> transportation and fuel (from dung), convert crop residues and fibre materials of no value into protein of high quality, serve as a store of wealth and as a means of meeting various social obligations in traditional society and are a major source of revenue and export earnings for many countries.

40|$|During {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{significant}} increase in industrial anthrax among workers handling imported wool and hair. In some areas this increase has assumed the proportions of a minor epidemic. This trend is reflected in the statistics from one state alone in which a total of 24 cases of industrial anthrax were reported from January 1 to September 30, 1949. Although all of these cases occurred in the carpet-manufacturing industry, 22 of them were confined to a single plant. An urgent need has thus been demonstrated for the development of effective, nondeleterious methods for the disinfection of imported animal prod-ucts. In a 20 -year survey on the incidence of anthrax in the United States for the period from 1919 to 1938, Smyth (1939) reported a total of 1, 683 recorded cases. Of this number, hides, <b>skins,</b> <b>wool,</b> and hair were responsible for 754 cases.

40|$|Wool {{production}} {{differences between}} sheep maintained under similar environmental conditions appear {{to reside in}} the functioning of individual follicles. The investigations presented in this thesis utilise the differing wool producing abilities of two strains of Merino, finewool and strongwool Merinos. The relationships between wool production (on both a unit area and individual follicle basis) and skin and follicle characteristics, blood flow and microvasculature of the skin and incorporation of ¬≥H-glucose and ¬≥‚ÅµS-cystine by the skin were examined. The differences in the structure and function of wool follicles and their association with fibre production were examined in 6 finewool Merinos (Camden Park) and 6 strongwool Merinos (East Bungaree). The strongwool Merinos produced 2. 4 times more wool per unit area of skin and 3. 5 times the volume of fibre per follicle than the finewool Merinos, when both groups were maintained under similar environmental conditions. The finewool Merinos had a higher follicle density, but a lower average volume of germinative tissue in the follicle bulb and the skin than the strongwool Merinos. The rate of cell production in the follicle bulb was greater in the strongwool Merinos than the finewool Merinos, but the proportion of bulb cells entering the fibre was not significantly different between strains. The number and volume of cells in the bulb and the cell length and volume of the cortical cells, and tended to be greater in the strongwool Merinos than the finewool Merinos, but also were not statistically different between strains due to a high 'between-sheep, within-strain' variation. Wool {{production per unit area}} of skin was highly correlated with the total volume of germinative tissue in the skin (r = 0. 91; P < 0. 01). This relationship was true for the strongwool and finewool Merinos and also in two groups of sheep from the same genetic base with one group selected using a WOOLPLAN index and the other a randomly-bred flock. It was concluded a) that genotype may determine the volume of potential mitotically-active follicle tissue in the skin, and b) that wool production on both a follicle and unit area of skin basis is not controlled by a single character, but rather {{is the result of a}} cumulative effect of a number of characteristics. The physiology of the skin associated with high levels of wool production was further examined. In particular, blood flow through the skin of the strongwool and finewool Merinos was investigated using a laser Doppler velocimeter. This method was highly correlated with estimates obtained using ‚Åµ‚Å∑Co-microspheres (r = 0. 92;P < 0. 01) although the absolute values estimated by the microsphere technique were significantly greater (P < 0. 001). Strongwool Merinos had a significantly greater rate of blood flowing through the skin than finewool Merinos (P < 0. 011) and this was associated both with wool production per unit area of skin (r = 0. 58; P < 0. 02) and with follicle density (r = - 0. M; P < 0. 1). It was concluded that a) blood flow has an important role in the level of wool produced both within and between strains of Merino, and b) the laser Doppler velocimeter is a useful tool for the study of blood flow in the skin of sheep. The microvasculature of the skin was examined using an infusion of silicone rubber into the deep circumflex iliac artery within the abdominal flank region of eight Merinos. The area of cascular tissue per unit volume of skin was independent of blood flow, wool growth and follicle density, both within and between strains of Merinos. The limitations of the technique used to examine the microvasculature, and its effect on the results are discussed. The uptake of ¬≥H-glucose and ¬≥‚ÅµS-cystine by the skin and follicles was examined both in vitro and in vivo to determine if the follicles of the strongwool Merinos were capable of utilising the large nutrient pool supplied by the high rates of blood flowing through the skin. The skin and follicles of strongwool Merinos incorporate similar amounts of ¬≥H-glucose and ¬≥‚ÅµS-cystine per unit weight of skin than finewool Merinos. It was also found that the amount of radioactivity retained by the skin generally was not dependant on the amount of radioactivity supplied to the skin and follicles. In summary, this study determined that strongwool Merinos have higher levels of wool production than finewool Merinos due to the presence of a large amount of tissue capable of producing fibre. This characteristic is maintained by a high rate of blood flowing through the <b>skin.</b> <b>Wool</b> production and blood flow through the skin are not influenced by the underlying anatomy of the microvasculature, nor is wool production restricted by the ability of the follicles to utilise nutrients from an extracellular pool for fibre production. Finally, the implications of this study and the usefulness in, and effect on, programs for selection of superior wool-producing genotypes are discussed. Thesis (Ph. D.)

30|$|Nomadism was the opposite. In the nomadic economy, animals live on grass, which grows {{naturally}} {{from the}} ground.
