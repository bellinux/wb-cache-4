40|$|Metabolic bone disease {{encompasses}} {{a number of}} disorders that tend to present a generalized involvement of the <b>whole</b> <b>skeleton.</b> The disorders are mostly related to increased bone turnover and increased uptake of radiolabelled diphosphonate. Skeletal uptake of 99 mTc-labelled diphosphonate depends pri-marily upon osteoblastic activity, {{and to a lesser}} extent, skeletal vascularity. A bone scan image therefore presents a functional display of total skeletal metabolism and has valuable role to play in the assessment of patients with metabolic bone disor-ders. However, the bone scan appearances in metabolic bone disease are often non-specific, and their recognition depends on increased tracer uptake throughout the <b>whole</b> <b>skeleton.</b> It is the presence of local lesions, as in metastatic disease, that makes a bone scan appearance obviously abnormal. In the early stages, there will be difficulty in evaluating the bone scans from many patients with metabolic bone disease. However, in the more severe cases scan appearances can be quite striking and virtually diagnostic. KEY words: metabolic bone disease, superscan, focal uptake, 99 mTc diphosphonat...|$|R

To assess this, serial studies were evaluated and quantified in ten postmenopausal women with osteoporosis treated with teriparatide (20 μg/day subcutaneous) who had 99 m Tc-methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scans (baseline, 3 and 18 months, then after 6 months off therapy). Methods Women were injected with 600 MBq 99 m Tc-MDP, and diagnostic bone scan images were assessed at 3. 5 h. Additional whole-body scans (10 min, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h) were analysed for 99 m Tc-MDP skeletal plasma clearance (Kbone). Regional Kbone differences were obtained for the <b>whole</b> <b>skeleton</b> and six regions (calvarium, mandible, spine, pelvis, upper and lower extremities). Bone turnover markers (BTM) were also measured. Results Most subjects showed visual changes on 3 - and 18 month bone scan images that disappeared after 6 months off therapy. Enhanced uptake was seen predominantly in the calvarium and lower extremities. <b>Whole</b> <b>skeleton</b> Kbone displayed a median increase of 22 % (3 months, p= 0. 004) and 34 % (18 months, p= 0. 002) decreasing to 0. 7 % (6 months off therapy).

When the polypes formed by budding or division remain associated, the polypidom is sometimes made up of nothing but an aggregation of these cups, while at other times the cups are at once separated and held together, by an intermediate substance, which represents the branches of the red coral. The red coral polype again is a comparatively rare animal, inhabiting a limited area, the skeleton of which has but a very insignificant mass; while the white corals are very common, occur in almost all seas, and form skeletons which are sometimes extremely massive.|$|R
