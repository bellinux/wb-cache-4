Population densities of R 20 (NAH 7) were also enhanced in salicylate-amended soil, increasing from approximately 1 × 105 CFU/g to approximately 3 × 108 CFU/g after 35 h of incubation. In contrast, population densities of R 20 (NAH 7) in nonamended soil were approximately 3 × 106 CFU/g of soil after 35 h of incubation. The concentration of salicylate in soil affected the rate and extent of population increase by R 20 (NAH 7). At 50 to 250 μg of salicylate per g of soil, population densities of R 20 (NAH 7) increased to approximately 108 CFU/g of soil by 48 h of incubation, with the fastest increase at 100 μg/g.

Furthermore, no great increase in quantity of production can be expected. The long, relatively mild winters with temperatures favorable to development of the reproductive phase of growth in the sugar beet have made the Willamette Valley of Oregon one of the two chief <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>seed</b> producing areas of the United States. Because it is the place offering the best opportunity for total or complete reproduction in all varieties, the Willamette Valley is the foremost producer of seed of bolting resistant varieties of sugar beets. For the same reason, it is the most prominent place for producing seed breeders' elite and stock seed for increase. It is probable that these aspects of the United States <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>seed</b> industry will remain localized to the Willamette Valley. The Willamette Valley has ample land on which sugar beets for seed could be raised should demand for seed ever warrant expansion. Sugar beets for seed compete favorably with other crops grown on the Valley's best soils; the present situation indicates that the same kind of competition could be carried to any suitable part of the Valley. With the only slight expansion now taking place, localization within the Willamette Valley will likely remain within a radius of 30 to 40 miles of Salem, and principally on a north -south axis on the more suitable alluvial soils...|$|E

Four varieties of <b>sugar</b> <b>beets</b> were studied: Colibri, Evita, Kawetina, and Maria. Their seeds were biostimulated during free falling with divergent He-Ne laser beams (40 mW), placed one upon another. The experiments were conducted ace. to the split-plot method in 3 repetitions. Before the harvesting, 20 plants were measured biometrically for the length of leaves, weight of leaves, sticking out of roots over the surface of soil, length, weight, diameter, and circumference of roots. During the harvest, the yield of roots and leaves was specified and after the harvest the chemical analysis was made to check the plant dry mass, the content of sugar, soluble ash, alpha-amine nitrogen, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu.

Lime (CaCO₃), nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilizer applications were made to <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>seed</b> plots at two locations in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. Seed produced from each treatment was examined by radiography to determine the percentage of fruits containing underdeveloped seeds.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of three different inoculation methods with selected Azotobacter chroococcum strains on productive and technological traits of sugar beet, as well as on the total number of microorganisms and azotobacter in rhizosphere. The results of this two-year study showed that effectiveness of the tested inoculation methods in increasing root yield and sugar content varies greatly, depending on year and azotobacter strains. Effectiveness of inoculation methods was not largely impacted by year on granulated sugar. Achieved granulated sugar yield was significantly higher by using pre-sowing azotobacter application, than by using seed inoculation. A significantly increased number of microorganisms in sugar beet rhizosphere was determined, not only by using pre-sowing azotobacter application but also by using <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>seed</b> inoculation. Pre-sowing azotobacter application and inter-row cultivation both caused an equal increase in the number of these bacteria in sugar beet rhizosphere (42. 2 % and 46. 9 %).

40|$|The {{production}} of cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) with antifungal and biosurfactant properties by Pseudomonas fluorescens strains {{was investigated in}} bulk soil and in the <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> rhizosphere. Purified CLPs (viscosinamide, tensin, and amphisin) were first shown to remain highly stable and extractable (90 %) when applied (ca. 5 μg g− 1) to sterile soil, whereas all three compounds were degraded over 1 to 3 weeks in nonsterile soil. When a whole-cell inoculum of P. fluorescens strain DR 54 containing a cell-bound pool of viscosinamide {{was added to the}} nonsterile soil, declining CLP concentrations were observed over a week. By comparison, addition of the strains 96. 578 and DSS 73 without cell-bound CLP pools did not result in detectable tensin or amphisin in the soil. In contrast, when <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>seeds</b> were coated with the CLP-producing strains and subsequently germinated in nonsterile soil, strain DR 54 maintained a high and constant viscosinamide level in the young rhizosphere for ∼ 2 days while strains 96. 578 and DSS 73 exhibited significant production (net accumulation) of tensin or amphisin, reaching a maximum level after 2 days. All three CLPs remained detectable for several days in the rhizosphere. Subsequent tests of five other CLP-producing P. fluorescens strains also demonstrated significant production in the young rhizosphere. The results thus provide evidence that {{production of}} different CLPs is a common trait among many P. fluorescens strains in the soil environment, and further, that the production is taking place only in specific habitats like the rhizosphere of germinating <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>seeds</b> rather than in the bulk soil...|$|R

40|$|Polymyxa betae is an obbligate {{intracellular}} parassite and vector of Beet Necrotic Yellow Vein Virus, {{agent of}} rhizomania, an extremely severe disease of sugar beet. 2, 4 -Diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) {{is a wide}} spectrum antibacterial and antifungal antibiotic and a major determinant in the biological control of several plant diseases. It is produced by many strains of Pseudomonas both in vitro and in the rhizosphere of crop plants. It has previously demonstrated that DAPG and P. fluorescens F 113 Rif pCUGP, a genetically modified strain iperproducing DAPG, is able to inhibit viability of P. betae zoospore and resting spore in microcosm. In this work the protection efficacy of synthetic DAPG {{has been compared to}} that provided by GM-Pseudomonas, taking also into account the bacterial colonization levels obtained and the possible phytotoxic effect of DAPG, both in microcosm and in field. In microcom experiments, at the lowest concentrations still affecting P. betae viability, synthetic DAPG showed phytotoxic effect that inhibits, in some extent, <b>sugar</b> <b>beet</b> <b>seed</b> germination and plant growth. In the same condition, P. fluorescens F 113 Rif pCUGP efficiently colonized sugar beet rhizosphere producing a clear protection (although minor if compared with synthetic DAPG effect) against rhizomania.

The effects of harvesting procedures on seed development and germination were compared {{at the various}} stages of maturity using simulated direct and windrow methods. Maturity as determined by maximum germination and dry seed weight occurred at 40, 43 and 45 days after anthesis for the three years studied. Heat units accumulated from anthesis to maturity remained constant for all three years, even though 1965 was much warmer. It was concluded that the seed on sugar beet plants should be mature after 900 heat units are attained or 45 days after peak anthesis. The primary factor lowering the germination potential of mature seed was the occurrence of underdeveloped seeds, Chemical inhibitors in the sugar beet fruits as measured by firm ungerminated seeds may also reduce the germination for seed collected prior to maturity. Some seeds were capable of germination 20 days after anthesis. Plants and seeds of the hard bolting variety remained green throughout the maturation period, whereas easy bolting plants reached senesence and shattered.
