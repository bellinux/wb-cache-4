Hawksbills captured (N =  82) were exclusively juveniles and subadults with a <b>straight</b> <b>standard</b> carapace length (SSCL) ranging from 21. 4 to 69. 0 cm {{with a mean of}} 44. 1 cm (SD =  10. 8).

Analysis of 740 base pair mitochondrial control region sequences from 50 sampled turtles yielded 12 haplotypes. Haplotype frequencies were significantly different compared to four other Caribbean juvenile foraging aggregations, including one off the Atlantic coast of Florida. Many-to-one mixed stock analysis indicated Mexico as the primary source of juveniles in the region and also suggested that the Refuge may serve as important developmental habitat for the Cuban nesting aggregation. Serum testosterone radioimmunoassay results from 33 individuals indicated a female biased sex ratio of 3. 3 females: 1 male for hawksbills in the Refuge. This assemblage of hawksbills is near the northern limit of the species range, and is one of only two such assemblages described in the waters of the continental United States.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{effect of}} {{hydroxyapatite}} (HA) coating on the fixation of a cementless femoral stem is discussed, {{in particular in}} cases of primary fixation with geometrically stable components. Therefore, we performed a comparative retrospective study {{of a series of}} Alloclassic-SL™ stems to: 1) present the long-term results and 2) evaluate the contribution, if any, of proximal HA coating. HypothesesLong-term cementless press-fit (“flat wedge-shaped”) fixation is reliable and HA coating only improves the radiological results of the proximal bone-prosthesis interface. Materials and MethodsOne hundred and ninety-eight Alloclassic total hip arthroplasties were performed in 179 patients, mean age 66  years old (22 – 85), including 105 with proximal HA coating and 93 with the original grit-blast coating. One hundred and ninety-three hips were analyzed after a mean follow-up of 9. 8  years (1 – 24  years). ResultsResults were excellent or good in 184  hips (95 %) with {{no significant difference between the}} 2  groups (Merle d’Aubigné≥ 16 for 89 / 92 (98 %) without HA compared to 95 / 101 (94 %) with HA P= 0. 59). Radiographic signs of stable osseointegration were observed in 173  hips (90 % of the cases). HA coating significantly improved the radiographic results of the proximal bone-implant interface: (42 / 92 (46 %) of the stems without HA had proximal radiolucencies in zones  1 and 7 compared to 4 / 101 (4 %) with HA (P= 0. 0001)). Polyethylene wear> 0. 1  mm/year was observed in 6  hips (3 %) including 1 / 101 (1 %) in the group with HA versus 5 / 92 (5. 4 %) without HA (P= 0. 17). One intra-operative femoral fracture occurred and there were 9  dislocations in the first 3  postoperative months (4. 5 %). The main cause of revision surgery was recurrent dislocation (11 / 17  cases). The “revision per- 100 observed-femoral component years” was 0. 10 in both groups and survival for aseptic loosening of the stem was 100 % (95 % CI= 73. 2 % to 100 %) at 20  years. ConclusionThis study shows that secondary fixation by osseointegration of a <b>straight</b> <b>standard</b> grit-blasted titanium alloy non-anatomical implant is reliable. Possible proximal fibrous encapsulation, which is reduced by HA coating, but especially conventional polyethylene wear, were the main limitations of this system.

40|$|This Guideline is an {{official}} {{statement of the}} European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). It provides practical {{advice on how to}} achieve successful cannulation and sphincterotomy at minimum risk to the patient. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was adopted to define the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. Main recommendations 1 ESGE suggests that difficult biliary cannulation is defined by the presence of {{one or more of the}} following: more than 5 contacts with the papilla whilst attempting to cannulate; more than 5 minutes spent attempting to cannulate following visualization of the papilla; more than one unintended pancreatic duct cannulation or opacification (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). 2 ESGE recommends the guidewire-assisted technique for primary biliary cannulation, since it reduces the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis (moderate quality evidence, strong recommendation). 3 ESGE recommends using pancreatic guidewire (PGW) -assisted biliary cannulation in patients where biliary cannulation is difficult and repeated unintentional access to the main pancreatic duct occurs (moderate quality evidence, strong recommendation). ESGE recommends attempting prophylactic pancreatic stenting in all patients with PGW-assisted attempts at biliary cannulation (moderate quality evidence, strong recommendation). 4 ESGE recommends needle-knife fistulotomy as the preferred technique for precutting (moderate quality evidence, strong recommendation). ESGE suggests that precutting should be used only by endoscopists who achieve selective biliary cannulation in more than 80  % of cases using standard cannulation techniques (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). When access to the pancreatic duct is easy to obtain, ESGE suggests placement of a pancreatic stent prior to precutting (moderate quality evidence, weak recommendation). 5 ESGE recommends that in patients with a small papilla that is difficult to cannulate, transpancreatic biliary sphincterotomy should be considered if unintentional insertion of a guidewire into the pancreatic duct occurs (moderate quality evidence, strong recommendation). In patients who have had transpancreatic sphincterotomy, ESGE suggests prophylactic pancreatic stenting (moderate quality evidence, strong recommendation). 6 ESGE recommends that mixed current is used for sphincterotomy rather than pure cut current alone, as there is a decreased risk of mild bleeding with the former (moderate quality evidence, strong recommendation). 7 ESGE suggests endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EPBD) as an alternative to endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) for extracting CBD stones <  8  mm in patients without anatomical or clinical contraindications, especially in the presence of coagulopathy or altered anatomy (moderate quality evidence, strong recommendation). 8 ESGE does not recommend routine biliary sphincterotomy for patients undergoing pancreatic sphincterotomy, and suggests that it is reserved for patients in whom there is evidence of coexisting bile duct obstruction or biliary sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (moderate quality evidence, weak recommendation). 9 In patients with periampullary diverticulum (PAD) and difficult cannulation, ESGE suggests that pancreatic duct stent placement followed by precut sphincterotomy or needle-knife fistulotomy are suitable options to achieve cannulation (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). ESGE suggests that EST is safe in patients with PAD. In cases where EST is technically difficult to complete as a result of a PAD, large stone removal can be facilitated by a small EST combined with EPBD or use of EPBD alone (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). 10 For cannulation of the minor papilla, ESGE suggests using wire-guided cannulation, with or without contrast, and sphincterotomy with a pull-type sphincterotome or a needle-knife over a plastic stent (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). When cannulation of the minor papilla is difficult, ESGE suggests secretin injection, which can be preceded by methylene blue spray in the duodenum (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). 11 In patients with choledocholithiasis who are scheduled for elective cholecystectomy, ESGE suggests intraoperative ERCP with laparoendoscopic rendezvous (moderate quality evidence, weak recommendation). ESGE suggests that when biliary cannulation is unsuccessful with a standard retrograde approach, anterograde guidewire insertion either by a percutaneous or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) -guided approach can be used to achieve biliary access (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). 12 ESGE suggests that in patients with Billroth II gastrectomy ERCP should be performed in referral centers, with the side-viewing endoscope as a first option; forward-viewing endoscopes are the second choice in cases of failure (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). A <b>straight</b> <b>standard</b> ERCP catheter or an inverted sphincterotome, with or without the guidewire, is recommended by ESGE for biliopancreatic cannulation in patients who have undergone Billroth II gastrectomy (low quality evidence, strong recommendation). Endoscopic papillary ballon dilation (EPBD) is suggested as an alternative to sphincterotomy for stone extraction in the setting of patients with Billroth II gastrectomy (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). In patients with complex post-surgical anatomy ESGE suggests referral to a center where device-assisted enteroscopy techniques are available (very low quality evidence, weak recommendation...|$|E

40|$|HMM-based speech {{synthesis}} offers {{a way to}} generate speech with different voice qualities. However, sometimes databases contain certain inherent voice qualities {{that need to be}} parametrized properly. One example of this is vocal fry typically occurring at the end of utterances. A popular mixed excitation vocoder for HMM-based {{speech synthesis}} is <b>STRAIGHT.</b> The <b>standard</b> <b>STRAIGHT</b> is optimized for modal voices and may not produce high quality with other voice types. Fortunately, due to the flexibility of STRAIGHT, different F 0 and aperiodicity measures can be used in the synthesis without any inherent degradations in speech quality. We have replaced the STRAIGHT excitation with a representation based on a robust F 0 measure and a carefully determined two-band voicing. According to our analysis-synthesis experiments, the new parameterization can improve the speech quality. In HMM-based speech synthesis, the quality is significantly improved especially due to the better modeling of vocal fry.

40|$|Thermal {{management}} for high performance of miniaturized electronic devices using microchannel heat sinks has recently become {{of interest to}} researchers and industry. Obtaining heat sink designs with uniform flow distribution is strongly desired. Mal-distribution in a <b>standard</b> <b>straight</b> microchannel heat sink has become a problematic issue in this research area. A cross-linking scheme, introduced in the channel core promises an appropriate {{solution to this problem}} due to flow sharing through the cross-links. In the present thesis, a number of experimental and numerical studies have been conducted to seek appropriate designs for microchannel heat sinks. The effects of cross links, introduced in the channel core of an array of parallel scaled microchannels, are investigated, by comparing the flow distribution and pressure drop in six different multi-channel configurations. A <b>standard</b> <b>straight</b> channel test section and five cross-linked test sections are experimentally investigated. All test sections have 45 parallel rectangular channels, with a hydraulic diameter of 1. 59 mm. The flow distribution is monitored at four selected channels. The working mixture is air and water with superficial velocities ranging from 0. 03 to 9. 93 m/s, and 0. 04 to 0. 83 m/s, respectively. The results show that the cross-linked designs improve the flow distribution between channels compared to the <b>standard</b> <b>straight</b> channel configuration. Flow patterns obtained from flow visualization are presented in terms of fractional time function and a flow pattern map was developed. Compared with a single channel flow regime map, the expected intermittent flow regime is observed 84 % to 90 % of the time for the cross-linked designs, but only 65 % to 80 % of that for the straight channel design. A new cross-linked microchannel heat sink is proposed with the support of numerical investigations. The new design shows a significant improvement, up to 55 %, on flow distribution when compared to the <b>standard</b> <b>straight</b> channel configuration without a penalty in pressure drop...|$|R

An accurate three-dimensional numerical method is proposed, based on the immersed boundary technique. The method accounts for the interactions between the flow and the motion of the rigid leaflets and of the deformable aortic root, under physiological pulsatile conditions.
