I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be.

2500|$|A Chicago house album, Virgos music draws {{elements}} {{from the local}} deep house and acid house styles, and bears influence and similitaries {{with the work of}} Larry Heard, Fingers Inc. and Armando. Parallelisms can be established between its [...] "futuristic grooves" [...] and other contemporary dance styles such as techno and Balearic beat. However, Virgo has been noted for its idiosyncratic sound, more introspective and dreamy than other mechanically intense styles from its era, Phuture's [...] "Acid Trax" [...] for example. In a 2009 interview, Merwyn Sanders stated: [...] "We were into a lot of classic stuff, Kraftwerk and Gary Numan and a lot of jazz stuff. That’s what I grew up around, listening. My dad was a huge jazz fan, so that was just engrained in my head without me even knowing it. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that’s what <b>you</b> get a little sense of with that album we did." [...] Fact called it a [...] "deep post-acid" [...] album, and wrote that despite being similar to other contemporary house releases, [...] "it stands alone, and its cerebral but generously groovy evocation of the urban nightscape has never been matched for elegance or acuity." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described it as [...] "music you might make the day after a drugged-out bacchanal – wistful and contemplative, shot through with a creeping, contagious melancholy." [...] Joe Muggs described Virgo as [...] "archetypal house music through and through: it is design {{as much as it is}} art, absolutely attuned to the proportions and metabolism of the human body in a technological society." [...] He also noted that despite the [...] "soulfulness and the spindly stripping down of its production", the album is not [...] "less powerful than noisier, bassier or thicker music." ...|$|R

50|$|Gallagher {{claims that}} he was drunk while writing the song. According to him, parts of the song were {{inspired}} by walking while listening to a Walkman ("walking {{to the sound of}} my favourite tune") and using cocaine ("all your dreams are made / when you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade"), since razors are often used to cut cocaine into lines on a mirror, from which they are then snorted.

5000|$|You {{guys are}} neither a Straight Edge or a Christian band, but you often get labeled as such.

Then there's me who doesn't smoke, drink or do drugs. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> could call me SXE, but I don't usually say anything. It's just {{something}} I've always been.

5000|$|Many {{point to}} this album - and particularly, the song [...] "Milk" [...] - {{as one of}} the first songs to feature a blast beat, {{courtesy}} of Benante. When asked in 2009 if he invented the blast beat, Benante replied, [...] "If you mean that I decided to sit in my room and invent it, no it wasn’t like that. The thing was something that had been around the NY hardcore scene for ages but hadn’t been used for other things. The first time it really happened was on S.O.D’s ‘Milk’ song, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> could say I had a lot to do with it.

5000|$|With Aukerman's {{departure}} {{announced in}} advance, Stevenson {{took the opportunity}} to relaunch the band afresh under the name All with singer Dave Smalley, formerly of the Washington, D.C. hardcore band Dag Nasty, meaning for the new band to be the complete fulfillment of the [...] "All" [...] concept. [...] "I've been wanting to change the name of the band to ALL for eight years", he said during the FinALL tour, adding that it would not feel right to continue as the Descendents without Aukerman and that he wished to shelve the name in case he and Aukerman should wish to use it again at some point. On December 16, 1987, during the recording of the first All album Allroy Sez, Pat McCuistion died when his fishing boat sank during a storm.

5000|$|Their third studio album, called Broken Frames, was {{released}} on June 8, 2010. The first single from the album is called [...] "All You Ever Knew", and {{was released}} on April 1, 2010 on revolvermag.com and on their MySpace page. Brandon Anderson had resigned from the band, and [...] "quit for a girl, but it wasn't just that. He really damaged his vocal chords and he can't scream anymore," [...] band member Caleb says. Frontwoman Alexia said of the album, [...] "I {{have a lot of}} memories that I want to forget about. So I wanted to base the theme of the song on that feeling. I have had a friend pass away; I have broken hearts; I have lost faith at times; and I have made mistakes that I can’t even count anymore. So all of the memories of these things inspired me to write about them on this album. We really wanted this first song to be the heaviest and the most evolved sounding track compared to the tracks on The World Outside. 'Broken Frames' is the first song we finished for this record and the first song we tried out this theme on. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> could call this a concept album about everything I want to forget." [...] The song [...] "Ryan" [...] is about Alexia's guitar teacher, who taught her almost everything she knows. She says [...] "he was always a happy person, but not in the inside I guess." [...] One day she went in for lessons, he wasn't there and she later found out he had shot himself in the chest. So she really just wanted to write a song about him.

40|$|Brokers scan stock projections. Corporations {{live for}} the next quarter. Families plan budgets so they can afford a summer vacation. Multinationals seek modern soothsayers to help decide whether to sell smaller {{roasting}} pans. Hi-tech firms hire specialists to predict whether tomorrow 2 ̆ 7 s workers will demand in-office day care. For many {{so much as a}} glimpse of what the future holds, government at all levels spends millions. Call it a human condition, this hankering after the future. 2 ̆ 2 You 2 ̆ 7 ve really got a great gimmick, 2 ̆ 2 an envious Virginia Commonwealth University colleague once quipped to futurologist Howard Ozmon. 2 ̆ 2 Everything has a future, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> 2 ̆ 7 ll always be in business. 2 ̆ 2 Indeed, there 2 ̆ 7 s a virtual bull market in futures out there [...] at least 2, 000 full-time professional prognosticators and more than 200 research groups busily plumbing the future for everything from foreign troop strengths and famine to deforestation and dental floss. We 2 ̆ 7 re not talking palm readers. And we 2 ̆ 7 re not talking peanuts. The futures industry pulls in more than 10 million each year from corporate and government clients [...] the sort of success that even futurologists, the handful of them who were around a few decades ago, couldn 2 ̆ 7 t foresee. And comes now the new year, which means future-analysts are booked solid, cranking out forecasts just as soon as their computers can spit out the numbers. 2 ̆ 2 Business [...] indeed, life [...] is like a chess game. Those who play skillfully look ahead a few moves, 2 ̆ 2 explains Joseph L. Fisher, secretary of human resources and no stranger to Future Fever. 2 ̆ 2 Some of this looking at the future is hairbrained, visionary and impractical, but {{a lot of it has}} become quite technical. And so vital that it can be perilous to make decisions without it, 2 ̆ 2 says Fisher. Two years ago, Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s own boss saw the virtue of future-glancing, as several other governors in other states had done. So Gov. Charles S. Robb urged a 37 -member bipartisan panel to look at Virginia in the 21 st century. The group [...] no mere assortment of supermarket-tabloid astrologers, what with a former secretary of defense, retired chief justice and several corporate executives aboard [...] has reported its findings. Some of the forecasts are so significant they could result in legislative action as early as next year. But the Robb commission 2 ̆ 7 s view of a 2 ̆ 2 New Dominion 2 ̆ 2 was only part of a trend that is sweeping the land. Nothing is too grandiose or too insignificant to escape the divining instruments of these modern-day soothsayers, who use computers instead of crystal balls and 2 ̆ 2 trend extrapolation 2 ̆ 2 instead of palms. And who usually come up with a whopper of a bill. (For a study on the feasibility of solar power in the 1970 s, a large West Coast think tank charged Uncle Sam 275, 000.) Another think tank [...] in a 10 -year forecast that partly considered the fate of dental floss among lower income families [...] predicted that, in the future, 2 ̆ 2 an increasing proportion of males may not wear underpants because trousers can be washed easily and often. 2 ̆ 2 Less outrageous was the formulation during the 1939 World 2 ̆ 7 s Fair, that picture phones would sweep the land. The experts were right about that technology; wrong about consumer demand. Then, during the 1950 s, there was talk of tourists on safari in war-torn Vietnam [...] predicted for the 1960 s. Close, but most futurologists then failed to predict the energy crisis. Time and again, forecasting has failed. Many forecasters have simply built up a dismal record [...] one which won 2 ̆ 7 t likely improve. Some predictions have led economist Lester Thurow, among others, to conclude that futures research is 2 ̆ 2 the intellectual 2 ̆ 7 s version of going to the palm reader. 2 ̆ 2 Government has had its share of soothsaying snafus. In 1980, experts predicted that the United States could become energy independent by using certain minerals. There was one slight catch: America didn 2 ̆ 7 t have enough of the minerals. Then, there 2 ̆ 7 s the fish story. During the Carter Administration, some specialists foresaw that, as the human population grew, greater numbers of fish would be caught. One problem: other experts concluded there weren 2 ̆ 7 t any more fish that could be caught. This is to say nothing of the complaints over America 2 ̆ 7 s weathermen. Which leads to a basic question: Just how reliable is any of this multi-million dollar, high-tech prognosticating? 2 ̆ 2 We 2 ̆ 7 ve come a long way since science fiction, H. G. Wells and the speculations of Nostradamus, 2 ̆ 2 maintains Dr. Ozmon, an education professor at VCU. 2 ̆ 2 We 2 ̆ 7 ve gained a lot of respectability. 2 ̆ 2 Two universities, in Massachusetts and Arizona, offer degrees in futures studies. In Virginia, the World Future Society [...] an eclectic group of future-thinkers [...] includes marketing experts and career planners, college professors and architects, and the secretary of human resources. The magazine they read, 2 ̆ 2 The Futurist, 2 ̆ 2 dwells on such issues as hyperintelligence, the use of video games to build a personal sense of accomplishment, robot burglar alarms and Europe 2 ̆ 7 s changing taste for lighter beer. More science than art 2 ̆ 2 Very little of it is crystal ball gazing, 2 ̆ 2 says Maria Robotham, a senior researcher at The Futures Group, an 80 -person Hartford, Conn., think tank whose clients include soft drink makers and the CIA. (Government contracts account for half of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s 6 million business.) 2 ̆ 2 It 2 ̆ 7 s much more science than art, 2 ̆ 2 says Marvin Cetron, a former Navy planner who claims his Arlington-based firm, Forecasting International, is batting an enviable. 950 [...] which includes predictions of the Shah of Iran 2 ̆ 7 s fall, Ronald Reagan 2 ̆ 7 s rise, and of Poland 2 ̆ 7 s turmoil. Dr. Cetron 2 ̆ 7 s staff of 35 literally takes on the globe: among their clients are 76 industrial firms, 17 foreign countries, and 10 U. S. government agencies [...] all of whom make it a booming 2 million-a-year business. Dr. Cetron insists his views are founded in fact and soldered with pure science. 2 ̆ 2 We look at quantitative indicators and do trend extrapolation. We use computers... We 2 ̆ 7 ve got hundreds of global events in our data banks. 2 ̆ 2 But, warn most futurologists: don 2 ̆ 7 t count on any of it. As noted William and Mary law school Dean William Spong, who chaired Gov. Robb 2 ̆ 7 s panel on the future, 2 ̆ 2 This represents our best judgment, but we don 2 ̆ 7 t pretend to be Moses. 2 ̆ 2 Avoid assumptions In a classic episode of 2 ̆ 2 The Twilight Zone, 2 ̆ 2 a man manages to get a copy of a future newspaper. He duly scans the stock report and invests in the stocks that will gain the most. In his frenzy, the man fails to notice one small item in the same newspaper: his own obituary. Perhaps that 2 ̆ 7 s a good tale to illustrate a common warning issued by soothsayers these days: be careful, especially about assumptions. 2 ̆ 2 If you 2 ̆ 7 re a very responsible futures researcher, 2 ̆ 2 says Ms. Robotham, 2 ̆ 2 you tell your client that 2 ̆ 7 there 2 ̆ 7 s no way I can tell you the future, only of things evolving. 2 ̆ 7 We make it clear to people that we 2 ̆ 7 re not going to give them the magic bullet. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 The artistry is in knowing what assumptions to make, 2 ̆ 2 says Fisher. 2 ̆ 2 And what assumptions not to make. 2 ̆ 2 Fisher, a successful businessman and three-term congressman before joining Robb 2 ̆ 7 s cabinet, counts among his failures numerous predictions in his once-acclaimed 1950 s book, 2 ̆ 2 Resources in America 2 ̆ 7 s Future, 2 ̆ 2 one of the first compendiums of large-scale projections for the American economy. He wasn 2 ̆ 7 t far off the mark on the gross national product, industrial production figures of the aggregate work force? But these successes, he said, 2 ̆ 2 covered up a cancellation of errors in many other directions. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 In energy, we overestimated the nuclear. [But who could have foreseen all the problems that have arisen?] We missed on gas. [But we weren 2 ̆ 7 t so bad on coal. ] We missed on women, too. Ironically, we 2 ̆ 7 d been criticized for overestimating the number of women entering the labor force; in fact, we way undervalued it. In some cases, we were really wildly off the mark. 2 ̆ 2 Some futurologists have gone so far as to deny they 2 ̆ 7 re making forecasts. 2 ̆ 2 A lot of people still believe we 2 ̆ 7 re in the business of making predictions. That 2 ̆ 7 s not the case. We 2 ̆ 7 re just trying to describe the possibilities, 2 ̆ 2 says Edward Cornish, president of the 30, 000 -member World Future Society, a multidisciplinary group of future-minded academicians and business-men. This group, too, is nothing to scoff at when it comes to names. Directors include, besides Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s Fisher former U. S. Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman, former U. S. atomic Energy Commission Chairman Glenn T. Seaborg, and former Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara. 2 ̆ 2 If we know more about the possibilities, we ourselves will choose the future, 2 ̆ 2 says Cornish, summing up their credo. 2 ̆ 2 That 2 ̆ 7 s the only way that our future won 2 ̆ 7 t just be imposed by some fate. 2 ̆ 2 It would be irresponsible, for example, for a corporation to make a 20 -year investment, says Fisher, without first getting the best projection it can. 2 ̆ 2 When it comes to the future, 2 ̆ 2 he says, 2 ̆ 2 even a poor view is better than none. 2 ̆...|$|E
