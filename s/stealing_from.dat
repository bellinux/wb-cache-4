5|$|The fivecondemned without {{commutation}} {{were all}} from Littleport.

5|$|Despite his {{previous}} actions of breaking into ISIS and hacking the mainframe, Archer is excused from his expenses after Cyril {{comes to the}} assumption that Kremenski had been <b>stealing</b> <b>from</b> Archer's account the whole time. Malory notes {{that she would have}} known if there was a mole at ISIS, her earlier phone call shown to have been with Nikolai Jakov, head of the KGB. She changes the subject when questioned, and rather complains that someone left donuts on the floor attracting ants.|$|E
50|$|In fictional works, {{the phantom}} thief is {{typically}} superb at stealing {{while maintaining a}} gentlemans manners and code of honour; for example, Robin Hood is a former earl or yeoman who <b>steals</b> <b>from</b> the rich {{to give to the}} poor, Raffles only <b>steals</b> <b>from</b> other gentlemen (and occasionally gives the object away to a good cause); Lupin <b>steals</b> <b>from</b> the rich who do not appreciate their art or treasures and redistributes it; Saint Tail steals back what was stolen or taken dishonestly, or rights the wrongs done to the innocent by implicating the real criminals. Sly Cooper and his gang <b>steal</b> <b>from</b> other thieves and criminals.|$|R

5|$|Some species, {{including}} frigatebirds, gulls, and skuas, {{engage in}} kleptoparasitism, stealing food items from other birds. Kleptoparasitism {{is thought to}} be a supplement to food obtained by hunting, rather than a significant part of any species' diet; a study of great frigatebirds <b>stealing</b> <b>from</b> masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most 40% of their food and on average stole only 5%. Other birds are scavengers; some of these, like vultures, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like gulls, corvids, or other birds of prey, are opportunists.|$|E
5|$|Then nine {{defendants}} {{were charged with}} threatening W. Cooper of Ely and <b>stealing</b> <b>from</b> him. Mr Gurney addressed the jury, explaining {{the circumstances of the}} disturbances carried out by the mob in Ely. Nine witnesses were called. Mr Justice Abbott spoke to the jury for a long time. The jury retired for fifteen minutes. On returning, it pronounced as guilty Dennis, Jessop, Atkin, Layton, Hobbs, Pricke, Cooper, and Jefferson. It acquitted Freeman.|$|E
5|$|Bart goes to {{the video}} game store and coerces the clerk to let him buy the new and violent Grand Theft Scratchy game, only to have it confiscated by Marge. While Bart mopes, a video game manual crashes {{down from the sky}} in front of him. Reading through the manual, Bart discovers that he {{and the rest of his}} family have special powers. Later, Bart uses his Bartman powers to stop Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph from <b>stealing</b> <b>from</b> the Natural History Museum, Homer uses his ability to become a huge ball and win an eating contest, Lisa uses her powers of {{meditation}} to stop a deforestation project, and Marge uses her powers to influence crowds to stop the release of Grand Theft Scratchy in Springfield, although Lisa points out it is ironic she used violence to stop a violent game.|$|E
60|$|You will {{substantiate}} them. What a {{chain of}} theft it is. My father <b>steals</b> <b>from</b> the people. The documents that prove his stealing are stolen by Gherst.

50|$|Five {{soldiers}} were shot execution style in Mogadishu {{in a district}} known for rogue soldiers to <b>steal</b> <b>from</b> civilians and local shops, and set up illegal toll blocks. It is unknown if these five {{soldiers were}} sent to dismantle such tolls or were trying to <b>steal</b> <b>from</b> civilians when they were killed.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} concept of ships, Seafarers also {{introduces}} the notion of the pirate, which acts as a waterborne robber which <b>steals</b> <b>from</b> nearby ships (similar to how the robber <b>steals</b> <b>from</b> nearby settlements). The pirate can also prevent ships from being built or moved nearby, but it does not interfere with harbors.|$|R
5|$|Brought {{to the bar}} {{next was}} Henry Benson, a farmer who was out on bail, charged with inciting to riot. Benson was held in surety for £400 plus two other sureties for £200 each. He was to appear for trial at the next assizes. Richard Cooper the elder and Richard Cooper the younger were also bound over to the next assizes. Father and son, William Beamiss the elder and the younger, were then brought in and charged with assaulting and <b>stealing</b> <b>from</b> Robert Cheesewright the younger, of Littleport, in the Isle of Ely. Mr Gurney {{addressed}} the jury. Mr Burrough summed up and the jury gave their guilty verdict to both prisoners shortly after.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds will rob other seabirds such as boobies, {{particularly}} the red-footed booby, tropicbirds, shearwaters, petrels, terns, gulls and even ospreys of their catch, using their speed and manoeuvrability to outrun and harass their victims until they regurgitate their stomach contents. They may either assail their targets {{after they have}} caught their food or circle high over seabird colonies waiting for parent birds to return laden with food. Although frigatebirds are renowned for their kleptoparasitic feeding behaviour, kleptoparasitism is not thought to play {{a significant part of}} the diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great frigatebirds <b>stealing</b> <b>from</b> masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed the Radiant A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were designed to make choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. The manner in which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to <b>stealing</b> <b>from</b> others, if they are given the opportunity {{and if it is}} in their character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E

5|$|Lennon's former {{personal}} assistant Fred Seaman (who was earlier convicted for and admitted <b>stealing</b> <b>from</b> Lennon's personal belongings) has claimed that by this time, however, Lennon had also quietly renounced the counterculture views {{which he had}} helped promote during the 1960s and 1970s and became more aligned with conservatism and was supportive of Ronald Reagan, though whether he had actually aligned to a more conservative world view is disputed. Some commentators noted that Seaman's claims have low credibility, considering {{that he was a}} thief who had abused his position to steal from Lennon, and had also earlier released a book with dubious allegations about Lennon which had largely been ignored.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Berry bought the Southern Air, a {{restaurant}} in Wentzville, Missouri. In 1990 he was sued by several women who claimed that he had installed a video camera in the bathroom. Berry claimed {{that he had the}} camera installed to catch a worker who was suspected of <b>stealing</b> <b>from</b> the restaurant. Though his guilt was never proved in court, Berry opted for a class action settlement. (One of the biographers, Bruce Pegg, estimated that, with 59 women, it cost Berry over $1.2 million plus legal fees.). His lawyers said he had been the victim of a conspiracy to profit from his wealth. During this time Berry began using Wayne T. Schoeneberg as his legal counsel. Reportedly, a police raid on his house found intimate videotapes of women, one of whom being apparently a minor. Also found in the raid were 62grams of marijuana. Felony drug and child-abuse charges were filed. As the child-abuse charges were dropped, Berry agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor possession of marijuana. He was given a six-month suspended jail sentence and two years' unsupervised probation and was ordered to donate $5,000 to a local hospital.|$|E

Divorce was granted with a decree nisi in March 1951 after Rosaleen {{was found to}} have committed adultery with Notts County director Adrian Van Geffen; Lawton never saw Amanda again and was not required to pay child support. He would not hear from his daughter until she was convicted of <b>stealing</b> <b>from</b> playwright George Axelrod in 1968, by which time Rosaleen was on her fourth marriage and living in Jamaica. Lawton married second wife Gladys Rose in September 1952, who bore him a son, Thomas Junior. Gladys was also divorced, and her ex-husband cited Lawton as a co-respondent in the divorce proceedings as the pair had begun their relationship whilst Gladys was still married; her family were staunch Catholics, and Gladys was ostracised by her family following her divorce. Gladys had a daughter, Carol, from her previous marriage, who Lawton raised as his own. Thomas Junior went on to play rugby union for Leicester Tigers.|$|E
