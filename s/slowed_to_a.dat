5|$|Although the 1920s saw {{a slight}} growth in traffic, the network's {{expansion}} <b>slowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> halt. Private motoring had arrived {{to put an}} end to its monopoly. The rising power of buses and trolleybuses, the Great Depression in France, and above all the Second World War that ravaged Rouen and Normandy, condemned the tramway to death. The last trams stopped running in 1953, after seventy-six years of service. However, in 1994, a new Rouen tramway came to the Norman capital.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{development}} {{of nuclear power}} in the United States <b>slowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> halt, as new plants were cancelled or put on hold. The 1983 financial collapse of the Washington Public Power Supply System, a government agency planning to build five large nuclear power plants throughout the state, and the Three Mile Island accident of 1979 both contributed {{to a decline in}} interest in the university's nuclear program. Student use of the reactor was replaced by commercial use to produce nuclear isotopes for medical use. By 1988, the enrollment in UW's nuclear engineering program shrunk to 23 students, and it was cancelled entirely in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 7th Marines {{opened the}} road between Hagaru-ri and Koto-ri by {{capturing}} {{the high ground}} surrounding the road. But {{as soon as the}} Marines pulled out, the 77th Division returned to the peaks and attacked the column. Chaotic fighting broke out within the column and the retreat was <b>slowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> crawl. The Marine night fighters, however, returned to subdue the Chinese forces, and the fighting destroyed most of the blocking troops. On 7 December, the rest of the column managed to reach Koto-ri with little difficulty with the last elements arrived at Koto-ri that night.|$|E

5|$|On June 11, 2011, {{the three}} year-old {{finished}} {{fifth in the}} Belmont Stakes after holding the lead {{for much of the}} race on a sloppy track. As the pacesetter, Shackleford led throughout most of the 1-1/2 mile race, which started with a moderate quarter-mile in :23.9, then <b>slowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> leisurely :49.0 for the opening half, 1:14.5 for three-quarters, and 1:39.9 for a mile. After leading the first nine furlongs, he faded in the stretch. Winner Ruler On Ice as well as Stay Thirsty, Brilliant Speed and Nehro passed him.|$|E
5|$|By 1300 only Harlech and Conwy {{had been}} {{properly}} completed: Caernarfon's town walls were finished, {{but much of}} the castle was still incomplete and at Beaumaris Castle the inner walls was only half their intended height, with gaps in the outer walls. By 1304 the total building programme in Wales had come to at least £80,000, almost six times Edward's annual income. Edward had meanwhile become embroiled in a long-running sequence of wars in Scotland which began to consume his attention and financial resources, and as a result further work on the Welsh castles <b>slowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> crawl. In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, spurring fresh construction work, but money remained much more limited than before. By 1330 all new work had finally ceased, and Caernarfon and Beaumaris were never fully completed.|$|E
5|$|Kreml, {{named after}} the Kremlin, was ordered on 20 April 1863 when a {{contract}} was signed with the Russian shipbuilder Semiannikov & Poletika for a total cost of 898,000 rubles. Construction had not yet begun when the Russian Admiralty Board amended the contract on 20 July to shorten the construction time by one year for a payment of an extra 48,000 rubles {{in response to the}} adverse foreign reaction to the brutal Russian suppression of the revolts in Poland and Lithuania that year. Fearing attack by Britain and France, the Board switched priority to the smaller s shortly afterwards in the belief that they could be completed more quickly so that progress on Kreml <b>slowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> crawl once construction began on 2 October. The ship was not formally laid down until 23 December and she was launched on 26 August 1865.|$|E

5|$|On September 1, the {{hurricane}} began to rapidly deepen over warm {{waters of the}} Caribbean Sea; by 1800 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), it had strengthened to Category 4 intensity. Continuing westward, the storm passed north of Swan Island later that day. Early on September 2, a double eyewall appeared on satellite imagery. Carmen's forward movement gradually slowed as the storm took a west by north direction, and it reached its initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h), accompanied by a central barometric pressure of 928 mbar (hPa; 27.4 inHg). Atmospheric steering currents became increasingly weaker, and Carmen <b>slowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> drift. Later on September 2, {{the hurricane}} made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula; its northern jog spared Belize City from a direct hit. The storm's center passed {{a few miles north}} of Chetumal, Quintana Roo.|$|E
5|$|Organised {{water supply}} in the town began at least by 1883 when it was {{reported}} being carted from the millrace. The river's water was used as wells in the town were deemed too brackish. Five years later Thomas Monds installed hydraulic rams and began pumping water from the river to three iron tanks in the town. He on-sold the water to townspeople, though the mill had priority over river water; this was a particular problem during droughts when the Liffey <b>slowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> trickle. Westbury Council—local government of the time—called for tenders for Carrick's water supply in 1889. This water supply system was completed in 1890. Water was again pumped from the river near the mill, again by hydraulic rams, to a tank near {{the centre of the}} town which supplied another tank on the main road and some houses on the same road. Both tanks had troughs and hoses for public use.|$|E
5|$|Racer's {{hurricane}} was {{a destructive}} tropical cyclone that had severe effects on northeastern Mexico and the Gulf Coast of the United States in early October1837. It takes {{its name from}} the Royal Navy ship Racer, which sustained some damage when it encountered the hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. The storm first affected Jamaica with flooding rainfall and strong winds on September26 and27, before entering the Gulf of Mexico by October1. As the hurricane approached northern Tamaulipas and southern Texas, it <b>slowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> crawl and turned sharply eastward. The storm battered the GulfCoast from Texas to the Florida Panhandle between October3 and7, and after crossing the Southeastern United States, it emerged into the Atlantic shipping lanes off the Carolinas. For most of the storm's duration, the strongest winds and heaviest rains were confined to the northern side of its track.|$|E

5|$|The cyclone's 1-minute winds {{increased}} {{once again}} to 140km/h, marking its second and final peak at 0000 UTC on November 18. The JMA, however, maintained Nepartak as a severe tropical storm. The JTWC indicated that 25W made a second landfall {{on the coast of}} Hainan, although the JMA did not make such mention, implying Nepartak's center remained over the Gulf of Tonkin. Regardless, the cyclone's circulation had obscured most of Hainan and the Gulf of Tonkin and reached into adjacent Vietnam, and its forward speed <b>slowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> crawl. Extended interaction with land proved detrimental to the storm, and it began to rapidly disintegrate. Just 18 hours after its final bout of strengthening, Nepartak had been reduced to an exposed circulation center with no associated thunderstorms. Turning toward the northeast, the system had been concurrently downgraded to a tropical depression by the JTWC and JMA early on November 19. The weak remnant low of Nepartak limped ashore over Beihai, China at 1900 UTC and dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|E

25|$|However, on {{the morning}} of 1 May, Indian patrols found that the Japanese had withdrawn. The 17th Division rapidly bridged the Pegu River and resumed its advance, but the monsoon had already broken.

25|$|The {{alternative}} is the wheel landing. This requires the pilot {{to land the}} aircraft on the main wheels while maintaining the tailwheel {{in the air with}} elevator to keep the angle of attack low. Once the aircraft has <b>slowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> speed that can ensure control will not be lost, but above the speed at which rudder effectiveness is lost, then the tailwheel is lowered to the ground.|$|E
5000|$|The Citroën 2CV {{gained an}} {{optional}} centrifugal clutch, marketed in English-speaking countries as [...] "Trafficlutch".

Cummings, urged by his boosters, started to run again, which caused George to start to run again. He beat Cummings by some 65 yards {{in a time of}} 4:20, remarkably fast given his leisurely last lap.|$|E
25|$|Sales <b>slowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> trickle in {{the wake}} of the {{introduction}} of the Renault Alliance. These were more modern, space-efficient, fuel-efficient 4-cylinder, front-wheel-drive cars compared to the rear-drive Concord with its aging platform. The imported Renault 18-based 18i sedan Sportwagon sold by AMC/Jeep/Renault dealers were also more efficient replacements. All Concord and Spirit models were quietly dropped by the end of the 1983 model year. The future for AMC's Concord and Spirit series was sealed for the 1980s as rear-drive cars were replaced by front-drive models.|$|E
25|$|From 2004 onward, various {{efforts were}} {{launched}} to port the Hurd to more modern microkernels.

Nevertheless, during 2005, Hurd developer Neal Walfield finished the initial memory management framework for the L4/Hurd port, and Marcus Brinkmann ported essential parts of glibc; namely, getting the process startup code working, allowing programs to run, thus allowing the first user programs (trivial ones such as the hello world program) in C to run.|$|E
