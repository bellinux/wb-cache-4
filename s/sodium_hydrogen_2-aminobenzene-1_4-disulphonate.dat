40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate/citric acid {{mixtures}} on enhancing phytoremediation of heavy metal-contaminated soil by alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) {{and the changes}} of metal availability in soils were investigated. Alfalfa plants grew healthily in heavy metals-contaminated soils (collected from molybdenum mine) for 30 days. The heavy metal content was determined by ICP-OES. In this paper, it was found that: the phytoextraction efficiency of alfalfa plants was enhanced after the <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate/citric acid mixtures were added into soil. As usual, the phosphorus can promote plants to accumulate more biomass (increasing 0. 35 %- 24. 62 %) even if the availability of metals to extraction were increased by citric acid in the soil. With the treatment of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate/citric acid mixtures, the bioconcentration factor (BCF) values of alfalfa plants and the acid soluble fractions of heavy metals in soils were increased. The translocation factor (TF) values of all alfalfas in heavy metals were low, but the TF of As, Cr, Hg, Mo tended to increase with <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate/citric acid mixtures. In other words, both the availability and the biological-validity of heavy metals in soils were increased after <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate/citric acid mixtures were added into soils...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bacterial {{production}} of anionic sulphide is {{increased in the}} colon of ulcerative colitis and sulphides can cause metabolic damage to colonocytes. AIMS: To assess the reversal of the damaging effect of sulphide to isolated colonocytes by methionine and methionine derivatives. METHODS AND SUBJECTS: Isolated colonocytes were prepared from rat colons and 12 human colectomy specimens. In cell suspensions 14 CO 2 /acetoacetate generation was measured from [1 - 14 C]-butyrate (5. 0 mmol/l) {{in the presence of}} 0 - 2. 0 mmol/l <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> sulphide. The effect of 5. 0 mmol/l L-methionine, S-adenosylmethionine 1, 4 butane disulphonate and DL-methionine-S-methylsulphonium chloride on sulphide inhibited oxidation was observed. RESULTS: In rat colonocytes <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> sulphide dose dependently reduced oxidative metabolite formation from n-butyrate, an action reversed in order of efficacy by S-adenosylmethionine 1, 4 butane disulphonate > DLmethionine-S-methyl-sulphonium chloride > L-methionine. In human colonocytes S-adenosylmethionine 1, 4 butane disulphonate most significantly improved 14 CO 2 production (p = < 0. 005) suppressed by <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> sulphide. CONCLUSION: Sulphide toxicity in colonocytes is reversible by methyl donors.

40|$|A {{combination}} of using an aqueous solution of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> carbonate for forward-extraction of carboxylic acids from a dilute apolar organic solvent, {{and carbon dioxide}} under pressure for its back-recovery, is studied. Used in combination, these two steps might provide a technique for the recovery of a carboxylic acid from an organic solution in which no formation of by-products (inorganic salts) occurs and only environmentally benign chemicals are used. Results show that the aqueous solution of <b>sodium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> carbonate provides distribution ratios for several aromatic and aliphatic acids as high as 200, whereas the solubility of the organic solvent in the aqueous solution remains unchanged relative to pure water. Two options for the back-recovery of the extracted acids based {{on the use of}} CO 2 under pressure are evaluated: by new phase (liquid or solid) formation or by back-extraction.
