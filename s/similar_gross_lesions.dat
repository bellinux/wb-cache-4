Four- and 20 -week-old chickens of lines 15 × 7 and CM (commercial source) had substantial resistance to mortality and <b>gross</b> <b>lesions.</b> In contrast, in line 7, which was tested at 1 -day, 2 -, 4 -, 8 -, 12 - and 16 -week age levels, 4 -week-old chickens were fully susceptible to clinical Marek's disease (MD), although resistance was demonstrated at 8 -week and older age levels. Genetically resistant chickens of line 6 maintained their resistance at all age levels tested. Pathogenesis of MD was compared in 12 -week-old and 1 -day-old chickens of line 15 × 7. Within the 1 -day-old group, 23 % of the chickens died because of MD, whereas there were no deaths in the 12 -week-old group.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of disease}} caused by Serpulina hyodysenteriae was examined by (1) determining the susceptibilities of inbred murine strains to lesion development, (2) examining {{the ability of}} S. hyodysenteriae endotoxin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparations to induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and (3) investigating the contributions of secondary bacteria to S. hyodysenteriae-induced pathogenesis in gnotobiotic mice. Of all inbred murine strains tested, C 3 H strains of mice appeared most susceptible to lesion development after S. hyodysenteriae challenge. C 3 H/HeJ mice, being LPS-hyporesponsive, were less susceptible to lesion development than LPS-responsive C 3 H/HeN. S. hyodysenteriae endotoxin preparations were active in increasing serum TNF activity in vivo in mice. Sera from pigs treated with S. hyodysenteriae endotoxin or LPS preparations exhibited much less TNF activity than sera from pigs treated with LPS from Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium;Secondary bacteria appear to contribute a dynamic role to the pathogenesis of the disease; treating conventional mice with oral antibiotics prevented lesion formation even {{with high levels of}} colonizing S. hyodysenteriae. Additionally, a defined diet is described which, through presumed changes in gut microflora, increases susceptibility of mice to development of lesions after S. hyodysenteriae challenge. Gnotobiotic mice were monoassociated with S. hyodysenteriae or with S. innocens for protracted incubation times. A difference noted histologically between the two groups was that pathogenesis S. hyodysenteriae invaded the lamina propria of the cecum, whereas the non-pathogenic S. innocens did not. Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were experimentally challenged with S. hyodysenteriae; SCID mice developed <b>similar</b> <b>gross</b> cecal <b>lesions,</b> but, histologically, the lamina propria cellular infiltrate was characterized by high numbers of neutrophils. Since SCID mice are lacking in functional T or B lymphocytes, this might suggest that inflammatory cytokines are being produced in the cecal lamina propria of infected mice, primarily by macrophages...|$|R

40|$|We {{surveyed}} the reefs of Grande Terre, New Caledonia, for coral diseases in 2010 and 2013. Lesions encountered in hard and soft corals were systematically described at the gross and microscopic level. We sampled paired and normal tissues from 101 and 65 colonies in 2010 and 2013, respectively, comprising 51 species of corals from 27 genera. Tissue loss {{was the most}} common <b>gross</b> <b>lesion</b> sampled (40 %) followed by discoloration (28 %), growth anomalies (13 %), bleaching (10 %), and flatworm infestation (1 %). When grouped by <b>gross</b> <b>lesions,</b> the diversity of microscopic lesions as measured by Shannon-Wiener index was highest for tissue loss, followed by discoloration, bleaching, and growth anomaly. Our findings document an extension of the range of certain diseases such as Porites trematodiasis and endolithic hypermycosis (dark spots) to the Western Pacific as well as the presence of a putative cnidarian endosymbiont. We also expand the range of species infected by cell-associated microbial aggregates, and confirm the trend that these aggregates predominate in dominant genera of corals in the Indo-Pacific.

Although most inoculated birds {{of all three}} breeds developed swelling of one or both legs below the hock joint at 3 to 4 weeks of age, <b>gross</b> <b>lesions</b> of tenosynovitis became progressively more severe and extended above the joints only in broilers, whereas in most orally-infected SPF and commercial light chickens <b>gross</b> <b>lesions</b> were intermittently severe and regressed with time.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of high stocking density as a predisposing factor in an experimental model of necrotic enteritis in broiler chicks. The experimental challenge model included an oral inoculation with 10 -fold dose of attenuated anticoccidial vaccine and multiple oral inoculations with a specific strain of Clostridium perfringens. Two hundred and forty as hatched day-old broiler chicks were randomly allocated to four treatment groups according to the following experimental design: group N, with normal stocking density (15 birds/m(2)) and no challenge; group D, with high stocking density (30 birds/m(2)) and no challenge; group P, with normal stocking density and positive challenge; and group DP, with high stocking density and positive challenge. From each bird, the intestine, gizzard and liver were collected and scored for <b>gross</b> <b>lesions.</b> The intestinal digesta was collected for pH and viscosity determination. One caecum from each bird was taken for microbiological analysis. The statistical analysis and evaluation of the experimental data revealed significant interaction effects between "stocking density" and "challenge", regarding <b>gross</b> <b>lesion</b> scores in intestine and liver, pH values in jejunum, ileum and caeca as well as C. perfringens counts in the caeca (P <= 0. 05). High stocking density in challenged birds increased the <b>gross</b> <b>lesion</b> score in the intestine (P <= 0. 05), contrary to unchallenged birds.
