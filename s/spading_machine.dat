40|$|A {{comparison}} between a traditional ploughing and a spading (performed at different travelling and rotor speeds) {{was carried out}} in a paddy field, for evaluating both technical and agronomic parameters (working time, power required, fuel consumption, pulling force, efficiency of crop residues incorporation, etc.). The ploughing showed an effective tillage capacity 51 % higher than the faster spading, and a reduction ranging between 20. 8 and 44. 1 % of fuel consumption per surface unit. On the contrary, the <b>spading</b> <b>machine</b> requested no or minimum pulling force, making possible its use even in critical conditions, as for example on wet soil. On the other hand, the <b>spading</b> <b>machine</b> shows clear advantages under the agronomic point of view: in fact it does not create the typical compact layer {{at the bottom of the}} working depth, which reduces the root penetration and does not allow the capillary circulation of the solution into the soil. Indeed, in the paddy field the creation of a compact layer is able to reduce the water consumption, so it is not considered a problem to be solved. In any case, the <b>spading</b> <b>machine</b> better managed the crop residues, because they were mixed along the completely tilled layer...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{fumigant}} efficacy in forest-tree and {{ornamental nurseries}} {{depends on the}} tillage tool used for incorporation. Maximum depth and uniformity of incorporation of surface applied materials by three rotary tillers and a <b>spading</b> <b>machine</b> were compared in a loamy sand nursery using ceramic-sphere tracers (1 - 3 mm diameter) and dazomet (tetrahydro- 3, 5,dimethyl- 2 H- 1, 3, 5 -thia-diazone- 2 -thione) micro-granules. Depth of incorporation in the top 30 cm of soil was evaluated by (1) recovery of incorporated spheres in 2 cm increments, (2) biocidal activity in 6 cm increments, and (3) cone resistance by 1. 5 cm increments to 45 cm. Uniformity of incorporation was evaluated by sphere recovery and biocidal activity. Depths above which more than 95 % of the spheres were recovered for the four implements were: 12. 5 cm, Kuhn and Fobro rotary tillers; 17 cm, Northwest rotary tiller; 21 cm, Gramegna <b>spading</b> <b>machine.</b> The <b>spading</b> <b>machine</b> produced a distribution of spheres through the soil profile closest to a uniform distribution compared with that produced by the three rotary tillers. Lettuce seed (Lactuca satiua L.) germination was inhibited in the upper 12 cm in low and high dazomet rate treatments, indicating that all four implements effectively incorporated dazomet into that zone. Maximum depth (24 cm) for tota...|$|E
40|$|Two {{series of}} trials were {{conducted}} in northern bareroot forest nurseries to determine: 1) the effects of different incorporation implements and two chemical application rates on the efficacy of dazomet hrnigation; and 2) soil penetration resistance in the vertical soil profile following sub-soilmng by two different implements. When target pests were located> 18 cm deep, the <b>spading</b> <b>machine</b> was more effective than three different rotary tillers in reducing fungi. Mortahty and dlsease ratings in this trial were lowest and percentages of shippable seedlings highest for the <b>spading</b> <b>machine</b> {{at the end of}} the 3 + 0 year. However, when target pests were < 18 cm deep, all of the implements performed equally well at the lower dazomet rate. Cone indlces obtained through the vertical soil profile one year after treatment for an alternative subsoiler were much lower (in other words, decreased penetration resistance) than those obtained for the cooperating nursery's subsoiler. Importance of understanding what planned tillage events in a nursery d and d not accomplish is discussed.

5000|$|The {{steaming}} time depends on soil structure {{as well as}} outside temperature and amounts to 1-1.5 hours per 10 cm steaming depth. Hereby the soil reaches a temperature of about 85 °C. Milling for soil loosening is not recommended since soil structure may become too fine which reduces its penetrability for steam. The usage of <b>spading</b> <b>machines</b> is ideal for soil loosening. The best results can be achieved if the soil is cloddy at greater depth and granulated at lesser depth.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{agricultural}} machinery represents the main aspect {{contributing to the}} total energy input in the agricultural system. The study evaluated the energy requirements and the work quality of two conventional (threefurrow plough and <b>spading</b> <b>machine)</b> and of four conservation implements (rotary harrow, subsoiler, disk harrow, combined cultivator) for mediumdeep primary tillage in a silty-clay soil, widespread in Central Italy. The tests were carried out {{with the aim of}} selecting the most energy-efficient implement. Working speed, force of traction, fuel consumption and energy demands were measured, using a 205 kW instrumented tractor. Cloddiness and roughness of the tilled soil, biomass coverage index and burying degree were evaluated. The conservation tillage implements gave the best results in fuel consumption and energy requirements respect to the conventional implements, with energy savings up to 86 % in the case of disk harrow. The rotary harrow showed intermediate values and the best soil refinement. Among the conservation implements, the disk harrow showed the best performance on biomass coverage index (43. 8 %), while the combined cultivator showed the highest value of biomass burying (87. 8 %) and the best performance on fuel consumption per hour (25. 8 kg h – 1) ...|$|E
40|$|In environments {{characterized}} by steep slopes or arranged in terraces, among the shallow tillage systems, rototilling is extensively used. However, {{the effect of}} the repeated use of ro-totilling has a considerable influence on soil characteristics; it appears finely powdered, soft and without structure. In order to limit these inconveniences, an innovative self-propelled machine equipped with working tools as a spade, to be used in steep slopes or arranged in terraces areas, was designed by the Mechanics Section of the Department of Agricultural and Forest Sciences, University of Palermo, in cooperation with Agrotec company, Padua, Italy. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the effects of three machines for shallow tillage: a chisel plough (CP), a rototilling (RT) and a <b>spading</b> <b>machine</b> (SM) on penetration resistance in semi-arid environments of the Mediterranean basin. No tillage was also included. Penetration resistance (PR) was surveyed for all the treatments to a depth of 300 mm with an electronic dynamometer. The study was carried out in 2011 - 201. The treatments consisted in the exe-cution of a shallow tillage to a depth of 150 mm. SP treatment allowed us to obtain PR lower values throughout the tillage profile than RT, CP and NT. It follows that the type of machine used influences soil PR, and then the soil water storage capacity, key factor for the agricultural productions in semi-arid environments as in Sicily...|$|E
40|$|Within the Mediterranean basin, soil tillage {{enhances the}} {{mineralisation}} of soil organic matter. We assessed the short-term impact of shallow tillage [field cultivator (FC), rotary tiller (RT) and <b>spading</b> <b>machine</b> (SM) ] on some soil quality indicators [bulk density, water-stable aggregates, total and labile organic C pools (microbial biomass and extractable organic C), soil respiration and related eco-physiological indexes] in a Sicilian vineyard. Also no tillage was included. We hypothesized that (i) RT and FC worsened soil quality indicators more than SM, and (ii) {{within the same}} tillage system, labile C pools, soil respiration and eco-physiological indexes will respond more efficiently than chemical and physical soil properties since the tillage starts. The experiment started at March 2009, and each tillage type was applied three times per year (March or April, May and June), with soil tilled up to 15 -cm depth. Soil was sampled (0 – 15 and 15 – 30 -cm depth) in March 2009, April 2010, May 2012 and June 2014. SM was very effective in preserving soil organic matter pool and in improving any monitored soil quality indicator, similarly to no tillage. By contrast, RT was the most deleterious machine as it worsened most investigated indicators. Such deleterious effects were due to drastic disruption of soil aggregates and consequent exposition of protected soil organic matter to further microbial mineralization. Labile organic C pools and microbial quotients were the most responsive soil parameters for assessing the impact of shallow tillage on soil quality, even {{in the short term}} (< 5 years) ...|$|E
