5|$|Polish science {{reached its}} {{culmination}} {{in the first}} half of the 16th century. The medieval point of view was criticized, more rational explanations were attempted. Copernicus' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, published in Nuremberg in 1543, <b>shook</b> <b>up</b> the traditional value system extended into an understanding of the physical universe, doing away with its Christianity-adopted Ptolemaic anthropocentric model and setting free the explosion of scientific inquiry. Generally the prominent scientists of the period resided in many different regions of the country, and increasingly, the majority were of urban, rather than noble origin.|$|E
5|$|Francis {{introduced}} {{players with}} top-level experience such as Manchester United skipper Steve Bruce. In {{his second season}} the club narrowly missed out on a play-off position, followed by three years of play-off semifinal defeats. They also reached the 2001 League Cup final against Liverpool at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. Birmingham equalised in the last minute of normal time, but the match went to a penalty shootout which Liverpool won. By October 2001, lack of progress had made Francis's position untenable. After a 6–0 League Cup defeat to Manchester City, he left by mutual consent, replaced two months later by Steve Bruce. Bruce <b>shook</b> <b>up</b> a stale team, taking them from mid-table into the play-offs where they beat Norwich City on penalties to win promotion to the Premier League.|$|E

5|$|Reagan {{was sworn}} in as {{president}} for the second time on January 20, 1985, in a private ceremony at the White House. At 73 years of age, he was the oldest person to ever have been sworn into a second term. Because January 20 fell on a Sunday, a public celebration was not held but took place in the Capitol rotunda the following day. January 21 was one of the coldest days on record in Washington, D.C.; due to poor weather, inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol. In the coming weeks he <b>shook</b> <b>up</b> his staff somewhat, moving White House Chief of Staff James Baker to Secretary of the Treasury and naming Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, a former Merrill Lynch officer, Chief of Staff.|$|E
5|$|Stage 12 into Briançon in France was the Giro's first high {{mountain}} stage, and it <b>shook</b> <b>up</b> the standings {{for the final}} time. Di Luca took the stage win, twice attacking from an elite group of five that had made the climb together. As Noè finished nearly ten minutes behind, Di Luca took the pink jersey for a third time, while still holding the green jersey. As Di Luca concentrated on winning the race overall, Piepoli took the green jersey after stage 15, the race's queen stage, topping two of that stage's climbs in first position. His lead in the mountains classification quickly became unassailable, and he won the jersey in Milan. It was also on this stage that 's Eddy Mazzoleni distinguished himself as a podium contender, taking {{a minute and a}} half out of Di Luca to move into second overall. Schleck lost time to Di Luca and Mazzoleni, but gained time over other riders in the top of the overall standings and stood third overall.|$|E

She starred as Briana McCallister, inspired by the true story of an African American teenager who <b>shook</b> <b>up</b> a small town where high school proms had been racially segregated for decades.

25|$|Zhou {{moved to}} the Jiangxi base area and <b>shook</b> <b>up</b> the propaganda-oriented {{approach}} to revolution by demanding that the armed forces under Communist control actually be used to expand the base, rather than just to control and defend it. In December 1931, Zhou replaced Mao Zedong as Secretary of the First Front Army with Xiang Ying, and made himself political commissar of the Red Army, in place of Mao. Liu Bocheng, Lin Biao and Peng Dehuai all criticized Mao's tactics at the October 1932 Ningdu Conference.|$|E
25|$|Chilaw Marians {{failed to}} convert 33 for 1 after four overs into an above-average total against Leicestershire Foxes, as David Masters' medium pace bowling <b>shook</b> <b>up</b> the visitors.

With the score 57 for 6 after 10.3 overs, Chilaw were forced to consolidate, {{although}} captain Hasantha Fernando hit two straight sixes off Dinesh Mongia. However, Ottis Gibson came back to rip out two wickets at the death, and Chilaw Marians closed on 112 for 9.|$|E

25|$|The defeats of the Russian Army and Navy <b>shook</b> <b>up</b> Russian confidence. Throughout 1905, the Imperial Russian {{government}} was rocked by revolution. The population was against {{escalation of the}} war. The empire was certainly capable of sending more troops but this would make little difference in the outcome due to the poor state of the economy, the embarrassing defeats of the Russian Army and Navy by the Japanese, and the relative unimportance to Russia of the disputed land made the war extremely unpopular. Tsar Nicholas II elected to negotiate peace so he could concentrate on internal matters after the disaster of Bloody Sunday on 9 January 1905.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said that the bra took off the way it did {{in large part because of}} World War I, which <b>shook</b> <b>up</b> gender roles by putting many women to work in {{factories}} and uniforms for the first time. The war also influenced social attitudes toward women and helped to liberate them from corsets. But women were already moving into the retail and clerical sectors. Thus the bra emerged from something that was once discreetly tucked into the back pages of women's magazines in the 1890s, to prominent display in department stores such as Sears, Roebuck, and Montgomery Ward by 1918. Advertising was now promoting the shaping of the bust to contemporary fashion demands, and sales reflected this.|$|E
25|$|Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein <b>shook</b> <b>up</b> {{the team}} at the MLB trading {{deadline}} July 31, trading the team's wildly popular yet often hurt and disgruntled shortstop, Nomar Garciaparra, to the Chicago Cubs, receiving Orlando Cabrera from the Montreal Expos and Doug Mientkiewicz from the Minnesota Twins in return. In a separate transaction, the Red Sox also traded AAA outfielder Henri Stanley to the Los Angeles Dodgers for center fielder Dave Roberts. With valuable players like Cabrera, Mientkiewicz, and Roberts in the line up, the club turned things around, winning twenty-two out of twenty-five games and going on to finish within three games of the Yankees in the AL East and qualifying for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card.|$|E

25|$|The Russian plans {{included}} {{not only}} incorporation of Ukraine, but also {{recovery of the}} lands lost by Russia further north. The Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate, worried by the new configuration, were now inclined to support the Commonwealth. With the Tatars the Polish units waged a destructive raid into Ukraine and fought in early 1655 the victorious Battle of Okhmativ against combined Russian and Ukrainian forces. Later that year Khmelnytsky counterattacked, took Lublin and reached the Vistula, but was forced to acknowledge John Casimir's supremacy again when his efforts were thwarted by the Tatars. Until his death in 1657 the Cossack leader, despite the Pereyaslav treaty, conducted independent policy, intent on {{taking advantage of the}} calamities that had befallen upon the Commonwealth, but also considered an improvement of the relationship with the great power that he <b>shook</b> <b>up</b> ("fatally wounded", according to historian Timothy Snyder).|$|E
25|$|BBC Two was {{launched}} in 1964, but had struggled to capture the public's imagination. When Attenborough arrived as controller, he quickly abolished the channel's quirky kangaroo mascot and <b>shook</b> <b>up</b> the schedule. With a mission to make BBC Two's output diverse and different from that offered by other networks, he began to establish a portfolio of programmes that defined the channel's identity for decades to come. Under his tenure, music, the arts, entertainment, archaeology, experimental comedy, travel, drama, sport, business, science and natural history all found {{a place in the}} weekly schedules. Often, an eclectic mix was offered within a single evening's viewing. Programmes he commissioned included Man Alive, Call My Bluff, Chronicle, Life, One Pair of Eyes, The Old Grey Whistle Test, Monty Python's Flying Circus and The Money Programme. When BBC Two became the first British channel to broadcast in colour in 1967, Attenborough took advantage by introducing televised snooker, as well as bringing rugby league to British television on a regular basis via the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy.|$|E
25|$|On February 17, the Knicks <b>shook</b> <b>up</b> the roster, trading Miličić to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Brian Cardinal {{and cash}} considerations. A day later, the Knicks and Celtics swapped guard Nate Robinson for {{shooting}} guard Eddie House. The deal also included forward Marcus Landry {{going to the}} Celtics and the Knicks acquiring bench players J. R. Giddens and Bill Walker. The Knicks also acquired All-Star forward Tracy McGrady from the Houston Rockets and point guard Sergio Rodríguez from the Sacramento Kings in a three-way trade. The deal sent Knicks shooting guard Larry Hughes to Sacramento and forward Jordan Hill and power forward Jared Jeffries to Houston. The trades, orchestrated to give the Knicks more cap space for the summer of 2010, netted the Knicks $30 million of cap space. About three weeks after these team-changing trades, the Knicks played the Dallas Mavericks at American Airlines Center and blew them out by a score of 128–94 for their largest win of the season. However, the Knicks were eliminated from playoff contention in late March 2010 and completed their season with a 29–53 record, a regression from their first season under D'Antoni.|$|E

25|$|Once {{recovered}} from injury, Zohar regained his fitness at Maccabi Herzliya before joining Maccabi Netanya. Zohar {{was an instant}} success and started to receive money off the pitch as a spokesperson for local brands. His career was dealt a setback when he was caught hurling racial slurs towards Tzafririm Holon's Ziv Caveda (an Israeli footballer of Ethiopian extraction). In his defense, he claimed that his comments were directed at Holon's Hamisi Amani-Dove (an African American). The event startled the Israel Football Association which never had racism between players {{on the field and}} had no punishment system in place for it. Aside from receiving a one match ban and ₪5,000 fine, Zohar was publicly lambasted for his words that <b>shook</b> <b>up</b> the football world in Israel that {{was in the middle of}} promoting racial equality in Israel. After being released from his contract in Netanya, club manager, Uri Malmilian, left the club in protest. Zohar rejoined Beitar, where he was a central part of the club and helped steer the club away from the relegation zone of the table. He continued there for another season after which he announced he was retiring from football.|$|E
25|$|Although {{numerous}} naval battles {{took place}} before the 12th century, such as the large-scale Three Kingdoms Battle of Chibi in the year 208, {{it was during the}} Song Dynasty (960–1279 AD) that the Chinese established a permanent, standing navy in 1132 AD. At its height by the late 12th century there were 20 squadrons of some 52,000 marines, with the admiral's headquarters at Dinghai, while the main base remained closer to modern Shanghai in those days. The establishment of the permanent navy during the Song period came out of the need to defend against the Jurchens, who had overrun the northern half of China, and to escort merchant fleets entering the South East Pacific and Indian Ocean on long trade missions abroad to the Hindu, Islamic, and East African spheres of the world. However, considering China was a country which was longtime menaced by land-based nomadic tribes such as the Xiongnu, Göktürks, Mongols and so on, the navy was always seen as an adjunct rather than an important military force. By the 1516th centuries China's canal system and internal economy were sufficiently developed to nullify the need for the Pacific fleet, which was scuttled when conservative Confucianists gained power in the court and began a policy of introspection. After the First and Second Opium Wars, which <b>shook</b> <b>up</b> the generals of the Qing dynasty, the government attached greater importance to the navy.|$|E
500|$|Millett's 1971 film Three Lives is a 16mm {{documentary}} {{made by an}} all-woman crew, including co-director Susan Kleckner, cameraperson Lenore Bode, {{and editor}} Robin Mide, under the name Women's Liberation Cinema. The 70-minute film focuses on three women—Mallory Millett-Jones, the director's sister; Lillian Shreve, a chemist; and Robin Mide, an artist—reminiscing about their lives. Vincent Canby, The New York Times art critic, wrote: [...] "Three Lives is a good, simple movie in that it can't be bothered {{to call attention to}} itself, only to its three subjects, and to how they grew in the same male-dominated society that Miss Millett, in her Sexual Politics, so systematically tore apart, <b>shook</b> <b>up,</b> ridiculed and undermined—while, apparently, tickling it pink." [...] It received [...] "generally excellent reviews" [...] following its premiere at a New York City theater.|$|E
