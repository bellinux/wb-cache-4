As a result, Beatty and Disney reached a contracted agreement whereby any budget overruns on Dick Tracy would be deducted from Beatty's fee as producer, director, and star. Beatty and regular collaborator Bo Goldman significantly rewrote the dialogue but lost a Writers Guild arbitration {{and did not}} receive screen credit.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{deuterium}} being {{a valuable}} commodity, Archer is {{startled by the}} lack of basic medical supplies and the run-down nature of the colony. The reason becomes apparent when seven Klingons show up to collect deuterium according to their 'regular arrangement'. When Tessic informs Korok (Robertson Dean), the leader of the Klingons, {{that they do not have}} all the deuterium because two pumps were not working, Korok hits him and gives them four days to meet the order. Later, when Tucker and Archer attempt to talk them into fighting against the Klingons, Tessic tell them to take their 200 liters and leave. However, leaving does not <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Archer and he convinces the leader to resist with their support.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} to a hit-making band with original material, encouraged by Lambert, did not <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Daltrey, and a recording session of R covers went unreleased. The Who were not close friends either, apart from Moon and Entwistle, who enjoyed visiting nightclubs together in the West End of London. The group experienced a difficult time when touring Denmark in September, which culminated in Daltrey throwing Moon's amphetamines down the toilet and assaulting him. Immediately on returning to Britain, Daltrey was sacked, but was reinstated {{on the condition that}} the group became a democracy without his dominant leadership. At this time, the group enlisted Richard Cole as a roadie.|$|E

5|$|Brimsek {{started the}} 1938–39 {{season with the}} Reds, {{but he would not}} stay long with them. During an NHL {{exhibition}} game, Thompson got injured and it was unlikely that Thompson would recuperate in time for the beginning of the regular season. Needing a replacement, Brimsek was called up by the Bruins. In his NHL debut, Brimsek helped his team defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs by a score of 3–2. He started in net for one more game, a 4–1 victory against the Red Wings, before being sent back down to the Reds as Thompson recovered. Art Ross, the Bruins' coach and general manager, had seen enough of Brimsek during his two stints in Boston to contemplate promoting Brimsek full-time with the Bruins. Thompson was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for goaltender Normie Smith and $15,000.00 U.S. cash on November 16, 1938, after playing only five games with the Bruins. Ross then proceeded to promote Brimsek as the team's new starting goalie. This did not <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Bruins fans as Thompson was a favorite and he was the reigning Vezina Trophy winner.|$|E
5|$|Grunge music hit the {{mainstream}} {{in the early}} 1990s with Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana being signed to major record labels. Grunge fashion began to break into mainstream fashion in mid-1992 for both sexes and peaked in late 1993 and early 1994. As it picked up momentum, the grunge tag was being used by shops selling expensive flannelette shirts {{to cash in on}} the trend. Ironically, the non-conformist look suddenly became a mainstream trend. In the fashion world, Marc Jacobs presented a show for Perry Ellis in 1992, featuring grunge-inspired clothing mixed with high-end fabrics. Jacobs found inspiration in the ‘realism’ of grunge streetwear; he mixed it with the luxury of fashion by sending models down the catwalk in beanies, floral dresses and silk flannel shirts. Unfortunately, this did not <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> the brand owners and Jacobs was dismissed. Other designers like Anna Sui, also drew inspiration from grunge during the spring/summer 1993 season.|$|E
5|$|In September 1966 general {{elections}} were held, and Sangkum legislators with conservative and right-wing sympathies dominated the national assembly. In turn, they nominated Lon Nol, a military general who shared their political sympathies, as prime minister. However, their choice did not <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Sihanouk. To counterbalance conservative and right-wing influence, in October 1966 Sihanouk {{set up a}} shadow government made up of Sangkum legislators with left-wing sympathies. At {{the end of the}} month, Lon Nol offered to resign from his position, but was ironically stopped from doing so by Sihanouk. In April 1967 the Samlaut Uprising occurred, with local peasants fighting against government troops in Samlaut, Battambang. As soon as government troops managed to quell the fighting, Sihanouk began to suspect that three left-wing Sangkum legislatorsKhieu Samphan, Hou Yuon and Hu Nimhad incited the rebellion. When Sihanouk threatened to charge Khieu Samphan and Hou Yuon before a military tribunal, they fled into the jungle to join the Khmer Rouge, leaving Hu Nim behind.|$|E

When he arrives in the country, he realizes that the current monarch is his old friend from Brooklyn, Zup. Their celebratory reunion is short-lived when Wendell realizes {{that he needs to}} kill Zup in order to assume the throne. Wendell discovers that the assassinations are the brainchild of General Bogardus (Stanley Fields), who agrees to allow Zup to be killed in the modern fashion, with bombs dropped from airplanes.|$|R
5|$|Two {{days before}} the program's approval, Nathaniel Davis, the Assistant Secretary of State, told Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State, that he {{believed}} maintaining the secrecy of IA Feature would be impossible. Davis correctly predicted the Soviet Union would respond by increasing involvement in the Angolan conflict, leading to more violence and negative publicity for the United States. When Ford approved the program, Davis resigned. John Stockwell, the CIA's station chief in Angola, echoed Davis' criticism saying that success required {{the expansion of the}} program, but its size already exceeded what could be hidden from the public eye. Davis' deputy, former U.S. ambassador to Chile Edward Mulcahy, also opposed direct involvement. Mulcahy presented three options for U.S. policy towards Angola on 13 May 1975. Mulcahy believed the Ford administration could use diplomacy to campaign against foreign aid to the communist MPLA, refuse to take sides in factional fighting, or increase support for the FNLA and UNITA. He warned however that supporting UNITA would not <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Mobutu Sese Seko, the president of Zaire.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I, Mashbir held a {{position}} teaching military science and tactics at Syracuse University, where he first considered studying the Japanese language and culture. In August 1919, {{he asked the}} War Department if he could embark on this course of study, stating {{that it was his}} intention to apply for a posting to Japan for the purpose of learning the language if the War Department saw fit. Ranked captain, Mashbir was assigned as one of four US Army Language Officers in Japan on 7 July 1920. He relocated to Tokyo the following month to begin his four-year tour. When he arrived he reported for duty to Lieutenant Colonel Charles Burnett, the military attaché. Having few Army colleagues, while in Tokyo Mashbir sought the company of other intelligence professionals in the navy, one of whom was an assistant naval attaché, Lieutenant-Commander Ellis M. Zacharias, with whom Mashbir began a lifelong friendship and collaboration. In July 1922, at Zacharias' request, Mashbir secretly worked day and night to produce a secret plan to gather intelligence and get information out of Japan in case of war; it become known as M-Plan, named after Mashbir. His undisclosed activities working for the naval attaché did not <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> his superiors, however.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{challenges}} {{the view that}} public justification <b>sits</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> emancipatory and egalitarian intuitions. I distinguish between the depth, scope and {{the purchase of the}} discursive standing that such justification allocates, and situate within this matrix Rawls’s view of public justification. A standard objection to this view is that public justification should be more inclusive in scope. This is both plausible and problematic in emancipatory and egalitarian terms. If inclusive public justification allocates discursive standing that is rich in purchase, as seems desirable in emancipatory terms, it may be unable to allocate equal standing to all relevant people. And if it is to allocate equal standing, then the equality of that standing should be construed in terms that allow for unequal discursive purchase...|$|R
40|$|Can music {{express the}} world-view (Weltanschauung) {{of a certain}} composer, or of a certain {{historical}} era – and how? In 19 th Century, the wide-ranging philosophical implications of this question raised an intriguing quarrel between the formalists’ scepticism as to this point and their various opponents. Starting from the case study of the German psychologist and philosopher of music Georg Anschütz (1886 - 1953), {{it is argued that}} allowing for a systematic link of music and the world-views easily turns into the far more demanding (and occasionally ambiguous) claim that music is the best and perhaps the only way to express them properly. In turn, this attitude <b>sits</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> the tendency to think of music hearing as a disembodied process, hinting at the deep dimension of synesthesia rather than to that of music as a cultural phenomenon, in Erich Hornbostel’s sense...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Feminists are {{starting}} {{to look to the}} work of Pierre Bourdieu, in the hope that it might provide a useful framework for conceptualizing the tension between structure and agency in questions of gender. This article argues that Bourdieu’s analysis of gender can indeed be useful to feminists, but that the options Bourdieu offers for change are problematic. The article suggests that Bourdieu’s analysis of gender echoes the work of earlier radical feminists, particularly Catharine MacKinnon, in important ways. Consciousness-raising, one of MacKinnon’s strategies for change, <b>sits</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Bourdieu’s concept of habitus, despite Bourdieu’s own scepticism. The article argues that recasting the role of consciousness-raising in Bourdieu’s theory helps to undermine the deterministic elements of his work. It concludes that a feminist turn to Bourdieu as an attempt to understand gender’s entrenchment-and-malleability can be fruitful, and that such a turn might find a re-engagement with the idea of consciousness-raising helpful...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} is {{an investigation}} into the structure of Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s modal propositions through careful attention to the text of the Prior Analytics. I take account not only of recent attempts to formalize Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s modal syllogistic but also of the discussion that Aristotle himself provides about modal statements. I provide evidence that his modal propositions are to be construed in a de re manner and then go on to investigate the problems raised by a de re analysis, particularly those problems concerned with Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s modal conversion principles. A large part of my project is to show that these can be given a valid de re analysis that <b>sits</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> the results Aristotle sketches. Terms in modal syllogistic premises are shown to be restricted in ways that reflect Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s early metaphysics and notions of predication. ...|$|R

He does not seem content to rest late in his career when he had attained wealth and comfort and continued travelling locally, walking the streets of London in the mould of the flâneur, a 'gentleman stroller of city streets'. He often suffered from insomnia and his night-time wanderings gave him an insight into some of the hidden aspects of Victorian London, details of which he also incorporated into his novels.|$|R
40|$|The Institute for Housing and Urban Research Housing and Urban Researchers (HURs) {{are under}} intensifying {{pressures}} to impact on society. Although this orientation towards research impact <b>sits</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> “policy oriented” HURs, it has sat less <b>well</b> <b>with</b> some “critical” HURs. It would nevertheless {{be wrong to}} paint critical HURs as unconcerned with research impact. Debates about research impact {{led to the emergence}} of “critical” Housing and Urban Research (HUR) in the first place. Critical HURs simply seek to ensure that their research impacts in different ways. In fact, this is the problem. Policy and critically oriented HURs both presume social science to be an appropriate vehicle for impacting social change. Yet, such presumptions were questioned in my 'Fallacy paper', which was philosophically hostile to the idea of social scientific HUR which it sought to dethrone. However, it stopped short of outlining an alternative to it. This paper addresses this lacuna by suggesting an anarchist approach to impacting social change that is equally suspicious of social scientific HUR but, unlike the 'Fallacy paper', conciliatory towards it...|$|R
40|$|I am a {{landscape}} architect, a non-photographer, and in reviewing this exhibition, {{it seems that}} in a critical discourse on photography {{the nature of the}} view and its relation to the observer (presumably the camera) is inevitably a key focus of creative inquiry, in an epistemological sense. In conducting such a review, of 'self-portraits' by 'female photographers' in relation to 'the landscape', one cannot help but ask what priority this critique should allocate to each of these conceptual agendas, quite apart from the simple formal quality of the individual pieces themselves. Analytically, each could form the axes of a matrix that might allow for a number of quite different permutations and therefore differently conclusive commentaries on the others: the view vs landscape; the view vs sexuality; the self-portrait vs the landscape picture. All of these would be productive in their own right and each is alluded to in the works themselves and in the narrative of the catalogue. Considering this range of possible permutations, this show is certainly rich and this richness <b>sits</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> the relative formal saturation of the images themselves...|$|R

He had yet to enter university when he contributed a poem {{on the death of}} Henry Lord Hastings to the many other tributes published in Lachrymae Musarum (1649).
