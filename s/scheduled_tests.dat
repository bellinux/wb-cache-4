There is a need to consider power and resource constraints while developing the <b>test</b> <b>schedule.</b> This thesis consists of two parts. In the rst part, three test time calculation approaches, namely session-based <b>test</b> <b>schedule</b> with a xed scan path, session-based <b>test</b> <b>schedule</b> with a recongurable scan path, and session-less <b>test</b> <b>schedule</b> with a recongurable scan path are proposed.

These are the first premixed gas combustion experiments to be performed in space. Two of the fifteen <b>scheduled</b> <b>tests</b> were successfully completed on this shortened mission. Two different types of mixtures were burned, and both burned much longer than expected based on prior theoretical understanding. From these tests, two new insights were obtained, namely on the buoyancy-induced drift speed and repulsion of adjacent flame balls due to their mutual interaction. Preliminary results from the STS- 94 /MSL- 1 reflight are also presented, which show a remarkable sensitivity of the flame balls to small accelerations resulting from Orbiter attitude control maneuvers. Comparison of experimental results to computational predictions reveals limitations in current models of H 2 -O 2 chemistry for very lean mixtures.

40|$|Research on {{variables}} {{related to}} test performance has produced mixed results. Typically, research of this type involves only a few variables. In an attempt to obtain a more complete picture, we investigated how test grades {{might be related to}} variables such as classification, student seating location, test completion time, predicted grade, time spent studying, and perceived test difficulty. Undergraduate students in five courses completed their regularly <b>scheduled</b> <b>tests</b> and responded to demographic questions as well as questions about test difficulty, time spent studying and predicted grade. The results revealed that test grades were positively correlated with students ’ predicted grade. Test grades were negatively correlated with test completion time and with perceived test difficulty. Test grades were not correlated with students ’ reported study times. Other relationships among the variables are discussed. University instructors and researchers alike continually search for variables to help predict student test scores. This is an important area to investigate because understanding which variables are correlated with student test scores can help with instructional decision-making. Variables such as time taken to complete a test, student seating location and perception of test difficulty have all been discussed as possible predictors for test scores (e. g., Feinberg, 2004; Hong & Karstensson, 2002; Perkins & Wieman, 2005).

40|$|Although widely practiced, {{assessment}} {{is not just}} about the assessment of learning - the learning proof, which emphasises <b>scheduled</b> <b>tests</b> and written papers for institutional, summative grading purposes. Grades are often a normalised, comparative performance measure, and are rarely an exact representation of an individuals’ learning journey. High stakes assessment can create student “backwash,” a term used by Biggs and Tang (2007) to describe the process of students learning only enough to complete the task. This type of learning is often surface, measuring declarative knowledge (Earl, 2003). One approach to promote learning is to design assessment for learning -formative assessment/feedback, into the Learning and Teaching activities. The emphasis here is on the teacher guiding the learning of the student through the provision of regular formative feedback. By using a scaffolded approach to learning, teachers use constructivist pedagogy to facilitate deep learning, by aligning formative learning tasks to summative assessment events (Biggs and Tang, 2007). It requires students to take action in their learning and teachers to respond with thoughtful questions and responses (Young, 2005). This approach allows students to make mistakes and learn from misjudgements or lack of knowledge before assessment of learning occurs. Another method is utilising assessment as learning, where self-{{assessment is}} a reflective tool spurring student action (Young, 2005) – or self-reasoning. The emphasis is on what the student assesses they need to learn and accomplish in order to fill gaps in their knowledge and abilities. Student metacognition (Earl, 2003) drives their authentic, independent learning in an iterative cycle. Similar to assessment for learning, the teacher, peers and other stakeholders provide directions and feedback (Young, 2005). In combination, this approach is highly student centred. This poster considers the who, what, when, how and why of three different assessment approaches – of, for, as – and the effect these have on student learning – a question to consider; is there room in a course’s curriculum design for all three...|$|E
40|$|The tubular SOFC {{generator}} CHP- 100, {{built by}} Siemens Power Generation (SPG) Stationary Fuel Cells (SFC), is running at the Gas Turbine Technologies (GTT) in Torino (Italy), {{in the framework}} of the EOS Project. The nominal load of the generator ensures a produced electric power of around 105 kWe ac and around 60 kWt of thermal power at 250 ◦C to be used for the custom tailored HVAC system. Several experimental sessions have been scheduled on the generator; the aim is to characterize the operation through the analysis of some global performance index and the detailed control of the operation of the different bundles of the whole stack. All the <b>scheduled</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed by applying the methodology of design of experiment; the main obtained results show the effect of the change of the analysed operating factors in terms of distribution of voltage and temperature over the stack. Fuel consumption tests give information about the sensitivity of the voltage and temperature distribution along the single bundles. On the other hand, since the generator is an air cooled system, the results of the tests on the air stoichs have been used to analyze the generator thermal management (temperature distribution and profiles) and its effect on the polarization. The sensitivity analysis of the local voltage to the overall fuel consumption modifications {{can be used as a}} powerful procedure to deduce the local distribution of fuel utilization (FU) along the single bundles: in fact, through a model obtained by deriving the polarization curve respect to FU, it is possible to link the distribution of voltage sensitivities to FC to the distribution of the local FU. The FU distribution will be shown as non-uniform, and this affects the local voltage and temperatures, causing a high warming effect in some rows of the generator. Therefore, a discussion around the effectiveness of the thermal regulation made by the air stoichs, in order to reduce the non-uniform distribution of temperature and the overheating (increasing therefore the voltage behavior along the generator) has been performed. It is demonstrated that the utilization of one air plenum is not effective in the thermal regulation of the whole generator, in particular in the reduction of the temperature gradients linked to the non-uniform fuel distributio...|$|E

The mastery of motor skills {{is considered one of the}} potential factors that facilitate PA engagement. Fundamental movement skills (FMS) are foundations for developing context-specific movements. Children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) exhibit delays in motor skills including FMS and experience restrictions in PA participation. However, few studies have examined whether improvements in FMS proficiency promote PA engagement in children with DCD. PURPOSE: To determine the effect of FMS training on PA in children with DCD when compared to typically developing (TD) children. METHODS: Participants consist of 84 children (7 - 10 yrs) who were allocated into either FMS training (22 DCD-FMS, 17 TD-FMS) or control group who underwent regular physical education lessons (16 DCD-C, 29 TD-C). FMS training was conducted in a school setting for six weeks, twice per week and 35 minutes per session. FMS were tested using the Test of Gross Motor Development-Second edition. PA was subsequently monitored using accelerometers over seven consecutive days. Each participant attended all <b>scheduled</b> <b>tests</b> three times (i. e., before intervention, 1 -week post intervention, 6 -week post intervention). Repeated-measured ANCOVA was used to determine the intervention effect utilizing baseline scores and other key confounders as covariates. RESULTS: The DCD-FMS group scored significantly better in jumping (1 -week: 6. 09 ± 1. 85 vs. 3. 69 ± 1. 99, p< 0. 05) and catching (1 -week: 5. 23 ± 0. 87 vs. 4. 19 ± 1. 64, p< 0. 05; 6 -week: 5. 45 ± 0. 72 vs. 4. 31 ± 1. 58, p< 0. 05) than the DCD-C group. The TD-FMS group scored significantly poorer in jumping (1 -week: 5. 41 ± 1. 84 vs. 6. 52 ± 1. 70, p< 0. 05) than the TD-C group. The DCD-FMS group showed significantly lower PA volume (393. 06 ± 64. 50 vs. 431. 72 ± 87. 53 counts/min, p< 0. 05) and spent more time in sedentary pursuits (52. 54 ± 6. 55 vs. 50. 40 ± 7. 22 %, p< 0. 05) in the follow-up test than in the posttest. No significant difference in PA levels was found among groups. CONCLUSION: Children with DCD improved their FMS proficiency after receiving FMS training. However, the improvements in FMS performance in children with DCD did not transfer into improving their PA participation. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

Reducing test cost by minimizing the overall test time {{is one of the}} main goals of System-on-Chip (SoC) <b>test</b> <b>scheduling.</b> <b>Testing</b> of a SoC consists of testing all its cores such that the peak power consumption of each core as well as that of the entire SoC remain under specified limits.

To overcome this difficulty, heuristic methods capable of providing near-optimal solutions are developed.
