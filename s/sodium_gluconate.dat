Calcium and lactate {{are present in}} excess of their solubility in Cheddar cheese. Consequently, calcium lactate crystals are a common defect in Cheddar cheese. A novel approach for preventing calcium lactate crystals is the addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate.</b> <b>Sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> {{has the potential to}} increase the solubility of calcium and lactate by forming soluble complexes with calcium and lactate ions, and preventing them from being available for the formation of calcium lactate crystals. This research project was to determine the efficacy of <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> as a calcium lactate crystal inhibitor in Cheddar cheese. The first part {{of this study was to}} determine if <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> could increase the solubility of calcium lactate. Seven calcium lactate solutions (5. 31 % w/w) with seven levels of <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> (0, 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2, 3, and 4 % w/w) were made in triplicate. Solutions were stored at 7 °C for 21 days, and were visually inspected for calcium lactate crystal formation. Subsequently, they were filtered to remove calcium lactate crystals and the supernatant was analyzed for lactic acid and gluconic acid by HPLC and for calcium by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. The visual inspection demonstrated that calcium lactate crystals were formed in the solution with 0 % gluconate after the first day of storage and calcium lactate crystals continued to accumulate over time. A minute amount of calcium lactate crystals was also visible in the solution with 0. 5 % gluconate after 21 days of storage, while calcium lactate crystals were not visible in the other solutions. The HPLC results indicated that there was a higher concentration of calcium and lactic acid in the filtrate from the solutions containing added gluconate. Thus, <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> can increase the solubility of calcium lactate. The second part of this study was to determine the manufacture and composition of Cheddar cheeses with different levels of <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> addition. Six Cheddar cheeses with two levels of salting (2 and 2. 5 %) and three <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> addition levels (0, 0. 5 and 1 %) were manufactured. All cheeses were made using a stirred-curd procedure and replicated three times. Two levels were obtained by dividing cheese curd (at pH 5. 6) into two equal-weight halves; each half was salted with 2 and 2. 5 % (by weight of cheese curd) sodium chloride. Subsequently, each of the salted halves was separated into three equal-weight batches and mixed with 0 (control), 0. 5, and 1. 0 % <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate,</b> respectively. After <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> addition, the curds were hooped, pressed for 16 hour, vacuum-sealed in polyethylene bags, and transferred to a ripening room at 6 to 8 °C. After 1 week of storage, compositional analyses (pH, moisture, salt, fat and protein) and gluconic acid concentration were determined. Mean pH, moisture, salt, fat and protein content of the cheeses ranged from 5. 06 to 5. 32, 36. 98 to 38. 15 %, 1. 65 to 2. 13 %, 30. 96 to 32. 98 %, and 25. 6 to 26. 1 %, respectively. At both salting levels, the pH and moisture contents were significantly (p< 0. 05) increased in the treatments with added <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate.</b> The concentration of gluconic acid in the low salt treatments was 0. 33 and 0. 59 % for the 0. 5 and 1. 0 % addition level, respectively, whereas the concentration in the high salt levels was 0. 33 and 0. 58 %, respectively. The third part of this study was to determine if the level and type of residual sugar and organic acids produced during ripening was impacted by <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> addition to Cheddar cheeses. Six cheeses with two salting rates (2 and 2. 5 %) and three <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> addition levels (0, 0. 5 and 1 %) were manufactured. The cheeses were analyzed for lactose and water-soluble organic acids (acetic, butanoic, citric, formic, gluconic, lactic, orotic, propanoic, and uric) at 1 -week, 3 -month and 6 -month, 9 -month, and 12 -month of ripening by using a cation-exchange-column HPLC externally equipped with a refractive index detector. The organic acids were detected using the UV detector set at 210 and 285 nm, and the refractive index was used for quantification of lactose. The results indicated that at 1 -week of ripening, Cheddar cheeses with a higher concentration of gluconic acid had lower concentration of lactic acid, but higher concentration of lactose, while there were no differences in acetic, butanoic, citric, formic, orotic, propanoic and uric acids among treatments at all ripening times. The concentrations of butanoic and propanoic acids gradually increased over time in all treatments, whereas the concentrations of orotic acid and lactose gradually decreased over time. Minor changes in the levels of acetic, citric, formic, lactic, and uric were also observed throughout ripening in all treatments. The fourth part of this study was to determine the effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> on pH, lactose, lactic acid, and WSC changes during Cheddar cheese ripening. Six Cheddar cheeses with two salting levels (2 and 2. 5 %) and three <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> levels (0, 0. 5 and 1 %) were manufactured in triplicate. Composition and chemical analysis was performed at 1 week of ripening, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of ripening. Cheeses were analyzed for pH, lactose and lactic acid, and WSC. Compositional analyses at 1 week indicated that <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> addition had a significant effect on cheese pH, moisture, Na, lactose, and lactic acid. Cheddar cheeses from both 2 % and 2. 5 % salt levels with 0. 5 and 1. 0 % <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> exhibited higher pH than the control cheeses throughout the ripening time. HPLC results from Cheddar cheeses from both 2 % and 2. 5 % salt levels indicated that cheeses with higher concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> addition had a higher concentration of lactose, but lower concentration of lactic acid when compared to the control cheeses throughout the ripening time. WSC results indicated that Cheddar cheeses from both 2 % and 2. 5 % salt levels with higher concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> addition had lower WSC concentration when compared to the control cheeses throughout the ripening time. From the results, we concluded that <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> could have an effect on starter culture activity and could also act as buffering agent, which would cause a higher cheese pH. A higher cheese pH resulted in less soluble of calcium in the cheese serum; thus, resulting in less calcium and lactate ions in the cheese serum. The final part of this study was to determine the effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> on the extent of proteolysis, textural properties and sensory evaluation during Cheddar cheese ripening. Six Cheddar cheeses with two salting levels (2 and 2. 5 %) and three <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> levels (0, 0. 5 and 1 %) were manufactured in triplicate. Cheeses were analyzed for the extent of proteolysis by measuring pH 4. 6 soluble N and 12 % TCA soluble N at 3, 6, 9, and 12 -month of ripening. Textural properties were determined by Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) using a TA. XTplus Texture Analyzer at 3, 6, 9, and 12 -month of ripening. TPA parameters generated were fracturability, hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, chewiness, and resilience. Descriptive sensory analysis was used to monitor Cheddar cheese flavors in this study at 6 and 12 -month of ripening. An increase in soluble N and decreases in textural properties (fracturability, hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, gumminess, chewiness, and resilience) were observed throughout the ripening time for all treatments. At both salting levels, cheeses with added <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> exhibited a trend for a higher level of proteolysis and lower TPA hardness at 6 and 9 months. The overall flavor intensity scores at 6 months of ripening were lower in cheeses with added <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate,</b> which could relate to their lower bitterness scores. A similar trend was observed at 12 months of ripening, where cheeses with <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> addition had lower overall flavor intensity and lower bitterness scores.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Appropriate {{therapeutic}} management of {{iron deficiency anemia}} (IDA) is essential to prevent serious health risks and indiscriminate exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions. Iron therapy is administered intravenously in patients failing to respond to oral iron treatment or needing rapid iron repletion. Several parenteral iron carbohydrate complex formulations are now available, classified as stable, such as ferric carboxymaltose, or labile, such as <b>sodium</b> ferric <b>gluconate,</b> according to the release rate of iron, directly taken up by transferrin and other proteins. The first one preparations allow clinically well-tolerated administration of a single much higher dose of intravenous iron by more rapid infusion than the second one and various therapeutic areas can take advantages of their use, as appropriate therapy for IDA correction. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS. In this retrospective study, we considered 346 patients with IDA, eligible for the intravenous treatment. 222 patients (group A) received {{an average of three}} intravenous injections of ferric carboxymaltose (500 mg / visit), other 124 patients (group B) received an average of ten infusions of <b>sodium</b> ferric <b>gluconate</b> (62, 5 mg / visit). Patients were assessed at first visit and at least after 2, 5 and 7 weeks {{from the beginning of the}} treatment. The primary endpoint was the difference in the mean Hb, ferritin and transferrin saturation values detected throughout the whole observation period between the two treatment groups. Drug-related adverse events and transfusion need were also evaluated. RESULTS. Significantly lower baseline levels of Hb, ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were detected in group A, than in group B. Nevertheless, we found a faster and greater Hb, ferritin and TSAT increase with ferric carboxymaltose dosing regimen compared with <b>sodium</b> ferric <b>gluconate.</b> Throughout the whole observational period, group A showed a mean Hb level of 11, 3 g/dL (95 % CI 11, 1 – 11, 6), a mean ferritin level of 221, 1 ng/mL (95 % CI 184, 4 – 257, 7) and a mean TSAT of 20, 7 % (95 % CI 18, 9 – 22, 5); group B showed a mean Hb level of 10, 6 g/dL (95 % CI 10, 4 – 10, 8), a mean ferritin level of 85, 4 ng/mL (95 % CI 50, 9 – 119, 9) and a mean TSAT of 14, 1 % (95 % CI 11, 8 – 16, 4). After drug administration, statistical analysis showed a significant difference between the two groups in terms of mean Hb level (0, 74 g/dL, 95 % CI 0, 42 – 1, 06, p< 0, 0001), mean ferritin level (135, 7 ng/mL, 95 % CI 85, 3 – 186, 1, p< 0, 0001) and mean TSAT (6, 6 %, 95 % CI 3, 7 – 9, 6, p< 0, 0001). The occurrence of intravenous iron-related adverse drug effects was very low and the difference among the two groups was not statistically significant (p= 0, 8). No serious adverse events were witnessed. Patients requiring transfusions after the beginning of the treatment decreased and were 1. 4 % in group A and 4. 8 % in group B (p= 0, 05). Even patients with baseline Hb ≤ 8 g/dL showed a greater increase in Hb concentration in group A compared to group B and a very low proportion of them needed transfusions. CONCLUSION. The results of this study suggest that ferric carboxymaltose can be used safely and more effectively than <b>sodium</b> ferric <b>gluconate</b> to rapidly improve and maintain raised Hb concentration and TSAT values after drug withdrawal in patients with iron-restricted erythropoiesis, avoiding their exposure to the potential risks of untreated anemia, unnecessary transfusions or both...|$|R

Due to a previously observed positive effect by <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> on low-fat cheese flavor, each replicate was split into treatments of 0. 0 % and 0. 8 % <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate.</b> Each of these treatments was then split into ripening temperature treatments: 6 °C for 21 ± 1 wk; or 6 °C for 3 wk, 10 °C for 8 wk, and 6 °C for 10 wk. Cheese was tasted first by an informal panel. The 4 treatment combinations for the control cheese and the CR 540 (a Lactococcus lactis ssp. and Lactobacillus ssp. blend) cheese, along with all culture combinations containing <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> and ripened only at 6 °C, were selected for descriptive analysis. Some statistically significant differences in culture treatment were observed. <b>Sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> addition had {{a positive influence on}} flavor while elevated ripening temperature resulted in undesirable flavor notes. Low-fat (5 %) Cheddar cheese with the CR 540 adjunct with and without <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> was evaluated in a consumer taste panel with commercial full-fat (33 % fat) and commercial reduced-fat (25 % fat) Cheddar cheese.

Undesirable low molecular weight iron complexes, at concentration about 3 % in the pharmaceutical formulation, can be easily determined with good accuracy and precision. This methodology can be proposed as a viable, environmentally sustainable substitute for the conventional Normal Pulse Polarographic method in US Pharmacopeia, with better analytical figures of merit, and reduced Hg consumption. A deeper insight in Fe(II) and Fe(III) composition can be gained by the combined use of a new potentiometric technique after chemical decomposition of the complex.

40|$|The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are organic cations {{that are}} {{required}} for cell growth and differentiation. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, catalyzes the conversion of ornithine to putrescine. As the polyamine biosynthetic pathway {{is essential for the}} growth and survival of Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, inhibition of the pathway is an important leishmaniacidal strategy. In the present study, we examined {{for the first time the}} effects of 3 -aminooxy- 1 -aminopropane (APA), an ODC inhibitor, on the growth of L. donovani. APA inhibited the growth of both promastigotes in vitro and amastigotes in the macrophage model, with the 50 % inhibitory concentrations being 42 and 5 mu M, respectively. However, concentrations of APA up to 200 mu M did not affect the viability of macrophages. The effects of APA were completely abolished by the addition of putrescine or spermidine. APA induced a significant decrease in ODC activity and putrescine, spermidine, and trypanothione levels in L. donovani promastigotes. Parasites were transfected with an episomal ODC construct, and these ODC overexpressers exhibited significant resistance to APA and were concomitantly resistant to <b>sodium</b> antimony <b>gluconate</b> (Pentostam), indicating a role for ODC overexpression in antimonial drug resistance. Clinical isolates with <b>sodium</b> antimony <b>gluconate</b> resistance were also found to overexpress ODC and to have significant increases in putrescine and spermidine levels. However, no increase in trypanothione levels was observed. The ODC overexpression in these clinical isolates alleviated the antiproliferative effects of APA. Collectively, our results demonstrate that APA is a potent inhibitor of L. donovani growth and that its leishmaniacidal effect is due to inhibition of ODC...|$|R
30|$|It {{had been}} {{reported}} that bulk of the key enzyme (GOD) for gluconate synthesis was localized in the cell wall, demonstrating that <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> was formed around the cell wall (Witteveen et al. 1992). If much more amounts of GOD could depart from cell wall, then the contacting area with substrate would be expanded, which would have positive effects on <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> secretion. However, free GOD activity had similar trends to those of total GOD activity (Fig.  4 b), implying that the ratio of free/total GOD activity was independent on initial condition, meaning that the cells could self-stabilize GOD status under different osmotic conditions.|$|E
30|$|Biochemical {{analysis}} of RLs biosynthesis {{is confirmed by}} TLC. The wild type strain of T. thermophilus HB 8 make all RL biosynthetic intermediates under the described growth conditions and produces two α-thymol positive spots-mainly the slow-migrating spot, which represents di-RLs (Rf 0.125) and secondly the fast-migrating spot representing mono-RLs (Rf 0.56), {{in the presence of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate.</b> It is queer that in the presence of glucose only di-RLs was detected. This result is probably due to a quantitative difference of sample or a degradation of di-RLs to mono-RLs in the case of <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate.</b> Ramnose and saponin white were used as sample of reference (data not shown).|$|E
30|$|During <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate</b> {{production}} by A. niger, glucose, {{being one of}} the key substrates, had dual roles of acting as not only the carbon source for cell growth and metabolism, but also as the osmotic regulator in the medium. Previous study suggested that slightly higher osmolality was more conducive to produce <b>sodium</b> <b>gluconate,</b> whereas this paper systematically explored the effects of initial glucose concentration on seed culture by A. niger, and found that 300  g/L glucose, corresponding to 1900  mOsm/kg, was the optimal condition at seed stage. However, the glucose acting as carbon source or playing the increased penetration role during the process, still remained to be addressed.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The role of {{parenteral}} iron {{therapy has}} been expanding {{with the growing}} use of erythropoietin therapy. Much of the clinical experience {{regarding the use of}} IV iron therapy in combination with erythropoietin therapy is based on the hemodialysis patient, but the combination therapy has been used in other patient populations as well. In addition, parenteral iron may be indicated in patients receiving long-term parenteral nutrition and in other clinical situations of iron deficiency when the absorption of iron is impaired or tolerance limited. Once the indication for parenteral iron therapy is established, a selection of the most appropriate agent is required. There are currently 3 parenteral iron preparations available, including iron dextran, <b>sodium</b> ferric <b>gluconate,</b> and iron sucrose. Although all agents have been shown to b...|$|R
40|$|Serologic {{parameters}} of kala-azar {{were evaluated by}} Western blot analysis. Sera from kala-azar patients with confirmed diagnoses were screened for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG subclass-specific reactivity against Leishmania donovani membrane antigen (LAg). Heterogenous LAg-specific IgG reactivity with numerous proteins with molecular masses ranging from 18 to 190 kDa was observed. Though the individual band patterns were varied, seven polypeptides of approximately 31, 34, 51, 63, 72, 91, and 120 kDa were immunoreactive with all the sera tested from kala-azar patients. The band patterns of the immunoblots of sera from patients after treatment and clinical cure with <b>sodium</b> antimony <b>gluconate</b> revealed {{a decrease in the}} frequency of the bands.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{that the combination of}} sub-optimal doses of <b>Sodium</b> Antimony <b>Gluconate</b> (SAG) and the diperoxovanadate compound K[VO(O 2) 2 (H 2 O) ], also designated as PV 6, is highly effective in combating experimental infection of BALB/c mice with antimony resistant (SbR) Leishmania donovani (LD) as evident from the significant reduction in organ parasite burden where SAG is essentially ineffective. Interestingly, such treatment also allowed clonal expansion of antileishmanial T-cells coupled with robust surge of IFN-c and concomitant decrease in IL- 10 production. The splenocytes from the treated animals generated significantly higher amounts of IFN-c inducible parasiticidal effector molecules like superoxide and nitric oxide as compared to the infected group. Our study indicates that the combination of sub-optimal doses of SAG and PV 6 may be beneficial for the treatment of SAG resistant visceral leishmaniasis patients...|$|R
