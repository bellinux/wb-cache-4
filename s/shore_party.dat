5|$|On 2 March {{the ship}} {{departed}} for New Zealand to winter there, leaving a <b>shore</b> <b>party</b> of 10 with their provisions, equipment and 70 dogs. These {{were the first}} dogs brought to the Antarctic; likewise, the expedition pioneered the use there of the Primus stove, invented in Sweden six years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's second-in-command—although {{this was}} not {{clarified}} until the expedition reached the Antarctic—was Jameson Boyd Adams, a Royal Naval Reserve lieutenant who had turned down {{the chance of a}} regular commission to join Shackleton. He would also act as the expedition's meteorologist. Nimrods captain was another naval reserve officer, Rupert England; 23-year-old John King Davis, who would later make his own reputation as an Antarctic captain, was appointed chief officer at the last moment. Aeneas Mackintosh, a merchant navy officer from the P shipping line, was originally second officer, but was later transferred to the <b>shore</b> <b>party,</b> being replaced as second officer by A. E. Harbord. Others in the <b>shore</b> <b>party</b> were the two surgeons, Alistair Mackay and Eric Marshall, Bernard Day the motor expert, and Sir Philip Brocklehurst, the subscribing member who had been taken on as assistant geologist.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty also {{provided}} a largely naval , including the Antarctic veterans Edgar Evans, Tom Crean and William Lashly. Other seamen in the <b>shore</b> <b>party</b> included Patrick Keohane and Robert Forde, Thomas Clissold (cook) and Frederick Hooper (domestic steward). Two Russians, Dimitri Gerov (dog driver) and Anton Omelchenko (groom), also landed.|$|E
5000|$|Serving {{with the}} North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Commodore Jones {{operated}} in Virginia's rivers {{and on her}} coast from 11 May 1863. She performed picket and patrol duty, dragged for torpedoes (mines), skirmished with enemy cavalry, shelled shore installations, and captured contraband goods with her <b>shore</b> <b>parties.</b>|$|R
50|$|Capt. Clarke created hydrographic, maintenance, medical, and {{communications}} training programs, and a section to train Army <b>shore</b> <b>parties</b> how to unload landing craft. He {{set up a}} training facility at Solomons Island, and held exercises {{on the shores of}} the Chesapeake Bay around the clock, day and night.|$|R
2500|$|During Operation Neptune the {{standard}} operating procedure for [...] "Shore Fire Control Parties" [...] (SFCP) called for nine per infantry division. A naval gunfire liaison officer was attached to each regimental fire control center. A naval gunfire officer was attached to each divisional headquarters {{in charge of all}} <b>shore</b> <b>parties</b> in his division.|$|R
5|$|A greater misfortune {{occurred}} {{at the onset of}} the southern winter when the Aurora, locked in an ice-floe which broke off from the main shelf, was torn from its moorings. The ocean currents then pulled ship further away from the sledding parties marooned on shore and drifted for over six months before breaking free of the ice. Sadly the Aurora's damaged rudder forced her to return to New Zealand rather than returning for the stranded <b>shore</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{arriving}} in McMurdo Sound on 29 January 1908, Nimrods progress southward to the Discovery base at Hut Point {{was blocked by}} frozen sea. Shackleton decided {{to wait a few}} days {{in the hope that the}} ice would break up. During this delay, second officer Aeneas Mackintosh suffered an accident that led to the loss of his right eye. After emergency surgery by Marshall and Mackay, he was forced to relinquish his <b>shore</b> <b>party</b> place and go back to New Zealand with Nimrod. He recovered sufficiently to return with the ship in the following season.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before 10:50, Berk-i Satvet sent a <b>shore</b> <b>party</b> to {{warn the}} defenceless {{population}} of Novorossiysk, before opening up with her guns. She was soon thereafter joined by Midilli, which had been busy laying mines in the Kerch Strait. Midilli fired a total of 308 shells, sinking several Russian grain cargo ships and destroying about 50 oil tanks. On {{their way back to}} Ottoman territory, Midillis crew attempted to cut Sebastopol's undersea telegraph cable with Varna, Bulgaria, but failed.|$|E
50|$|The German vessel's {{main battery}} cannot {{be brought to}} bear on Brown, and he is able to pick off exposed crew-members who are trying to repair her {{punctured}} hull plates. The anchorage is an impenetrable tangle of scrub and thorn bushes, making it difficult for <b>shore</b> <b>parties</b> to run him to ground.|$|R

5|$|The brigade's Korean War {{organization}} was a 4,725-man force based around the 5th Marine Regiment {{and supported by}} Marine Aircraft Group 33, including military police, reconnaissance and intelligence companies. The attack force included the 1st Battalion, 2nd Battalion and 3rd Battalion of the 5th Marine Regiment as well as supporting companies from the 1st Combat Engineer Battalion, 1st Medical Battalion, 1st Motor Transport Battalion, 1st Ordnance Battalion, 1st Service Battalion, 1st <b>Shore</b> <b>Party</b> Battalion, 1st Signal Battalion, 1st Tank Battalion, 1st Amphibian Tractor Company, and 1st Combat Service Group.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December 1914, Shackleton's {{expedition}} ship Endurance left South Georgia for the Weddell Sea, on {{the first}} stage of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. It was making for Vahsel Bay, the southernmost explored point of the Weddell Sea at 77° 49' S, where a <b>shore</b> <b>party</b> was to land and prepare for a transcontinental crossing of Antarctica. Before it could reach its destination the ship was trapped in pack ice, and by 14 February 1915 was held fast, despite prolonged efforts to free her. During the following eight months she drifted northward until, on 27 October, she was crushed by the pack's pressure, finally sinking on 21 November.|$|E
5|$|On Shackleton's return home, public honours {{were quickly}} forthcoming. King Edward VII {{received}} him on 10 July and raised {{him to a}} Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO); in the King's Birthday Honours list in November, he was made a knight, becoming Sir Ernest Shackleton. He was honoured by the Royal Geographical Society, who awarded him a Gold Medal; a proposal that the medal be smaller than that earlier awarded to Captain Scott was not acted on. All {{the members of the}} Nimrod Expedition <b>shore</b> <b>party</b> received silver Polar Medals on 23 November, with Shackleton receiving a clasp to his earlier medal. Shackleton was also appointed a Younger Brother of Trinity House, a significant honour for British mariners.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{great care}} being {{taken over the}} {{anchorage}} the winter storms around Cape Evans proved too much, and {{on the night of}} 6 May she was wrenched from her moorings and taken out to sea with the ice. Aboard were 18 men, and most of the <b>shore</b> <b>party's</b> clothing, equipment and food. Ashore, stranded, were ten men, including Mackintosh.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the ensuing}} weeks, Whitewood reconnoitered the coastal areas in Lancaster, Eclipse, and Jones Sounds, and Prince Regent, Admiralty, and Navy Board Inlets. Operating on this duty in company with Northwind, Whitewood landed <b>shore</b> <b>parties</b> {{that set up}} {{positions}} ashore to obtain terrestrial navigation [...] "fixes" [...] to dovetail with the photographic coverage obtained from the ships and planes of the project's task force.|$|R
50|$|Delarov's {{career in}} Russian America dates {{to at least}} 1764, {{when he was in}} the Aleutian Islands on board the Petr i Pavel under Ivan Maksimovich Solov'ev. Delarov participated in Solov'ev's 1764 attacks on the Umnak-Unalaska Aleut alliance, which were carried out in revenge for the 1762 Fox Islands revolt - a coordinated Aleut attack on four Russian vessels and several <b>shore</b> <b>parties,</b> during which over 300 Russians were killed.|$|R
5|$|When Atkinson {{arrived back}} at Cape Evans from the Beardmore Glacier {{at the end}} of January, he was the senior officer present and thus in command of the base camp, a role to which he was not accustomed. Terra Nova arrived from her winter mooring in New Zealand on 9 February, and instead of setting off for Scott, Atkinson used the <b>shore</b> <b>party</b> for the arduous task of {{unloading}} the ship – a mistake, Cherry-Garrard thought, since these men might be required to sledge again. Belatedly, on 13 February, Atkinson set out with Dimitri Gerov and the dog teams for the scheduled meeting with Scott on the Barrier, arriving and pausing at Hut Point on 19 February.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Austria-Hungary, Panther initially {{served with the}} main fleet. During this period, she visited Spain for the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition. Starting in the mid-1890s, the ship {{spent much of her}} time abroad. From 1896 to 1898, she was stationed in China, and she sent a <b>shore</b> <b>party</b> to help United States Marines protect US civilians during a riot. She went on a cruise in the Mediterranean in 1902, and in 1905, she visited East Africa. Panther was modernized in 19091910 and received a new gun armament. At the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, the ship was assigned to the Coastal Defense Special Group; these ships provided artillery support to an Austro-Hungarian Army attack in January 1916 that knocked Montenegro out of the war. The next year, Panther was withdrawn from frontline service and employed as a training ship. Awarded to Britain in the postwar division of war prizes, Panther was broken up for scrap in Italy in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{supply was}} entirely by sea. Amphibian scouts from the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR) of the US 2nd Engineer Special Brigade, wearing Australian uniforms, {{advanced}} with the infantry and reconnoitred beaches from the landward side {{as they were}} secured. If a beach looked suitable, a second reconnaissance was made from the sea. Once a beach was selected, a <b>shore</b> <b>party</b> was brought in by landing craft {{to set up an}} administrative area. Engineers improved the coastal track to enable supplies to units moving along it to be brought up by jeeps but supplies for units moving inland over the high ground had to be brought by native carriers. Artillery guns were brought forward over the tracks, or else were moved by Landing Craft Mechanised (LCMs) of the 532nd EBSR. Tanks normally moved along the tracks but used LCMs to bypass obstacles. As the advance continued, new beachheads were opened up while rearward ones were closed. The advance was halted on occasion to allow for the guns to be brought forward or sufficient supplies to be accumulated at the forward beachhead.|$|E
5000|$|Agents were {{inserted}} into Saaremaa, Estonia, Užava and Ventspils, Latvia, Palanga, Lithuania and Ustka, Poland, typically via Bornholm, Denmark where the final radio signal was given from London for the boats {{to enter the}} territorial waters claimed by the USSR. The boats proceeded to their destinations, typically several miles offshore, {{under cover of darkness}} and met with <b>shore</b> <b>parties</b> in dinghies' returning agents were received at some of these [...]|$|R
5000|$|The first European {{visitors}} to the coast of California were Spanish maritime explorers led by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, who spent several days around the Channel Islands in 1542 before sailing farther north. It's quite possible that one of Cabrillo's <b>shore</b> <b>parties</b> landed at Dos Pueblos Creek to take on fresh water. If so, they would have met the Chumash {{people who lived in}} two towns {{on either side of the}} creek.|$|R
5000|$|Reist Rocks (...) is a {{small group}} of rocks on the Antarctic coast, 8 {{nautical}} miles (15 km) west of Snyder Rocks. First mapped from air photos taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump (1946-47). Named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Wilbur H. Reist, tractor driver with U.S. Navy Operation Windmill (1947-48), who assisted in transporting <b>shore</b> <b>parties</b> that established astronomical control stations from Wilhelm II Coast to Budd Coast.|$|R
5|$|Bligh {{hoped to}} find water and food on Tofua, then proceed to the nearby island of Tongatapu to seek help from King Poulaho (whom he knew from his visit with Cook) in {{provisioning}} the boat for a voyage to the Dutch East Indies. Ashore at Tofua, there were encounters with natives who were initially friendly but grew more menacing as time passed. On 2 May, four days after landing, Bligh realised that an attack was imminent. He directed his men back to the sea, shortly before the Tofuans seized the launch's stern rope and attempted to drag it ashore. Bligh coolly shepherded {{the last of his}} <b>shore</b> <b>party</b> and their supplies into the boat. In an attempt to free the rope from its captors, the quartermaster John Norton leapt into the water; he was immediately set upon and stoned to death.|$|E
5|$|On 23 March, Cormoran {{returned}} to Sydney {{for yet another}} annual overhaul. Afterward, she resumed her typical cruising duties in the German Pacific colonies. In September, she and the steamer Planet pulled free the Norwegian barque Fram, which had run aground. She received another major overhaul in Tsingtau in May 1912, which was followed by surveying cruises in the German colonies. She {{did not return to}} Apia until 10 January 1913. Cormoran was reclassified as a gunboat on 24 February 1913 by order of Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office). From 4 June to 5 July, she underwent repairs in Sydney. She was then obliged to stop in Bougainville due to tribal feuds on the island. She landed her <b>shore</b> <b>party</b> to assist the Polizeitruppen in suppressing the conflict. She departed for Tsingtau for further repair work in early 1914, arriving on 30 May.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{negotiated}} a truce, {{under the terms}} of which the Malagasy undertook to spare the lives of the surviving crew members. In exchange it was agreed that Meermin would return to Madagascar, where the Malagasy would be released. But gambling on the Malagasy's ignorance of navigation, the wounded Muller instead ordered his crew to head for the coast of southern Africa. After making landfall at Struisbaai, in the Cape Colony, which the Malagasy were assured was their homeland, 50–70 of them went ashore. Their intention was to signal to the others still on board Meermin if it was safe for them to follow, but the <b>shore</b> <b>party</b> soon found themselves confronted by a militia of farmers formed in response to Meermins arrival; the farmers had understood that as the ship was flying no flags, it was in distress.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{upcoming}} Battle of Saipan in June 1944, Davies {{participated in the}} landing on D-Day and made frequent visits of front lines under enemy fire to collect important information about landing crafts. He also inspected amphibian tractor units and <b>shore</b> <b>parties.</b> During the Battle of Tinian he accomplished the same tasks and subsequently received Legion of Merit with Combat [...] "V" [...] for his bravery under fire.|$|R
2500|$|Dawn {{found the}} Fedala landing beaches lashed by [...] waves which greatly impeded {{unloading}} the invasion troopships. Forty {{percent of the}} troops were ashore with barely one percent of their supplies. There were shortages of ammunition, and inadequate medical supplies for the wounded. Communications broke down because radio equipment was still aboard the troopships. The advance toward Casablanca halted because <b>shore</b> <b>parties</b> lacked mechanized equipment to move supplies off the landing beach.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 37,144 medals were awarded, of which 5,610 were awarded without a clasp. In respect of service during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879, any {{members of the}} {{military}} who had been mobilised in Natal but who had not crossed the Tugela River into Zululand, received the medal without a clasp. This included Naval <b>shore</b> <b>parties.</b> Since fighting was confined to the northern side of the Tugela, the no-clasp-medals are frequently viewed as non-combat awards.|$|R
5|$|When Mackintosh and the depot-laying party {{finally reached}} Cape Evans in mid-June, {{they learned that}} Aurora, with 18 men on board and {{carrying}} most of the shore party's supplies and equipment, had broken loose from its winter mooring during a gale. Ice conditions in McMurdo Sound {{made it impossible for}} the ship to return; the <b>shore</b> <b>party</b> of ten was effectively marooned, with drastically depleted resources. However, most of the stores required for the depots had been landed. Mackintosh therefore resolved that the following season's work would be carried out to the full: depots would be laid across the Great ice Barrier {{all the way to the}} Beardmore Glacier. The party would seek to make up its lack of supplies and equipment by salvaging the stores left by earlier expeditions, particularly from Captain Scott's recent sojourn at Cape Evans. The entire party pledged its support to this effort, though it would require, wrote Mackintosh, a record-breaking feat of polar travel to accomplish it. However, the long months of preparation were difficult for Mackintosh. The only officer in the party, he found it hard to form close relationships with his companions. His position became increasingly isolated, and subject to the frequent vocal criticisms of Joyce in particular.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of the engagement, Sydney had fired some 670rounds of ammunition, with around 100hits claimed. She had {{meanwhile}} been hit sixteen times; three of her crew were killed and thirteen were wounded. 134 German personnel were killed, {{with the rest of the}} ship's company were captured by Sydney (apart from a <b>shore</b> <b>party,</b> which commandeered the schooner Ayesha and escaped) and were delivered to British forces at Valletta, Malta. After leaving Malta, the Australian cruiser proceeded to join the North America and West Indies Station, arriving in Bermuda on 6 January 1915.|$|E
25|$|They withdrew {{overnight}} into Skull Creek, Georgia. The {{next day}} they sortied again. Under covering fires from Old Savannah engaging nearby heavy Union ships, the Sampson assisted in amphibious operations taking off numbers of the Port Royal garrison. Resolute, returning from delivering dispatches to the City of Savannah, evacuated the garrison at Fort Walker. She then landed at Pope’s Landing, Hilton Head Island, and spiked Confederate guns abandoned there. The Savannah landed a <b>shore</b> <b>party</b> of Marines to support Fort Beauregard under fire from Union warships, but the fort was lost before the reinforcements could arrive. The ship took off the garrison and returned to Savannah for repairs.|$|E
50|$|Against an {{estimated}} 395 Japanese {{killed in action}} during the operation, American ground casualties numbered 66 killed and 152 wounded. U.S. Navy loses were significantly higher: 644 deaths on the Liscome Bay, 43 killed in a turret fire on the battleship , and 10 killed in action with naval <b>shore</b> <b>parties</b> or as aviators, {{for a total of}} 697 naval deaths. The overall total of 763 American dead almost equalled the number of men in the entire Japanese garrison.|$|R
5000|$|St. Roch II {{also carried}} out {{a search for a}} {{reported}} wreck from Sir John Franklins expedition of 1845. Using a Kongsberg/Simrad SM2000 forward-looking sonar she completed a survey west of Grant Point on the Adelaide Peninsula. An area of [...] of previously uncharted sea floor was searched, but found nothing, and a survey by <b>shore</b> <b>parties</b> of the unnamed island southwest of Grant Point, and the northwestern point of Grant Point itself found nothing definitive.|$|R
50|$|From {{the spring}} of 1907 to 1910, Patton served in the Philippine Islands aboard two survey ships owned by the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands and {{operated}} by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, USC&GS Romblon and USC&GS Research. During this tour, he took part in hydrographic surveys of the Tañon Strait, the north coast of Negros, and the southeast coast of Luzon {{and was a member}} of <b>shore</b> <b>parties</b> engaged in surveys of Mindanao, Bohol, and Camiguin and nearby islets.|$|R
