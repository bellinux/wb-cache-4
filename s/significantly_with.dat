40|$|AIM: To {{research}} the correlation factor of the anterior segment values of eyes with different axial lengths. METHODS: In this study, 697 cases 697 eyes were included. According to axial length we divided {{all the cases}} into short axial length group, normal axial length group, mild long axial length group, moderate long axial length group and severe long axial length group. The relevant indicators of the anterior segment values of patients in the five groups was comparatively analyzed. RESULTS: In the short axial length group, the anterior chamber volume(ACV) showed a <b>significantly</b> negative correlation <b>with</b> age; anterior chamber depth(ACD) showed a <b>significantly</b> negative correlation <b>with</b> age. In the normal axial length group, the ACV showed a <b>significantly</b> negative correlation <b>with</b> age and a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation <b>with</b> axial length(AXL); the anterior chamber angle(ACA) showed a <b>significantly</b> negative correlation <b>with</b> age and a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation <b>with</b> AXL, and a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation <b>with</b> corneal curvature; the ACD showed a <b>significantly</b> negative correlation <b>with</b> age and a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation <b>with</b> AXL. In the mild long axial length group, the ACV showed a <b>significantly</b> negative correlation <b>with</b> age and a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation <b>with</b> AXL, and a <b>significantly</b> negative correlation <b>with</b> corneal curvature; the ACA showed a <b>significantly</b> negative correlation <b>with</b> age and a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation <b>with</b> AXL, and a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation <b>with</b> corneal curvature; the ACD showed a <b>significantly</b> negative correlation <b>with</b> age and a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation <b>with</b> AXL. In the moderate long axial length group, the ACV showed a <b>significantly</b> negative correlation <b>with</b> age; the ACA showed a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation <b>with</b> AXL; the ACD showed a <b>significantly</b> positive correlation <b>with</b> AXL.

5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has changed <b>significantly</b> <b>with</b> time as they grow over the hotspot and migrate away. Volcanic activity 14.5to 3.0million years ago was predominately felsic, producing large volumes of rhyolite and trachyte lava. This {{can be explained by}} the presence of thick granitic structures under these volcanoes, which have been tectonically compressed from being near the North American Plate margin. A unique characteristic of the felsic lava flows is that although they were high in silica content, the flows were overly fluid in nature. This is because the peralkaline content of these felsic lavas decreased the viscosity of the flows a minimum of 10â€“30times over that of calc-alkaline felsic flows. Evidence for explosive volcanism exists in the form of pumice flows, bedded tuffs, intensely shattered basement rocks and the high content of coarse basement clasts in rhyolite breccias.|$|E
