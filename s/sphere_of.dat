40|$|This paper {{describes}} the compressive crush behaviour <b>of</b> <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> closed-cell aluminium foams with different diameters (6, 8 and 10 mm) and square tubes filled with these <b>spheres.</b> The <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> closed-cell aluminium foams are net spherical shape fabricated via powder metallurgy methods by heating foamable precursor materials in a mould. The square tubes were filled by pouring the <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> closed-cell aluminium foams freely (without any bonding). The compressive crush performance of square tubes filled with <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> closed-cell aluminum foams {{were compared to}} that of the empty tubes. The results show a significant influence <b>of</b> the <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> closed-cell aluminium foam on the average crushing load of the square tubes. The energy absorption in the square tube filled with <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> closed-cell aluminium foam with diameters of 10 mm is higher than in the other square tubes. The <b>spheres</b> <b>of</b> closed-cell aluminium foams led to improvement of the energy absorption capacity of empty tubes...|$|R

He used his transit observation to help establish that Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun in Ptolemaic cosmology, i.e. the <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> Venus comes before the <b>sphere</b> <b>of</b> the Sun when moving out from the Earth in the prevailing geocentric model.|$|E

But as Singapore rapidly emerged as an important trading post, Britain consolidated its claim on the island.

In 1826, Singapore was grouped by the British East India Company together with Penang and Malacca to form the Straits Settlements, administered by the British East India Company.

Chinese and Islamic troops finally clashed at the Battle of Talas in 751. The Chinese lost against the Arabs, now under Abbasid rule, and the Arab army captured Chinese papermaking craftsmen.
