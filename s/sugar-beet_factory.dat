50|$|Upon {{his return}} to Ireland, Keogh was {{employed}} at the Poolbeg Generating Station in Dublin and the <b>sugar-beet</b> <b>factory</b> in Carlow. Keogh died in Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown in September 1964, survived by his wife.|$|E
50|$|Microbacterium kitamiense is a heterotrophic, {{strictly}} aerobic, mesophilic and non-motile bacterium {{from the}} genus of Microbacterium {{which has been}} isolated from waste water from a <b>sugar-beet</b> <b>factory</b> in Kitami in Japan. Microbacterium kitamiense produces polysaccharide. Microbacterium kitamiense has a high GC-content.|$|E
50|$|Although {{navigation}} {{is known}} to have taken place since at least the time of the Domesday Book, there is less documentary evidence than for other neighbouring rivers, as there was no centre of population {{at the head of the}} navigation. A <b>sugar-beet</b> <b>factory</b> was built on the banks in 1925 at Wissington, which could only be accessed by river or railway, and started a period of relative prosperity, which ended in 1943, when the first road to reach the factory was built. All use of the river is now by pleasure craft.|$|E
2500|$|Water {{resources}} are polluted by {{the discharge of}} untreated or insufficiently treated industrial and domestic wastewater, leaching from septic tanks, agricultural non-point sources such as pesticides and nitrates, hospital waste and domestic solid waste, {{as well as the}} discharge of motor oil. The Ghadir river in the South of Beirut is probably the most polluted river in the country, while the Wazzani River in South Lebanon may be the least polluted river because of limited economic activity in its basin. The discharge of untreated municipal and industrial effluents, the drainage from agricultural lands, and the uncontrolled discharge of solid wastes have considerably degraded the water quality of the [...] Qaraoun Lake and the Litani River. Untreated industrial effluents are discharged into the lake and river from <b>sugar-beet</b> <b>factories,</b> paper factories, lead recovery plants, limestone crushers, agro-industries, poultry farms, tanneries and slaughterhouses. According to a 1998 study by the National Council of Scientific Research of Lebanon for UNICEF 60â€“70% percent of all natural sources were affected by bacterial contamination. An example is the Jeita spring, which has witnessed an increase in fecal coliform bacteria.|$|R
40|$|Every {{year the}} Suiker Unie executes a {{so-called}} beet campaign {{in order to}} transport <b>sugar-beets</b> to the <b>factory.</b> Beetgrowing farmers are located in different regions from which a transport organization moves the beets to the factory by trucks. This supply continues 6. 5 days a week, {{with the exception of}} Sunday afternoon. Once the beets have arrived at the factory, they are put on stock waiting to be processed. This stock acts as a buffer, which is controlled by adjusting the time gap on Sunday afternoon. The Suiker Unie is interested in moving to a 24 / 7 supply scheme and thus a new method for the control of the buffer of <b>sugar-beets</b> on the <b>factory</b> site should be developed. This research therefore aims at setting up such a control strategy that will work in a 24 / 7 supply situation. It starts with the development of two mathematical models used to analyze the logistical process of supplying sugar-beets. These models provide insights into the relationship between different parameters. Furthermore, they serve as an input for a simulation model that is developed. The research is a first step to a more quantitative approach in setting up the beet campaign. ...|$|R
50|$|Methwold Lode {{flows in}} from the south, and the river is then {{constrained}} by wide flood banks {{on both sides of}} the river. Wissington bridge is relatively new, as there was no road access to the <b>sugar-beet</b> <b>factory</b> below it when it was built in 1925. The road to the factory has since been bypassed, with the newer bridge providing more headroom than the old. At Hilgay, the Cut-off Channel passes very close to the river, with Snowre Hall, a 15th-century building containing some of the earliest domestic brickwork in England on its northern bank.|$|E
50|$|Trade {{continued}} to the wharf at Oxborough Hithe and to another at Stoke Ferry {{until at least}} 1858, and may have continued for years afterwards, as the railway from Denver did not arrive until 1882. A barge called Wissey was operated by J Coston from Hilgay, which was known to have reached Cambridge in 1896 and 1898. In the 1930s, A Jackson was trading corn from Stoke Ferry, while {{one of the busiest}} times for the river was between 1925 and 1943. Wissington <b>sugar-beet</b> <b>factory</b> was opened in 1925, and until 1941 could only be reached by river or by the Wissington Light Railway, which crossed the river at {{the western edge of the}} factory. The site was then requisitioned by the Ministry of Agriculture who used Italian prisoners of war to refurbish the railway and construct roads to the factory. Three tugs, named Hilgay, Littleport and Wissington were used to pull a fleet of 24 steel barges, which were used to take the beet to King's Lynn during the winter months and to bring coal in the reverse direction during the summer.|$|E
