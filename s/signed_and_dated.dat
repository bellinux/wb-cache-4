5|$|Ingres was self-critical and {{consumed}} by self-doubt. He often took months {{to complete a}} portrait, leaving large periods of inactivity between sittings. With Bertin, he agonised in finding a pose to best convey both the man's restless energy and his age. At least seven studies survive, three are <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated.</b> Ingres was a master draftsman and the sketches, if not fully realised, are highly regarded in their own right. The sketches are exemplary in their handling of line and form, and similar in size.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} this information, it is {{unlikely}} that Cairano, at his death, was able to pass on an artistic legacy to assure the survival of his studio, despite having trained his son and other co-workers, as well as artists such as Ambrogio Mazzola, whose Madonna and Child, <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated</b> 1536 and preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, clearly shows the influence of Cairano's style from thirty years before. This appears to be a nostalgic and naive tribute to a master, who apparently had bequeathed an artistic footprint that his collaborators not only replicated tirelessly but also felt unable to evolve further.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} was <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated</b> at Boulogne on the 31 January 1308. At {{the top of}} the list of signatories was Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham and Patriarch of Jerusalem. He was followed by the four earls Lincoln, Pembroke, Surrey and Hereford, and five men of baronial families: Clifford, Payn Tybetot, Henry de Gray, John de Botetourt and John de Berwick. The document today exists in the Bodleian Library in Oxford, as a transcript made by the 17th-century antiquarian William Dugdale. Dugdale's transcript is believed to be based on an older document, which was probably lost in the Cotton library fire of 1731.|$|E

5000|$|The 1450 {{workshop}} archives in Pinerolo (where he was {{registered as}} a [...] "master artist") state that he traveled {{a great deal}} along the Maritime Alps, <b>signing</b> <b>and</b> <b>dating</b> his works.|$|R
25|$|At {{about this}} time the artist also began to <b>sign</b> <b>and</b> <b>date</b> his {{paintings}} more frequently. He also {{moved away from the}} large-format Grand Manner-influenced style and turned to smaller, more intimate portraits in which he focused more attention on the faces of his subjects.|$|R
5|$|The father {{panel is}} <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated</b> on both sides, {{in what may}} be the oldest extant {{instance}} of Dürer's signature monogram of a large open A and small d. However this inscription and the 1490 date are later additions. The Florence canvas is in relatively poor condition: retouching has largely removed Dürer's top layer of brushwork and left the paint hard and dry. Barbara's panel underwent a restoration in 1974, when the surface was cleaned and partially revarnished, with repairs to damage on the reverse sustained from woodboring.|$|E
25|$|Passy (Bridges of Paris) is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 60.5 x 73.2cm (23.8 by 28.8 inches), <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated</b> Alb Gleizes, 1914, lower left.|$|E

50|$|Pietro Vesconte (fl. 1310-1330) was a Genoese {{cartographer}} and geographer. A {{pioneer of}} the field of the portolan chart, he influenced Italian and Catalan mapmaking throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. He appears to have been the first professional mapmaker to <b>sign</b> <b>and</b> <b>date</b> his works regularly.|$|R
25|$|After {{returning}} from Rome in 1719, he began painting in his topographical style. His first known <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated</b> work is Architectural Capriccio (1723, Milan, {{in a private}} collection). Studying with the older Luca Carlevarijs, a moderately-talented painter of urban cityscapes, he rapidly became his master's equal.|$|E
25|$|Most of Sittow's {{paintings}} are not <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated</b> – the only painting {{that can be}} dated with certainty is the portrait of Christian II of Denmark.

25|$|He was an {{accomplished}} portrait painter, but lacked the flair {{of a master}} such as Van Dyck. His style varied considerably over his career, {{and he was able}} to assimilate new influences into his own style without any discordant effect. He was particularly accurate and detailed in his depiction of clothing. He was one of the few artists in England at this time who consistently <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated</b> their work.|$|E

25|$|La Femme aux Phlox is an oil {{on canvas}} with {{dimensions}} 81 x 100cm (31 by 39 inches) <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated</b> 'Alb Gleizes 10'. Created {{during the second half}} of 1910, the painting represents a woman sitting in an interior setting, with a vase of flowers (phloxes) in front and another to her left. The window behind the sitter opens out onto an exterior scene, the whole blurring the distinction between interior and exterior.|$|E
25|$|A {{fairly small}} number of {{landscape}} pen and wash drawings or watercolours made in England played {{an important part in}} introducing the Flemish watercolour landscape tradition to England. Some are studies, which reappear in the background of paintings, but many are <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated</b> and were probably regarded as finished works to be given as presents. Several of the most detailed are of Rye, a port for ships to the Continent, suggesting that van Dyck did them casually whilst waiting for wind or tide to improve.|$|E
25|$|Raphael had {{the good}} luck to be born {{the son of a}} painter, so his career path, unlike that of Michelangelo who was the son of minor nobility, was decided without a quarrel. Some years after his father's death he worked in the Umbrian {{workshop}} of Perugino, an excellent painter and a superb technician. His first <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated</b> painting, executed at the age of 21, is the Betrothal of the Virgin, which immediately reveals its origins in Perugino's Christ giving the Keys to Peter.|$|E
25|$|Since it {{is usually}} {{required}} that the suspects be asked if they understand their rights, courts have also ruled that any subsequent waiver of Miranda rights must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.

25|$|The St John Altarpiece (sometimes the Triptych {{of the two}} Saints John or the Triptych of St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist) is a large oil-on-oak hinged-triptych altarpiece {{completed}} around 1479 by the Early Netherlandish master painter Hans Memling. It {{was commissioned}} in the mid-1470s in Bruges for the Old St. John's Hospital (Sint-Janshospitaal) during {{the building of a}} new apse. It is <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated</b> 1479 on the original frame – its date of installation – and is today at the hospital in the Memling museum.|$|E
25|$|Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 146.4 x 114.4cm (57.6 by 45 inches), <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated</b> 'Albert Gleizes 1911' (lower right); signed again and titled 'Alb Gleizes Paysage' (on the reverse). This work, painted {{at the outset}} of 1911, represents a human figure walking through a hilly landscape with trees, houses or villas, a bridge over the Seine river, and a town with a church (possibly the Paroisse de Saint-Cloud) on the 'horizon', consistent with elements of the town in the southwestern suburbs of Paris, Meudon.|$|E
25|$|A {{teaching}} laboratory demonstration for {{the production}} of dry ice is to use a 15 lb aluminum carbon dioxide fire extinguisher with a porous fabric collecting bag over the nozzle. The Joule-Thomson expansion of the gas lowers the temperature enough to produce an approximate 50/50 mixture of CO2 gas and dry ice snow also called dust that is collected in the bag. This is an inefficient process, and unsuitable for even lab-scale production. The expansion is inefficient, fire extinguishers are an expensive way to buy carbon dioxide, especially when a <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated</b> fire extinguisher certification is required.|$|E

50|$|Renato Guttuso's father, Gioacchino Guttuso, was a land {{surveyor}} and amateur watercolourist. There {{are a number of}} portraits of Gioacchino in the collection donated to the mayor of Bagheria. Renato Guttuso began <b>signing</b> <b>and</b> <b>dating</b> his works at the age of thirteen. Guttuso lived close to a house amongst the Valguarnera villas and Palagonia, which he would soon represent in paintings inspired by the cliffs of Aspra.|$|R
25|$|All five {{versions}} of the picture are of roughly the same large size (2.6 x 2.2 m). Bonaparte appears mounted in the uniform of a general in chief, wearing a gold-trimmed bicorne, and armed with a Mamluk-style sabre. He is wreathed {{in the folds of}} a large cloak which billows in the wind. His head is turned towards the viewer, and he gestures with his right hand toward the mountain summit. His left hand grips the reins of his steed. The horse rears up on its back legs, its mane and tail whipped against its body by the same wind that inflates Napoleon's cloak. In background a line of the soldiers interspersed with artillery make their way up the mountain. Dark clouds hang over the picture and in front of Bonaparte the mountains rise up sharply. In the foreground BONAPARTE, HANNIBAL and KAROLVS MAGNVS IMP. are engraved on rocks. On the breastplate yoke of the horse, the picture is <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated.</b>|$|E
25|$|Petrus Christus’ {{portrait}} of a bride and groom visiting a goldsmith is a typical example of a transitional still life depicting both religious and secular content. Though mostly allegorical in message, the figures of the couple are realistic and the objects shown (coins, vessels, etc.) are accurately painted but the goldsmith is actually a depiction of St. Eligius and the objects heavily symbolic. Another similar type of painting is the family portrait combining figures with a well-set table of food, which symbolizes both the piety of the human subjects and their thanks for God’s abundance. Around this time, simple still-life depictions divorced of figures (but not allegorical meaning) were beginning to be painted {{on the outside of}} shutters of private devotional paintings. Another step toward the autonomous still life was the painting of symbolic flowers in vases on the back of secular portraits around 1475. Jacopo de’ Barbari went a step further with his Still Life with Partridge, Iron Gloves, and Crossbow Arrows (1504), among the earliest <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated</b> trompe-l'œil still-life paintings, which contains minimal religious content.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{documentation}} for attributions {{comes from}} the Venetian collector Marcantonio Michiel. In notes dating from 1525 to 1543 he identifies twelve paintings and one drawing as by Giorgione, of which five of the paintings are identified virtually unanimously with surviving works by art historians: The Tempest, The Three Philosophers, Sleeping Venus, Boy with an Arrow, and Shepherd with a Flute (not all accept the last as by Giorgione however). Michiel describes the Philosophers as having been completed by Sebastiano del Piombo, and the Venus as finished by Titian (it is now generally agreed that Titian did the landscape). Some recent art historians also involve Titian in the Three Philosophers. The Tempest is therefore {{the only one of}} the group universally accepted as wholly by Giorgione. In addition, the Castelfranco Altarpiece in his home-town has rarely, if ever, been doubted, nor have the wrecked fresco fragments from the German warehouse. The Vienna Laura is the only work <b>signed</b> <b>and</b> <b>dated</b> by Giorgione (on the back). The early pair of paintings in the Uffizi are usually accepted.|$|E
