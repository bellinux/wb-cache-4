40|$|BACKGROUND: in basketball, balance {{ability is}} {{important}} to reduce non-contact injuries. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate the effect of training on balance. METHODS: thirty-two healthy male volunteers were recruited from amateur basketball teams. They were asked to perform the Balance Error Scoring System BESS test in order to measure the number of <b>stability</b> <b>errors</b> in six conditions. The test was performed at the beginning of the season (T 0) and after 12 weeks (T 1). In both cases the test was carried out before (pre-session) and after a training session (post-session). RESULTS: the comparison of the total BESS scores both pre- and post-session showed a statistically significant increase of <b>stability</b> <b>errors</b> at both T 0 and T 1 (T 0 : pre-session 8. 6 ± 6. 1 errors, post-session 10. 7 ± 6. 3 errors; t=- 4. 03; p= 0. 002) (T 1 : pre-session 7. 2 ± 3. 8 errors, post-session 9. 1 ± 5. 4 errors; t=- 1. 93; p= 0. 03). Between T 0 and T 1 we noticed a reduction of errors which reached a statistical significance during the pre-session time (t= 2. 75; p= 0. 0049).
