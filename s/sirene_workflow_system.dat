40|$|Abstract. Although it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that <b>workflow</b> <b>systems</b> add value to business processes, no substantial research {{has been reported in}} the literature that confirms this. Most of the efforts in the field of <b>workflow</b> <b>systems</b> are devoted to issues that are relevant to the design and implementation of this type of systems.

In this paper, we present a model that measures the added value of <b>workflow</b> <b>systems</b> to business processes. We apply the model on two real-life cases in an IT company in the Netherlands. Although our model can be advanced with regard to several issues, the application of the model on the real-life cases resulted in valuable insight with regard to the impact of <b>workflow</b> <b>systems</b> for this company.

In this thesis we propose a <b>workflow</b> <b>system</b> {{that is capable of}} scheduling on all available compute resources, overlaps PCI express transfers, and manages the limited memory. A procedure for creating the <b>workflow</b> <b>system</b> is described and two case studies are analyzed. (i) Image Stitching, which implements the <b>workflow</b> <b>system</b> and achieves two orders of magnitude speedup over an image stitching plugin found in the popular Fiji ImageJ application.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade {{a new class of}} systems has emerged, which plays an {{important}} role in the support of efficient business process implementation: <b>workflow</b> <b>systems.</b> Despite their proliferation however, <b>workflow</b> <b>systems</b> are still being developed in an ad hoc way without making use of advanced software engineering technologies such as component-based system development and reuse of architecture artifacts. This work proposes a modern approach to <b>workflow</b> <b>system</b> construction. The approach is centered around a domain-specific software architecture metamodel (the REWORK metamodel) and a repository-based composition framework for <b>workflow</b> <b>system</b> construction out of reusable reactive components. The architecture metamodel defines the component and connector abstractions necessary for describing the static and dynamic aspects of a <b>workflow</b> <b>system.</b> The composition framework defines the lifecycle of a <b>workflow</b> <b>system</b> and supports the dynamic extension of a kernel <b>workflow</b> management <b>system</b> with application-specific elements. Appropriately, resulting systems are called REWORK systems. An event- and repository-based style underlies the REWORK framework. Events are the only component integration mechanism used in REWORK systems. Repositories support both system development by storing artifacts which are used for <b>workflow</b> <b>system</b> development and system operation by making explicit the structure of a running REWORK <b>system.</b> The iterative <b>workflow</b> <b>system</b> composition lifecycle proposed in this thesis comprises the following phases: the architecture analysis phase allows the identification and characterization of processing entities which participate in workflow execution; this phase is supported by a classification framework for processing entities in accordance to their integration-related properties. During the architecture definition phase <b>workflow</b> <b>system</b> components are defined and their behavior is tailored to specifications of workflows which are intended to be executed by the resulting system; furthermore, organizational relations and task assignment policies for these components are declaratively defined. The implementation phase is largely automated and consists in the instantiation of the defined components on top of an event-based operational infrastructure. As already mentioned the entire lifecycle is supported by repositories which store the <b>workflow</b> <b>system</b> artifacts. The iterative development comes into the picture once existing <b>workflow</b> <b>systems</b> have to be maintained either by adding new repository artifacts or by modifying existing ones. Thus, we dedicate a part of this thesis to the description of these repositories...|$|R
