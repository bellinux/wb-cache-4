25|$|When the infinitive has {{a subject}} of its own (that is, when <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of <b>the</b> infinitive is not co-referential either with <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> or <b>the</b> object of the {{governing}} verb form), then this word stands in the accusative case. When <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of <b>the</b> infinitive {{is the same as}} <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of <b>the</b> main verb (when <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> are co-referential), then it is usually neither expressed nor repeated within the infinitival clause. This omission is noticed also when <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of <b>the</b> infinitive, although not <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of <b>the</b> governing verb, is constructed in a higher syntactic level, e.g. as (any) object of the governing verb in any oblique case, or as a dative of interest with an impersonal verb or verbal expression.

50|$|Each {{of these}} {{sentences}} contains two verbal predicates. Each time the control verb {{is on the}} left, and the verb whose arguments are controlled is on the right.

5|$|Harris {{said that}} {{he came up with}} the idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre {{production}} of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. Kids Can Say No!, released in October 1985 on VHS in the United Kingdom, was the first British children's film about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, The Times obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using Kids Can Say No! or any other film to teach children about the <b>subject.</b> <b>The</b> Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of Kids Can Say No! and therefore broadcast it a second time that year.

Showings of Kids Can Say No! eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Hanna and Barbera jointly {{directed}} Puss Gets the Boot, {{which was}} nominated for an Academy Award for Best (Cartoon) Short <b>Subject.</b> <b>The</b> studio wanted a diversified cartoon portfolio, so despite the success of Puss Gets the Boot, Barbera and Hanna's supervisor, Fred Quimby, {{did not want to}} produce more cat and mouse cartoons believing that there were already enough cartoons of those in existence. Surprised by the success of Puss Gets the Boot, Barbera and Hanna ignored Quimby's resistance and continued developing the cat-and-mouse theme. By this time, however, Hanna wanted to return to working for Ising, to whom he felt very loyal. Barbera and Hanna met with Quimby, who discovered that although Ising had taken sole credit for producing Puss Gets the Boot, he never actually worked on it. Quimby then gave Hanna and Barbera permission to pursue their cat-and-mouse idea. The result was their most famous creation, Tom and Jerry.|$|E

40|$|This paper argues {{against the}} view that infinitive, or to be more precise, definitized clauses have <b>subjects.</b> <b>The</b> {{so-called}} infinitive <b>subjects</b> occur in three main types of construction: (i) <b>subject</b> of <b>the</b> infinitive introduced by the preposition for; (ii) either nominative or oblique (accusative) subjects of infinitives, and (iii) covert <b>subjects</b> of <b>the</b> infinitives. It is shown that these putative subjects have none of the relevant coding or behavioural properties of typical <b>subjects.</b> <b>The</b> so-called <b>subjects</b> of <b>the</b> infinitive are clearly semantic arguments of the non- finite predicate and their semantic interpretation depends {{on the meaning of}} the non-finite predicate, but they have not been grammaticalized as subjects...|$|R
